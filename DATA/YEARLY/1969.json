M.N.R., [1969] S.C.R. 330\nDate: 1969-01-28\nJ. Harold Wood Appellant;\nand\nThe Minister of National Revenue Respondent.\n1968: October 16; 1969: January 28.\nPresent: Abbott, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Pigeon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nTaxation\u2014Income tax\u2014Income or capital gain\u2014Mortgage acquired at a discount\u2014Whether amount of discount collected at maturity income\u2014Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, ss. 3, 139(1)(e).\nBetween 1956 and 1963, the appellant, a solicitor, acquired eight first mortgages and five second mortgages, all but two of them at a discount. The appellant\u2019s investments were made entirely from savings not from borrowings, and his income from this source was a relatively modest part of his gross income. In 1962, he was assessed for income tax on $700, being the amount of a discount he collected on a mortgage acquired in 1957 and paid off in full at maturity. The Tax Appeal Board upheld the assessment. The Exchequer Court found that it \u201cwas income from a source within the meaning of the opening words of s. 3 of the Income Tax Act\u201d. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court, where the issue was as to whether the discount was a profit from a business or adventure in the nature of trade by virtue of s. 139(1) (e) of the Act or whether it was a capital gain.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe amount received in 1962 represented a capital gain and not taxable income. The appellant\u2019s purchases were made entirely from savings, were not speculative and were made after inspection of each property. This pattern of activities was consistent with the making of personal investments out of savings and not with the carrying on of a business.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Revenu ou gain en capital\u2014Hypoth\u00e8que acquise \u00e0 escompte\u2014Le montant de l\u2019escompte per\u00e7u \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance est-il un revenu\u2014Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, art. 3, 139(1)(e).\nDurant les ann\u00e9es 1956 \u00e0 1963, l\u2019appelant, un avocat, a acquis huit premi\u00e8res hypoth\u00e8ques et cinq secondes hypoth\u00e8ques. Elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 acquises \u00e0 escompte \u00e0 l\u2019exception de deux. Les placements de l\u2019appelant provenaient de ses \u00e9conomies et non pas d\u2019emprunts, et son revenu de cette source formait une faible partie de son revenu total. En 1962, le Ministre a cotis\u00e9 l\u2019appelant pour imp\u00f4t sur le revenu sur $700, montant d\u2019un escompte per\u00e7u d\u2019une hypoth\u00e8que acquise en 1957 et enti\u00e8rement pay\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance.

Appel accueilli.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in an income tax matter. Appeal allowed.\nF. Stewart Fisher, for the appellant.\nG.W. Ainslie and J.R. London, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014The appellant, a solicitor who has practised law in the City of Toronto since 1928, was at all material times a member of the firm Mackenzie, Wood & Goodchild. That firm had a general practice which included a \u201cfairly substantial mortgage practice\u201d.\nThe firm, on behalf of clients, managed or supervised the collection of moneys lent on the security of mortgages and, between 1956 and 1963, the appellant had acquired personally an interest in thirteen mortgages. Eleven of these mortgages were acquired at a bonus or discount.\nIn July 1957, appellant, in association with a client, bought a first mortgage on which the amount then owing was $8,500 for principal, with interest at the rate of 6\u00bd per cent per annum. The term of the mortgage was five years. Appellant and his client paid the sum of $7,100 each of them putting up one-half of the purchase price. The mortgage was paid off in full at maturity in July 1962. Appellant was assessed for income tax in 1962 on $700 being his share of the discount on the said mortgage that, he had collected in that year.\nBefore the Tax Appeal Board, the assessment was upheld on the finding, not that it was a profit from a business but that \u201cit was a quasi-bonus\u201d, and therefore \u201cinterest per se\u201d.\nIn the Exchequer Court[2], Gibson J. did not wish to pass on the soundness of that conclusion and did not choose (those are his words) to make a finding that this was profit from a business. He expressly founded his decision on the basis that this \u201cwas income from a source within the meaning of the opening words of Section 3 of the Income Tax Act\u201d adding:\nas far as I know there is no decision of this Court or of the Supreme Court of Canada in which a question of this kind has been resolved by deciding that such a discount was income from a \u201csource\u201d within the meaning of the opening words of s. 3 of the Act, without deciding whether it was income from any of the particular sources detailed in s. 3 or elsewhere in the Act.\nFrom this judgment, appellant gave notice of appeal to this Court as of right, without apparently realizing that, due to the rate of tax payable, the actual amount in controversy was less than $500. Respondent also appears to have overlooked this point and did not move to quash but, on the contrary, signed an agreement as to the contents of the case and did not object to the appeal being inscribed for hearing. Before it came on for hearing, however, appellant applied for special leave to appeal and, in view of the importance of the question of law involved in the decision sought to be appealed from, leave to appeal was granted[3] by my brother Pigeon.\nAt the hearing before this Court, counsel for the Crown abandoned the contention that the payment of $700 received by appellant in 1962 was interest and conceded that the issue of the appeal turns upon a finding as to whether or not the said sum was profit from a business or adventure in the nature of trade by virtue of para, (e) of subs. 1 of s. 139 of the Income Tax Act.\nAlthough certain specified receipts are declared to be income for the purposes of the Act, the Income Tax Act does not purport to define income, it simply describes it. Section 3 mentions the three main sources of income (1) business (2) property and (3) offices and employment, but without restricting the general meaning of income as being income from all sources.\nThe task of determining the meaning of income for income tax purposes has been left to the courts. The English courts, whose decisions on this point the Canadian courts tend to follow, have determined the meaning of income for tax purposes without reliance upon economic theory. Income is to be understoood in its plain ordinary sense and given its natural meaning.\nSince income tax is levied on an annual basis and capital gains are not included in income for tax purposes, it is necessary to determine whether a particular receipt, in a particular taxation year, is an income receipt or a capital receipt. In the case of a mortgage discount, such as the one in issue in this appeal, it is now well settled that the answer to that question depends upon whether the amount received should be classified as income from a business or as an accretion to capital.\nIn Scott v. Minister of National Revenue[4], Judson J., after reviewing a line of cases in the Exchequer Court dealing with this problem, in some of which it was held that the taxpayer was engaged in investment, and in others in a scheme for profit-making, said at p. 225:\nThis diversity of opinion is understandable when the decision must depend upon a full review of the facts in each case for the purpose of determining whether the discounts can be classified as income from a business. Even on the same facts, there is room for disagreement among judges on the conclusions that should be drawn from these activities of a taxpayer, for the Act nowhere specifically deals with these discounts, as it does, for example, in s. 105 (a) with shares redeemed or acquired by a corporation at a premium. It is possible to deal expressly with the problem and the Act had not done so.\nThe appellant\u2019s investments, including investments in mortgages, were made entirely from savings not from borrowings, and his income from this source, including income from stocks and bonds, was a relatively modest part of his gross income. During the period from 1956 to 1963 inclusive, the appellant acquired eight first mortgages and five second mortgages all but two of them at a discount or bonus. This represents an average of one and one-half mortgages per year. The particulars of these mortgages are as follows:\n1956\u20141 mortgage\u2014$7,000\n1957\u20141 mortgage\u2014$7,100 (\u00bd interest)\n1958\u2014No mortgages\n1959\u20141 mortgage\u2014$2,500\n1960\u20142 mortgages\u2014$6,600\n1961\u20144 mortgages\u2014$22,412.20\n1962\u20141 mortgage\u2014$4,000.00 (no bonus or discount)\n1963\u20143 mortgages\u2014$17,000.00 (no bonus or discount)\nAs stated, appellant acquired his one-half interest in the mortgage in issue here in 1957, and it was the only acquisition in that year. Appellant\u2019s purchases were not speculative and, according to his evidence, they were made after he had inspected each property and reached a decision that each mortgage was a safe investment for him.\nIn my opinion, this pattern of appellant\u2019s activities was consistent with the making of personal investments out of his savings and not with the carrying on of a business. It follows that the amount of $700, received in 1962, represented a capital gain and not taxable income.\nI would allow the appeal and direct that the assessement be referred back for reconsideration in accordance with these reasons. The appellant is entitled to his costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacKenzie, Wood & Good-child, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

A few days after his arrival he purchased a revolver. This act infuriated his father who was still in an angry mood when he arrived home from work that night. The appellant, who had spent most of the day drinking beer with friends, telephoned home to say that he would spend the night with his grandfather. The father then went to the grandfather\u2019s home, walked in without knocking, went straight to his son and demanded the gun. The appellant replied that he was 21 and fired three shots at his father killing him. The appellant was charged with non-capital murder and was convicted of manslaughter. The Crown appealed on the ground particularly that the trial judge erred in his directions on the question of provocation. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial on the charge of non-capital murder. The accused appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nAssuming that there was any evidence of provocation, within the meaning of s. 203 of the Code, to go to the jury, the instructions given to the jury, with respect to the test governing provocation, were inadequate and the verdict might have been different had they been rightly directed in the matter. The determination of the question whether there had been any provocation sufficient to reduce the charge to manslaughter was subject to the dual test stated in s. 203(2) of the Code. The first is an objective test in which one must consider the effect, on an ordinary person, of the particular wrongful act or insult relied on. The character, background, temperament, idiosyncracies or drunkenness of the accused are excluded from the consideration on this first test. If that first test is satisfied, then the second, a subjective test, is to determine whether the accused acted actually upon the provocation, on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool. In the present case, one can hardly escape the conclusion that the jury must or may have been left with the impression that the test was whether the conduct of the appellant\u2019s father was of such a nature as to deprive\u2014not the ordinary man but\u2014the accused himself of the power of self control.\nDroit criminel\u2014Meurtre non qualifi\u00e9\u2014Ivresse\u2014Provocation\u2014Directives au jury sur la question de provocation non ad\u00e9quates\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 203. Apr\u00e8s une absence de quelque cinq ann\u00e9es, l\u2019appelant est revenu visiter ses parents. Quelques jours apr\u00e8s son arriv\u00e9e, il a achet\u00e9 un pistolet.

L\u2019appelant, qui avait pass\u00e9 presque toute la journ\u00e9e \u00e0 boire de la bi\u00e8re avec des amis, a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la maison pour dire qu\u2019il passerait la nuit chez son grand-p\u00e8re. Le p\u00e8re est alors all\u00e9 chez le grand-p\u00e8re, est entr\u00e9 dans la maison sans frapper, s\u2019est dirig\u00e9 directement vers son fils et a demand\u00e9 le pistolet. L\u2019appelant a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il avait 21 ans et a tu\u00e9 son p\u00e8re en lui tirant trois balles.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan1, ordering a new trial. Appeal dismissed.\nBrian A. Crane, for the appellant.\nSerge Kujawa, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by FAUTEUX J.:\u2014The appellant has been charged that he did, on the 20th day of December 1966, at Moosomin, Saskatchewan, unlawfully kill his father, Frank Albert Wright, thereby committing the offence of non-capital murder. Tried at Moosomin, in April 1967, before Davis J. and a jury, he was acquitted of this offence and found guilty of the lesser offence of manslaughter.\nPursuant to s. 584(1)(a) Cr. C, the Crown appealed from this verdict to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. By a unanimous judgment, the Court of Appeal[2] allowed the appeal, set aside the verdict of manslaughter and ordered a new trial on the charge of non-capital murder.\nAppellant now appeals from this Order pursuant to s. 597(2)(a) of the Criminal Code.\nIt is convenient to say immediately that we all agree that, for the reasons hereafter stated, there should be a new trial. In these circumstances, only what is essential to our decision should be said.\nThe evidence shows, beyond per adventure, that the father died as the result of being shot three times by his son, in the early hours of the 20th of December 1966. The circumstances leading to this tragedy are set out in detail in the reasons for judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Saskatchewan who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal. For the purpose of our decision, the following summary will, I think, be sufficient. Appellant was then 25 years old, married with one child. A few days before the fatal occurrence, namely on the 11th of December, he had returned from British Columbia to Moosomin, to visit his parents whom he had not seen since he had left for British Columbia in 1961. Prior to 1961, he was living with them in Moosomin and there is some evidence that, during that period, there were difficulties between him and his father who is said to have been a bad tempered and violent man and to have, on many occasions, abused and slapped his son. However, during this visit, the relationship was and remained happy and cordial until some time after 9.30 p.m. on December the 19th when, at the beverage room of the Queen\u2019s Hotel where he was employed as a tapman, the father was informed by one Bernie Myers, a friend of the appellant, that his son had just bought a revolver from him. The father then became infuriated and was still in an angry mood when he arrived home shortly after midnight accompanied by one Norman Hoey. He and his wife were worried that their son might commit suicide. Concerned with the whereabouts of his son, the father had enquiries made at the residence of the latter\u2019s maternal grandfather, Henry Hnatyczyn, and also at the residence of Myers. The appellant who had spent most of the day drinking beer with friends at the Queen\u2019s Hotel beer parlour and other places, arrived at his grandfather\u2019s home at about 2.15 in the morning of December 20th, after having had a late meal. He telephoned to his parents\u2019 place and informed his mother, who answered the call, that he would spend the night at his grandfather\u2019s. The mother testified that before she could hang up the telephone, the father shoved her, grabbed the telephone, said a few words and became furious as the son hung up on him. And the mother added that her husband then said I am going down there to get that goddam gun and I\u2019ll beat some brains into him that should have been done when he was a kid. Thereupon, appellant\u2019s father left, drove Hoey home and went to Hnatyczyn\u2019s residence. He entered the house through the porch door, without knocking, went straight to his son and with a voice showing authority and anger, said give me the gun. To this, appellant replied I am twenty-one and he then fired the three shots at his father. A few minutes later, appellant called the police and said I shot my father, come and get me.\nIn defence, the accused pleaded that he was affected by alcohol to a point of losing the capacity to form the intent requisite in a case of non-capital murder and he also pleaded that he killed his father in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation. On either grounds, the jury were invited by defence counsel to return\u2014as they subsequently did\u2014a verdict of manslaughter and not of noncapital murder. Hence the appeal of the Crown against this verdict. In the Court of Appeal, the Crown\u2019s complaints were directed particularly to the matter of provocation as to which it was submitted (i) that the trial Judge had erred in law in holding that there was some evidence of a wrongful act or insult, within the meaning of s. 203 of the Criminal Code, upon which the defence of provocation could be founded, and (ii) alternatively, that the trial Judge had erred in law in failing to instruct the jury adequately as to the test to be applied in the consideration of a plea of provocation. On the first submission, the Court of Appeal held that the evidence upon which the trial Judge relied, and upon which he instructed the jury, was not evidence of provocation within s. 203 Cr. C., but declared that it was not saying that there may not have been, in evidence, evidence of provocation to go to the jury. On the second and alternative submission, the Court of Appeal found that there was a serious error in law in the trial Judge\u2019s charge, in that, in dealing with the question whether the provocative conduct of the victim was of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control, he failed to instruct the jury that no consideration should be given to the quality of the relationship between the son and his father, or to the mentality of the son or to the fact that his mind may have been affected by alcohol. And the Court of Appeal, being satisfied that had there been no such error the verdict of the jury would not necessarily have been the same, directed the verdict of manslaughter to be set aside and ordered a new trial on the charge of non-capital murder.\nWe find it unnecessary to say anything and we are saying nothing on the question whether, as contended for by counsel for the appellant, there was, in evidence, any evidence of provocation\u2014within the meaning of section 203\u2014to go to the jury for, assuming that there was any, we are, for the reasons hereafter stated, in respectful agreement with the Court of Appeal that the instructions given to the jury, with respect to the test governing provocation, were inadequate and that the verdict might have been different had they been rightly directed in the matter. The determination of the question whether there had been any provocation sufficient to reduce a culpable homicide from non-capital murder to manslaughter is subject to the dual test stated in s. 203(2):\n203.(1) \u2026\n(2) A wrongful act or insult that is of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control is provocation for the purposes of this section if the accused acted upon it on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool.\nOne must then first consider the effect, on an ordinary person, of the particular wrongful act or insult relied on. In the words of Lord Simonds, L.C., the purpose of this objective test is \u2026to invite the jury to consider the act of the accused by reference to a certain standard or norm of conduct and with this object the \u201creasonable\u201d or the \u201caverage\u201d or the \u201cnormal\u201d man is invoked. Bedder v. Director of Public Prosecutions[3]. It is not enough, therefore, that an accused acted in a blind rage, if this first requirement of s. 203(2) is not satisfied. If it is satisfied, then the second branch of the enquiry, or the subjective test, is to determine whether the accused acted actually upon the provocation, on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool. While the character, background, temperament, idiosyncracies, or the drunkenness of the accused are matters to be considered in the second branch of the enquiry, they are excluded from the consideration in the first branch. A contrary view would denude of any sense the objective test. On this aspect of the matter, one may refer to what was said by Lord Simonds, L.C., at page 804, in the Bedder case, supra:\nIt was urged on your Lordships that the hypothetical reasonable man must be confronted with all the same circumstances as the accused, and that this could not be fairly done unless he was also invested with the peculiar characteristics of the accused. But this makes nonsense of the test. Its purpose is to invite the jury to consider the act of the accused by reference to a certain standard or norm of conduct and with this object the \u201creasonable\u201d or the \u201caverage\u201d or the \u201cnormal\u201d man is invoked. If the reasonable man is then deprived in whole or in part of his reason, or the normal man endowed with abnormal characteristics, the test ceases to have any value. This is precisely the consideration which led this House in Mancini\u2019s case (1) to say that an unusually excitable or pugnacious person is not entitled to rely on provocation which would not have led an ordinary person to act as he did. In Salamon v. The Queen[4], this Court, with a similar view of the law as to this aspect of the matter, indicated that, on the first branch of the enquiry, the jury should be directed that no consideration should be given to the peculiar or abnormal characteristics with which the accused may personally be invested. In the present case, nowhere either in the charge or the re-charge, can such a direction be found. On the contrary and notwithstanding that the provisions of s. 203(2) were read to the jury, on a consideration of all that was said to them by the trial Judge, one can hardly escape the conclusion that they must or may have been left with the impression that the test was whether the conduct of appellant\u2019s father was of such a nature as to deprive\u2014not the ordinary man but\u2014the accused himself of the power of self\u2011control.\nFor these reasons, we cannot accede to appellant\u2019s submissions that the jury were adequately directed with respect to the test governing provocation.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney General of Saskatchewan, Regina.\n[1] (1968), 3 C.R.N.S. 136, [1968] 3 C.C.C. 168.\n[2] (1968), 3 C.R.N.S. 136, [1968] 3 C.C.C. 168.\n[3] [1954] 2 All E.R. 801 at 804, 38 Cr.

The trial judge, having concluded that the appellant had intentionally effected the transactions in question, held that the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to create a false and misleading appearance of active public trading. The Court of Appeal set aside the verdicts of acquittal, held that the facts were not in dispute and that the only inference that could be drawn from them was that the appellant intended to create the false and misleading appearance. This, in the view of the Court of Appeal, raised a question of law so as to give the Crown a right of appeal under s. 584 of the Criminal Code. The accused appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the verdicts of acquittal restored.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Martland and Ritchie JJ.: There was dispute as to the vital question of fact whether the appellant did the acts which he is proved to have done with the guilty intention specified in the section. To determine whether an act, admittedly done, was done with a certain intention, it is necessary to inquire into the state of mind of the doer. Such an inquiry is as to a matter of fact. Unless the intention is expressed, it will be founded on an inference drawn from all the relevant circumstances. In drawing that inference, the Court is making a finding of fact. If the trial judge erred in finding that the onus, which was on the Crown to prove that the appellant did the acts complained of with the specified guilty intention, had not been satisfied, his error was one of fact. Sunbeam Corporation of Canada Ltd. v. The Queen [1969] S.C.R. 221, applied.\nPer Judson and Spence JJ.: The Court of Appeal has rightly concluded that the inference that there was an intent to create a false or misleading appearance of active public trading in a security, was irresistible. However, following the judgment in Sunbeam Corporation of Canada Ltd. v. The Queen, supra, the trial judge\u2019s error was one of fact and the Crown had no right of appeal under s. 584 of the Code.\nDroit criminel\u2014Appel\u2014Manipulations frauduleuses d\u2019op\u00e9rations boursi\u00e8res\u2014Conclusion que l\u2019intention criminelle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e\u2014Verdict d\u2019acquittement\u2014Inf\u00e9rence quant \u00e0 l\u2019intention est une question de fait\u2014Code criminel, 1953\u201154 (Can.), c. 51, art. 325(a), 584.\nL\u2019appelant, courtier depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 non coupable sur un acte d\u2019accusation contenant 29 chefs l\u2019accusant d\u2019avoir, avec l\u2019intention de cr\u00e9er une apparence fausse ou trompeuse de n\u00e9gociation publique active d\u2019une valeur mobili\u00e8re, fait des op\u00e9rations par l\u2019entremise des facilit\u00e9s de la bourse canadienne sur cette valeur qui n\u2019entra\u00een\u00e8rent aucun changement dans la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de cette valeur, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 325(a) du Code criminel. Le juge au proc\u00e8s a conclu que l\u2019appelant avait fait les op\u00e9rations en question intentionnellement mais statua que la Couronne n\u2019avait pas prouv\u00e9 hors d\u2019un doute raisonnable que l\u2019appelant avait eu l\u2019intention de cr\u00e9er une apparence fausse et trompeuse de n\u00e9gociation publique active. La Cour d\u2019appel a mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations de non culpabilit\u00e9, a jug\u00e9 que les faits n\u2019\u00e9taient pas contest\u00e9s et que la seule inf\u00e9rence que l\u2019on pouvait tirer des faits \u00e9tait que l\u2019appelant avait eu l\u2019intention de cr\u00e9er l\u2019apparence fausse et trompeuse.

Pour juger si un acte, reconnu comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 commis, l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 avec une certaine intention, il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019esprit de celui qui l\u2019a commis. Une telle enqu\u00eate porte sur une question de fait. A moins que l\u2019intention soit exprim\u00e9e, elle sera bas\u00e9e sur une inf\u00e9rence tir\u00e9e de toutes les circonstances pertinentes. En tirant cette inf\u00e9rence, la Cour en vient \u00e0 une conclusion de fait. Si le juge au proc\u00e8s a fait erreur en jugeant qu\u2019on n\u2019avait pas rencontr\u00e9 le fardeau, qui \u00e9tait sur les \u00e9paules de la Couronne, de prouver que l\u2019appelant a commis les actes dont on se plaint avec l\u2019intention coupable sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9e, son erreur en \u00e9tait une de fait.

Appel accueilli.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, allowing an appeal by the Crown against a verdict of acquittal. Appeal allowed. George D. Finlayson, Q.C., and Burton Tait, for the appellant.\nC.M. Powell, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to s. 597(2)(a) of the Criminal Code, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal[2] pronounced on April 8, 1968, setting aside verdicts of acquittal entered on February 9, 1966, by His Honour Judge Waisberg on twenty-nine counts in an indictment and ordering verdicts of guilty on each of the twenty-nine counts to be entered.\nThe respondent was tried before His Honour Judge Waisberg in the County Court Judges Criminal Court for the County of York. The trial occupied seven days. The indictment contained thirty-one counts. Except for differences in dates and in the number of shares all the counts were in the same words. Count 1 read as follows:\n1. REGINALD STUART LAMPARD stands charged that he, on the 7th day of January, in the year 1963, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, in the County of York, with intent to create a false or misleading appearance of active public trading in the securities of Dominion Leaseholds Limited, effected a transaction through the facilities of the Canadian Stock Exchange in the securities of Dominion Leaseholds Limited, to wit, 14,000 shares that involved no change in the beneficial ownership of the said securities, contrary to The Criminal Code.\nThe offence charged is that defined in s. 325(a) of the Code which reads:\n325. Every one who, through the facility of a stock exchange, curb market or other market, with intent to create a false or misleading appearance of active public trading in a security or with intent to create a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market price of a security,\n(a) effects a transaction in the security that involves no change in the beneficial ownership thereof,\n* * *\nis guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for five years.\nThe Crown offered no evidence on count 27 and consented to the dismissal of count 3. The charges contained in these two counts were accordingly dismissed. His Honour found the appellant not guilty on the remaining twenty-nine counts. The learned trial Judge found as a fact that the appellant intended to effect each of the twenty-nine transactions in the shares of Dominion Leaseholds Limited through the facilities of the Canadian Stock Exchange and intended that there be no change in beneficial ownership in the shares involved in the transactions. He acquitted the appellant because he was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to create a false and misleading appearance of active public trading in the shares.\nThere is no dispute as to the carrying out of the transactions. The appellant who had been in the brokerage business for many years was at the material times president of Lampard and Company Limited, a broker-dealer. The appellant had employed another person to run a publicity campaign in connection with the shares of Dominion Leaseholds Limited.\nThe trading by the appellant which resulted in the wash sales occurred on six different days in the months of January and February 1963, namely January 7th, January 22nd, January 23rd, January 24th, February 11th and February 18th.\nOn January 7th (counts 1, 2 and 4), the appellant placed orders to buy 41,000 shares at 50\u00a2, 1,000 shares at 49\u00bd\u00a2 and 3,000 shares at 51\u00a2. On the same day he placed an order to sell 46,000 shares at 50\u00a2. These orders resulted in three wash trades totalling 32,000 shares. On that day the total trading in the shares of Dominion Leaseholds on the Canadian Stock Exchange was 152,000 shares.\nOn January 22nd, 1963 (counts 5 to 15) the appellant placed seven orders to buy a total of 38,000 shares at 48\u00bd\u00a2 through six different brokers. On the same day he placed four orders to sell a total of 35,000 shares at 48\u00bd\u00a2. These orders resulted in eleven wash trades of 34,500 shares. The total volume of shares of Dominion Leaseholds traded on the Canadian Stock Exchange on that day was 38,500.\nOn January 23rd (counts 16 to 26) the appellant placed nine orders to buy a total of 173,500 shares through three different brokers at prices ranging from 50\u00a2 to 65\u00a2. He also placed two orders to sell a total of 147,500 shares at prices ranging from 50\u00a2 to 56\u00a2. These orders resulted in eleven wash trades of 143,000 shares. The total volume of trading in the shares of Dominion Leaseholds on the Canadian Stock Exchange on that day was 199,000 shares.\nOn January 24th (count 28), the appellant placed one order to buy 20,000 shares at 52\u00a2. On the same day he placed one order to sell 20,000 shares resulting in one wash trade of 20,000 shares. The total volume of shares traded on the Canadian Stock Exchange on that day was 25,000 shares.\nOn February 11th (counts 29 and 30) the appellant placed two orders to buy a total of 70,000 shares at 62\u00a2. On the same day he placed two orders to sell a total of 90,000 shares at 62\u00a2. These orders resulted in wash trades of 69,500 shares. The total volume of shares of Dominion Leaseholds traded on that day was 72,000 shares.\nOn February 18th (count 31) the appellant placed two orders to buy a total of 50,000 shares at 74\u00a2. On the same day he placed two orders to sell a total of 50,000 shares at 74\u00a2. These orders resulted in one wash trade of 25,000 shares. The total volume of shares of Dominion Leaseholds traded on that day was 60,150 shares.\nOn the buy side of the impeached transactions, the appellant employed seven different brokers and the orders were placed in the name of Lampard and Company as buyer. On the sell side most of the orders were placed through one broker, J.T. Frame and Company, but neither the appellant\u2019s name nor the name of his company appeared on such sell orders placed with that firm. Some of the sell orders with respect to transactions referred to in counts 20 to 26 inclusive and counts 29 to 31 were placed by the appellant with J.T. Leslie and Company showing Lampard and Company as seller. All the sales referred to above were carried out at the direction of the appellant.\nOn this evidence the learned trial Judge, having concluded that the appellant effected the transactions without change in beneficial ownership and that he did so intentionally, that is to say that it was not due to accident, mistake or inadvertence that there was no change in beneficial ownership, addressed himself to the remaining question as to whether the appellant did so with intent to create a false or misleading appearance of active public trading. The final conclusion at which the learned trial Judge arrived is expressed in his reasons in the following two sentences:\nI fail to see that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended to create a false appearance.\n* * *\nSo that I find that I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended to create a false or misleading appearance of active public trading and I cannot register a conviction. I have some doubt and the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt and I dismiss the charges.\nThe reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal were delivered by McLennan J.A. After setting out the details of the transactions he said in part:\n...To take for example the simple case proved with respect to count 28 where the respondent (i.e., the appellant in this Court) placed one order to buy 20,000 shares and one to sell 20,000 shares resulting in one wash trade of 20,000 shares. The total volume of shares traded on the Exchange on that day was 25,000 shares and the only real public trading that day was 5,000 shares.\nIt is, I think, irrefutable that a false and misleading impression of active public trading was created with respect to that count and so with all the other counts. The ticker tape records of the transactions impeached with respect to the total volume each day carried to a greater or lesser degree, depending upon the relationship between the wash trades and the total volume of shares traded, a false and misleading appearance of active public trading in the shares.\nThe respondent did not give evidence himself nor did he call any witnesses on his own behalf. He had been in the brokerage business for many years and must be taken in the absence of evidence from which some other reasonable explanation may be inferred, not only to have foreseen that each wash trade would create a false appearance of active public trading, but to have intended that result. In Regina v. Jay (1965) 2 O.R. 471 referred to by the learned trial judge there was evidence in the record that the accused had an intent other than the intent described in section 325. No such evidence of another intent is in the record in this case or can be inferred.\nThe record also discloses other matters relevant to the issue of intent. All the transactions set out in the 29 counts related to the shares of one company. They were carried out in substantially the same manner and on the sell side the name of the real seller was concealed altogether in most of the transactions and in part with respect to the others. In these circumstances when considering any intent with respect to any one count, it is proper to consider the conduct of the respondent with respect to the others in order to determine whether there was an intent to create a false and misleading appearance of public activity in the shares. Regina v. Stephens, 16 Cox. 387, C.C.R. referred to in Phipson on Evidence, 10th ed. p. 464, and such other authorities as Makin v. Attorney General of New South Wales (1894) A.C. 57; Harris v. Director of Public Prosecution (1952) A.C. 694; Regina v. Doughty (1921) 50 O.L.R. 360; Regina v. Mortimer (1936) 25 Cr. App. R. 150. Considering the transactions proved in the 29 counts, their proximity in time, the manner in which they were executed, including the subterfuge with respect to most of the sales, the employment of Roberts to run a publicity campaign with respect to the shares of Dominion Leaseholds, I can come to only one conclusion\u2014and in my opinion it is an irresistible one\u2014that the respondent was engaged in a scheme or plan to create a false and misleading appearance of active public trading in the shares of Dominion Leaseholds.\nCounsel for the respondent submitted that the finding of reasonable doubt of the learned trial judge was a finding of fact from which the Crown has no right of appeal by virtue of the provisions of section 584 of the Criminal Code. As already stated the facts are not in dispute and in such circumstances where there is only one reasonable inference to be drawn from the facts, if that inference is not drawn a question of law is raised. Edwards (Inspector of Income Tax) v. Bearstow (1956) A.C. 14; Bracegirdle v. Oxley (1947) 1 All E.R. 126 discussed and approved by this Court in Regina v. Sunbeam Corporation of Canada Limited (1967) 1 O.R. 661. Here the facts are not in dispute and as I have said the only inference that can be drawn from the facts in the record is that the respondent intended to create a false and misleading appearance of active public trading which raises a question of law and the Crown has a right of appeal.\nFor the reasons given, I would allow the appeal, set aside the verdicts of acquittal and direct the entry of verdicts of guilty on each of the 29 counts.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal in Regina v. Sunbeam Corporation of Canada Ltd. referred to and relied upon by McLennan J.A. was reversed by this Court[3] in a judgment delivered on November 1, 1968. I venture to think that if the Court of Appeal had had the advantage of reading the reasons of the majority of the Court in that case delivered by my brother Ritchie they would have come to a different conclusion.\nThe basis of the decision of the Court of Appeal is found in the sentence already quoted above:\n...Here the facts are not in dispute and as I have said the only inference that can be drawn from the facts in the record is that the respondent intended to create a false and misleading appearance of active public trading which raises a question of law and the Crown has a right of appeal.\nWith the greatest respect I am unable to agree that a question of law was raised. It is not correct to say that the facts are not in dispute. There is dispute as to the vital question of fact whether the appellant did the acts which he is proved to have done with the guilty intention specified in the section. To determine whether an act, admittedly done, was done with a certain intention it is necessary to inquire into the state of mind of the doer. That such an inquiry is as to a matter of fact has often been held.\nIn Clayton v. Ramsden[4], Lord Wright said:\nStates of mind are capable of proof like other matters of fact.\nIn Edgington v. Fitzmaurice[5], Bowen L.J. said:\nBut the state of a man\u2019s mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion. It is true that it is very difficult to prove what the state of a man\u2019s mind at a particular time is, but if it can be ascertained it is as much a fact as anything else.\nNothing that was said in regard to Bowen L.J.\u2019s celebrated dictum either in R. v. Dent[6] or in Cox and Paton v. The Queen[7] throws any doubt on the pronouncement that the state of a man\u2019s mind is a fact.\nUnless the doer of the act has expressed his intention, the finding as to what that intention was will necessarily be founded on an inference drawn from all the relevant circumstances proved in evidence. It has often been pointed out that where a trial judge makes findings of primary facts and draws an inference therefrom an appellate tribunal is in as good a position as was the trial judge to decide what inference should be drawn, but in drawing the inference the Court is making a finding of fact. In the case of an appeal at large the Court of Appeal has, of course, power to substitute its view, as to what inference should be drawn, for that of the trial judge, but where, as in the case at bar, the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is limited to questions of law in the strict sense it has no such power.\nWhen the onus of establishing a certain fact lies upon a party it may be a question of law whether there is any evidence (as distinguished from sufficient evidence) to prove that fact. In the case at bar the onus was, of course, upon the Crown to prove that the appellant did the acts complained of with the guilty intention specified in the section. If the learned trial Judge erred in finding that that onus had not been satisfied, his error was one of fact, certainly not one of law in the strict sense. The applicable principles are clearly set out in the reasons of my brother Ritchie giving the judgment of the majority of this Court in the Sunbeam case, supra, and it is not necessary to repeat them.\nIn a criminal case (except in the rare cases in which a statutory provision places an onus upon the accused) it can sometimes be said as a matter of law that there is no evidence on which the Court can convict but never that there is no evidence on which it can acquit; there is always the rebuttable presumption of innocence.\nNothing would be gained by my expressing an opinion as to what inference as to the intention of the appellant the learned trial Judge should have drawn from the primary facts which he found to have been proved. The Court of Appeal has said in the passage quoted above that \u201cthere is only one reasonable inference\u201d, that the conclusion that the guilty intention existed in the mind of the appellant is \u201can irresistible one\u201d, that it is \u201cthe only inference that can be drawn from the facts in the record\u201d. If I shared fully the view so expressed by the Court of Appeal, I would none the less be satisfied that the error (if such it were) made by the learned trial Judge in failing to draw the suggested inference was an error of fact.\nIn my opinion the Court of Appeal has fallen into the error of saying that the question of what inference should be drawn from certain undisputed facts is a question of law. Whether or not it is so must depend on the nature of the question as to which the inference is to be drawn. Here, as I have endeavoured to show above, the inference is as to the intention with which the appellant effected the transactions, that is as to the state of the appellant\u2019s mind, which is a question of fact.\nBefore parting with the matter I should point out that the Crown\u2019s appeal from the acquittal was based on and limited to a single ground stated in the notice of appeal as follows:\nThe learned Trial Judge, having found that the accused had effected the transactions alleged in the indictment, erred in law in holding that there was any evidence from which it could be inferred that the accused had any intent other than the intent alleged in the indictment.\nThis wording seems to me to suggest a misapprehension as to one of the cardinal principles of the criminal law. In order for the appellant to be convicted it was essential for the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did the acts complained of with the specified guilty intent. That is an onus which never shifts. It was not incumbent upon the appellant to show that he did the acts with some intent other than that charged in the indictment.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the verdicts of acquittal entered by the learned trial Judge.\nThe judgment of Judson and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The facts relating to the trading activities of R.S. Lampard, the appellant here, are fully set out in the reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal[8] and the reasons of the Chief Justice in this Court. Under s. 584(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, the Attorney General\u2019s appeal is confined to \u201cany ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone\u201d. The appellant here submits that if there was error in the judgment at trial, which he does not admit, it is error in fact.\nThe basis of the judgment of the learned trial judge, who was sitting without a jury, was that the trading activities of the appellant did not indicate to him beyond a reasonable doubt that they were carried out \u201cwith intent to create a false or misleading appearance of active public trading in a security\u201d. On the other hand, a unanimous Court of Appeal thought that the inference that there was such intent was irresistible.\nI agree with this conclusion of the Court of Appeal but we are still left with the question whether the error was one of fact or law. I am compelled by the majority judgment of this Court delivered in Sunbeam Corporation of Canada Ltd. v. The Queen[9] to hold that the error\u2014and I am sure that it was error\u2014was one of fact. The appeal therefore succeeds.\nAppeal allowed and verdicts of acquittal restored.\nSolicitors for the Appellant: McCarthy & McCarthy, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C.M.

They challenged the validity of The Communal Property Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 52, on the ground that the Act, the operation of which, it is alleged, prevents them from acquiring land, is legislation in respect of religion and therefore beyond the powers of a provincial legislature. The Hutterite colonies hold large tracts of land in Alberta and the effect of the legislation would restrict the colonies from acquiring additional lands. The actions were dismissed in the lower Courts. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeals should be dismissed.\nThe Communal Property Act was enacted in relation to the ownership of land in Alberta and the legislature had jurisdiction, under s. 92(13) of the B.N.A. Act, because it deals with property in the Province. The purpose of the legislation is to control the use of Alberta lands as communal property. While it is apparent that the legislation was prompted by the fact that the Hutterites had acquired and were acquiring large areas of land in Alberta, held as communal property, it did not forbid the existence of Hutterite colonies. The Act was not directed at the Hutterite religious belief or at the profession of such belief, but at the practice of holding large areas of Alberta land as communal property, whether such practice stems from religious belief or not. It was a function of a provincial legislature to enact those laws which govern the holding of land within the boundaries of that province. The fact that a religious group upholds tenets which lead to economic views in relation to land holding does not mean that a provincial legislature, enacting land legislation which may run counter to such views, can be said, in consequence, to be legislating in respect of religion and not in respect of property. Freedom of religion does not mean freedom from compliance with provincial laws relative to the matter of property holding.\nDroit constitutionnel\u2014Validit\u00e9 d\u2019une l\u00e9gislation provinciale limitant les achats de terres par des colonies telles que les Hutterites\u2014S\u2019agit-il d\u2019une l\u00e9gislation concernant la religion ou la propri\u00e9t\u00e9\u2014Est-elle intra vires de la province\u2014Communal Property Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 152.\nLes demandeurs, autres que les Fletchers, sont des Hutterites et font partie d\u2019une communaut\u00e9 religieuse dont la vie de communaut\u00e9 et la possession de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s sont fond\u00e9es sur des principes religieux. Ils ont attaqu\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 du Communal Property Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 52, pour le motif que le statut, dont l\u2019application les emp\u00eache, pr\u00e9tendent-ils, d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir des terres, est une l\u00e9gislation concernant la religion et par cons\u00e9quent au-del\u00e0 des pouvoirs de la l\u00e9gislature provinciale. Les colonies d\u2019Hutterites poss\u00e8dent de grandes \u00e9tendues de terre en Alberta et la l\u00e9gislation aurait pour effet de restreindre les colonies dans leurs acquisitions de terres additionnelles. Les Cours inf\u00e9rieures ont rejet\u00e9 les actions. Les demandeurs en appel\u00e8rent \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: Les appels doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s.\nLe Communal Property Act a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 par rapport au droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur les terres en Alberta et la l\u00e9gislature avait juridiction, en vertu de l\u2019art. 92(13) de l\u2019Acte de de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique, parce que le statut traite de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans la province. La l\u00e9gislation a pour but de contr\u00f4ler l\u2019usage des terres de l\u2019Alberta comme propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de communaut\u00e9. Bien qu\u2019il soit \u00e9vident que la l\u00e9gislation a \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e par le fait que les Hutterites ont acquis et acqu\u00e9raient de grandes \u00e9tendues de terre en Alberta, pour les poss\u00e9der comme propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de communaut\u00e9, la l\u00e9gislation ne d\u00e9fend pas l\u2019existence des colonies d\u2019Hutterites. Le statut ne s\u2019attaque pas aux croyances religieuses des Hutterites ou \u00e0 la profession de telles croyances, mais \u00e0 la pratique de poss\u00e9der comme propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de communaut\u00e9 de grandes \u00e9tendues de terre en Alberta, que cette pratique provienne d\u2019une croyance religieuse ou non. La l\u00e9gislature provinciale a pour fonction de d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter des lois pour r\u00e9glementer la possession des terres dans les limites de cette province. Le fait qu\u2019un groupe religieux observe une doctrine qui m\u00e8ne \u00e0 des vues \u00e9conomiques par rapport \u00e0 la possession de terres ne veut pas dire qu\u2019une l\u00e9gislature provinciale, lorsqu\u2019elle d\u00e9cr\u00e8te une l\u00e9gislation agraire qui peut aller \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de telles vues, peut \u00eatre en cons\u00e9quence consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant une l\u00e9gis- lation concernant la religion et non la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. La libert\u00e9 de religion ne veut pas dire libert\u00e9 de ne pas se conformer aux lois provinciales se rapportant \u00e0 la possession de terres.\nAPPELS de jugements de la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Alberta[1], confirmant un jugement du Juge Milvain. Appels rejet\u00e9s.\nAPPEALS from judgments of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division1, affirming a judgment of Milvain J. Appeals dismissed.\nMax Moscovich, Q.C., William B. Gill, Q.C., and I. Michael Robison, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nS. Friedman, Q.C., and W. Henkel, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nC.R.O. Munro, Q.C., and David Kilgour, for the intervenant.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014The question in issue in both these appeals is as to the constitutional validity of The Communal Property Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 52, as amended, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Act\u201d. In each of the two actions the real purpose was to obtain a declaration that this statute was ultra vires of the Legislature of the Province of Alberta and they were consolidated for trial.\nThe facts are not in issue. The appellants, other than the Fletchers, are Hutterians. The Fletchers are owners of land in Alberta which their fellow plaintiffs sought to purchase. The plaintiffs in the other action also sought to purchase Alberta lands. It is conceded that the lands in each case sought to be acquired would be held in common as defined in s. 2(b)(i) of the Act and that the operation of the Act prevents the acquisition of the lands. The appellants, other than the Fletchers, in each case formed part of a religious community which based its community life and its holding of property on religious principles.\nAs of December 31, 1963, Hutterite colonies held approximately 480,000 acres of land in Alberta and over 10,000 acres had been added in 1964. The approximate population of Hutterites in Alberta as of December 31, 1963, was 6,000.\nThe Act is described as \u201cAn Act respecting Lands in the Province Held as Communal Property.\u201d \u201cCommunal Property\u201d is defined in s. 2 of the Act, which states:\n2. In this Act,\n(a) \u201ccolony\u201d\n((i) means a number of persons who hold land or any interest therein as communal property, whether as owners, lessees or otherwise, and whether in the name of trustees or as a corporation or otherwise,\n(ii) includes a number of persons who propose to acquire land to be held in such manner, and\n(iii) includes Hutterites or Hutterian Brethren and Doukhobors;\n(b) \u201ccommunal property\u201d means\n(i) land held by a colony in such a manner that no member of the colony has any individual or personal ownership or right of ownership in the land, and each member shares in the distribution of profits or benefits according to his needs or in equal measure with his fellow members, and\n(ii) land held by a member of the colony by personal ownership or right of ownership or under a lease, if the land is used in conjunction with and as part of other land held in the manner described in subclause (i);\n(c) \u201cBoard\u201d means the Communal Property Control Board established pursuant to this Act.\nThe general scheme of the Act for controlling the holding of land as communal property is as follows:\nUnless otherwise authorized by the Lieutenant Governor in Council in the public interest (s. 5(2)) no colony existing on the 1st day of May, 1947, may increase the holdings of its land beyond its holdings on the 1st day of March, 1944 (s. 4(1)), or, if on that date the holdings were less than 6,400 acres, they may be extended thereto (s. 4(5)). The significance of the dates May 1, 1947, and March 1, 1944, referred to in the statute is as follows: The first Alberta legislation in relation to acquisition of land by Hutterites to come into force was The Land Sales Prohibition Act, 1944 (Alta.), c. 15, which came into force on March 1, 1944. In general that statute prohibited the selling of land to and the purchase of land by Hutterites. That Act, as amended, remained the law until it expired on May 1, 1947, and on that date The Communal Property Act, 1947 (Alta.), c. 16, came into force. So that between March 1, 1944, and May 1, 1947, no Hutterite could acquire any land in Alberta, but by virtue of the provisions of The Communal Property Act which came into force on the latter date the restrictions on the acquisition of land were lessened somewhat in relation to Hutterites and the new provisions were made applicable to all \u201ccolonies\u201d, whether Hutterite or otherwise.\nThe general scheme of the Act goes on to provide as follows:\nNo \u201ccolony\u201d which exists or existed outside the province may acquire land without the consent of the Lieutenant Governor in Council (s. 6).\nNo land may be acquired for the purpose of establishing a new \u201ccolony\u201d without the consent of the Lieutenant Governor in Council (s. 7).\nBy an amendment to the statute which came into force on May 1, 1951, the Lieutenant Governor in Council was authorized to divide the province into zones and to designate the number of acres a \u201ccolony\u201d established after that date may acquire in any zone or class of zones (s. 5(1)). By virtue of an amendment made in 1960, \u201ccolonies\u201d established after May 1, 1947, were also limited to the number of acres designated by the Lieutenant Governor in Council for each zone (s. 9).\nThe Lieutenant Governor in Council is authorized to establish a Communal Property Control Board (s. 3a(1)), which is to hear applications by \u201ccolonies\u201d for leave to acquire land. Where the application is for leave to acquire additional lands for a \u201ccolony\u201d already holding lands, the Board may grant or refuse the application, subject to an appeal to a judge of a district court by \u201ca person or colony not satisfied with the decision of the Board\u2026\u201d (s. 13, subss. (1) to (6)).\nWhere the granting of the application would result in the establishment of a new \u201ccolony\u201d, the Board is to give public notice of the application, and hold such hearings and make such inquiries as it deems necessary to determine whether the granting of the application would be in the public interest, giving consideration to the location of the lands applied for, the location of existing \u201ccolonies\u201d, the geographical location of the lands intended for communal use in relation to the lands not so used, and any other factors which the Board may deem relevant. Following its investigation the Board is to submit a report to the Minister of Municipal Affairs as to its recommendations in the matter. After consideration of the report the Lieutenant Governor in Council may consent or withhold consent as he deems proper in the public interest, irrespective of the Board\u2019s recommendation (s. 14).\nDispositions of land to \u201ccolonies\u201d which would result in contravention of the provisions of the statute are prohibited (s. 11).\nThe submission of the appellants is that the Act is legislation in respect of religion and, in consequence, is beyond the legislative powers of a provincial legislature. The respondent contends that the Act is legislation in respect of property in Alberta, controlling the way in which land is to be held, by regulating the acquisition and disposition of land to be acquired by colonies to be held as communal land.\nThe learned trial judge, Milvain J. (as he then was), held that, in pith and substance, the Act relates to land tenure in the province and is, therefore, intra vires of the Legislature of the Province of Alberta under s. 92(13) of the British North America Act.\nThis judgment was sustained on appeal[2]. Johnson J.A., with whom Kane J.A. concurred, while holding that the Act was aimed at controlling the expansion of Hutterite colonies in Alberta, and that living in colonies and holding land communally were tenets of the Hutterite faith, decided that, even though the Act, therefore, related to religion, it was valid because the province, under s. 92(13), had legislative jurisdiction in relation to religion.\nMcDermid J.A., with whom the Chief Justice concurred, decided that the Act related to land tenure, and that the fact that it might restrict the religious practices of the Hutterites did not render it invalid, even if provincial legislatures cannot legislate in relation to religion.\nPorter J.A. said that he agreed with Johnson J.A. and McDermid J.A. that the legislation was valid, but expressed doubts as to the adequacy of the material submitted.\nIn my opinion, the Act was enacted in relation to the ownership of land in Alberta and the Legislature had jurisdiction, under s. 92(13) of the British North America Act, because it deals with property in the province. The scheme of the legislation indicates that the Legislature considered the use of large areas of land in Alberta for the purposes of communal living was something which, in the public interest, required to be regulated and controlled. The Act restricts, but does not prohibit, the use of land for such purposes.\nIt would seem to me to be clear that a provincial legislature can enact laws governing the ownership of land within the province and that legislation enacted in relation to that subject must fall within s. 92(13), and must be valid unless it can be said to be in relation to a class of subject specifically enumerated in s. 91 of the British North America Act or otherwise within exclusive Federal jurisdiction.\nThere is no suggestion in the present case that the Act relates to any class of subject specifically enumerated in s. 91.\nIt was on the basis that the legislation in question in the cases of Henry Birks & Sons (Montreal) Limited v. The City of Montreal[3] and Switzman v. Elbling[4] related to the subject of criminal law, assigned specifically to the Parliament of Canada by s. 91(27) of the British North America Act, that the statutes were held to be ultra vires of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec.\nThe Birks case involved the validity of a statute which empowered municipal councils of cities and towns to pass by-laws to compel the closing of stores on New Year\u2019s Day, the festival of Epiphany, Ascension Day, All Saints\u2019 Day, Conception Day and Christmas Day. The legislation was supported in argument on the basis that it related to the control of merchandising and the well-being of employees. It was held to be ultra vires of the Legislature of Quebec because it authorized the compulsion of Feast Day observance, and such legislation in England, as in the case of Sunday observance legislation, had been assigned to the domain of criminal law. Legislation in this field was held to relate to the subject of criminal law, assigned specifically to the Parliament of Canada by s. 91(27). Rand J. went on to add that the legislation was in relation to religion, and beyond provincial competence, and he referred to the Saumur case. Kellock and Locke JJ. said that, even if it were not properly \u201ccriminal law\u201d, it was beyond the competence of the Legislature as being legislation with respect to freedom of religion, a matter dealt with in the statute of the Province of Canada of 1852, 14-15 Vict., c. 175, the relevant portion of which is quoted later in these reasons.\nSwitzman v. Elbling involved the validity of The Act Respecting Communistic Propaganda, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 52, which, inter alia, made it illegal for any person who possessed or occupied a house in the province to use it or to allow any person to make use of it to propagate communism or bolshevism by any means whatsoever. It was attempted to support the legislation on the ground that it dealt with property in the province.\nThe majority of the Court was of the opinion that the legislation was in respect of criminal law which, under s. 91(27), was within the exclusive competence of the Parliament of Canada.\nIt was submitted by the appellants that the Act is aimed at preventing the spread of Hutterite colonies in Alberta, that, because the maintenance of such colonies is a cardinal tenet of the Hutterite religion, the Act seeks to deal with religion, and that the subject of religion is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. Their position is stated in the reasons of Johnson J.A., in the Court below, as follows:\nThis Act then in its pith and substance is legislation restricting the acquisition by Hutterites of more land in the province. If a by-law which prevents the distribution of religious tracts (the Saumur case) was an interference with religion, I find it difficult to say that legislation which is aimed at the restriction of new and existing colonies and the holding of land in common as practised by these colonies when living in such colonies and holding lands in that manner are the principal tenets of Hutterian faith, does not also deal with religion.\nWith respect, I do not share this view. I do not think that the case of Saumur v. The City of Quebec[5] is analogous to the present one. The law, the validity of which was in issue there, was a by-law which forbade the distribution in the streets of the City of Quebec of any book, pamphlet, circular or tract unless the written permission of the Chief of Police to do so had been obtained. The granting of permission depended upon the content of the document proposed to be distributed. The by-law restricted, at the will of the Chief of Police, the dissemination, on the streets, of tracts dealing with religious, political or other views.\nOf the nine judges who heard the appeal, four (Rand, Kellock, Estey and Locke JJ.) held that the by-law was invalid, because it was legislation in relation to religion and free speech and not in relation to the administration of the streets, and was, therefore, not within s. 92(13). Two judges (Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau J. (as he then was)) held that in pith and substance the by-law was to control and regulate the usage of streets. They also held that freedom of worship is a civil right within the provinces. Two judges (Cartwright J. (as he then was) and Fauteux J.) held that it was within provincial competence to authorize the enactment of this by-law, and that provincial legislation in relation to matters assigned to the provinces is not rendered invalid because, to a limited extent, it interferes with freedom of the press or freedom of religion. Kerwin J. (as he then was), while holding that freedom of religion was a civil right within the province, held that to the extent that the by-law interfered with the profession of religion it was not applicable because of its conflict, to that extent, with the provisions of a pre-Confederation statute of 1852, of the old Province of Canada, 14-15 Vict., c. 175, which provided:\nThat the free exercise and enjoyment of Religious Profession and Worship, without discrimination or preference, so as the same be not made an excuse for acts of licentiousness, or a justification of practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the Province, is by the constitution and laws of this Province allowed to all Her Majesty\u2019s subjects within the same.\nThis provision continued to operate in the Province of Quebec by virtue of s. 129 of the British North America Act, which provides:\n129. Except as otherwise provided by this Act, all Laws in force in Canada, Nova Scotia, or New Brunswick at the Union, and all Courts of Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction, and all legal Commissions, Powers, and Authorities, and all Officers, Judicial, Administrative, and Ministerial, existing therein at the Union, shall continue in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick respectively, as if the Union had not been made; subject nevertheless (except with respect to such as are enacted by or exist under Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain or of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,) to be repealed, abolished, or altered by the Parliament of Canada, or by the Legislature of the respective Province, according to the Authority of the Parliament or of that Legislature under this Act.\nThe four judges who were of the opinion that the by-law was invalid reached that conclusion because they felt that it was not enacted in relation to the administration of streets but rather to provide a means of censorship of published material distributed on the streets. It restricted, inter alia, the dissemination of religious views.\nThe purpose of the legislation in question here is to control the use of Alberta lands as communal property. While it is apparent that the legislation was prompted by the fact that Hutterites had acquired and were acquiring large areas of land in Alberta, held as communal property, it does not forbid the existence of Hutterite colonies. What it does is to limit the territorial area of communal land to be held by existing colonies and to control the acquisition of land to be acquired by new colonies which would be held as communal property. The Act is not directed at Hutterite religious belief or worship, or at the profession of such belief. It is directed at the practice of holding large areas of Alberta land as communal property, whether such practice stems from religious belief or not. The fact that Hutterites engage in that practice was the circumstance which gave rise to the necessity for the Legislature\u2019s dealing generally with the holding of land as communal property, but that does not mean that legislation controlling the holding of land in that way is not in relation to property in the Province of Alberta.\nIt is a function of a provincial legislature to enact those laws which govern the holding of land within the boundaries of that province. It determines the manner in which land is held. It regulates the acquisition and disposition of such land, and, if it is considered desirable in the interests of the residents in that province, it controls the extent of the land holdings of a person or group of persons. The fact that a religious group upholds tenets which lead to economic views in relation to land holding does not mean that a provincial legislature, enacting land legislation which may run counter to such views, can be said, in consequence, to be legislating in respect of religion and not in respect to property. Religion, as the subject-matter of legislation, wherever the jurisdiction may lie, must mean religion in the sense that it is generally understood in Canada. It involves matters of faith and worship, and freedom of religion involves freedom in connection with the profession and dissemination of religious faith and the exercise of religious worship. But it does not mean freedom from compliance with provincial laws relative to the matter of property holding. There has been no suggestion that mortmain legislation by a provincial legislature is incompetent as interfering with freedom of religion.\nIn Carnation Company Limited v. The Quebec Agricultural Marketing Board[6], reference was made, at p. 252, to the distinction between legislation \u201caffecting\u201d the appellant\u2019s interprovincial trade and legislation \u201cin relation to\u201d the regulation of trade and commerce. In my opinion, the legislation in question here undoubtedly affects the future expansion and creation of Hutterite colonies in Alberta, but that does not mean it was enacted in relation to the matter of religion. The Act is in relation to the right to acquire land in Alberta, if it is to be used as communal property, and, in consequence, it is within provincial jurisdiction under s. 92(13).\nHaving reached this conclusion, it is unnecessary for me to express any opinion in respect of the submission of the respondent that legislation in relation to religious freedom falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of provincial legislatures, a view which was supported by three of the judges in the Saumur case.\nThe appellants also contended that the Act was in conflict with the statute of the Province of Canada of 1852, to which reference has already been made, it being contended that this statute was in force in Alberta by virtue of s. 129 of the British North America Act and ss. 3 and 16 of The Alberta Act, 4-5 Edward VII, c. 3. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta had held that this Act was in force in Alberta, in R. v. Gingrich[7]. I agree with the view expressed by Johnson J.A. and by McDermid J.A. that the effect of s. 129 of the British North America Act, which continued laws in force in Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick respectively, was only to continue that Act in effect in the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and not to make it a part of the law of any other province.\nIn any event, it may be noted that that statute protected the free exercise and enjoyment of \u201cReligious Profession and Worship\u201d. The Act does not interfere with the profession of the Hutterite faith or with religious worship in that faith. It controls the land holdings of colonies of people of that faith.\nI would dismiss the appeals with costs. No costs should be paid by or to the intervenant.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants Walter et al: Moscovich, Moscovich, Stanos & Matisz, Lethbridge.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants Fletcher et al: Gill, Conrad & Cronin, Calgary.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent: S.A.

Pacific Petroleums Limited, [1969] S.C.R. 394\nDate: 1969-01-28\nSinclair Canada Oil Company (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nPacific Petroleums Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1968: November 1; 1969: January 28.\nPresent: Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION\nContracts\u2014Interpretation\u2014Agreements entered into by oil development companies\u2014Whether appellant had contractual right to share in payment made by third company to respondent.\nUnder an agreement dated December 31, 1951, an oil company (Act) assigned its interests in certain petroleum and natural gas permits, which included four permits hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Act Permits\u201d, to the respondent. Act\u2019s right to convert a 25 per cent carried interest into a 25 per cent participating interest not having been exercised within the time provided for in the agreement, i.e. on or before August 1, 1953, the position of the parties, under the agreement, was that the respondent was assignee of all of Act\u2019s interest in the permits described in the agreement, including the Act Permits, and that Act was entitled to a 25 per cent interest in the gross proceeds of sale of production of all leased substances produced and marketed from all wells drilled on lands covered by the assigned permits after deduction of the payments and costs made by the respondent, as described in the agreement.\nUnder an agreement, dated January 22, 1954, between A Co. (the respondent\u2019s predecessor in title) and S Co. (the appellant\u2019s predecessor in title), S Co. acquired from A Co. the latter\u2019s right to enter upon certain projects (as defined in the agreement) to carry on exploratory and development work thereon for oil and gas substances. Included in these projects were lands covered by the Act Permits, as well as other lands.\nA further agreement (i.e. \u201cthe Amendatory Agreement\u201d) was made between A Co. and S Co. on December 11, 1954. Instead of agreeing to expend the sum of $5,000,000 in an 18\u2011month period, as provided in the agreement of January 22, 1954 (i.e. \u201cthe Basic Agreement\u201d), S Co. agreed to spend $10,000,000 during a period of 4\u00bd years. Instead of having to wait for the obtaining of commercial production from a project, to earn a 50 per cent interest in the project, S Co. acquired immediately a 25 per cent interest in all the projects, with the right to obtain an additional 25 per cent interest in any project from which commercial production was obtained. S Co. agreed to waive its right of recoupment of acquisition costs.\nAfter the making of the Basic Agreement and. the Amendatory Agreement, Act approached the respondent with a view to obtaining a renewal of the right which it had had, under the 1951 agreement, and which had expired before the Basic Agreement was made, to convert its carried interest under the 1951 agreement into a working interest. On July 31, 1956, an agreement was made between Act and the respondent which permitted this right to be exercised by Act, and it was, in fact, exercised by Act by notice dated June 1, 1962. Upon being notified by the respondent of the proposed revival of Act\u2019s conversion right, S Co. not only consented to the revival of this right, but expressed its willingness to forgo any claim for exploration costs recovered from Act if the conversion were effected by Act.\nFollowing the conversion of its carried interest into a working interest, Act paid to the respondent the amounts stipulated in the 1951 agreement, which related to all of the permits referred to in that agreement, including the Act Permits. The appellant, successor in title to S Co., had incurred total expenditures of $1,868,620.15 in relation to the Act Permits. It claimed from the respondent the whole of the payment of $467,155.04 made to the respondent by Act, which represented 25 per cent of the expenditures made in relation to the Act Permits, this being the amount which Act was required to pay to the respondent for the privilege of exercising the right of conversion.\nAn action brought by the appellant to enforce its claim was dismissed at trial and an appeal from the trial judgment was dismissed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta. On appealing to this Court the appellant abandoned its claim for the full amount of $467,155.04, which had been based on a claim for unjust enrichment. It contended that it was entitled to recover either: (1) $132,855.13, representing 25 per cent of the moneys paid by Act to the respondent, on the basis that it had acquired a 25 per cent interest in these moneys, pursuant to the provisions of the Amendatory Agreement; or (2) $205,194.45, representing the amount referred to in (1), plus an additional 25 per cent of the payment by Act in respect of a permit on which the appellant had completed a commercial well on April 24, 1958, as a result of which it claimed to have acquired an additional 25 per cent interest in that payment.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThere was nothing in the contractual arrangements existing between the appellant and the respondent (reference being made to the appellant and the respondent as though they were the actual parties to the Basic and the Amendatory Agreements, rather than the successors in title) upon which a claim to share in the payment made by Act to the respondent could be founded. That payment was made by virtue of contractual arrangements between Act and the respondent to which the appellant was not a party. Each of the alternative claims submitted by the appellant in this Court was dependent upon the appellant\u2019s establishing a contractual right to participate in the payment made by Act to the respondent, and, in the Court\u2019s opinion, no such contractual right existed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Kirby J. Appeal dismissed,\nD.P. McLaws, Q.C., and R.S. Dinkel, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nR.A. MacKimmie, Q.C., and G.W. Lade, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014By an agreement in writing (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Act Agreement\u201d) dated December 31, 1951, made between Act Oils Limited (hereinafter referred to as \u201cAct\u201d) and the respondent, Act agreed to assign to the respondent all of its estate, right, title and interest in certain British Columbia Crown Petroleum and Natural Gas Permits held by Act, which included permits numbered 38, 86, 90 and 98 (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Act Permits\u201d).\nClause 6 of the Act Agreement provided as follows:\n6. CARRIED INTEREST OF ACT\nThe Permits assigned to Pacific under the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by Pacific in trust for Act as to an undivided Twenty- five per cent (25%) net carried interest, being a Twenty-five per cent (25%) share or interest in the gross proceeds from the sale of production of all leased substances hereafter produced, saved, recovered and marketed from all wells drilled on any of the lands from time to time hereafter covered by the Permits assigned to Pacific under the terms of this Agreement after there shall have been deducted therefrom firstly the cash consideration paid by Pacific to Act as hereinbefore provided, secondly, all costs and expenses incurred by Pacific in the acquisition and maintenance by it of its interest in Permits Nos. 38 and 98 under the said Agreement dated the 8th day of November, A.D. 1950, determined in accordance with the provisions thereof, thirdly all costs and expenses, including Royalty, determined in accordance with the Scheduled Accounting Procedure hereto annexed as Schedule \u201cB\u201d and the further provisions hereof, incurred by Pacific in the exploration, drilling, development and operation of all the lands from time to time comprised within the Permits and the maintenance of the Permits in good standing.\nClause 8 of that agreement provided that the respondent should be the Operator of all lands comprised within the assigned permits.\nClause 12 of the agreement gave to Act the right, upon giving to the respondent 30 days\u2019 notice, at any time prior to August 1, 1953, to convert its 25 per cent net carried interest, as provided for in cl. 6, into a 25 per cent participating interest. It went on to provide as follows:\nUpon converting its interest aforesaid, Act shall pay to Pacific twenty-five per cent (25%) of all those costs and expenses which Pacific shall be entitled to recover out of the entire gross proceeds of sale of production prior to disbursing any moneys to Act in clause 6 hereof, calculated as of the expiration of such thirty (30) day period. From and after such date Act shall furnish its proportionate share of all costs and expenses for the maintenance, development and operation of the lands covered by the Permits assigned to Pacific under this Agreement and the provisions of the next succeeding clause hereof shall thereupon be and become operative in lieu of and in substitution for clauses 6 and 7 hereof, and Pacific shall stand possessed of the Permits in trust for itself and Act as to all its rights and interests thereunder and all production of leased substances from the lands covered thereby and all wells and equipment thereon in the following proportions, namely:\u2014\nPacific \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 75%\nAct \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 25%\nThis right was not exercised by Act within the time limited by cl. 12. After that time had expired, the position of the parties, under the Act Agreement, was that the respondent was assignee of all of Act\u2019s interest in the permits described in the Act Agreement, including the Act Permits, and that Act was entitled to a 25 per cent interest in the gross proceeds of sale of production of all leased substances produced, saved, recovered and marketed from all wells drilled on lands covered by the assigned permits after deduction of the payments and costs made by the respondent, as described in cl. 6.\nThis was the situation when an agreement in writing, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Basic Agreement\u201d, dated January 22, 1954, was made between Canadian Atlantic Oil Company, Ltd., hereinafter referred to as \u201cAtlantic\u201d, and Southern Production Company, Inc., hereinafter referred to as \u201cSouthern\u201d. The appellant is the successor in title to Southern, and the respondent is the successor in title to Atlantic.\nArticle I of the Basic Agreement defined various words and terms used in the agreement. Paragraph 1 of this Article provided:\n1. Where the word \u201cProject\u201d is used it shall mean, subject to the selection provided for in Schedule C hereof with respect to Projects B-4 and B-7 those tracts of land identified by Schedules A and B, and designated on one of the two maps by the corresponding number, and shall include the oil and gas substances within, upon, or under such lands and all rights, titles, and interests granted under or resulting from the reservations, permits, licenses, leases, deeds and grants pertaining thereto or concerning any part thereof, including renewals or extensions thereof;\nArticle II set out the covenants of Atlantic as follows:\nARTICLE II\nCOVENANTS OF ATLANTIC\n1. Atlantic undertakes and warrants that it is entitled to enter in or upon the Projects and to carry on Exploratory Work and development work thereon for oil and gas substances.\n2. Atlantic undertakes and warrants that Southern shall have the right, subject to the provisions of and, for any term of, this Agreement, to enter upon the Projects as listed in Schedules A and B and to carry on Exploratory Work and development work in the same manner and with the same rights as if such work was carried on by it. With respect to the Projects, Atlantic will endeavor to make such right of Southern exclusive.\n3. Except as otherwise specifically provided with respect to Projects A-2, A-7 and B-7 in Schedule C annexed hereto and made a part hereof, upon Southern completing the first Commercial Well on any Project, Atlantic will assign and convey to Southern an undivided one-half of its right, title and interest in such Project and will enter into an Operating Agreement substantially in the form hereto attached as Schedule D, providing for the joint operation and development of the Project. One or more separate Operating Agreements will be entered into for each Project.\nSouthern agreed to spend, during the period from January 1, 1954, to June 30, 1955, the sum of $5,000,000 in performing the obligations required to be performed by Atlantic under the terms of the various reservations, licences, permits, leases, deeds and grants to maintain Atlantic\u2019s rights in the projects and in performing such exploratory works as Southern might determine on such of the projects as Southern might select. Included in the projects described in the agreement were the lands covered by the Act Permits, as well as other lands.\nIt was agreed that Southern would be the operator of the defined projects, and provision was made for the recovery by Southern, from production, of its costs and expenses. This provision was contained in art. VI of the Operating Agreement which was annexed to the Basic Agreement.\nA further agreement, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Amendatory Agreement\u201d, was made between Atlantic and Southern on December 11, 1954. The major changes effected in the Basic Agreement by the Amendatory Agreement were as follows:\n1. Instead of agreeing to expend the sum of $5,000,000 in an 18-month period, as provided in the Basic Agreement, Southern agreed to spend $10,000,000 during a period of 4\u00bd years, from January 1, 1954, to June 30, 1958.\n2. Instead of having to wait for the obtaining of commercial production from a project, to earn a 50 per cent interest in the project, Southern acquired immediately a 25 per cent interest in all the projects, with the right to obtain an additional 25 per cent interest in any project from which commercial production was obtained.\n3. Southern agreed to waive its right of recoupment of acquisition costs, retroactive to the date of the Basic Agreement. \u201cAcquisition Costs\u201d were defined in the Amendatory Agreement as including \u201call exploratory work and any and all rentals payable under the terms of the Basic Agreement, as amended, plus direct and overhead costs to Southern as provided in the Basic Agreement\u201d.\nThe Amendatory Agreement also provided that art. VI of the Operating Agreement, previously mentioned, which provided for Southern\u2019s recovery of costs and expenses from production, should be deleted. All of the amending provisions in the Amendatory Agreement were made retroactive to and effective as from January 1, 1954. It was subsequent to the making of the Basic Agreement and the Amendatory Agreement that Act approached the respondent with a view to obtaining a renewal of the right which it had had, under the Act Agreement, and which had expired before the Basic Agreement was made, to convert its carried interest under the Act Agreement into a working interest. On July 31, 1956, an agreement was made between Act and the respondent which permitted this right to be exercised by Act, and it was, in fact, exercised by Act by notice dated June 1, 1962.\nBefore this amending agreement was made, Southern had been notified by the respondent of the proposed revival of Act\u2019s conversion right. No objection was taken by Southern, and, in fact, by its letters to the respondent, dated March 6, 1956, and May 11, 1956, Southern not only consented to the revival of this right, but expressed its willingness to forgo any claim for exploration costs recovered from Act if the conversion were effected by Act.\nFollowing the conversion of its carried interest into a working interest, Act paid to the respondent the amounts stipulated in the Act Agreement, which related to all of the permits referred to in the Act Agreement, including the Act Permits. The appellant, successor in title to Southern, had incurred total expenditures of $1,868,620.15 in relation to the Act Permits. It claimed from the respondent the whole amount of the payment of $467,155.04 made to the respondent by Act, which represented 25 per cent of the expenditures made in relation to the Act Permits, this being the amount which Act was required to pay to the respondent for the privilege of exercising the right of conversion.\nBefore this Court the appellant abandoned its claim for the full amount of $467,155.04, which had been based on a claim for unjust enrichment. It did contend that it was entitled to recover either:\n(1) $132,855.13, representing 25 per cent of the moneys paid by Act to the respondent, on the basis that it had acquired a 25 per cent interest in these moneys, pursuant to the provisions of the Amendatory Agreement; or\n(2) $205,194.45, representing the amount referred to in para. (1) above, plus an additional 25 per cent of the payment by Act in respect of permit 38, on which the appellant had completed a commercial well on April 24, 1958, as a result of which it claimed to have acquired an additional 25 per cent interest in that payment.\nIn respect of the submissions made by the appellant in this Court, the primary issue to be determined is whether, under the terms of the Basic Agreement and the Amendatory Agreement, the appellant has any contractual right to recover from the respondent either of the amounts which it now claims. For the purpose of greater clarity I will be referring to the appellant and the respondent as though they were the actual parties to these agreements, rather than successors in title.\nThe appellant\u2019s contention is that, by the terms of those agreements, the respondent assigned to the appellant a 25 per cent interest, not only in the oil and gas substances underlying the lands described in the agreements, but also an undivided 25 per cent interest in any benefits to be derived by the respondent pursuant to the various instruments by which the respondent held its interest in such oil and gas substances, and that, by accepting such assignment, the appellant assumed, in addition to its obligations under the Basic Agreement, an undivided 25 per cent of the obligation of the respondent contained in such instruments.\nThe granting clause, contained in the Amendatory Agreement (amending cl. 3 of art. II of the Basic Agreement), provides that:\nImmediately and upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Southern will be entitled to receive from Atlantic and Adherents, and Atlantic and Adherents will assign and convey to Southern an undivided one-fourth of their respective interests in the Projects, as defined in the Basic Agreement and in the Schedules attached thereto.\nThe definition of the word \u201cProject\u201d is contained in para. 1 of art. I of the Basic Agreement, which has already been quoted.\nIn my opinion, this definition covers certain tracts of land, described in the schedules A and B, and, specifically, oil and gas substances within, upon or under those lands. When the clause goes on to refer to \u201crights, titles, and interests granted under or resulting from the reservations, permits, licences, leases, deeds and grants pertaining thereto\u201d it is referring to rights, titles and interests in oil and gas substances derived from such instruments. The words \u201cpertaining thereto\u201d, which I have italicized, relate back to the words \u201coil and gas substances\u201d. The granting clause, therefore, refers to an assignment of a one-fourth interest in the assignor\u2019s interest in oil and gas substances in certain tracts of land, as derived from various instruments.\nThe schedule to the Basic Agreement, when referring to those projects with which we are here concerned, refers to a permit \u201cSubject to Act\u2019s 25 per cent net carried interest\u201d, or \u201cAct 25 per cent carried\u201d. What was assigned in respect of those projects was, therefore, one\u2011fourth of the respondent\u2019s interest in the oil and gas substances underlying the lands described in the Act Permits, which interest was subject to the 25 per cent net carried interest of Act, as defined in cl. 6 of the Act Agreement.\nThat clause, previously quoted, defined the carried interest as a 25 per cent share in \u201cthe gross proceeds from the sale of production of all leased substances\u201d produced and marketed from wells drilled on the lands described in the permits. Before Act became entitled to share in such proceeds, certain deductions were to be made, as defined in this clause.\nThe appellant\u2019s submission is that the assignment of the 25 per cent interest contained in the Amendatory Agreement assigned to it an undivided 25 per cent of the respondent\u2019s right to recover moneys from Act under that clause and that, consequently, when the right to convert was revived and Act made a money payment to the respondent to effect such conversion, its right continued and applied to those moneys. I do not agree with this contention. Clause 6 of the Act Agreement did not create a right to recover money from Act. It created, in favour of Act, a carried interest in the proceeds of sale of oil and gas substances. It is true that in computing the amount of money which Act would be entitled to receive, provision was made for the prior deduction from gross proceeds of sale of certain expenditures. It is also true that, to the extent of such deductions, the balance remaining, initially to the respondent, and, after the making of the Basic Agreement and the Amendatory Agreement, to the respondent and to the appellant, would have been that much the greater. But any benefit accruing to the appellant, if cl. 6 had remained operative, and no conversion had been effected by Act, was not by virtue of any assignment to the appellant of a right to recover money from Act. Such benefit would have accrued indirectly and only because it had an interest in the oil and gas substances and the proceeds of their sale determined after deducting therefrom the amount of Act\u2019s carried interest. What the appellant got as a result of the assignment was a 25 per cent interest in the respondent\u2019s interest in the oil and gas substances underlying the tracts described in the projects. In the case of the Act Permits, what it got was 25 per cent of the whole interest in those permits, less Act\u2019s carried interest, as defined in cl. 6.\nIt is my opinion, therefore, that at the time the Basic Agreement and the Amendatory Agreement were made, the appellant had not acquired by assignment any right to receive moneys payable by Act. Furthermore, since prior to the making of the Basic Agreement the right to convert by Act had ceased to exist, the appellant did not acquire, by virtue of the Basic Agreement and the Amendatory Agreement, any right to share in moneys which might be paid by Act in order to exercise its right of conversion.\nThe renewal of Act\u2019s conversion right was effected after the Amendatory Agreement had been made, with both the knowledge and the consent of Southern, the appellant\u2019s predecessor in title. The appellant did not stipulate for any share in the payment to be made by Act in order to exercise that right. On the contrary, Southern stated its willingness to forgo any claim thereto.\nIn the result, I can find nothing in the contractual arrangements existing between the appellant and the respondent upon which a claim to share in the payment made by Act to the respondent could be founded. That payment was made by virtue of contractual arrangements between Act and the respondent to which the appellant was not a party.\nThe foregoing reasoning applies equally to each of the alternative claims submitted by the appellant in this Court, for $132,855.13 and for $205,194.45 respectively. Each claim is dependent upon the appellant\u2019s establishing a contractual right to participate in the payment made by Act to the respondent, and, in my opinion, no such contractual right exists. In view of the conclusion reached in respect of the submissions made on this point, in this Court, it is unnecessary to determine whether, in any event, the appellant\u2019s claim would be defeated by virtue of the appellant\u2019s waiver of its right to recoupment of acquisition costs, as provided in the Amendatory Agreement, or on the basis of contract or estoppel arising from the exchange of correspondence between the respondent and Southern.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: McLaws & Company, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: MacKimmie, Matthews, Wood, Phillips & Smith, Calgary.\n[1] (1968), 67 D.L.R.

In the four months ending April 30, 1962, its first fiscal period, the respondent\u2019s new firm suffered a loss, of which the respondent\u2019s share was $6,902.89. He contended that he had the right under s. 27(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act to carry back this 1962 business loss as a deduction from his 1961 income. The Minister contended that the loss should be deducted first from the respondent\u2019s other income in 1962, which in fact exceeded the amount of the loss, and issued a revised assessment for the year 1961 in which he refused the deduction of the 1962 business loss. The respondent objected to his assessment for the year 1961. The Tax Appeal Board affirmed the assessment. The Exchequer Court reversed this decision and held that the respondent was entitled to carry back his loss to the year 1961. It was held by the Court that the respondent had the option of deducting the loss from his other income in the same year or of carrying it back to the preceding taxation year.\nA second issue related to a payment received in 1963 by the respondent in respect of his interest in the former law firm. Pursuant to a clause in the partnership agreement, it was decided to pay the respondent, as a withdrawing partner, the sum of $39,589.20 over a four\u2011year period in respect of his share of the 1962 profits in the old firm, and $9,897.30 of this amount was received by him in 1963. The Minister taxed the $9,897.30 as income received in 1963. The respondent contended that the amount should be treated as a capital receipt, and alternatively, if it was income, that it was taxable in 1962 rather than in 1963. The Tax Appeal Board upheld the Minister\u2019s assessment, but the Exchequer Court held that the payment of $9,897.30 was not income to the respondent. The Minister appealed to this Court on both issues.\nHeld: The Minister\u2019s appeal should be allowed on both issues.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Judson, Hall and Spence JJ.: It appears to be implicit in the wording of s. 139(1)(x) of the Income Tax Act that a business loss shall operate to reduce the taxpayer\u2019s income from other sources for the purpose of income tax for the year in which it was sustained. If the income from other sources in the current taxation year is less than the business loss, the amount by which the loss exceeds the income from other sources will be deductible in other years as provided by s. 27(1)(e) of the Act. It was extremely difficult if not impossible to make a perfectly logical and satisfactory reconciliation of all the provisions of the Income Tax Act which bear upon this question. However, the result arrived at by the Tax Appeal Board correctly expressed the intention of Parliament in enacting these provisions.\nThe sum of $39,589.20 allocated to the respondent pursuant to the partnership agreement was received by the respondent as income and not as capital. The respondent had at all relevant times computed his income on a cash receipt basis. When the decision was made in 1963 to pay him, he acquired a contractual right to receive payment in equal annual instalments in the years 1963 and following. Each instalment formed part of the respondent\u2019s income in the year in which it was received by him. This result was not altered by the terms of s. 6(1)(c) of the Act.\nPer Pigeon J.: The construction placed on s. 139(1)(x) of the Act by the Exchequer Court that the appellant had an option of either deducting the business loss from his other income in the same year or of carrying it back to the preceding taxation year, is not supported by any argument and cannot be reconciled with the text. However, it was not necessary in this case to ascertain the extent to which a business loss operates to reduce income from other sources in the same year because there was no appeal from the respondent\u2019s assessment for the year 1962 in which the Minister had applied the business loss suffered in the year against other income in that same year. The appeal was from the 1961 revised assessment. The Courts could not revise the 1962 assessment. Under s. 46(7) of the Act, it was only by an objection. made in proper time and an appeal, if necessary, that the respondent could prevent his 1962 business loss from operating to reduce his other income in that year by virtue of the assessment. Construing the partnership agreement as written, the intention of the parties was that the payment to a withdrawing partner should be an allocation of profits, in this case, the profits of the partnership in the year 1962. There is nothing to show that the true nature of the payment was of a capital nature. The wording of the provision for the allowance to a withdrawing partner showed that it was not intended to be a capital payment for goodwill but an allocation of profits, and this is conclusive evidence that it was income of the recipient. Furthermore, under s. 6(1)(c) of the Act and under the method followed by the respondent of reporting his income as received, he was properly assessed for the payment made by his former firm in the year in which he actually received it. Section 15(1) of the Act was not applicable since he was not a partner of his former firm in the year 1962.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Perte commerciale\u2014Doit-elle \u00eatre d\u00e9duite en premier lieu des autres revenus de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e\u2014Le contribuable a-t-il droit de reporter la perte comme une d\u00e9duction dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de\u2014Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, art. 2, 8, 4, 6, 27(1)(e), 139(1)(x).\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\u2014Paiement fait \u00e0 un associ\u00e9 d\u00e9missionnaire\u2014S\u2019agit-il d\u2019un revenu ou d\u2019un capital\u2014S\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un revenu, en quelle ann\u00e9e est-il imposable\u2014Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, art. 6(1)(c), 15(1).\nA la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1961, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 d\u2019une \u00e9tude d\u2019avocats dont il \u00e9tait un des associ\u00e9s et a \u00e9tabli sa propre \u00e9tude. Durant sa premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode fiscale, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire les quatre mois finissant le 30 avril 1962, la nouvelle \u00e9tude de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a subi une perte dont la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 revenait \u00e0 $6,902.89. Ce dernier a pr\u00e9tendu qu\u2019il avait droit en vertu de l\u2019art. 27(1(e) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu de reporter cette perte commerciale de 1962 comme d\u00e9duction de son revenu de 1961. Le Ministre a soutenu que la perte devait \u00eatre d\u00e9duite en premier lieu des autres revenus de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1962, qui en fait exc\u00e9daient le montant de la perte, et il a \u00e9mis une cotisation amend\u00e9e pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1961 dans laquelle il refusa la d\u00e9duction de la perte de 1962. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a produit une opposition \u00e0 sa cotisation pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1961. La Commission d\u2019appel de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a confirm\u00e9 la cotisation. La Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a infirm\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision et a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait droit de reporter la perte \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1961. La Cour statua que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait le choix de d\u00e9duire la perte de ses autres revenus de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e ou de la reporter \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition qui pr\u00e9c\u00e9dait.\nUn second point concernait un paiement re\u00e7u en 1963 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 en consid\u00e9ration de son int\u00e9r\u00eat dans l\u2019ancienne \u00e9tude d\u2019avocats. Selon une clause du contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de payer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, comme associ\u00e9 d\u00e9missionnaire, la somme de $39,589.20 \u00e0 \u00eatre vers\u00e9e sur une p\u00e9riode de quatre ann\u00e9es en consid\u00e9ration de sa part des profits de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1962 de son ancienne \u00e9tude. En 1963, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a re\u00e7u $9,897.30 de ce montant. Le Ministre a cotis\u00e9 cette somme comme un revenu re\u00e7u en 1963. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a soutenu que ce montant devait \u00eatre trait\u00e9 comme un capital, et alternativement, s\u2019il \u00e9tait un revenu, qu\u2019il devait \u00eatre cotis\u00e9 en 1962 plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en 1963. La Commission d\u2019appel de l\u2019imp\u00f4t a maintenu la cotisation du Ministre, mais la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a statu\u00e9 que le paiement de $9,897.30 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un revenu pour l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le Ministre en appela \u00e0 cette Cour sur les deux points.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel du Ministre doit \u00eatre accueilli sur les deux points.\nLe Juge en Chef Cartwright et les Juges Judson, Hall et Spence: Il semble clair du texte de l\u2019art. 139(1)(x) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu qu\u2019une perte commerciale a pour effet de r\u00e9duire le revenu du contribuable retir\u00e9 d\u2019autres sources aux fins de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e dans laquelle elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 subie. Si le revenu retir\u00e9 des autres sources dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition courante est moins que la perte commerciale, l\u2019exc\u00e9dent de la perte sur le revenu provenant des autres sources pourra \u00eatre d\u00e9duit dans les autres ann\u00e9es tel que pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019art. 27(1(e) de la Loi. Il est extr\u00eamement difficile sinon impossible de r\u00e9concilier d\u2019une fa\u00e7on logique et satisfaisante toutes les dispositions de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu qui traitent de cette question. Cependant, le r\u00e9sultat atteint par la Commission d\u2019appel de l\u2019imp\u00f4t exprime correctement l\u2019intention que le Parlement avait en d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant ces dispositions.\nLa somme de $39,589.20 attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 en vertu du contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue par lui comme revenu et non pas comme capital. Durant toute la p\u00e9riode critique l\u2019intim\u00e9 a calcul\u00e9 son revenu d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019encaissement. Lorsqu\u2019il fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en 1963 de lui payer ce montant, il a acquis le droit contractuel de recevoir paiement en quatre versements annuels \u00e9gaux dans les ann\u00e9es 1963 et suivantes. Chaque versement a fait partie du revenu de l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e dans laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u par lui. Les termes de l\u2019art. 6(1)(c) de la Loi ne changent pas ce r\u00e9sultat.\nLe Juge Pigeon: La Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019art. 139(1)(x) de la Loi comme donnant \u00e0 l\u2019appelant le choix soit de d\u00e9duire la perte commerciale de ses autres revenus de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e ou de la reporter \u00e0 l\u2019ann\u00e9e d\u2019imposition pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Cette interpr\u00e9tation n\u2019est support\u00e9e par aucun argument et ne peut pas \u00eatre concili\u00e9e avec le texte. Cependant, dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quel point une perte commerciale a pour effet de r\u00e9duire le revenu retir\u00e9 d\u2019autres sources dans la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu appel de la cotisation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1962 dans laquelle le Ministre a d\u00e9duit la perte commerciale subie durant l\u2019ann\u00e9e des autres revenus de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e. L\u2019appel est de la cotisation amend\u00e9e de 1961. Les tribunaux ne peuvent pas amender la cotisation de 1962. En vertu de l\u2019art. 46(7) de la Loi, c\u2019est seulement en produisant une opposition dans les d\u00e9lais et un appel, si n\u00e9cessaire, que l\u2019intim\u00e9 pouvait emp\u00eacher sa perte commerciale de 1962 d\u2019avoir pour effet de r\u00e9duire ses autres revenus de cette ann\u00e9e en vertu de la cotisation.\nInterpr\u00e9tant le contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 tel que r\u00e9dig\u00e9, c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019intention des parties que le paiement \u00e0 un associ\u00e9 d\u00e9missionnaire soit une r\u00e9partition des profits, dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, ceux de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1962. Il n\u2019y a rien qui d\u00e9montre que de sa vraie nature le paiement \u00e9tait un capital. Le texte de la disposition concernant l\u2019allocation \u00e0 un associ\u00e9 d\u00e9missionnaire montre qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas cens\u00e9e \u00eatre un paiement en capital pour l\u2019achalandage mais une r\u00e9partition des profits. Cela est une preuve concluante qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un revenu pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. De plus, en vertu de l\u2019art. 6(1)(c) de la Loi et en vertu de la m\u00e9thode adopt\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9clarer son revenu d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019encaisse- ment, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement cotis\u00e9 pour le paiement vers\u00e9 par son ancienne \u00e9tude dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e durant laquelle il l\u2019a effectivement re\u00e7u. L\u2019article 15(1) de la Loi n\u2019a pas d\u2019application puisque l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un associ\u00e9 de son ancienne \u00e9tude durant l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1962.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement du Juge Gibson de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier du Canada[1], en mati\u00e8re d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu. Appel accueilli.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in an income tax matter. Appeal allowed.\nG.W. Ainslie and F.P. Dioguardi, for the appellant.\nW.Z. Estey, Q.C., and A. Englander, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Judson, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014The relevant facts are set out in the reasons of my brother Pigeon which I have had the advantage of reading.\nOn the first question, that is whether the respondent was entitled to carry back the business loss of $6,902.29 which he sustained in his 1962 taxation year as a deduction to be made in computing his taxable income for his 1961 taxation year, I agree with the conclusion of the learned member of the Tax Appeal Board, Mr. J.O. Weldon, Q.C.\nIt is true, as my brother Pigeon points out, that the decision of Mr. Weldon is based mainly upon the wording of s. 139(1)(x) of the Income Tax Act which is an interpretation section. Just over a hundred years ago Cockburn C.J. in Wakefield Board of Health v. West Riding and Grimsby Railway Company[2] said at p. 801:\nI hope the time will come when we shall see no more of interpretation clauses, for they generally lead to confusion.\nThat hope has not been fulfilled and how profoundly the substantive law can be affected by the wording of an interpretation clause is shown by such cases as Klippert v. The Queen[3]. It appears to me to be implicit in the wording of s. 139(1)(x) that a business loss shall operate to reduce the taxpayer\u2019s income from other sources for the purpose of income tax for the year in which it was sustained and that the reason that the provisions of s. 27(1)(e) do not refer to business losses sustained in the current taxation year is that if the income from other sources during that year exceeded the business losses the whole of those losses will have been deducted by virtue of s. 139(1)(a). If, on the other hand, the income from other sources in the current taxation year was less than the business loss, the amount by which the loss exceeded the income from other sources would be deductible in other years as provided by s. 27(1)(e). I agree with my brother Pigeon that it is extremely difficult if not impossible to make a perfectly logical and satisfactory reconciliation of all the provisions of the Income Tax Act which bear upon this question, but it appears to me to be our duty to endeavour to ascertain the intention of Parliament in enacting these provisions and, in my opinion, the result arrived at by Mr. Weldon correctly expresses that intention. Should we be wrong in so deciding Parliament can deal with the matter by amendment. Having reached this conclusion, it becomes unnecessary for me to consider the effect of the business loss of $6,902.29 having in fact been deducted from the respondent\u2019s income from other sources for purpose of income tax for his 1962 taxation year which is dealt with in the reasons of my brother Pigeon and I express no opinion upon it.\nIt is next necessary to consider (a) whether the sum of $39,589.20 allocated to the respondent pursuant to clause 14(b) of the partnership agreement, quoted in the reasons of my brother Pigeon, was a capital payment or forms part of the income of the respondent and (b) if it is held to be income, in what taxation year or years it should be included in the calculation of the respondent\u2019s income.\nAs to (a) I agree with the conclusion of my brother Pigeon and that of Mr. Weldon that the sum in question is received by the respondent as income and not as capital. I do not find it necessary to add anything to the reasons which they have given for reaching this conclusion.\nAs to (b), the respondent had at all relevant times computed his income on a cash received basis. He was not entitled to receive any part of the sum of $39,589.20 until the decision of the Management Committee to allot that amount to him was made early in 1963. He did not, upon that decision being made, become the owner of that sum or entitled to withdraw it but had a contractual right to receive payment of it in equal annual instalments of $9,897.30 in the years 1963, 1964, 1965 and 1966. Each instalment forms part of the respondent\u2019s income in the year in which it was received by him. For the reasons given by my brother Pigeon I agree with his conclusion that this result is not altered by the terms of s. 6(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act. It was therefore correct for the appellant to include the sum of $9,897.30 received by the respondent in 1963 in the computation of his income for that year.\nFor these reasons, I would allow the appeal with costs in this Court and in the Exchequer Court, set aside the judgment of the Exchequer Court and restore the decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board.\nPIGEON J.:\u2014The respondent is a barrister practising in Toronto. At the end of the year 1961 he resigned his partnership in the law firm Borden, Elliott, Kelley & Palmer and established a new firm under the name of Wahn, McAlpine, Mayer, Smith, Creber, Lyons, Torrance & Stevenson. This new firm elected to end its fiscal year on April 30 and consequently its 1962 fiscal year was a four-month period. The audited financial statement for that period showed a deficit of which respondent\u2019s share was $6,516.39. After adding to this loss $386.50 for expenses incurred during the year 1962 in connection with the practice of his profession, he sought to have the total of $6,902.89 carried back to the year 1961 against his. substantial professional income for that year.\nThe Minister took the view that the 1962 loss had to be deducted first from other income in the same year and, as there was in that year other income (mostly from an office or employment) to an amount exceeding the aforementioned loss and all other allowable deductions, he assessed respondent for 1962 on that basis. For the year 1961 he issued a revised assessment in which it is expressly stated that the deduction of the 1962 business loss is refused for the reason that it \u201chas previously been allowed as a deduction from other income in 1962\u201d. Seeing that respondent had a substantial professional income in 1961 while his other income in 1962 exceeded his allowable deductions and the aforementioned loss by a very small sum only, the progressive character of our income tax results in the respondent obtaining for the 1962 loss by such assessment an income tax credit that is only a small fraction of that which he would obtain if allowed to carry it back to the year 1961.\nRespondent objected to his assessment for the year 1961 and the Minister refused to modify it.\nOn appeal to the Tax Appeal Board, the assessment was affirmed (J.O. Weldon, February 15, 1967). This decision was based essentially on the statutory definition of loss in para. (x) of s. 139(1) of the Income Tax Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act):\n(x) \u201closs\u201d means a loss computed by applying the provisions of this Act respecting computation of income from a business mutatis mutandis (but not including in the computation a dividend or part of a dividend the amount whereof would be deductible under section 28 in computing taxable income) minus any amount by which a loss operated to reduce the taxpayer\u2019s income from other sources for purpose of income tax for the year in which it was sustained.\nThis was apparently taken to mean that a business loss always so operates to reduce the income from all other sources in the same year.\nOn a further appeal to the Exchequer Court[4] Gibson J. took a different view. He held that the taxpayer was entitled to carry back his loss to the year 1961, saying:\nBy reason of section 139(1)(x) of the Income Tax Act the appellant had the option to deduct this 1962 business loss from his 1962 non-business other income but it was not mandatory for him to do so and he did not do so.\nI must say at the outset that I cannot agree with this construction of the Act. It is not supported by any argument and I cannot reconcile it with the text. A reading of the whole Act shows that where it is intended that a taxpayer shall have an option, this is clearly indicated. In my view, the last part of the definition of loss is not intended to define the extent to which a loss operates to reduce income from other sources in the year in which it is sustained. That part of the definition clearly means one thing only and that is that the word \u201closs\u201d applies only to what remains of the loss after deducting therefrom whatever part has operated to reduce the income from other sources in the year in which it was sustained. It is equally clear that one must look to the substantive provisions of the Act in order to ascertain the extent to which a loss so operates: the definition does not purport to indicate such extent. Of course it does imply that it may so operate but it does not specify in which circumstances or to what extent. One cannot read into this definition any intention to enact a substantive rule such as that a business loss does not operate to reduce the income from other sources in the current year except at the option of the taxpayer or that it always does so operate. It may happen that substantive provisions creep into statutory definitions but this is not to be presumed.\nIt is therefore necessary to examine the whole Act in order to ascertain the extent to which a business loss operates to reduce income from other sources in the same year. This is by no means an easy task.\nIn the first place, it is apparent that the definition was drawn up essentially for the purposes of para. (e) of s. 27(1) respecting the deduction of business losses. This provision deals with such deduction only in the immediately preceding and the five immediately following taxation years and not in the year in which they are sustained. It is in Division C dealing with deductions in the \u201cComputation of Taxable Income\u201d, not in Division B: \u201cComputation of Income\u201d.\nWhen the Act was originally adopted in 1948 with the definition in its present form, there was in Division B a provision (repealed in 1952) that might be considered as defining the extent to which a loss could be deducted in the year in which it was sustained. This was s. 13 of which subs. 1 read:\n(1) The income of a person for a taxation year shall be deemed to be not less than his income for the year from his chief source of income.\nThe effect of that provision was that whenever a loss was incurred in a business that was not the taxpayer\u2019s chief source of income, it could not be deducted from income from that source. This might be said to imply that it could be deducted from other income, because, if as a general rule, a loss from one source could not be deducted from income from any other source in the same year, there would never have been any reason for enacting any rule to limit such deductions in respect of the taxpayer\u2019s chief source of income.\nSection 13(1) as enacted in 1948, was substantially to the same effect as s. 10 of the Income War Tax Act when replaced by the new Act. This may be of some importance when comparing the wording of the \u201cgeneral rules\u201d of the present Act in Division B \u201cComputation of Income\u201d with the corresponding provisions of the former Act. In the latter, \u201cincome\u201d was defined as meaning \u201cthe annual net profit or gain or gratuity,\u2026\u201d. The word \u201cnet\u201d was there from the outset and was obviously considered as implying the right to deduct any expenses or losses incurred in the year because Parliament in 1919, besides making other changes, added to the definition of \u201cincome\u201d the following paragraphs (9-10 George V, c. 55, s. 2):\n(e) in determining the income no deduction shall be allowed in respect of personal and living expenses, and in cases in which personal and living expenses form part of the profit, gain or remuneration of the taxpayer, the same shall be assessed as income for the purposes of this Act;\n(f) deficits or losses sustained in transactions entered into for profit but not connected with the chief business, trade, profession or occupation of the taxpayer shall not be deducted from income derived from the chief business, trade, profession or occupation of the taxpayer in determining his taxable income.\nThe above para. (f) was amended the following year to provide for conclusive determination by the Minister and, in 1923, was replaced by a new provision stating that \u201cthe income of a taxpayer shall be deemed to be not less than the income derived from his chief position, occupation, trade, business or calling\u201d. In the 1927 revision this became s. 10. Despite the change of wording no doubt effected for the purpose of plugging loopholes, the purpose of the provision clearly remained to prohibit the deduction of business losses from income derived from the taxpayer\u2019s chief occupation while leaving intact the right to deduct them from income from any other sources by virtue of the general rule that net income only was taxed. However, and this might be said to be the main basis of respondent\u2019s argument, the present Act no longer defines \u201cincome\u201d as \u201cnet income\u201d. The basic provisions are now the following:\n2. (3) The taxable income of a taxpayer for a taxation year is his income for the year minus the deductions permitted by Division C.\n3. The income of a taxpayer for a taxation year for the purposes of this Part is his income for the year from all sources inside or outside Canada and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, includes income for the year from all\n(a) businesses,\n(b) property, and\n(c) offices and employments.\n4. Subject to the other provisions of this Part, income for a taxation year from a business or property is the profit therefrom for the year.\n5. (1) Income for a taxation year from an office or employment is the salary, wages and other remuneration, including gratuities, received by the taxpayer in the year plus\u2026\n* * *\nminus the deductions permitted by paragraphs (i), (ib), (q) and (qa) of subsection (1) of section 11 and by subsections (5) to (11), inclusive, of section 11 but without any other deductions whatsoever.\nConcerning business losses the difficulty is that, as we have seen, the only provision for their deduction is para. (e) of s. 27(1) in Division C. This, as already noted, does not provide for such deduction in the year in which they are suffered. Section 4 defining income from a business or property as \u201cthe profit therefrom\u201d would appear to negate the consideration of losses. Also the definition of \u201closs\u201d requiring the application of the provisions \u201crespecting computation of income from a business mutatis mutandis\u201d implies that \u201cincome\u201d in the \u201cgeneral rules\u201d does not include a loss.\nOn the other hand, the result of such literal reading of ss. 2, 3, 4 and 5 would be that what is contemplated in the last part of the definition of \u201closs\u201d would never arise. A loss would never operate to reduce the taxpayer\u2019s income from other sources for purposes of income tax for the year in which it is sustained if s. 3 contemplates only the addition of income from every source this being taken in the case of a \u201cbusiness\u201d as meaning a profit not a loss. The difficulty is that such a construction deprives the last part of the definition of \u201closs\u201d of any meaning.\nIt must also be considered that when ss. 2, 3 and 4 were enacted in 1948, the Act included besides the definition of \u201closs\u201d a s. 13 which would have had no effect unless, as a general rule, business losses were deductible from other income in the same year. This provision was repealed in 1952 (1 Eliz. II, c. 29, s. 4). However, according to Maxwell (On Interpretation of Statutes, 11th ed., p. 37):\nWhere a part of an Act has been repealed, it may, although not of operative force, still be taken into consideration in construing the rest, for it is part of the history of the new Act.\nBut, how do we know that the provision was not repealed because it was considered useless?\nOne must also consider that under s. 27(1)(e) as amended in 1958 (c. 32, s. 12), business losses sustained in the five preceding years or in the immediately following year are now deductible not only from the income from the same business but from the income from any other business as well. It would be an extreme anomaly if they were not deductible from the income from another business in the same year, but such is the result if ss. 3 and 4 are read literally as requiring an addition of income from every source without deducting any loss.\nOn this literal construction, another equally anomalous result would follow from the definition of \u201cearned income\u201d (s. 32(5)) as it now stands. Despite its length, I find it necessary to quote it in full.\n(5) For the purpose of this section, \u201cearned income\u201d means the aggregate of\n(a) salary or wages, superannuation or pension benefits, retiring allowances, death benefits, royalties in respect of a work or invention of which the taxpayer was the author or inventor, amounts included in computing the income of the taxpayer by virtue of paragraph (d), (da) or (db) of subsection (1) of section 6, amounts allocated to the taxpayer by a trustee under an employees profit sharing plan, amounts received by the taxpayer from a trustee under a supplementary unemployment benefit plan, amounts included in computing the income of the taxpayer by virtue of section 79B and amounts included in computing the income of the taxpayer by virtue of subsections (9) and (14) of section 79c,\n(b) income from the carrying on of a business either alone or as a partner actively engaged in the business, and\n(c) rental income from real property,\nminus\n(d) business losses sustained in the taxation year in the course of the carrying on of a business either alone or as a partner actively engaged in the business, (da) losses sustained in the taxation year from the rental of real property, and\n(e) amounts deductible under paragraph (u) or (v) of subsection (1) of section 11 or under section 79B in computing income for the taxation year.\nThe above provision clearly indicates that for the purpose of the definition of \u201cearned income\u201d business losses are deductible from what might be described as all income other than investment income in the year in which they are suffered, but not in subsequent or preceding years although they may be deductible from business income in such years. While it is very hard to see how Parliament can possibly have intended that business losses should be deducted in the same year for ascertaining what is \u201cearned income\u201d and not for ascertaining what is \u201cincome\u201d, one must bear in mind that the paramount duty of the Courts is to construe the legislation as written and not to depart from the clear wording because the result of the literal construction appears illogical or unfair. Here, if we compare, as we must, the provisions of s. 32(5) with those of ss. 3, 4 and 5, we find not only an explicit provision for an algebraic addition, plusses and minusses being specified, but also a reference not to income only but to losses as well. A comparison of the language thus appears to indicate a deliberate different intention. It must be noted that this difference arises essentially from an amendment enacted in 1957 (5-6 Eliz. II, c. 29, s. 9). In the Act as adopted in 1948, subs. (5) of s. 31 read:\n(5) For the purpose of this section, \u201cearned income\u201d means\n(a) salary or wages, superannuation or pension benefits, retiring allowances and royalties in respect of a work or invention of which the taxpayer was the author or inventor, and\n(b) income from the carrying on of a business either alone or as a partner actively engaged in the business.\nOne must now turn to the last part of subs. (1) of s. 5, being the definition of \u201cincome from an office or employment\u201d. While s. 4 does not specify the deductions that may be made in ascertaining the income from a business or property, s. 5, after enumerating all the items to be included in income from an office or employment, expressly limits the allowable deductions to those contemplated in a few specifically enumerated provisions of the Act. Can this mean that the other deductions, although they are thus disallowed from income from an office or employment, are nevertheless allowable from total income even if there is no other income, or if all other income amounts to less than those deductions? Would this not deprive the restriction of any practical effect due to the repeal of s. 13(1)? It does not seem that this repeal was intended to have that result because not only was the limitation of the deductions allowable against employment income left intact at that time, but it was reenacted in amended form in 1957 (5-6 Eliz. II, c. 29, s. 1). Parliament having decreed that income from an office or employment shall include all the items specified minus the permitted deductions \u201cbut without any other deductions whatsoever\u201d, it is not easy to see on what basis some other deductions, namely business losses incurred in the same year, should be allowed to reduce the income of a taxpayer below the amount of his income from an office or employment.\nOn the other hand, the limitation of deductions from \u201cincome from an office or employment\u201d is only in the definition of such income (s. 5) and does not affect the definition of \u201cincome\u201d (s. 3). Can it be held to exclude the deduction of business losses incurred in the same year unless it is also held that the latter definition does not implicitly provide for that particular deduction being made? If it is so, then there is no basis anywhere in the Act as it now reads for allowing the deduction of a business loss from income from any other source in the same year as is expressly contemplated in the definition of \u201closs\u201d (s. 139(1)(x)). Should it be said that this merely means that this part of the definition was made useless by the repeal of the former s. 13(1) in 1952? Nothing indicates that this amendment was intended to prohibit the deduction of any business loss in the same year.\nBoth parties seek to avoid the difficulty by calling this a \u201cnetting out\u201d instead of a deduction.\nRespondent contends that the plural \u201cbusinesses\u201d in s. 3 implies a \u201cnetting out\u201d of the income from all businesses in the same year. This argument is self-defeating because, if the plural does of itself carry such an implication, then this must be applied to \u201csources\u201d as well, resulting in an overall \u201cnetting out\u201d that is the very basis of the Minister\u2019s contention.\nOn the other hand, some very serious objections to any \u201cnetting out\u201d theory are not only that the word \u201cnet\u201d was eliminated from the Act in the 1948 revision but also that, in the Act generally, \u201cdeduction\u201d appears to cover anything that may be subtracted. Moreover, the word \u201closs\u201d is found in s. 12 dealing with deductions that are not to be made.\n12.(1) In computing income, no deduction shall be made in respect of\n* * *\n(b) an outlay, loss or replacement of capital, a payment on account of capital or an allowance in respect of depreciation, obsolescence or depletion except as expressly permitted by this Part,\nThis might be said to imply that a loss that is not a loss of capital is, as a rule, deductible. But, if this is a \u201cdeduction\u201d, how can it escape the effect of the limitation of deductions against \u201cincome from an office or employment\u201d?\nHaving thus stated at length the problem presented in argument by the parties, I find however that it does not require to be solved in the instant case because there is no appeal from respondent\u2019s assessment for the year 1962\u00bb It is for that year that the question really arose whether, for income tax purposes, the business loss suffered in that year was to be applied first against other income in that same year. Although the assessment notice for the year 1962 is not in the record, the transcript shows that while respondent was testifying in the Exchequer Court, his counsel said:\nMR. ESTEY:\nThen, I believe, My Lord, part of the record already before Your Lordship includes the three assessment notices which followed that sequence of correspondence. There are three in all which perhaps would be helpful to the Court to mention for a moment now. The first one is 1961 on which is endorsed, after the arithmetic is sorted out\u2014and there is no contest on the arithmetic\u2014\u201cAs per amended return filed with the exception of 1962 business loss, 1962 business loan has previously been allowed as a deduction from other income in 1962\u201d. So the issue for 1961 is narrowed down to whether or not the loss which the taxpayer seeks to apply against that year has already been used up in 1962. And then on the \u201962 assessment, notice of assessment, is endorsed: \u201cYour loss from business in 1962 must first be applied against any other income of the year in which the loss occurs, and accordingly it has been deducted in 1962 and your amended 1961 return will have no effect.\u201d And the third one is for 1963 which again, after dealing with the other matters of arithmetic, it adds in the $9,897.30 with this note: \u201cTaxable income as previously assessed as payments received from Borden, Elliott deemed income $9,897.30.\u201d I take it it is not necessary to file those as exhibits, My Lord?\nto which His Lordship replied: \u201cNo.\u201d Thus it appears that in making up respondent\u2019s assessment for the year 1962, the Minister applied the business loss suffered in that year against other income in that same year. Respondent\u2019s return, which is in the record, shows how this was done and also reveals that there was other income in that year in an amount exceeding the business loss and all other allowable deductions. As there is no appeal from that assessment, the courts cannot revise it. It follows that they cannot consider whether the Minister was correct in applying the business loss, as he did, against other income in that year. That is a question that arose on respondent\u2019s assessment for the year 1962 and was properly determined on that assessment. That determination is binding on the parties. Section 46(7) reads:\n(7) An assessment shall, subject to being varied or vacated on an objection or appeal under this Part and subject to a re-assessment, be deemed to be valid and binding notwithstanding any error, defect or omission therein or in any proceeding under this Act relating thereto.\nIt is only by an objection made in proper time and an appeal, if necessary, that the respondent could prevent his 1962 business loss from operating to reduce his other income in that year by virtue of the assessment. As this was not done, the result is that, having to consider only the assessment for the year 1961, the statutory definition of loss is to be applied to the facts as they are. These are that the whole amount of the 1962 business loss has operated to reduce the taxpayer\u2019s income from other sources for purposes of income tax for the year in which it was sustained and, therefore, it is not available as a deduction in the previous year.\nI must add that s. 46(7) was not referred to in argument written or oral and I would consider a rehearing necessary on that point before such could properly be the basis of the majority decision on this branch of the case.\nFor the year 1963 the facts are the following. The partnership known as Borden, Elliott, Kelley & Palmer was, at the material time, governed by an agreement made as of January 1, 1961. Clause 1 of this contract states that the partnership is a continuation of the partnership heretofore carried under the same firm name and shall continue until determined by the affirmative vote of 75 per cent of the total votes exercisable. There are elaborate provisions for establishing yearly the percentage of the profits to which each partner is to be entitled. It must be noted that two of them are entitled to fix their own share without any restriction and also to exercise this right upon a dissolution with respect to all assets remaining after discharging any liabilities. In respect of withdrawals from partnership, clause 14 provides:\n14. In the event of the withdrawal from partnership or death of any partner, the withdrawing partner or the estate of a deceased partner, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive, not later than six (6) months following the date of such withdrawal or death, the amount of undrawn profits from years preceding the year of withdrawal or death then standing to the credit of such partner.\nThe withdrawing partner or the estate of a deceased partner shall also be paid the following additional amounts,\u2014\n(a) In respect of the financial year (hereinafter in this sub-paragraph (a) called the \u201ccurrent financial year\u201d) in which death or withdrawal occurred, such portion of the profits for that year as shall be voted to the withdrawing partner or to the estate of the deceased partner at the ballot conducted pursuant to sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 12 by the partners then entitled to vote. The withdrawing partner or the personal representatives of the deceased partner shall not be entitled to vote on such ballot but the name of the withdrawing or deceased partner shall appear on the ballot; provided that the withdrawing partner or the estate of the deceased partner shall be entitled to receive from the profits for the current financial year not less than an amount which shall be the average of his percentage rates of profit participation for the three (3) preceding financial years applied to the profits in which the withdrawing or deceased partner would have been entitled to share but for his withdrawal or death of the current financial year and prorated to the period from the commencement of such current financial year to the date of withdrawal or death. The amount so voted to such partner or the aforesaid minimum whichever may be the greater, after deduction of sums paid on account as monthly drawings to the withdrawing partner, or to the deceased partner and his estate, as the case may be, shall be paid in full at once; and pending the determination of the actual amount so payable there shall be paid on account thereof each month during the balance of the current year an amount equal to his last effective monthly drawing rate, and any necessary adjustment shall be made when the actual amount so payable is determined; and\n(b) The Management Committee shall examine into and, in the exercise of its best judgment, evaluate the profits accruing or to accrue or likely to accrue to the partnership from work in process or in contemplation on which the withdrawing or deceased partner was engaged or in respect of which he had general supervision or which he had introduced to the partnership and shall allocate to the withdrawing or deceased partner such portion of those profits as they, in their sole and unrestricted discretion shall consider to be just and equitable; provided, however, that unless the Management Committee shall, by the affirmative vote of 90% of the total votes exercisable in accordance with clauses (d) and (f) of paragraph 11 of this agreement (excluding for the purpose of such vote the votes of the withdrawing partner), have determined that the withdrawing partner or the deceased partner has by his misconduct or dishonesty caused actual loss or damage to the partnership or prejudiced its reputation with the public or clients or the profession, the amount so allocated shall not be less than an amount calculated as follows:\u2014\nThe average of the percentage rates of profit-participation awarded to the withdrawing or deceased partner during the three (3) financial years of the partnership last completed on or before the date of his withdrawal or death shall be calculated. The average percentage rate so obtained shall be applied to the amount of the profits of the partnership, in which the withdrawing or deceased partner would have been entitled to share but for his withdrawal or death, for the financial year of the partnership next following that in which the withdrawal or death occurred and the amount so obtained shall be the minimum entitlement of such partner under this sub-paragraph (b).\nSuch allocation shall be final and binding on all persons in interest and shall not be subject to review in any court. The profits so allocated under this sub-paragraph (b) to a withdrawing or deceased partner shall be paid in full at once or in equal annual instalments over such period of time not exceeding five years from the date on which such withdrawal or death occurred as the Management Committee shall, in its discretion, consider appropriate. There shall, however, be paid to the estate of a deceased partner, on account of the profits to be so allocated, a sum equal to the income tax payable by the estate in respect of the said profits, and such sum shall be paid forthwith upon the ascertainment of the amount of such tax. In no event shall interest be payable on any deferred balance.\nSome time after respondent\u2019s withdrawal from the firm, the Management Committee made a decision under para. (b) of the above clause. The decision allocated to the respondent an amount calculated on the minimum basis specified and decided that this would be payable in four yearly equal instalments starting in 1963. On April 23, 1963, the auditors of the firm certified in writing \u201cthat the sum of $39,589.20 was credited to the account of Mr. I.G. Wahn as his share of the net profit of the firm for the year ended December 31, 1962\u201d, and on April 26 this was mailed to the respondent with a cheque for $9,897.30 being one quarter of the total credit.\nIn his income tax return for the year 1962, respondent, after setting forth the details of his business loss of $6,902.89 previously referred to and claiming the right to carry it back against his 1961 professional income, added the following note:\nI also received from Borden, Elliott, Kelley & Palmer a cheque for $9,897.30 being one quarter of the amount (which is subject to dispute and adjustment) payable to me under my old partnership agreement with that firm. The proper amount payable is determined by reference to 1962 profits of Borden, Elliott, Kelley & Palmer. I left that firm effective December 31, 1961. Accordingly all such payments are capital not income.\nAlthough, as previously mentioned, the notice of assessment for the year 1962 is not in the record, it is clear that the respondent was not assessed for income tax on his income for the year 1962 in respect of either the whole amount allocated to him by his former firm or the part of this amount that was paid to him in April 1963. What happened was that on August 16, 1965, a notice of reassessment was issued for the taxation year 1963 bearing the following mention:\nADD: payments received from Borden, Elliott, Kelley & Palmer\u2014deemed income\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026$9,897.30\nIn his notice of objection, respondent again raised the contention that this was \u201ca capital payment\u201d. He also urged in alternative that if the payment is considered as income, it should be treated as income for the taxation year 1962 rather than 1963. The objection was overruled by the Minister who said in a notification dated May 31, 1966:\nThe amount of $9,897.30 received by the taxpayer in the 1963 taxation year from Messrs. Borden, Elliott, Kelley and Palmer pursuant to clause 14 of the Agreement dated 1st January, 1961 has been properly taken into account in computing the taxpayer\u2019s income for the 1963 taxation year in accordance with the provisions of sections 3 and 4 and paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section 6 of the Act.\nThe parties took substantially the same position in the notice of appeal to the Income Tax Appeal Board and the reply thereto.\nOn February 15, 1967, the Tax Appeal Board upheld the assessment. Weldon said, after quoting from clause 14(b) of the partnership agreement:\nMy interpretation of sub-paragraph (b) is that it was included in the Partnership Agreement to provide a convenient formula for compensating a withdrawing partner in respect of legal fees which he had earned, in whole or in part, but which were destined to be received by his former firm after his withdrawal therefrom. In that light, the amount of $39,589.20, allocated to the Appellant as aforesaid, was clearly income.\nConcerning respondent\u2019s alternative contention, all that was said is the following:\nSince the above payment of $9,897.30 was properly made to the Appellant by his former partners strictly in accordance with the relevant provision contained in the Partnership Agreement, there is no question, in my view, that the payment does not fall directly within the taxpayer\u2019s 1963 taxation year. That point has been clarified because Mr. Wahn has submitted, in the alternative, that, if the payment of $9,897.30 was found to be income instead of capital, as maintained by him, it should be taxed in his 1962 rather than in his 1963 taxation year.\nThis is found in the reasons for judgment of the Board before the other quoted passage in which reference is made not to the amount paid in 1963 but to the whole amount allocated out of the 1962 profits. This makes it rather difficult to understand the precise basis on which respondent\u2019s alternative contention was rejected by the conclusion confirming the assessment for the year 1963.\nIn the Exchequer Court, Gibson J. said:\nThe payment in 1963 of $9,897.30 (together with the payments of a similar amount in the four years following) was for the release, transfer or surrender of the interest of the appellant in goodwill in the law practice of Borden, Elliott, Kelley and Palmer to the remaining partners, the corollary of purchased goodwill, a capital asset, and also to a small degree for the surrender of all the right, title and interest of the appellant in the other capital assets less his responsibility for the liabilities of this firm, and therefore the receipt of this sum for such by the appellant was not income to him within the meaning of the Income Tax Act.\nHere again I find myself unable to agree with the view taken in the Court below. In order to ascertain the nature of the amount allocated to the respondent out of the profits of the firm from which he had withdrawn, the partnership agreement must be construed as written. It was obviously drawn up with great care and special consideration was given to the fiscal consequences of the provisions for payments to a withdrawing partner or to the estate of a deceased partner. In the latter case it is provided that payment will be made by the firm of \u201ca sum equal to the income tax payable by the estate in respect of the said profits\u201d (viz. the profits so allocated). This shows clearly that it was not the intention that the remaining partners should bear the income tax on the part of the 1962 profits allocated to the respondent. However, such would be the result of treating the amount as a capital payment. Respondent would be getting it free from income tax but the amount allocated to him out of the 1962 profits would be added to the share of the remaining partners because, on the assumption that the sum allocated is a capital payment, the whole amount of the 1962 profits would have to be apportioned among the partners instead of the portion remaining after deducting the amount allocated to the respondent. This is clearly what was never intended and I fail to see on what basis the agreement should be given an effect other than that which was undoubtedly intended.\nIt is contended that what is said in the agreement respecting income tax cannot override the provisions of the Act. This is quite true but does not mean that what is said is not to be taken as expressing the intention of the parties. I find it obvious that the intention was that the payment to a withdrawing partner should be an allocation of profits. It is true that the fact that a payment is measured by reference to profits may not prevent it from being of a capital nature but there must be something to show that such is the true nature of a payment. In the present case, I can find nothing tending to indicate that it is so. On the contrary, clause 18 provides clearly that a withdrawing partner has no interest in the capital assets of the firm.\n18. The amounts hereinbefore provided to be paid to a withdrawing, retiring or expelled partner or to the estate of a deceased partner shall be accepted by the withdrawing, retiring or expelled partner or by the estate of the deceased partner in full satisfaction of all claims or demands which he or it may have against the partnership.\nIt must also be noted that when respondent was admitted to the partnership, he was not required to make and did not make, at that time or at any other time, any contribution to capital account. Under such circumstances it is only natural that the agreement was not intended to compel the other partners to pay a substantial capital sum for the privilege of retaining assets to which respondent had not contributed. Concerning goodwill, it is significant that the agreement contains no provision intended to secure it to the remaining partners as against a withdrawing partner although such provision is made for the case when a partner retires because of age or ill health. In such case, clause 17 of the agreement provides for a retiring allowance subject to the condition that he shall not \u201cin any way compete with the continuing partnership\u201d. It is thus clear that the matter of goodwill was considered in the drafting of the partnership agreement. The wording of the provision for the allowance to a withdrawing partner shows that it was not intended to be a capital payment for goodwill but an allocation of profits and this is conclusive evidence that it is income of the recipient as was held by this Court in Minister of National Revenue v. Sedgwick[5].\nMuch was said of the Partnerships Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 288, but I can find nothing in it which would compel us to hold that the amount allocated to the respondent is anything else than what the agreement intends it to be, namely a share of the 1962 profits. Sections 32 and 33 clearly show that it may be lawfully stipulated that a partnership will continue after the withdrawal of a partner and s. 43 implies that payments to a withdrawing partner may be governed by the stipulations of the partnership agreement.\nHaving come to the conclusion that the amount allocated to the respondent by his former firm is not a capital payment but a part of the profits of that partnership in the year 1962, being the year following his withdrawal, it is necessary to consider s. 6 of the Act and especially para. (c). This section down to that paragraph reads as follows:\n6. (1) Without restricting the generality of section 3, there shall be included in computing the income of a taxpayer for a taxation year\n(a) amounts received in the year as, on account or in lieu of payment of, or in satisfaction of\n(i) dividends,\n(ii) director\u2019s or other fees,\n(iii) Repealed. 1963, c. 21, s. 2(1).\n(iv) superannuation or pension benefits,\n(v) retiring allowances, or\n(vi) death benefit;\n(aa) amounts received in the year as annuity payments;\n(b) amounts received in the year or receivable in the year (depending upon the method regularly followed by the taxpayer in computing his profit) as interest or on account or in lieu of payment of, or in satisfaction of interest;\n(c) the taxpayer\u2019s income from a partnership or syndicate for the year whether or not he has withdrawn it during the year;\nThese provisions must be considered in the light of s. 15 of which subs. (1) reads as follows:\n15. (1) Where a person is a partner or an individual is a proprietor of a business, his income from the partnership or business for a taxation year shall be deemed to be his income from the partnership or business for the fiscal period or periods that ended in the year. It is clear that the last quoted provision cannot be applied to the respondent. He was not a partner of his former firm in the year 1962. In my view, this provision should also be taken as defining what is meant as the taxpayer\u2019s income from a partnership in para. (c) of s. 6(1). The Shorter Oxford Dictionary gives the following as the first two meanings of the word \u201cpartnership\u201d:\n1. The fact or condition of being a partner.\n2. Comm. An association of two or more persons for the carrying on of a business, of which they share the expenses, profit, and loss.\nIn the first and stricter sense the payment made to the respondent in 1963 was not income from a partnership because he was not a partner, although in the second and wider sense it might be said to be income from the partnership because it came from the association of which he had formerly been a member. Bearing in mind 1\u00b0 that fiscal statutes must be construed strictly, 2\u00b0 that the respondent having regularly followed the method of reporting his income as received, para. (c) is an exception to the more general rule, 3\u00b0 that the narrow sense is the only one consistent with s. 15(1), I have reached the conclusion that the respondent was properly assessed for the payment made by his former firm in the year in which he actually received it.\nFor the above reasons I am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs, that the judgment of the Exchequer Court should be reversed, that respondent\u2019s appeal to that Court from the decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board should be dismissed with costs and that the said decision should be re-established and confirmed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D.S.

Under the contract, the goods were paid for in advance but not delivered. Some of them were not in existence at the time of the contract. In subsequent weeks some of the goods were delivered but when the winding-up order was made against C Co., a substantial quantity remained to be shipped. The liquidators invited tenders for the purchase of all the stock in trade of C Co. and accepted the tender of the respondent S Co. The petitioner filed a petition asking that it be declared owner of the goods of which it had not received delivery. The liquidators did not contest the petition. S Co. intervened and claimed ownership of the disputed goods. The trial judge granted the petition, but his decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal. The petitioner appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nSince the goods had not been identified before the liquidation pursuant to art. 1474 of the Civil Code, the petitioner had only a pecuniary claim against the assets of C Co. and not a right in rem to the goods over which it claimed ownership.\nVente\u2014Achat de conserves alimentaires\u2014Marchandises pay\u00e9es d\u2019avance mais non livr\u00e9es\u2014Marchandises non pes\u00e9es, ni compt\u00e9es ni mesur\u00e9es avant la mise en liquidation du vendeur\u2014Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 non transf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur\u2014Vente du fonds de commerce par les liquidateurs\u2014Acheteur a seulement un droit de cr\u00e9ance contre la masse\u2014Code Civil, art. 1474. En 1963, la requ\u00e9rante a achet\u00e9 de la compagnie C, qui fut subs\u00e9quemment mise en liquidation, une grande quantit\u00e9 de conserves alimentaires. En vertu du contrat, les marchandises \u00e9taient pay\u00e9es d\u2019avance mais non livr\u00e9es. Certaines de ces marchandises n\u2019existaient pas au moment du contrat. Une certaine quantit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9e durant les semaines subs\u00e9quentes, mais lorsque la compagnie C a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en liquidation une grande quantit\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 exp\u00e9di\u00e9e. Des soumissions furent demand\u00e9es par les liquidateurs pour l\u2019achat du fonds de commerce de la compagnie C, et celle de la compagnie S fut accept\u00e9e. La requ\u00e9rante a produit une requ\u00eate demandant d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e propri\u00e9taire des marchandises dont elle n\u2019avait pas encore re\u00e7u livraison.

Le juge au proc\u00e8s a accueilli la requ\u00eate, mais sa d\u00e9cision fut renvers\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Montpetit J. Appeal dismissed.\nJules Dupr\u00e9, Q.C., for the petitioner, appellant.\nR.S. Litvack, for the intervenant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014In August 1963, appellant contracted to purchase a substantial quantity of canned vegetables from Conserverie St-Denis Lt\u00e9e, (against which a Winding-Up Order was subsequently made and which is hereinafter referred to as the Insolvent). The contract was of a nature known in the trade, apparently, as G.I.N.D., \u201cgoods invoiced and not delivered\u201d. The merchandise was paid for in advance, but not delivered. Some of it was not in existence at the time the contract was made.\nIn subsequent weeks, some of the merchandise was delivered but, as at October 26, 1963, some 9,541 cases of assorted vegetables remained to be shipped. Shortly thereafter a fire occurred at the premises of the insolvent and, on November 8, 1963, the latter wrote appellant, confirming the undelivered quantities and informing appellant that its merchandise had been destroyed.\nOn December 23, 1963, solicitors for appellant wrote the insolvent stating that, in view of the nature of the sale, title had not passed to appellant and, accordingly, any loss suffered as a result of the fire was to be borne by the insolvent. This letter contained the following statement:\n\u2026Ces marchandises ne sont donc pas, jusqu\u2019au moment de leur livraison, sp\u00e9cifiquement d\u00e9sign\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de nos clients et celles que vous pr\u00e9tendez avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truites dans l\u2019incendie\u2014car il apparait qu\u2019une quantit\u00e9 consid\u00e9rable de ces marchandises a \u00e9chapp\u00e9 au sinistre\u2014ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement les marchandises de nos clients. Dans un genre de vente comme celle-ci, la marchandise ne devient individualis\u00e9e qu\u2019au moment de la livraison et la garde et les soins de d\u00e9tention de ces marchandises sont enti\u00e8rement l\u2019objet de votre responsabilit\u00e9. Nos clients, en effet, ne sont pas appel\u00e9s \u00e0 payer de frais d\u2019entreposage pour ces marchandises, parce que, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la marchandise n\u2019est pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9e ou remis\u00e9e en leur nom dans un endroit sp\u00e9cifique, comme la chose se rencontre dans les entrep\u00f4ts publics.\nIn February 1964, appellant instituted an action against the insolvent before the Superior Court, asking for judgment ordering the latter to deliver the balance of the merchandise purchased, or, in the event of the insolvent\u2019s failure so to do, condemning it in the sum of $28,707.98. The action was accompanied by a conservatory attachment in virtue of which, assorted merchandise found by the bailiff at the premises of the insolvent, was placed under seizure, but the goods in issue here were not at that time identified by the bailiff.\nThe insolvent pleaded to the action, but subsequently confessed judgment and, on June 1, 1964, judgment was rendered declaring the conservatory attachment good and valid, ordering the insolvent to deliver the merchandise \u00abjusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence des quantit\u00e9s et qualit\u00e9s d\u00e9crites dans le bref\u00bb, in default of which, the insolvent was condemned to pay to appellant the sum of $28,707.98, with interest and costs.\nHowever, no further deliveries were made to appellant, and on August 20, 1964, a winding-up order was issued against the insolvent. By judgment of the Superior Court, the mis-en-cause were subsequently appointed joint liquidators. On or about September 14, 1964, appellant filed with the liquidators proof of claim, as an unsecured creditor, in the amount of $28,707.98 plus interest, in accordance with the terms of the judgment of June 1, 1964 above referred to.\nSubsequently, the liquidators invited tenders for the purchase of all the stock in trade of the insolvent, and the tender of the respondent, for a total price of $226,000, was accepted, subject to the following condition:\n\u2026In the event that it is subsequently established that any other party or parties have a right in the said merchandise, or in any part thereof, then, and to such extent, the purchase price hereinabove mentioned shall be proportionally reduced.\nDelivery of this stock in trade was made from time to time to respondent by the liquidators following an inventory completed on December 8, 1964.\nOn February 5, 1965, appellant filed a petition, which initiated the present litigation, asking that it be declared owner of the specified quantity of canned vegetables above referred to. The liquidators did not contest the petition, but submitted to justice. The respondent intervened and claimed ownership of the merchandise in question under its contract with the liquidators. Appellant\u2019s petition was granted by the learned trial judge, but that judgment was unanimously reversed by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench[2].\nThe facts which I have recited are set out somewhat more fully, in the reasons of Taschereau J., who delivered the unanimous judgment in the Court below. They are not now really in dispute.\nThe issue here, as in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, was stated concisely by Taschereau J. as follows:\nIl s\u2019agit donc pour cette Cour de d\u00e9cider si, par l\u2019application de l\u2019article 1474 c.c., les marchandises r\u00e9clam\u00e9es par la requ\u00e9rante ont \u00e9t\u00e9 compt\u00e9es, pes\u00e9es ou mesur\u00e9es et ainsi identifi\u00e9es avant la mise en liquidation de la d\u00e9bitrice, ce qui lui donnerait sur icelles un droit r\u00e9el opposable \u00e0 tout le monde, d\u00e8s lors \u00e0 l\u2019intervenante. Dans le cas contraire, la requ\u00e9rante n\u2019aurait qu\u2019un droit personnel qui n\u2019existerait qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la d\u00e9bitrice et ne pourrait \u00eatre oppos\u00e9 aux tiers.\nAfter discussing the authorities, and referring to certain evidence as to identification of the goods, he said:\nJ\u2019en conclus que les diverses quantit\u00e9s de conserves alimentaires qui font l\u2019objet du pr\u00e9sent litige n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9es avant la faillite, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 1474 c.c., et que, d\u00e8s lors, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a qu\u2019un droit de cr\u00e9ance contre la masse et non un droit r\u00e9el sur les marchandises dont elle revendique la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. C\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs ainsi qu\u2019elle a compris la chose, car autrement elle n\u2019aurait jamais \u00e9crit la lettre du 23 d\u00e9cembre 1963 et son action du 7 f\u00e9vrier 1964 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019une saisie revendication et non pas d\u2019une saisie conservatoire.\nI am in agreement with those findings, I am content to adopt them, and I do not find it necessary to add anything to what the learned judge has said.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the petitioner, appellant: Duranleau, Dupr\u00e9 & Gagnon, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the intervenant, respondent: Chait, Arono-vitch, Salomon, Gelber & Bronstein, Montreal.\n[1] [1968] Que.

Appel rejet\u00e9. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, affirming an order of prohibition. Appeal dismissed.\nE.G. Hachborn, for the appellant.\nM. Robb, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2], dated June 12, 1967, affirming an order of Stewart J., dated November 1, 1966, prohibiting Raymond G. Gill, Esq., Justice of the Peace, or any other Justice of the Peace from proceeding further with an Information sworn on the 17th day of December, 1965, charging the respondent\nthat she did while driving a vehicle license No. 103020, at 10:40 A.M., upon entering the intersection of Lawrence Ave. W., and Kimbark Blvd., from Kimbark Blvd., the first named being a highway with a stop sign at the entrance thereto, fail to yield the right of way to traffic approaching the said intersection on Lawrence Ave., W., so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard, as required by Sec. 64(b) of the Highway Traffic Act.\nThe appeal is brought pursuant to an order of this Court[3] made on October 26, 1967, granting the appellant leave to appeal on the following question of law:\nWhether the Court of Appeal for Ontario erred in law in holding that a rubber-stamped signature on an Information of a Justice of the Peace acting as a Commissioner for taking Oaths on an Information rendered such Information a nullity.\nAt the hearing of the application for leave counsel for the respondent had submitted that the Court did not have jurisdiction to grant leave and, in giving leave, the Court stated that it should be left to the Court hearing the appeal to determine the question whether we have jurisdiction to grant leave and, if this should be decided in the affirmative, to deal with the merits.\nSo far as the question of our jurisdiction is concerned, for the purposes of the present appeal it is necessary to decide only whether this Court has jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the Order of Prohibition made by Stewart J. and to entertain that appeal on the merits, and all members of the Court are in agreement that we have this jurisdiction under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act.\nOn the merits of the appeal I find myself so fully in agreement with the reasons of McGillivray J.A. who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal that I am content to adopt them and do not find it necessary to add anything to what he has said. This does not imply any expression of opinion respecting the case to which he refers in which a typed or stamped signature was held to be valid.\nI would dismiss the appeal. Pursuant to the terms of the order granting leave to appeal the appellant will pay the costs of the respondent in this Court.\nAppeal dismissed, costs to the respondent.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.C. Bowman, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: M. Robb, Toronto.\nMOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL[4]\nOn October 26, 1967, the following judgment on the application of the Crown for leave to appeal, was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an application, made pursuant to s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act, for leave to appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[5], dated June 12, 1967, dismissing an appeal from an order of Stewart J., dated November 1, 1966, prohibiting Raymond G. Gill, Esq., J.P., from further proceeding with an Information charging the respondent with driving a motor vehicle contrary to s. 64(b) of the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario. The Order of Prohibition was granted on the ground that the signature of the deponent on the Information and also the signature of the Justice of the Peace before whom the Information was sworn, were both affixed with a rubber stamp instead of in the handwriting of those persons.\nCounsel for the applicant informs us that a large number of other cases depend on the result of this case and argues that the judgments below are contrary to the principles of law laid down in Regina v. Fox[6] and Goodman v. J. Eban Ltd.[7] and other authorities. On these grounds we were disposed to grant leave to appeal on terms but counsel for the respondent argued that it has been decided by this Court in Rex v. Paul,[8] which was followed in Fong Sing v. The Queen,[9] that we have no jurisdiction to grant leave as the proceedings below arise out of a charge of an offence other than an indictable offence and the order sought to be appealed is not a judgment acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of such an offence.\nIn reply counsel for the applicant refers to Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v. Attorney General for Ontario[10], Smith v. The Queen[11], particularly at page 642, neither of which appear to have been referred to in the judgments in Paul v. The Queen or Fong Sing v. The Queen, referred to above, and also to the case of Minister of National Revenue et al v. Lafleur[12]. It appears difficult to reconcile these judgments and under all the circumstances it seems to us that the proper course is to grant leave to appeal, leaving it to the Court which hears the appeal to determine the question whether we have jurisdiction to grant leave and, if this is decided in the affirmative, to deal with the merits.\nAs the matter is in the nature of a test case, we think it proper to grant leave subject to the terms that the applicant will pay the costs of the respondent in this Court in any event of the appeal.\nLeave is granted accordingly.\n[1] [1967] 2 O.R. 496, 2 C.R.N.S. 5, [1968] 1 C.C.C.\n[2] [1967] 2 O.R. 496, 2 C.R.N.S. 5, [1968] 1 C.C.C. 1.\n[3] Page 441.\n[4] CORAM: Cartwright C.J. and Judson and Spence JJ.\n[5] [1967] 2 O.R. 496, 2 C.R.N.S. 5, [1968] 1 C.C.C.\n[6] (1958), 120 C.C.C. 289, 27 C.R. 132, [1958] O.W.N. 141.\n[7] [1954] 1 Q.B. 550, [1954] 1 All E.R. 763.\n[8] [1960] S.C.R. 452, 34 C.R. 110, 127 C.C.C. 129.\n[9] [1963] S.C.R. 60, 40 C.R. 195, [1963] 1 C.C.C. 113.\n[10] [1959] S.C.R. 188, 122 C.C.C. 305, 16 D.L.R. 609.\n[11] [1959] S.C.R. 638, 30 C.R. 230, 124 C.C.C. 71, 22 D.L.R.

The subject land was a corner site, immediately contiguous to the university, and it was agreed that its highest and best use, apart from the building thereon, was for the erection of an apartment building. Following a hearing the Ontario Municipal Board fixed the compensation at $160,000. On appeal from the Board\u2019s decision, the Court of Appeal increased the compensation to $202,260. The university appealed and the fraternity cross-appealed from the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nHeld (Judson and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Spence J.: The task of this Court was to determine whether the arbitrator had proceeded on some incorrect principle or overlooked or misapprehended some material evidence of fact and in turn whether the Court of Appeal had done so in its disposition of the issue.\nThe fraternity\u2019s contention that compensation for the subject property should be fixed upon reinstatement value was properly rejected by the Municipal Board and by the Court of Appeal. Generally, the reinstatement standard was applicable only in respect of property for which there was no market or general demand. This could not be said of the property in question.\nThe Municipal Board in its decision considered the evidence of value on two different bases, i.e., replacement and redevelopment. In making his appraisal for redevelopment purposes the university\u2019s valuator had considered properties as comparable which were not comparable and it did not seem that he gave consideration to corner influence and prime location. Therefore, to accept his valuation, as the Municipal Board did, was to arrive at a valuation based on a misapprehension of the effect of the evidence and so was to fail to act in accordance with principle.\nThe Court of Appeal again adopting the value for redevelopment as the highest and best use of the subject property fixed the per square foot valuation at a higher figure than that given by the university\u2019s valuator, but reduced the total appraisal for that purpose by an amount of 1,500 square feet on the basis that the fraternity did not require lands of such area, and then added to the amount of the land value, so adjusted because of what was viewed as oversize, the sum of $30,000 for renovation and reconstruction, and the sum of $1,500 for moving and incidental expenses. The reduction could not be supported, as a developer intending to build an apartment house on the site would have to pay the same amount per square foot for all the lands and would have to buy it all. The addition of an amount for renovation and reconstruction was also an error in principle. A developer would pay only the cost of acquiring the lands and would not pay anything for a building which he intended to remove.\nOn a consideration of the evidence, the value for redevelopment purposes was placed at $194,490, and that for replacement at $210,500. The greater of these two values was the value to which the fraternity was entitled, and with the addition thereto of $1,500 for moving and incidental expenses, the fraternity was entitled to compensation of $212,000.\nPer Ritchie J.: Errors in principle found by Spence J. to have been made by the Board, i.e. (i) failing to appreciate that in this case the overriding consideration in determining \u201cvalue to the owner\u201d was the value which the respondent attached to the maintenance of its fraternity domicile and that the fact that it was deprived of its \u201chome\u201d was an essential and substantial ingredient to be taken into account in determining the loss for which the respondent was entitled to compensation by way of replacement and (ii) accepting a value of $3 per square foot for that part of the respondent\u2019s land that was used as a parking area, afforded a justification for the review made by him. Agreement was expressed with his analysis of the circumstances and with his proposed disposition of the case.\nPer Judson and Pigeon JJ., dissenting: The appeal should be allowed and the valuation of the Municipal Board restored; the cross-appeal should be dismissed. The Court of Appeal had erred in principle in awarding an increase in the square foot valuation, in giving the sum of $30,000 for renovation and reconstruction of any property which the fraternity might purchase as a substitute, and in awarding $1,500 for moving and incidental expenses.\nThe fraternity\u2019s cross-appeal asking for the value of the land for redevelopment purposes between the brackets of $160,000 and $236,000, plus the depreciated reconstruction cost of the building at $103,754.80, would involve the assessment of compensation on the basis of reinstatement. This basis was to be applied only when there was no possible market for the property as used. Evidence before the Board fully justified the finding that there was such a market.\nOn a review of pronouncements of great authority prior to Winnipeg Supply & Fuel Co. Ltd. v. Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg, [1966] S.C.R. 336, the principle upon which the reasons in the deciding opinion in this appeal rested was questioned.\n[Saint John Harbour Bridge Authority v.

Appeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed, Judson and Pigeon JJ. dissenting.\nW.D. Griffiths, Q.C., and J.T. DesBrisay, Q.C., for the appellant.\nW.L.N. Somerville, Q.C., and G. Cihra, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Spence J. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This was an appeal by the University of Toronto from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 pronounced on May 1, 1967, by which judgment the Court of Appeal allowed an appeal from the decision of the Municipal Board pronounced on August 4, 1966. The Board had fixed the compensation allowed to the Zeta Psi Elders Association of Toronto at $160,000. By its decision the Court of Appeal for Ontario had increased that compensation to $202,260.\nThe Elders have cross-appealed from the said judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nThe University of Toronto enacted a by-law on August 6, 1964, which was registered on the next day expropriating the entire holding of the Zeta Psi Elders situated in the City of Toronto and known municipally as 118 St. George Street. Under the provisions of The University Expropriation Powers Act, 1965 (Ont.), c. 135, and The Expropriation Procedures Act, 1962\u201163 (Ont.), c. 43, the compensation was to be fixed by the Ontario Municipal Board. That Board held a hearing over seven days receiving the evidence of many witnesses, particularly three experts on the question of appraisal: James I. Stewart, for the claimant Elders, and Kevin W. Hicks and Robert A. Davis for the respondent the University of Toronto, and after reserving its judgment gave the decision recited aforesaid which was later varied by the Court of Appeal as I have set out.\nBefore proceeding with these reasons, I think it proper to again indicate the function of this Court upon the consider- ation of such an appeal. I had the occasion to point out in Winnipeg Supply & Fuel Co. Ltd. v. Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg[2]:\nSufficient to say that the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to act when the arbitrator has proceeded on some incorrect principle or has overlooked or misapprehended some material evidence of fact.\nand I referred to that passage in the reasons given for the Court in Saint John Harbour Bridge Authority v. J.M. Driscoll Ltd.[3] It would seem, therefore, that the task of this Court is to determine whether the arbitrator had proceeded on some incorrect principle or overlooked or misapprehended some material evidence of fact and in turn whether the Court of Appeal had done so in its disposition of the issue.\nThe Zeta Psi Fraternity had a chapter in Toronto from the year 1879 on. In the year 1911, they had purchased the subject property, an imposing residence built in 1885 on the west side of St. George Street one house north of the intersection of St. George and Harbord Streets. The fraternity occupied those premises for use as a fraternity house from that date until the expropriation in 1964. There had been small renovations or additions through the years but in 1950 the fraternity had considered the demolition of the building on the premises and its replacement with another building or, as an alternative, a move to other premises. The fraternity decided to make a complete renovation and structural alteration of the building on the site at a cost of about $47,000. In the year 1955, the one house to the south and separating the house from Harbord Street had been expropriated by the City of Toronto and demolished and Harbord Street at its easterly end bent north-east so that it ended at St. George Street immediately opposite Hoskin Avenue, the street which runs from St. George Street to Queen\u2019s Park. At this time, the City of Toronto also expropriated a small portion of the lands owned by the fraternity at its south-east corner and conveyed to the fraternity, in return, a small block at the south-west corner of the fraternity\u2019s lands so that thereafter the fraternity had its whole southerly frontage from east to west adjoining Harbord Street. This left the fraternity with a corner property immediately across Harbord Street from the new, very large and imposing university buildings, and diagonally across the intersection of St. George Street and Harbord Street from fairly new and imposing university residences. Looking further east from the subject premises there was an unobstructed view of the entire back campus of the University of Toronto, and in the distance Wycliffe College, a part of Hart House, and at the end of Hoskin Avenue, Queen\u2019s Park. The subject property had been, from the time of its first establishment as a fraternity house, one of the two finest sites in Toronto for a fraternity house. Many years before, its only rival for that distinction, the Kappa Alpha Fraternity house at the north-west corner of Hoskin Avenue and Devonshire Place, had been expropriated by the university, so that from then until the time of the expropriation of the subject premises the Zeta Psi Fraternity house at 118 St. George Street was by far the most advantageous site for a fraternity house in Toronto. Moreover, there is no doubt that the fraternity was an eminent one in that group. The Zeta Psi Fraternity had no intention whatsoever of giving up the subject property, and after the expropriation its only intention was to find other premises as close as possible to the subject premises both in location and standard of amenities and to continue to carry on therein the operation of the fraternity. Since the arbitration, the Elders for the Zeta Psi Fraternity have purchased other premises at 180 St. George Street, one block north of Bloor Street, i.e., exactly three blocks north of the subject property. The transaction not having been closed until after the expropriation hearing before the Municipal Board, the final details thereof could not be presented to the Board. The Court of Appeal for Ontario declined to receive evidence thereon. It is regrettable that the property in the City of Toronto which was most comparable to the subject property could not have been the subject of any detailed study by either the Municipal Board or the Court of Appeal for Ontario. This Court, under the circumstances, could receive no evidence thereon.\nThe Municipal Board, in the lengthy and carefully detailed reasons for its decision, considered the expert evidence given by the many witnesses including those to whom I have referred. It had been the Elders\u2019 contention before the Board, before the Court of Appeal, and in this Court, that the compensation for the subject property should be fixed upon the standard which has been referred to as \u201creinstatement\u201d, and which standard was applied by Thorson P. in The Queen v. Community of the Sisters of Charity of Providence[4]. Cripps on Compulsory Acquisition of Land, 11th ed., at p. 907 ff., discusses the question of reinstatement value pointing out that it is a method of arriving at the value to the owner which, of course, it has been said in a very large number of cases, is the compensation to which the claimant is entitled. At pp. 907-8, the learned author states:\nGenerally it was only given in respect of property which was of such a nature (for example, a school, church, hospital, house of exceptional character, business premises in which the business could only be carried on under special conditions or by means of a special licence) that there was no market or general demand for such property; and a market value deducted from the income derived would not constitute a fair basis in assessing the value to the owner.\n(The italicizing is my own.)\nThis statement, I think, is one which does reflect the jurisprudence upon the subject. Despite the evidence adduced by the University of Toronto as to the statement of the Caput of the University on February 1, 1960, in which it emphasizes the non-official character of the fraternities at the University of Toronto, I would be of the opinion that a fraternity house was within the type of use which would bring its property within the class of those to which reinstatement might apply. I am, however, of the opinion that it cannot apply in the particular case for it cannot be said that as to the subject property there was no market or general demand. In Toronto, a very large number of fraternities maintain chapters and occupy fraternity houses. As I have said, the site of the subject property was, at the time of the expropriation, the pre-eminent site in Toronto for a fraternity house. There was, in my view, a strong demand for that property for use as a fraternity house had the Zeta Psi Fraternity ever determined to move elsewhere or, a most unlikely event, determined to cease the maintenance of a fraternity house in Toronto. I, therefore, as did the Municipal Board and the Court of Appeal for Ontario, need not consider reinstatement value. Moreover, it would appear that a valuation considered on replacement basis in the circumstances of the present case would arrive at the same result as a valuation considered upon reinstatement basis.\nThe Municipal Board in its decision considered the evidence of value given upon two different bases: Firstly, the basis of replacement to which I have already referred and, secondly, the basis of the value of the site for sale for redevelopment purposes. The Municipal Board accepted the evidence of Mr. Hicks, one of the two expert witnesses called by the university whose evidence had been confirmed by Mr. Davis, the other expert called by the university. In such evidence, to which more detailed reference will be made hereafter, Mr. Hicks appraised the value of the subject site for redevelopment purposes at $10.25 a square foot. Since the said premises contain 15,730 square feet, Mr. Hicks rounded out that figure at $160,000. Mr. Hicks, turning to the replacement value, found that the replacement value was only $140,000. He, therefore, concluded and the Board accepted that conclusion and based judgment on it, that the highest and best use of the land was for redevelopment purposes and that the claimant was entitled to the sum of $160,000.\nMr. Stewart, giving evidence on behalf of the claimant, had submitted values far beyond that found by Mr. Hicks. He had appraised the value of the site for redevelopment purposes at $15 a square foot which he rounded out at $236,000. Mr. Stewart\u2019s opinion on the replacement basis was the sum of $284,000.\nIn the Court of Appeal for Ontario, Evans J.A., in his reasons, said:\nMr. Stewart\u2019s evidence suffered from a lack of comparables since in his opinion there was only one suitable comparable while Mr. Hicks used many properties both north and south of Bloor Street and west to Spadina. He does not appear to have given any consideration to the additional value which attaches because of corner influence nor has he, in my opinion, adequately considered the undoubtedly prime location of the subject property. These two factors add a premium to the value of the expropriated land which in my opinion of the evidence should result in a value of $12.00 per square foot as redevelopment land.\nTherefore, the Court of Appeal for Ontario again adopting the value for redevelopment as the highest and best use of the subject property fixed the valuation at $12 per square foot and not $10.25 as had been done by the Municipal Board, but reduced the total appraisal for that purpose by an amount of 1,500 square feet on the basis that the fraternity did not require lands of such an area, and then added to the amount of the land value, so adjusted because of what was viewed as oversize, the sum of $30,000 for renovation and reconstruction, and the sum of $1,500 for moving and incidental expenses. The Court of Appeal for Ontario, therefore, varied the award increasing the sum to the amount of $202,260. The reasons advanced by both tribunals must be considered.\nMr. Hicks recited in his evidence and there was produced as ex. 30 forty sales which he found to be in some degree comparable. These sales were in an area extending north of Bloor Street, well-nigh to Dupont Street, westerly to Walmer Road and Kendal Avenue and easterly almost to Avenue Road. Mr. Stewart had confined his search for comparables to a much narrower area as the fraternity officers had insisted that they could only relocate in an area bounded on the east by Bedford Road, on the north by Lowther Avenue, and on the west by Spadina Road. The University of Toronto had expropriated the subject property in the course of a large expropriation which took in all the property, except some owned by the province, north of Harbord Street to within a few hundred feet of Bloor Street, and westerly toward Spadina Avenue. However, when that extended area is occupied by university buildings, none of the alleged comparable properties will be as close to such extended campus as the subject property is to the present campus nor will any of them occupy a site of such eminence in reference to the university campus. Certainly, it would appear from the evidence and particularly the cross-examination of Mr. Hicks that sites on Walmer Road, on Kendal Avenue, on Bedford Road, and on such streets as Prince Arthur, cannot be considered as in any way comparable to the subject site for either replacement or redevelopment purposes.\nHaving cited these various forty comparables, Mr. Hicks seems to have given a figure based on his opinion but not calculated by an analysis of the comparables of $10.25 a square foot. Evans J.A., in the Court of Appeal for Ontario, noted and, with respect, I think rightly, that such figure had not been one giving sufficient weight to corner influence or to prime location, and increased the valuation to $12 per square foot. Since all agree that the highest and best use of the subject lands, apart from the buildings thereon, would be for the erection of an apartment building, I find an interesting comparison to be the sale of lands for such redevelopment purposes in the immediate neighbourhood. Mr. Hicks had admitted that the subject property not only had the finest location for a fraternity house but that St. George Street was the preferred site for apartment development and, therefore, of course, lands on St. George Street would have the highest value for redevelopment as apartment sites. He also testified that from 1957 to 1964 the price paid for lands for redevelopment in the St. George Street area had increased at the rate of about 6 per cent per year. Therefore, from the comparables cited in ex. 30 by Mr. Hicks, I took the lands on St. George Street as close as possible thereto which were sold for redevelopment purposes. It is necessary to adjust the sales value up or down at the rate of 6 per cent per year in order to arrive at a comparable valuation as of the date of the expropriation herein. There were seven such sales cited in the evidence as follows:\n189-197 St. George Street\nLarge site on St. George Street, midway between Lowther Avenue and Bernard, i.e., 2\u00bd blocks north of Bloor Street.\n157 St. George Street\nNorth-east corner of St. George Street and Lowther Avenue, i.e., 2 blocks north of Bloor Street.\n153 St. George Street\nJust south of 157 St. George Street.\n149 St. George Street\nTwo doors south of 153.\n64 Prince Arthur Avenue\nNorth side of Prince Arthur, east of St. George Street.\nSouth side of Prince Arthur Avenue\nWest of St. George and east of Huron Street.\nNorth side of Prince Arthur Avenue\nMidway between Avenue Road to Bedford.\nI accept the submission made by counsel for the university that 149 St. George Street and 153 St. George Street should be eliminated from this comparison. At an earlier date, the zoning regulations had permitted the construction on a site on St. George Street and in that area of a building three-and-a-half times the square foot area of the site. An amendment of those building regulations by by-law reduced the size of a building which could be constructed on a site to one having a floor space of twice the size of the site. This caught those two other houses on 149 and 153 St. George Street with apartment houses on either side of them. An amendment was enacted permitting the increase in the floor area of these two premises alone to three and one-half times the site area. As a result, they were sold in October 1960 for $14 a square foot and $13.86 a square foot, respectively.\nTaking the other five sales and making the 6 per cent annual allowance of increase or decrease in price in order to arrive at the value for development purposes in August 1964, we find a valuation of $11.45 a square foot. As I have already pointed out, they are all a considerable distance north of the subject site, that is, in August 1964, they were that much further away from the university. The subject property was, at the date of the expropriation, a site immediately contiguous to the university, and it had a very considerable advantage for apartment house development purposes. Had it been possible to erect an apartment house thereon at that date in August 1964, the premises would have been very valuable as prospective housing for faculty. It is the situation in that August 1964 and not the situation after the expropriation which must be considered, but even if we consider the latter situation then the sites which I have indicated above will all be further from the extended campus than the subject site is from the present campus and only one of them was a corner site. I am of the opinion, therefore, that that $11.45 average indicates a value for redevelopment purposes of the subject site in August 1964 of $13 per square foot. This valuation is, in my view, to be preferred to that given by Mr. Hicks because he considered as comparable properties which, in my opinion, are not comparable and because he does not seem to have given consideration to corner influence or prime location although he admitted in cross-examination that the subject site possessed them both. Therefore, to accept Mr. Hicks\u2019 valuation of $10.25 per square foot, as the Municipal Board did, was to arrive at a valuation based on a misapprehension of the effect of the evidence and so was to fail to act in accordance with principle. This $13 per square foot for 15,730 square feet gives a valuation for redevelopment purposes of $194,490. As has been pointed out already, Evans J.A. in the Court of Appeal reduced the amount allowed for redevelopment purposes by deducting from the area of the site for which compensation was being allowed an area of 1,500 square feet, being of the opinion that the subject site was that much larger than the area required for its use as a fraternity house site. With respect, I think this deduction cannot be supported. The valuation for redevelopment purposes is the valuation of all the lands whatever had been their use prior to the expropriation. A redeveloper intending to build an apartment house on the site would have to pay the same amount per square foot for all the lands and would have to buy it all. In fact, the land at the south-west corner would be as valuable as any other portion of the lands because it would permit him to design an apartment building with a garage entrance from Harbord Street to the rear of his building, leaving unmarred by driveways and available for his apartment building the whole of the St. George Street frontage. I would, therefore, have fixed the valuation for redevelopment purposes at the said $194,490. It should be noted that in arriving at the value of $13 per square foot, I have used only the comparables cited by Mr. Hicks in his evidence for the respondent, although not all of them, and have adjusted the values to the date of the expropriation using his evidence alone.\nIt must be noted that that figure does not make any allowance for an amount referred to by Evans J.A. in the Court of Appeal for Ontario as being for renovation and reconstruction.\nIn Saint John Harbour Bridge Authority v. Driscoll, supra, it was said, at pp. 641-2:\nThe value of the buildings at $62,000 had been part of the award made by the Land Compensation Board but it must be remembered that in that award the value of the land was being assessed at the rate of 35\u00a2 per square foot while as I have said the Appeal Division were unanimously of the opinion that it should be fixed at $1 per square foot. It must also be remembered that this latter figure of $1 per square foot represented the opinion of Mr. Corbett as to the value of the land when put to its highest and best use, that is, for a large warehousing or manufacturing enterprise and did not represent the value of the land when used by a small business supplying lumber items to ships. Before any purchaser could utilize the land for that highest and best use, the purchaser would have to remove from the site the considerable number of frame buildings which existed at the time of the expropriation and which had been valuable and efficient for the use for which the owner was putting them at the time of the expropriation.\n* * * Therefore, I am of the view that having adopted the rate of $1 per square foot as the value of the lands, it was an error of principle to add to that amount any valuation of the buildings and that the award of the Appeal Division should be reduced by the sum of $62,000 representing the value of the buildings included in the amount awarded.\nSimilarly, if one is considering the value of the subject site for redevelopment purposes, then the redeveloper must before he can proceed to accomplish his purpose, i.e., the erection of a large apartment house, demolish the building constructed in 1885 which at the time of the expropriation occupied the lands. Salvage from that demolished building would certainly be slight and not cover the cost of demolition. The developer would pay only the cost of acquiring the lands and he would not pay one cent for a building which he intended to remove.\nAs I have said, what must be awarded upon an expropriation is the value to the owner. In Canada the classic statement thereon was given in this Court by Rand J. in Diggon-Hibben Ltd. v. The King[5], at p. 715 as follows:\n...the owner at the moment of expropriation is to be deemed as without title, but all else remaining the same, and the question is what would he, as a prudent man, at the moment, pay for the property rather than be ejected from it.\nThe owner must consider whether he would sell the site for its highest and best use, that is, undoubtedly, development as an apartment site, or whether it is more valuable to him to hold it and continue to use it for its present purposes. As I have said, the Zeta Psi Fraternity had only the intention to continue in the use of the subject site for a fraternity house, and its only intention for the future is to carry on a fraternity house in the best site it could obtain for such purpose. As I have said, this purpose has now been accomplished but unfortunately too late to provide us with the necessary evidence for consideration upon the present appeal.\nWhen the fraternity could not carry on in the subject site, it is entitled to the value of that site to it and that value is, in my opinion, the greater of either the value of that site for redevelopment purposes or the cost of replacing that site with another for the purpose of carrying on a fraternity house. It was with this consideration in view that evidence was given before the Municipal Board with respect to replacement costs. As I have said, the evidence given by the expert for the claimant and that by the experts for the respondent varied startlingly, Mr. Stewart arriving at a valuation of $284,000 when giving evidence for the claimant and Mr. Hicks arriving at a valuation of only $140,000 when giving evidence for the respondent. The Municipal Board rejected the evidence of Mr. Stewart, I think, from a perusal of the reasons given on behalf of the Board, chiefly because he arrived at his result by the use of one comparable only, that was the property at 182 St. George Street. That property had been purchased in the year 1958 by the Delta Upsilon Fraternity when that fraternity had, at that time, been dispossessed of its former premises across Harbord Street, a short distance south of the subject property, by expropriation by the university. With respect, I agree with the view of the Municipal Board that it is not \u00abproper to assess the replacement value of 118 St. George Street by the consideration of one comparable only, i.e., 182 St. George Street. I am, however, of the opinion that if one were to consider the evidence given by Mr. Hicks on behalf of the respondent, one may avail oneself of much more evidence as to comparables and arrive at a result differing considerably from the result at which he arrived. Mr. Hicks approached the replacement value in two different fashions. He, firstly, took his figure of $10.25 per square foot as the value for replacement and then by some calculation which I have not been able to fathom arrived at a valuation for use as a fraternity house of one-half of that amount per square foot rounding it out at $5.25, and then added to the amount so found a depreciated amount for buildings. Mr. Hicks then proceeded to check the result arrived at by this somewhat mysterious procedure, with the sale of about eight buildings in the area for use for other than redevelopment. The purchasers of those buildings did not intend to demolish the buildings but rather to use them after renovation for their purposes. The schedule of those buildings was produced as ex. 29 and it contains nine examples. Two of them lettered in the schedule as \u201cD\u201d and \u201cE\u201d should be disregarded as they would appear to have been truly apartment house sites. One of them, the premises at 651 Spadina Avenue, I would disregard as being far from a comparable. It was a very large building on a large site which had been used as a young ladies\u2019 private school for many decades, thereafter for some other purpose, and is now being used as a Ukrainian students\u2019 residence. The premises, I think, from the point of view of their site on Spadina Avenue below Bloor and from the point of view of building, would be quite impossible to consider as a fraternity house. In the comparables, however, set out as ex. 29, were five properties actually purchased from 1958 on by various fraternities for use as fraternity houses. Those properties were as follows:\n182 St. George Street\nPurchased as I have said by the Delta Upsilon.\n94 Prince Arthur Avenue\nNorth side of Prince Arthur Avenue one block west of St. George Street. Purchased by the Alpha Delta Fraternity.\n407 Huron Street\u2014Purchased by Zeta Delta Association.\n409 Huron Street\u2014Purchased by Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity. East side of Huron Street immediately south of Bloor Street.\n157 St. George Street\nPurchased by Deke Alumni Association. North-east corner of St. George Street and Lowther Avenue.\nMr. Hicks in his evidence gave a careful analysis of all of those properties and gave values per square foot of the buildings on the premises as compared to the building on the subject premises. He concluded his analysis of the site at 182 St. George Street by testifying:\nThis would give an indicated value for 118 St. George, which is seven thousand six hundred and ninety-one square feet [that is the square foot area above the ground floor of the subject premises]\u2026of $18.22 per square foot.\nIf one takes the rounded square foot area of the buildings in the said property as 7,700 square feet and applies thereto the average of Mr. Hicks\u2019 values of the five comparables, i.e., $18.11 per square foot, one arrives at the average valuation of the building and the lands occupied by the fraternity of $139,447. As I have said, this figure is arrived at by considering the sale of other premises for fraternity house occupation as close as possible to the claimant\u2019s present advantageous site, although, as. I have pointed out, all such sites to a considerable degree lack the pre-eminence of the subject site. There is, in addition another factor which must be considered. Those five sites had an average square foot area of land either occupied by the building or used for other purposes or unused of 9,519 square feet. The subject site had an area of 15,730 square feet. There was much evidence and much cross-examination in reference to Mr. Hicks\u2019 evidence that the \u201cextra land\u201d should only be valued at $3 per square foot as this was an alleged valuation of lands used for parking. I am of the opinion that that evidence and any reliance placed upon it in arriving at a result is ill-conceived. What the claimant is entitled to on replacement is replacement of the present premises as close as one may arrive at it. If the claimant has a large property of 15,730 square feet whether or not it did occupy the whole of the old site for its building or whether or not it will occupy in the new premises only 7,700 square feet, it matters not whether that \u201cextra land\u201d is used for parking or for landscaping or for any other purpose. The claimant had it before the expropriation, and if the claimant is entitled to replacement the claimant is entitled to have it again and, failing that, a fair value for it.\nAs I have said, the comparable accommodations used to value the fraternity house and the necessary lands about it would justify a valuation of $139,447. Since those comparable accommodations averaged 9,519 square feet, the claimant is entitled to compensation for what it will not obtain in any of those comparable accommodations, i.e., an additional 6,211 square feet of land. At what amount per square foot should those 6,211 square feet be valued? Again, turning to the properties which had been purchased for use as a fraternity house, I find that four of them had been purchased at an average square foot price for the whole land of $11.44 per square foot. As will be seen, I have eliminated one of the five purchases for the purpose of occupying as a fraternity house; that was a purchase made in 1966, almost two years after the expropriation. It was a purchase of a building at 409 Huron Street which had already undergone an extensive renovation with a large addition at the rear, and I am of the opinion that the purchase of the land site including land and buildings, when the buildings cover such a large percentage of the site and when the buildings included this large new addition, would throw out the value of the land itself. Therefore, eliminating that sale, I find that the average valuation of the lands sold for occupation of the buildings thereon as fraternity houses is the said figure of $11.44 a square foot, and the value therefore of 6,211 square feet of such lands, which is the extent of the \u201cextra land\u201d of the subject site, is $71,053. Adding that amount to the amount of the value for use of the fraternity house and its adjacent lands previously fixed at the amount of $139,447, I arrive at a valuation of the subject site at 118 St. George Street for use as a fraternity house of $210,500.\nThere was allowed in the Court of Appeal for Ontario the sum of $1,500 for moving and incidental expenses. No objection was made to that allowance in argument before this Court. It would seem to be a proper item when the replacement basis of valuation is that accepted and it would seem to be a modest allowance. Adding that sum, therefore, I find that the claimant is entitled to compensation of $212,000. The claimant is entitled to interest on that amount from the date of the expropriation until payment.\nTherefore, I would dismiss the appeal herein and allow the cross-appeal increasing the award to the claimant cross-appellant as I have outlined. The claimant should have its costs in this Court and the amount of $625.80 as allowed in the judgment of the Court of Appeal for the reporting and transcribing of the proceedings as required by the Municipal Board.\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment of my brothers Spence and Pigeon and I would dispose of this case in the manner proposed by my brother Spence.\nI find it necessary, however, to express my views as to the function of this Court on the consideration of such an appeal.\nAs has been pointed out by my brother Spence, the majority of this Court in Winnipeg Supply & Fuel Co. Ltd. v. Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg[6], endorsed the statement that it was \u201cSufficient to say that the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to act when the arbitrator has proceeded on some incorrect principle or has overlooked or misapprehended some material evidence of fact\u201d. I think it desirable to say that the word \u201cmisapprehended\u201d as used in this context should, in my view, be taken as meaning that the arbitrator has made a mistake of fact and that it should not be construed as justifying this Court in reviewing the evidence and substituting its views for that of the arbitrator on the theory that if he was of a different opinion, he must have \u201cmisapprehended some material evidence of fact\u201d.\nAs I read the reasons for judgment of my brother Spence, he appears to me to have found that the Board erred in principle in failing to appreciate that in this case the overriding consideration in determining \u201cvalue to the owner\u201d was the value which the respondent attached to the maintenance of its fraternity domicile and that the fact that it was deprived of its \u201chome\u201d was an essential and substantial ingredient to be taken into account in determining the loss for which the respondent was entitled to compensation by way of replacement.\nI think also that Mr. Justice Spence rightly considered that the Board had erred in principle in accepting a value of $3 per square foot for that part of the respondent\u2019s land that was used as a parking area. I agree that this \u201cextra land\u201d should be valued on the same basis as the land occupied by the building.\nAs I have indicated, I agree with the careful analysis of the circumstances which is contained in the judgment of my brother Spence, and I think that the errors in principle to which I have referred afford a justification for the review which he has made.\nThe judgment of Judson and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by\nPIGEON J. (dissenting):\u2014The property with which we are concerned in this expropriation was a fraternity house at the north-west corner of St. George and Harbord Streets, Toronto. It was a large old house, having been built in 1885. The land area was 15,730 sq. ft. It had been extensively renovated in 1950 at a cost of $47,700, and in 1964, when it was expropriated, it was in need of repairs which would have cost approximately $9,000. In 1955, a portion of the property on the south side had been expropriated by the City of Toronto for a street-widening. At that time the city took 727.1 sq. ft. at $6 per sq. ft., and the fraternity acquired in exchange from the city a parcel containing 2,260 sq. ft., now comprising the south-west corner of the expropriated property, at $4 per sq. ft.\nThe property was expropriated by the university on August 6, 1964. The Ontario Municipal Board, on August 4, 1966, awarded the fraternity $160,000. The Court of Appeal, on May 1, 1967, increased the award to $202,260. Before the Board, the fraternity submitted that the proper basis for compensation was to be determined on the principle of reinstatement. It claimed the market value of the land at $236,000, plus the depreciated replacement cost of its building at $103,750, for a total of $339,750. In the alternative, it claimed an award based on the cost of acquiring and renovating a comparable property together with an allowance for the relative inadequacies of that property as compared with the existing property.\nThe university, on the other hand, urged that the principle of reinstatement did not apply and that the fraternity was entitled only to the market value of the expropriated property when devoted to its highest and best use, which was for redevelopment as an apartment site, and that such market value was $160,000. The university also submitted that this value exceeded (a) the value of the expropriated property when used as a fraternity house (existing use value), and (b) the cost of acquiring and renovating a comparable property for use as a fraternity house.\nThe Ontario Municipal Board accepted the valuation of the experts called on behalf of the university. They arrived at a valuation of $10.25 per square foot for redevelopment as a site for apartments and found this to be more than existing use value. Their evidence was based upon an appraisal of at least twenty-three fraternity houses on St. George Street south of Bloor and elsewhere and, in addition, they considered all the sales since 1957 (over 200 in number) in an area to the north, west and south of the university campus. Hicks first appraised the property on a basis of its redevelopment value as if vacant, and in this connection he selected and listed forty of the sales which he considered most significant.\nStewart (for the fraternity) first valued the expropriated property as if there were no buildings on the property and he worked from eight comparable sales, all of which were within a ten\u2011minute walk of St. George Street. Three of these were on Huron Street, two on Prince Arthur, and two on St. George Street.\nStewart\u2019s second method of appraisal was to compare the expropriated property with the premises at 182 St. George Street, which had been purchased by another fraternity in 1958 for $115,000. He called this the market data approach and by this method he arrived at a valuation of $284,000.\nHicks\u2019 second method of appraisal was to establish the existing-use value as a fraternity house by using the same approach as Stewart except that he considered nine comparable properties which had been sold for fraternity, student residences or office use. He then estimated the price at which the expropriated property would have sold in August 1964 in the light of the established sale price for each of those comparables with certain adjustments. He came up with a figure of $140,000 if sold for fraternity house use in 1964.\nThe Board heard all this evidence and chose to accept the valuations, the procedures and the opinions of Messrs. Hicks and Davis in contrast with those of Mr. Stewart. I can find no error in their choice.\nThe Court of Appeal thought that the value as redevelopment land was too low at $10.25 and should be $12 per square foot. They awarded $170,760 for the land. This was arrived at as follows:\nLand value (15,730 square feet less 1500 square feet at $12.00 per square\nfoot................................................................................................................ $170,760.00\nThey also awarded $30,000 for renovation and reconstruction of any building to be purchased, and $1,500 for moving and incidental expenses, making a total of $202,260. I do not understand why the Court of Appeal valued 14,230 square feet at $12 per square foot and gave no value to the remaining 1,500 square feet. I could understand an increase in the square foot value but for the whole parcel. In any event, I do not think that a case was made out for any increase above the $10.25 per square foot awarded by the Municipal Board. When the Board accepted this figure they were giving effect to the evidence of Hicks based on an exhaustive study of land values for redevelopment purposes based on numerous sales to developers in that area. Of the 40 sales that he considered in toto, only one was at a price as high as $12 a square foot.\nThe second error in the judgment of the Court of Appeal was in giving the sum of $30,000 for renovation and reconstruction of any property which the fraternity might purchase as a substitute. Hicks\u2019 evidence as to existing-use value indicated that in August of 1964, the fraternity should have been able to purchase and, if necessary, renovate at a total cost of $140,000 a property which would have been the equivalent of the expropriated property for use as a fraternity although not in a location with as high a value for redevelopment.\nIn addition, the Court of Appeal awarded $1,500 for moving and incidental expenses, making the total of $202,260. In my opinion, there was error also in awarding this item when compensation was assessed not on the basis of existing-use value, but on the basis of value of the land for its highest and best use. This is a value that the owner cannot realize without moving.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the valuation of the Municipal Board with costs here and below.\nThere was a cross-appeal by the fraternity asking for the value of the land for redevelopment purposes between the brackets of $160,000 and $236,000, plus the depreciated reconstruction cost of the building at $103,754.80. This would involve the assessment of compensation on the basis of reinstatement. It is settled law that this basis is to be applied only when there is no possible market for the property as used. Evidence before the Board fully justified the finding that there was such a market. In fact, there were several sales of such properties in the vicinity at the material time. I would dismiss the cross-appeal with costs.\nHaving read the reasons written by my brother Spence I must with great respect question the principle on which they rest. When formulated by him in Winnipeg Supply & Fuel Co. Ltd. v. Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg[7], it was prefaced by the following sentence:\nIt would seem that no purpose can be served by a review of the jurisprudence in reference to the variation by the Court of Appeal of an award made by an arbitrator.\nI cannot think this is to be taken as a complete rejection by this Court of the authority of precedents. Therefore, I take it that the principle enunciated was accepted as implying no departure from established practice concerning the proper scope of the duty of an appellate tribunal on questions of fact and in particular in the assessment of compensation. However, a review of previous pronouncements of great authority on the subject has driven me to a different conclusion.\nIn The King v. Elgin Realty Co. Ltd.[8], Taschereau J. (as he then was), delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court, said (at p. 51):\nIn expropriation cases it is settled, I think, that when determining the amount, a court of first instance has acted upon proper principles, has not misdirected itself on any matter of law, and that when the amount arrived at is supported by the evidence, a Court of Appeal ought not to disturb its finding. This rule has for many years been the guiding principle in this Court, and a reference may be made to V\u00e9zina v. The Queen (1889), 17 S.C.R. 1. At page 16, Mr. Justice Patterson, with whom concurred Strong J., Fournier J., and Taschereau J., said:\n\u201cWhere the tribunal of first instance has proceeded on correct principles and does not appear to have overlooked or misapprehended any material fact, an appeal against the amount awarded will in most cases resemble an appeal against an assessment of damages in an action, which would be a hopeless proceeding unless some very special reason for the interference of the appellate court can be shown.\u201d\nI have found no case previous to the Winnipeg Supply & Fuel Co. Ltd. judgment in which a decision contrary to that pronouncement was rendered. However, I think I should note that similar views were expressed by the Privy Council in Ruddy v. Toronto Eastern R.W. Co.[9], where they affirmed the unreported judgment of this Court reversing the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario increasing an arbitration award, saying:\nBefore considering the facts and the merits of the case, it is well to examine what is the real nature of the appeal covered by sec. 209. In their Lordships\u2019 opinion, it places the awards of arbitrators under the statute in a position similar to that of the judgment of a trial Judge. From such a judgment an appeal is always open, both upon fact and law. But upon questions of fact an appeal Court will not interfere with the decision of the judge who has seen the witnesses, and has been able, with the impression thus formed fresh in his mind, to decide between their contending evidence\u2014unless there is some good and special reason to throw doubt upon the soundness of his conclusions.\nI should also mention that in Atlantic and North-West Railway Co. v. Wood[10] the Privy Council rejected the contention that on an appeal under the same statute, the Court of Appeal was bound \u201cto decide the case upon and in accordance with their own appreciation of that evidence and not the appreciation of the arbitrators\u201d and held that \u201cthey should review the judgment of the arbitrators as they would that of a Subordinate Court, in a case of original jurisdiction, where review is provided for\u201d.\nOn the authority of those decisions and on principle it appears to me that the duty of an appellate tribunal in expropriation cases does not differ from its duty in reviewing compensation in other cases. On this I do not know of a better statement than that made by the Privy Council in Nance v. British Columbia Electric Railway Company Ltd.[11]:\nWhether the assessment of damages be by a judge or a jury, the appellate court is not justified in substituting a figure of its own for that awarded below simply because it would have awarded a different figure if it had tried the case at first instance. Even if the tribunal of first instance was a judge sitting alone, then, before the appellate court can properly intervene, it must be satisfied either that the judge, in assessing the damages, applied a wrong principle of law (as by taking into account some irrelevant factor or leaving out of account some relevant one); or, short of this, that the amount awarded is either so inordinately low or so inordinately high that it must be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage (Flint v. Lovell, [1935] 1 K.B. 354, approved by the House of Lords in Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, Ld., [1942] A.C. 601). The last named case further shows that when on a proper direction the quantum is ascertained by a jury, the disparity between the figure at which they have arrived and any figure at which they could properly have arrived must, to justify correction by a court of appeal, be even wider than when the figure has been assessed by a judge sitting alone. The figure must be wholly \u201cout of all proportion\u201d (per Lord Wright, Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, Ld., [1942] A.C. 601, 616).\nThis was relied upon and applied in Widrig v. Strazer et al.[12] and Gorman v. Hertz Drive Yourself Stations of Ontario Ltd. et al.[13]\nI do not overlook the fact that the principle stated in the Winnipeg Supply case was also accepted in Saint John Harbour Bridge Authority v. J.M. Driscoll Ltd.[14] This cannot make it binding if at variance with previous decisions of this Court. It must be so under any view of the authority of precedents. If they are held binding, an exception for such case must be made as was noted in Stuart v. Bank of Montreal[15] by a reference to Bozson v. Altrincham Urban District Council[16]. On the other hand, if one rejects the doctrine then the principle is undoubtedly open to reconsideration. On that basis I would say that the rule adopted in respect of the assessment of damages that was also followed in the past in reviewing the assessment of compensation in expropriation cases appears to me preferable.\nAppeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed with costs, Judson and Pigeon JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cassels, Brock, DesBrisay, Guthrie, Griffiths & Genest, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Borden, Elliot, Kelly & Palmer, Toronto.\n[1] [1967] 2 O.R. 185.\n[2] [1966] S.C.R. 336 at 338.\n[3] [1968] S.C.R. 633.\n[4] [1952] Ex.

He was also the owner of a building which he leased, by verbal lease, to the company and in which the company carried on its business. In 1959, 1960 and 1961, funds of the company totalling $71,668.43 were used to effect additions and improvements to the appellant\u2019s property. These were for the use by the company in its business and appear to have been carried in the company\u2019s books as an asset. In 1962, the appellant sold to a third party all the shares of the company as well as the property in question. In assessing the appellant for the years 1959, 1960 and 1961, the Minister, relying on s. 8(1) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, contended that the costs of the additions and improvements to the leased property constituted a benefit or advantage conferred by the company on the appellant as a shareholder. The appellant contended that by virtue of art. 1640 of the Civil Code the additions and improvements were the property of the company and that consequently a benefit had not been conferred on him. The Tax Appeal Board upheld the Minister\u2019s assessment and its decision was affirmed by the Exchequer Court. The taxpayer appealed to this Court. At the hearing, counsel were informed that, if the additions and improvements to the property belonged to the appellant as owner, from the time they were effected, the Court was satisfied that s. 8(1) of the Act applied.\nHeld (Pigeon J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: The costs of the additions and improvements to the leased property constituted a taxable benefit to the appellant during the years in question. It was clear that, from the very outset, it was never contemplated that these additions and improvements would be removed on the termination of the lease. They were of a permanent character, were integrated with the existing buildings and could not be removed with any conceivable economic advantage to the company. Under articles 413 and following of the Civil Code, additions and improvements of this kind are presumed to have become the property of the owner of the immovable by accession. There was nothing in the circumstances of this case which could justify holding that such legal presumption had been rebutted. The mere fact that the cost of the additions and improvements had been paid for by the company and appear to have been carried as an asset in its books was not sufficient to rebut the presumption. Under these circumstances, art. 1640 of the Civil Code could have no application.\nPer Pigeon J., dissenting: In the absence of evidence of a contrary stipulation, the rights of the company as to the improvements were defined by art. 1640 of the Civil Code. By virtue of that article, the improvements made by the company with its own money became its property since it had the right to remove them and the appellant, as owner of the immovable, could only retain them on paying the value. The improvements not having become his property from the time they were effected, no benefit was therefore conferred on the appellant by the company so as to make s. 8(1) of the Act applicable.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014B\u00e9n\u00e9fice attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 un actionnaire\u2014Additions et am\u00e9liorations faites \u00e0 une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 appartenant \u00e0 un actionnaire d\u2019une compagnie et lou\u00e9e \u00e0 cette compagnie\u2014Additions et am\u00e9liorations pay\u00e9es par la compagnie\u2014Un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019actionnaire\u2014Les additions et am\u00e9liorations sont-elles devenues la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019actionnaire\u2014Code civil, art. 413, 1640\u2014Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, art. 8(1).\nL\u2019appelant d\u00e9tenait toutes les actions, ainsi que le contr\u00f4le, d\u2019une compagnie qui fabriquait des fen\u00eatres isolantes.

L\u2019appelant a soutenu qu\u2019en vertu de l\u2019art. 1640 du Code Civil les additions et am\u00e9liorations \u00e9taient la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la compagnie et que par cons\u00e9quent aucun b\u00e9n\u00e9fice ne lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9.

Appel rejet\u00e9, le Juge Pigeon \u00e9tant dissident. APPEAL from a judgment of Dumoulin J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in an income tax matter. Appeal dismissed, Pigeon J. dissenting.\nMaurice R\u00e9gnier and A. Peter F. Cumyn, for the appellant.\nPaul Ollivier, Q.C., Alban Garon and Jean Claude Sarrazin, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014The appellant is a manufacturer and, during the period 1953 to 1962, was the president and principal shareholder of a Company known as Superior Window Co., Ltd.\u2014hereinafter called \u201cthe company\u201d.\nAt the beginning of that period and again in August 1962, he was the beneficial owner of all the issued shares of the company. At all times he controlled the said company. He was also the owner of an immovable property with a building erected thereon in which the company carried on its business of manufacturing insulated windows.\nBy verbal lease, appellant leased the said building to the company on a month to month basis, the rental payable being $435. a month up to and including 1958, and $550. a month from 1959. The property had been purchased in 1953 at a cost of approximately $50,000. In the early years of the lease, all expenses of heating, insurance and taxes were paid by appellant but, in the later years, some of these expenses were paid by the company. The building in question included two dwellings in the upper storeys, the rent of which appears to have been received by the appellant. In 1959, a shed was constructed by the company on the leased premises at a cost of $2,596.55; in 1960, the company made substantial additions to the main building on the property at a cost of $20,963.28, and in 1961 further substantial additions at a cost of $48,108.60.\nThese improvements and additions were for the use by the company in its business. The additions and improvements were carried out and paid for by the company and appear to have been carried in the company\u2019s books as an asset. In August 1962, the appellant sold 313 shares in the capital stock of the company\u2014being all the issued capital stock\u2014for a price of $318,131, and the immovable property above referred to, for a price of $275,000. The description of the property, as contained in the notarial deed of sale, included the statement: \u201cAVEC b\u00e2tisses dessus \u00e9rig\u00e9es, portant les num\u00e9ros civiques 4474 et 4477 du dit Boulevard Sir Wilfrid Laurier, et toutes d\u00e9pendances y attach\u00e9es.\u201d Formal conveyance of the immovable property and the shares was made pursuant to an option contained in a letter dated August 3, 1962 which reads:\nMontr\u00e9al, le 3 ao\u00fbt 1962\nMonsieur Marc Masson Bienvenu,\n210 ouest rue St-Jacques,\nMontr\u00e9al, P.Q.\nCher Monsieur,\nJe vous donne par la pr\u00e9sente, l\u2019option valable jusqu\u2019au 31 ao\u00fbt 1962 d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir ce qui suit:\n313 actions ordinaires de Superior Window Co.

St-Germain\nThe question in issue is whether the amounts of $2,596.55, $20,963.28 and $48,108.60, totalling $71,668.43, the cost of the improvements and additions to the leased property, constituted a benefit to the appellant during the years in question within the provisions of s. 8(1) of the Income Tax Act. That section reads\n8(1) Where, in a taxation year,\n(a) a payment has been made by a corporation to a shareholder otherwise than pursuant to a bona fide business transaction,\n(b) funds or property of a corporation have been appropriated in any manner whatsoever to, or for the benefit of, a shareholder, or\n(c) a benefit or advantage has been conferred on a shareholder by a corporation,\notherwise than\n(i) on the reduction of capital, the redemption of shares or the winding-up, discontinuance or reorganization of its business,\n(ii) by payment of a stock dividend, or\n(iii) by conferring on all holders of common shares in the capital of the corporation a right to buy additional common shares therein,\nthe amount or value thereof shall be included in computing the income of the shareholder for the year.\nThe Tax Appeal Board held that the cost of the improvements and additions to the leased property did constitute a benefit to the appellant under the said section, and that finding was confirmed by the Exchequer Court[2].\nAt the hearing before us, counsel for respondent was informed that, if the improvements and additions to the property belonged to the appellant as owner, from the time they were effected, the Court was satisfied that s. 8(1) does apply and that we did not need to hear him on that point.\nIt is clear to me that, from the very outset, it was never contemplated that these improvements and additions would be removed on the termination of the lease; with the exception of the shed, they were an integral part of, and permanent improvements and additions to, the existing buildings.\nUnder art. 413 and following of the Civil Code, additions and improvements of this kind are presumed to have become the property of the owner of the immovable by accession. While this presumption can be rebutted either expressly or tacitly, I can find nothing in the circumstances of this case which would justify holding that such legal presumption had been rebutted. On the contrary, the letter of August 3, 1962 and the terms of the deed of sale of the immovable property indicate clearly that appellant intended to convey and did convey the whole of the immovable, including the buildings in question. The mere fact that the cost of the improvements and additions had been paid for by a company controlled by appellant, and appear to have been carried as an asset in its books, is not sufficient to rebut the presumption to which I have referred.\nAppellant contended that the improvements and additions in issue here belonged to him in virtue of art. 1640 of the Civil Code which reads\nThe lessee has a right to remove, before the expiration of the lease, the improvements and additions which he has made to the thing leased, provided he leaves it in the state in which he has received it; nevertheless if the improvements or additions be incorporated with the thing leased, with nails, lime, or cement, the lessor may retain them on paying the value.\nI am unable to agree with that submission.\nAs I have stated, the lease, given by appellant to the company controlled by him, was a verbal one and on a month to month basis. The extensive additions and improvements made to the leased premises were of a permanent character, were integrated with the existing buildings and could not be removed with any conceivable economic advantage to the tenant. It was never contemplated that they would be removed. In these circumstances, in my opinion, art. 1640 C.C. can have no application.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nLE JUGE PIGEON (dissident):\u2014Les faits sont relat\u00e9s par mon coll\u00e8gue le juge Abbott. Comme lui, je ne doute pas que si les am\u00e9liorations faites par la compagnie Superior Window Co. Ltd. sont devenues la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 compter du jour o\u00f9 elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es, il en est r\u00e9sult\u00e9 pour lui un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice donnant lieu \u00e0 l\u2019application du para. 1 de l\u2019art. 8 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu.\nDans le cas pr\u00e9sent, il est admis que la compagnie \u00e9tait locataire de l\u2019immeuble de l\u2019appelant en vertu d\u2019un bail verbal. En l\u2019absence de preuve d\u2019une stipulation contraire les droits de la locataire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des am\u00e9liorations se trouvaient donc d\u00e9finis par l\u2019article 1640 C.C.\n1640. Le locataire a droit d\u2019enlever, avant l\u2019expiration du bail, les am\u00e9liorations et additions qu\u2019il a faites \u00e0 la chose lou\u00e9e, pourvu qu\u2019il la laisse dans l\u2019\u00e9tat dans lequel il l\u2019a re\u00e7ue; n\u00e9anmoins si ces am\u00e9liorations et additions sont attach\u00e9es \u00e0 la chose lou\u00e9e, par clous, mortier ou ciment, le locateur peut les retenir en en payant la valeur.\nIl importe de souligner que cet article du code qu\u00e9becois est une r\u00e8gle sp\u00e9ciale que l\u2019on ne trouve pas dans le Code Napol\u00e9on. Cette r\u00e8gle sp\u00e9ciale est indubitablement du droit suppl\u00e9tif c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019elle constitue une condition de tout bail en l\u2019absence de stipulation particuli\u00e8re. Je ne vois pas comment on peut douter qu\u2019elle ait exactement le m\u00eame effet que si elle \u00e9tait transcrite textuellement dans un bail \u00e9crit entre le propri\u00e9taire et la locataire. Si cela avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, comment pourrait-on croire que l\u2019on ait voulu que les am\u00e9liorations faites par la compagnie \u00e0 ses frais ne lui appartiennent pas alors qu\u2019elle avait le droit de les enlever et que le propri\u00e9taire ne pouvait les retenir qu\u2019en en payant la valeur?\nCe n\u2019est pas tout. Ces am\u00e9liorations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrites \u00e0 l\u2019actif de la compagnie dans ses livres et dans son bilan et c\u2019est elle, et non pas l\u2019appelant, qui a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 l\u2019allocation du co\u00fbt capital. Je ne vois pas au nom de quel principe on pourrait soutenir que ces faits sont sans importance et qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019en tenir compte. Ce n\u2019est s\u00fbrement pas parce que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait pour ainsi dire l\u2019unique actionnaire et le principal administrateur que l\u2019on doit en venir \u00e0 une telle conclusion. En effet, supposons qu\u2019il e\u00fbt vendu ses actions de la compagnie sans ali\u00e9ner l\u2019immeuble, les nouveaux actionnaires n\u2019auraient-ils pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en droit de lui dire: \u00abVous avez vous-m\u00eame reconnu que la compagnie avait les droits pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019article 1640 puisque comme son administrateur vous avez approuv\u00e9 des registres et un bilan o\u00f9 les am\u00e9liorations sont inscrites comme lui appartenant. Comment pouvez-vous pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019elles sont votre propri\u00e9t\u00e9?\u00bb En l\u2019absence d\u2019une disposition sp\u00e9ciale de la loi ou d\u2019une fraude, la constitution en corporation d\u2019une compagnie donne naissance \u00e0 une personne morale dont les droits sont enti\u00e8rement distincts de ceux du principal actionnaire et cela est vrai aussi bien envers le fisc qu\u2019envers les individus.\nOn nous a cit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audition ce que dit Mignault au volume 7, page 324:\nQuant aux am\u00e9liorations et additions qui ne peuvent \u00eatre enlev\u00e9es sans d\u00e9grader le fonds, telles que les peintures sur les bois, murs ou plafonds, elles doivent rester, sans indemnit\u00e9, au propri\u00e9taire. Il en est de m\u00eame des am\u00e9liorations qui ne peuvent \u00eatre enlev\u00e9es par le locataire avec avantage pour lui-m\u00eame, telles que les papiers de tenture et autres embellissements de ce genre (arg. de l\u2019art. 417, dernier alin\u00e9a).\nIl est clair que l\u2019exception ne vise que des am\u00e9liorations du genre de celles que l\u2019auteur \u00e9num\u00e8re: peinture, papier peint. On ne saurait l\u2019appliquer \u00e0 des constructions nouvelles \u00e0 charpente d\u2019acier. Par ailleurs, il importe de souligner que dans une note au bas de la page 501 du volume 2, le m\u00eame auteur exprime l\u2019avis que l\u2019art. 1640 est la seule r\u00e8gle \u00e0 suivre dans le cas des am\u00e9liorations faites par un locataire et il le consid\u00e8re comme d\u00e9rogeant \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019accession et ayant pour effet de reconna\u00eetre au locataire le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur les am\u00e9liorations faites par lui. En effet, il qualifie \u00abd\u2019achat par le propri\u00e9taire\u00bb, l\u2019exercice du droit de les retenir en en payant la valeur.\nCitons, \u00e0 titre de comparaison, l\u2019article 1640 qui r\u00e8gle la question des am\u00e9liorations faites par le locataire et de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 qui peut en \u00eatre due par le bailleur. Cette disposition n\u2019existe pas au code Napol\u00e9on.\n(Texte de l\u2019article)\nRemarquons que le locataire n\u2019est pas trait\u00e9 comme le possesseur de mauvaise foi ni encore comme le possesseur de bonne foi, en vertu de l\u2019art. 417. Ainsi, il a le droit absolu d\u2019enlever, sauf, lorsque les am\u00e9liorations sont attach\u00e9es \u00e0 la chose lou\u00e9e par clous, mortier ou ciment, le droit du propri\u00e9taire de garder les am\u00e9liorations en en payant, non le co\u00fbt, ni la plus-value procur\u00e9e au fond, mais la valeur laquelle, bien entendu, doit s\u2019estimer au moment de l\u2019achat de ces am\u00e9liorations. Il est permis de croire que cet achat des am\u00e9liorations par le propri\u00e9taire les immobiliserait, bien qu\u2019elles n\u2019aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9es par lui, car cet achat renferme certainement une destination.\nLa jurisprudence des tribunaux du Qu\u00e9bec est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019opinion de Mignault.\nJe crois devoir ajouter que lorsque l\u2019appelant a n\u00e9goci\u00e9 simultan\u00e9ment la vente de l\u2019immeuble et de ses actions dans la compagnie sa convention avec l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur de l\u2019entreprise comportait la stipulation suivante:\n2. Le vendeur repr\u00e9sente et garantit:\n* * *\ne) que la situation financi\u00e8re de la compagnie, au 30 juin 1962, est telle que montr\u00e9e sur le bilan de cette date qui est annex\u00e9 aux pr\u00e9sentes et dans les livres de la compagnie\u2026\nComme on l\u2019a vu, les am\u00e9liorations dont il s\u2019agit figuraient au bilan et dans les livres comme propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la compagnie. Vu cette stipulation, il ne me para\u00eet pas qu\u2019il y ait lieu d\u2019attacher beaucoup d\u2019importance au fait que l\u2019acte de vente de l\u2019immeuble sign\u00e9 en ex\u00e9cution de cette convention comporte suivant la formule habituelle la cession de l\u2019immeuble \u00abavec b\u00e2tisses dessus \u00e9rig\u00e9es\u2026 et toutes d\u00e9pendances y attach\u00e9es\u00bb.

D\u2019ailleurs, l\u2019acte notari\u00e9 de vente de l\u2019immeuble a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 entre l\u2019appelant et la compagnie. Il me semble tout \u00e0 fait impossible d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter ce document comme comportant une vente \u00e0 la compagnie d\u2019am\u00e9liorations qui lui appartenaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 selon un droit d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019art. 1640 C.C. et reconnu par les \u00e9critures comptables et les bilans par lesquels les deux parties \u00e9taient li\u00e9es.\nDe la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 on a fait \u00e9tat \u00e0 l\u2019audition de l\u2019\u00e9cart important entre le prix d\u2019acquisition de l\u2019immeuble par l\u2019appelant en 1953 et celui de revente \u00e0 la compagnie en 1962. A ce sujet, il faut faire observer que la cotisation de l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9tention que la compagnie lui a conf\u00e9r\u00e9 un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice en faisant cette op\u00e9ration et par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019y a pas de preuve d\u00e9montrant que le prix pay\u00e9 en 1962 exc\u00e8de ce qu\u2019\u00e9tait alors la valeur marchande de l\u2019immeuble qui a pu \u00eatre achet\u00e9 \u00e0 prix d\u2019aubaine environ dix ans auparavant. D\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, les \u00e9tats financiers d\u00e9montrent que le prix pay\u00e9 pour les actions de la compagnie correspond \u00e0 un bilan o\u00f9 les am\u00e9liorations \u00e0 l\u2019immeuble figurent dans l\u2019actif de la compagnie. Les cotisations contest\u00e9es reposent uniquement sur la pr\u00e9tention que l\u2019appelant est devenu propri\u00e9taire des am\u00e9liorations au moment o\u00f9 elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es. C\u2019est pourquoi la seule question \u00e0 juger est celle que formule mon coll\u00e8gue le juge Abbott.\nPour ces raisons, j\u2019infirmerais le jugement de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier et celui de la Commission d\u2019Appel d\u2019Imp\u00f4t sur le Revenu avec d\u00e9pens des deux Cours contre l\u2019intim\u00e9 et j\u2019ordonnerais que les cotisations faisant l\u2019objet de l\u2019appel soient revis\u00e9es suivant les conclusions ci-dessus formul\u00e9es.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, PIGEON J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Stikeman, Elliott, Tamaki, Mercier & Robb, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

Wong (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1968: October 11, 15; 1969: January 28.\nPresent: Cartwright C.J. and Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nBailment\u2014Aircraft rented for solo flight\u2014Pilot and aircraft never seen again\u2014Action in contract and tort against pilot\u2019s executors\u2014No direct evidence of negligence on pilot\u2019s part\u2014Factors equally consistent with negligence and no negligence\u2014Res ipsa loquitur not applicable\u2014Burden of proof.\nAn aircraft owned by the second respondent and leased by him to the respondent company was rented by the company to one T for the purpose of flying, solo, \u201cin a tight flight circuit around Toronto Island Airport\u201d. T, a licensed but inexperienced pilot, took off from the airport and neither he nor the aircraft was ever seen again. In an action brought by the respondents against the executor of T\u2019s estate for damages for the loss of the aircraft, the claim of the respondent company was framed in both contract and tort and that of the second respondent in tort only. The action was dismissed at trial. On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and awarded the respondents $10,500. The executor then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nAdopting the views of the trial judge that it had been satisfactorily demonstrated the loss of the aircraft could have been caused by many other factors as equally consistent with no negligence as with negligence on the part of T and that, accordingly, the maxim res ipsa loquitur did not apply, the claims in negligence, based as they were solely on the application of that maxim, should be dismissed.\nBoth the bailee and the bailed chattel having disappeared and there being no evidence of negligence on the part of the bailee, the rule of evidence whereby the onus is placed on the bailee to disprove negligence was not applicable and the general rules governing proof where performance of a contract has become impossible due to the destruction of the subject-matter should be applied. As the respondents had not adduced any evidence to \u201cestablish a fault or default in the defendant\u201d, the bailment action depended upon the application of the rule embodied in the maxim res ipsa loquitur. As there were factors which might well have caused the loss of the aircraft without any negligence on T\u2019s part, that maxim was not applicable.\nThe appellant had produced an explanation from which it would be just as reasonable for a Court to conclude that the happening occurred without the negligence of the bailee as to conclude that he was negligent. Where there was no direct evidence of negligence, no more could be required of the executor of a deceased bailee who perished with the chattel. Pratt v. Waddington (1911), 23 O.L.R. 178; Macdonell v.

Imperial Smelting Corporation, Ltd., [1941] 2 All E.R. 165, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Moorhouse J. Appeal allowed.\nHugh Rowan, Q.C., and J.G. Pink, for the defendant, appellant.\nB.F. Kennedy, for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 allowing an appeal from a judgment rendered at trial by Mr. Justice Moorhouse and directing that the respondents recover the sum of $10,500 from the appellant in respect of the loss of a Cessna 172A aircraft (hereinafter sometimes referred to as CF-LWE) which had been rented by Wong Aviation Limited to the late Douglas Taylor on October 28, 1962, for the purpose of flying, solo, \u201cin a tight flight circuit around Toronto Island Airport\u201d, and which was lost, together with its pilot. No trace of the aircraft or Taylor has ever been found.\nThe aircraft was owned by the respondent, Anthony M. Wong, and was leased by him to the respondent company which carried on the business of providing flying instruction and of leasing aircraft to licensed pilots at the Toronto Island Airport. Douglas Taylor, although far from being an experienced pilot, was the holder of a valid pilot\u2019s licence and in this sense qualified to fly the aircraft in question under visual flight conditions, although there is no evidence that he had ever flown a Cessna 172A aircraft before. The learned trial judge found that the aircraft was in satisfactory flying condition and had sufficient fuel for the purpose of the projected flight. In opening the argument before us, counsel for the appellant stressed the fact that the claim of the respondent company was framed in both contract and tort, being founded primarily on the appellant\u2019s alleged breach of the contract of bailment in that he failed to return the plane which he had hired, and in the alternative, on the ground that the plane was lost due to Taylor\u2019s negligence. Counsel pointed out that this created a somewhat anomalous situation in that the claim in bailment involved the contention that the onus lay on the appellant to prove that the loss was not caused by Taylor\u2019s negligence, whereas it was acknowledged that in the tort claim the onus of proving negligence rested upon the respondents who relied exclusively on the application of the maxim res ipsa loquitur to discharge it.\nIf the company were the only plaintiff in this action, I do not think that the mere fact of its having pleaded negligence in the alternative would have any great significance. The company\u2019s action is one in bailment. In the present case, however, there are in fact two separate and distinct actions pleaded because the second plaintiff, Anthony M. Wong, who was the owner of the aircraft, was not a party to the contract of bailment and his action depends entirely upon proof that the plane was lost through Taylor\u2019s negligence. This phase of the matter does not appear to have concerned the Courts below, but as I think that Anthony M. Wong\u2019s claim should be dealt with, I find it necessary to make a brief review of the essential allegations in the pleadings.\nIt is alleged in the statement of claim that on October 28 the company, by its servant George Morewood, \u201corally agreed to let on hire to Taylor CF-LWE at a rental at the rate of $17.00 per hour\u201d on the express condition that Taylor was to fly, in accordance with visual flight rules, \u201cin a tight flight circuit around Toronto Island Airport\u201d going no further west than High Park in the City of Toronto and that after completing two such circuits, he was to fly the aircraft back to the airport and land there. It is further alleged that it was an implied condition of hire that Taylor would take due and proper care of the aircraft and would restore it to the company at the airport at the conclusion of the flight in the same condition as that in which he had received it. The breach of this contract is alleged in para. 8 of the statement of claim in the following terms:\nIn breach of the conditions of hire, Taylor has never returned the CF-LWE to the Company at the Toronto Island Airport or elsewhere. The Company and Wong have no knowledge of the whereabouts of CF-LWE or of Taylor after Taylor took\u2026 off from the Toronto Island Airport on the 28th of October, 1962.\nThe claims of Wong and the company in tort are made by reason of The Trustee Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 408, s. 38(2) \u201cfor the loss of CF-LWE due to the negligence of Taylor\u201d. These claims are pleaded in para. 11 of the statement of claim as follows:\nWong as owner of the CF-LWE claims and the Company by way of alternate plea further claims that the loss of CF-LWE was due to the negligence of Taylor and as such loss occurred while CF\u2011LWE was in the sole control and possession of Taylor, the Plaintiffs will rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\nDuring the course of the examination for discovery of Anthony M. Wong, this paragraph was read into the record and the following exchange then took place between Mr. Rowan, acting on behalf of the present appellant, and Mr. Church, acting for the respondents:\nQ. In Paragraph 11 of the Statement of Claim the company claims that the loss of CF\u2011LWE was due to the negligence of Taylor. Can you tell me on what acts of negligence you rely in paragraph 11?\nMR. CHURCH: We rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\nMR. ROWAN: I understand that. Apart from the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, are there any more acts of negligence on the part of Taylor that you rely on?\nMR. CHURCH: No, we have no knowledge of any particular acts. His conduct was beyond reproach at the time the aircraft was rented. Our allegations of negligence are by way of our reliance on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\nMR. ROWAN: Exclusively?\nMR. CHURCH: Yes.\nI think it convenient to deal first with the claims in negligence and to say at the outset that I agree with the finding of the learned trial judge which is expressed in his reasons for judgment in the following language:\nIt was agreed there was no evidence of negligence by Taylor. The plaintiffs rely upon the maxim res ipsa loquitur.\nThe management of the aircraft was under the sole control of Taylor but it has been demonstrated to my satisfaction the loss of the aircraft could have been caused by many other factors as equally consistent with no negligence as with negligence on the part of Taylor. For these reasons I believe that maxim is not here applicable. Many of the explanations of loss are indeed probable without negligence by Taylor. Air turbulence, carburetor icing, loss of vision with reference to ground or horizon to name but three.\nThe learned trial judge then quotes from the decision of this Court in United Motors Service, Inc. v. Hutson[2], where Sir Lyman Duff said:\nBroadly speaking, in such cases, where the defendant produces an explanation equally consistent with negligence and with no negligence, the burden of establishing negligence still remains with the plaintiff.\nAdopting, as I do, these views expressed by the learned trial judge, it follows that I would dismiss the claims in negligence based, as they are, solely on the application of the maxim res ipsa loquitur, and this means that the appeal against Anthony M. Wong should be allowed as he has made no claim in contract.\nMr. Justice Laskin, in the reasons for judgment which he delivered on behalf of the Court of Appeal, was content to limit himself to a consideration of the facts in terms of an action for damages for breach of the contract of bailment and he felt free to leave the maxim res ipsa loquitur out of his consideration altogether saying:\nSince I do not agree that res ipsa loquitur has any place in our law of bailment I need not deal with the contention that it is inapplicable to the facts.\nIt is, I think, significant to note that the Court of Appeal did not disagree with the finding of the learned trial judge that many of the explanations of the loss of the aircraft were \u201cindeed probable without negligence by Taylor\u201d.\nIt appears to me to be obvious that the contract of bailment was dependent for its performance upon the continuing existence of the bailed chattel and the disappearance of the chattel made that performance impossible. Under these circumstances, the bailee\u2019s position at law is well summarized in 2 Hals., 3rd ed., p. 126, para. 242, as follows:\nHe must also return the chattel hired at the expiration of the agreed term. But if the performance of his contract to return the chattel becomes impossible because it has perished, this impossibility (if not arising from the fault of the hirer or from some risk which he has taken upon himself) excuses him. The basic question in this case is whether the onus is upon the bailee\u2019s executor to show that the disappearance did not occur through his fault or on the bailor to prove that it did, and it appears to me that the Court of Appeal has rested its decision on the ground that in the bailment action the burden of proving that Taylor\u2019s negligence was not the cause of the loss lay on the appellant and that this involved the onus of disproving negligence by affirmative proof of reasonable care by Taylor which was not discharged by producing an explanation equally consistent with negligence or no negligence. In reaching this conclusion, Laskin J.A. expressed himself as follows:\nThe jurisprudence of this Court has been clear, at least since Pratt v. Waddington (1911), 23 O.L.R. 178, that on a plea and proof of bailment and non-return of the bailed goods, the bailee must disprove negligence: see also McCreary v. Therrien Construction Co. Ltd. and Therrien, [1951] O.R. 735. I do not think that the type of bailment, whether gratuitous or for reward makes any difference in the application of this proposition. Nor do I think that the proposition is affected by the circumstance that the cause of loss of the bailed chattel is unknown. I readily agree, however, that the evidence offered in exoneration may be different in its thrust according to whether the cause of loss is known or unknown. Where known, the bailee must negative negligence in respect of the occurrence. Where the bailed chattel disappears and the disappearance is unaccountable, the bailee must still disprove negligence by affirmative proof of reasonable care, but he is not to be put to the obligation to show how the loss occurred and then saddled with the duty to disprove negligence in respect thereto: see Macdonnell v. Woods (1914), 32 O.L.R. 283; Brooks Wharf & Bull Wharf, Ltd. v. Goodman Bros., [1936] 3 All E.R. 696; Stables v. Bois, [1956] O.W.N. 164, 3 D.L.R. (2d) 701. Indeed, proof of the cause of loss does not inevitably carry disproof of negligence, although in particular circumstances it may do so\u2026\nIn the last two sentences of the next paragraph of his reasons for judgment, the learned judge says:\nI note that counsel for the plaintiffs was content to rest his appeal on the proposition that the bailee, or the defendant in this case, had the burden of bringing forth a reasonable explanation of how the aeroplane may or could have been lost without the bailee\u2019s negligence. In putting his case on this footing he was apparently accepting the burden of persuasion if the evidence on the whole case was in balance, but, as already pointed out, this is not the law of Ontario.\nEarlier in his reasons for judgment, Mr. Justice Laskin expressed the opinion that \u201cthe principles of proof do not vary merely because the bailee and the chattel bailed disappeared together\u201d, but we were not referred to any reported cases in which this had happened and it appears to me to be desirable to examine the cases cited by Laskin J.A. in order to determine whether they afford any authority for imposing on the executor of a dead bailee the same onus of disproving negligence that rests upon one who knows all about the circumstances of the chattel\u2019s disappearance and is alive to give evidence.\nThe case of Pratt v. Waddington, supra, was one in which the plaintiff had loaned a horse to the defendant who in turn, without obtaining any permission from the plaintiff, had loaned it to a third party by the name of Spain who used it for heavy work as a result of which it died within three weeks. In the course of his reasons for judgment, Middleton J. said:\nHere the defendant was entirely in the wrong; the loan of the horse was to him, and he had no right to pass it on to Spain\u2026 It [the horse] was subject to conditions and risks not contemplated by the bailment; the defendant, and Spain holding the horse under him, have the means of shewing what was done, and in fairness and in law the onus is upon them to excuse the default in making due return.\nThat was a case of gratuitous bailment in which it was clear that the death of the horse was a consequence of the bailee\u2019s breach of contract in loaning it to a third party without the bailor\u2019s authority, and it is significant to note that the third party, who knew more than anyone else about the cause of the horse\u2019s death, was alive and was not called to give evidence at the trial. In the present case there is no suggestion that the loss was in any way related to a breach of contract by Taylor, there is no evidence of negligence, and there was nobody available who knew the circumstances under which the loss occurred.\nThe case of Macdonnell v. Woods, supra, was one in which a trunk had been left at a rooming house for safekeeping pending the plaintiff\u2019s arrival and the defendant\u2019s servant undertook to send it to the room which the plaintiff had booked, but in breach of this contract, the trunk was left in the passageway unprotected from whence it was stolen. This was clearly another case in which the goods were lost through a breach of the contract by the bailee, and, like the Pratt case, the principles upon which it was decided do not, in my view, apply to a case where the bailee and the chattel bailed have disappeared together and there is no evidence of negligence or breach of contract by the bailee. Stables v. Bois[3], was a case in which the plaintiff had left his car in a garage for repairs when one of the servants of the garage owner bailee was using an acetylene torch to remove the muffler from another car in the garage. A fire broke out and the garage, together with the plaintiff\u2019s car, was destroyed. There was no evidence that the operator of the acetylene torch had made any inspection of the gasoline tank in the car that he was working on and it was shown to be a common occurrence that would be known and anticipated by an experienced operator for such an acetylene torch to flash back.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario, in an oral judgment rendered by Laidlaw J.A., held that the burden lay on the garage owner to show that his servant had not been negligent and concluded by saying:\nIn those circumstances, and in the light of that evidence, how could it be found that the defendant had explained this happening in such a manner that the Court could reasonably consider that there was no negligence on the part of the defendant? We think the onus was not satisfied and that on the evidence that conclusion is the reasonable one to reach.\nThat was a case where the garage mechanic who knew all about the cause of the fire was available to give evidence and where the circumstances themselves were such as to require an explanation.\nIt is interesting to note, however, that even under these circumstances Mr. Justice Laidlaw\u2019s decision appears to have turned on the fact that the defendant had given no explanation from which the Court could reasonably conclude that there was no negligence on the part of the defendant. With all respect, this does not appear to me to afford any authority for the broad statement made by Mr. Justice Laskin to the effect that under the law of Ontario it is not enough for a bailee to bring forth a reasonable explanation of how the bailed chattel could have been lost without his negligence.\nThe case cited by Mr. Justice Laskin which is closest to the present case is that of McCreary v. Therrien Construction Co. Ltd. and Therrien[4], where the defendant had rented a \u201ccabin trailer\u201d from the plaintiff for use as living quarters for himself and others and the trailer was destroyed by fire while in the defendant\u2019s possession. It was held that in these circumstances the onus rested on the bailee to show that the loss of the property had not resulted from negligence or improper conduct on his part, and Mr. Justice Laidlaw, who wrote the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, made a careful review of the authorities and concluded by explaining the principle governing the burden of proof in bailment cases in the language which was used by Atkin L.J. in The \u201cRuapehu\u201d[5]. Mr. Justice Laidlaw said:\nLord Justice Atkin explains the grounds upon which the principle is founded, and I quote his language as follows: \u201cThe bailee knows all about it; he must explain. He and his servants are the persons in charge; the bailor has no opportunity of knowing what happened. These considerations, coupled with the duty to take care, result in the obligation on the bailee to show that that duty has been discharged.\u201d\nAlthough Mr. Justice Laidlaw and Lord Atkin referred to this as \u201ca principle\u201d it might, in my view, be more accurately described as a rule of evidence and as it is one which has the practical effect of placing on the bailee the heavy onus of proving a negative (i.e. that he was not negligent) it should, in my opinion, only be invoked in cases where all the considerations stipulated by Lord Atkin can be found to be present.\nIn the present case, even if Taylor had survived, it is by no means certain that a pilot of his meagre experience would have been able to explain the reason for the loss of the plane; but in any event, he is not available to explain the accident. In a case such as this where the bailee is dead, it seems to me to be quite unrealistic to apply a rule, one of the basic considerations for which is that \u201cthe bailee knows all about it; he must explain\u201d. In this case nobody \u201cknows all about it\u201d, indeed, nobody knows anything about it. Both the bailee and the bailed chattel have disappeared and there is no evidence of negligence on the part of the bailee. I am accordingly of opinion that the rule explained by Lord Atkin respecting burden of proof in bailment cases does not apply to the peculiar circumstances of this case and that the general rules governing proof where performance of a contract has become impossible due to the destruction of the subject-matter, should be applied. Those rules are best stated by Lord Russell of Killowen in Joseph Constantine Steamship Line, Ltd. v. Imperial Smelting Corporation, Ltd.[6], where he said:\nThe defendant will prove the destruction of the corpus, and, where possible, the event which brought it about. It may be that the event is of such a nature as of itself to raise a prima facie case of fault or default in the defendant. Unless he displaces that prima facie case, he will be unable to rely on the doctrine. The frustration will stand as self-induced. On the other hand, it may be that nothing is known as to what event brought about the destruction, or the known event may be of such a nature as of itself to raise no prima facie case of fault or default in the defendant. If the matter rests there, he will be excused from liability under the contract. The plaintiff, however, may by cross\u2011examination, or independent evidence, or both, establish a cause of fault or default in the defendant. If the matter rests there, the defendant will be unable to rely on the frustration, which will stand as self-induced. In every case, the contractor will succeed or fail in his defence on frustration according as it is or is not found as the result of the whole evidence that the frustration was self-induced.\nThis statement of law was applied by Coady J. in McDonald Aviation Co. Ltd. v. Queen Charlotte Airlines Ltd.[7], where a leased aeroplane was destroyed by fire and its pilot and his passenger were killed. Mr. Justice Coady\u2019s decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[8].\nAs the respondents in the present case have not adduced any evidence to \u201cestablish a fault or default in the defendant\u201d, the outcome of the bailment action must depend upon whether \u201cthe event is of such a nature as of itself to raise a prima facie case of fault or default\u2026\u201d. In other words, the bailor\u2019s action depends upon the application of the rule embodied in the maxim res ipsa loquitur.\nI do not find it necessary to review the facts which were so fully considered in the Courts below as I think it sufficient to say that I agree with the learned trial judge that the weather conditions which prevailed while Taylor was in the air were such as to support an inference that air turbulence, carburetor icing or loss of vision with reference to the ground might well have caused the loss of the aircraft without any negligence on Taylor\u2019s part, and that the maxim last referred to is therefore not applicable. With the greatest respect, I am unable to agree with Mr. Justice Laskin that \u201cthe principles of proof do not vary merely because the bailee and the chattel bailed disappear together\u201d. As I have indicated, I think that the rule explained by Lord Atkin in The \u201cRuapehu\u201d, supra, is based on the fact that the bailee, who knew all about the circumstances of the loss and who was under a duty to take care of the chattel, is required to explain its disappearance, and it seems to me that this proposition loses its force when the bailee has disappeared with the chattel and that it is unrealistic to apply such a rule to his executor who obviously knows nothing about the circumstances.\nI do not think it desirable, except in the clearest of cases, for a question of liability to be determined on the sole ground that the strict rules of evidence regarding the shifting of the onus of proof have not been complied with. In my view, in cases such as this, what is to be looked to is the evidence as a whole, and in the present case when the evidence is so viewed, it appears to me that the appellant has produced an explanation from which it would be just as reasonable for a Court to conclude that the happening occurred without the negligence of the bailee as to conclude that he was negligent. I do not think that, where there is no direct evidence of negligence, any more can be required of the executor of a deceased bailee who perished with the chattel.\nI do not find it necessary to deal with the argument that the respondents voluntarily accepted the risk of the loss of the aircraft, nor do I base my decision in any way on the student\u2011instructor relationship which the learned trial judge found to have existed between the appellant and the respondents.\nFor all these reasons I would allow this appeal and set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal, with costs both here and in the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Tory, Tory, DesLauriers & Binnington, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents: Manning, Bruce, Toronto.\n[1] [1966] 2 O.R. 182, 56 D.L.R.

The principal issue was which party had the right of way under s. 164 of the Act. The defendant was travelling in a southerly direction when, after signalling a left turn with his turn signal, he turned left across the centre line into the path of the plaintiff, who was half a block from the intersection, proceeding towards the north. When the plaintiff realized that the defendant was not going to stop he swerved to his right in an attempt to avoid the defendant\u2019s car. However, the two vehicles collided in the curb lane northbound and as a result of the collision the plaintiff was injured.\nIn answer to questions the jury found both parties negligent, the defendant in the degree of 75 per cent and the plaintiff in the degree of 25 per cent. The defendant was found to have been negligent in that he did not exercise due care and attention and the plaintiff in that he assumed he had the right of way and in so doing failed to take the proper action at an early stage. The plaintiff\u2019s general damages were assessed at $35,000 and the special damages were agreed in the amount of $1,209.\nAs a result of the jury\u2019s verdict judgment was entered for 75 per cent of the general damages awarded and the agreed special damages. On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the defendant\u2019s appeal and dismissed the action. An appeal by the plaintiff was then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, allowing an appeal from a judgment of Verchere J. sitting with a jury.

At the conclusion of the argument of counsel for the respondent, the Court retired and on returning the following judgment was delivered:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (orally for the Court):\u2014Mr. Barrett we do not find it necessary to hear you in reply.\nWe are all of opinion that there was ample evidence to support the findings of the jury including their apportionment of the degrees of blame. The answers of the jury must be read as a whole and in the light of the charge of the learned trial judge. We are unable to agree with the view of the Court of Appeal that it was implicit in the answers of the jury that they found that the defendant had the right of way. We find no error in the charge to the jury either on the question of liability or as to the assessment of damages. We cannot say that the amount at which the jury assessed the damages was inordinately high.\nThe appeal is allowed with costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal, the judgment of the Court of Appeal is set aside and that at the trial is restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Mussallem, Lakes & Co., Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Paine, Edmonds, Mercer & Co., Vancouver.\n",

These notes were not transferable and could be applied by the holder within a stated time to the purchase of a car of not less than a specified value. In the appellant\u2019s accounts, credit notes outstanding were treated as current liabilities. If they were not redeemed, the amount at expiration was removed from accounts payable and treated as a profit. The Minister took the view that the outstanding credit notes were not existing liabilities and should be disallowed under s. 12(1) (e) of the Income Tax Act as being contingent. The Tax Appeal Board set aside the Minister\u2019s assessment, but this judgment was reversed by the Exchequer Court. The taxpayer appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nIt was not possible to uphold the Minister\u2019s contention that the issuance of a credit note did not create any contract or agreement giving rise to any liability or obligation because, in particular, there was no agreement as to the price or the model of the car which could be purchased by the customer on presenting the credit note. The note could not be considered apart from the transaction out of which it arose. It was part of the consideration for an executed contract, the purchase of a used car. It could not be considered otherwise than as evidence of the conditions of the appellant\u2019s obligation to pay the balance of the purchase price. The customer had an enforceable obligation for that balance. Even if the notes were to be considered by themselves they could not be considered as unenforceable for indefiniteness.\nThe wording of s. 12(1)(e) of the Act clearly refers to accounting practice. This provision is to be construed by reference to proper accounting practice in a business of the kind with which one is concerned. The evidence showed that in the appellant\u2019s accounts credit notes were treated according to standard practice as current liabilities until they were redeemed or expired.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014D\u00e9ductions\u2014Commer\u00e7ant d\u2019automobiles d\u00e9livrant des notes de cr\u00e9dit\u2014Notes rachetables sur achat subs\u00e9quent d\u2019une automobile avant une certaine date\u2014Les notes non rachet\u00e9es sont-elles des exigibilit\u00e9s ou des comptes de pr\u00e9voyance\u2014Principes de comptabilit\u00e9\u2014Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, art. 12(1)(a), (e).\nLa compagnie appelante faisait le commerce d\u2019automobiles usag\u00e9es et, en paiement partiel d\u2019automobiles usag\u00e9es qu\u2019elle acqu\u00e9rait, donnait parfois des notes de cr\u00e9dit.

Appel accueilli.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], in an income tax matter. Appeal allowed.\nJohn Hopwood, for the appellant.\nG.W. Ainslie, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nPIGEON J.:\u2014Appellant is a used car dealer also selling new cars to a limited extent. Credit notes are sometimes given in partial payment of used cars acquired for resale. In such case, the cash payment and the amount of the credit note are stated in the bill of sale. The note is signed by both parties and the conditions are set forth on its face. These are that:\n1. It is not transferable;\n2. It is valid only within a stated delay, usually between one and two years;\n3. It is good only for the purchase of a car of not less than a stated value. Sometimes the credit note would be good for the purchase of a new car but generally it was good for the purchase of any used car owned by the appellant of not less than a specified value. The price of the cars offered for sale was posted but, of course, bargaining was not excluded. In appellant\u2019s accounts credit notes outstanding were treated as current liabilities. If they were not redeemed, the amount at expiration was removed from accounts payable and treated as a profit.\nIn 1965, the Minister took the view that the outstanding credit notes were not existing liabilities and should be disallowed for tax purposes as being contingent. On that basis, reassessments were issued whereby additional tax was levied for appellant\u2019s 1961, 1962 and 1963 taxation years disallowing $4,415, $9,870 and $1,615 in those years respectively. By judgment dated December 23, 1966, signed by Maurice Boisvert, the Tax Appeal Board allowed the taxpayer\u2019s appeal. This judgment was reversed by Gibson J. on further appeal to the Exchequer Court[2] (March 13, 1968).\nOn the appeal to this Court, counsel for the Minister contended that when appellant issued each credit note there was not, in fact, created any contract or agreement which would give rise to any liability or obligation because, in particular, there was no agreement as to the price or the model of car which could be purchased by the customer upon presentment of the credit note. This contention cannot be upheld. The credit note should not be considered apart from the transaction out of which it arises. It is part of the consideration for an executed contract, the purchase of a used car. Under that contract, appellant became obliged to pay a stated sum of money, a part only of that sum was paid in cash, the balance remaining due was stipulated payable in merchandise of a stated kind. While the contract is spelled out in two separate documents, the bill of sale and the credit note, the latter cannot be considered otherwise than as evidence of the conditions of the obligation to pay the balance of the purchase price. That obligation must be considered as subsisting until satisfied or expired. No special reason was advanced, no authority was cited to support the contention that the credit note should be considered otherwise. The fact that the merchandise to be obtained by virtue of a credit note was not specified does not mean that appellant\u2019s customer had no enforceable obligation for the balance due. He could select any of the cars offered for sale coming within the general description in his credit note and require delivery by tendering the note and cash to make up the posted price. Appellant could not have evaded this obligation by posting inflated prices. This would have been a fraud against which the credit note holder would have been entitled to a remedy.\nEven if the credit notes were to be considered by themselves they could not be considered as unenforceable for indefiniteness. It should be noted that Viscount Dunedin\u2019s dictum in May & Butcher v. The King[3] (Feb. 22, 1929):\nTo be a good contract there must be a concluded bargain, and a concluded contract is one which settles everything that is necessary to be settled and leaves nothing to be settled by agreement between the parties.\nwas explained in a later decision of the House of Lords, Hillas & Co. v. Arcos Ltd.[4]. Reversing a judgment of the Court of Appeal based on it Lord Wright said (at pp. 507-508):\nWhen the learned lord justice speaks of essential terms not being precisely determined, i.e. by express terms of the contract, he is, I venture with respect to think, wrong in deducing as a matter of law that they must, therefore, be determined by a subsequent contract; he is ignoring, as it seems to me, the legal implication in contracts of what is reasonable, which runs throughout the whole of modern English law in relation to business contracts. To take only one instance, in Hoadly v. McLaine, Tindal C.J. (after quoting older authority), said (10 Bing. at p. 487):\n\u2018What is implied by law is as strong to bind the parties as if it were under their hand. This is a contract in which the parties are silent as to price, and therefore leave it to the law to ascertain what the commodity contracted for is reasonably worth.\u2019\nThat decision was relied on by Estey J. in Dawson v. Helicopter Exploration Co. Ltd[5].\nRespondent\u2019s second contention is that because appellant\u2019s obligation was conditional it should not, until the condition was realized, be treated for purposes of income tax as a current liability but as an amount properly to be entered in a contingent account. As a result, the deduction would be prohibited by s. 12(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act:\n12(1) In computing income, no deduction shall be made in respect of\n(e) an amount transferred or credited to a reserve, contingent account or sinking fund except as expressly permitted by this Part,\nThe wording of that provision clearly refers to accounting practice. The only expression applicable to the present case is not \u201ccontingent liability\u201d but \u201ccontingent account\u201d. This means that the provision is to be construed by reference to proper accounting practice in a business of the kind with which one is concerned. In the present case, the only evidence of accounting practice is that of appellant\u2019s auditor, a chartered accountant. His testimony shows that in appellant\u2019s accounts credit notes are treated according to standard practice as current liabilities until they are redeemed or expired. They are not classed as contingent liabilities. When asked why he considered the obligation under a credit note as current liability and the obligation under a warranty as contingent, he said:\n\u2026 the credit note, while it is a liability, is also an existing obligation today. A warranty may be a liability in the future. It may be determinable in the future but isn\u2019t an existing obligation until the future. At least, this is my interpretation of the difference.\nWith respect, Gibson J. was in error in holding that whether or not appellant\u2019s financial statements were drawn up according to generally accepted accounting principles could be disregarded. On the contrary, the wording of the relevant provision of the Income Tax Act implies that this is the essential question.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Exchequer Court set aside, with costs both in this Court and in the Court below; and it should be ordered that the reassessments of the taxation years 1961, 1962 and 1963 be referred back to the Minister of National Revenue for reassessments and adjustments in accordance with these reasons.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hopwood & Molyneux, Calgary.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

In 1961, he acquired the debentures and shares of Sonograph and Semco, two related companies in a loss position and on the verge of bankruptcy. For a sum of $15,000, he acquired $100,000 debentures of Sonograph in default as to interest and approaching maturity; 2,100 shares of Sonograph at a par value of $100; $102,000 debentures of Semco in default as to interest and approaching maturity; and 3,000 common shares of no par value of Semco. It was agreed that the two companies would first make an arrangement with their creditors\u2014but not in respect of a $112,000 debt owed by Sonograph to Semco. The respondent\u2019s private company sold its inventory of stamps to Sonograph and was authorized to buy and sell stamps for the benefit of that company. In 1962 and 1963, Sonograph profits from the stamp business (which profits were exempt from tax by reason of the application of past losses) allowed that company to pay off its indebtedness to Semco of $112,000. Semco was thus able to redeem its debentures held by the respondent in the amount of $102,000. The Minister assessed the respondent\u2019s profit, $102,000 less $15,000, as income. The Exchequer Court allowed an appeal from that assessment. The Court ruled that the profit was not income from a business or adventure in the nature of trade, nor income from a source within the meaning of s. 3, nor a benefit under s. 8(1) or s. 137(2). The Minister appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The Minister\u2019s appeal should be allowed.\nThe profit was realized in an adventure in the nature of trade and was therefore taxable as income from a business. The acquisition of the debentures was a part of a profit-making scheme. The purpose of the operation was not to earn income from the debentures but to make a profit on prompt realization. The operation had therefore none of the essential characteristics of an investment, it was essentially a speculation.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Profit sur achat et remboursement d\u2019obligations d\u2019une compagnie insolvable et dont les pertes durant les ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes exc\u00e9daient les revenus\u2014Le profit a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 dans une \u00abaffaire d\u2019un caract\u00e8re commercial\u00bb et est imposable\u2014Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, art. 3, 4, 8(1), 137(2), 139(1)(e).

Il fut convenu que les deux compagnies feraient au pr\u00e9alable un arrangement avec leurs cr\u00e9anciers\u2014une dette de $112,000 due \u00e0 Semco par Sonograph n\u2019\u00e9tant pas comprise dans cet arrangement. La compagnie priv\u00e9e de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a vendu \u00e0 Sonograph son inventaire de timbres et fut autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 acheter et \u00e0 vendre des timbres pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de cette derni\u00e8re. En 1962 et 1963, les profits que Sonograph a tir\u00e9s de l\u2019entreprise (lesquels profits \u00e9taient exempts d\u2019imp\u00f4t en raison de l\u2019application des pertes ant\u00e9rieures) lui ont permis d\u2019acquitter sa dette de $112,000 envers Semco. Cette derni\u00e8re a alors pu racheter ses obligations au montant de $102,000 d\u00e9tenues par l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le Ministre a cotis\u00e9 le profit r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9, $102,000 moins $15,000, comme \u00e9tant un revenu. La Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a accueilli un appel de cette cotisation et elle a statu\u00e9 que le profit n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un revenu provenant d\u2019une entreprise ou d\u2019une affaire d\u2019un caract\u00e8re commercial, ni un revenu d\u2019une provenance quelconque dans le sens de l\u2019art. 3, ni un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice en vertu de l\u2019art. 8(1) ou de l\u2019art. 137(2).

L\u2019acquisition des obligations faisait partie d\u2019un projet dont le but \u00e9tait de r\u00e9aliser un profit. Le but de l\u2019op\u00e9ration n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de tirer un un revenu des obligations mais de faire un profit sur prompte r\u00e9alisation.

Appel accueilli.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in an income tax matter. Appeal allowed.\nG.W. Ainslie, Q.C., and D.G.H. Bowman, for the appellant.\nTerence Sheard, Q.C., and C.R. Archibald, Q.C., for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nPIGEON J.:\u2014The respondent is a successful stamp dealer. He caused to be incorporated J.N. Sissons Limited, a private company controlled by him and to which he transferred, after the incorporation, his inventory of stamps. In 1961, he sought to obtain financial advantages through the acquisition of securities of two companies in a loss position: Sonograph Limited (\u201cSonograph\u201d) and Sonograph Engineering & Manufacturing Company Limited (\u201cSemco\u201d). In that view, he successfully negotiated a transaction whereby for a total sum of $15,000 he acquired:\n(i) $100,000 6% first debentures of Sonograph, due October 31st, 1961 in default as to interest, but in respect of which all interest had been waived until maturity,\n(ii) 2,100 5% non-cumulative preference shares of $100 par value of Sonograph,\n(iii) $102,000 6% first debentures of Semco issued in two series, $72,000 due October 15, 1962 and $30,000 due November 1, 1963, both series being in default as to interest, but in respect of which all interest had been waived until maturity, and\n(iv) 3,000 common shares of no par value of Semco.\nSonograph and Semco were related companies on the verge of bankruptcy. It was a condition of respondent\u2019s bargain that an arrangement with the creditors would be completed under the Bankruptcy Act before the acquisition of the securities would be completed. Respondent undertook to place the companies in a position to make the necessary cash payments for such purpose in the amount of $20,000 and he postponed his rights as debenture holder of Sonograph to those of the Royal Bank as holder of new debentures in the amount of $50,000 in order that needed funds could be obtained from that Bank.\nTo enable Sonograph to earn profits respondent, as part of the operation, caused Sissons Limited to sell to Sonograph its inventory of stamps for $150,000, this being apparently a fair market price for such a bulk sale. Sissons Limited retained physical possession of the inventory and was authorized to sell it for the account of Sonograph. It was also authorized to make new acquisitions of stamps so as to keep the stamp business active for the benefit of Sonograph. The latter\u2019s past losses being applicable against its profits from the stamp business, these became exempt from corporate income tax and were available to pay off an indebtedness to Semco in the amount of $112,000 which had been thoughtfully excluded from the arrangement with the creditors. The scheme was so successful that after only one year, in October 1962, Semco was able to redeem $72,000 of its debentures and the balance, namely $30,000, a year later shortly before they matured.\nRespondent was assessed for income tax on the amounts thus received by him less his cost of $15,000 that was deducted in full from the first payment. The issue is whether his profit of $57,000 in 1962 and of $30,000 in 1963 is income or a capital gain.\nIn the Exchequer Court[2] Gibson J., after reciting the facts, made the following finding that was not challenged before us:\n\u2026it is apparent, and the appellant admits it, that the said second transaction out of which the redemption of these debentures arose, the subject matter of this appeal, would not have been entered into unless the said first transaction was also entered into, and vice-versa. As a consequence, this was not a simple purchase of debentures which were realized upon at maturity; it was something more than that, namely, the purchase was a part of a whole transaction involving several parts, and the cause of the redemption was due to many factors, as the above brief summary of the facts shows.\nHowever, he held that respondent\u2019s profit was not income from a \u201cbusiness\u201d within the meaning of 139(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act nor income from a source within the meaning of s. 3. He also said that the sums received by the respondent were not benefits conferred on him within the meaning of either s. 8(1) or s. 137(2). Accordingly the appeal from the assessment was allowed.\nThe first question to be considered is obviously whether respondent\u2019s profit is income from a \u201cbusiness\u201d bearing in mind that by virtue of the statutory definition this includes \u201can adventure in the nature of trade\u201d. The reasons and conclusions of the trial judge on this point are as follows:\n\u2026upon a full review and consideration of the facts in this case, since these debentures (a) came into existence for a full consideration in a market over which the appellant had no control, (b) the discounts arose unfortuitously by a capital loss to the original owners thereof, and (c) were purchased by the appellant in an arm\u2019s length transaction, the purchase price thereby representing the then market value; and since the gain, being the amount of these said discounts, to the appellant, from the redemption of these debentures arose, in part, from the indirect efforts of the appellant through J.N. Sissons Limited, which company in turn earned income working for Sonograph in selling its inventory of stamps and merchandising new inventory and, in part, fortuitously, both in a substantial way, I am of opinion that the purchasing of these debentures and the holding of them to maturity by the appellant was not a \u2018business\u2019\u2026\nWith respect, I am unable to agree for the following reasons.\n(a) That the debentures came into existence for a full consideration in a market over which the appellant (respondent in this Court) had no control is irrelevant to the issue which is the character of the operation whereby he subsequently acquired them. It is also inconclusive, when an investment dealer underwrites a bond issue such is usually the situation, it is nonetheless a business operation.\n(b) The loss to the original owners is equally immaterial and inconclusive. If a man in difficult financial circumstances sells a prized possession, say an old painting, to an art dealer for a fraction of what it is worth, the dealer\u2019s profit on the resale is clearly income although the former owner has suffered a capital loss when disposing of it.\n(c) That the acquisition was in an arm\u2019s length transaction at market value is also irrelevant and inconclusive. Even if a stock promoter obtains shares in a new mining company at full market price, a profit he makes on the resale, if the promotion is successful, is undoubtedly from a \u201cbusiness\u201d.\n(d) As to the fact that the gain arose at least in part from respondent\u2019s efforts, this clearly tends to show not that it is a capital gain but profit from a \u201cbusiness\u201d. One of the characteristics of income from such a source is that it is essentially the result of the businessman\u2019s efforts.\n(e) Finally, respondent\u2019s gain cannot properly be considered as having arisen fortuitously. On the contrary, uncontradicted evidence shows that it is the result of a carefully considered plan executed as conceived. It is true that there is some evidence that the profits from the stamp business carried on for the benefit of Sonograph were greater and quicker than anticipated. This does not make them fortuitous in the legal sense.\nFor the respondent to escape taxation on his gain from the operation he has to show that it is to be characterized as an investment. Otherwise, the conclusion is inescapable that it is an adventure in the nature of trade. In support of the judgment in the Court below, counsel for the respondent relied essentially on the decision of this Court in Irrigation Industries Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue[3]. In that case, an otherwise inactive company had purchased from a mining company 4,000 treasury shares of an initial issue of 500,000 shares. The majority held that this was an investment and that the gain obtained by selling the shares at a profit a few weeks later was not income. Martland J. said (at p. 351):\nIn my opinion, a person who puts money into a business enterprise by the purchase of the shares of a company on an isolated occasion, and not as a part of his regular business, cannot be said to have engaged in an adventure in the nature of trade merely because the purchase was speculative in that, at that time, he did not intend to hold the shares indefinitely, but intended, if possible, to sell them at a profit as soon as he reasonably could. I think that there must be clearer indications of \u201ctrade\u201d than this before it can be said that there has been an adventure in the nature of trade.\nHere the clear indication of \u201ctrade\u201d is found in the fact that the acquisition of the securities was a part of a profit-making scheme. The purpose of the operation was not to earn income from the securities but to make a profit on prompt realization. The operation has therefore none of the essential characteristics of an investment, it is essentially a speculation.\nIn Irrigation Industries the tests that were applied to decide if the operation was an adventure in the nature of trade were (at p. 352):\n(1) Whether the person dealt with the property purchased by him in the same way as a dealer would ordinarily do and (2) whether the nature and quantity of the subject-matter of the transaction may exclude the possibility that its sale was the realization of an investment, or otherwise of a capital nature, or that it could have been disposed of otherwise than as a trade transaction.\nThe following was quoted from Viscount Simonds\u2019 judgment in Edwards v. Bairstow[4]:\nI find \u2018activities which led to the maturing of the asset to be sold\u2019 and the search for opportunities for its sale, and, conspicuously, I find that the nature of the asset lent itself to commercial transactions. And by that I mean, what I think Rowlatt J. meant in Leeming v. Jones, (1930) 1 K.B. 279, that a complete spinning plant is an asset which, unlike stocks or shares, by itself produces no income and, unlike a picture, does not serve to adorn the drawing room of its owner. It is a commercial asset and nothing else.\nThose observations apply with peculiar force in the instant case where the asset is a lot of debentures at or close to maturity. They could not be considered as acquired for income.\nApplying the second test it was observed that the acquisition of corporate shares \u201cis a well recognized method of investing capital in a business enterprise\u201d. Such is certainly not the case for debentures coming to maturity. Respecting the quantity, it was said (at p. 353):\nFurthermore, the quantity of shares purchased by the appellant in the present case would not, in my opinion, be indicative of an adventure in the nature of trade, as it constituted only 4,000 out of a total issue of 500,000 shares.\nHere it is the whole issue of debentures that was acquired. Also, while the acquisition was not made in the way in which an investment dealer would, it was in no way done as an investment is normally made. It was part of a scheme for quickly making a very substantial profit out of the prompt realization of debentures payable immediately or in the near future.\nThere can be no doubt that the acquisition of mortgages by an individual is of its nature just as much an investment as the acquisition of corporate debentures or of company shares: Wood v. Minister of National Revenue[5]. However, it is established by two decisions of this Court that when such acquisition by its frequency and other cir- cumstances takes on the character of a business, it is no longer an investment although all the mortgages are held to maturity: Scott v. Minister of National Revenue[6], Minister of National Revenue v. MacInnes[7]. It is equally well established that even a single operation entered into for gain takes a business character when it cannot properly be considered as an investment but is to be characterized as a speculation. In such circumstances, it is an adventure in the nature of trade: Fraser v. Minister of National Revenue[8], Minister of National Revenue v. Freud[9].\nHaving come to the conclusion that respondent\u2019s gain is a profit from an adventure in the nature of trade, it follows that it is income from a \u201cbusiness\u201d and it becomes unnecessary to consider the Minister\u2019s alternative submissions. Consequently, no opinion is expressed as to the correctness of the conclusions in the Court below on those points.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs and respondent\u2019s appeal to the Exchequer Court from his revised assessments for income tax must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D.S.

Bank of Montreal [1969] S.C.R. 515\nDate: 1969-01-28\nANDREW HAWRISH (Defendant) APPELLANT;\nAND BANK OF MONTREAL (Plaintiff) RESPONDENT.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN\n1968, Nov, 6*, 1969, Jan, 28\nContracts\u2014Guarantee in writing\u2014Alleged collateral oral agreement\u2014Terms of two contracts in conflict\u2014Whether parol evidence of collateral agreement admissible.\nThe appellant, a solicitor, signed, without having previously read, a guarantee to the respondent bank for the indebtedness and liability of a company which was formed for the purpose of buying the assets of a second company in which the appellant had an interest. The guarantee was on the bank's usual form and stated that it was to be a continuing guarantee and to cover existing as well as future indebted\u00adness of the company to the amount of $6,000.\nThe company having become insolvent, and being indebted to the bank in an amount in excess of $6,000, the bank brought an action against the guarantor for the full amount of his guarantee. The defence was that when he signed the guarantee, the guarantor had an oral assurance from the assistant manager of the branch that the guarantee was to cover only existing indebtedness and that he would be released from his guarantee when the bank obtained a joint guarantee from the directors of the company. Two such guarantees were received by the bank.\nThe trial judge dismissed the action. On appeal, the Court of Appeal reversed this decision and gave judgment for the bank. On appeal to this Court, the argument was confined to two submissions of error contained in the reasons of the Court of Appeal: (a) that the con\u00adtemporaneous oral agreement found by the trial judge neither varied nor contradicted the terms of the written guarantee but simply pro\u00advided by an independent agreement a manner in which the liability of the appellant would be terminated; and (b) that oral evidence proving the making of such agreement, the consideration for which was the signing of the guarantee, was admissible.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe appellant's argument failed on the ground that the collateral agreement allowing for the discharge of the appellant could not stand as it clearly contradicted the terms of the guarantee bond which stated that it was a continuing guarantee.\nLindley v.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Davis J. Appeal dismissed.\nThe Honourable C. H. Locke, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nS. J. Walker, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014This action was brought by the Bank of Montreal against Andrew Hawrish, a solicitor in Saskatoon, on a guarantee which the solicitor had signed for the indebt\u00adedness and liability of a newly formed company, Crescent Dairies Limited. This company had been formed for the purpose of buying the assets of Waldheim Dairies Limited, a cheese factory in which Hawrish had an interest.\nBy January 1959, the line of credit granted by the bank to the new company was almost exhausted. The bank then asked Hawrish for a guarantee, which he signed on January 30, 1959. The guarantee was on the bank's usual form and stated that it was to be a continuing guarantee and to cover existing as well as future indebtedness of the company up to the amount of $6,000.\nThe defence was that when he signed the guarantee, Hawrish had an oral assurance from the assistant manager of the branch that the guarantee was to cover only existing indebtedness and that he would be released from his guarantee when the bank obtained a joint guarantee from the directors of the company. The bank did obtain a joint guarantee from the directors on July 22, 1959, for the sum of $10,000. Another joint guarantee for the same amount was signed by the directors on March 22, 1960. Between the dates of these two last-mentioned guarantees there had been some changes in the directorate.\nHawrish was never a director or officer of the new com\u00adpany but at the time when the action was commenced, he was a shareholder and he was interested in the vendor com\u00adpany. At all times the new company was indebted to the vendor company in an amount between $10,000 and $15,000. Hawrish says that he did not read the guarantee before signing. On February 20, 1961, Crescent Dairies Ltd., whose overdraft was at that time $8,000, became insolvent. The bank then brought its action against Hawrish for the full amount of his guarantee-$6,000.\nThe trial judge dismissed the bank's action. He accepted the guarantor's evidence of what was said before the guarantee was signed and held that parol evidence was admissible on the ground that it was a condition of signing the guarantee that the appellant would be released as soon as a joint guarantee was obtained from the directors. He relied upon Standard Bank v. McCrossan[2]. The Court of Appeal[3] reversed this decision and gave judgment for the bank. In their view the parol evidence was not admissible and the problem was not the same as that in Standard Bank v. McCrossan. Hall J.A. correctly stated the ratio of the Standard Bank case in the following paragraph of his reasons:\nIn my opinion the learned trial Judge erred in holding that the respondent was able to establish such condition by parol evidence. The condition found, if indeed it is one, was not similar to that which existed in Standard Bank v. McCrossan, supra, in that it did not operate merely as a suspension or delay of the written agreement. It may be permissible to prove by extraneous evidence an oral agreement which operates as a suspension only.\nThe relevant provisions of this guarantee may be sum\u00admarized as follows:\n(a) It guarantees the present and future debts and liabilities of the customer (Crescent Dairies Ltd.) up to the sum of $6,000.\n(b) It is a continuing guarantee and secures the ulti\u00admate balance owing by the customer.\n(c) The guarantor may determine at any time his further liability under the guarantee by notice in writing to the bank. The liability of the guarantor continues until determined by such notice.\n(d) The guarantor acknowledges that no representations have been made to him on behalf of the bank; that the liability of the guarantor is embraced in the guarantee; that the guarantee has nothing to do with any other guarantee; and that the guarantor intends the guarantee to be binding whether any other guarantee or security is given to the bank or not. The argument before us was confined to two submissions of error contained in the reasons of the Court of Appeal:\n(a) that the contemporaneous oral agreement found by the trial judge neither varied nor contradicted the terms of the written guarantee but simply provided by an independent agreement a manner in which the liability of the appellant would be terminated; and\n(b) that oral evidence proving the making of such agreement, the consideration for which was the signing of the guarantee, was admissible.\nI cannot accept these submissions. In my opinion, there was no error in the reasons of the Court of Appeal. This guarantee was to be immediately effective. According to the oral evidence it was to terminate as to all liability, present or future, when the new guarantees were obtained from the directors. But the document itself states that it was to be a continuing guarantee for all present and future liabilities and could only be terminated by notice in writ\u00ading, and then only as to future liabilities incurred by the customer after the giving of the notice. The oral evidence is also in plain contradiction of the terms of para. (d) of my summary above made. There is nothing in this case to permit the introduction of the principle in Pym v. Campbell[4], which holds that the parol evidence rule does not prevent a defendant from showing that a document formally complete and signed as a contract, was in fact only an escrow.\nThe appellant further submitted that the parol evidence was admissible on the ground that it established an oral agreement which was independent of and collateral to the main contract.\nIn the last half of the 19th century a group of English decisions, of which Lindley v. Lacey[5], Morgan v. Griffit[6]' and Erskine v. Adeane[7] are representative, established that where there was parol evidence of a distinct collateral agreement which did not contradict nor was inconsistent with the written instrument, it was admissible. These were cases between landlord and tenant in which parol evidence of stipulations as to repairs and other incidental matters and as to keeping down game and dealing with game was held to be admissible although the written leases were silent on these points. These were held to be independent agreements which were not required to be in writing and which were not in any way inconsistent with or contra\u00addictory of the written agreement.\nThe principle formulated in these cases was applied in Byers v. McMillan[8]. In this case Byers, a woodcutter, agreed in writing with one Andrew to cut and deliver 500 cords of wood from certain lands. The agreement contained no provision for security in the event that Byers was not paid upon making delivery. However, before he signed, it was orally agreed that Byers was to have a lien on the wood for the amount to which he would be entitled for his work and labour. Byers was not paid and eventually sold the wood. The respondents, the McMillans, in whom the contract was vested as a result of various assignments, brought an action of replevin. It was held by a majority of this Court that they could not succeed on the ground that the parol evidence of the oral agreement in respect of the lien was admissible. Strong J., with whom the other members of the majority agreed, said at p. 202:\n... Erskine v. Adeane [supra] ; Morgan v. Griffith [supra] ; Lindley v. Lacey [supra], afford illustrations of the rule in question by the terms of which any agreement collateral or supplementary to the written agreement may be established by parol evidence, provided it is one which as an independent agreement could be made without writing, and that it is not in any way inconsistent with or contradictory of the written agreement.\nThese cases (particularly Erskine v. Adeane which was a judgment of the Court of Appeal) appear to be all stronger decisions than that which the appellant calls upon us to make in the present case, for it is difficult to see how an agreement, that one who in writing had undertaken by his labor to produce a chattel which is to become the property of another shall have a lien on. such product for the money to be paid as the reward of his labor, in any way derogates from the contemporaneous or prior writing. By such a stipulation no term or provision of the writing is varied or in the slightest degree infringed upon; both agreements can well stand together; the writing provides for the performance of the contract, and the consideration to be paid for it, and the parol agreement merely adds something respecting security for the payment of the price to these terms. In Heilbut, Symons & Co. v. Buckleton[9], a case having to do with the existence of a warranty in a contract for the sale of shares, there is comment on the existence of the doctrine and a note of caution as to its application:\nIt is evident, both on principle and on authority, that there may be a contract the consideration for which is the making of some other contract. \"If you will make such and such a contract I will give you one hundred pounds,\" is in every sense of the word a complete legal contract. It is collateral to the main contract, but each has an independent existence, and they do not differ in respect of their possessing to the full the character and status of a contract. But such collateral contracts must from their very nature be rare. The effect of a collateral contract such as that, which I have instanced would be to increase the consideration of the main contract by 100 \u00a3., and the more natural and usual way of carrying this out would be by so modifying the main contract and not by executing a concurrent and collateral contract. Such collateral contracts, the sole effect of which is to vary or add to the terms of the principal contract, are therefore viewed with suspicion by the law. They must be proved strictly. Not only the terms of such contracts but the existence of an animus contrahendi on the part of all the parties to them must be clearly shewn. Any laxity on these points would enable parties to escape from the full performance of the obligations of contracts unquestionably entered into by them and more especially would have the effect of lessening the authority of written contracts by making it possible to vary them by suggesting the existence of verbal collateral agreements relating to the same subject-matter.\nBearing in mind these remarks to the effect that there must be a clear intention to create a binding agreement, I am not convinced that the evidence in this case indicates clearly the existence of such intention. Indeed, I am disposed to agree with what the Court of Appeal said on this point. However, this is not in issue in this appeal. My opinion is that the appellant's argument fails on the ground that the collateral agreement allowing for the discharge of the appellant cannot stand as it clearly contradicts the terms of the guarantee bond which state that it is a continuing guarantee.\nThe appellant has relied upon Byers v. McMillan. But upon my interpretation that the terms of the two contracts conflict, this case is really against him as it is there stated by Strong J. that a collateral agreement cannot be estab\u00adlished where it is inconsistent with or contradicts the written agreement. To the same effect is the unanimous judgment of the High Court of Australia in Hoyt's Pro\u00adprietary Ltd. v. Spencer[10], which rejected the argument that a collateral contract which contradicted the written agreement could stand with it. Knox C.J., said at p. 139:\nA distinct collateral agreement, whether oral or in writing, and whether prior to or contemporaneous with the main agreement, is valid and enforceable even though the main agreement be in writing, provided the two may consistently stand together so that the provisions of the main agreement remain in. full force and effect notwithstanding the collateral agreement. This proposition is illustrated by the decisions in Lindley v. Lacey [supra], Erskine v. Adeane [supra], De Lassalle v. Guildford, [1901] 2 K.B. 215, and other cases.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellant: Schmitt, Robertson, Muzyka, Beaumont & Barton, Saskatoon.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Walker, Agnew, MacKay de Hercus, Saskatoon.\n[ScanLII Collection]\n* PRESENT : Abbott, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\n[1] (1967), 61 W.W.R. 16, 63 D.L.R.

In the agreement, the licensee acknowledged the validity of the patents and agreed not to be an adverse party to any action disputing their validity. After the expiration of the agreement, the Minister of Defence Production, pursuant to s. 20(1) of the Defence Production Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 62, agreed to indemnify CAE for its continued use of the patents. The Crown having refused to entertain its claim for compensation on the ground that the patents were invalid, the suppliant filed a petition of right in the Exchequer Court to determine whether it had a right to compensation. A preliminary question, set down for hearing before trial, was whether after the expiration of the agreement CAE and the Crown were precluded from denying the validity of the patents. The Exchequer Court ruled that neither CAE nor the Crown were estopped. The suppliant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe words in the acknowledgement clause did not constitute a representation of fact. An acknowledgement of a fact is not a representation of a fact. There was no representation of fact intended to induce the suppliant to change its position to its detriment. It was simply a contractual obligation inserted to protect the patentee and binding upon the licensee for the life of the licensing agreement.\nBrevets\u2014Contrat conc\u00e9dant une licence\u2014Reconnaissance de la validit\u00e9 du brevet par le porteur de licence et engagement de ne pas la contester\u2014Le porteur de licence n\u2019est pas emp\u00each\u00e9 de nier la validit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration du contrat\u2014Loi sur la production de d\u00e9fense, S.R.C. 1952, c. 62, art. 20\u2014Loi sur les brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203.\nLa demanderesse et la compagnie CAE ont convenu par contrat que la compagnie CAE aurait le droit d\u2019utiliser certains brevets appartenant \u00e0 la demanderesse. Dans le contrat, le porteur de licence a reconnu la validit\u00e9 des brevets et a convenu qu\u2019il ne serait pas une partie adverse dans toute action mettant en doute leur validit\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration du contrat, le Ministre de la Production de d\u00e9fense a convenu, en vertu de l\u2019art. 20(1) de la Loi sur la production de d\u00e9fense, S.R.C. 1952, c. 62, d\u2019indemniser la compagnie CAE pour tout usage subs\u00e9quent des brevets.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Jackett P. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, concerning the hearing before trial of certain questions of law. Appeal dismissed.\nI. Goldsmith, for the suppliant, appellant.\nK.E. Eaton and G.A. Macklin, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014Curtiss-Wright Corporation is the owner of a number of Canadian patents relating to the manufacture of flight training apparatus. On December 3, 1952, with the knowledge and approval of the Crown, it entered into a licensing agreement with Canadian Aviation Electronics (referred to as CAE) under which this company obtained the right to use these patented inventions in the manufacture of flight training apparatus in Canada for defence purposes. CAE agreed to pay to Curtiss-Wright royalties of 7\u00bd per cent of the selling price on the apparatus made under the agreement and, in addition, the cost of certain technical assistance. Curtiss-Wright also made an agreement with the Crown under which it agreed to provide engineering and technical assistance to CAE for a stated sum.\nBoth agreements expired in December 1957, except that the licensing agreement was extended in a limited respect which does not affect the issue which has to be decided in this appeal. CAE continued to manufacture flight training apparatus under contract from the Department of Defence Production. By a letter dated July 8, 1958, and pursuant to s. 20(1) of the Defence Production Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 62, the Minister of Defence Production directed CAE not to pay any royalties to Curtiss-Wright and agreed to indemnify the company against any claims for royalties arising out of the manufacture, sale, maintenance, repair and overhaul of any flight training apparatus.\nCurtiss-Wright then sought compensation from the Crown under s. 20(3) of the Defence Production Act. The Crown refused to entertain the claim on the ground that the appellant\u2019s patents were invalid.\nCurtiss-Wright then filed a petition of right in the Exchequer Court to determine whether it had a right to compensation. This was done as a preliminary to proceeding before the Commissioner of Patents to have the amount of compensation ascertained. Before embarking on the trial, the Exchequer Court decided to dispose of two preliminary questions of law. The first of these was:\n1. Whether on the true construction of the licensing agreement, CAE could be precluded in any proceedings by the suppliant for patent infringement after the expiration of the agreement from denying the validity of any patents to which it applies.\nThe answer of the Exchequer Court[2] was that CAE was not estopped from contesting the validity of the patents after the expiration of the licensing agreement and that consequently, the Crown was not estopped from contesting their validity in proceedings for compensation under s. 20, subs. (3) of the Defence Production Act. With this opinion I agree.\nCounsel for the appellant founded his argument on clause XVI of the agreement. This reads:\nLicensee hereby acknowledges the validity of the patents made the subject of this Agreement, and under which Licensee is now or hereafter licensed and agrees not voluntarily to become an adverse party, directly or indirectly, to any suit or action disputing the validity of said patents or any of them.\nHis contention was that the principle of common law estoppel applied as the words \u201clicensee hereby acknowledges the validity of the patents\u201d were a representation not that the patents were valid but that the licensee accepted the fact that they were valid. To me this argument is without substance. The words do not constitute a representation of fact. Counsel for the appellant is claiming far too much for the word \u201cacknowledges\u201d. As the President of the Exchequer Court pointed out, an acknowledgment of a fact is not a representation of a fact.\nTo me, the meaning and effect of clause XVI are both clear. The licensee \u201cacknowledged\u201d, \u201cadmitted\u201d or \u201cagreed\u201d (and it does not matter which word is used) that the patents were valid. The licensee also agreed not to become an adverse party \u201cdirectly or indirectly, to any suit or action disputing the validity of the said patents or any of them\u201d. Clause XVI contains no representation of fact which was intended to induce Curtiss-Wright to change its position to its detriment. It was simply a contractual obligation inserted to protect the patentee and binding upon the licensee for the life of the licensing agreement.\nThe President of the Exchequer Court came to this conclusion on a consideration of clause XVI in the context of the agreement, and particularly clause XI dealing with the rights of the parties upon the expiration, termination or cancellation of the agreement. It is unnecessary for me to go into the matter in further detail. On this branch of the case I am in complete agreement with the Exchequer Court.\nThe Exchequer Court also went on to consider a further question, which was:\n2. Assuming an affirmative answer to the first question, whether on a true construction of s. 20 of the Defence Production Act the respondent (the Crown) is precluded from raising an issue as to the validity of any of the patents by way of defence to the suppliant\u2019s claim for compensation under that section for the alleged use by CAE of such patents regardless of whether such alleged use constitutes a breach of the licensing agreement.\nAlthough the President recognized that the question did not require an answer in view of the answer given to question 1, nevertheless he did express the opinion that the Crown was not precluded from contesting the validity of the patents. It is not necessary in this Court to express an opinion on this question.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the suppliant, appellant: Goldsmith & Caswell, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\n[1] [1968] 1 Ex.

Applications for patents were made by the appellant and the respondents. The Commissioner of Patents found that a conflict existed between their claims and awarded the claims in conflict to the respondent H. The appellant brought an action in the Exchequer Court, pursuant to s. 45(8) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203, for a determination of its rights. By paragraph 7 of its statement of claim, the appellant alleged that claim C1 in the applications of both parties covered more than was invented in respect to which any party was entitled to a patent and that the appellant was entitled, as between the parties, to a patent including a substitute claim for claim C1. The respondent H applied for an order striking out this paragraph of the statement of claim or, in the alternative, for particulars. The order to strike out was made by the Exchequer Court. An appeal was launched to this Court, where the issue raised was as to what may properly be pleaded in a statement of claim filed in pursuance of s. 45(8) of the Act.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe pleadings under s. 45(8) of the Patent Act are not limited to a determination of the sort of issue defined in paragraph (d) of the subsection, i.e., which of the applicants is entitled, as against the others, to the issue of a patent including the claim in conflict as applied for by him. Subsection (8) does not give a right of appeal from the determination made by the Commissioner under subsection (7), but enables one of the applicants to commence an action in the Exchequer Court \u201cfor the determination of their respective rights\u201d. Each paragraph of subsection (8) is given equal status and the Court is empowered to make a determination under any of the four paragraphs. An action could be brought to obtain any one or more of the kinds of determination provided for by paragraphs (a) to (d) inclusive.\nBrevets\u2014Conflit de demandes\u2014Action devant la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier\u2014D\u00e9claration\u2014Requ\u00eate pour faire rayer un paragraphe de la d\u00e9claration\u2014Que peut-on all\u00e9guer dans la d\u00e9claration\u2014Loi sur les brevets, S.R.C. 1952, c. 203, art. 45(8).\nDes demandes de brevets ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par l\u2019appelante et les intim\u00e9es.

Appel accueilli.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of No\u00ebl J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada, striking out a paragraph of the statement of claim. Appeal allowed.\nRussell S. Smart, Q.C., and Robert H. Barrigar, for the appellant.\nDouglas S. Johnson, Q.C., and William M. Thorn, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from an order of the Exchequer Court striking out paragraph 7 of the appellant\u2019s Statement of Claim in an action brought by the appellant against the respondents in that Court.\nThe circumstances giving rise to these proceedings are as follows: Applications for patents were made by the appellant and by the respondents. The applications are in conflict by reason of the appearance in each of them of claims designated by the Commissioner of Patents as C1 to C14 inclusive. By his decision, made pursuant to s. 45(7) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203, he awarded these claims to the respondent Hazeltine Corporation.\nSubsection (7) of s. 45 provides as follows:\n(7) The Commissioner, after examining the facts stated in the affidavits, shall determine which of the applicants is the prior inventor to whom he will allow the claims in conflict and shall forward to each applicant a copy of his decision, a copy of each affidavit shall be transmitted to the several applicants. The action in the Exchequer Court was brought by the appellant, pursuant to subs. (8) of that section, which states:\n(8) The claims in conflict shall be rejected or allowed accordingly unless within a time to be fixed by the Commissioner and notified to the several applicants one of them commences proceedings in the Exchequer Court, for the determination of their respective rights, in which event the Commissioner shall suspend further action on the applications in conflict until in such action it has been determined either\n(a) that there is in fact no conflict between the claims in question,\n(b) that none of the applicants is entitled to the issue of a patent containing the claims in conflict as applied for by him,\n(c) that a patent or patents, including substitute claims approved by the Court, may issue to one or more of the applicants, or\n(d) that one of the applicants is entitled as against the others to the issue of a patent including the claims in conflict as applied for by him.\nIn paragraph 7. of the Statement of Claim, the appellant made the following allegation:\n7. The plaintiff says that claim C1 covers more than was invented in respect to which any party hereto is entitled to a patent, and the plaintiff is entitled, as between the parties, to a patent including a substitute claim for claim C1 approved by the Court.\nThe prayer for relief contained the following paragraphs, seeking the Court\u2019s determination:\n(b) That none of the applicants is entitled to the issue of a patent containing claim C1 as applied for by them.\n(c) That the plaintiff is entitled to the issue of a patent including a substitute claim for claim C1 approved by the Court.\nThe respondent Hazeltine Corporation applied for an order striking out paragraph 7 of the Statement of Claim, or, in the alternative, for particulars as to what claim C1 covers that is more than was invented in respect to which any party is entitled to a patent and particulars as to the substitute claim to which the appellant alleges it is entitled. An order was granted striking out paragraph 7 of the Statement of Claim.\nThe issue which is thus raised is as to what may properly be pleaded in a statement of claim filed in pursuance of s. 45(8) of the Patent Act.\nThis Court decided in Radio Corporation of America v. Philco Corporation (Delaware)[1], that it was not open to a plaintiff, in proceedings taken pursuant to s, 45(8), to attack claims contained in an application in relation to which no conflict had been found by the Commissioner, and that proceedings under that subsection were restricted to a determination of the respective rights of the parties in relation to the subject-matter of the claims put in conflict by, the Commissioner. That case, however, is not decisive in respect of the present appeal, where the issue relates to claim C1, which is in conflict.\nThe basis for striking out paragraph 7 of the Statement of Claim is to be found in the reasoning contained in some recent decisions of the Exchequer Court, of which Texaco Development Corporation v. Schlumberger Limited[2], The Carborundum Company v. Norton Company[3], and E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company v. Allied Chemical Corporation[4] are examples. The effect of these decisions is stated in the last mentioned case, at p. 152, as follows:\nIn my view, what this Court is authorized to deal with under section 45(8) of the Patent Act is a claim by a party who has failed to obtain a favourable decision from the Commissioner that he is entitled, as against the person who obtained the favourable decision, to the issue of a patent including the conflict claims, \u201cas applied for by him\u201d (paragraph (d) of section 45(8)). This requires that evidence be placed before the Court by the plaintiff designed to show that the plaintiff\u2019s inventor did invent the invention, and when he invented it, and either that the defendant\u2019s inventor did not invent it or that he did but at a time subsequent to the making of the invention by the plaintiff\u2019s inventor. The defendant, of course, is entitled to adduce evidence in relation to the same matters. The upshot of all the evidence may be that the Court is convinced that it cannot adjudicate in favour of either of the parties under section 45(8)(d), but\n(a) that there is in fact no conflict, in which case it adjudicates under section 45(8)(a), or\n(b) that none of the parties is entitled to the issue of a patent containing the claims in conflict as applied for by him, in which case it adjudicates under section 45(8)(b).\nI reiterate that I do not regard either of such latter possible classes of judgment as being the purpose of section 45(8) proceedings. I regard them as judgments arising incidentally in the course of proceedings designed to obtain a judgment under section 45(8)(d).\nThe effect of this interpretation of s. 45(8) of the Patent Act is that the task of the Exchequer Court, in proceedings brought pursuant to that subsection, is restricted to a determination of the sort of issue defined in paragraph (d) of the subsection, i.e., which of the applicants is entitled, as against the others, to the issue of a patent including the claims in conflict as applied for by him. The evidence to be led is to show that the plaintiff\u2019s inventor did invent the invention, when he did it, and that the defendant\u2019s inventor did not invent it, or did so at a later time. Consequently the pleadings are to be limited to that issue.\nOn this interpretation of the subsection, paragraph (a), (b) and (c) do not have application except incidentally, in the course of proceedings designed to obtain a judgment under paragraph (d). It is not the purpose of proceedings under s. 45(8) to obtain the kind of judgment contemplated in the paragraphs other than (d), and consequently the pleadings should relate only to the issue under that paragraph. The Court may make a determination under one of the other paragraphs but should do so only incidentally to proceedings under paragraph (d).\nWith great respect, I am unable to interpret s. 45(8) in that way, whether or not the consequences of such an interpretation are desirable. Subsection (7) limits the jurisdiction of the Commissioner to a determination as to which of the applicants is the prior inventor to whom he will allow the claims in conflict. If the task of the Exchequer Court had been intented also to be limited to that issue, the statute could have provided merely for an appeal from the Commissioner to the Court. But subs. (8) does not give a right of appeal. Instead, it enables one of the applicants involved in conflict proceedings to commence an action in the Exchequer Court \u201cfor the determination of their respective rights\u201d.\nIf an action is commenced, the Commissioner must suspend further action on the applications in conflict until, \u201cin such action\u201d, it has been determined either\n(a) that there is no conflict;\n(b) that none of the applicants is entitled to the issue of a patent containing the claims in conflict;\n(c) that a patent or patents, including substitute claims, approved by the Court, may issue to one or more of the applicants; or\n(d) that one of the applicants is entitled as against the others to the issue of a patent including the claims in conflict. Subsection (8) does not require that the Court must first seek to make a determination under paragraph (d) and only make a secondary determination under paragraph (a), (b), or (c) in the alternative. Each paragraph is given equal status, and the Court is empowered to make a determination under any of the four paragraphs.\nIn my view s. 45(8) enables any applicant involved in conflict proceedings, where a determination has been made by the Commissioner, to commence an action in the Exchequer Court to seek to obtain, in relation to the claims in conflict, any one or more of the kinds of determination by the Court for which paragraphs (a) to (d) inclusive provide. As in any other proceeding seeking relief, it is essential that the pleadings should allege the facts on the basis of which the relief is sought, and should specify that relief.\nThis interpretation of subs. (8) is supported by the decision of this Court in Kellogg Company v. Kellogg[5]. That case involved two conflicting applications for a patent. The respondent was an assignee by mesne assignments in respect of an invention by John L. Kellogg Jr., who, the Commissioner decided, was the prior inventor. The appellant commenced proceedings in the Exchequer Court pursuant to s. 44(8) of The Patent Act, 1935, c. 32, Statutes of Canada, 1935, the predecessor of the present s. 45(8). The appellant claimed, inter alia, that if John L. Kellogg Jr. was the first inventor, he had been, at the time of the invention, an employee of the appellant, and that the invention was made in the course of his employment while carrying out work, which he had been instructed to do, on the appellant\u2019s behalf, and that he was a trustee of the invention for the benefit of the appellant. The pleadings alleging this trust and the prayer based upon it were struck out in the Exchequer Court on the ground that this issue could not be raised in proceedings under s. 44(8).\nThe appeal to this Court was allowed. Rinfret J., as he then was, said, at p. 248:\nAlthough the occasion for the appellant\u2019s action was the decision of the Commissioner that the respective applications of the appellant and of the respondent were in conflict and that he would allow the claims to the respondent, the appellant, in bringing suit against the respondent, was not limited to an action for the purpose of having it determined either that there was no conflict between the claims in question, or that none of the applicants was entitled to the issue of a patent containing the claims in conflict, or that a patent or patents (including substitute claims approved by the Court) may issue to one or more of the applicants; but the Exchequer Court could also decide that one of the applicants was entitled, as against the other, to the issue of a patent including the claims in conflict, as applied for by him. We have already seen that such was the express enactment of subs. 8 of s. 44 of the Patent Act, 1935.\nAnd, for the determination of the latter point, we see nothing in the Act or in the law which could prevent the appellant from urging any fact or contention necessary or useful for the purpose of enabling the Court to decide between the parties.\nThis passage makes it clear that the Court was of the opinion that the appellant could bring a suit to seek any of the kinds of determination contemplated in s. 44(8), which are the same as those defined in the present s. 45(8).\nParagraph 7 of the Statement of Claim in this action is drawn with a view to obtaining the kind of determination contemplated in paragraphs (b) and (c). It is undoubtedly drawn in very broad and general terms, but the respondent has, in its notice of motion, applied for an order for particulars, in the alternative to an order to strike out the paragraph, and that phase of the application has not yet been decided.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed, with costs, and the order under appeal should be set aside.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Smart & Biggar, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Hazeltine Corporation: MacBeth & Johnson, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Philco-Ford Corporation (Delaware): Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\n[1] [1966] S.C.R. 296, 32 Fox Pat.

Following an operation the knee was healing well and the surgeon (the second defendant) decided that it would be wise to begin active exercises in order to mobilize the knee. He felt that because the patient had an unusual reaction to pain she would be most reluctant to flex her knee against a sensation of pain and, accordingly, he decided she would benefit from assistance by the third defendant in performing the exercises. The third defendant was a remedial gymnast and an employee of the surgeon and of the defendant medical clinic. The surgeon issued written instructions to the said employee that no force was to be used and no pressure applied. While P was undergoing the recommended treatment, her right knee-cap was refractured.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s action was maintained by the trial judge in the amount of $20,000 general and $7,085 special damages. On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and dismissed the action. An appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the trial judgment restored.\nPer Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.: As it was established that the employee was acting contrary to his instructions in applying passive pressure to the patient\u2019s knee and that the injury could reasonably have resulted from that fact, the onus was on the employee to establish that the fracture did, in fact, occur not because he was acting contrary to instructions and applying pressure, but because the plaintiff jerked backwards on the plinth, inducing the muscle contraction that caused the break.\nThe employee\u2019s evidence failed to support the proposition that the plaintiff suddenly pulled her leg back and that the fracture occurred at that moment. This being so, the only reliable theory explaining the injury was that it was caused in accordance with the trial judge\u2019s finding that the employee \u201cwas negligent on this occasion in applying some pressure, contrary to his instructions, to assist movement, and in not exercising as much care as was reasonably necessary under the circumstances, and that his negligence was responsible for the fracture which occurred\u201d.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: The reason why the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment at trial was that the inferences drawn by the trial judge were not supported by the evidence and the findings of fact as made by him, and that on these findings of fact there was no believable evidence to support an inference of negligence against the physiotherapist. The reasons of the Court of Appeal should be affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, allowing an appeal from a judgment of Smith J. Appeal allowed and judgment at trial restored, Judson J. dissenting.\nW.C. Newman, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nGordon F. Henderson, Q.C., and E. Peter Newcombe, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba which allowed an appeal by the respondents from the judgment of Smith J. who had maintained the appellant\u2019s action against the respondents in the amount of $20,000 general and $7,085 special damages and costs.\nThe action arose out of the refracture of Kathleen Rae Pearce\u2019s right knee-cap on January 11, 1961, when she was undergoing treatment in the Mall Medical Clinic being administered by the respondent Boyce, a remedial gymnast. Boyce was an employee of the respondents Bruser and Mall Medical Group. No negligence is or was asserted against the respondent Bruser who is a well-known orthopaedic surgeon practising in Winnipeg. The liability, if any, of the respondents Mall Medical Group and Bruser depends entirely on whether their employee Boyce was negligent.\nMrs. Pearce fractured her right knee-cap in an unusual accident in her home in the early morning of December 1, 1960, when she struck her right knee against the bedpost in her bedroom. She consulted her physician, Dr. McKenty, and was referred by him to the respondent Dr. Bruser. Dr. Bruser operated on the knee on December 2, removing fragments of bone which had broken off at the lower end of the patella. He found that higher on the patella there was an incomplete transverse fracture which did not extend to the articular cartilage. There was no displacement of the bone in the area of the fracture. Being of the opinion that the fracture would become solid and that reconstituting the extensor apparatus in and around the knee would produce an excellent result, he repaired the knee accordingly and the leg was then immobilized in a cast.\nSome two weeks later the cast was changed to a lighter one. On December 28 the cast was bivalved so that it could be taken off and replaced readily. X-rays were taken at this time, and Dr. Bruser found that in the X-ray plates the transverse fracture appeared \u201cfuzzy\u201d, indicating it was healing very well. He was of opinion that clinical soundness was not yet complete. He prescribed that Mrs. Pearce should continue to wear the cast, but to remove it once a day and sit in a warm bath, and with the water supporting the injured leg she was to try and bend and straighten it for fifteen or twenty minutes each day. Mrs. Pearce returned to the Mall Clinic on January 2, 1961, and her knee was again examined by Dr. Bruser. She was able at this time to raise the leg out of the back half of the cast without pain. She could flex the knee about 20 degrees and straighten it again without pain. In Dr. Bruser\u2019s view, the knee looked very well, and he decided that it would be wise to begin active exercises by which term is meant exercises in which the patient\u2019s own muscles are used to cause movement in the joint, sometimes directed, guided and encouraged by another person who does not apply any force himself to cause the patient\u2019s leg to flex or straighten, but merely supports the leg. He came to this decision, based on his experience with her in hospital. He recognized her as a very nervous patient who complained a great deal, and he was aware that her reaction to drugs for the relief of pain, e.g., morphine, had been most unusual as she seemed to require doses at more frequent intervals than were normal, and he was left with the impression that she had an unusual reaction to pain. For this reason he felt she would be most reluctant to flex her knee against a sensation of pain, but unless exercises were begun she might have a permanently stiff knee. Accordingly, he decided that she would benefit from assistance which the respondent Boyce could give, and he instructed Boyce to start active exercises to mobilize the knee. The respondent Boyce was not a qualified physiotherapist, and was required to follow the instructions given him by Dr. Bruser. Those instructions were given by Dr. Bruser to Boyce in writing, and Dr. Bruser was particular in specifying that no physical force was to be used and no pressure applied. Dr. Bruser testified that he instructed Boyce to be careful, and because of Mrs. Pearce\u2019s apparent low pain tolerance he had to avoid pressure. Boyce stated that his instructions with regard to Mrs. Pearce were that the exercises to get the knee moving were to be done by Mrs. Pearce \u201con her own\u201d and that his function was to support the knee and let her work it actively with her own muscle control.\nOn January 2 Boyce gave Mrs. Pearce some instruction in static contraction of the thigh muscles with no movement of the knee joint, the whole leg resting on a table or plinth. Mrs. Pearce returned for a treatment on January 4 and another treament on January 6. The third treatment was on January 11 and it was on this occasion that the knee-cap was refractured. On this date Mrs. Pearce was placed on a table in such a position that the injured leg from the knee down projected out from the table. Boyce supported the leg by placing his left hand on the thigh a little above the knee with his right hand gripping behind the heel with his thumb coming around in front of the ankle. This was intended as a new exercise in which the knee was to be flexed and straightened. As of this date Mrs. Pearce had been able to obtain a flexion of 30 degrees in the knee.\nShortly put, the established facts are that when Mrs. Pearce presented herself to Boyce for treatment on January 11 her injured knee-cap was intact. A few minutes later, while being treated by Boyce in the manner just described, the knee-cap fractured with a crack resembling the breaking of a bamboo stick. There was a great deal of medical testimony dealing with fractures of the knee-cap of this kind, but none to the effect that such a fracture would happen spontaneously with the leg at rest. Something had to occur to cause the break.\nThe appellant\u2019s contention is that Boyce was applying pressure contrary to Dr. Bruser\u2019s written instructions that no pressure was to be applied, and it was admitted by Boyce that on January 11, while guiding the movement he was applying two pounds\u2019 pressure. This was contrary to the instructions he had received from Dr. Bruser. The medical testimony established that pressure could cause pain and pain could induce an involuntary contraction of the quadriceps muscles and this involuntary contraction of the quadriceps muscles could cause the knee-cap to fracture.\nThe respondents\u2019 contention is that Mrs. Pearce was on the plinth receiving a treatment from Boyce, and being apprehensive of pain pulled her leg back, and in so doing induced a contraction of the quadriceps muscles which fractured the knee-cap.\nIt is clear that the injury occurred either by the passive pressure applied by Boyce causing pain with the result as stated or by reason of Mrs. Pearce pulling herself back on the plinth with the result as stated.\nIn view of the fact that it was established that Boyce was acting contrary to his instructions in applying passive pressure and that the injury could reasonably have resulted from that fact, it seems to me that an onus devolved upon Boyce to establish that the fracture did, in fact, occur not because he was acting contrary to instructions and applying pressure, but because Mrs. Pearce jerked backwards on the plinth, inducing the muscle contraction that caused the break.\nThe evidence fails to establish that Mrs. Pearce suddenly pulled her leg back at the instant of the break. Three persons were then present, Mrs. Pearce, her son Ralph James and Boyce. They testified on this most material point as follows:\nRALPH JAMES PEARCE:\nQ It doesn\u2019t matter, tell it in your own way.\nA Well, at first she didn\u2019t say too much, but as the exercise progressed she complained about being in pain, and through this she was a little reluctant to go on with the exercise and she tried to pull herself back up, or her leg was back on the bench, and with this Mr. Boyce\u2014I won\u2019t quote exactly what he said because I can\u2019t remember, it\u2019s quite a little while ago now\u2014but with this he was more persistent on helping her with the exercise, and he made her stay where she was doing this exercise.\nBY THE COURT:\nQ You say she pulled herself back on the plinth, is that it?\nA Yes. She was complaining that he was hurting her and she wanted to get back on, as you call it, the plinth.\nQ And you say he stopped her?\nA Yes\u2014well, he proceeded with the exercise even though she was reluctant to do so, and finally it was just a case of a little bit too much pressure, I guess, and it snapped and all you heard was a loud crack. BY MR. NEWMAN:\nQ Well, did you observe which way the leg was moving when the snap occurred?\nA It was moving in the downward motion.\nQ And where was Mr. Boyce\u2019s right hand at the time?\nA Holding on to the heel of her foot.\nQ And the left hand up?\nA Up behind the knee.\nand on cross-examination:\nQ That is she put her hands to the side of her and pulled herself back?\nA Yes.\nQ How far would you say she moved back?\nA Well, she got back to where her leg, except for about the bottom half of her leg itself, was on.\nQ Well, that is, her knee would be\u2014\nA Her knee would have been on the bench then.\nQ On the bench. That is over the edge of the plinth?\nA Yes.\nQ Which would mean that both legs would be probably straight out?\nA That\u2019s correct, yes.\nBY THE COURT:\nQ Would you say only a few inches\u2014\nA Well, there was only about, I would say, about eight, maybe ten inches of her leg over the edge of it.\nBY MR. MONK:\nQ Well, I want to be quite clear about that. That is her leg was only projecting beyond the plinth, say, a little above the ankle?\nA Oh, yes, just a little above, not much.\nQ There would be, say, six inches of her leg beyond the plinth?\nA Yes.\nQ I see. And when she was in that position what was Mr. Boyce doing?\nA He was talking to her.\nQ Talking to her. Did he have his hands touching her at all?\nA Well, he still had his hand on her heel.\nQ But was he moving the leg at all at that point?\nA No, not at that particular time. He was just trying to persuade her to come down to the end of the bench again.\nQ I see. And how long did she stay in the position she was that you described?\nA Oh, not more than a half a minute.\nQ Half a minute, and it was during that half a minute that this occurrence, that crack\u2014\nA No, sir.\nQ Well, tell us what happened.\nA Then Mr. Boyce throughout some of the conversation told her that \u201cyou had to be cruel to be kind\u201d.\nQ I see. That is exactly what he said?\nA I\u2019m not quoting, sir, now. It was pertaining to this. Q But what you believe he said, yes.\nA And he held her down to the edge of the plinth again. Even though she was reluctant I guess she was just naturally out to try to help herself as well.\nQ I see. And he helped her into what position?\nA The same position she was before she pulled herself back.\nQ That is sitting with her knee over the edge of the plinth?\nA That is correct, yes.\nQ I see. And was she attempting to move her leg?\nA I don\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t say as to whether she was attempting, but I know the leg was being moved.\nQ In what motion, up and down?\nA That\u2019s right, yes, sir.\nQ And did Mr. Boyce have his hands as you described previously?\nA Yes, sir.\nQ And how long had this occurred when the sound which you referred to, or the cracking sound, occurred?\nA Possibly a minute and a half to two minutes at the most.\nQ At the most. And at the time that the occurrence, that the cracking sound occurred, was your mother attempting to move back onto the plinth?\nA I wouldn\u2019t say so, but with the pain after the crack\u2014well, I can recall looking at her face and I knew she was in pain.\nQ But prior to the crack did she make any other movement to attempt to get back onto the plinth or further back on the plinth?\nA No, just conversation, I would say.\nQ I see. And what was the conversation, what occurred?\nA That she wanted to stop this and go home, he was hurting her. That\u2019s all.\nQ Did you say that you remembered whether this occurred on the upward or downward movement of the leg?\nA It was the downward movement.\nQ That is the leg was coming down?\nA That\u2019s correct.\nJAMES VERNON BOYCE:\nQ You were giving this treatment to Mrs. Pearce, and how long did you give it to her on this last occasion?\nA In the area of about five to ten minutes.\nQ Would this be continuously or intermittently?\nA It would be intermittently.\nQ Tell us what happened.\nA The one point I don\u2019t remember, in what direction the travel was.\nQ When you say \u201cin what direction the travel was\u201d what do you mean?\nA Whether on the downward motion or upward motion. I can\u2019t say for certain where it was. This is one thing I can\u2019t say, but I did hear a tearing sound.\nQ What occurred at that moment; what happened?\nA I believe that Mrs. Pearce did scream, which was normal reaction.\nBY THE COURT:\nQ After the tearing sound or before?\nA After the tearing sound. BY THE COURT:\nQ Before the tearing sound had she made any movement?\nA Not to my knowledge. She was working along fairly well with me.\nQ After the tearing sound what did you do and what did she do?\nA After the tearing sound I can\u2019t say for certain, I am not sure, but she was sitting back on the bench. I think she moved back but I am not sure.\nQ Do you know whether she moved back before or after the tearing sound?\nA It was after. She pulled the leg back for the support of the plinth.\n(Emphasis added.)\nMrs. Pearce\u2019s evidence was not as clear as that of her son or that of Boyce. That was to be expected in the circumstances. She was quite hysterical following the injury. However, she did testify as follows:\nQ And then what happened?\nA My knee snapped and it sounded like a bamboo stick.\nQ And then what about pain?\nA Well, it was worse than the first one I had, the first time I hit my knee on the bedpost.\nQ And what was he doing at the time the snap occurred, do you recall? Do you actually recall what he was doing at the time the snap occurred?\nA Well, as I say, he had his hand like on the ball of my heel and his other hand on the top of my knee.\nQ Do you recall whether he was moving your foot down or up when the snap occurred?\nA He was pushing it up or down.\nQ But do you recall actually at the time it snapped whether he was pulling it down or pushing it up?\nA No, I don\u2019t.\nIt is clear from the son\u2019s evidence that Mrs. Pearce moved backwards on the plinth at some time prior to the fracture and was persuaded by Boyce to permit him to resume the up and down movement. She agreed and came forward again and it was at this time, after Boyce had resumed the up and down movement under pressure that the fracture occurred.\nRespondents\u2019 contention must, I think, stand or fall principally on Boyce\u2019s evidence and that evidence just does not support the proposition that Mrs. Pearce suddenly pulled her leg back and that the fracture occurred at that moment. This being so, the only reliable theory explaining the injury is that it was caused in accordance with the learned trial judge\u2019s finding as follows:\nI find that Boyce was negligent on this occasion in applying some pressure, contrary to his instructions, to assist movement, and in not exercising as much care as was reasonably necessary under the circumstances, and that his negligence was responsible for the fracture which occurred.\nI would, accordingly, allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of Smith J.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014The reason why the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment at trial was that the inferences drawn by the learned trial judge were not supported by the evidence and the findings of fact as made by him, and that on these findings of fact there was no believable evidence to support an inference of negligence against the physiotherapist.\nI will not attempt to paraphrase the comments of the learned trial judge on the evidence of the physiotherapist and the patient. The following are verbatim extracts from his reasons for judgment:\nBoyce\u2019s evidence that he did not pull the leg down or push it up, but that the movement was due entirely to use of Mrs. Pearce\u2019s own muscles with him imposing about two pounds of resistance to the movement; that she was in fairly good spirits that day; that at no time did she complain about being in pain, or that he was being too rough, or that he was hurting her, but worked along fairly well with him within the range of movement; that there was no problem at all until the tearing sound occurred, and that it was after the tearing sound occurred that she pushed herself backward on the plinth: all this gives no credible explanation of the fracture. Even his adoption of the answers to questions put to him when he was examined for discovery, to the effect that he could have moved Mrs. Pearce\u2019s leg up and down but did not recall doing so, does not explain the accident. Nor does his admission on cross-examination that though he did not recall any conversation with Mrs. Pearce on January 11 prior to the fracture, she might have asked him if he was an old sergeant-major, she might have told him she was not a Blue Bomber, or that he was being too rough. These admissions raise doubts about the strict accuracy of his evidence, but they do not explain the accident.\nEven if all of Mrs. Pearce\u2019s evidence is accepted, it does not indicate satisfactorily how the accident occurred. She said she objected to his treatment because of the pain in the knee, that she pushed Boyce back and told him she wasn\u2019t coming back for any more treatments and that he was far too rough. Asked twice by the Court if it was very painful, her first answer was that \u201cIt was very vigorous that night\u201d and her second was \u201cYes, it was painful\u201d. She did not use the word \u201cvery\u201d in this answer. She said she then went to push herself backwards on the plinth because she could see he was going to be too vigorous, and by this time the knee had snapped. On cross-examination she said she didn\u2019t push herself away from Boyce but kind of slid back slowly as best she could, and that it wasn\u2019t a second after she made this movement that the break occurred. Questioned further, she said the two things were not almost simultaneous, and then that she didn\u2019t know whether it was less than a second after her backward movement that the break occurred. Nowhere does Mrs. Pearce\u2019s evidence suggest a sudden movement on her part or a sharp pain such as would cause a violent or even quick muscular reaction in her quadriceps.\nThe conclusions of the learned trial judge are set out in the following extracts from his reasons:\nThough none of those present said anything to this effect, I have come to the conclusion, on all the evidence, that the immediate cause of the fracture on January 11 was and can only have been a sudden contraction of Mrs. Pearce\u2019s quadriceps muscle, which was probably occasioned either by actual pain in the knee or by nervous reaction anticipating such pain. I find that during the exercise she suffered some pain which, because of her nervous condition and low pain tolerance, led her to make some complaint. I do not accept her evidence that Boyce was too rough or too vigorous. Her son said he was persistent in getting her to continue with the exercise, but he said nothing to indicate roughness or excessive vigor.\nBoyce\u2019s knowledge of Mrs. Pearce\u2019s nervous condition and reaction to pain imposed a greater duty than usual upon him to be on guard against sudden movements or muscular contractions on her part. Though he denied it at the trial, his evidence on examination-for-discovery (questions 168 and 169) indicate that he could have been moving Mrs. Pearce\u2019s leg up and down. He then said at the trial that the answers to those questions were correct to the best of his knowledge. My conclusion on this point is that he was assisting to some slight extent the upward and downward movement of Mrs. Pearce\u2019s leg. The evidence is that during this exercise his right thumb was in front of or above the ankle. If, as Mrs. Pearce\u2019s son said, the fracture occurred during the downward movement of the leg, that would be the instant when a spasm or sudden contraction of the quadriceps occurred, the effect of which would be aggravated by any downward pressure then being exerted by the grip of Boyce\u2019s right hand or by his right thumb. I consider the balance of probabilities is in favour of this being the true explanation for the accident. The medical evidence indicates that it is possible for the patella to be fractured by sudden muscular contraction alone, but it is more likely to occur if the contraction works against resistance such as I have found was being exerted by Boyce\u2019s hand or thumb. Accordingly, I find that Boyce was negligent on this occasion in applying some pressure, contrary to his instructions, to assist movement, and in not exercising as much care as was reasonably necessary under the circumstances, and that his negligence was responsible for the fracture which occurred.\nThe evidence of the medical experts for the plaintiff indicates that neither of them would go beyond saying that it was possible that the fracture might have happened as a result of the small amount of pressure Boyce was exerting upon the leg. Indeed, Dr. Mills agreed on cross\u2011examination that there were several ways in which the fracture could have happened during the period remedial exercises were being administered, and these were equally as probable as the theory that the injury occurred as a result of Boyce exerting too much pressure. Furthermore, both expert wit- nesses for the defendants gave testimony which emphatically supported the contention that Boyce had not been negligent in his administration of treatment.\nWith the evidence left as it was and with the findings of fact made by the learned trial judge, the conclusion of the Court of Appeal is, in my opinion, sound. They said:\nThe conclusion reached by the learned trial judge was, at most, an inference or theory which he evolved to explain the accident. It could only be warranted if, on the balance of probabilities, such inference or theory was justified. I think the plaintiff\u2019s case falls far short of presenting evidence adequate in clarity or strength to discharge the onus of proving negligence. The greater part of the judgment of the learned judge is to the same effect. The somewhat surprising conclusion that he reached is, with respect, not based on evidence which he clearly or unreservedly accepts; it is in almost direct contradiction of much of the medical testimony, and runs counter to the weight of the highly competent professional opinion on the record.\nI would affirm the reasons of the Court of Appeal and dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs, JUDSON J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Newman, MacLean & Associates, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Aikins, Mac-Aulay & Company, Winnipeg.\n",

As a result of a telephone call, two uniformed police officers were sent to the respondent\u2019s home. As they approached the house, the respondent shot one of them from an upstairs window. The defence of insanity was raised. In a statement admitted in evidence, the respondent said that he had planned to kill a policeman and had purchased a rifle and ammunition for that purpose. The defence called two witnesses only, the respondent\u2019s sister who testified as to the mistreatment of her brother by their father when he was a child, and a psychiatrist who saw the respondent nine months after the crime and six days before the trial. The psychiatrist expressed the opinion that the respondent had an aggressive, antisocial, impulse-ridden type of personality and was unable to cope with his homicidal or sexual impulses. The trial judge did not review the evidence of the respondent\u2019s sister or that of the psychiatrist. By a majority judgment, the Court of Appeal ordered a new trial on the ground that there had been non-direction as to the defence of insanity amounting to misdirection. The Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the verdict at the trial restored.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.: After considering all the evidence that had any relevance to the defence of insanity and in the particular circumstances of this case, the charge on this branch of the matter, considered as it must be in the light of all the evidence in the record, was sufficient in law and more favourable to the respondent than it could have been if the trial judge had made a detailed analysis of the psychiatrist\u2019s evidence. The Court of Appeal should, therefore, have rejected the ground of appeal on which it based its judgment.\nThe Court of Appeal found it unnecessary to consider the other grounds of appeal alleged in the notice of appeal or disclosed by the record, as it had the jurisdiction to do under s. 583A(3) of the Criminal Code. In these circumstances, this Court has the power to make a final disposition of the appeal. A consideration of any other defence leads to the conclusion that the trial was conducted with scrupulous fairness to the respondent, that in its course there was no error in law, that no valid exception could be taken to the charge of the trial judge and that the verdict was fully supported by the evidence. There was no need to invoke the provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) of the Code.\nPer Hall and Spence JJ., dissenting: The trial judge misdirected the jury on the defence of insanity in that he failed to instruct them that there was evidence that the respondent was suffering from a disease of the mind, and while an irresistible impulse was not of itself a defence the evidence that the irresistible impulse was a manifestation of a disease of the mind was evidence to be considered by them in the light of the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony. Furthermore, the trial judge should have reviewed in part what the psychiatrist had said and how the law as to insanity as a defence should be applied to the facts as the jury found them. If there is medical evidence of disease of the mind as there was here and yet the only symptoms of that disease are irresistible impulses, the jury may conclude that the accused is insane. The evidence of irresistible impulse is also relevant to the issue of whether the accused is capable of appreciating the nature and quality of the act. A man operating under an irresistible impulse may have knowledge of the nature and quality of his act without appreciating its nature and quality. In failing to point out to the jury that the theory of the defence was that the respondent had a disease of the mind and that the irresistible impulse was the manifestation of that disease, the trial judge failed to put the theory of the defence adequately to the jury. The provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) of the Code should not be invoked. This Court has the jurisdiction to do what the Court of Appeal was required to do by s. 583A(3) of the Code.

La d\u00e9fense d\u2019ali\u00e9nation mentale a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e. Dans une d\u00e9claration admise en preuve, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a dit qu\u2019il avait projet\u00e9 de tuer un agent de police et que pour ce faire il avait achet\u00e9 un fusil et des balles. La d\u00e9fense a fait entendre deux t\u00e9moins seulement, la s\u0153ur de l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 des mauvais traitements inflig\u00e9s par leur p\u00e8re \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait un enfant, et un psychiatre qui a vu l\u2019intim\u00e9 neuf mois apr\u00e8s le crime et six jours avant le proc\u00e8s. Le phychiatre a exprim\u00e9 l\u2019opinion que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait une personnalit\u00e9 agressive, antisocial, men\u00e9e par ses impulsions et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait incapable de repousser ses impulsions meurtri\u00e8res ou sexuelles. Le juge au proc\u00e8s n\u2019a pas pass\u00e9 en revue le t\u00e9moignage de la s\u0153ur de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou celui du psychiatre. La Cour d\u2019appel, par un jugement majoritaire, a ordonn\u00e9 un nouveau proc\u00e8s pour le motif qu\u2019il y avait eu, quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense d\u2019ali\u00e9nation mentale, un manque de directives \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 une mauvaise directive.

Dans ces circonstances, cette Cour a le pouvoir de disposer finalement de l\u2019appel. Un examen des autres d\u00e9fenses m\u00e8ne \u00e0 la conclusion que le proc\u00e8s a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu avec une impartialit\u00e9 scrupuleuse, qu\u2019il ne s\u2019est produit aucune erreur en droit, qu\u2019on ne peut s\u2019objecter validement aux directives du juge et que la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait amplement support\u00e9e par la preuve. Il n\u2019y a aucune n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019invoquer les dispositions de l\u2019art. 592(1)(b)(iii) du Code.\nLes Juges Hall et Spence, dissidents: Le juge au proc\u00e8s a donn\u00e9 des mauvaises directives quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense d\u2019ali\u00e9nation mentale, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il ne leur a pas dit qu\u2019il y avait une preuve que l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait atteint d\u2019une maladie mentale, et quoiqu\u2019une impulsion irr\u00e9sistible n\u2019est pas en soi une d\u00e9fense la preuve que l\u2019impulsion irr\u00e9sistible est une manifestation d\u2019une maladie mentale est une preuve que le jury devait consid\u00e9rer \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du t\u00e9moignage du psychiatre. De plus, le juge aurait d\u00fb examiner en partie ce que le psychiatre avait dit et expliquer comment la loi concernant l\u2019ali\u00e9nation mentale comme d\u00e9fense doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e aux faits tels que d\u00e9termin\u00e9s par le jury. S\u2019il existe une preuve m\u00e9dicale d\u2019une maladie mentale, comme c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas, et cependant les seuls sympt\u00f4mes de cette maladie sont des impulsions irr\u00e9sistibles, le jury peut en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019accus\u00e9 est un ali\u00e9n\u00e9. La preuve d\u2019impulsion irr\u00e9sistible est de plus pertinente \u00e0 la question de savoir si l\u2019accus\u00e9 est capable de juger la nature et la qualit\u00e9 de l\u2019acte. Un homme agissant sous des impulsions irr\u00e9sistibles peut bien conna\u00eetre la nature et la qualit\u00e9 de son acte sans en appr\u00e9cier la nature et la qualit\u00e9. En omettant de faire observer au jury que la th\u00e9orie de la d\u00e9fense \u00e9tait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait atteint d\u2019une maladie mentale et que l\u2019impulsion irr\u00e9sistible \u00e9tait la manifestation de cette maladie, le juge au proc\u00e8s a omis de placer ad\u00e9quatement devant le jury la th\u00e9orie de la d\u00e9fense. Les dispositions de l\u2019art. 592(1)(b)(iii) du Code ne doivent pas \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9es.

Appel accueilli.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division1, which had ordered a new trial. Appeal allowed.\nJ.W.K. Shortreed, Q.C., for the appellant.\nG.A.C. Steer, Q.C., and G.A. Verville for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal, brought pursuant to s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division1, pronounced on October 31, 1968, setting aside a verdict of guilty of capital murder and directing a new trial. Allen J.A., dissenting, would have dismissed the appeal.\nThe respondent was tried before Milvain J., as he then was, and a jury. The verdict was rendered on April 11, 1968. The respondent was sentenced to death.\nThere is no dispute as to the facts surrounding the actual killing. On June 23, 1967, as a result of a telephone call made at about 2.40 p.m. to the detachment office of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at Grande Prairie, Alberta, Corporal Harvey and Corporal Biggar drove from the detachment office to a residence known as 1006 103rd St., in an area of the City of Grande Prairie described as Bear Creek Flats. Both were dressed in the uniform of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. They enquired at that address as to the location of the residence of Leonard Otto Borg and Harvey Lambert, an occupant of the house, came out to show them where Borg lived. Borg lived in an apartment above a double garage to the rear and slightly to one side of the residence mentioned. Lambert, Corporal Biggar and Corporal Harvey walked past the front of that residence and turned into a driveway leading to Borg\u2019s apartment. They had walked about twelve feet along the driveway towards Borg\u2019s residence when a head appeared at an open window near the southeast corner of the apartment and a shot was heard. Corporal Harvey clutched the upper part of his body and fell to the ground. Corporal Biggar drew his revolver, fired one shot into the ground, then obtained some assistance and moved Harvey out of the line of fire. Harvey was mortally wounded and died in a short time, undoubtedly as a result of the wound caused by the bullet fired through the open window.\nWhen Corporal Biggar fired into the ground the head in the window disappeared. A very short time later Corporal Biggar saw what he believed to be the same head appear at the same open window and he fired his revolver towards the head. He saw \u201cthe head come up and appear to fall back\u201d. Corporal Biggar radioed to the detachment office for assistance. He could then see no movement in the house and he fired another shot into the ground immediately in front of him. He then heard a voice coming from inside the building \u201cIf I throw my gun out you won\u2019t shoot, will you?\u201d. Corporal Biggar said he wouldn\u2019t and told the man to stand up where he could see him. A hand with a rifle came over the windowsill and the rifle dropped to the ground. The man inside said there was no door on the front and that the Corporal would have to go to the back. The Corporal went to the back and told the man to come out with his hands up; the man, who was Borg, did so and was placed under arrest; he was found to have been shot and slightly wounded in one ear.\nFollowing a voir dire, the learned trial judge admitted in evidence portions of a statement written and signed by the respondent and two questions out of several asked of him by Corporal Dillabaugh and his answers thereto.\nThese are as follows:\nI then slept till 9 a.m. Went down town and bought a cil. 22 for $19.80 and one box of .22 long. I came back home and made a phone call to the RCMP. I didn\u2019t give them\u2026\n(Here a sentence is omitted.)\n\u2026I later went up town at 1 am and had one drink of Vodka strate and one ry and water I came home about 2 30 am and made a phone call to the RCMP telling them where I lived When the police arrived I shot one in the chest some ware around the heart, at least thats where I was aiming shortly after that the second police man shot at me hitting me in the left ear it knocked me to the floor I then thought whats the use. I caused enough grief in my life. I then gave myself up.\n(It is obvious, and was agreed by counsel, that \u201c1 am\u201d and \u201c2 30 am\u201d should have read \u201c1 p.m.\u201d and \u201c2.30 p.m.\u201d).\nThe questions and answers were as follows:\nQue. When you made the phone call to the R.C.M. Police & told them who you were & where they might find you, did you at that time plan to kill a policeman when he came to see you?\nAns. I planned to kill a policeman before that, before I ever went up town to buy the gun.\nQue. Just when did you first plan to kill a policeman?\nAns. My plan to kill a policeman first came into my mind while I was doing 3 years in the B.C. pen for something I didn\u2019t do.\nThere is evidence confirming the purchase of the rifle and ammunition on the 23rd June 1967. Ammunition of the type purchased was found in the respondent\u2019s apartment in several places. Some blood was splattered upon the floor in the vicinity of the open window and there were quite substantial amounts of blood upon the respondent\u2019s shirt.\nIt should be explained why portions only of the written statement and the questions and answers were read to the jury.\nOn the voir dire there had been filed as Exhibit V.D. 5, three documents, (i) a lengthy statement in the handwriting of the respondent headed, \u201cTo whom it may concern\u201d, (ii) a short letter commencing \u201cMom Dad and Kinfolk\u201d and (iii) a short document intended to be the respondent\u2019s will. These documents had been found by Staff Sergeant Chalk, at about 3.10 p.m. on the day of the killing of Corporal Harvey, in a sealed envelope in the apartment occupied by the respondent from which the fatal shot was fired. At the time when these documents were found, the respondent was in a police car outside the building. In the apartment was the dead body of a woman. It seems obvious that the three documents were written by the respondent between the time when he killed the woman and the arrival of Corporal Harvey and Corporal Biggar.\nBetween 10.15 p.m. and 11.45 p.m. on June 23, 1967, the respondent made a lengthy statement to Corporal Dillabaugh and Constable Fischer. This statement was written and signed by the respondent. It was filed as Exhibit V.D. 3 on the voir dire. It described in considerable detail the killing of a woman by the respondent on December 21, 1966, and the burning by him of the shack in which her dead body lay with the result that her death was held to have been accidental. It went on to describe the killing of another woman by the respondent in the early morning hours of June 23, 1967, stating that she was dead about 3 a.m. Immediately following this point in the statement were the words:\u2014\u201cI wrote a letter detailing my part\u201d. This letter would appear to be item (i) in Exhibit V.D. 5 mentioned above. This sentence immediately preceded the portion of the statement which was read to the jury and which has been quoted above. The \u201csentence omitted\u201d indicated in the quoted statement, read as follows:\nI just told them that I had murdered my wife, I didn\u2019t give them any details of the place at the time for I was not sure of my plans.\nFollowing the making of this written statement by the respondent, he was asked several questions by Corporal Dillabaugh. These questions and answers of the respondent were taken down in writing and were signed by the accused and this document was marked as Exhibit V.D. 4.\nThe two questions and answers read to the jury have been quoted above.\nIt would seem that both counsel at the trial were of the view that, although the learned trial judge had ruled that the statements made by the accused were voluntary, it would be unfair to the accused to show that he had killed two persons other than the one with whose murder he was charged and that after discussion, in the absence of the jury, some of which appears to have taken place in the judge\u2019s chambers, counsel agreed, with the approval of the learned trial judge, as to what should be read to the jury.\nIn taking this course I presume the learned trial judge and counsel had in mind the rule of conduct referred to in such cases as Noor Mohamed v. The King[2], that evidence, although legally admissible, should not be tendered if the prejudice to the accused would far outweigh its probative value relevant to the issue before the Court.\nIn my opinion, so far as the statement, V.D. 3, the questions and answers, V.D. 4 and the documents contained in Exhibit V.D. 5 were tendered to show that the accused had murdered Corporal Harvey it may well have been proper to exclude the portions which were withheld from the jury; but it appears to me that they were all clearly relevant to the issue of the defense of insanity and on that issue could properly have been put before the jury in their entirety. However, in view of the course taken at the trial, I propose in deciding how this appeal should be disposed of to consider only the evidence actually placed before the jury.\nIn the course of his reasons the learned Chief Justice of Alberta, who delivered the judment of the majority of the Appellate Division, after summarizing the facts surrounding the shooting of Corporal Harvey, said that it was established beyond any room for doubt (i) that the shooting was the act of the respondent and (ii) that his act amounted to capital murder and consequently that the only defence open to the respondent was that of insanity under s. 16 of the Criminal Code. I agree with this statement; it is supported by conclusive and uncontradicted evidence.\nThe only issue discussed before us and the only one of any substance in this case is that regarding the defence of insanity. The ground on which the majority of the Appellate Division allowed the appeal is summarized in the formal judgment as follows:\nAND UPON this Honourable Court finding that the learned trial Judge failed to review the substantial parts of the evidence of Mrs. Hartman and Dr. Spaner and to instruct the jury as to how the law was to be applied to the facts as they found them and thereby misdirected the jury by such non-direction.\nThe only evidence at the trial called by the defence was that of Mrs. Hartman, a sister of the accused, and Dr. Spaner, a medical practitioner specializing in psychiatry whose qualifications were not questioned. Their evidence related entirely to the defence of insanity.\nThe Crown called no evidence in reply.\nThe evidence of Mrs. Hartman is sufficiently summarized by Bruce Smith C.J.A. as follows:\nMrs. Hartman gave a very detailed description of her and the appellant\u2019s life at home as children. She said he had been persecuted, beaten and abused by his father and unnecessarily mistreated in many ways; that he had been shown no affection by his father; that he would be given conflicting instructions by his father and then brutally punished because he did not properly carry out the instructions; that his father cheated him out of a trap line when he became older. She said that on one occasion, after he had left home, he returned and was very mixed up and acting strangely. She said that he was \u2018sitting there sharpening a knife and looking at me\u2019 and that she was afraid and got an iron and a knife with which to protect herself. On another occasion, at the time of Mrs. Hartman\u2019s wedding, the appellant didn\u2019t remember where he had been for five days. She said his only association was with Metis women, not white girls, and that he didn\u2019t feel good enough for white girls.\nDr. Spaner interviewed the accused at Fort Saskatchewan gaol on April 2, 1968, that is six days before the commencement of the trial and a little over nine months after the killing of Corporal Harvey. The interview lasted between 2\u00bd and 3 hours. Dr. Spaner heard the evidence of Mrs. Hartman and the portions of the accused\u2019s statement and answers that were read to the jury. It was from these materials that he formed his opinion.\nAs was pointed out by Bruce Smith C.J.A., Dr. Spaner nowhere in his evidence expressed the opinion, in so many words, that the accused at the time he shot Corporal Harvey did not know that what he was doing was contrary to law or that he was incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of his act. The learned Chief Justice was, however, of the view that either of these conclusions could be founded on Dr. Spaner\u2019s evidence if accepted. With the greatest respect I cannot agree with this.\nIt appears to me that if the view of Dr. Spaner\u2019s evidence most favourable to the accused were taken by the jury it could be said to show, (i) that Borg was suffering from a disease of the mind called a psychopathic state and that he fitted into the classification of the aggressive, anti-social, impulse-ridden type of personality, (ii) that he had very few healthy coping mechanisms or ways of defending himself against impulses such as homicidal or sexual ones, (iii) that this lack of impulse control is chronic, (iv) that a major characteristic of this impulse type of personality is being emotionally unbalanced by the illness, that the moral issues cannot be differentiated, that he does not have the moral ethical part of his mind functioning most of his life but \u201cmost important of all he can have normal cognitive functioning\u2014that is the knowing part of his mind functioning\u201d, (v) that the impulse is so powerful his judgment is impaired but he can still have intellectual functioning, (vi) that the effect of alcohol is unpredictable; it can wipe away any controls or it might even calm him; it is impossible to say, (vii) that Borg hates authoritarian figures and under the influence of his anti-social impulse driven, aggressive impulses, he can kill, (viii) that if the force of the impulse cannot be resisted \u201cat that moment\u201d, and this is a symptom of what he suffers from\u2014an impulse\u2014psychotic state\u2014an irresistible impulse when he neither reasons nor deliberates, (ix) that the irresistible impulse is both a symptom of the disease of the mind and the disease itself, (x) that he operates sometimes with normal intellect, sometimes with a little better than normal intellect and sometimes like a little boy.\nAn important answer made by Dr. Spaner in the course of his cross-examination was as follows:\nQue. You are unable to say with any degree of accuracy whether or not the drink of rye\u2014the drink of vodka straight and the rye and water, aggravated any\u2014what\u2014first of all I would gather you are unable to say what particular emotional condition he was in at the time.\nAns. No, I just thought he\u2014that the circumstances that were going on, that it was quite possible that he was anxiety ridden, panic stricken, under the influence or some catastrophic disorganization. It appears to me that the effect of Dr. Spaner\u2019s evidence is that, in his opinion, at the time of the shooting Borg may have been acting under an irresistible impulse such as the Doctor had described. There is no evidence that Borg himself had that view and the portions of his statement and of his answers read to the jury far from suggesting anything in the nature of an impulsive action indicate a careful and deliberate plan which it took him some hours to carry out. The actions and statements of Borg after the shooting indicate that he was well aware of what he had done and that it was wrong. The evidence taken as a whole falls far short of being sufficient to satisfy the onus of proof on the balance of probabilities which rests on the defence when insanity is alleged.\nThe only evidence given on the last day of the trial was that of Mrs. Hartman followed by that of Dr. Spaner. It would be fresh in the minds of the jury when they heard the judge\u2019s charge. That charge in so far as it dealt with the law regarding insanity was clear and correct. The learned trial judge did not analyze or summarize the evidence of Mrs. Hartman or that of Dr. Spaner but he did say:\nNow in this case I suggest that you can bear in mind as you weigh the entire evidence in this regard, many things: you bear in mind, of course, the evidence that was given by the accused\u2019s sister of his background and life; you bear in mind what we have learned of the man through the statements, or, to the extent that the statement is before you, and we bear in mind the evidence that was given by Dr. Spaner. All of those things together form the evidence that you consider.\n* * *\nYou weigh in your minds the whole of the evidence that you have heard because it is your province and your province alone to conclude whether or not, on a balance of probabilities, the accused has satisfied you that he was insane within the meaning of the Act that I read you, and if he has done so, of course, your verdict then would be not guilty but insane.\nIt would seem to me, gentlemen, in viewing the whole of this case, when you retire to consider your verdict, there are three possible verdicts within the law. One verdict could, of course, be guilty as charged; he could be found not guilty at all, or he could be found not guilty because of insanity. Those appear to me to be the only three possible verdicts.\nIt is not surprising that the learned and experienced counsel for the defence did not request the judge to give a further charge involving a detailed examination of the Doctor\u2019s evidence. Such a request, if acceded to, would have resulted in the judge having to point out to the jury how far the evidence fell short of indicating that the accused was other than sane at the time of the shooting.\nAfter considering all the evidence that had any relevance to the defence of insanity I am satisfied that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the charge on this branch of the matter, considered as it must be in the light of all the evidence in the record, was sufficient in law and more favourable to the accused than it could have been if the judge had made a detailed analysis of Dr. Spaner\u2019s evidence before the jury.\nFor these reasons I am, with respect, of opinion that the Appellate Division should have rejected the ground of appeal on which it based its judgment and, so far as that ground is concerned, should have dismissed Borg\u2019s appeal.\nThis, however, is not the end of the matter. When the appeal came before the Appellate Division the duty of that Court was prescribed by subs. 3 of s. 583A of the Criminal Code which reads as follows:\n(3) The court of appeal, on an appeal pursuant to this section, shall\n(a) consider any ground of appeal alleged in the notice of appeal, if any notice has been given, and\n(b) consider the record to ascertain whether there are present any other grounds upon which the conviction ought to be set aside or the sentence varied, as the case may be.\nThe Appellate Division having come to the conclusion that the supposed defects in the charge of the learned trial judge to the jury relating to the defence of insanity necessitated the quashing of the conviction and the ordering of a new trial, it became unnecessary for that Court to consider, and consequently it did not consider, any grounds of appeal alleged in the Notice of Appeal or which might have been ascertained by a consideration of the record as required by clause (b), quoted above, other than the ground on which it decided to allow the appeal.\nIn these circumstances I have reached the conclusion that the duty cast upon the Appellate Division by s. 583A(3) devolves upon this Court and, while I do not doubt our power to do so, it is my opinion that it would not be proper for us to refer the matter back to the Appellate Division to consider all possible grounds of appeal other than the one upon which the judgment of that Court was based.\nThe question of our power to make a final disposition of the appeal appears to me to be settled by the decision of this Court in The Queen v. McKay[3]. In that case McKay had been convicted before LeBel J. and a jury on the charge that he and others being armed with offensive weapons did unlawfully assault one Robson with intent to rob. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was allowed by a judgment of the majority, Laidlaw and MacKay JJ.A., on the ground of law that there was no evidence to go to the jury, the conviction was accordingly quashed and a verdict of acquittal directed; Hogg J.A., dissenting, held that there was legal evidence against McKay upon which the jury were entitled to find him guilty. On appeal by the Crown to this Court the majority, Kerwin, Taschereau, Kellock and Fauteux JJ., held that Hogg J.A. was right in law and that the appeal should be allowed.\nHowever, McKay in his Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeal had asked leave to appeal on questions of fact. The Court of Appeal after deciding that there was no evidence to go to the jury had not proceeded to determine whether, even if there was such evidence, the verdict should be set aside as unreasonable. Kerwin J., as he then was, dissenting in this regard, was of opinion that the proper order to be made in these circumstances on an appeal by the Crown (which he differentiated from an appeal by the accused) was to remit the case to the Court of Appeal in order that it might, if leave had been given or should be given, pass upon the question as to whether the verdict was unreasonable in the light of all the evidence. This view was decisively rejected in the judgment of the other members of the Court who formed the majority, which was delivered by my brother Fauteux.\nAfter quoting, in abbreviated form, s. 1024 of the Criminal Code, as then in force, and s. 46 of the Supreme Court Act as follows:\n1024. The Supreme Court of Canada shall make such rule or order thereon, either in affirmance of a conviction or for granting a new trial, or otherwise\u2026 as the justice of the case requires. 46. The Court may\u2026 give the judgment\u2026 which the court whose decision is appealed against, should have given\u2026\nFauteux J. examined a number of authorities and continued, at pp. 6 and 7:\nIt is true that in each of these cases, the appeal, contrary to what is the situation in the present instance, was entered by the accused and not by the Crown. But the suggestion that this difference as to the person appealing calls for a distinction in law as to the powers of this Court finds, in my respectful view, no support, either in the enactments defining them or in the above judicial pronouncements interpreting such enactments.\n* * *\nOn an exhaustive review of the evidence, it does not appear that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable.\nIn this view, it would not, in my opinion, be consonant with the diligence required in the proper administration of justice in criminal matters to return this case to the Court of Appeal in order that it may pass on that question, i.e., whether the verdict is unreasonable, which this Court is in as good a position as the former to determine.\nThe power given to this Court by s. 600(1) of the Criminal Code, now in force, is at least as wide as that conferred by s. 1024 above referred to. It reads:\n600. (1) The Supreme Court of Canada may, on an appeal under this Part, make any order that the court of appeal might have made and may make any rule or order that is necessary to give effect to its judgment.\nHaving formed the opinion that we have the necessary authority to make a final disposition of this case and that, to use the words quoted above, \u201cit would not be consonant with the diligence required in the proper administration of justice in criminal matters\u201d to do otherwise, I have not only considered every ground set out in the Notice of Appeal to the Appellate Division and those referred to in the reasons delivered in that Court but I have read with care the whole of the record to ascertain whether there are present any other grounds upon which the conviction ought to be set aside.\nAs a result, I have reached the conclusion that the trial was conducted throughout with scrupulous fairness to the accused, that in its course there was no error in law, that no valid exception could be taken to the charge of the learned trial judge to the jury and that the verdict was fully supported by the evidence. I am satisfied that there are no grounds upon which the conviction ought to be set aside. Because there was some discussion in argument as to the possible application of the provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code, which enacts that even where there has been error in law at the trial the Court of Appeal may dismiss an appeal against a conviction if of opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred, I wish to make it clear that I am not basing my conclusion in any way upon that clause; there is no need to invoke it.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Appellate Division and restore the verdict at the trial.\nThe judgment of Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nHALL J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts are fully set out in the reasons of my brother the Chief Justice. The only real defence which was being put forward at the trial on behalf of Borg was that of insanity. The fact of the killing of the police officer was not in dispute. It was admitted in Borg\u2019s confession and proved conclusively by the verbal testimony and that fact was recognized in the reasons of the learned Chief Justice of Alberta.\nWith deference to contrary opinion, I would dismiss the appeal. As I see it, the learned trial judge misdirected the jury on the defence of insanity in that he failed to instruct them that there was evidence that Borg was suffering from a disease of the mind, and while an irresistible impulse was not of itself a defence the evidence that the irresistible impulse was a manifestation of a disease of the mind was evidence to be considered by them in the light of Dr. Spaner\u2019s testimony.\nI think, too, that the learned trial judge should have reviewed in part what Dr. Spaner had said and how the law as to insanity as a defence should be applied to the facts as they found them. The law in this regard is clear. In Azoulay v. The Queen[4], Taschereau J. (as he then was) said:\nOn the second point, I agree with the Chief Justice of the Court of King\u2019s Bench. The rule which has been laid down, and consistently followed is that in a jury trial the presiding judge must, except in rare cases where it would be needless to do so, review the substantial parts of the evidence, and give the jury the theory of the defence, so that they may appreciate the value and effect of that evidence, and how the law is to be applied to the facts as they find them. (Spencer v. Alaska Parkers, (1905) 35 Can. S.C.R. 362.) As Kellock J.A. (as he then was) said in Rex v. Stephen et al, (1944) O.R. 339 at 352: \u201cIt is not sufficient that the whole evidence be left to the jury in bulk for valuation.\u201d The pivotal questions upon which the defence stands must be clearly presented to the jury\u2019s mind. Of course, it is not necessary that the trial judge should review all the facts, and that his charge be a minute record of the evidence adduced, but as Rivard, J.A. said in Vincent v. Regem, Q.R. (1932) 52 K.B. 38 at 46: (Emphasis added)\nIl faut admettre que l\u2019adresse du juge est plut\u00f4t br\u00e8ve et que, tant sur les faits que sur les questions de droit, il n\u2019a dit que l\u2019essentiel, sans d\u00e9veloppement. Mais la question n\u2019est pas de savoir si le juge a \u00e9t\u00e9 court; il faut rechercher plut\u00f4t s\u2019il a omis le n\u00e9cessaire.\nRegarding the defence of insanity, the learned trial judge said to the jury:\nNow then, the defence say assuming that all of this is found to be so as to fact, or a set of facts, that it was in fact the accused who fired the shot that killed Harvey and that Harvey was a policeman within the meaning of the section I read you, in the course of his duty, assuming all those things were found, and that the shot killed him, that he is not guilty of the charge against him because he was at that time insane. It is a defence of insanity. Now, I must say to you in that regard that where the defence places before you a defence of insanity, I must instruct you, as best I can, of the law that lies behind such defence.\nI think I should say to you at the outset that it is not all forms of insanity which furnish a defence according to law. It is only that type of insanity which carries with it certain attributes that will furnish a defence at law, and I refer you immediately to Section 16 of the Criminal Code because it is from this section that the law we are about to consider, comes, and Section 16 says this:\n\u201cNo person shall be convicted of an offence in respect of an act or omission on his part while he was insane.\u201d\nSection 2:\n\u201cFor the purposes of this section a person is insane when he is in a state of natural imbecility or has disease of the mind to an extent that renders him incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of an act or omission or of knowing that an act or omission is wrong.\u201d\nThen I think I should tell you the provisions of subsection (3) because they may apply. It says:\n\u201cA person who has specific delusions, but is in other respects sane, shall not be acquitted on the ground of insanity unless the delusions caused him to believe in the existence of a state of things that, if it existed, would have justified or excused his act or omission.\u201d\nAnd then subsection (4) of that section is of extreme importance because it says this:\n\u201cEvery one shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to be and to have been sane.\u201d\nIn other words, when we come to a defence of insanity, the accused person starts off with a presumption at law that he is sane, and the obligation rests on him to prove that he is insane within the meaning of this section, before it will serve him as a defence. Now, I told you at the outset that the Crown was under an obligation to prove all that it must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt. But when the accused is called upon to establish insanity the obligation of proof is not that of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, it is proof by a preponderance of evidence. In other words, it establishes a set of facts from which the reasonable probability or the preponderance of probabilities points towards insanity, and that is to say, insanity within the meaning of this section, and it is only proof to that extent that the accused is called upon to establish, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\nNow, I must tell you that at law a so called irresistible or uncontrollable impulse of itself is not a defence within the meaning of this Act unless that uncontrollable or irresistible movement or impulse stems from the existence of insanity as defined here, and when one looks to the reasonable rationality of it, it becomes so obvious why it is that a mere irresistible and uncontrollable impulse is not a defence. Because everybody would get such impulses with respect to any offence. The man who breaks a jeweller\u2019s window to steal a diamond, has an irresistible impulse to do it, and, therefore, is acquitted on the ground of insanity if one is guided by this mere proposition of irresistible impulse. It must be as this section says and I repeat it to you:\n\u201cFor the purpose of this section a person is insane when he is in a state of natural imbecility\u201d\nnow there is no suggestion of that here\u2014\n\u201cor has disease of the mind to an extent that renders him incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of an act or omission or of knowing that an act or omission is wrong.\u201d\nNow in this case I suggest that you can bear in mind as you weigh the entire evidence in this regard many things: you bear in mind, of course, the evidence that was given by the accused\u2019s sister of his background and life; you bear in mind what we have learned of the man through the statements, or, to the extent that the statement is before you, and we bear in mind the evidence that was given by Dr. Spaner. All of those things together form the evidence that you consider.\nI explain to you that the evidence of an expert is merely evidence. Just because an expert says that something is so, doesn\u2019t mean that it is. The evidence of experts is weighed along with all other evidence. An expert\u2019s evidence, by a jury or by a Judge, for that matter, can be accepted in whole or disregarded in whole or accepted in part and disregarded in part. There is no complete sanctity of evidence because it has been given by an expert.\nBut the thing that strikes me as being of importance to consider, you may not think so, but I think you should bear it in mind, is that in the statement which the accused gave to the police and to the extent that it\u2019s before you, he winds up by saying, he speaks of having been hit by the bullet which the police officer fired at him; he says \u201cIt knocked me to the floor. I then thought what\u2019s the use, I caused enough grief in my life and then gave myself up.\u201d\nThis is at least some indication gentlemen, as to whether or not the mind of the accused was such that he appreciated the nature and quality of his act and as to whether or not it was wrong, and these things never are conclusive one direction or another, but it is evidence of some weight to consider.\nYou weigh in your minds the whole of the evidence that you have heard because it is your province and your province alone to conclude whether or not, on a balance of probabilities, the accused has satisfied you that he was insane within the meaning of the Act that I read you, and if he has done so, of course, your verdict then would be not guilty but insane.\nAs will be seen, his only reference to the evidence of Dr. Spaner is in the paragraph:\nNow in this case I suggest that you can bear in mind as you weigh the entire evidence in this regard, many things: you bear in mind, of course, the evidence that was given by the accused\u2019s sister of his background and life; you bear in mind what we have learned of the man through the statements, or, to the extent that the statement is before you, and we bear in mind the evidence that was given by Dr. Spaner. All of those things together form the evidence that you consider.\n(Emphasis added)\nThere were parts of Dr. Spaner\u2019s evidence which should have been drawn to the jury\u2019s attention as they related specifically to whether, when Borg killed Constable Donald Archibald Harvey, he was incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of his act or of knowing that it was wrong. Dr. Spaner had testified in chief as follows:\nI felt that Leonard Borg was suffering from a mental illness, or a disease of the mind which is called a psychopathic state. There are many types of psychopathic states, and he fits into the classification of the aggressive, anti-social, impulse ridden type of personality. Another name for a psychopath is a personality disorder. (Emphasis added)\n* * *\nQ. Now, he has there stated that when the officers came, he shot one of them. In your opinion how was Borg\u2019s mind operating at this time? A. Well, in view of what I said at the very beginning, the impulse to kill can be operating right side by side with the\u2014with the knowing part of his mind.\nQ. Yes, and in your opinion how strong is this impulse? A. I don\u2019t think that the knowing part played any part at the moment the impulse comes up. It is swept aside.\nQ. Pardon? A. It\u2019s swept aside.\nQ. What is swept aside? A. The knowing part.\nQ. The knowing part\u2014? A. Of his mind.\nQ. And when you say that, would you clarify it for us, doctor? A. I mean the impulse is the force that is operating. I would say to the exclusion of everything else.\nQ. In the situation in which he found himself\u2014and as he has said, he shot one of these men\u2014is he able\u2014. A. I missed a word there. Is he what?\nQ. Is he able\u2014and I\u2019m going to ask you not to answer until my friend has a chance to say something, if he so wishes\u2014is he able to resist\u2014I will put it\u2014yes, all right, go ahead. A. Is it all right to answer? MR. MCGURK: IS he able to resist the impulse?\nMR. STEER: Yes.\nMR. MCGURK: I have objection.\nMR. STEER: Go ahead\u2014with His Lordship\u2019s permission.\nTHE COURT: Very good. A. My opinion is that the force of that impulse cannot be resisted at that moment.\nQ. MR. STEER: Now, this irresistible impulse which you have described, is this a symptom of a disease of the mind, or is it the disease of the mind itself. A. I would say both.\nQ. Pardon? A. Would you mind repeating the question?\nQ. What I am trying to find out is: is this a symptom, this impulse, is it a symptom of something in Borg\u2019s mind? A. The answer to that part is yes, it is a symptom of what he suffers from, an impulse\u2014psychopathic state.\nQ. How far had this disease of the mind that you have described, progressed in Borg at this time? A. Well, I don\u2019t think there was any\u2014much of anything else operating except the impulse to kill.\nQ. How would this impulse that you have described affect Borg\u2019s mind as to knowing whether he was doing anything wrong? A. I think I said before, the moral issues of right and wrong are not operating at\u2014when the impulse is at a certain intensity. That part of the mind is not operating.\nQ. Now, had the impulse at this time as far as Borg is concerned reached that degree of intensity in your opinion, or had it not? A. Oh, I think by this time it had reached that height.\nQ. Intensity? A. Yes.\nQ. What is your opinion as to whether Borg could reason about this act which has been described, or which has been read to the jury? A. He wasn\u2019t reasoning at all. He was under the influence of this powerful force, or this irresistible impulse\u2014or if it was, it was so insignificant that as far as I am concerned, it didn\u2019t play any part.\nQ. Now, one other question, doctor: what is your opinion as to whether the act he has described was a considered act? A. Does that mean deliberate? That he deliberated?\nQ. Yes. A. At the height of the impulse there is no deliberation.\nand on cross-examination:\nQ. Doctor, your opinion is that this irresistible\u2014this impulse which can at its height be absolutely over-powering, is a symptom of a disease, and not a disease itself? A. It is the most characteristic symptom of the disease, yes. It is a symptom of a disease.\nThe learned trial judge\u2019s statement:\nNow, I must tell you that at law a so called irresistible or uncontrollable impulse of itself is not a defence within the meaning of this Act unless that uncontrollable or irresistible movement or impulse stems from the existence of insanity as defined here\u2026\nalthough an accurate statement of the law, was misleading in the context on the case. In order for the defence of insanity to be established, the defence must prove on the balance of probabilities two propositions: (1) that the accused was suffering from a disease of the mind; and (2) that the disease rendered the accused incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of the act or knowing that the act is wrong. When an accused pleads insanity there is a sense in which it is true to say that irresistible impulse of itself is not a defence. However, there are two senses in which it is not true to say that irresistible impulse of itself is not a defence.\nThere is no legal presumption of insanity merely from the existence of an irresistible impulse. If an accused presents no medical evidence of disease of the mind but merely pleads that he was acting under an irresistible impulse, a jury is not entitled to infer that the man was insane. In that sense irresistible impulse is not of itself a defence. However, if there is medical evidence of disease of the mind as there was here and yet the only symptoms of that disease of the mind are irresistible impulses, the jury may conclude that the accused is insane. This specific point was dealt with by Lord Tucker in Attorney-General for South Australia v. Brown[5], when, speaking for their Lordships of the Privy Council, he said at pp. 449-450:\nTheir Lordships must not, of course, be understood to suggest that in a case where evidence has been given (and it is difficult to imagine a case where such evidence would be other than medical evidence) that irresistible impulse is a symptom of the particular disease of the mind from which a prisoner is said to be suffering and as to its effect on his ability to know the nature and quality of his act or that his act is wrong it would not be the duty of the judge to deal with the matter in the same way as any other relevant evidence given at the trial.\nIn that sense irresistible impulse is of itself evidence of a disease of the mind.\nThe evidence of irresistible impulse is also relevant to the issue of whether the accused is capable of appreciating the nature and quality of the act. It is not so relevant in England. The reason for the difference is that there is a difference between the definition of the defence of insanity in s. 16 of the Canadian Criminal Code and the State- ment of the defence according to M\u2019Naghten\u2019s case[6]. In M\u2019Naghten\u2019s case the judges said that a man could not be held to be insane unless he did not know the nature and quality of the act he was doing. Section 16 of the Canadian Criminal Code states that a man cannot be held to be insane unless he did not appreciate the nature and quality of the act he was doing. A man operating under an irresistible impulse may have knowledge of the nature and quality of his act without appreciating its nature and quality. A man may be aware of an act without foreseeing and measuring its consequences. That is what Dr. Spaner testified to here when he said: \u201cI think I said before, the moral issues of right and wrong are not operating at\u2014when the impulse is at a certain intensity. That part of the mind is not operating.\u201d\nAlthough what the learned trial judge said as previously quoted was good law, it was irrelevant law in context. There was no question of the jury concluding that Borg was insane simply because there was evidence that he acted under an irresistible impulse because there was medical evidence that Borg was suffering from a disease of the mind, and in failing to point out to the jury that the theory of the defence was that Borg had a disease of the mind and that the irresistible impulse was the manifestation of that disease, he failed to put the theory of the defence adequately to the jury.\nThe Chief Justice, being of the view that there was no error in law and that no valid exception could be taken to the charge of the learned trial judge to the jury, saw no need to invoke s. 592(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code which authorizes that even when there has been an error in law at the trial, the Court of Appeal (and this Court has the same power) to dismiss the appeal if, notwithstanding that a ground of appeal may be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred. Having come to the conclusion that there was in this case an error in law, I should consider the provision of that section. I am of opinion that the section should not be invoked here. I agree with Spence J. in Colpitis v. The Queen[7], where he said at 756:\nI am of the opinion that this Court cannot place itself in the position of a jury and weigh these various pieces of evidence. If there is any possibility that twelve reasonable men, properly charged, would have a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, then this Court should not apply the provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) to affirm a conviction.\nThere is a further and separate issue which arises in this appeal and it is as to the power of this Court to make a final disposition of the appeal notwithstanding that the Appellate Division did not consider any grounds other than those set out in the reasons of the learned Chief Justice of Alberta. On this aspect of the appeal, I am fully in agreement with the Chief Justice that this Court has the jurisdiction to do what the Appellate Division was required to do by subs. (3) of s. 583A of the Criminal Code. My consideration of the record brought me to the conclusion that there was error in the learned trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury, but I have no doubt as to this Court\u2019s power under s. 46 of the Supreme Court Act to render the judgment which the Appellate Division could or should have given.\nI would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta granting the appellant a new trial.\nAppeal allowed and conviction restored, Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: The Attorney General for Alberta, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Milner & Steer, Edmonton.\n[1] (1969), 66 W.W.R. 385, 5 C.R.N.S. 222.\n[2] [1949] A.C. 182 at 192.\n[3] [1954] S.C.R. 3, 17 C.R. 412, 107 C.C.C. 304.\n[4] [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495, 15 C.R. 181, 104 C.C.C. 97.\n[5] [1960] A.C. 432, [1960] 1 All E.R. 734.\n[6] (1843), 10 Cl. & F. 200, 8 E.R. 718.\n[7] [1965] S.C.R. 739, 47 C.R. 175, [1966] 1 C.C.C. 146, 52 D.L.R.

Crighton, [1969] S.C.R. 573\nDate: 1969-02-21\nStephen Boleslav Roman (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nJohn David Crighton (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1969: February 6, 7, 21.\nPresent: Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nDamages\u2014Joint action brought by plaintiff and executors of estate for return of shares\u2014Executors successful at trial\u2014Plaintiff failing in two Courts before succeeding in Supreme Court\u2014Separate actions for damages for wrongful detention between date of original judgment and date when shares received\u2014Claim for difference between price received and highest price at which shares traded during period\u2014Executors\u2019 action successful on appeal\u2014Whether Plaintiff\u2019s position differentiated from that of executors\u2014Whether defendant entitled to relief under s. 35 of The Trustee Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 408.\nThe plaintiff C instituted an action, in which he had as his co-plaintiff a trust company in its capacity as executor of the estate of F, against the defendant R. In this joint action the plaintiffs claimed, inter alia, the return to each of them of certain shares of stock. At trial the executors\u2019 claim for delivery of the shares was allowed but the corresponding claim of C was dismissed. From the trial judgment R and C appealed to the Court of Appeal which dismissed both appeals. On appeal to this Court, R\u2019s appeal was dismissed and C\u2019s appeal was allowed.\nFollowing the decision of this Court in the joint action, both plaintiffs in that action commenced separate actions claiming damages for the wrongful detention of their shares between the date of the original judgment at the trial and the date when the shares were actually delivered. As R had been held to be a trustee of the shares for the plaintiffs, the damages claimed were the difference between the price actually realized by them for their shares and the highest price at which the shares were traded during the period. The executors of F proceeded with their action but, by consent, C\u2019s action was stayed pending the outcome of the F action. The latter action was dismissed at trial but an appeal was allowed by the Court of Appeal and the damages as claimed were awarded to the executors. An appeal from the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was dismissed by this Court.\nC then proceeded with his action which was dismissed after a trial without a jury. The trial decision was reversed on appeal and R then appealed from the judgment of the Court of Appeal to this Court.\nThe points in issue were: (i) whether the fact that C did not obtain a judgment in his favour with respect to the shares he claimed until his case had reached this Court differentiated his position in this case from that of the executors of F\u2019s estate in their case, and (ii) whether, assuming C to be entitled to damages on the same basis as were the executors of F, the appellant should be relieved from paying them under the provisions of s. 35 of The Trustee Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 408. Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\nOn both of the points in issue the Court agreed with and adopted the reasons of the Court below. C was entitled to damages on the same basis as were the executors of F, and R was not entitled to relief under s. 35 of The Trustee Act.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Stewart J. Appeal dismissed.\nJoseph Sedgwick, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nTerence Sheard, Q.C., and Rodney Hull, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal by the defendant, Roman, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 dated February 23, 1968. The judgment appealed from reversed the judgment of Stewart J. who had dismissed the action with costs after a trial without jury. The judgment appealed from awarded the respondent $31,105.90 damages, suffered as a result of the wrongful detention of 7,143 shares of Consolidated Denison Mines Limited.\nThe action was tried on an agreed statement of fact and for the purposes of this appeal a brief summary thereof will be sufficient.\nOn August 4, 1955, the plaintiff Crighton instituted an action, in which he had as his co\u2011plaintiff The Toronto General Trusts Corporation in its capacity of executor of the Estate of the late William Ray Featherstone, deceased, against the defendant Roman. This action may for convenience be termed the joint action and in it the plaintiffs claimed, inter alia, the return to each of them of 25,000 shares of the capital stock of North Denison Mines Limited held by the defendant Roman and later represented by 7,143 shares of Consolidated Denison Mines Limited.\nThe joint action came on for trial before Judson J., then a member of the Supreme Court of Ontario. By his judgment, (delivered on February 5, 1958), the claim of the executors of Featherstone for delivery of the shares was allowed but the corresponding claim of the plaintiff Crighton was dismissed. From this judgment Roman and Crighton appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario which dismissed both appeals. They then appealed to this Court which by a judgment dated October 4, 1960, dismissed Roman\u2019s appeal from the judgment in favour of the executors of Feather-stone and allowed Crighton\u2019s appeal. The judgment was entered on November 23, 1960, after a motion before the Court to settle its terms. (This judgment is reported sub. nom. Crighton v. Roman, Roman v. Toronto General Trusts Corp.[2]). Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the formal judgment read as follows:\n2. AND THIS COURT DID FURTHER ORDER AND DECLARE that the respondent (defendant) Stephen Boleslav Roman is a trustee accountable to the appellant (plaintiff) John D. Crighton for twenty-five thousand (25,000) fully paid shares in North Denison Mines Limited or the equivalent thereof, being seven thousand, one hundred and forty\u2011three (7,143) fully paid shares of Consolidated Denison Mines Limited found to be in the hands of the respondent (defendant) Stephen Boleslav Roman at the time of trial of this action, AND DID FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the respondent (defendant) Stephen Boleslav Roman do forthwith deliver to the appellant (plaintiff) John D. Crighton the said shares or the equivalent thereof, being seven thousand, one hundred and forty-three (7,143) fully paid shares of Denison Mines Limited;\n3. AND THIS COURT DID FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the respondent (defendant) Roman do account for and pay to the appellant (plaintiff) Crighton all dividends upon the shares so ordered to be delivered, including the amount of Ten thousand, seven hundred and fourteen Dollars and fifty cents ($10,714.50) declared and paid prior to the date of this judgment;\nDuring the period between the decision of the Court of Appeal in the joint action and the final judgment of this Court two dividends aggregating $1.50 per share were paid on the shares of Consolidated Denison Mines Limited and the judgment of this Court directed that Roman, who was found to have been a trustee and who had received these dividends, should account to Crighton for them. This he did on January 30, 1961. In compliance with the judgment of this Court, Roman delivered to Crighton, certificates for 7,100 shares on December 8, 1960, and for the balance of 43 shares on December 20, 1960.\nFollowing the decision of this Court in the joint action, both plaintiffs in that action namely, The Toronto General Trusts Corporation as executors of Featherstone, and Crighton, commenced separate actions claiming damages for the wrongful detention of their shares between the date of the original judgment at the trial namely, February 5, 1958, and the date when the shares were actually delivered. As Roman had been held to be a trustee of the shares for the plaintiffs, the damages claimed were the difference between the price actually realized by them for their shares and the highest price at which the shares were traded during the period namely, 16\u215d on June 16, 1958. The executors of Featherstone proceeded with their action but, by consent, Crighton\u2019s action was stayed pending the outcome of the Featherstone action.\nBy a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario delivered by Schroeder J.A. damages as claimed were awarded to the executors of Featherstone (the judgment is reported in [1963] 1 O.R. 312). This decision was appealed to this Court which, in a judgment delivered by my brother Martland, agreed with and adopted the reasons of Schroeder J.A. See [1963] S.C.R. vi, 41 D.L.R. (2d) 290. Following this decision, Crighton proceeded with his action which is now the subject of this appeal.\nThere are two points only in issue in this appeal. The first point is whether the fact that Crighton did not obtain a judgment in his favour with respect to the shares he claimed until his case had reached this Court differentiates his position in this case from that of the executors of the Featherstone Estate in their case. The appellant claims that it does and that Crighton is entitled to no damages. The respondent claims that it does not and that he is entitled to damages on the same basis as the executors of the Featherstone Estate were found to be. If the respondent\u2019s contention on this point is upheld, there is no dispute as to the amount of damages awarded by the Court of Appeal.\nThe second point is whether, assuming Crighton to be entitled to damages on the same basis as were the executors of Featherstone, the appellant should be relieved from paying them under the provisions of s. 35 of The Trustee Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 408. The appellant claims he should be so relieved whereas the respondent says there is no ground for relieving him. This contention was not raised by the defendant in the action brought by the executors of Featherstone; it was not dealt with by Stewart J. as that learned Judge had held that the action failed; it was rejected by the Court of Appeal. It should be noted that there was no conflict of view between any of the judges who dealt with Crighton\u2019s claim against Roman in the joint action as to whether Roman originally held the shares as trustee for Crighton as well as for Featherstone. The difference of opinion between the majority in this Court on the one hand and Kerwin C.J. and the judges in the Courts below on the other hand was as to whether Roman had received a valid release or assignment of Crighton\u2019s beneficial interest in the shares.\nOn both of the points in issue in this appeal which are set out above I find myself so fully in agreement with the reasons of Laskin J.A. that I am content to adopt them and do not find it necessary to add anything to what he has said.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Smith, Rae, Greer, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Strathy, Archibald, Seagram & Cole, Toronto.\n[1] [1968] 1 O.R. 769, 67 D.L.R.

The order withdrawing the license had been made following an inquiry held under art. 21 of the General By-Law. In an action commenced by the respondent in the Exchequer Court, the trial judge held that art. 19(1) of the General By-Law was null and void on the ground that the pilotage authority had exceeded its power to make by-laws under s. 329 of the Canada Shipping Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 29. The pilotage authority was granted leave to appeal to this Court. Held: The appeal should be allowed.\nIn enacting s. 329(f) of the Canada Shipping Act, Parliament intended to confer upon a pilotage authority wide powers to regulate by by-law the conduct of pilots under its jurisdiction. Article 19(1) of the General By-Law, which prohibits the consumption of alcoholic beverages by a pilot while on duty or about to go on duty, was validly enacted under the authority of the said section 329.\nArticle 21 of the General By-Law, which authorizes the holding of such an inquiry as was held in this case, was valid.\nCouronne\u2014Pilote\u2014Annulation d\u2019un brevet de pilote pour violation de r\u00e8glement\u2014L\u2019autorit\u00e9 de pilotage avait-elle juridiction pour ordonner l\u2019annulation\u2014Loi sur la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier, S.R.C. 1952, c. 98\u2014Loi sur la marine marchande du Canada, S.R.C. 1952, c. 29.\nL\u2019appelant, en sa qualit\u00e9 d\u2019autorit\u00e9 de pilotage du district de Qu\u00e9bec, a \u00e9mis une ordonnance en vertu de laquelle le brevet de pilote de l\u2019intim\u00e9 lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 pour le motif qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait rendu coupable d\u2019avoir consomm\u00e9 de la boisson enivrante pendant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait de service, contrairement aux dispositions de l\u2019art. 19(1) du r\u00e8glement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la circonscription de pilotage de Qu\u00e9bec.

Appel accueilli.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Dumoulin J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada. Appeal allowed.\nPaul Coderre, Q.C., for the appellant.\nRaymond Caron, for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nABBOTT J.:\u2014Appellant, in his capacity as the pilotage authority for the pilotage district of Quebec (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cAuthority\u201d), has appealed from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, dated November 12, 1968, annulling an Order of the Authority dated May 19, 1967, under which the licence of respondent as a pilot for the said pilotage district was withdrawn on the ground that he had been guilty of having consumed intoxicating liquor while on duty, contrary to the provisions of art. 19(1) of the General By-Law of the Authority (SOR 57-51 as amended). The said Order was made by the Authority, following an inquiry held under art. 21 of the said General By-Law.\nOn December 10, 1968, I granted leave to appeal from the said judgment, under s. 83 of the Exchequer Court Act, subject to respondent\u2019s right to argue before the Court as to whether such leave to appeal could be granted. At the hearing before us, counsel for both parties agreed that leave could be granted and I share that view. It seems clear that future rights of appellant as pilotage authority are affected by the judgment a quo.\nIn his action before the Exchequer Court, respondent asked (1) that the Order withdrawing his licence as a pilot be cancelled and annulled by reason of numerous irregularities and illegalities alleged in the Statement of Claim, and (2) that art. 19(1) of the General By-Law of the Authority be declared irregular, illegal and beyond the powers of the Authority to enact under the provisions of s. 329 of the Canada Shipping Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 29, as amended.\nUnder Rule 149 of the Rules of the Exchequer Court, on the application of respondent, the President of the Exchequer Court ordered that the following questions of law be determined prior to a hearing on the merits.\n1. Has the Exchequer Court jurisdiction to hear and determine the present action?\n2. Was the Order of the Authority withdrawing the licence of respondent illegal and without effect, because arts. 19(1) and 21 of the General By-Law above referred to are ultra vires, the powers of the Authority?\nAt the hearing in the Court below, it was conceded that the Exchequer Court had jurisdiction in view of the decision of this Court in Jones & Maheux v. Gamache,[1] judgment in which was rendered on October, 1, 1968. As to the second question, the learned trial judge held that art. 19(1) of the General By-Law of the Authority was null and void, on the ground that the Authority had exceeded its power to make by-laws under s. 329 of the Canada Shipping Act, when it adopted the said article. This being sufficient to dispose of the question before him, he did not find it necessary to consider the validity of art. 21 of the said by-law.\nThe relevant portions of s. 329 and the said art. 19(1) read as follows:\nSection 329:\nSubject to the provisions of this Part, or of any Act for the time being in force in its pilotage district, every pilotage authority shall, within its district, have power, from time to time, by by-law confirmed by the Governor in Council, to\n* * *\n(f) make regulations for the government of pilots, and of masters and mates holding certificates enabling them to act as pilots on their own ships, and for ensuring their good conduct on board ship and ashore and constant attendance to and effectual performance of their duty on board and on shore, and for the government of apprentices, and for regulating the number thereof and for the holding of enquiries either before the pilotage authority or any other person into any matters dealt with in this Part; and without restricting the generality of the foregoing make regulations with respect to every licensed pilot or apprentice pilot who, either within or without the district for which he is licensed,\n* * *\n(iii) acts as pilot or apprentice pilot while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or narcotic drugs, while on duty or about to go on duty,\n* * *\nArticle 19(1):\nNo pilot shall, while on duty or about to go on duty, consume intoxicating liquor or consume or use a narcotic drug; and the licence of any pilot contravening these provisions shall be withdrawn by the Authority.\nThis Court held in Jones & Maheux v. Gamache that the word \u201cgovernment\u201d (in the French version \u201cgouverne\u201d) contemplates the conduct of pilots. It seems evident to me that the consumption of alcoholic beverages while on duty comes under that heading.\nThe learned trial judge was of opinion that sub-para. (iii) of para. (f) of s. 329 had the effect of limiting the general provisions of the text of the section to cases where a pilot was \u201cunder the influence\u201d of alcoholic beverages. In other words, it would have to be shown that his behaviour was in fact affected by the alcohol he had consumed. He, therefore, held that the Authority, in enacting art. 19(1) which prohibits the consumption of alcoholic beverages by a pilot while on duty or about to go on duty, had exceeded the power conferred by the statute. With the greatest respect for the opinion of the learned trial judge, I am unable to agree with that interpretation.\nIt seems clear that, in enacting s. 329(f), Parliament intended to confer upon a pilotage authority wide powers to regulate by by-law the conduct of pilots under its jurisdiction. That intention is evidenced by the fact that the operative text of para. (f), just prior to an enumeration of certain specified matters, contains the words \u201cand without restricting the generality of the foregoing make regulations with respect to every licensed pilot or apprentice pilot, who, either within or without the district for which he is licensed,\u2026\u201d. There then follows an enumeration of seven specified subjects.\nA similar question was considered by this Court in Re George Edwin Gray.[2] The issue there related to the power of the Governor-in-Council to make regulations under a provision of the War Measures Act, which read as follows:\nThe Governor in Council shall have power to do and authorize such acts and things, and to make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he may by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada; and for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms, it is hereby declared that the powers of the Governor in Council shall extend to all matters coming within the classes of subjects hereinafter enumerated, that is to say:\u2014\u2026\nThere followed an enumeration of six specified subjects.\nAt p. 158, Fitzpatrick C.J. said this:\nBut it is said that the enumeration of several matters in section 6 of the \u201cWar Measures Act\u201d limits the effect of the general power conferred. The answer to this objection, as urged by Mr. Newcombe, would appear to be 1st, that the statute itself expressly provides otherwise; and 2nd, that the reason for introducing specifications was that those specified subjects were more or less remote from those which were connected with the war, and it was therefore thought expedient to declare explicitly that the legislative power of the government could go even thus far. The decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, under section 91 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d upon similar language exclude such limited interpretation.\nAnd at p. 167, Duff J., as he then was, said:\nThe authority conferred by the words quoted is a law-making authority, that is to say an authority (within the scope and subject to the conditions prescribed) to supersede the existing law whether resting on statute or otherwise; and since the enactment is always speaking, \u201cInterpretation Act,\u201d section 9, it is an authority to do so from time to time. It follows that unless the language of the first branch of section 6 is affected by a qualifying context or by subsequent statutory modification the order-in-council of the 20th April (the subject matter of which in the above expressed view is indisputably within the scope of the \u201cWar Measures Act\u201d) is authorized by it.\nThere is no qualifying context. There is in the second branch of the section an enumeration (an enumeration let it be said rather of groups of subjects which it appears to have been thought might possibly be regarded as \u201cmarginal instances\u201d as to which there might conceivably arise some controversy whether or not they fell within the first branch of the section) of particular subjects and a declaration that the powers thereby given to the Governor-in-council extended to these subjects, so enumerated; but there is also a declaration that this enumeration shall not have the effect of limiting the \u201cgenerality\u201d of the language of the first branch of the section\u2014the language quoted above. Thus the context, instead of qualifying the preceding language (the language quoted), emphasizes the comprehensive character of it and pointedly suggests the intention that the words are to be comprehensively interpreted and applied.\nAs was the case in Gray, the enumeration of specified subjects in s. 329(f) does not have the effect, in my opinion, of limiting the general power to make by-laws regulating the conduct of pilots which is conferred under the section. It follows that art. 19(1) of the General By-Law was validly enacted under the authority of the said s. 329.\nRespondent also challenged the validity of art. 21 of the General By-Law of the Authority which reads\nArticle 21\n(1) Where a pilot is ch0061rged with having violated a provision of this By-law,\n(a) the Authority may appoint a person to hold an inquiry to determine the validity of the charge; or\n(b) with the consent of the pilot charged, the Superintendent may determine the validity of the charge.\n(2) Where a person appointed pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection (1) determines that the pilot charged has violated any of the provisions of this By-law, the Authority may impose on that pilot a penalty not exceeding two hundred dollars or withdraw or suspend his licence or both impose a penalty and withdraw or suspend his licence. (3) Where the Superintendent, pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection (1), determines that the pilot charged has violated any of the provisions of this By-law, the Superintendent may impose on that pilot a penalty not exceeding one hundred dollars.\n(4) Any penalty imposed on a pilot pursuant to subsection (2) or (3) may be recovered by deduction from moneys owing to that pilot by the Authority and the Authority may suspend the licence of a pilot until the penalty imposed on him has been paid.\nThe relevant portion of s. 329 of the Canada Shipping Act under which this by-law was enacted reads:\nSubject to the provisions of this Part, or of any Act for the time being in force in its pilotage district, every pilotage authority shall\u2026 have power\u2026 by by-law confirmed by the Governor in Council to\u2026 make regulations\u2026 for the holding of enquiries either before the pilotage authority or any other person into any matters dealt with in this Part;\nRespondent submitted that art. 21 of the General By-Law is beyond the power of the Authority to enact on the ground that s. 329 does not authorize the Authority to enact a by-law in such general terms, without specifying the procedure to be followed on an inquiry and designating some person or persons other than the Authority to make such enquiry.\nI am unable to agree with that submission. In my opinion the enquiry contemplated, under s. 329 of the Act and art. 21 of the General By-Law, is a purely administrative matter to ascertain facts. The power of the person appointed to conduct such enquiry is to make an enquiry as to fact and to report to the Authority. Any decision must be made by the Authority itself which is not bound to accept the finding of the person named to conduct the enquiry. In my view, art. 21 of the General By-Law of the Authority, which authorizes the holding of such an enquiry, is valid.\nThe present appeal is limited to the question of the validity of arts. 19(1) and 21 of the General By-Law of the Authority. We do not have to consider whether, on the merits, the Authority was justified in adopting the Order which it did withdrawing the respondent\u2019s licence.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs, the judgment of the Exchequer Court set aside, and the record returned to that Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D.S.

Powers & Son Limited (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1969: February 26, 27; 1969: March 31.\nPresent: Cartwright C.J. and Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nReal property\u2014Subdivision plan showing certain lands as public highways\u2014Whether properties dedicated to public use and titles vested in municipality\u2014Whether maker of plan owned properties in question at time plan prepared\u2014Whether ad medium filum rule applied\u2014The Beds of Navigable Waters Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 32, s. 1.\nA judgment at trial granted a declaration that the respondent company was the owner of certain lands and ordered the appellant municipality to pay damages for trespass. An appeal from the said judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal and the municipality then appealed further to this Court. The appellant contended that the two pieces of property in question had been dedicated to the public use and were public highways, the titles of which were vested in it. The respondent\u2019s defence was that there was never any dedication of either piece of property by an individual or corporation who had title to do so.\nA subdivision plan of the Village of Trenton (as the municipality was then) prepared for one H on March 15, 1864, and registered on August 9, 1865, showed an unnamed street as a public highway as well as all of Ontario Street even though at that time the disputed area of Ontario Street was completely under water. By virtue of the force of certain statutory enactments the unnamed street and the disputed area of Ontario Street would have become public streets unless H did not own either piece of property at the time the plan was prepared.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe unnamed street had been conveyed to an individual by H in 1850, long before his plan was registered. In the case of Ontario Street, H\u2019s title depended upon whether the ad medium filum rule applied. The appellant\u2019s argument that the rule did apply was foreclosed by s. 1 of The Beds of Navigable Waters Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 32, which provides that where land bordering on a navigable body of water \u201chas been heretofore or is hereafter granted by the Crown\u201d, the bed does not pass in the absence of an express grant of it. The root of title to that portion of Ontario Street shown to be under water on H\u2019s plan was a Crown grant of a 70-acre water lot made in 1876. In 1901 both properties had come into the ownership of the respondent\u2019s predecessor in title. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming a judgment of Landreville J. Appeal dismissed.\nJohn Sopinka, for the defendant, appellant.\nS.G.M. Grange, Q.C., and J.W.V. Stephens, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal1 affirming a judgment at trial which granted a declaration that the respondent was the owner of certain lands and ordered the appellants to pay damages for trespass.\nTwo pieces of property in the Town of Trenton are the subject of this appeal. One consists of a portion of Ontario Street, which runs in an easterly direction from Foundry Street (which is a north-south street) to a point where it meets the other piece known as the unnamed street (hereafter referred to as Street X), which runs north, at an angle to the west, until it meets Sidney Street. Both pieces are located on the respondent\u2019s premises, and coal sheds and oil storage tanks occupy a considerable part of the Ontario Street extension, while part of Street X is covered by a community centre, the land for the centre being conveyed to the appellant by the respondent in 1956.\nThe appellant contends that these two pieces of property have been dedicated to the public use and are public highways, the titles of which are vested in it. The respondent\u2019s defence is that there was never any dedication of either piece of property by an individual or corporation who had title so to do. The Court of Appeal, after a detailed consideration of the instruments, plans and related documents submitted in argument, came to the conclusion that this was so and I agree.\nLaskin J.A. thought the appellant\u2019s claim initially depended upon the first subdivision plan of the Village of Trenton (as it was then) prepared for one Sheldon Hawley on March 15, 1864, and registered on August 9, 1865. This showed Street X as a public highway as well as all of Ontario Street even though at that time the disputed area of Ontario Street was completely under water. And by virtue of the force of certain statutory enactments, Street X and the disputed area of Ontario Street would have become public streets unless Hawley did not own either piece of property at the time the plan was prepared. In his view it was clear that Hawley did not own either at the crucial time. Some fourteen years earlier, in 1850, he had made a grant of land, which included Street X, to one Allan Gilmour. This property, as a result of a consolidation of various properties in 1901, ended up in the hands of Gilmour & Co. Ltd., which is the predecessor in title of the respondent. This was a complete answer to the appellant\u2019s arguments based upon estoppel and s. 86(5) of The Registry Act as enacted by 1964 (Ont.), c. 102, s. 22, and its forerunners. In respect of the third argument in connection with Street X, that as there was some indication in some of the instruments or documents that Lot 37A included Street X, then it passed to the appellants under the tax arrears certificate respecting Lot 37A, dated September 20, 1937, it failed as the earliest instruments as well as the more recent indicated that these were considered to be two separate pieces of property. A misdescription was not enough to found a claim of title and that is all that had occurred here.\nIn the case of Ontario Street, Hawley\u2019s title depended upon whether the ad medium filum rule applied. In the opinion of Laskin J.A., it did not. He was disposed to hold that the ad medium filum rule did not apply to navigable rivers (of which the Trent is one) in Ontario. I agree with him. However, he did not rely upon this ground as he held that the appellant\u2019s argument was foreclosed by s. 1 of The Beds of Navigable Waters Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 32, which was clearly retroactive and applicable. Thus the respondent\u2019s title to the disputed area of Ontario Street which can be directly traced from a grant made by the Crown to one John Gilmour on April 1, 1876, and recorded April 18, 1876, of a 70-acre water lot which included the disputed area and which ended up in the hands of Gilmour & Co. Ltd., in the consolidation of 1901, stood unaffected by the claim of the appellant.\nThis was really sufficient to dispose of the appeal. To summarize: Hawley had conveyed Street X long before his plan was registered; the root of title to that portion of Ontario Street shown to be under water on Hawley\u2019s plan is the Grown grant of the 70-acre water lot made in 1876. In 1901 both properties came into the ownership of Gilmour & Co. Ltd., the predecessor in title of B.W. Powers & Son Limited, the respondent.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Fasken & Calvin, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: McMillan, Binch, Berry, Dunn, Corrigan & Rowland, Toronto.\n[1] [1967] 2 O.R. 432, 64 D.L.R.

As a result of his extensive trading in the shares of a mining company, he held, at the end of his fiscal year 1955, an inventory of 568,900 shares. He was assessed for income tax on the basis that the proper valuation for his inventory was his average cost of all the shares bought by him. This was computed by dividing his total purchase of 1,609,860 shares into the total cost of $608,229.62. The Exchequer Court upheld the Minister\u2019s assessment with a variation based on a shorter averaging period. The taxpayer appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe appellant\u2019s closing inventory could not be valued on any basis lower than the average cost of the shares as determined by the trial judge. The latter was fully justified in holding that there was no evidence that a reasonable programme of disposition of the inventory would have brought the market price below cost. No basis could therefore be found in the evidence for establishing a market value lower than cost. None of the different bases of computation submitted by the appellant to establish a cost lower than the cost determined by the trial judge could be accepted.\nThe method of \u201cspecific identification\u201d by which one identifies the shares remaining in the inventory by an examination of the serial numbers on the certificates is inapplicable to company shares. As long as a shareholder continues to hold a certain quantity of shares none of his shares is distinguishable from any other.\nNo convincing evidence was given that the method known as \u201cfirst in, first out\u201d (FIFO) was a proper method for valuing such an inventory and it was not shown to be in use to any extent by persons in a situation similar to the appellant\u2019s.\nThe \u201cproject\u201d method which consists in applying total receipts from the sales of some of the shares against the cost of all the shares sold or unsold\u2014no sale being considered as yielding any profit until the entire cost of the venture is recovered\u2014must be rejected for income tax purposes on the authority of M.N.R. v. Anaconda American Brass Ltd., [1956] A.C. 85. What the appellant was really trying to accomplish by this method of accounting was to set up against the contingency that his inventory might drop in value, a reserve equal to his profit so far on the operation. Such a reserve is prohibited by s. 12(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014\u00c9valuation d\u2019un inventaire de fin d\u2019ann\u00e9e\u2014Promoteur d\u2019\u00e9missions de valeurs mobili\u00e8res\u2014\u00c9valuation d\u2019actions d\u2019une compagnie\u2014Identification sp\u00e9cifique\u2014Num\u00e9ros des certificats\u2014Cote de la Bourse\u2014Prix co\u00fbtant pour le contribuable ou juste valeur marchande\u2014Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, art. 12(1)(e), 14(2).\nL\u2019appelant est un promoteur d\u2019\u00e9missions d\u2019actions mini\u00e8res.

Appeal rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Cattanach J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in an income tax matter. Appeal dismissed.\nR.E. Shibley, Q.C., and M.L. O\u2019Brien, for the appellant.\nM.A. Mogan and G.V. Anderson, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nPIGEON J.:\u2014Appellant is a mining stock promoter. In 1954 he \u201ctook over\u201d, as he says, Maneast Uranium Corporation Limited (\u201cManeast\u201d). The shares were then quoted around 3 cents. He became president having effective control, distributed promotional material and started selling shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange between 20 and 34 cents. In October, he took down 100,000 treasury shares. In December, he entered into an underwriting agreement for 200,000 shares at 20 cents with an option on an additional 800,000 shares at 20 cents for the first 200,000 shares, 25 cents for the next 200,000 shares, 30 cents for the following 200,000 shares and 35 cents for the balance. All these were taken down, the last two lots on May 10, 1955.\nWhile selling as many shares as he could, appellant was also buying substantial quantities on the stock exchange in order, as he says, \u201cto maintain the market\u201d. As a result of his operations he held, at the end of his fiscal year, May 31, 1955, an inventory of 568,900 shares. He was assessed for income tax on the basis that the proper valuation for this inventory was his average cost of all Maneast shares bought by him. This was computed at 37\u00bd cents by dividing his total purchases of 1,609,860 shares (being 1,100,000 treasury shares plus 509,860 market shares) into the total cost of $608,229.62 (being $310,000.00 plus $298,229.62). However, on the appeal before the Exchequer Court, it being shown that on April 18 appellant had been in a \u201cshort position\u201d, respondent determined that the correct average cost was 34.1 cents per share on the basis of a shorter averaging period, from April 19 to May 31, 1955, and Cattanach J. ordered the assessment to be varied accordingly. Otherwise he dismissed the appeal without costs to either party.\nThe only question on the appeal to this Court is whether appellant\u2019s 1955 closing inventory should be valued on any basis lower than the average cost as above determined. Section 14(2) of the Income Tax Act reads:\n14(2). For the purpose of computing income, the property described in an inventory shall be valued at its cost to the taxpayer or its fair market value, whichever is lower, or in such other manlier as may be permitted by regulation.\nAs there is no other manner permitted by regulation in such a case, the only bases to be considered are cost and fair market value.\nOn the Toronto Stock Exchange the closing bid on May 31, 1955 was 67 cents per share. There were in that month 535,440 shares traded at prices ranging between a low of 49 cents and a high of 73 cents. In the following month, there were 1,184,560 shares traded between a low of 63 cents and a high of $1.03. Cattanach J. said:\n\u2026there was a very substantial volume of sales at prices greatly in excess of what the shares cost the appellant and the Toronto Stock Exchange continued to list Maneast shares at prices in excess of cost to the appellant for almost a year after the end of the taxation year. On the other hand, there was no evidence that a reasonable programme of disposition in respect of the appellant\u2019s inventory as of the end of May would have brought the market price below cost. It may well be inferred that, if the appellant\u2019s whole inventory had been thrown on the market at one time, the price would have dropped to nothing. There was no evidence, however, that by a carefully planned programme, he could not have disposed of all the shares at a price equal to or in excess of his cost. The onus was on the appellant to show that the actual fair market value of the inventory at the end of May 1955 was less than cost and in my opinion the appellant has failed to discharge that onus.\nAs against this finding appellant says that he was under obligation by virtue of the Stock Exchange rules \u201cto run an orderly market\u201d and that this prevented him from selling any more shares than he did. However, the fact is that by the end of December 1955, his inventory was down to 123,980 shares, the high and low within that month being 41 cents and 30 cents.\nIn my view, the trial judge was fully justified in holding that there was no evidence that a reasonable programme of disposition of the inventory would have brought the market price below cost. Therefore, even on the assumption that in appellant\u2019s special circumstances the Stock Exchange quotation at the material date was not to be taken as the market value, no basis can be found in the evidence for establishing a market value lower than cost. No attempt was made to show what another promoter would have been willing to pay for acquiring appellant\u2019s inventory.\nThere remain to be considered the different bases of computation submitted by appellant to establish a cost lower than 34.1 cents per share.\nOne of the methods suggested is described as \u201cspecific identification\u201d. It is sought to be applied by identifying the shares remaining in the inventory by an examination of the serial numbers on the certificates that were held for appellant by his broker. This method was properly rejected because it is inapplicable to company shares. As was pointed out by Kerwin J. (as he then was) in Canada China Clay Ltd. v. Hepburn[2], \u201cthe distinction between a share of capital stock of a company and the certificate of such share is (to be) borne in mind\u2026\u201d. As long as a shareholder continues to hold a certain quantity none of his shares is distinguishable from any other. Appellant\u2019s witness Lachance, an expert accountant, said: \u201cAll shares are interchangeable one with the other\u201d. To endeavour to ascertain the cost by reference to the serial numbers of the certificates held would mean that the cost would be determined according to a criterion that has no relevance to the actual situation. The shares were clearly fungible things and the specific identification method was impossible of application.\nFurthermore, as Cattanach J. noted, there were at least some 40,000 shares for which the origin of the certificates could not be traced. Appellant contended that the difficulty could be solved by valuing these at average cost. This contention is to be rejected because if in some way a portion of the inventory is valued on another basis, that portion cannot be used in striking an average, specially when the average largely reflects the excluded portion, the treasury shares. If all but some 40,000 shares are valued on the assumption that they are treasury shares the others must be valued as market shares. If this is done the result is a cost higher than the average calculated by the Minister.\nThe result is much the same if one attempts to apply the method known as \u201cFirst in, first out\u201d (Fifo). In order to arrive at a cost lower than the average it is necessary to apply this method on the assumption that treasury shares only were in the inventory. To make such a distinction is really not to apply Fifo because the very principle of every method of valuation is uniform application. In any case no convincing evidence was given that Fifo was a proper method for valuing such an inventory and it was not shown to be in use to any extent by persons in a situation similar to appellant\u2019s.\nAppellant contends that the trial judge was in error in rejecting Fifo for the following reason:\nthe evidence as to which stock certificates were used for particular sales did not lead to the conclusion that there was a tendency to use the oldest certificates first.\nAppellant points out that in Minister of National Revenue v. Anaconda American Brass Ltd.[3], the Privy council held in favour of Fifo as a convenient assumption not as corresponding with an actual user test. This does not invalidate Cattanach\u2019s main basis for the rejection of Fifo which is as follows:\nNo evidence was given, however, that would lead to the conclusion that this assumption was closer to reality than the averaging basis adopted by the Minister.\nThis leaves for consideration the only costing method that would in fact yield a figure very substantially inferior to the average, namely, the \u201cproject\u201d method of accounting. Shortly stated, this system consists in applying total receipts from the sales of some Maneast shares against the cost of all Maneast shares sold or unsold. In other words, no sale is considered as yielding any profit until the entire cost of the venture is recovered. It appears from some reported cases that the method is in fact applied by the Minister in the assessment of isolated transactions that do not fall within the description of a business in the ordinary sense but are assessable as such by virtue of the statutory definition (section 139(1)(e)): Sissons v. Minister of National Revenue[4]; Weinstein v. Minister of National Revenue[5]. However, the method is contended to be inapplicable to a regular business.\nIn my view, the decision in the Anaconda case is conclusive on that point. In that case, Lifo was rejected on the basis that it involved setting up as an element in valuing the inventory an \u201cunabsorbed residue of cost\u201d (at p. 101):\nIt is in fact, so far as tax law is concerned, a novel and even revolutionary proposal that the physical facts should even where they can wholly or partly be ascertained be disregarded for the purpose of the opening and closing inventory and a theoretical assumption made which is based on a supposed \u201cflow of cost\u201d and an \u201cunabsorbed residue of cost\u201d.\nSeeing that the project method really consists in valuing the inventory by equating it with the unrecovered cost of the venture in Maneast shares, it must be rejected for income tax purposes on the authority of the Anaconda case.\nAppellant laid great stress on the speculative character of the venture and endeavoured to liken it to a Christmas tree selling operation. He contended that as there was no proven value behind the Maneast shares they could, at any time, become worthless like unsold Christmas trees after December 24. The comparison is inappropriate. There was no fixed time at which Maneast shares were sure to become worthless, on the contrary there was a possibility that they would become more valuable. As long as appellant\u2019s operation was going on the future was uncertain. What appellant is really trying to accomplish by the \u201cproject\u201d method of accounting is to set up against the contingency that his inventory might drop in value, a reserve equal to his profit so far on the operation. This is contrary to a fundamental rule of the Income Tax Act that prohibits any \u201creserve, contingent account or sinking fund except as expressly permitted\u201d (section 12(1)(e)). For this reason, no consideration can be given to what appellant testified concerning the extreme uncertainty of the operation:\nMost of those operations are really just glorified crap games. The purchasers of the shares buy them in the hope that if the market goes up they can make money out of the market. In the case of Maneast that was the situation. They were buying into an active market and that was the basis that we sold it on, that if we could get enough buyers into the market the price would go up and they would make a profit on the shares. Our customers were not interested as far as potentialities of the property were concerned; they were interested in what the stock was going to do.\nUnder our Income Tax Act if, for any reason foreseen or unforeseen, an inventory subsequently proves to be worth less than cost or fair market value at the closing date, the taxpayer is entitled to carry back one year and carry forward five years any resulting loss to the extent that it is not applied against income in the year in which it occurs. No alternative is given to set up a reserve against that contingency. This would amount to a deferment of income tax liability.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.G.

The company claimed that its product was exempt from sales tax as being an edible product of fish within the meaning of Schedule III of the Excise Tax Act. The petition of right by which it sought to recover the sum of $355,412.48 it had paid under protest as sales tax during the period April 7, 1963 to February 8, 1964, was dismissed by the Exchequer Court. It was held that the fish oil, and the fish from which it was extracted, had become so obscured by the manufacturing processes and the addition of other ingredients that the resultant margarine could not be considered as a product of fish. The company appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe trade designation of \u201cfish or marine oil margarine\u201d was in such limited use that it could not be considered as of substantial weight in ascertaining the proper description of the goods for the purposes of the Act. The trial judge was fully justified in reaching the conclusion that according to the common understanding margarine was not a product of fish, even when in specialized trading circles a particular kind was known as fish oil margarine. The refined, bleached and deodorized oil was hydrogenated, a process altering its chemical nature to such extent that it was no longer a fish oil, but a derivative of fish oil.\nThe new Schedule III substituted in 1966 by s. 8 of 14-15 Eliz. II, c. 40, could not affect the construction of the schedule as it stood at the material time.\nRevenu\u2014Taxe de vente\u2014Margarine fabriqu\u00e9e en partie avec de l\u2019huile de poisson\u2014Est-elle exempte de la taxe comme produit de poisson\u2014D\u00e9signation commerciale\u2014Loi subs\u00e9quente sans effet sur interpr\u00e9tation\u2014Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise, S.R.C. 1952, c. 100, art. 30(1), 32(1), et Annexe III.\nLa compagnie appelante utilisait comme ingr\u00e9dient principal dans la fabrication de la margarine une huile de poisson dans une proportion variant de 48 pour cent \u00e0 90 pour cent.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Cattanach J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in a matter of sales tax. Appeal dismissed.\nGordon F. Henderson, Q.C., and John D. Richard, for the appellant.\nD.H. Aylen and John E. Smith, for the respondent\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nPIGEON J.:\u2014In 1963 and 1964 appellant, then known as Monarch Fine Foods Limited, was manufacturing margarine. By its petition of right it seeks to recover the sum of $355,412.48 paid under protest for sales tax in respect of the sale of this product between April 7, 1963 and February 8, 1964. The claim for exemption is based on the contention that because a substantial proportion, varying between 48 per cent and 90 per cent, of the oil used as the main component in the manufacture of this butter substitute was herring oil, it is to be considered as an edible product of fish within the meaning of the following item of Schedule III of the Excise Tax Act under the heading \u201cFoodstuffs\u201d:\nFish and edible products thereof;\nCattanach J. dismissed the petition saying:\nIn my view, in order to determine whether a particular product falls within an expression such as \u201cFish and edible products thereof;\u201d resort must be had to the common understanding of such words when used in relation to articles of commerce. The question here is, therefore, whether, in the ordinary use of words, margarine may be fairly regarded as falling within the words, \u201cFish and edible products thereof;\u201d or more specifically, applying such a test: is margarine a product of fish?\nI do not think that, in common parlance, the words \u201cproduct of fish\u201d can be considered as comprehending margarine, even though it contains fish oil as one of its principal ingredients. Margarine is itself a well known article of commerce and is neither marketed, purchased, nor thought of by the consumer as a product of fish.\nIt seems to me that the fish from which oil has been extracted and which is used in the manufacture of margarine, which is by no means the sole ingredient of the end product, has become so obscured by the processes to which it and the oil thereof has been subjected and by the oil being intermingled with substantial amounts of other ingredients from other sources, the whole of which is again the subject of an extensive manufacturing process, that the resultant margarine cannot be considered as a product of fish, even though the fish oil content may make the margarine a fish oil margarine and the labels thereon disclose the fish oil content.\nCounsel for the appellant pointed out that before reaching the above stated conclusion, the trial judge had made a finding \u201cthat any margarine 40 per cent or over of the total oil content of which is fish oil is referred to in the trade as a fish or marine oil margarine\u201d. It must be noted however that this designation does not appear to be used in connection with retail sales. Fish or marine oil margarine is not sold to consumers as a fish product and is almost invariably sold with dairy products in the same way as vegetable oil margarine. A trade designation in such limited use cannot be considered as of substantial weight in ascertaining the proper description of the goods for the purposes with which we are concerned.\nReference was made to the decision of this Court in Townsend v. Northern Crown Bank[2]. In that case, the question was whether sawn lumber was a \u201cproduct of the forest\u201d within the meaning of s. 88 of the Bank Act. Duff J. (as he then was) said (at p. 398):\nThis is only one example of the class of cases in which the court being loath and refusing to attempt to draw an abstract line, finds itself compelled to decide whether a particular concrete case falls on one side or on the other side of the line which theoretically must be found somewhere within given limits. In this particular case I prefer to say that according to the common understanding the articles in question would fairly be comprised within the description \u201cproducts of the forest\u201d, and I think they are within the contemplation of the enactment we have to interpret.\nIn my view, the trial judge applying this test was fully justified in reaching the conclusion that according to the common understanding margarine was not a product of fish, even when in specialized trading circles a particular kind was known as fish oil margarine.\nFurthermore, although in some cases fish oil was the main raw material, in other cases and for a very substantial quantity it was only approximately one half the main raw material, it being mixed with an equal or nearly equal quantity of vegetable oil. Also, it was shown that all the fish oil used was treated to remove any odour or colour identifying it with fish so that, for the consumer, the product would be undistinguishable from margarine made from vegetable oil only. Finally, the refined, bleached and deodorized oil was hydrogenated, a process altering its chemical nature to such extent that, as Dr. Sims said, it was \u201cno longer a fish oil, but a derivative of fish oil\u201d.\nIn his argument in support of the judgment of the Exchequer Court, counsel for the respondent made reference to the new Schedule III of the Excise Tax Act substituted for the former one by s. 8 of 14-15 Eliz. II, c. 40 (assented to July 11, 1966). One of the new items is the following:\n20. Oleomargarine and margarine for consumption in the Province of Newfoundland.\nIt was contended that this amendment of the statute could be considered in construing the former text on the same basis as this Court did consider an amendment of a zoning by-law in construing its original provisions in Wilson v. Jones[3]. I must point out that the two situations are entirely different. In the Wilson case, the amending by-law had been adopted long before the application for the building permit sought to be enjoined. Therefore, the amending by-law was to be considered as making one enactment together with the original by-law. In the present case, however, the tax sought to be recovered was paid in 1963 and 1964 and the petition of right filed in March 1964, long before the amending statute was enacted. In the absence of any declaratory provisions, the 1966 statute cannot have any retrospective operation and the construction of the schedule as it stood at the material time can, in no way, be affected by the later amendment.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

There was no fixed plan as to what the company would do with the property. The farming operations were gradually brought to an end. In 1960, the company leased the property for 25 years to a lessee who was given the option to purchase the land in its entirety or in parcels of not less than 10 acres. In 1962, the lessee exercised his option on part of the land, and in 1963 an additional part was expropriated. The profits realized by the company on the sale and on the expropriation were assessed by the Minister as profits from a business. The assessments were set aside by the Exchequer Court on the ground that the company had committed itself to holding the land as income producing land for 25 years and that the option clause in no way constituted a dedication of the land to a trading operation. The Minister appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe earlier indecision of the company was resolved when the company gave the lease and option. The option was all important. It was the method adopted by the company that put through its real estate transactions. The company was selling its lands in the course of the operation of a business for profit. Consequently, the profits in question were income.

Goodman, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court1 which allowed an appeal from assessments made against Edgeley Farms Limited for its 1962 and 1963 taxation years. The 1962 assessment was on a profit of $23,375 made by the company by selling part of an area of land which it purchased in 1959. The 1963 assessment was on a profit of $3,100 that the company had made as a result of an expropriation of another part of the same area of land. The assessments were set aside on the ground that the profits in question were not profits from a business. On this appeal the Minister contends that the assessments for the 1962 and 1963 taxation years were on such profits.\nThe company was incorporated on December 31, 1958, to acquire the rights of a syndicate which had an agreement to buy lots 6, 7 and 8, Concession 5, Township of Vaughan, containing approximately 350 acres, for the sum of $497,000. The sale was closed on the payment of $150,000 cash and by giving back two mortgages, one for $150,000 and the other for $197,000. The mortgage given back provided for the repayment of principal at the rate of $5,000 per annum on each mortgage and also gave the company the privilege of obtaining a partial discharge on 5 acre lots upon paying the proportionate amount of principal.\nAt the time when the company bought the lands they were being operated as a farm by two estates. The company gradually brought the farming operations to an end and by 1960 had disposed of all the livestock and farm machinery. On May 18, 1960, the company leased the lands to one Samuel Z. Donnenfield. The lease provided for a term of 25 years at an annual rent of $52,800, and gave the lessee the following rights:\n(a) to remove anything on the property and to change grades, remove trees, etc., in connection with the development of the property;\n(b) to purchase the property at any time up until 31 December, 1967, for $875,000;\n(c) to renew the option to purchase for a further eight years provided he arranged for the respondent a new first mortgage for at least $300,000 bearing interest at 7 per cent per annum;\n(d) to exercise the option to purchase from time to time with regard to various parcels of not less than 10 acres, on the basis of paying $2,500 per acre and the rent under the lease being reduced by $150.00 for each acre purchase. The evidence was that in 1962, the company sold 21.25 acres; in 1963 had 2.3 acres expropriated; in 1965 had 2.1 acres expropriated; in 1968 sold 42 acres, and in 1969 had received notice of the exercise of the option to purchase a further 43 acres. Both completed sales were made pursuant to the exercise of the option.\nThe findings of fact of the learned President are contained in the following extracts from his reasons:\nNo attempt was made before me to support the contention put forward at earlier stages of the matter, and suggested in the Notice of Appeal to this Court, that the property was acquired for the purpose of continuing the farming business carried on on the land by the previous owners.\nClearly, as I have said, the land was acquired because it was a good \u201cbuy\u201d. Its potential value was obvious. What the appellant would do with it was not decided at the time of acquisition. The incorporators were well to do and could afford to bide their time. What the appellant would do with the land would depend on what opportunities presented themselves. I have no doubt that, if the guiding mind of the appellant were to have frankly answered questions at the time of acquisition, he would have agreed that the appellant might itself, at an appropriate time, erect on the land buildings suitable for the developing neighbourhood, with a view to renting them or selling them; he would also have agreed that, if the right opportunity or opportunities arose, the appellant might sell some or all of the property, and he would also have agreed that a really attractive bare land leasing proposal would receive careful consideration by the appellant. In other words, the land was not dedicated at the time of acquisition to any particular use. It might end up as stock-in-trade of a trading business or as the subject of a venture in the nature of trade. It might end up as the site for an income-producing building. It might end up as revenue-producing bare land.\nIn those circumstances, had the acquisition merely been followed by the 1962 sale, I should have had no doubt that the resultant profit was a profit from a business within the extended meaning of that word as used in the Income Tax Act. In effect, the appellant would have dedicated the land, or at least that part of it that it sold, to the carrying on of a trading business or a venture in the nature of trade.\nThe ratio of the judgment under appeal is that the company had committed itself to holding the land as income producing land for 25 years and that the option clause in no way constituted a dedication of the land to a trading operation. Here, I think, there is error.\nWhen the company gave this lease and option its earlier indecision was resolved. This is not the \u201cbare land leasing proposal\u201d referred to in the quoted reasons for judgment. The option, in my opinion, is all important. It was the method which the company adopted in putting through its real estate transactions. The property was in a rapidly developing area. The mortgages given back when the property was purchased provided for partial discharges on 5 acre lots. The option was granted within 17 months from the date of acquisition of the property and provided for the purchase of 10 acre parcels. The issue in this appeal is whether the company was selling its lands in the course of the operation of a business for profit. It undoubtedly was and the gains in question are income.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs, and the assessments for the company\u2019s 1962 and 1963 taxation years restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D.S. Maxwell, Ottawa.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Goodman & Carr, Toronto.\n[1] [1968] 2 Ex. C.R. 375, [1968] C.T.C. 240, 68 D.T.C. 5174.\n",

The president of the foundation, one R, was one of two officers who had authority to sign for the plaintiff and he acted as its solicitor throughout the transaction. A solicitor, S, acted for G and MB Co.\nOn the date for closing, viz. November 6, 1962, S delivered to R a cheque for $125,506.82 which represented the balance payable under an arrangement made between S and R to provide for payment of the whole consideration in cash and a reduction of the purchase price. This cheque was drawn by S on the Royal Bank in favour of the plaintiff. It was certified by the Royal Bank. A deed conveying the plaintiff\u2019s property to MB Co. was delivered and registered.\nR on receipt of the cheque signed his own name and forged the signature of his fellow signing officer and then deposited the cheque in his trust account at the Bank of Nova Scotia. The Bank of Nova Scotia sent the cheque for presentation to the Royal Bank. The latter bank received the cheque on November 8, 1962, and paid it the same day. On February 27, 1963, the plaintiff acquired knowledge that the signature of the second signing officer on the endorsement of the cheque had been forged by R, but no notice of the forgery was given to either bank or to S until some two and one-half months later. During the intervening time negotiations were carried on between the plaintiff and R in an effort to obtain restitution from him. However, R absconded before either bank was notified of the forgery.\nOn May 14, 1963, the cheque for $125,506.82 having been endorsed on behalf of the plaintiff by its proper signing officers was presented for payment to the Royal Bank but payment was refused. On the same day, the Royal Bank informed the Bank of Nova Scotia that it looked to it for reimbursement. The Bank of Nova Scotia denied liability to the Royal Bank.\nThe plaintiff brought action against five defendants, claiming against G and MB Co. specific performance of the agreement of purchase and sale, claiming against S as maker of the cheque and claiming against the two banks damages of $125,506.82 for conversion of the cheque. S commenced third party proceedings against both banks claiming indemnity against any liability he might be under to the plaintiff.\nThe trial judge dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action as against the Bank of Nova Scotia on the ground of estoppel. He also dismissed the action as against G and MB Co. He gave judgment for the plaintiff against the Royal Bank and S on the ground that they had suffered no detriment, and so could not rely on the defence of estoppel. He gave judgment for S against both banks in the third party proceedings.\nBoth banks appealed to the Court of Appeal from the judgment against the Royal Bank and S in the main action and from the judgment against the banks in favour of S in the third party proceedings. The plaintiff cross-appealed from the judgment dismissing its action against the Bank of Nova Scotia and from the dismissal of its action against G and MB Co.\nThe Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge that the Bank of Nova Scotia had established a defence of estoppel and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal. Differing from the trial judge, it held that the Royal Bank and S had also suffered detriment and that the plaintiff was estopped as against them from denying that the cheque was properly endorsed. Accordingly, it allowed the appeals of the Royal Bank and S. The third party proceedings taken by S against the banks were necessarily dismissed as well.\nThe plaintiff then appealed to this Court, as against all the defendants, from the dismissal of its action and S served notice of appeal to this Court from the dismissal of the third party proceedings if this Court should find him liable to the plaintiff.\nHeld: The appeals should be dismissed.\nThe action as against G and MB Co. was rightly dismissed. The plaintiff, in view of the terms of the agreement, was estopped from asserting that the agreement had not been performed. The plaintiff had elected to adopt the transaction after it had full knowledge of all that R had done and as to the manner in which the transaction had been closed. As to the claim against the banks and S, the Court agreed with the concurrent findings in the Courts below that these parties were prejudiced by the delay in giving notice of the forgery to them. The defence of estoppel applied to all three parties.\nBy the doctrine of estoppel a person is precluded from denying the truth of the statement acted on for any purpose which results in a detriment to the representee. The plaintiff\u2019s deliberate silence in withholding notification of the forgery destroyed the Bank of Nova Scotia\u2019s opportunities of meeting the claims for indemnity made upon it by its co-defendants, in large part at least, by going against the forger. The plaintiff, therefore, was estopped from denying as against the Royal Bank and S the genuineness of the forged signature.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Grant J. and dismissing plaintiff\u2019s action against all defendants and dismissing third party proceedings. Appeals against all defendants and conditional appeal in third party proceedings dismissed.\nDouglas K. Laidlaw, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nR.E. Holland, Q.C., and W.R. McMurtry, for the defendants, respondents, A.Y. Grozbord and Mont Blanc Holding Co.\nC.F.H. Carson, Q.C., and J.R. Houston, for the defendants, respondents, The Royal Bank of Canada and The Bank of Nova Scotia.\nJ.W. Outerbridge, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent, E. Lawrence Stone.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 dated July 4, 1966, allowing an appeal from the judgment of Grant J. dated December 16, 1964, and dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action against all defendants with costs and dismissing the third party proceedings.\nThe plaintiff is a non-profit corporation incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario and was the owner of certain lands and premises in the City of Toronto known as 565 Jarvis St.\nSamuel Resnick (hereinafter called \u201cResnick\u201d), a barrister and solicitor practising in the City of Toronto, was president of the plaintiff and was one of the two officers having authority to sign for the plaintiff under its relevant by-laws and resolutions.\nThe defendant A.Y. Grozbord (hereinafter called \u201cGrozbord\u201d) was the agent or nominee for the defendant Mont Blanc Holding Company (hereinafter called \u201cMont Blanc\u201d) a partnership consisting of two companies owned or controlled by Grozbord. He entered into the agreement hereinafter referred to on behalf of Mont Blanc.\nThe defendant E. Lawrence Stone (hereinafter called \u201cStone\u201d) was solicitor for the defendant Grozbord and Mont Blanc in connection with the transaction of purchase and sale hereinafter referred to and Resnick acted throughout as solicitor for the plaintiff in the said transaction.\nThe defendant Stone maintained an account at the defendant, the Royal Bank of Canada (hereinafter called \u201cThe Royal Bank\u201d), and Resnick maintained a current, two savings and a trust account at the defendant, the Bank of Nova Scotia.\nOn July 19, 1962, the plaintiff entered into a written agreement of purchase and sale with the defendant Grozbord as trustee to sell 565 Jarvis St. for a price of $150,000 on terms that $2,000 was to be paid down as a deposit, a further $55,000 to be paid on closing subject to adjustments and the balance of the purchase price to be made up by a mortgage to be given back carrying interest at 6 per cent per annum for twelve months from the date of closing.\nBy the terms of the said agreement after adjustment the plaintiff was to receive including the deposit the sum of $56,976.82 in cash and a first mortgage of $93,000.\nThe plaintiff acknowledges having received or having had paid on its behalf or credited in the way of adjustments on the closing of the transaction the total sum of $17,000.\nThe transaction was originally to be closed on September 28, 1962, and the time for closing was extended three times by agreement between the solicitors to October 30, 1962, November 2, 1962, and finally to November 6, 1962.\nResnick received the $2,000 deposit payable to him on July 19, 1962, and deposited this in his trust account at the Bank of Nova Scotia. He received a further $15,000 cheque payable to the plaintiff which he deposited in his trust account on a forged endorsement on November 1, 1962, such monies being received as a condition of the extension of the time for closing.\nSome time between November 2 and November 5, 1962, an arrangement which was not reduced to writing was made between Stone and Resnick to provide for payment of the whole consideration in cash and a reduction in the purchase price to $149,000 subject to adjustments. On the date for closing Stone delivered to Resnick a cheque for $125,506.82 which represented the balance payable in cash on this basis. This cheque was drawn by Stone on the Royal Bank and payable to the plaintiff. It was certified by the Royal Bank. A deed conveying the plaintiff\u2019s property to Mont Blanc Holding Company was delivered and registered.\nThe cheque was deposited by Resnick in his trust account at the Bank of Nova Scotia on November 7, 1962, at which time it bore the following endorsement:\nOntario Woodsworth Memorial Foundation\nPer \u2018S. Resnick\u2019\nPer \u2018Marion H. Bryden\u2019\nFor deposit only\nTo the credit of\nSamuel Resnick\nTrust account\nThe signatures \u201cS. Resnick\u201d and \u201cMarion H. Bryden\u201d were handwritten. It is common ground that the signature of Marion H. Bryden, then the vice-president of the plaintiff, was forged by Resnick.\nThe Bank of Nova Scotia sent the cheque for presentation to the Royal Bank, on which it was drawn. The Royal Bank received the cheque on November 8, 1962, and paid it the same day.\nNeither of the banks had at any time done business with the plaintiff or carried its account or had any knowledge of what persons had authority to endorse cheques on behalf of the plaintiff. The Bank of Nova Scotia deposited the cheque for its customer, Resnick, because it knew and trusted him.\nAt a meeting of the Board of the plaintiff on November 14, 1962, Resnick reported orally that the transaction had been closed, that he had received the $2,000 deposit and $55,016.41 on closing making a total of $57,016.41, that after deducting various expenses there remained a balance of $48,322.31, that he had invested $40,000 of this in a mortgage at 8 per cent for one year and would turn over the balance to the treasurer of the plaintiff.\nThe treasurer, Mrs. Lazarus, gave evidence that Resnick had no previous express authority from the Board to negotiate the cheque received on closing or to invest any of the proceeds, but nevertheless Resnick\u2019s report was accepted by the Board.\nBy letter dated November 22, 1962, Resnick reported to Mrs. Lazarus that the transaction had been completed by the plaintiff receiving the $2,000 deposit, taking back a mortgage for $93,000 and receiving the balance of the purchase price of $150,000 in cash subject to adjustments on closing. He enclosed a cheque for $5,247 drawn on his trust account representing the balance of the cash received on closing after taking in account certain adjustments and the $40,000 invested by him.\nMrs. Lazarus stated that she understood that Resnick had received some $57,000 on behalf of the plaintiff and she assumed he had deposited it in a bank account in his name and that this assumption was confirmed when she received the cheque for $5,247.\nOn February 25, 1963, the plaintiff\u2019s auditor, Mr. Irwin, in the course of a routine accounting investigation, learned from Mont Blanc Holding Company that there was no principal or interest outstanding on any mortgage from it to the plaintiff and in telephone conversations with Grozbord and Stone on February 25 and 26, Irwin learned the manner in which the transaction had been closed and the wording of the endorsement on the cheque for $125,506.82.\nKnowledge that the signature of Marion Bryden on the endorsement of the cheque had been forged by Resnick was acquired by the plaintiff on February 27, 1963.\nOn either March 5 or March 6, 1963, Stone attended on Resnick and obtained his signature as president of the plaintiff to a rectification deed, dated March 5, 1963, correcting an error of description in the deed from the plaintiff to Mont Blanc which had been registered on November 6, 1962. Stone then attended on Mrs. Bryden who, after speaking to Resnick on the telephone, signed the deed as Vice\u2011president and affixed the seal of the plaintiff. This rectification deed was registered on March 7, 1963. No notice of the forgery was given to either bank until on May 9, 1963, the Royal Bank was notified and on May 10, 1963, the Bank of Nova Scotia was notified. Neither bank had any prior knowledge of the forgery. These notifications were given to the banks by telephone by Mr. Holland, solicitor for Grozbord, who had been consulted by Mr. Stone. It appears that on May 3, 1963, Mr. Brewin, the solicitor for the plaintiff, told Stone that there was some question of forgery of a signature in the endorsement of the cheque and that on May 9 at a meeting with Holland and Stone Brewin made it clear that Mrs. Bryden\u2019s signature had been forged.\nThe plaintiff did not at any time notify the defendant Mont Blanc of the forgery.\nI do not find it necessary to set out the details of the negotiations carried on between the plaintiff and Resnick between February 27 and May 9 in an effort to obtain restitution from him as I agree with the concurrent findings in the Courts below that the banks and Stone were prejudiced by the delay in giving notice of the forgery to them.\nEarly in May, before either bank was notified of the forgery, Resnick and his wife left Canada and took up residence in Israel.\nOn May 14, 1963, the cheque for $125,506.82 having been endorsed on behalf of the plaintiff by its proper signing officers was presented for payment to the Royal Bank but payment was refused. On the same day, the Royal Bank informed the Bank of Nova Scotia by letter that it looked to it for reimbursement. The Bank of Nova Scotia replied by letter dated May 17, 1963, denying liability to the Royal Bank.\nThe plaintiff brought action against the five defendants, claiming against Grozbord and Mont Blanc specific performance of the agreement of purchase and sale on the ground that the agreement had not been performed according to its terms and that it had received only part of the purchase price, claiming against Stone as maker of the cheque and claiming against the two banks damages of $125,506.82 for conversion of the cheque. The defendants Grozbord and Mont Blanc commenced third party proceedings against Stone but these proceedings were dismissed at the trial and no appeal was taken from that dismissal.\nStone commenced third party proceedings against both banks claiming indemnity against any liability he might be under to the plaintiff.\nThe learned trial judge dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action as against the Bank of Nova Scotia on the ground of estoppel. He also dismissed the action as against Grozbord and Mont Blanc. He gave judgment for the plaintiff against the Royal Bank and Stone on the ground that they had suffered no detriment, and so could not rely on the defence of estoppel. He gave judgment for Stone against both banks in the third party proceedings, but without costs.\nBoth banks appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario from the judgment against the Royal Bank and Stone in the main action and from the judgment against the banks in favour of Stone in the third party proceedings. The plaintiff cross-appealed from the judgment dismissing its action against the Bank of Nova Scotia and from the dismissal of its action against Grozbord and Mont Blanc.\nThe Court of Appeal, in a judgment delivered by Aylesworth J.A., agreed with the learned trial judge that the Bank of Nova Scotia had established a defence of estoppel and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s cross\u2011appeal. Differing from the learned trial judge, it held that the Royal Bank and Stone had also suffered detriment and that the plaintiff was estopped as against them from denying that the cheque was properly endorsed. Accordingly, it allowed the appeals of the Royal Bank and Stone. Since the plaintiff\u2019s action against Stone was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, the third party proceedings taken by him against the banks were necessarily dismissed as well.\nThe plaintiff now appeals to this Court, as against all the defendants, from the dismissal of its action and Stone has served notice of appeal to this Court from the dismissal of his third party proceedings if this Court should find him liable to the plaintiff.\nI am satisfied that the Court of Appeal has reached the right conclusion. It is stated in the reasons of Aylesworth J.A. that during the course of the argument the Court of Appeal announced its agreement with the learned trial judge on the following points: (i) that Resnick had no authority express, implied or apparent to endorse the cheque for $125,506.82 and deposit it in his trust account and (ii) that such endorsement and deposit were not ratified by the plaintiff. I see no reason to disagree with the first of these propositions but if it were necessary for the decision of this appeal I would find it necessary to examine the second with care and I express no opinion upon it.\nSo far as the claim against the defendants Grozbord and Mont Blanc is concerned, the Court of Appeal, at the conclusion of the argument, dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the dismissal of its action against these two defendants for the reasons given by the learned trial judge. The plaintiff\u2019s claim against these defendants was for specific performance of the agreement of purchase and sale or, in the alternative, damages in the amount of $136,823.50 \u201cbeing the amount of the purchase price and value of the mortgage to be given back to the plaintiff under the said agreement\u201d. I agree with the conclusion of the Courts below that the plaintiff was estopped from asserting that the agreement had not been performed. I am also of opinion that the agreement was in substance performed by the purchaser. A term of the agreement read as follows:\nAny tender of documents or money hereunder may be made upon the Vendor or the Purchaser or any party acting for him and money may be tendered by negotiable cheque certified by a chartered bank or trust company.\nI am unable to agree with the view of the learned trial judge that these words did not authorize the purchaser to pay the purchase price by delivering to the solicitor acting for the vendor at the closing of the transaction a certified cheque payable to the vendor.\nIt was argued for the plaintiff that Resnick had no authority to agree that the whole balance of the purchase price should be paid in cash instead of being satisfied in part by the giving back of a mortgage, but by the terms of the agreement that mortgage was to contain a clause giving the mortgagor the privilege of paying the whole or any part of the principal sum at any time without notice or bonus. If the purchaser wished to pay all cash, as it did, it could have complied literally with the terms of the agreement by tendering a duly executed mortgage and at the same time tendering payment in full thereof. The maxim\u2014lex neminem cogit ad vana seu inutilia peragenda\u2014would seem to be applicable. There remains, however, the question of the effect of Resnick having agreed to a reduction of $1,000 in the purchase price. Whether or not he had ostensible authority to do this, as president as well as solicitor of the plaintiff and as its officer who alone had signed the agreement for sale, need not be decided as it is clear that after it had full knowledge of all that Resnick had done and as to the manner in which the transaction had been closed the plaintiff elected to adopt the transaction. This is shown, amongst other things, by the plaintiff executing and delivering the rectification deed of March 5, 1963, and by its treating the cheque for $125,506.82 as its own, presenting it for payment and proceeding to judgment upon it. For these reasons as well as those dealing with estoppel on which the Courts below proceeded I agree that the plaintiff\u2019s action as against Grozbord and Mont Blanc was rightly dismissed.\nTurning to the claim against the banks and Stone, I agree with the view of both Courts below that the lengthy delay on the part of the plaintiff in notifying each of these parties of the fact that the endorsement on the cheque for $125,506.82 had been forged materially reduced the chances of each of them of recovering from the forger. The duty of the plaintiff to notify these parties of the forgery arose at the latest on March 4, 1963. The course that the plaintiff took is succinctly stated by the learned trial judge as follows:\n...March 4th was the date when all directors of the plaintiff association became aware of such offence on the part of Resnick. They then had direct positive knowledge of forgery and minutes of subsequent meetings of the association reveal that the failure to notify the banks was deliberate and calculated to conceal the forgery until such time as the plaintiff had completed its investigations and decided what it would do. It is significant that no official of the plaintiff ever did notify either bank of the improper endorsement until the cheque was again presented for payment at the Royal Bank on May 14th. The Royal Bank acquired such knowledge from the solicitors for Stone on May 9th and the Bank of Nova Scotia the following day.\nThe reason that moved the learned trial judge to give judgment against the Royal Bank and Stone was that although their chances of recovery from Resnick had been prejudiced they ran no real risk of financial loss as each was entitled to be indemnified by the Bank of Nova Scotia.\nIn the Court of Appeal, Aylesworth J.A., after quoting from the reasons of the learned trial judge, continued as follows:\nWith respect, I take a different view as to the position of both the Royal Bank of Canada and Stone. I also think that the defence of estoppel raised by the Bank of Nova Scotia has a wider application to the plaintiff\u2019s action than accorded it by the learned trial Judge. Dealing first with the Bank of Nova Scotia, it seems to me that the Bank is entitled to say to the plaintiff:\u2014\u2018Your deliberate silence in withholding notification of the forgery has destroyed this Bank\u2019s opportunities of meeting the claims for indemnity made upon it by its co-defendants, in great part at least, by going against the forger; you are therefore estopped from denying as against the Royal Bank and Stone the genuineness of Mrs. Bryden\u2019s signature forged by Resnick; otherwise this Bank suffers as a result of your silence to precisely the same extent as would be the case if it had been unable to demonstrate any loss whatever of opportunity of recoupment from the forger.\u2019 By the doctrine of estoppel a person is precluded from denying for any purposes of the particular transaction in which the estoppel arises, the truth of the statement acted on. Putting it another way, the truth of the statement acted on surely cannot be denied to any degree or for any purpose which results in a detriment to the representee. It is a distinct detriment to the Bank of Nova Scotia to have been deprived of its opportunities to meet the claims of its co-defendants by recoupment from Resnick.\nI agree with all that is said in this passage as applied to the circumstances of this particular case and find it sufficient to support the allowance of the appeals of the Royal Bank and of Stone. Consequently I do not find it necessary to consider the two other grounds upon which Aylesworth J.A. was prepared to allow these appeals, (i) that even if the Royal Bank and Stone were entitled to recover from the Bank of Nova Scotia they have been deprived of their chance of recovering from Resnick, each thus losing one of two strings to his bow, and (ii) that even if entitled to full indemnity from the Bank of Nova Scotia they might well suffer delay and be put to expense in making that recovery.\nAs I find the reasons given above sufficient to dispose of the appeals it becomes unnecessary to consider the arguments advanced by counsel for some of the respondents based on the decisions in Uxbridge Permanent Benefit Building Society v. Pickard[2], and Lloyd V. Grace, Smith & Co.[3] Before parting with the matter I think it only fair to the defendant Stone to say that I have found no support in the record for the criticism of his conduct suggested in the reasons of the learned trial judge and in the joint factum filed in this Court by the respondents the Royal Bank and the Bank of Nova Scotia. He appears to have conducted himself throughout in the manner to be expected of a prudent and competent solicitor acting for the purchaser of a parcel of real estate of substantial value.\nI would dismiss the appeals of the plaintiff against all the defendants with costs. As the plaintiff\u2019s action against Stone is dismissed it follows that his conditional appeal in his third party proceedings against the two banks becomes unnecessary and I would dismiss it but without costs. I would vary the judgment of the Court of Appeal to provide that there be no order as to costs in that Court of the appeal by the banks against Stone in the third party proceedings and in all other respects would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nAppeals dismissed with costs; conditional appeal in third party proceedings dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: McCarthy & McCarthy, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents, A.Y.

William Murray (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nHoar Transport Company Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1969: February 12; 1969: April 22.\nPresent: Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nLabour relations\u2014Collective agreement\u2014Union and company nominees failing to select chairman of arbitration board\u2014Union nominee failing until after prescribed period to request appointment of chairman by Minister\u2014Grievance deemed to have been withdrawn if \u201cgrievance has not been processed by the grievor, his representatives or agents\u201d in accordance with time limit\u2014Whether board had jurisdiction to consider merits of grievance.\nThe appellant union, dissatisfied with the respondent company\u2019s rejection of a discharge grievance, indicated that it wished to proceed to arbitration, as was provided for in their collective bargaining agreement. Appointments of a union nominee and a company nominee to the board of arbitration were made within the time limits stipulated by art. 6.7 of the collective agreement. However, this article also provided that the appointees were to select a chairman within fifteen days of their appointment and that if they failed to do so, then the \u201caggrieved party\u2019s appointee must request in writing within five (5) calendar days,\u201d the Minister of Labour to name a chairman. It was not until after the prescribed period that the union\u2019s nominee B wrote to the Minister requesting that a chairman be appointed. This was done, and later the question was raised as to whether the board of arbitration had jurisdiction to consider the merits of the discharge grievance where there was clearly a failure on the part of the aggrieved party\u2019s appointee to comply with the time limit stipulated in art. 6.7.\nThe board, by a majority, held that it had jurisdiction to hear and determine the grievance. An application by the respondent to quash the proceedings by way of certiorari and for an order to prohibit further proceedings was dismissed. On appeal the Court of Appeal, by a majority, reversed this decision. With leave, an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld (Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: Article 6.8 of the agreement provided that if at any time during the carrying out of the steps laid down in art. 6.7 \u201cthe grievance has not been processed by the grievor, his representatives or agents in accordance with the time limit as prescribed, the grievance shall be deemed to have been withdrawn\u201d. B was well out of time when he wrote to the Minister requesting the appointment of a chairman. He was the \u201caggrieved party\u2019s appointee\u201d for this purpose. He was the only person who could make the request on behalf of the grievor, and he made it as representative of, or as agent of, the grievor. There was no conflict between this position and the quasi-judicial function which he later assumed upon the board being fully constituted.\nArticles 6.7 and 6.8 were integral provisions of the agreement. They created obligations of a basic nature and the parties to the agreement were obliged to adhere to them.\nPer Spence J., dissenting: The scheme of the collective agreement was that although there could be an employee\u2019s grievance that grievance had to be espoused by the union and, therefore, the notice of intention to arbitrate referred to in art. 6.7 which was required to contain the name of the aggrieved party\u2019s appointee to the board of arbitration required that the union, if it were processing either a union grievance or an employee grievance, was the party who should appoint to the board of arbitration. Article 6.8, however, did not refer to the aggrieved party\u2019s appointee but to the grievor, his representatives, or agents. Upon this consideration alone, it was apparent that the default of the union\u2019s appointee under art. 6.7 could not be the default of the grievor or the grievor\u2019s representatives or agents under art. 6.8.\nFurthermore, even if B were the grievor\u2019s appointee not an \u201caggrieved party\u2019s appointee\u201d under art. 6.7, he was not the \u201cgrievor\u2019s representative or agent\u201d within art. 6.8. The function and character of a member of a board of arbitration was exactly opposite to that of a representative or agent. It was of the essence of his duty that such a member must act impartially and under such duty he could not be a representative or agent of anyone whether that party appointed him or not.\n[Union Carbide Canada Ltd. v. Weiler et al., [1968] S.C.R. 966; Port Arthur Shipbuilding Co. v. Arthurs et al., [1969] S.C.R. 85, applied.]\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal from an order of Stark J. dismissing an application for an order of certiorari and prohibition. Appeal dismissed, Spence J. dissenting.\nAubrey E. Golden, for the appellants.\nW.Z. Estey, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The appellant, General Truck Drivers Union, Local 938, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Union\u201d, and the respondent are parties to a collective agreement which contains provisions for the orderly settlement of grievances finally terminating, if necessary, in binding arbitration. The Union, dissatisfied with the respondent\u2019s rejection of a discharge grievance, indicated that it wished to proceed to arbitration, and on November 10, 1966, it appointed appellant Bullock as its nominee to the board of arbitration. On November 16, 1966, the respondent appointed appellant Murray as its nominee.\nThese appointments were within the time limits stipulated by art. 6.7 of the collective agreement. However, this article also provided that the appointees were to select a chairman within fifteen days of their appointment and that if they failed to do so, then the \u201caggrieved party\u2019s appointee must request in writing within five (5) calendar days,\u201d the Minister of Labour for the Province of Ontario to name a chairman. The appellants failed to agree upon a chairman and Bullock did not write to the Minister within the prescribed period. Indeed, it was not until January 4, 1967, that Bullock discussed the matter with Murray and then wrote to the Minister requesting that a chairman be appointed. This was done, and the question in this appeal is whether the board of arbitration had jurisdiction to consider the merits of the discharge grievance where there was clearly a failure on the part of the aggrieved party\u2019s appointee to comply with the time limit stipulated in art. 6.7.\nThe board, by a majority, held that it had jurisdiction to hear and determine the grievance. The respondent\u2019s motion to quash the proceedings by way of certiorari and for an order to prohibit further proceedings was dismissed by Stark J. But on appeal the Court of Appeal, by a majority, reversed this decision. I fully agree with the majority reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal.\nArticle 6.8 provides that if at any time during the carrying out of the steps laid down in art. 6.7 \u201cthe grievance has not been processed by the grievor, his representatives, or agents in accordance with the time limit as prescribed, the grievance shall be deemed to have been withdrawn\u201d. Bullock was well out of time when he wrote to the Minister of Labour for the Province of Ontario requesting the appointment of a chairman. He was the \u201caggrieved party\u2019s appointee\u201d for this purpose. He was the only person who could make the request on behalf of the grievor, and he made it as representative of, or as agent of, the grievor. There is no conflict between this position and his quasi-judicial function. He assumes the latter only at a later stage in the proceedings; that is, upon the board being fully constituted.\nThe board of arbitration is bound by the terms of the collective agreement. Articles 6.7 and 6.8 are integral provisions of the agreement. They create obligations of a basic nature and the parties to the agreement are obliged to adhere to them. The board of arbitration cannot ignore or dilute the force of these obligations, nor change their purport by means of amendment or substitution. This was the view taken by this Court in the recent decisions of Union Carbide Canada Ltd. v. Weiler et al.[2], and Port Arthur Shipbuilding Co. v. Arthurs et al.[3], and these decisions determine the disposition of this appeal.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nSPENCE J. (dissenting):\u2014I have had the opportunity of reading the reasons of my brother Judson and I need not repeat the circumstances which have been outlined with such detail in his reasons.\nI am in agreement that the board of arbitration is bound by the terms of the collective agreement and that arts. 6.7 and 6.8 are integral provisions of the agreement creating an obligation of a basic nature and that the parties to the agreement are obliged to adhere to them.\nI am also of the opinion that s. 86 of the Ontario Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, does not permit the board of arbitration to ignore the exact provisions of the collective agreement and that the failure to comply with such provisions is no mere \u201ctechnical irregularity\u201d. Indeed, counsel for the appellant declined to urge such a submission on this Court.\nWith respect, however, I cannot accept the view that, when Mr. Bullock, the aggrieved party\u2019s appointee, failed to request the Minister of Labour to name a chairman within five days after the expiry of the time for the two arbitrators to agree on the appointment, such an action resulted in the grievance being deemed to have been withdrawn. The majority of the Court of Appeal were of the opinion that such a result was wrought by the provisions of art. 6.8 of the collective agreement. That provision, so far as it is relevant, is as follows:\nIf at any time during the above mentioned steps the grievance has not been processed by the grievor, his representatives, or agents in accordance with the time limit as prescribed, the grievance shall be deemed to have been withdrawn\u2026\nI note that the default which is to have this very serious result is the default of the \u201cgrievor, his representatives or agents\u201d. The default in the present case was that of Mr. Bullock. Mr. Bullock was the exact person upon whom the duty rested in that he was \u201cthe aggrieved party\u2019s appointee\u201d under the provisions of art. 6.7 of the collective agreement. If it had been intended to have included the arbitrator who was appointed by the grievor amongst those whose default would result in the grievance being deemed to have been withdrawn, it would have been extremely easy to have repeated in art. 6.8 the same exact words \u201cthe aggrieved party\u2019s appointee\u201d as had been set out in art. 6.7 rather than have left the question open as to whether such aggrieved party\u2019s appointee could be included in the general words \u201chis representatives or agents\u201d.\nIn art. 6.7, three kinds of grievances are outlined:\n1. an employee grievance,\n2. a member company grievance,\n3. a union grievance.\nThere would seem to be no doubt that the present case is concerned with an employee grievance. I am, however, doubtful that \u201cthe aggrieved party\u2019s appointee\u201d is the employee\u2019s appointee. Although the collective agreement does bear a definition of member companies and of employees, it bears no definition of the word \u201cparty\u201d. The individual employees were not signators of the collective agreement. Throughout the whole of the various paragraphs of art. 6, there is consistent reference to the \u201caggrieved employee\u201d and to the \u201cgrieving employee\u201d but nowhere is the employee referred to as a \u201cparty\u201d. Moreover, art. 6.3 provides:\nDuring any such steps of the grievance procedure, after the grievance has been received in writing the grieving employee must be accompanied by one steward and\/or business agent. This all leads me to believe that the scheme of the collective agreement was that although there could be an employee\u2019s grievance that grievance had to be espoused by the union and that, therefore, the notice of intention to arbitrate referred to in art. 6.7 which was required to contain the name of the aggrieved party\u2019s appointee to the board of arbitration required that the union, if it were processing either a union grievance or an employee grievance, was the party who should appoint to the board of arbitration. Article 6.8, however, does not refer to the aggrieved party\u2019s appointee but to the grievor, his representatives, or agents. Upon this consideration alone, it is apparent that the default of the union\u2019s appointee under art. 6.7 cannot be the default of the grievor or the grievor\u2019s representatives or agents under art. 6.8.\nI am, however, further of the opinion that art. 6.8 need not be interpreted as causing the grievance to be deemed to be withdrawn even if art. 6.7 did provide that the notice should contain the name of the grievor\u2019s appointee rather than \u201cthe aggrieved party\u2019s appointee\u201d as it does. I do not think so because I am of the opinion that the function and character of a member of a board of arbitration is exactly opposite to that of a representative or agent. It is of the essence of his duty that such a member must act impartially and under such duty he could not be a representative or agent of anyone whether that party appointed him or not.\nIt was the view of Aylesworth J.A., giving the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that such appointee\u2019s \u201cquasi-judicial function of arbitration begins with the constitution of the board, not before, and the board, of course, cannot be constituted and cannot enter upon its functions until after the appointment of a chairman\u201d. With respect, I am unable to agree with the view that the character of an arbitrator changes from that of an agent to that of an impartial adjudicator after a chairman has been appointed in the ordinary course by the act of that very member of the board and the board commences its deliberations. Any such mystical translation of functions is unnecessary for the proper conception of the position and duty of an arbitrator.\nIn Veritas Shipping Corporation v. Anglo-Canadian Cement, Ltd.[4], Mr. Justice McNair considered an appli- cation to remove one Wallersteiner from a board of arbitration. The arbitration was one provided for by a clause in the charter-party which clause called on each party, i.e., the owners and charterers, to nominate a member of the board. The charterer purported to nominate its own managing director as the arbitrator and, in fact, Dr. Wallersteiner, as such managing director of the charterer, actually executed the document appointing himself the arbitrator. The submission made by the shipowners was that Dr. Wallersteiner had misconducted himself in the arbitration in appointing himself, having been managing director of the charterer. McNair J. said at p. 77:\nI am quite satisfied that it would be quite wrong for him to be allowed to continue to act as arbitrator in a dispute of this nature. It is quite true that under the clause, if the two arbitrators disagree and the matter is referred to the umpire for his decision, the arbitrators, according to the customary way in which these matters are dealt with in the City of London, may if they so wish act as advocates. They need not do so but there is nothing wrong in them doing so. Until that moment arrives, the arbitrators must not only act judicially and show no bias at all but must also appear to be in a position to act judicially and without any bias.\nTherefore, it was McNair J.\u2019s view that so soon as the arbitrator was appointed his judicial and impartial function became operative. In the present case, for the same reasons, Mr. Bullock\u2019s judicial and impartial function became operative so soon as he was appointed as the aggrieved party\u2019s appointee to the board. In fact, the very act of choosing the chairman of the board was a duty he was required to perform judicially and without bias.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that, as I have said, even if Mr. Bullock were the grievor\u2019s appointee not an \u201caggrieved party\u2019s appointee\u201d under art. 6.7, he was not the \u201cgrievor\u2019s representative or agent\u201d within art. 6.8.\nI am assisted in coming to this conclusion by the circumstance, referred to by Mr. Justice Laskin in his dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that the words \u201cthe grievor, his representatives or agents\u201d in art. 6.8 have ample subject-matter in art. 6 to which the words might refer other than the aggrieved party\u2019s appointee. Throughout it and the preceding articles of the agreement, many examples of representative or agent character of either the member company or the union are given. Any one of those representatives or agents could be \u201cthe grievor, his representatives or agents\u201d in art. 6.8.\nFor these reasons, I would allow the appeal with costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of Stark J., dismissing the motion for certiorari with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, SPENCE J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Aubrey E.

Prior even to the birth of the child she consulted the Children\u2019s Aid Society of Ottawa as to the child about to be born being given into custody of that organization subsequent to its birth. On October 26, 1967, upon the application of the Society, a judge of the Family Court made an order whereby he found that the child was a child in need of protection. Exercising the jurisdiction conferred in s. 25(c) of The Child Welfare Act, 1965 (Ont.), c. 14, he made the infant a ward of the Crown and committed him to the care of the Society.\nOn January 24, 1968, the appellant wrote to the social worker of the Society and said as to her infant son, \u201cbut now I want him back\u201d, but on February 23, 1968, in reply to a letter from the social worker, she asked that the earlier request be disregarded. However, by a letter of April 10, 1968, the appellant again applied for the return of her son. In the interim, the appellant\u2019s mother for the first time had discovered the birth of the child and she and her husband were anxious to take the appellant back into their home and to care for the child. On April 18, the social worker replied stating that the infant had been placed with adopting parents and that \u201cwe cannot disturb this arrangement\u201d. Subsequently, the appellant applied to the Juvenile and Family Court under s. 35 of The Child Welfare Act for an order for the production of the infant and for a further order for the delivery of the said infant to the applicant. The application was dismissed. On an appeal under s. 36 of the Act, a County Court judge allowed the appeal, terminated the order of October 26, 1967, and directed that the child be produced and delivered to the appellant. An appeal from this decision to the Court of Appeal was allowed on the ground that s. 25(c) of the Act provided \u201cthat the child be made a ward of the Crown until the wardship is terminated under section 31 or 34\u201d, and that, therefore, no application could be made by a parent under the provisions of s. 35 of the Act when a child had been so made a ward of the Crown under the provisions of s. 25(c). With leave, an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld (Judson and Hall JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the case returned to the Court of Appeal for consideration upon the merits.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Martland and Spence JJ.: Under s. 31 of The Child Welfare Act the Children\u2019s Aid Society having the care of the child could apply to terminate the wardship order, and under s. 34 the wardship would terminate when the child reached the age of 18. But a Court should not be forced to the conclusion that the whole determination of whether the mother should have the custody of her child returned to her is to be left for the Children\u2019s Aid Society so that that society by simply refusing to make an application provided for by s. 31 could bar the mother having a Court consider a change of circumstances and what might well be not only to her advantage but to the advantage of the welfare of the child.\nWhile there was truth in the submission that such an interpretation of the section is necessary in order to permit the efficient operation of the procedure for the adoption of children who have been made wards of the Crown, and that proposed adopting parents will not take a child preparatory to adopting the said child if their custody of the child and their opportunity to secure the adoption of that child is imperilled by the possibility that the parent or parents of the child might at any time prior to the granting of an adoption order make an application to have the child returned thereby disrupting all the plans of the proposed adopting parents and causing them a considerable emotional upset, this should not persuade the Court to find that the most important right of a natural parent has been taken from such natural parent merely by implication. Consent of the natural parent to the original order which made the infant a ward of the Crown is often and perhaps usually given under conditions when such natural parent, almost inevitably the mother, is under a condition of almost intolerable stress.\nAccordingly, s. 35 of the Act permitted the application of the natural mother for production of the child even when that child was a ward of the Crown and, therefore, the Family Court judge had jurisdiction to consider such application by the present appellant and the County Court judge had jurisdiction to consider an appeal from the Family Court judge\u2019s refusal of the application.\nPer Judson and Hall JJ., dissenting: Under s. 32 of The Child Welfare Act, the Crown is made the legal guardian and has the care, custody and control of a child designated as a Crown ward. It has the obligation to secure adoption of the child under s. 84(1). By s. 73(3) the natural parent\u2019s consent is dispensed with in the case of a Crown ward in adoption proceedings under Part IV of the Act.\nIt followed that the Legislature intended, by s. 25(c), that once a child was designated as a Crown ward, the natural parent was to be accorded no recourse other than the right to appeal, and the order designating the child as a Crown ward was not to be terminated except as provided in s. 31 or when the child attained the age of 18. The power of the Legislature to so enact could not be questioned: Reference re Adoption Act, etc., [1938] S.C.R. 398.\nThe plain words of s. 25(c) \u201cthat the child be made a ward of the Crown until the wardship is terminated under section 31 or 34\u201d could not be read as being nullified by the opening words of s. 35(1). The two subsections have a place in the scheme of things contemplated by the Act. Section 25(c) does not deprive s. 35(1) of effect. Section 35(1) still applies to wards of children\u2019s aid societies who are not Crown wards namely, those so designated under s. 25(b) and to whom s. 31(1) does not apply.\n[Fortowsky v.

Leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the Court on October 21, 1968.\nThe appellant Sylvia Elaine Mugford gave birth to a child, David John Mugford, on October 5, 1967. At that time, Sylvia Elaine Mugford was unmarried and between 19 and 20 years of age. She was living temporarily with a sister in Ottawa and her mother did not know of her pregnant condition. Prior even to the birth of the child, she had consulted the Children\u2019s Aid Society of Ottawa as to the child about to be born being given into custody of that organization subsequent to its birth. On October 26, 1967, upon the application of the Children\u2019s Aid Society of Ottawa, His Honour Judge Robert Good, a judge of the Family Court, made an order whereby he found that the infant David John Mugford was a child in need of protection. Exercising the jurisdiction conferred in s. 25(c) of The Child Welfare Act, 1965 (Ont.), c. 14, to which reference shall be made hereafter, he made the said David John Mugford a ward of the Crown and committed him to the care of the Children\u2019s Aid Society of Ottawa.\nOn January 24, 1968, Miss Mugford wrote to the social worker with the Children\u2019s Aid Society of Ottawa and said as to her infant son, \u201cbut now I want him back\u201d. The social worker replied thereto suggesting that Miss Mugford should come and discuss the matter with her but on February 23, 1968, Miss Mugford replied to that letter asking the social worker to disregard her earlier request. Part of that letter is of some relevance to these considerations. Miss Mugford said, in part:\nI\u2019m sorry for causing so much inconvenience but I have been very upset lately and didn\u2019t know which way to turn. I didn\u2019t answer your letter immediately because I was in the process of really trying to straighten myself out and wanted to be sure. As it is now I don\u2019t see how I will be able to take the baby back because I don\u2019t feel worthy of him. I will always want him but I don\u2019t feel I have that extra something that it takes to devote my life to raising him.\nFurther in the letter, Miss Mugford said:\nPlease let me know as soon as he is adopted; I am planning to move away soon and I would like to know exactly how everything is with him before I leave.\nBy her letter of April 10, 1968, Miss Mugford again renewed her application to have her son David John Mugford returned to her. The evidence reveals that in the interim Miss Mugford\u2019s mother had for the first time discovered the birth of the child and she and her husband were most anxious to take Miss Mugford back into her home and to care for the child. To that letter, the social worker replied on April 18 stating that the infant had been placed with adopting parents in mid-March and that \u201cwe cannot disturb this arrangement\u201d. On May 27, 1968, through her solicitor, Miss Mugford applied to the Juvenile and Family Court of the City of Ottawa and County of Carleton under the provisions of s. 35 of The Child Welfare Act for an order for the production of the infant and for a further order for the delivery of the said infant to the applicant. That application was considered by His Honour Judge Good, the same judicial officer who had, as a judge of the Family Court, jurisdiction under s. 25(c) of The Child Welfare Act, and who had ordered on October 26, 1967, that the infant should be a ward of the Crown. His Honour Judge Good\u2019s formal order dismissing Miss Mugford\u2019s application appears under date of June 24, 1968, which would appear to have been the date of the hearing. His Honour Judge Good, however, delivered careful and detailed reasons dated July 5, 1968. An appeal therefrom in accordance with the provisions of s. 36 of The Child Welfare Act was taken to the presiding judge in chambers for the County Court of the County of Carleton. After a hearing and with detailed and carefully considered reasons, by an order made on August 13, 1968, His Honour Judge Honeywell allowed the appeal, terminated the order of October 26, 1967, and directed that the child be produced and delivered to Miss Mugford. From this order, the Children\u2019s Aid Society of Ottawa appealed to the Court of Appeal in accordance with s. 36(2) of The Child Welfare Act, and those persons with whom the infant had been placed and who hoped to become the adopting parents applied to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal the said order of the County Court judge.\nThe appeal came on for hearing on October 1, 1968, and, for reasons given by Kelly J.A., the appeal was allowed upon the ground that s. 25(c) of The Child Welfare Act provided \u201cthat the child be made a ward of the Crown until the wardship is terminated under section 31 or 34\u2026\u201d, and that, therefore, no application could be made by a parent under the provisions of s. 35 of the said statute when a child had been so made a ward of the Crown under the provisions of s. 25(c) of the statute. Whether or not this is the effect of the statute was the subject of the argument in this Court. Although the present Child Welfare Act is a new statute first enacted in 1965, it contains many statutory provisions which had appeared in earlier statutes. Section 35 has appeared in various forms in the statutory provisions for about sixty years, and the present section is largely a repetition of that which appeared in The Child Welfare Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 53, s. 30. The only revisions wrought in the new statute were to provide, firstly, that the application under s. 35 should be made \u201cto a judge of the Supreme Court\u201d, and, secondly, that the words in the original section that the judge should refuse to enforce \u201chis [the parent\u2019s] right to the custody of the child\u201d have been replaced by the words \u201cthat the child is in need of protection\u201d.\nIn Fortowsky v. Roman Catholic Children\u2019s Aid Society for County of Essex[2], the Court of Appeal for Ontario considered an appeal arising under circumstances surprisingly similar to those of the present case. There the application had been made by the parent, under the provisions of The Infants Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 187, to a judge of the Surrogate Court of the County of Essex. At that time, there was in effect The Child Welfare Act, 1954 (Ont.), c. 8. Section 27(1) of that statute provided:\n27.\u2014(1) Where a parent applies to a judge of the Supreme Court for an order for the production of a child committed under this Part and the judge is of the opinion that the parent has neglected or deserted the child or that he has otherwise so conducted himself that the judge should refuse to enforce his right to the custody of the child, the judge may in his discretion decline to make the order.\nAylesworth J.A. delivered the judgment of the Court in which he held that the Court was by the provisions of the said Child Welfare Act deprived of its jurisdiction under the general provisions of s. 1(1) of The Infants Act when the child had been made a permanent ward of the Children\u2019s Aid Society. At p. 236 of the note it is said:\nAll the provisions of Part II expressed overwhelmingly the intention of the legislature to deal specifically by special provisions with all matters relevant to the protection, care and custody of neglected children and the legislature by these enactments, as it were, segregated all such questions with respect to this specific class of infants to be dealt with by those special provisions only and not to be dealt with at large under the provisions of the Infants Act. Under Part II a parent seeking to regain the custody of a neglected child must bring an application for that purpose, before a Judge of the Supreme Court: s. 27. Upon such an application the Judge was required to give specific consideration to all those matters with respect to which provision was made in the Part. It was true that the provisions of s. 27 having to do with the issue of custody of a neglected child, were phrased somewhat in the negative, rather than in the positive, in referring to the powers of a Judge of the Supreme Court. That, however, was immaterial. A Judge of the Supreme Court or a Judge of the Surrogate Court were given general jurisdiction over questions of custody by the provisions of the Infants Act. The Child Welfare Act, Part II simply carved out of that general jurisdiction the powers which a Judge of the Surrogate Court otherwise would have and set up provisions for the guidance of a Judge of the Supreme Court when application was made to him by a parent with respect to a neglected child.\nIt should be noted that the order which the Surrogate Court judge purported to vary was an order made under the provisions of s. 16(8)(c) of The Child Welfare Act, 1954, which provided:\n16. (8) Where the judge finds the child to be a neglected child he shall make an order,\n* * * *\n(c) that the child be committed permanently to the care and custody of the children\u2019s aid society;\nSubsection (14) of the said s. 16 provided:\n(14) Where a judge has made an order under clause c of subsection 8, the society may at any time during the period of permanent commitment and upon at least thirty days notice in writing to the Director, bring the case before a judge to determine if the welfare of the child might best be served by the termination of such permanent commitment and if the judge is satisfied that such action is in the interest of the welfare of the child, he shall terminate the commitment.\nand subsection (16) of the said s. 16 provided:\n(16) Where a child has been permanently committed to the care and custody of a society, the society shall be the legal guardian of such ward until he has attained the age of eighteen years, or until he is adopted under Part IV,\u2026or until the wardship is terminated by a judge under subsection 14, or until an extended guardianship under subsection 17 terminates.\nIt would, therefore, appear that with the exception that the application under the present s. 35 of The Child Welfare Act is made to a \u201cjudge\u201d, defined in s. 19(1)(d) as being a judge of a Juvenile and Family Court, while the application under s. 27 of The Child Welfare Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 53, was made to a judge of the Supreme Court, all the other relevant provisions of the statute are similar. I cannot see that the fact that the earlier statutory provisions were that the child should be made a permanent ward of the society while the present provisions are that the child should be a ward of the Crown can affect the matter; nor can I see that the alteration of the words \u201cto enforce the right to the custody of the child\u201d to the words \u201cthat the child is in need of protection\u201d require any different interpretation of the section. It was very plainly Aylesworth J.A.\u2019s opinion that the parent could have made an application not to the Surrogate judge under the provisions of s. 1(1) of The Infants Act, as the parent in the Fortowsky case purported to apply, but rather to a Supreme Court judge under the provisions of the then s. 27 of The Child Welfare Act, for the learned justice in appeal said at p. 237:\nIf the mother was sincere in her wish for the custody of her child\u2014and the record gave every indication of such sincerity\u2014the question of custody would remain to be decided, if necessary, upon an application to a Judge of the Supreme Court for custody of the child, on notice, of course, to the society.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the ratio decidendi of the Court of Appeal in the present case and of the same Court in the Fortowsky case are in exact opposition. If an application could have been made by a parent under the provisions of s. 27 of The Child Welfare Act, 1954, c. 8, as to a child who had been made a permanent ward of the society under the provisions of s. 16 of that statute then, similarly, the application may be made by a parent under s. 35 of the present Child Welfare Act as to an infant who had been made a ward of the Crown under the provisions of s. 25(c) of the latter statute.\nIn support of the submission that the interpretation of s. 35 made by the Court of Appeal in the present case is the correct one, it has been said that the original order made by His Honour Judge Good on October 26, 1967, was subject to appeal under s. 36 of The Child Welfare Act, that there is no limitation on the time for such appeal and that, therefore, the present appellant instead of taking the procedure under s. 35 of The Child Welfare Act could have appealed that original order. This argument seems to me to exhibit a misconception of the purpose of appeal. It is not the appellant\u2019s contention that the order made by His Honour Judge Good on October 26, 1967, was in error. She had appeared to support that application, she was represented by counsel, and she was carefully warned of her rights but believed at that time and under the circumstances which then prevailed that the only way in which the interest of her infant child could be protected properly was by the making of such order. No matter what extension of time might be obtained to permit such an appeal and no matter what other evidence might be permitted upon such an appeal, it would be the duty of the judicial officer hearing the appeal, i.e., the judge of the County Court of the County of Carleton, to consider the appeal on the circumstances which prevailed at the time the order appealed from was made. Any attempt to bring in the subsequent most important circumstances as to the mother\u2019s present ability to care for her infant and the offer of her mother and step\u2011father to assist her, as they are well able to do, could not affect the validity of the order as originally made.\nKelly J.A., in giving reasons for the Court of Appeal, said:\nThe order under s. 25(c) had the effect of making the child a ward of the Crown until the wardship be terminated under s. 31 or s. 34 of The Child Welfare Act, 1965. No proceedings with respect to the termination of the wardship under either of those sections are before the Court or have been taken. It is the view of this Court that the application was misconceived and that no power lay in the Judge under s. 35 to make any order with respect to a wardship under s. 25(c) that had not been terminated.\nAs I have pointed out, to attribute that exclusive character to s. 25(c) is contrary to the view of Aylesworth J.A. as outlined in the Fortowsky case, supra. It would appear, moreover, not to be in accordance with the other provisions of The Child Welfare Act. As Kelly J.A. pointed out, an order under s. 25(c) is subject to an appeal. Part IV of The Child Welfare Act makes the provision for adoption and Part IV is not referred to as an exception under s. 25(c). The inevitable effect of s. 82, which appears in the said Part IV, is to terminate any wardship as by subs. (1) the adopted child becomes the child of the adopting parents. There is some indication that unless and until that adoption takes place the natural parent still maintains rights. Section 73(3) provided that the only consent required to the adoption of a child which is a Crown ward is the consent of the Director. Apart from that provision, the natural parent, by the provisions of s. 73(2), would have been required to consent.\nIn Re Minister of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation and Dub\u00e9[3], Culliton C.J.S., giving judgment for the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, considered an appeal from an order made granting the custody of a child to its father. The child had been found, by a Family Court judge, to have been abandoned and it had been committed to the Minister, that being the provision of the Saskatchewan statute rather than granting wardship to the Crown as in Ontario. An appeal had been taken to a judge in chambers and that appeal had been dismissed. The father then made an application to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench under the provisions of The Infants\u2019 Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 306, for custody of the child. This order was granted and an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal. Culliton C.J.S. said at p. 304:\nThe primary question raised by this appeal is whether when there is an existing committal order under Part I of the Child Welfare Act, the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench has jurisdiction to entertain an application for custody.\nThe Fortowsky case, supra, was cited as an authority for the depriving of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of such jurisdiction. The learned Chief Justice of Saskatchewan refused to follow such case pointing out that the Ontario statute, i.e., The Child Welfare Act, 1954, c. 8, contained the provision in s. 27 to which I have already referred and that such provision was not reproduced in the Saskatchewan statute. At pp. 307-8 he said:\nI would also point out that an order for custody made by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench is not a final judgment. It is not a decision which terminates for all time the rights of the parents or either of them. The Court always has the right, under changed conditions, to make a new order, notwithstanding the existence of the previous order. To give effect to the contention of learned counsel for the appellant, would be to give to a committal order a finality not provided for in a custody order. This, in my view, would so drastically terminate the rights of the parents that such effect should not be given thereto in the absence of express language.\n(The italicizing is my own.)\nIn Hepton and Hepton v. Matt[4], the present Chief Justice of this Court found reason to repeat his statement in Martin v. Duffell[5], and such statement received the expressed approval of Rand J. in the same case. There, the present Chief Justice said:\n...I regard it as settled law that the natural parents of an infant have a right to its custody which, apart from statute, they can lose only by abandoning the child or so misconducting themselves that in the opinion of the Court it would be improper that the child should be allowed to remain with them, and that effect must be given to their wishes unless \u201cvery serious and important reasons\u201d require that, having regard to the child\u2019s welfare, they must be disregarded. I think that view is sound basis for a disinclination to find that the statute has deprived the natural parent of any right to apply for a variation of the order making a child the ward of the Crown unless it so provides in express words. On the interpretation urged by the respondent in the present appeal, upon the order having been made originally on October 26, 1967, and properly made for what then existed as good and sufficient cause, no matter what change in circumstances took place, the mother was forever barred from making an application to the Court for the custody of her own child. It is true that under s. 31 of The Child Welfare Act the Children\u2019s Aid Society having the care of the child might then determine that the welfare of the child would justify termination of the wardship order and itself apply, and under s. 34 the wardship would terminate when the child reached eighteen years of age. Surely a Court should not be forced to the conclusion that the whole determination of whether the mother should have the custody of her child returned to her is to be left for the Children\u2019s Aid Society so that that society by simply refusing to make an application provided for by s. 31 could bar the mother having a Court consider a change of circumstances and what might well be not only to her advantage but to the advantage of the welfare of the child.\nIt is said such an interpretation of the section is necessary in order to permit the efficient operation of the procedure for the adoption of children who have been made wards of the Crown, and it is to be noted that s. 84(1) of The Child Welfare Act provides that every Children\u2019s Aid Society should endeavour to secure the adoption of Crown wards. It is argued that proposed adopting parents will not take a child preparatory to adopting the said child if their custody of the child and their opportunity to secure the adoption of that child is imperilled by the possibility that the parent or parents of the child might at any time prior to the granting of an adoption order make an application to have the child returned thereby disrupting all the plans of the proposed adopting parents and causing them a considerable emotional upset. There is truth in this submission but I cannot feel that even that should persuade this Court to find that the most important right of a natural parent has been taken from such natural parent merely by implication. It must be remembered that the consent of the natural parent to the original order which made the infant a ward of the Crown is often and perhaps usually given under conditions when such natural parent, almost inevitably the mother, is under a condition of almost intolerable stress, and to attribute the degree of finality argued for by the respondent to her consent under those circumstances is a course which I find most difficult to follow.\nFor these reasons, I am of the opinion that s. 35 of The Child Welfare Act permits the application of the natural mother for production of the child even when that child is a ward of the Crown and that, therefore, His Honour Judge Good had jurisdiction to consider such application by the present appellant and His Honour Judge Honeywell had jurisdiction to consider an appeal from His Honour Judge Good\u2019s refusal of the application.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario based its decision only on this question of jurisdiction and having expressed its view that no such jurisdiction existed did not deal with the merits of the appeal. His Honour Judge Good came to one conclusion in carefully detailed reasons and His Honour Judge Honeywell, on appeal from His Honour Judge Good, came to the opposite conclusion, again in carefully detailed reasons. It would seem that those merits should be dealt with by the Court of Appeal for Ontario and it is, therefore, my view that this appeal should be returned to the Court of Appeal for Ontario for consideration upon the merits.\nNeither before His Honour Judge Good nor before His Honour Judge Honeywell, nor in the Court of Appeal for Ontario were any costs allowed. I would, therefore, not make any provision for costs in this appeal.\nThe judgment of Judson and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nHALL J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts are set out in the reasons of my brother Spence. The merits of the appellant\u2019s application for the production and delivery to her of the infant David John Mugford are not in issue in this appeal. The only question for determination is whether His Honour Judge Good had jurisdiction to entertain the application, having regard to s. 25(c) of The Child Welfare Act, 1965 (Ont.), c. 14. The Court of Appeal held that His Honour Judge Good was without jurisdiction.\nThere is no question as to the validity of the original order made by His Honour Judge Good on October 26, 1967, wherein he found the child David John Mugford to be a child in need of protection and under s. 25 of The Child Welfare Act, which reads:\n25. Where the judge finds the child to be a child in need of protection, he shall make an order,\n(a) that the case be adjourned sine die and that the child be placed with or returned to his parent or other person subject to supervision by the children\u2019s aid society; or\n(b) that the child be made a ward of and committed to the care and custody of the children\u2019s aid society having jurisdiction in the area in which the child was taken into the protective care of the society for such period, not exceeding twelve months, as in the circumstances of the case he considers advisable; or\n(c) that the child be made a ward of the Crown until the wardship is terminated under section 31 or 34 and that the child be committed to the care of the children\u2019s aid society having jurisdiction in the area in which the child was taken into the protective care of the society.\nHe elected to act under cl. (c) above and ordered:\n(a) that the child be made a ward of the Crown and committed to the care of the Children\u2019s Aid Society of Ottawa commencing 26th October, 1967.\nAlthough s. 36 of The Child Welfare Act gives a right of appeal, no appeal was taken from this order. In fact the order was made with the mother\u2019s consent three weeks after the birth of the child and after she had been counselled and advised by Mr. Brian Golding, who acted as guardian ad litem.\nAs will be seen, s. 25 above recognizes two types of wardship. The first, under cl. (b), provides for a child being made a ward of, and committed to, the care and custody of the Children\u2019s Aid Society having jurisdiction in the area in which the child was taken into protective custody; and the second, under cl. (c) that the child be made a ward of the Crown until the condition is terminated under s. 31 or 34.\nIt is only in respect of an order made under cl. (c) that the condition is to continue until terminated under s. 31 or 34.\nSection 31 reads:\n31. (1) Where a child has been committed as a ward of the Crown, the children\u2019s aid society having the care of the child may apply to a judge for an order terminating the Crown wardship, and, if the judge is satisfied that the termination is in the best interests of the child, he shall order that the Crown wardship be terminated. (2) Within twelve months after a Crown ward is admitted to an institution under The Mental Hospitals Act, other than an examination unit, the children\u2019s aid society responsible for the care of the child shall, upon notice to the superintendent of the mental institution, apply to a judge for an order terminating the Crown wardship, and, if the judge is satisfied that the termination of the wardship is in the best interests of the child, he shall order that the Crown wardship be terminated.\nand provides for termination of a Crown wardship unilaterally on an application by the Children\u2019s Aid Society having the care of the child. No similar provision is provided for in this section in favour of anyone else.\nSection 34 reads:\n34. Every wardship terminates when the ward attains the age of eighteen years, but, upon the application of a children\u2019s aid society with the approval of the Director, a judge may order that the wardship of a Crown ward continue until the ward attains the age of twenty-one years where the ward is dependent for educational purposes or because of mental or physical incapacity.\nand has no application here.\nThat leaves s. 35(1) which reads:\n35. (1) Where a parent applies to a judge for an order for the production of a child committed under this Part and the judge is of the opinion that the parent has deserted the child or that he has otherwise so conducted himself that the child is in need of protection, the judge may in his discretion decline to make the order.\nand it is under this section that the appellant applies to terminate the Crown wardship. Kelly J.A., speaking for himself, MacKay and MacGillivray JJ.A., said:\nUnder the scheme of The Child Welfare Act the Judge, as therein defined and within which definition came His Honour Judge Good who made the order of 26th October 1967, may make orders, under s. 25, in respect of a child whom he finds to be \u201cin need of protection\u201d, which phrase is defined in s. 19(1)(b) of the Act. The order of Judge Good did find that this child was a child in need of protection. Having made such a finding, the Judge was authorized to make one of several orders. The order which he chose to make was made under s. 25(c) and must be taken to have been made judicially on the facts before him. No proceedings have been taken to set aside or appeal from that particular order. The order under s. 25(c) had the effect of making the child a ward of the Crown until the wardship be terminated under s. 31 or s. 34 of The Child Welfare Act. No proceedings with respect to the termination of the wardship under either of those sections are before the Court or have been taken. It is the view of this Court that the application was misconceived and that no power lay in the Judge under s. 35 to make any order with respect to a wardship under s. 25(c) that had not been terminated. It follows that neither of the Courts below had jurisdiction to deal with the application and the proper order would be that the order appealed from be varied and as varied provide that the proceedings before the Judge of the Juvenile Court be quashed for want of jurisdiction. It was argued in this Court that this result was in conflict with the decision of the Court of Appeal in Fortowsky v. Roman Catholic Children\u2019s Aid Society for County of Essex[6], in which Aylesworth J.A., in dismissing an application for custody on the grounds quoted by my brother Spence in his reasons, continued as follows [pp. 573-74 (D.L.R.)]:\nFor these reasons I conclude that the appeal must succeed. Having come to that conclusion it is unnecessary to deal with the merits of the respondent mother\u2019s application. If the mother is sincere in her wish for the custody of her child and the record gives very indication of such sincerity, the question of custody will remain to be decided, if necessary, upon an application to a Judge of the Supreme Court for production and for custody of the child, on notice, of course, to the appellant. I say \u201cif necessary\u201d because the appellant if convinced that it is in the best interests of the child\u2019s welfare to restore custody to the respondent (and upon the evidence before him the Surrogate Court Judge was so convinced) may decide to expedite the matter by itself upon notice to the mother making application under s. 16 (14) of the special Act; otherwise the respondent must be left to the legal remedy which is hers under s. 27.\n(Emphasis added.)\nIt is on this reference to s. 27 that the appellant relies.\nSection 27 referred to by Aylesworth J.A. then read:\n27.(1) Where a parent applies to a judge of the Supreme Court for an order for the production of a child committed under this Part and the judge is of the opinion that the parent has neglected or deserted the child or that he has otherwise so conducted himself that the judge should refuse to enforce his right to the custody of the child, the judge may in his discretion decline to make the order.\nSection 35(1) with some amendments replaced s. 27 of the 1954 Act which was the operative section when Fortowsky was decided.\nBy one amendment the judge in s. 35(1) is a judge of a Juvenile and Family Court (s. 19(1)(d) of the 1965 Act) in lieu of a judge of the Supreme Court. Other changes were made in the wording of the section which are not relevant to this appeal.\nWhen the Fortowsky case was decided in March 1960, the application having been made May 7, 1959, the present s. 25 was then s. 16(8) of The Child Welfare Act 1954, c. 8, and read:\n(8) Where the judge finds the child to be a neglected child he shall make an order, (a) that the case be adjourned sine die and that the child be returned to his parent or guardian or other person in whose charge he is, subject to supervision by the children\u2019s aid society; or\n(b) that the child be committed temporarily to the care and custody of the children\u2019s aid society for such period, not exceeding twelve months, as in the circumstances of the case he considers advisable; or\n(c) that the child be committed permanently to the care and custody of the children\u2019s aid society; and\n(d) that in cases under clause b or c the municipality to which the child belongs pay the rate in respect of the child from the day the child was apprehended, or if he was not apprehended, from the day he was brought before the judge as an apparently neglected child, and so long as the child remains in the care and custody of the society.\nThere were amendments to cl. (a) of subs. (8) in 1957 and cl. (d) in 1958, none of which are relevant to the present problem.\nAccordingly, when Fortowsky was decided the Act did not contain s. 25(c) and the Court in Fortowsky was not required to give consideration to the condition \u201cthat the child be made a ward of the Crown until the wardship is terminated under section 31 or 34\u201d, as that stipulation did not exist in law until 1965. It must also be noted that s. 31(1) as it now reads, first appeared in the Act of 1965 as well as s. 84 which reads:\n84. (1) Every children\u2019s aid society shall endeavour to secure the adoption of Crown wards, having regard to the individual needs of each ward.\n(2) Every children\u2019s aid society shall, within one year after a Crown ward is committed to its care, report to the Director in the prescribed form the efforts made to secure the adoption of the ward and the facts relevant to his adoption.\n(3) Every children\u2019s aid society shall submit to the Director a quarterly return in the prescribed form showing, as at the end of each quarter, the adoption status of each Crown ward in its care and of applicants as adoptive parents.\nAt the same time s. 66(3) of the 1960 Act, was replaced by 73(3) which reads:\n73. (3) An order for the adoption of a child who is a Crown ward shall be made only with the written consent of the Director, in which case no other consent is required.\nThis amendment substituted the words \u201cCrown ward\u201d for \u201cwho is committed permanently to the care and custody of a children\u2019s aid society\u201d and substituted \u201cthe Director\u201d for \u201cthe society\u201d.\nThe expression \u201cCrown ward\u201d is not defined in the 1965 Act. However, by s. 32, the Legislature spelled out the Crown\u2019s rights and duties to Crown wards saying, \u201cThe Crown has and shall assume all the rights and responsibilities of a legal guardian over its wards for the purpose of their care, custody and control...\u201d Having so enacted, the question arises\u2014what rights, if any, were left by the Legislature to a Crown ward\u2019s natural parent? The Crown is made the legal guardian and has the care, custody and control of a child designated as a Crown ward. It has the obligation to secure adoption of the child under s. 84(1). By s. 73(3) the natural parent\u2019s consent is dispensed with in the case of a Crown ward in adoption proceedings under Part IV of the Act.\nThe emphasis on the special provisions relating to Crown wards is illustrated by a comparison of the provisions of subss. 1 and 2 of s. 73 with those of subs. 3. Subsections 1 and 2 relate to children committed under s. 25(b) while subs. 3 relates to Crown wards under s. 25(c).\nIt follows from the foregoing that the Legislature intended, by s. 25(c), that once a child was designated as a Crown ward, the natural parent was to be accorded no recourse other than the right to appeal, and the order designating the child as a Crown ward was not to be terminated except as provided in s. 31 or when the child attained the age of 18. The power of the Legislature to so enact cannot be questioned: Reference re Adoption Act, etc.[7]\nI cannot see how the plain words of s. 25(c) \u201cthat the child be made a ward of the Crown until the wardship is terminated under section 31 or 34\u201d can be read as being nullified by the opening words of s. 35(1) because the two subsections have a place in the scheme of things contemplated by the Act. Section 25(c) does not deprive s. 35(1) of effect. Section 35(1) still applies to wards of children\u2019s aid societies who are not Crown wards namely, those so designated under s. 25(b) and to whom s. 31(1) does not apply.\nThe Legislature might have used more specific language, but the language it did use is plain and unambiguous and must be given its plain meaning, and it is obvious from the other changes which were made in the Act in 1965, when s. 25(c) first appeared, that once a child was designated as a Crown ward only a Children\u2019s Aid Society may under s. 31(1), apply for an order terminating the Crown wardship. Once an order under s. 25(b) becomes effective the natural parent has no further enforceable rights. This is the over-all scheme or programme for Crown wards which the Legislature has erected and its power to do so is beyond question: Reference re Adoption Act, etc. It is to be expected that a Children\u2019s Aid Society, having the care of a ward of the Crown, upon being satisfied that it is in the best interests of the child to restore it to the natural parent would accomplish that result by an application under s. 31(1). There are no limitations on a society\u2019s right to do so. The section empowers the judge to terminate the wardship \u201c...if the judge is satisfied that the termination is in the best interests of the child...\u201d\nI would accordingly dismiss the appeal. I agree with my brother Spence that there should be no order as to costs.\nAppeal allowed and case remitted, no order as to costs; JUDSON and HALL JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John P.

Brownscombe (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Public Trustee of the Province of Alberta, Administrator of the Estate of Robert Marcell Vercamert (Defendant) Respondent.\n1969: February 19, 20, 21; 1969: May 16.\nPresent: Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION\nContracts\u2014Part performance\u2014Statute of Frauds\u2014Plaintiff working on farmer\u2019s land without real wages\u2014House built on farm by plaintiff at own expense\u2014Alleged oral agreement that on farmer\u2019s demise farm would go to plaintiff by will\u2014Whether acts of plaintiff \u201cunequivocally referable\u201d to said agreement. Over a period of some twenty-six years the plaintiff worked with but little financial reward for a farmer who because of a heart ailment was unable to carry on his farming operations without assistance. Following the death of the farmer, who died intestate, the plaintiff brought an action against the defendant as administrator of the estate of the deceased for specific performance of an oral agreement by which the plaintiff alleged the deceased had agreed to leave him his farm in return for services rendered, and whereas the said farm had been sold by the administrator, the plaintiff claimed the proceeds thereof. In giving judgment for the plaintiff, the trial judge found that there were acts constituting part performance of the contract so as to afford relief from the operation of the Statute of Frauds. On appeal, the Appellate Division concurred with the finding of the trial judge that there was an oral contract as the plaintiff alleged, but on the question as to whether the acts done by the plaintiff referred \u201cunequivocally\u201d to an agreement that the land was to be left by will the Appellate Division concurred with the finding of the trial judge However, it was held that although there was no part performance and the plaintiff was not entitled to recover the farm he was entitled to be compensated for his services. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed from the judgment of the Appellate Division.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the trial judgment restored.\nNot all the acts relied on by the plaintiff could be regarded as \u201cunequivocally referable in their own nature to some dealing with the land\u201d, but the building of a house on the lands in question at the suggestion of the deceased farmer almost, if not wholly, at the plaintiff\u2019s expense was, as the trial judge found \u201cunequivocally referable\u201d to the agreement which the plaintiff alleged had been made and inconsistent with the ordinary relationship of employee or tenant.\nThe Appellate Division was in error in holding that the act of building the house on the farm in the circumstances of the case was not part performance of the contract.\nMcNeil v. Corbett (1907), 39 S.C.R. 608; Deglman v. Guaranty Trust Co. of Canada and Constantineau, [1954] S.C.R. 725, referred to.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division1, allowing in part an appeal from a judgment of Farthing J. Appeal allowed and trial judgment restored; cross-appeal dismissed.\nW.H. Downton, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nG.R. Forsyth, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an appeal and cross-appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] which allowed in part an appeal by the respondent from a judgment of the late Mr. Justice Farthing in which he had awarded the appellant damages in the sum of $38,000 in lieu of specific performance of an oral agreement between the appellant and the late Robert Marcell Vercamert, the said sum of $38,000 representing the proceeds from the sale of certain lands which the appellant claimed Vercamert had agreed to leave to him for services rendered. The judgment also awarded a certain Chevrolet vehicle to the appellant.\nThe Appellate Division allowed the respondent\u2019s appeal as to that portion of the judgment that there were sufficient unequivocal acts of part performance to grant specific performance or damages in lieu thereof, and substituted a finding that the appellant was entitled to compensation for services rendered to Vercamert in an amount to be fixed by the Appellate Division. The respondent\u2019s appeal as to the Chevrolet vehicle was dismissed. The appellant appeals to this Court to restore the judgment of the learned trial judge as to the $38,000 damages awarded in lieu of specific performance. The respondent gave notice of a cross\u2011appeal to this Court as follows:\nTAKE NOTICE that the Respondent intends to cross-appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from that part of the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta delivered on the 2nd day of May, 1968 wherein the Court confirmed the decision of the Trial Judge that there was an oral agreement between the Appellant and Robert Marcel Vercamert relating to the deceased\u2019s farm lands, that there was performance by the Appellant of such oral agreement, that the evidence of such agreement was corroborated sufficiently to satisfy the provisions of the Alberta Evidence Act and that the Appellant is entitled to compensation for services rendered to the deceased, Robert Marcel Vercamert.\nThe matter of the Chevrolet is not an issue in this appeal.\nThe respondent is the Public Trustee of the Province of Alberta and was sued as Administrator of the Estate of the said Robert Marcell Vercamert who died intestate on January 16, 1961, leaving an estate, including the lands in issue in this litigation, the net value of which was $124,133.54. The lands in issue here were sold by the respondent as Administrator on February 28, 1962, for $38,000.\nThe facts are summarized by the learned trial judge in the opening paragraph of his judgment as follows:\nIn 1932 when Canada and the world in general were in a severe business depression, the plaintiff, whose home was in Prince George, B.C., and who was then sixteen years of age, applied to the late Robert Marcel Vercamert at the latter\u2019s home, not far from Rockyford in Alberta, for work. The said Vercamert, a bachelor, somewhat severely crippled by heart trouble and able to do but little work on the farm where he lived and which he conducted, took the plaintiff into his home. On the evidence I find that plaintiff worked faithfully for his employer with but little financial reward for a considerable number of years. I find that on a number of occasions when plaintiff thought of leaving Vercamert\u2019s employ he was dissuaded by the latter\u2019s promised assurance that on his demise the farm would go to plaintiff by Will. In January, 1961, Vercamert died intestate and this action is the result.\nThe appellant\u2019s evidence of his agreement with Vercamert was corroborated by the evidence of four independent witnesses, Leon Sherger, Joseph Smith MacBeth, Lawrence Stinn and Anthony E. Velker and by the appellant\u2019s wife, to each of whom Vercamert said in effect on separate occasions that the appellant was to get the farm for having worked for Vercamert since a boy and to Sherger he said in particular that he had a will and he was leaving the farm to the appellant.\nAfter reviewing the evidence in detail, Farthing J. made the following finding:\nAfter careful consideration of all of the evidence, I am impelled to find that the plaintiff and Vercamert entered into an oral agreement that the plaintiff would do so such work as Vercamert might reasonably request him to do in carrying on Vercamert\u2019s farm operations until his death, and that in consideration of the plaintiff staying on with him then and carrying out such requests, Vercamert would leave to the plaintiff as payment, the farm he was operating at the time of his death; that the farm at the time of Vercamert\u2019s death consisted of Lots 24 and 25, Parcel C, Plan Grasswald 5755 A.W., and Lots 22 and 35, Parcel C, Plan R.W. 80, aforesaid; and that the reason for the agreement was Vercamert\u2019s inability because of a heart ailment to carry on his farming operations without assistance and he was financially unable to pay any real wages at the time the agreement was made.\nand then he said:\nThe contract relating to land is within s. 4 of the Statute of Frauds, and there is no memorandum in writing. Therefore, part performance is necessary for the plaintiff to succeed on his claim for specific performance. Per Cranworth, L.C. in Caton v. Caton (1866), 1 Ch. App. 137, at p. 147: Part performance will afford relief from the operation of the Statute \u2018\u2026in many cases\u2026 when to insist upon it would be to make it the means of effecting instead of preventing fraud.\u2019 However, not all acts done in pursuance of the unenforceable contract will constitute part performance in law. They may be found to relate only to a contract of service as in Maddison v. Alderson (1883), 8 App. Cas. 467, and Deglman v. Guaranty Trust Co. of Canada and Constantineau, [1954] S.C.R. 725, except where such acts are \u2018unequivocally referable in their own nature to some dealing with the land which is alleged to have been the subject of the agreement sued upon\u2026\u2019: Per Duff, J. in McNeil v. Corbett (1907), 39 S.C.R. 608, approved by the Supreme Court of Canada in Deglman, supra.\nHe then canvassed the evidence to determine if the acts testified to in the evidence in pursuance of the verbal contract were \u201cunequivocally referable in their own nature to some dealing with the land\u201d and found:\nIn this case, there is no doubt in my mind that the work the plaintiff did on the farm and the services he performed for Vercamert, as well as suiting his working and living arrangements to Vercamert\u2019s needs and requests over a period of some twenty-six years, were \u2018unequivocally referable\u2019 to the agreement that existed between them. The plaintiff fully performed his part of the agreement, and he did so for a wholly inadequate compensation in money. Vercamert\u2019s books, which were introduced in evidence, showed a total of less than $2,200.00 paid to Vercamert [sic] over the whole period in question, and there were other exhibits filed indicating that part of that sum was paid to the plaintiff for goods purchased for Vercamert. However, as I have stated already, this evidence can only go to satisfy me that the agreement between these parties as alleged by the plaintiff, existed.\nand concluded:\nI therefore find that the plaintiff was entitled to specific performance of the oral agreement which has been so partly performed. Therefore, the plaintiff was the equitable owner of the farm lands and buildings, and as the equitable owner he is entitled to the proceeds of their sale.\nI also find that the plaintiff is entitled to a declaration of title to the 1950 Chevrolet truck, Serial #1131403564, for the reason that it having been registered in his name in 1957 and he having performed acts of ownership in relation to it in that year and the following, by providing the license plates, and no further registration having been effected, is prima facie the owner, and I do not find that the evidence adduced by the defendant satisfied the onus which was on the defendant of proving otherwise.\nIn the Appellate Division, McDermid J.A., writing for the Court, concurred in the finding of the learned trial judge that there was an oral contract as the plaintiff alleged. In this regard he said:\nThe learned trial judge came to the conclusion that there was an express contract and, as there was evidence on which the learned trial judge could so find, I think we should not interfere with that finding. In Maddison v. Alderson [supra], where a housekeeper performed services for the deceased over a long period of time on the basis that he was to leave her certain property the Law Lords expressed doubts as to the existence of a contract. Lord Selborne L.C. at p. 472 said: \u2018If there was a contract on his part, it was conditional upon, and in consideration of, a series of acts to be done by her, which she was at liberty to do, or not to do, as she thought fit; and which if done, would extend over the whole remainder of his life. If he had dismissed her, I do not see how she could have brought any action at law, or obtained any relief in equity.\u2019 Such a contract made during the lifetime of the parties may well be a unilateral contract as distinguished from a bilateral or synallagmatic contract as those terms are used by Diplock, L.J. in United Dominions Trust (Commercial) Ltd. v. Eagle Aircraft Services Ltd., [1968] 1 All E.R. 104. However, whether the arrangement constitutes a binding contract during the lifetime of the parties, if the services are performed, then upon the death of the person receiving the same there is a valid contract. Such validity was clearly recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada in Deglman v. Guaranty Trust Company of Canada and Constantineau [supra].\nAs to the argument that the contract was too vague, in Williston on Contracts, 3rd ed., vol. 1, pp. 158-9, it is stated: \u2018If, however, the side of the agreement which was originally too vague for enforcement becomes definite by entire or partial performance, the other side of the agreement (or a divisible part thereof, corresponding to the performance received), though originally unenforceable, becomes binding.\u2019\nCounsel for the appellant further argued that if there was an agreement the respondent had not fulfilled his side of the agreement. I think there was substantial performance of the agreement by the respondent. If there was any lack of performance on the part of the respondent, such performance was prevented by the conduct of the deceased.\nHowever, on the question as to whether the acts done by the appellant referred \u201cunequivocally\u201d to an agreement that the land was to be left by will to the appellant, McDermid J.A. held:\nThe learned trial judge considered the acts of labour done over the life of the agreement and the respondent\u2019s act of building the house were acts of part performance. With the greatest of respect I do not agree.\nHere the acts of labour done over the whole life of the agreement are not \u2018unequivocally and in their own nature referable\u2019 to an agreement that the land on which the acts were performed was to be left by will to the person who did the labour. Ordinarily it would be expected that such acts of labour were referable to a contract of employment to pay wages. They are certainly not unequivocal acts. See also Turner v. Prevost (1890), 17 S.C.R. 283. Nor do I think the act of building the house on the farm was part performance. As stated in Fry on Specific Performance, 6th ed., at p. 284: \u2018For acts to amount to part performance, the contract \u201cmust be obligatory, and what is done must be done under the terms of the agreement and by force of the agreement.\u201d\u2019 The respondent was in possession of the farm under a lease and as a tenant. I do not see how in the circumstances the building of the house could have been considered to have been done under the terms of a contract that the respondent was to work for the deceased and be left the farm.\nBut having so found, McDermid J.A. continued:\nHowever, although there was no part performance and the respondent is not entitled to recover the farm he is entitled to be compensated for his services.\n* * *\nThere was evidence corroborating the claim of the respondent as required by the provisions of The Alberta Evidence Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 102, s. 13. Four witnesses were called by the respondent who all stated that over the course of years the deceased had said that on his death the respondent would get the farm. Ordinarily this case should be referred back to the trial judge to determine the amount owing to the respondent. However, as the trial judge has since retired the amount will be determined by this Division and counsel will be given the opportunity of making representations as to what this amount should be.\nThe issue for decision by this Court is whether the acts relied upon by the appellant over the period 1932 to 1961 are acts which are \u201cunequivocally referable in their own nature to some dealing with the land which is alleged to have been the subject of the agreement sued on\u201d as stated by Duff J. (as he then was) in McNeil v. Corbett, supra, and approved by this Court in Deglman v. Guaranty Trust Co. of Canada and Constantineau, supra.\nIt is clear that not all the acts relied on as testified to by the appellant and his wife can be regarded as \u201cunequivocally referable in their own nature to some dealing with the land\u201d, but in my view the building of the house on the lands in question in the years 1946 and 1947 at the suggestion of Vercamert almost, if not wholly, at the appellant\u2019s expense was, as the learned trial judge found \u201cunequivocally referable\u201d to the agreement which the appellant alleged had been made and inconsistent with the ordinary relationship of employee or tenant.\nWith respect, I think that McDermid J.A. was in error in holding that the act of building the house on the farm in the circumstances detailed in the evidence and accepted by the learned trial judge was not part performance of the contract which both the learned trial judge and the Appellate Division found existed between the appellant and Vercamert.\nI would, accordingly, allow the appeal and restore the judgment of Farthing J. with costs here and in the Appellate Division. The appellant is entitled to receive the $38,000 together with interest on the said sum which has accrued to the respondent since the receipt of the said moneys and the respondent shall account to the appellant for the same. The cross-appeal will stand dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed and trial judgment restored, with costs; cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Collier, Downton, Plotkins & Mackie, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Howard, Moore, Dixon, Mackie & Forsyth, Calgary.\n[1] (1968), 64 W.W.R. 559, 69 D.L.R.

The respondent has left the country, was not represented in the Court of Appeal and his solicitors will not represent him on the appeal. The bondsmen applied to a Judge in Chambers for leave to intervene under Rule 60 of the Rules of this Court.

Gibb Stewart, Q.C., for the appellant.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nPIGEON J.:\u2014In this case Norcan Ltd. appeals from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Province of Quebec affirming a judgment of the Superior Court granting Harold Lebrock\u2019s petition to quash a writ of capias and discharging the bondsmen. It appears from the reasons for judgment that Lebrock has left the country and was not represented at the hearing. The solicitors who had been acting for him have notified the Registrar that their mandate has been revoked and that they will not represent him in this Court. Under those circumstances, the bondsmen ask for leave to intervene under rule 60.\nCounsel for Norcan Ltd., the appellant, opposes the application relying on decisions under the provisions of the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure respecting intervention. These decisions are to the effect that the interest required to file an intervention must be an interest in the subject-matter of the litigation, not merely an interest in the result. As a consequence, the right of intervention has been denied to bondsmen, the latest case being Druckman v. Stand Built Upholstery Corporation[1] affirmed in this Court[2]. Seeing that the provisions of the old Quebec Code of Civil Procedure concerning intervention were practically identical with rule 60 and seem to have inspired it (Cameron, Supreme Court Practice, 3rd ed., p. 430), the objection appeared serious and I referred the matter to the Court.\nHaving now made a review of past decisions under rule 60, I have come to the conclusion that it should not be narrowly construed. It seems clear that any interest is sufficient to support an application under that rule subject always to the exercise of discretion. In Massie & Renwick v. Underwriters\u2019 Survey Bureau (unreported; reported on merits[3]), leave to intervene in an: action for infringement of copyright was granted to persons against whom similar actions were pending. They were held to be \u201cvitally interested and concerned with the questions involved in these appeals\u201d.\nIn Winner v. S.M.T. (unreported; reported on merits[4], varied by P.C.[5]), railway companies were granted leave to intervene in a case respecting the constitutional validity and application of provincial regulations of motor carriers in interprovincial or international operations.\nI should also note that our rule is quite different from that which was held to have a narrow scope in Moser v. Marsden[6].\nFinally, I should observe that in Druckman v. Stand Built Upholstery, the application was made only after judgment had been rendered dismissing the appeal. It is well settled that an application for permission to intervene may be made only as long as the case is pending. For that reason, all that was said in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench as to the required interest is undoubtedly obiter.\nOn the merits of the application no reason was given for opposing it, except the contention that the bondsmen should not be considered as having the required interest.\nUnder the circumstances of this case it seems proper to make the order requested. The costs will be reserved for adjudication at the same time as the merits of the appeal.\nApplication granted.\nSolicitor for the applicants: J.M.

The latter, after having worked a 12-hour daytime shift at the bottom of a 600-foot shaft, was persuaded by E, with reluctance, to drive him to a dance, at a place some 30 miles from the mine. The party lasted until 2 o\u2019clock the next morning, and, thereafter, E insisted on being driven to the home of a friend, where he remained until about 4 a.m. During the greater part of the evening and particularly during the last two hours, the defendant repeatedly suggested that they should go home and more than once pointed out he was tired. E was drinking throughout the evening but the defendant only had one drink which he consumed shortly after arriving. When E finally consented to leave, he got into the passenger seat of the car and \u201cjust said a few words and then fell asleep\u201d.\nAfter he had been driving towards home for a little while, the defendant got out of the car to relieve himself and left the front window down and the air conditioning turned on. Later, he wanted to stop again for a rest but he dozed off before the vehicle was brought to a stop. The car left the road, went into a ditch and struck a culvert, and as a result of the accident E suffered injuries which caused his death.\nIn an action brought by the plaintiff under the Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.N.B 1952, c. 82, as administratrix of the deceased, the trial judge found that the defendant\u2019s action in going to sleep at the wheel of his car and thus causing it to leave the road amounted to gross negligence. The trial judge found also that the circumstances under which E embarked on the drive were such as to give rise to the inference that he had voluntarily accepted the risk of the defendant going to sleep and that the rule embodied in the maxim volenti non fit injuria applied so as to preclude the plaintiff from bringing the action. On appeal, the Court of Appeal affirmed the dismissal of the action. An appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld (Martland J. dissenting in part): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Ritchie, Hall and Pigeon JJ.: Neither when the defendant and E left the mine nor when E finally entered the car at 4 a.m., befuddled by alcohol, was the situation such as necessarily to lead to the conclusion that he had taken upon himself the whole risk of being injured as a result of the grossly negligent driving of the defendant, nor was the evidence such as to justify the conclusion that the defendant accepted him into his automobile on any such footing.\nE did not actively contribute to the accident by any negligent act on his part; he was merely a passive victim and not responsible for the way the car was driven. He was incautious in embarking on the return journey with the defendant in the sense that it was 4 a.m. and he knew that his driver had been working for 12 hours on the day before, but no degree of fault could be attributed to E because the conscious act of the defendant in continuing to drive when he knew that he was sleepy was not conduct which could have been reasonably foreseen by his passenger.\nPer Martland J., dissenting in part: The appeal should succeed only as to a portion of the damages involved. In the light of Lehnert v. Stein, infra, the defendant could not rely, successfully, upon the defence of volenti non fit injuria. However, there was contributory negligence on the part of E and he was responsible, in part, for the accident. By his own conduct, E had contributed to the physical condition of the defendant which led to the accident.\n[Yarmouth v. France (1887), 19 Q.B.D. 647; Lehnert v.

Picard, [1964] B.R. 348, affirmed [1965] S.C.R. vi, referred to.]\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division1, affirming a judgment of Dickson J. Appeal allowed, Martland J. dissenting in part.\nP.A.A. Ryan, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nD.M. Gillis, Q.C., and J.T. Jones, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Ritchie, Hall and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick[1] affirming the dismissal of an action brought by the appellant under the Fatal Accidents Act as administratrix of the late Ole Eid for funeral expenses and on behalf of the estate of his widow and his minor and dependent son for compensation for the pecuniary loss suffered by them as a result of his death while he was being driven by the respondent in the respondent\u2019s motor vehicle.\nThe judgment appealed from dismissed an appeal from the judgment rendered at trial by Dickson J., whereby he found that the respondent\u2019s action in going to sleep at the wheel of his car and thus causing it to leave the road in the manner hereinafter described while driving the late Mr. Eid home from a dance at 4 a.m. on July 9, 1966, amounted to gross negligence. The learned trial judge found also that the circumstances under which Eid embarked on the drive were such as to give rise to the inference that he had voluntarily accepted the risk of the respondent going to sleep and that the rule embodied in the maxim volenti non fit injuria applied so as to preclude the appellant from bringing this action.\nThe circumstances surrounding and immediately preceding the accident which resulted in Mr. Eid\u2019s death, when the car left the road, have been fully described both by the trial judge and by the Chief Justice of New Brunswick who rendered the judgment on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal, but as I take a somewhat different view of their legal effect than that which was entertained by the Courts below, it will be necessary to review them briefly.\nMr. Eid was a man of 56 years of age and the respondent, who was only 29, was a shaftsman employed by a mining development company where he was a member of a crew working under the supervision of Mr. Eid on a 12-hour daytime shift at the bottom of a 600-foot shaft. On several occasions during the first week in July, 1966, Eid had approached the respondent asking him to drive him over to a dance at a Legion Hall about 30 miles from the mine on the night of Friday July 8 and the respondent finally, although reluctantly, consented to do this with the result that, after having put in a full day\u2019s work, he found himself attending a party which lasted until 2 o\u2019clock in the morning, after which the older man insisted on being driven to the home of a friend where he had more to drink and from which he would not agree to go home until about 4 a.m. It should be stressed that during the greater part of the evening and particularly during the last two hours, the respondent repeatedly suggested that they should go home and more than once pointed out that he was tired. Mr. Eid was drinking throughout the evening while the learned trial judge found that the respondent only had one drink which he consumed shortly after arriving. When Mr. Eid finally consented to leave, he got into the passenger seat of the car and \u201cjust said a few words and then fell asleep\u201d.\nAfter he had been driving towards home for a little while, the respondent got out of the car to relieve himself and left the front window down and the air conditioning turned on. I am persuaded that the respondent had a forewarning of sleep because he made a statement to the police which was admitted in evidence in which he said:\nI wanted to go home but Ole wanted to stay. Finally we left this house and headed back towards the Mine, the same road we came on. Ole was asleep on the right side of the front seat. I got sleepy and wanted to stop for a rest, but I dozed off before I got stopped and I woke when the car hit the culvert. I was travelling maybe 30 or 40 M.P.H. I had been drinking maybe one or two glasses of rum but not enough to affect my driving.\nIn giving evidence at the trial, the respondent stated that he had at no time felt tired or experienced any premonition of being tired, and although at one point the learned trial judge appears to have accepted this statement, he later reconsidered this finding and said:\nEven though he disclaims awareness of premonitory signals of fatigue, it is inconceivable to me that they were not present and there for him to regard plainly if he so chose.\nWhen the respondent dozed off the car was proceeding along a straight piece of paved highway 20 feet wide with a 3-foot gravelled shoulder on either side and it went off the pavement onto the right shoulder, tipped over sideways as its right wheels entered an appreciable ditch beside the road, knocked down a mailbox post located near the edge of the shoulder, snapped off a guy wire supporting a telephone pole near a culvert, and brought up with sudden force against the culvert which extended across the ditch. The wheels of the car left no mark on the pavement but the left wheels left an impression on the shoulder and in the ditch which extended 142 feet from where they entered on the shoulder. The tracks of the wheels did not suggest that the brakes had been applied. In the Province of New Brunswick, by virtue of s. 242(1) of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1955, c. 13, no gratuitous passenger has a cause of action for damages against the owner or driver of a motor vehicle\n\u2026for injury, death or loss, in case of accident, unless the accident was caused by the gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct of the owner or driver of the motor vehicle and unless the gross negligence or wilful and wanton misconduct contributed to the injury, death or loss, for which the action is brought.\nHaving regard to the way in which the motor vehicle was operated immediately before and at the time of the accident, and to the fact that the respondent fell asleep as he did while driving, I agree with the finding of the learned trial judge that his conduct amounted to gross negligence, and that he is therefore deprived of the defence which would otherwise have been available to him under the last-quoted section of the Motor Vehicle Act\nIn the present case the defence of volenti non fit injuria is pleaded in the following form:\nIn the alternative, the Defendant says that if the Defendant was negligent as alleged (which is not admitted but expressly denied), that the said deceased OLE EID voluntarily assumed the risk of injury from such negligence by requesting the Defendant to wait for him until a late hour and the Defendant pleads and relies on volenti non fit injuria.\nWith respect to this defence, it was said many years ago by Lindley L.J., in the case of Yarmouth v. France[2], that:\nThe question in each case must be, not simply whether the plaintiff knew of the risk, but whether the circumstances are such as necessarily to lead to the conclusion that the whole risk was voluntarily incurred by the plaintiff.\nAs pointed out by Bridges C.J.N.B., the rule embodied in the maxim volenti non fit injuria was discussed by the present Chief Justice speaking on behalf of the majority of this Court in Lehnert v. Stein[3], where he said, in reference to the case of Car and General Insurance Corporation Ltd. v. Seymour and Moloney[4]:\nThat decision establishes that where a driver of a motor vehicle invokes the maxim volenti non fit injuria as a defence to an action for damages for injuries caused by his negligence to a passenger, the burden lies upon the defendant of proving that the plaintiff, expressly or by necessary implication, agreed to exempt the defendant from liability for any damage suffered by the plaintiff occasioned by that negligence, and that, as stated in Salmond on Torts, 13th ed., p. 44:\nThe true question in every case is: Did the plaintiff give a real consent to the assumption of the risk without compensation; did the consent really absolve the defendant from the duty to take care?\nI think it proper to point out also that in the same case the majority of the Court adopted the following passages from Mr. Glanville Williams\u2019 work Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence (1951), at p. 308:\nIt is submitted that the key to an understanding of the true scope of the volens maxim lies in drawing a distinction between what may be called physical and legal risk. Physical risk is the risk of damage in fact; legal risk is the risk of damage in fact for which there will be no redress in law.\n* * *\nTo put this in general terms, the defence of volens does not apply where as a result of a mental process the plaintiff decides to take a chance but there is nothing in his conduct to show a waiver of the right of action communicated to the other party. To constitute a defence, there must have been an express or implied bargain between the parties whereby the plaintiff gave up his right of action for negligence.\nAs has been indicated, the project of driving to the Legion dance was born in the mind of Mr. Eid and the respondent was persuaded against his will to make himself and his car available for the trip, but with the greatest respect for the opinion of the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal, I do not think it can be said that, either when they left the mine or when Mr. Eid finally entered the car at 4 a.m., befuddled by alcohol, the situation was such as necessarily to lead to the conclusion that he had taken upon himself the whole risk of being injured as a result of the grossly negligent driving of the respondent, nor do I think that the evidence is such as to justify the conclusion that the respondent accepted him into his automobile on any such footing. Although the respondent had complained of being tired during the evening, he stated in cross-examination that the true situation was that he was \u201cfed up\u201d with the party and that his complaints were \u201conly an excuse so we could go\u201d. His own assessment of his condition before leaving at 4 a.m. was: \u201cI was outside for quite a while and I was feeling all right.\u201d I take it from this evidence that when he started on the journey home the respondent had no reason to expect that there was any risk of his going to sleep at the wheel and I do not think that any such expectation can be attributed to his passenger.\nAlthough the learned trial judge found that Mr. Eid must be considered to have been volens, he went on to consider the question of contributory negligence in case his first finding should be \u201cthe subject of consideration in subsequent proceedings\u201d. The learned trial judge\u2019s finding in this regard is as follows:\n\u2026I am of the opinion that the accident and the resultant death were caused in substantial measure by the deceased delaying, when he should have appreciated the possible consequences, the defendant in returning home. The deceased was particularly aware of the hours the defendant had worked, not only that day but through the whole week. He also knew that the defendant\u2019s duties in his work were most onerous, carried out as they were at the bottom of a 600-foot mine shaft with a heavy apparatus hauling excavated material to the surface over his head. Further, once in the car, instead of assisting the defendant in getting them safely back to camp by engaging in conversation or otherwise assisting in keeping him awake, the deceased immediately went to sleep and left the defendant on his own. The deceased must therefore be considered guilty of contributory negligence and I would apportion the fault two-thirds against the deceased and one-third against the defendant.\nI do not think that any duty rested upon Mr. Eid to engage the respondent in conversation while they were driving and although he was aware of the hard work done by the respondent from day to day, I am, with the greatest respect, unable to agree that the delays for which Eid was responsible can be classified as negligence which contributed to the accident.\nIn my view Eid cannot be said to have actively contributed to the accident by any negligent act of his; he was merely a passive victim and not responsible for the way the car was driven, but the doctrine of contributory negligence is not confined to cases in which the plaintiff actively participates in the result; it is equally applicable where a plaintiff fails to take reasonable steps to protect himself from the consequences of the defendant\u2019s negligence. This appears to me to have been recognized in this Court in Car and General Insurance Corporation Ltd. v. Seymour and Moloney, supra, at p. 332, and also in the well-known judgment of Viscount Simon in Nance v. British Columbia Electric Railway Co. Ltd.[5] I think, therefore, that the question to be determined in this case is whether, when Mr. Eid allowed himself to be driven home by the respondent at 4 a.m., he showed such a disregard for his own safety as to relieve the respondent from a proportion of the responsibility for the tragic consequences which ensued.\nIt might perhaps be said that Eid was imprudent to expose himself to the possibility of his driver being tired and dropping off to sleep, but although the hour was late, the respondent was sober and the contemplated drive was a short one of 30 miles. Under all the circumstances, I do not think that there was any reason for Eid to foresee that Dumas would continue to drive after he knew that he was sleepy and when he \u201cwanted to stop for a rest\u201d. I do not think that gross negligence of this kind can be said to be a reasonably foreseeable risk against which the passenger is required to protect himself at the risk of being found to have been guilty of contributory negligence.\nI am fortified in this opinion by the case of Guay v. Picard[6], which was affirmed without reasons in this Court[7], in which the driver, who was 28 years of age, started out from Quebec at 3 a.m. with two others, drove to St. Simeon arriving at 6:30, and spent the entire day fishing, commencing the return journey at 8:30 in the evening. On the drive home he fell asleep and lost control of the car which went off the road, injuring the plaintiff. The defence of volenti non fit injuria and contributory negligence were both raised and after somewhat unsatisfactory answers had been given by the jury, the passenger plaintiff was awarded 55 per cent of the amount found by the jury. This award was set aside in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for the Province of Quebec where it was found there was no contributory negligence.\nAs I have indicated, I take the view that the act of Eid in embarking on the return journey with the respondent was an incautious one in the sense that it was 4 o\u2019clock in the morning and he knew that his driver had been working for 12 hours on the day before, but I do not think that any degree of fault can be attributed to Eid because the conscious act of the respondent in continuing to drive when he knew that he was sleepy was not conduct which could have been reasonably foreseen by his passenger.\nI would accordingly allow this appeal, set aside the judgments of the Courts below and give judgment for the appellant in her capacity as administratrix of the late Mr. Eid and on behalf of the estate of his widow and of his minor and dependent son in the amount of the damages assessed by the learned trial judge.\nThe appellant will have her costs in this Court and in the Courts below.\nMARTLAND J. (dissenting in part):\u2014The facts of this case have been outlined in the reasons of my brother Ritchie. I am in agreement with him that, in the light of the decision of this Court in Lehnert v. Stein[8], the respondent cannot rely, successfully, upon the defence of volenti non fit injuria. With respect, however, I am unable to concur in the conclusion that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the deceased, Ole Eid.\nThe learned trial judge has found that the gross negligence of the respondent was \u201cin dozing off and driving off the road.\u201d The reason why this occurred is clear. The respondent, after working a 12-hour, daytime shift at the bottom of a 600-foot shaft, with reluctance, had been persuaded by Eid, who was his supervisor at the mine, to drive him to a dance, at a place some 30 miles from the mine. The party lasted until 2 o\u2019clock the next morning, and, thereafter, Eid insisted on being driven to the home of a friend, where he remained until about 4 a.m. The drive to return to the mine did not commence until then.\nIn my opinion, the drowsy condition of the respondent, which ultimately resulted in the accident, was caused, at least in part, by Eid himself, as a result of his demands upon the respondent. This is not a case in which the defendant seeks to impose part of the responsibility for an accident on the basis that, although himself negligent, the plaintiff failed to exercise reasonable care for his own safety. This is a case in which the plaintiff himself was a participant in actually causing the accident, and, if that is so, such conduct is clearly contributory negligence. I do not see how it would lie in the mouth of Eid, having helped to create the drowsy condition of the respondent, to say that, when that condition resulted in the respondent\u2019s dozing off and driving off the road, the responsibility for the accident rested solely with the respondent. With respect, I do not agree that the question to be determined in this case is whether, when Eid allowed himself to be driven by the respondent at 4 a.m., he showed such a disregard for his own safety as to relieve the respondent from a proportion of the responsibility for the accident. The question is rather whether Eid, by his own conduct, contributed to the physical condition of the respondent which led to the accident. This is not the simple case of a passenger accepting a lift from someone who, he knows, is short of sleep. It is a case in which a passenger, having caused that condition, seeks to recover 100 per cent of the damage which ultimately results from it.\nNor am I in agreement with the conclusion that there was a conscious act on the part of the respondent in driving when he knew that he was drowsy. The evidence on this point is only that:\nI got sleepy and wanted to stop for a rest, but I dozed off before I got stopped.\nThe respondent had become too drowsy to be able to make the conscious effort of will necessary to bring his car to a stop.\nIn my opinion, therefore, there was contributory negligence on the part of Eid and he was responsible, in part, for the accident. Because of the views of the other members of the Court as to liability, there is no point in my expressing any opinion as to what would be the appropriate division of responsibility.\nIn my opinion the appeal should succeed only as to a portion of the damages involved.\nAppeal allowed with costs, MARTLAND J. dissenting in part.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Ryan & Graser, Fredericton.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Gilbert, McGloan & Gillis, Saint John.\n[1] (1968), 68 D.L.R.

A special committee was appointed by the president of the university to consider an appeal by the appellant from the decision of the law school, and, after holding a number of hearings, the committee rendered its report which concluded with the recommendation that due to special circumstances and for compassionate reasons the appellant be granted his degree in law. This report was, considered by an executive committee of the faculty council, and the executive committee, refusing to accept the recommendation of the special committee, recommended to the faculty council that the appellant be not granted the degree. The reports of the special committee and of the executive were presented to the council and the council agreed with the recommendation of the executive that the degree not be granted. The appellant then appealed to the chancellor. The latter considered the appeal to be one to the senate of the university and, in accordance with the provisions of statute XII of the statutes of the senate, he appointed a committee consisting of himself, the president of the university and three deans. Unlike the earlier hearings and meetings of the various university bodies, where the appellant was neither present nor represented by counsel, at the hearing of the senate committee the appellant was present in person and represented by counsel. The committee refused to allow the appeal.\nAn application for mandamus requiring the university through its faculty council, pursuant to s, 76(c) of The University Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 167, to hear and determine the appeal of the applicant was dismissed on the ground that the granting of degrees was essentially a domestic matter and that therefore the jurisdiction of the visitor, as provided by s. 12(3) of The Queen\u2019s Bench Act, R.S.S. 1965, c. 73, excluded that of the ordinary Courts. An appeal from the judgment of the chambers judge to the Court of Appeal was dismissed. The Court of Appeal held that the respective duties of the faculty council and of the senate created by s. 76(c) were not domestic but public, and specially affected the rights of the appellant. There had been, how- ever, no failure by the council or the senate to perform their respective duties and for that reason the appellant had no right to a mandamus. The appellant was really taking the position that the proceedings were conducted in a manner which amounted to a denial of natural justice. Even if this were true, mandamus was not the appropriate remedy. An appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nOn the question as to whether a denial of natural justice had occurred, an examination of the facts showed that there was no lack of natural justice before the senate appeal committee and that the proceedings in fact were carried out with the full knowledge and approval of the appellant and his counsel. Any possible failure of natural justice before the special appeal committee, the executive committee or the full faculty council, was quite unimportant when the senate, the appeal body under the provisions of The University Act, and also the body in control of the granting of degrees, had exercised its function with no failure to accord natural justice. If there were an absence of natural justice in the inferior tribunals, it was cured by the presence of such natural justice before the senate appeal committee.\nAs to the submission that in each case when the appellant\u2019s appeals were being considered by the successive tribunals, there was a duplication of membership in the body with the earlier tribunal, the Court was not ready to agree that such duplication would result in any bias or constitute a breach of natural justice. In such matters as were the concern of the various university bodies here, duplication was proper and was to be expected. It was significant that no member of any of the bodies was a member of the law faculty, and that when the dean or members of that faculty attended any of the bodies they withdrew before voting.\nPosluns v.

Ontario Labour Relations Board, Ex p. Hall, [1963] 2 O.R. 239, distinguished.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Johnson J. Appeal dismissed.\nK.C. Binks, Q.C., and W. Simpson, for the appellant.\nD.E. Gauley, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[2], made on December 5, 1968, wherein that Court dismissed an appeal from the judgment of Johnson J. of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench made on October 11, 1968. By the latter judgment, Johnson J. refused the application of the appellant for a mandamus requiring the University of Saskatchewan, through its delegated authority the faculty council, to properly hear and determine the appeal of the appellant.\nThe appellant had, after several attempts, failed to obtain the standing required by the Law School of the University of Saskatchewan which would have entitled him to the degree of bachelor of laws. After rather lengthy negotiations and discussions with the authorities of the university, the appellant on August 8, 1964, by letter addressed to the president of the university, appealed from the decision of the law school and requested that he be given opportunity to be present at any hearing of such appeal and the opportunity to be represented by counsel.\nThe president of the university appointed a special committee of the faculty council of the university to consider this appeal and by his letter dated August 14, 1964, suggested that the appellant should provide a detailed brief in support of his appeal of August 8. The appellant did so. The said special committee held four hearings, to which reference shall be made hereafter, and rendered its report which concluded with the recommendation that due to special circumstances and for compassionate reasons the appellant be granted his degree in law. This report was considered by an executive committee of the faculty council on December 15, 1964, and the executive committee, refusing to accept the recommendation of the special committee, recommended to the faculty council that the appellant be not granted the degree. The faculty council considered the matter at a meeting which evidently occurred on February 18, 1965. Although the material does not include the minutes of that meeting of the university council, there is in the material a notice calling the meeting for February 16; evidently, the meeting was postponed for two days. Included with that notice is an agenda outlining a very large number of matters amongst them the report of the special faculty committee of the council (sometimes known as the special appeal committee) and reciting:\nAt a special meeting of the Executive held in December the recommendation of the Special Committee of the Executive was considered in considerable detail and the appeal was rejected by the Executive by a large majority. In the minutes of a meeting of the faculty council (entitled Saskatoon Council) of June 14, 1967, called to consider the matter, their disposition of the reports of the special appeal committee and of the executive committee made at its meeting on February 18, 1965, is outlined in these words:\nThis report [that of the Special Appeal Committee] and the decision of the Executive was presented to the Council and the Council agreed with the recommendation of the Executive that the degree not be granted. (There were no votes in Council against this motion.)\nEvidently as a result of a suggestion that he could take such action, the appellant thereafter appealed to the chancellor of the University of Saskatchewan, Chief Justice E.M. Culliton. The chancellor considered that appeal to be one to the senate of the university and took cognizance of statute XII of the statutes of the senate which reads as follows:\nAll appeals to the Senate under the provisions of Section 76 subsection (c) of the University Act shall be heard and decided by a committee consisting of the Chancellor the Vice-Chancellor and three other members of the Senate appointed by the Chancellor for that purpose.\nThe chancellor appointed the committee in accordance with the provisions of that statute of the senate. It consisted of himself, the president of the university who was the vice-chancellor thereof, and three deans. At the hearing of this senate committee so composed, the appellant was present in person and represented by counsel. Further reference shall be made hereafter to this circumstance.\nThe committee met on November 3, 1965, and on the same day determined to disallow the appeal. The chancellor has sworn that on the next day he notified the appellant\u2019s counsel of such decision and thereafter upon the instructions of the committee he prepared and submitted to the senate of the university a formal report. This report concludes with this statement:\nAfter reviewing the submissions the committee unanimously concluded there was no evidence whatever to substantiate King\u2019s allegations of any breach of terms of his registration or that there was any breach of ethics by the faculty of the College of Law. The committee further unanimously decided:\n(a) That there was no basis within the University regulations under which a degree in law could be granted to King;\n(b) That there were no grounds upon which the ruling of the faculty, as confirmed by the special committee and by council, could be disturbed. The appellant served upon the university two demands, dated April 14 and 25, 1967, and the university having failed to comply with those demands he commenced these proceedings for mandamus.\nThe respondent urged before Johnson J. upon the hearing of the appellant\u2019s application five preliminary objections. In this Court, the respondent pursued only the first of these objections. That objection is outlined in the material in an addendum to the reasons of Johnson J., and it was that the Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the application. It was submitted that the conferring of a degree is a domestic matter coming within the exclusive jurisdiction of the visitor and consequently the Court had no jurisdiction to entertain this application.\nThe University Act has, since the year 1907, made provision for a visitor. The provisions perhaps may best be cited from The University Act, 1968 (Sask.), c. 80, s. 9 of which reads:\nThe Lieutenant Governor shall be the visitor of the university with authority to do all those acts that pertain to visitors as to him seem meet.\nSection 12(3) of The Queen\u2019s Bench Act, R.S.S. 1965, c. 73, provides:\nIn respect of the jurisdiction and powers of the Lieutenant Governor as visitor of corporations, conferred by statute or otherwise, the court shall, upon the direction of the Lieutenant Governor, have and exercise the jurisdiction and powers that in England, prior to the passing of The Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, were vested in, or capable of being exercised by, the Lord Chancellor representing the Crown as visitor of corporations.\nJohnson J. gave effect to this preliminary objection being of the opinion that the granting of degrees was essentially a domestic matter and that therefore the statutory jurisdiction of the visitor excluded that of the ordinary Courts. Johnson J. pointed out that although by the aforesaid s. 12(3) that jurisdiction was to be exercised by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Saskatchewan, it was only to be so exercised upon direction of the Lieutenant Governor as visitor and determined that lacking such direction he had no power to act.\nWhen the matter was considered by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, that Court dealt with the same preliminary objection and, with respect, I am of the opinion that it came to the proper conclusion in reference thereto. Hall J.A., giving the reasons for the Court, pointed out the provisions of s. 76(c) of The University Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 167:\n76. It shall be the duty of the council and it shall have power:\n* * *\n(c) to deal with and, subject to an appeal to the senate, to decide upon all applications and memorials by students or others in connection with any faculty of the university;\nand noted that although the ultimate aim of the appellant was to obtain a degree in law, the immediate purpose of his application was to compel compliance with this s. 76(c) of The University Act. The actual words in the application for mandamus were:\nrequiring the said University of Saskatchewan pursuant to s. 76(c), R.S.S. 1953, c. 167, through its delegated authority, the said faculty council, to properly hear and determine the appeal of the said applicant according to law.\nIt was the learned justice in appeal\u2019s opinion that the section created a statutory duty to be performed by the faculty council subject to appeal to the senate and that compliance with the statutory duty may be controlled and enforced by the ordinary Courts and therefore such decisions as R. v. Dunsheath, Ex p. Meredith[3], and Thorne v. University of London[4], do not apply to exclude the jurisdiction of the Courts. Hall J.A. concluded:\nThe respective duties [of the faculty council and of the senate] so created are therefore not domestic matters within the university but are in the nature of public duties, and as they specially affect the rights of the appellant, mandamus may be granted if there has been a failure to perform them.\nWith respect, I agree with that conclusion and I reject this preliminary objection.\nHall J.A. continued in his reasons:\nIt is quite apparent, however, that in the instant case the university council has dealt with and decided upon the application of the appellant and also that the senate has heard and determined the subsequent appeal. The material filed by the appellant in support of his motion establishes this beyond doubt. There has been, therefore, no failure by the university council or the senate to perform their respective duties and for that reason the appellant has no right to a mandamus. The appellant contends that the conclusion of the learned justice in appeal is erroneous and that on the other hand there occurred a series of acts on the part of the various university bodies considering his appeals which amounted in each case to such a denial of natural justice as would render the decisions arrived at nullities.\nHall J.A. concluded his reasons with the statement:\nThe appellant really takes the position that the proceedings were conducted in a manner which amounted to a denial of natural justice. Even if this were true, mandamus is not, however, the appropriate remedy to obtain a review of the proceedings.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nIf this Court is of the opinion that there existed such a denial of natural justice as would nullify the decisions of the special appeal committee, the executive committee, the faculty council, and the senate appeal committee, it would be required to determine whether mandamus was a procedure available to the appellant. First, however, we must determine whether such denial of natural justice occurred.\nCounsel for the university has admitted that the appellant in his letter of August 8, 1964, addressed to the president, by which he initiated his appeal, included a request that he have an opportunity to be present and to be represented upon the hearing of his appeal. The president replied to that letter by his letter of August 14, 1964, in which he stated, in part:\nIt would be helpful if you would send a detailed plea, as mentioned in the second page of your letter. If the Committee feels that it would be helpful for you to appear before them, I will let you know.\nIn reply, the appellant did submit what might well be termed a \u201cdetailed brief\u201d. This brief was produced as an exhibit to the president\u2019s affidavit and runs to nine and a half closely-typed pages. In such brief, the appellant did not repeat his request that he be present in person at the hearing or that he be represented by counsel. On the other hand, of course, he did not withdraw that request.\nThe committee met on four occasions: September 25, 1964, October 6, 1964, November 18, 1964, and November 24, 1964, and it submitted to the executive committee of the faculty council a carefully considered report in some considerable detail. It is true the appellant was never notified of any of those four meetings or given any opportunity to be either present in person or represented by counsel. On the other hand, Dean Otto Lang, the presiding officer of the University of Saskatchewan Law School, whom the appellant has regarded as his opponent throughout, was present at the last two meetings and was assisted by at least one law professor. Whatever allegations of denial of natural justice the appellant seeks to advance, based on the failure to permit him or his counsel to be present at the hearings of this special appeal committee, are met and defeated by the fact that this special appeal committee concluded its report with the recommendation which it set out in the following words:\nWhile this Committee recognizes that R.D. King has not fulfilled the requirements for graduation in Law either according to the old merit point regulations or the new average regulations, nevertheless, the Committee recommends that, due to the exceptional circumstances surrounding the case and for compassionate reasons, this student be awarded the Bachelor of Laws Degree.\nIn my view, such a recommendation disposes of the consideration of any allegations as to lack of natural justice in the hearings of the special appeal committee.\nThis report with the above recommendation was presented to the executive committee of council on December 15, 1964. The solicitors for the university informed those of the appellant that there were present at such meeting of the executive committee the president, eight deans, including Dean Lang of the law school, an acting dean and thirteen professors, including at least one from the law school. Again, the appellant was given no notice of that meeting or opportunity to be present or to be represented by counsel. According to the minutes of a full university council, dated June 14, 1967, to which I have referred above, the report of the special appeal committee was presented in full with its recommendation, and it was considered by this executive committee on December 15, 1964. The motion to adopt the report of the special appeal committee \u201cwas lost by large majority\u201d. The executive committee (sometimes in the material referred to simply as the \u201cExecutive\u201d) recommended that the appellant be not granted the degree. As I have said, the matter was then considered by the full university council on February 18, 1965. This is a very large body. Although the minutes of the particular meeting of February 18, 1965, are not amongst the material, at the later meeting of the council, referred to above, in which that body reviewed its decision of February 18, 1965, there were 179 members present. The minutes of the latter meeting recite that the report of the special appeal committee and the recommendation of the executive were presented to the full university council and that the university council rejected the recommendation of the special appeal committee and agreed with the recommendation of the executive committee that the appellant be not granted his degree. Again, at this meeting of the full faculty council the appellant was not given an opportunity to be present or to be represented by counsel.\nI realize that each case must be considered on its own circumstances. This is not such a situation as was considered in Ridge v. Baldwin[5], where a chief constable had been discharged by a watch committee, or in Posluns v. Toronto Stock Exchange[6], where the plaintiff Posluns had been held by a committee of the Toronto Stock Exchange to be disqualified from acting as a director or employee of a particular firm. What was being considered here was whether the appellant had attained the necessary standing in his studies in the law school to justify the granting to him of a, degree of bachelor of laws. As was pointed out in the Dunsheath case, supra, and the Thorne case, supra, such a matter is essentially a domestic one within the university. The considerations which are given to such an issue are not those which can be assisted by an adversary formula, and it is difficult to conceive of a situation which would have the representatives of a law school faculty confronting the representatives of a student in the trial of an issue as to whether a degree should be granted. It must be remembered, however, that this appellant in his brief, which need not be analyzed in detail, made many contentions which were not solely related to his attainment of academic qualifications, and indeed as the chancellor pointed out in his report, to which further reference shall be made hereafter, the essence of the appellant\u2019s complaints were:\n(1) that there was a breach of the terms of registration between him and the university, (2) that there was a breach of ethics which amounted to a value judgment.\nWhether this allegation of the denial of natural justice, in what may be termed private or academic bodies, would provide the appellant with the basis for proceedings in the ordinary Courts to have the decisions of such bodies declared nullities is a question of some importance. In view of my opinion as expressed hereunder, it need not be decided in the present case.\nThe appellant was not satisfied to leave this matter as disposed of by the full faculty council but, as I have pointed out, appealed to the chancellor. The chancellor then appointed a committee, guided therein by the statutes of the university, and this committee met on November 3, 1965. The chancellor has sworn and, of course, there is no contradiction, that the procedure arrived at for the hearing of the appeal by the special senate appeal committee was only determined after consultation and discussion with counsel for the appellant and in the presence of the appellant and that that procedure was agreed upon. Both the appellant and his counsel were aware of the intention to first hear the appellant and his counsel and then to hear Dean Otto Lang in the absence of the appellant. No objection was made by either the appellant or his counsel to that procedure and the procedure was carried out. This senate appeal committee was composed of the chief justice of the province, the president of the university, and three deans, all being persons of eminent qualification, and it can only be presumed to have given the appeal of the present appellant every possible consideration. As I have said, the procedure adopted was one of which the appellant knew and both he and his counsel had approved.\nCounsel for the appellant in this Court made the submission that at that hearing the appellant did not have the advantage of full knowledge of what had gone before, and noted that until after the special senate committee had conducted its hearing and made its report, he did not know that the special appeal committee had recommended that despite his lack of qualifications he be granted a degree because of the exceptional circumstances and upon compas- sionate grounds. I am of the opinion that counsel was in error in that submission. The appellant in his affidavit in support of the application for mandamus swore:\n8. That I was informed both by telephone and letter during the latter part of December, 1964, by the President that an adverse report was to be made to the Faculty Council and that after some conversation by telephone, the President did admit to me that his own Special Committee had been interfered with and subsequently over-ruled by an ad hoc committee or committees which had sat and adjudicated on my case without notice to me and without my having any knowledge of the hearing, and had tried my case in my absence.\nThe only inference from that evidence is that the appellant knew in December 1964 that the special appeal committee had recommended that his appeal be granted and that that recommendation had been rejected by what the appellant there refers to as \u201can ad hoc committee or committees\u201d.\nThe president, in his affidavit, sworn on September 11, 1968, has taken issue with the appellant\u2019s affidavit on the grounds that he would not have used the word \u201coverruled\u201d because the special appeal committee was not empowered to make a ruling but only a recommendation. I am of the opinion that such a matter of wording is irrelevant upon the present issue. It matters not whether the president used the word \u201coverruled\u201d or whether the president spoke of a recommendation which was rejected. At any rate, it is perfectly plain that the appellant knew in December 1964 that the recommendation made by the special appeal committee was that he should have a degree and knew that that recommendation had been rejected by the executive, although he might not even have known that such a body as one formally termed the \u201cexecutive\u201d existed. Surely, in the hearing before the senate appeal committee this early success would have been strongly urged by either the appellant or his counsel.\nI have come to the conclusion, upon this examination of the facts, that there was no lack of natural justice before the senate appeal committee and that the proceedings in fact were carried out with the full knowledge and approval of the appellant and his counsel. It must be noted that the statutory duty of the faculty council as enacted by s. 76(c) of The University Act was expressly subject to appeal to the senate. Moreover, the senate, in the University of Saskatchewan as elsewhere, is the sole body determining to whom the degrees of the university may be granted. Any possible failure of natural justice before the special appeal committee, the executive committee, or the full faculty council, is quite unimportant when the senate, the appeal body under the provisions of The University Act, and also the body in control of the granting of degrees, has exercised its function with no failure to accord natural justice. If there were any absence of natural justice in the inferior tribunals, it was cured by the presence of such natural justice before the senate appeal committee.\nA similar matter was considered in Posluns v. Toronto Stock Exchange, supra, and Ritchie J., giving the reasons for the Court, distinguished the circumstances there present, where the second hearing was one in which the appellant was accorded a full measure of natural justice, from the situation in Ridge v. Baldwin, supra, where, as Lord Reid pointed out at p. 79:\nBut here the appellant\u2019s solicitor was not fully informed of the charges against the appellant and the watch committee did not annul the decision which they had already published and proceed to make a new decision. In my judgment, what was done on that day was a very inadequate substitute for a full rehearing.\nI am of the opinion that the situation here resembles that in Posluns v. Toronto Stock Exchange, supra, and that the hearing before the senate appeal committee, a small and very able body, was such as accorded the appellant every advantage of natural justice and rendered nugatory any alleged earlier failure to accord him such natural justice in any of the earlier hearings.\nReference should be made to another submission by counsel for the appellant. That submission was that in each case when his appeals were being considered by the successive tribunals, there was a duplication of membership in the body with an earlier tribunal.\nThe special appeal committee was as follows:\nPresident:\nJ. W. T. Spinks\nDeans:\nBooth, Haslam and Tracey\nProfessors:\nMann, Langley, Pepper. The composition of the executive committee was:\nChairman:\nThe President, J. W. T. Spinks\nDeans:\nBegg, Booth, Currie, Haslam, Kirkpatrick, Lang and Smith\nActing Dean:\nGoodspeed\nProfessors:\nBuckley, Chambers, Douglas, DuWors, Katz, Langley, Ludwig, McMurray, Mann, Nind, Pepper, Rempel, D. C. Williams (I omit those not voting).\nAs I have pointed out the full faculty council meeting on February 18, 1965, had a very large number present and I am ready to presume included many of those whom I have already named.\nThe senate appeal committee was composed of:\nThe Chancellor:\nChief Justice Culliton\nThe President:\nJ. W. T. Spinks\nDeans:\nBarber, Begg, Currie.\nThere was therefore the duplication of which the appellant complains. The appellant has cited a series of cases including Frome United Breweries Co. v. Bath Justices[7]; R. v. Alberta Securities Commission, Ex p. Albrecht[8]; and R. v. Ontario Labour Relations Board, Ex p. Hall[9], for the proposition that under such circumstances there is a presumption of bias in favour of the former decision to which the member objected to was a party and that the decision should therefore be quashed. It is to be noted that those decisions all deal with either appeals from one administrative body to another or appeals from a licensing committee to the justice of the peace. In my view, they are inappropriate to apply to the situation under review in this appeal. These were all university bodies. It was inevitable that there would be duplication as one proceeded from one body to another; so, it was perfectly proper that the president of the university should be a member of the special appeal committee which he set up to consider the appeal that had been made originally to him. Again, the executive of the faculty council could not be presided over by anyone more fit for the office than the chief member of the faculty, that is, the president. And finally, the president of the university as vice-chancellor thereof was required, by the university statute, to be a member of the senate appeal committee. The other duplications are of persons carrying out their ordinary duties as members of the faculty of the University of Saskatchewan.\nIt was significant that no member of any of the bodies was a member of the faculty of the law school, and that when the dean or members of that faculty attended any of the bodies they withdrew before voting. I am of the opinion that, in such matters as were the concern of the various university bodies here, duplication was proper and was to be expected, and I am not ready to agree that such duplication would result in any bias or constitute a breach of natural justice.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Newsham & Raney, Saskatoon.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Francis, Gauley, Dierker & Dahlem, Saskatoon.\n[1] (1969), 67 W.W.R. 126, 1 D.L.R.

Following the collision of two motor vehicles, in which accident C (the driver of one of the vehicles) was killed, three actions were brought and tried together. The trial judge found that both the deceased and the appellant L (the driver of the other vehicle) had been negligent and apportioned liability at 50 per cent to each driver.\nThe accident took place on a gravel road which was dry and very dusty. L was travelling northward at about 50 m.p.h. and was preceded by another vehicle which threw up a cloud of dust. This dust restricted the visibility of the deceased who was driving towards the south. As her automobile and that of L approached one another C\u2019s vehicle crossed over on to the northbound lane and the two vehicles met almost head on. The evidence established that when the collision occurred the left side of L\u2019s vehicle was either at or slightly to the left of the centre of the highway.\nL was awarded $27,500 general damages plus $500 to cover plastic surgery and $500 for dental work. Special damages were fixed at $10,139. By way of counterclaim the executors of the estate of C were awarded $7,500 under The Trustee Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 346, and an additional sum of $30,000 under The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 111. An appeal from the trial judgment was dismissed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, one member of the Court dissenting on the question of the division of liability. L then appealed to this Court from the division of liability and from the damages awarded to the estate of C.\nHeld: The appeal as to percentage of liability should be allowed; the appeal as to damages should be dismissed.\nThe major responsibility for the collision lay upon the deceased driver. Her negligence was beyond question. The automobile she was driving was almost entirely on its wrong side of the road.\nHowever, L was also in a measure at fault. A prudent and reasonable man would not hug the centre of a dust-covered highway at a speed of 50 m.p.h. without being aware that there was the likelihood that a driver bound in the opposite direction could also be driving at or near the centre, and that that driver might accidentally cross over or emerge from the dust too late for either driver to avoid meeting more or less head on. L was found to be 25 per cent at fault.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Primrose J. in three actions which arose out of a motor vehicle accident and were tried together.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014Three actions arising out of the same motor vehicle collision were tried together by Primrose J. in the Supreme Court of Alberta. He found both drivers equally at fault and apportioned liability at 50 per cent to each driver.\nIn Action No. 53614 in which the appellant Lotholz was plaintiff, he fixed Lotholz\u2019s damages at $27,500 general plus $500 to cover plastic surgery and $500 for dental work, and he also fixed the amount of the special damages at $10,139. In Action No. 54769 he fixed Lotholz\u2019s special damages at $3,615. In Action No. 54290 he fixed Shirley Charlton\u2019s general damages at $3,000 and William Charlton\u2019s special damages at $967.60. In Action No. 53614 he fixed the damages by way of counterclaim payable by Lotholz to the executors of the estate of Emily Charlton, deceased, at $7,500 under The Trustee Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 346, and an additional sum of $30,000 under The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 111, and he also awarded William Charlton the sum of $1,175 special damages. The learned trial judge also ordered that Lotholz have costs in the sum of $500 plus disbursements; that Shirley Charlton have costs in the sum of $250 plus disbursements, and that Canada West Insurance Company have costs in the sum of $200 plus disbursements.\nCanada West Insurance Company was joined on its application as a third party in Actions Nos. 53614 and 54769 pursuant to s. 302 of The Alberta Insurance Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 159, and was represented by counsel at the trial.\nThe appellant Lotholz appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta in all three actions against Primrose J.\u2019s division of liability at 50 per cent and against that portion of the judgment in Action No. 53614 by which damages in the sum of $37,500 were fixed by Primrose J. in favour of the executors of the estate of Emily Charlton, deceased, and against that portion of the judgment in Action No. 54769 by which the third party, Canada West Insurance Company, was awarded costs in the sum of $200 and disbursements.\nThe Appellate Division dismissed the appeal with costs. Johnson J.A., dissenting, would have reduced Lotholz\u2019s negligence and liability to 25 per cent instead of the 50 per cent fixed by Primrose J. The third party was given no costs in connection with the appeal.\nLotholz now appeals to this Court and claims that he should not have been held liable at all or, in any event if liable, that his percentage of fault was much less than that of the deceased, Emily Charlton, the driver of the Charlton vehicle. He also appeals against the amounts awarded to the executors of the Emily Charlton estate.\nThe facts are relatively simple. The collision between the Lotholz and the Charlton vehicles took place at about 8:45 a.m. on May 12, 1966. The vehicles met on a gravel road some 2\u00bd miles south of the Town of Barrhead in the Province of Alberta. Lotholz was driving his automobile northward toward Barrhead. The gravel highway was approximately 24 feet in width with gravel shoulders on each side of approximately 3 feet, giving an overall width of 30 feet 6 inches from ditch to ditch. There was no line or indication fixing the centre of the highway which had to be determined by measurement. The road on the morning in question was dry and very dusty. Visibility on the westerly half of the highway was very restricted by clouds of dust raised by traffic on the road whereas visibility on the eastern side of the highway was relatively better because an easterly wind was carrying the dust westward across the highway. Lotholz was preceded northward by another vehicle which threw up a cloud of dust as it went towards Barrhead. Lotholz was sufficiently far in rear of this vehicle that he had reasonably good visibility. He could not, however, see what was on the west half of the highway or the vehicle which was ahead of him.\nThe deceased, Emily Charlton, was driving the Charlton automobile southward on this highway and she met the vehicle which was preceding Lotholz some distance to the north of where the collision took place. Her visibility was undoubtedly restricted by the dust thrown up by the vehicle she just met and as the Charlton and Lotholz automobiles came towards one another the Charlton vehicle crossed over on to the northbound lane and the two vehicles met almost head on. As they met the Charlton vehicle was a matter of some 5 feet over the centre of the highway. Lotholz, who was driving with the left side of his automobile at or on the centre of the highway, saw the Charlton automobile emerge from the dust on his side of the road. He applied his brakes and skid marks 44 feet in length were discernible on the highway after the impact. There were no marks or indications of the application of brakes by the driver of the Charlton automobile.\nThe negligence of the deceased, Emily Charlton, is beyond question. The automobile she was driving was almost entirely on its wrong side of the road. The question for decision is whether Lotholz was negligent at all, and if negligent, what percentage of fault should be assessed against him?\nThe evidence establishes that when the collision occurred the left side of the Lotholz vehicle was either at or slightly to the left of the centre of the highway. There was considerable argument about the exact position of the Lotholz automobile in this regard, but in my view I do not think it is material to determine the location of the left side of the Lotholz vehicle to the inch in relation to the centre of the highway. The fact is that Lotholz was hugging the centre of the highway as he proceeded northward and he had no vision at all of what traffic might be coming southward on the west side of the highway. As stated, the highway, including the gravel shoulders on both sides, was 30 feet 6 inches wide. The centre of the highway was, therefore, 15 feet 3 inches from the outer edge of the east ditch. The east shoulder was approximately 3 feet wide so there remained 12 feet 3 inches on the east side of the centre for Lotholz to drive upon. His automobile was 80 inches in width. He could have driven some 5 feet closer to the east side of the highway without going on the east shoulder, and, in my opinion, it was negligence for him to drive at 50 miles per hour under the conditions as they existed at the time in question. It is true that there would probably have been a collision in any event even if Lotholz had been driving closer to the right shoulder as he should have been doing, but as against that, the driver of the Charlton vehicle might have been able to swerve to her right if she had not been faced with the Lotholz vehicle almost head on or Lotholz might, on seeing the Charlton vehicle, have avoided the collision by swerving a foot or so to his right.\nThe major responsibility for the collision must rest upon the driver of the Charlton automobile, but I cannot conclude that Lotholz was not also in a measure at fault. The classic definition of negligence is the omission to do something which a reasonable man guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do. I do not think that a prudent and reasonable man would hug the centre of that highway, dust-covered as it was, and do so at a speed of 50 miles per hour without being aware that there was the likelihood that a southbound driver could also be driving at or near the centre, and that that driver might accidentally cross over or emerge from the dust too late for either driver to avoid meeting more or less head on.\nThe learned trial judge fixed the responsibility for the accident equally on both drivers. As previously stated, the major responsibility must rest on the driver of the Charlton automobile. Johnson J.A. in the Appellate Division fixed Lotholz\u2019s negligence at 25 per cent. I am prepared to accept his finding of 25 per cent. The judgment at trial should be varied accordingly and the amounts for which the parties are to have judgment calculated on this basis.\nThe damages awarded under The Fatal Accidents Act are on the generous side, but the amount is not such that I can say it is a completely erroneous assessment which should be set aside.\nI would, accordingly, allow Lotholz\u2019s appeal in so far as the percentage of liability is concerned, but dismiss the appeal as to damages.\nLotholz is entitled to his costs of the appeal in this Court and in the Appellate Division. The order made by Primrose J. regarding the costs of trial should stand.\nAppeal as to percentage of liability allowed, appeal as to damages dismissed; with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wood, Moir, Hyde & Ross; Brower, Johnson, Liknaitzky, Robertson, Shamchuk & Veale, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the respondent Charlton et al.: Bishop, McKenzie, Jackson & Redmond, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the respondent third party: Kosowan & Wachowich, Edmonton.\n",

Both driver and passenger were killed. The crossing traversed seven sets of tracks, the two most northerly of which were used for through traffic and the remainder were for siding and switching. The collision occurred on the track referred to as No. 1 (reference to the tracks being made by number from north to south), and at the time of the accident there was a string of box cars standing to the east of the crossing on track No. 4. These cars limited to a certain extent the easterly vision of the northbound motorist.\nAt the trial the judge took from the jury the question of liability and left to them only the assessment of the damages. On appeal from the subsequent dismissal of the actions, the Court decided that the judge had improperly dismissed the jury as to liability. They ordered a new trial since, in their opinion, there was some evidence on which the jury might have found negligence on the part of the railway which caused or contributed to the accident. On appeal to this Court, the railway contended that there was error in interfering with the discretionary decision of the trial judge to dispense with the jury on the question of liability; that the railway was not negligent; and that the sole cause of the accident was the negligence of the driver of the car.\nHeld (Cartwright C.J. and Spence J. dissenting in part): The appeals should be allowed and the trial judgments restored.\nPer Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: There was good reason for the trial judge\u2019s decision to dispense with the jury on the question of liability. The assumption by the Court of Appeal of power to review this decision was in conflict with decisions in this Court which hold that the exercise of a trial judge\u2019s discretion to dispense with the jury is not a reviewable matter.\nThere was no evidence that the railway company had failed in any manner to comply with the provisions of the Railway Act or any order of the Board of Transport Commissioners, and there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the passenger train crew, either by breach of statute or running orders or at common law.\nOn the facts of the case, the trial judge was right in concluding that the box cars which were standing to the east of the crossing on track 4 could not be evidence of a dangerous situation created by the railway. The doctrine of exceptional or special circumstances was one to be applied with great care. It had no application here.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Spence J., dissenting in part: The Court of Appeal erred in holding that it could review and reverse the decision made by the trial judge in the exercise of his proper discretion to remove from the jury\u2019s consideration the question of liability.\nAs to the question of liability, the appellant railway was negligent in not providing some better warning under the special and exceptional circumstances present in this case. Those exceptional circumstances were that the crossing of the main line occurred after the unwary motorist had travelled north over five storage tracks some of which on both sides of the road bore standing box cars apparently merely stored at that place, and failing to provide an indication that the two tracks upon which the motorist should last come were not mere storage tracks but through lines upon which trains were entitled to proceed at 55 m.p.h.\nOn the evidence, the conclusion was reached that the driver contributed 25 per cent of the negligence which caused the accident while the railway company contributed 75 per cent. The passenger was a gratuitous passenger and therefore the provisions of s. 2(2) of The Negligence Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 261, applied to the claim by his administrator who should be able to recover only 75 per cent of the damages as found by the jury.\nAccordingly, the appeals should be allowed only to strike out the judgment of the Court of Appeal granting to the respondents a new trial but then the trial judgment should be varied to allow each of the plaintiffs to recover 75 per cent of the damages found by the jury in their actions.\n[Telford v.

Appeals allowed and judgments at trial restored, Cartwright C.J. and Spence J. dissenting in part.\nJohn J. Robinette, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nArthur Maloney, Q.C., and J. Douglas Crane, for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and Spence J. was delivered by\nSPENCE J. (dissenting in part):\u2014These reasons apply to two appeals from judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1. By those judgments, the Court allowed the appeal of the plaintiffs Babudro and Sdraulig and directed a new trial of the two actions.\nThe two said plaintiffs had taken action against the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for damages due to the deaths of the late Angelo Babudro and Livia Sdraulig in a collision with a train owned and operated by the defendant Canadian Pacific Railway Company. The action had proceeded to trial with a jury before Moorhouse J. After all of the evidence had been completed, for reasons to which I shall hereafter refer, Moorhouse J. removed the question of liability from consideration by the jury but left with them the fixing of the quantum of damages. His Lordship then charged the jury upon the damages and, during the time the jury was considering its verdict, he heard argument upon the question of liability. The jury having announced its verdict as to the quantum of damages, from which there is no appeal, His Lordship reserved judgment and later, by written reasons, dismissed the action. In the Court of Appeal, the two appeals were argued in full but the Court of Appeal first considered the question as to whether the removal of the issue of liability from the consideration of the jury was proper, and determined that the trial judge erred in adopting such a course. The Court of Appeal then proceeded to determine that evidence had been adduced upon which a jury, properly charged, could have found the defendant railway company negligent and directed a new trial before a jury as to liability only.\nThe first problem for this Court is whether the Court of Appeal erred in reversing the decision of the learned trial judge that the question of liability should be removed from the jury\u2019s consideration. The learned trial judge, when he announced his decision, gave his reasons in the following paragraph:\nNow, this case has been a most distressing case, and in view of counsel\u2019s question put to the witness Campbell when he was called in reply\u2014in view of that being put in the presence of the jury, and in view of the general conduct of the trial, and certainly in view of the statements of counsel in respect of the law applicable, I feel that true justice cannot be done by leaving this case on the question of liability to the jury. I am taking from them the question of liability.\nThe learned trial judge extended the grounds upon which he had acted but, as Schroeder J.A. noted in his reasons for judgment, in the Court of Appeal for Ontario, counsel for the respondent railway company (here the appellant) placed no reliance upon such further grounds. Schroeder J.A. then continued:\nViewing the evidence as a whole I am constrained to look upon this as one of those extreme cases in which the Court ought to intervene since, quite aside from his failure to give counsel an opportunity to argue the point and to put the plaintiffs to their election as previously mentioned, the learned judge\u2019s discretion was exercised upon such tenous grounds that it cannot be regarded as the exercise of a judicial discretion at all.\nand therefore directed a new trial with a jury. Schroeder J.A. recognized the \u201cwell-settled rule that the exercise of discretion by a trial judge should not be interfered with except in extreme cases\u201d, but also noted that the Courts had not hesitated to interfere if the learned trial judge\u2019s discretion was exercised \u201cunder a mistake in law, in disregard of principle, under misapprehension as to facts, that he failed to exercise his discretion or that his order would result in an injustice\u201d. It would appear that the learned justice in appeal found some of these circumstances existed in the present case. In my respectful opinion, the proposition that a court of appeal may interfere with the discretion of a trial judge was stated much too broadly in applying it to the decision of such trial judge during the course of a trial to dispense with the assistance of a jury and dispose of the issues himself.\nIn Ontario as long ago as Brown v. Wood[2], at p. 200, Chancellor Boyd said:\nThe difficulty is to get over sec. 255 of the C.L.P. Act. If this were an appeal from the order of a Judge in Chambers striking out a jury notice, before the trial, the cases cited by Mr. Read would be overwhelming in his favour, but the discretion of a Judge at the trial is much larger\u2026 As no affidavit of merits has been filed, and the defendant has not brought and does not seek to bring the amount of the verdict into Court, and as the motion is against a discretion that the trial Judge undoubtedly has to determine the method of trial, it should be dismissed, with costs.\nThat statement of principal has been cited and adopted since then in a long series of cases both in the Courts of Ontario and in this Court. In Wise v. Canadian Bank of Commerce[3], Middleton J. said at p. 345:\nIt has been held that the discretion conferred upon the Judge presiding at the trial is an absolute discretion, not subject to review: Brown v. Wood, supra.\nIn Currie v. Motor Union Insurance Co.[4], Latchford C.J., for the Court, said:\nEven before the enactment of sec. 56(3) the discretion of a trial Judge in dispensing with a jury was not interfered with by an appellate Court: Brown v. Wood supra. It was within the power of the trial Judge to determine the method of trial, and his, determination was not open to review.\nSee also Wilson v. Kinnear[5], per Middleton J.A. at p. 680; Telford v. Secord; Telford v. Nasmith[6], where Kellock J. said at p. 282:\nThere rests with the trial judge sufficient power and authority to conduct the trial as it should be conducted, and, should he see reason to try the action without a jury or to dispense with the jury at any stage, his discretion is not subject to review; Currie v. Motor Union Insurance Co. (1924) 27 O.W.N. 99; Wilson v. Kinnear (1925) 57 O.L.R. 679. And in Mizinski v. Robillard and McLaughlin[7], Cartwright J. (as he then was) said at p. 356:\nI have quoted from the above judgments, and there are many others containing expressions to the same effect, for the purpose of indicating that the order of a trial judge dispensing with a jury during the course of, the trial is consistently treated as the exercise of a discretion vested in him by the statute. There may be cases in which the order could be shown to have been made otherwise, as for example if the judge in his reasons made it clear that he had discharged the jury only because he had erroneously decided that he was bound as a matter of law to do so. Logan et al. v. Wilson et al., [1943] 4 D.L.R. 512, was a case of this sort.\nLogan et al. v. Wilson et al.[8], to which Cartwright J. referred, was a case in which the trial judge acceded to an application by the counsel for the defence to discharge the jury mistakenly believing that if some of the evidence might tend to show medical malpractice in an attempt to reduce damages he was bound to remove the matter from the jury.\nAnother example of such unusual circumstances is the case where the existence of insurance is revealed in some answer of a witness. A whole series of cases in Ontario would appear to have resulted in a special jurisprudence and should not be extended beyond that type of case. Pillion v. O\u2019Neill[9], cited by Schroeder J.A. in his reasons, was one of these cases in which a witness for the plaintiff in answer to a question put by the trial judge accidentally revealed that the defendant was insured. The portions of the judgment at pp. 727 and 728 referred to by Schroeder J.A. were concerned with the failure of the trial judge to permit the plaintiff to elect whether he might proceed without a jury or take an adjournment to the next sittings. No such situation existed here. Here, the learned trial judge dispensed with the jury for the reasons which he stated carefully and which he, in the exercise of his discretion, regarded as providing adequate basis for such a course in order to ensure that justice should be done. Although it would appear that the learned trial judge did not request counsel to submit argument on the topic before making the statement which I have quoted above, he certainly permitted counsel for the plaintiff to make submissions at length immediately thereafter and before the jury was recalled and instructed. Since it was only this latter event which foreclosed the matter, I am not ready to conclude that the learned trial judge did not permit argument.\nFor these reasons, I am of the respectful opinion that the Court of Appeal for Ontario erred in holding that it could review and reverse the decision made by the trial judge in the exercise of his proper discretion to remove from the jury\u2019s consideration the question of liability. Having determined that it could so review the learned trial judge\u2019s decision, the Court of Appeal were only called upon to determine that there was evidence which, when submitted to a jury upon a new trial, would have permitted that jury to find negligence on the part of the railway company. After a review of the facts and the many authorities dealing with level crossing accidents, the Court of Appeal determined that there was such evidence and therefore directed a new trial.\nHaving come to the conclusion that the learned trial judge\u2019s removal of the question of liability from the jury was not open to review, I therefore am required to proceed to consider the correctness of his judgment on the question of liability. This entails a rather detailed consideration of the facts and application thereto of the authorities to which I have referred.\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway had, for many years, a double-track line running into Port Arthur. When the city grew larger, the city authorities desired to cross the line with a municipal road known as Clavet Street. Upon the city\u2019s application, the Board of Railway Commissioners, by its Order No. 12083 of October 24, 1910, permitted the city to construct such crossing. Provisions in such order as to maintenance are not relevant here. The appellant railway owned the lands to each side of Clavet Street to the south of its main line and by orders of the Board of Railway Commissioners made on various dates thereafter, it was permitted to construct five more crossings over Clavet Street. The railway right of way over these five crossings was some 10 to 12 feet higher than Clavet Street to the north and south, so there was an upgrade of that street at both sides of the railway property. Therefore, in 1964 when the accident occurred Clavet Street running northerly from the bay area went up a grade and then crossed at level these five tracks of the appellant\u2019s storage yards which were at each side of the street and finally the double-track main line. The southerly of the latter two tracks was for east-bound traffic and the northerly for westbound.\nIt was found convenient at trial and thereafter to refer to these tracks by numbers from one to seven, numbers 1 and 2 being the main line through-traffic tracks and numbers 3 to 7 inclusive being the freight car storage tracks. The distance from the north rail of track No. 1 to the south rail of track No. 7 was 89 feet and the distance from the southerly rail of track No. 1 to the northerly rail of track No. 4 was 36 feet. At the time of the accident, box cars stood on tracks Nos. 4 and 7, both to the east and west of Clavet Street. The box cars west of Clavet Street were 36 feet west of the street on track No. 7 and 92 feet west of the street on track No. 4, while those cars to the east of Clavet Street were 50 feet east of the street on track No. 7 and 47 feet or 47 feet 9 inches (the variation in the evidence is inconsequential) on track No. 4.\nOn February 17, 1964, a fine, sunny, mild day, the deceased Dante Sdraulig, to conduct some business in the office of the Great West Timber Limited on the Lakeshore Road, which ran from east to west south of this railway property, drove to that firm\u2019s office. He was accompanied in his motor car by his brother-in-law, the deceased Ferruccio Babudro. After a few moments, the two drove northerly on Clavet Street arriving at the crossing of the main line at almost exactly 1:40 p.m. and there the motor car collided with a locomotive of the appellant railway\u2019s transcontinental train, the Canadian, which was westbound on track No. 1. Both men were killed instantly and the vehicle, totally destroyed, tossed down the embankment to the north of track No. 1 about 76 feet west of the west limit of Clavet Street. The train which consisted of two diesel locomotives, a baggage car and fourteen passenger cars, stopped with the leading locomotive 1,425 feet west of Clavet Street. Only three persons other than the deceased occupants of the motor car were eye-witnesses of the impact; the engineer and fireman of the train, and Mr. Robert Campbell, who was repairing his automobile outside a residence on the north side of the right-of-way about 300 feet or more east of Clavet Street. The engineer Guina and Campbell gave evidence. The fireman was not called nor his absence from the trial explained. At the trial, all the witnesses agreed that the view of a northbound motorist approaching the main line would be blocked by these standing box cars and much evidence was tendered as to \u201cview lines\u201d. This evidence dealt with the view to the east from which direction the Canadian had approached Clavet Street. It may be summarized as follows: Constable MacDonnell swore that the upgrade on Clavet Street levelled out as it crossed track No. 6 and that point 72 feet south of the north rail of track No. 1 he chose as the first point at which a northbound motor car would level out and permit a good view to east and west. The constable then sighted past the north\u2011west corner of the box car standing on track No. 4 at a distance which he found to be 47 feet east of Clavet Street, and determined that his view line crossed the north rail of track No. 1 at a point 117 feet east of the east side of Clavet Street William E. Mercer, a professional engineer, called for the defendant railway, agreed with this evidence although he chose a point 70 feet 4 inches south of the centre of the two rails of track No. 1 and he found that his view line past the corner of the box car sitting on track No. 4 struck the north rail of the main line westbound at a point 118 feet 8 inches east of Clavet Street. I see no practical difference between the evidence of the two witnesses. Mr. Mercer also produced an exhibit which was intended to illustrate the lengthening of the view to the east along the tracks which a motorist would experience as he drove northerly from that point 70 feet 4 inches south of the centre line of track No. 1. This exhibit was not the result of observation and measurement at the site but was a calculation based on the original observation at the 70 feet 4 inches point. By that table, he illustrated that the view to the east lengthened as the car proceeded northerly at first by quite small distances but thereafter by rapidly increasing distances so that when the motorist reached a point 42 feet south of the centre line of track No. 1 his view to the east extended for a distance of 398 feet and thereafter his view to the east was unlimited.\nThe liability of the railway company must be considered under three different headings: firstly, the operation of the defendant railway\u2019s train, secondly, whether or not it was in breach of any statute or regulation, and, thirdly, even if it were not so in breach was it guilty of negligence in common law? As to the operation of the train, the learned trial judge found that the train was proceeding between 35 and 40 miles per hour and that that speed was reasonable in the circumstances and was not of any significance. The speed limit in the yard, and this was within the Port Arthur yard, was 55 miles per hour. The learned trial judge further found that the statutory warning signs were erected and the bell on the locomotive was ringing. A by-law of the municipality which had been approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners barred the operation of the whistle except in actual emergency. So soon as the fireman who rode on the left side of the locomotive saw the automobile driven by the deceased Sdraulig, which had just emerged into view on the crossing, and which would appear to have been at that time crossing track No. 4, he warned the engineer and the engineer, in view of the emergency, immediately sounded the whistle. Of course, that was much too late to be of any effect. It was the learned trial judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthere was no evidence from which I can attribute negligence to the train crew either from breach of statute, running orders or at common law\u201d. That is a finding of fact amply justified by the evidence.\nI turn next to the respondents\u2019 submission that the appellant was in breach of the provisions of the Uniform Code of Operating Rules. There was produced at trial a copy of this Code which was effective on October 28, 1962, and thereafter which therefore governed the conduct of the appellant railway at the time of the accident. The respondent points out a provision of rule 103 which reads:\nWhen necessary to cut trains at public crossings at grade, except where a member of the crew is to protect the crossing, or where other protection is provided, cars or engines must not be left standing within 100 feet of the travelled portion of the public road.\nThat paragraph is only one of many paragraphs in rule. 103 and must be considered with all other parts of the same rule. I quote the complete rule:\n103. When cars are pushed by an engine, except when switching or making up trains in yards, and even then when conditions require, a member of the crew must be on the leading car and in a position from which signals necessary to the movement can be properly given.\nWhen cars not headed by an engine are passing along a public road or over a public crossing at grade which is not adequately protected by gates or otherwise, a member of the crew must be on the leading car to warn persons standing on, or crossing, or about to cross the track. No part of a car or engine may be allowed to occupy any part of a public crossing at grade for a longer period than five minutes, and a public crossing at grade must not be obstructed by switching operations, for more than five minutes at a time.\nWhen necessary to cut trains at public crossings at grade, except where a member of the crew is to protect the crossing, or where other protection is provided, cars or engines must not be left standing within 100 feet of the travelled portion of the public road.\nWhere special instructions require that switching movements over certain public crossings at grade be protected by a member of the crew, such protection must be provided by a member of the crew from a point on the ground at the crossing until the crossing is fully occupied.\nWhen a train or engine passes over any public crossing at grade protected by automatic signals or automatic gates, it will be necessary before making a reverse movement over the crossing for a member of the crew to protect the same.\nBefore making switching movements over unprotected public crossings at grade where the engineman\u2019s view of the crossing is obscured, arrangements must be made for a member of the crew to be in position to observe the crossing and give signals to the engineman as necessary.\nAt public crossings at grade at which there are automatic warning devices to indicate the approach of trains or engines on the main track, movements over such crossings on other than main tracks, must not, unless otherwise provided, exceed ten miles per hour from 100 feet distant until the engine or leading car has passed over the crossing.\nAt public crossings at grade referred to in time table instructions, where protection devices are required to be operated by use of push buttons or other appliances, movements must not obstruct the crossing until the protection devices have been operating for at least twenty seconds.\nIn the rules, \u201ctrain\u201d is defined as follows:\nAn engine or more than one engine coupled, with or without cars, displaying markers.\nIt will be seen that in order to have these standing box cars be part of a train for the purpose of the rule, they must be coupled with an engine. There was no evidence of any engine coupled to any of the standing box cars.\nIt is also significant that the whole rule deals with the operation of switching cars, that is, moving them from one place to the other, and is not a rule which is applicable to the situation existing in the present case where the car had stood stored for some indefinite time upon these tracks, numbered 3 to 7. The paragraph of rule 103 relied upon by the respondents, by its terms, applies only when it is necessary to cut trains at public crossings at grade. No such cutting of a train nor the necessity for such cutting of a train was proved in this particular case. It was quite possible that these box cars had been moved into their position from points east of or west of Clavet Street without ever having crossed Clavet Street and, therefore, it was quite possible that they never had been cut at Clavet Street. The paragraph of the rule being evidently for the protection of the public at level crossings against the movement of a \u201clive train\u201d simply had no application in the present circumstances, and the respondents fail in their reliance upon this rule to prove a breach of the statutory regulations in leaving the box cars standing where they stood particularly on track No. 4.\nCounsel for the appellant railway, however, submits that since rule 103 does not apply to the present circumstances, and since the Board of Railway Commissioners, as it then was, have not made any regulation requiring the stationary box cars not attached to the train be left any specific distance away from a roadway that there can be no negligence found against his client based on the position of the box cars. I am unable to accede to such a submission. In my view, counsel having contended, and rightly contended, that the paragraph of rule 103 cited by the respondent had no application, it necessarily follows that the Board simply has not dealt with this question and that negligence may exist when there has been no breach of the regulation of the Board.\nIn Anderson v. Canadian National Railway Co.[10], Robertson C.J.O. considered such a contention. At pp. 175 and 176, the learned Chief Justice said:\nIt will not be doubted, I think, that a railway company, such as appellant, has no more liberty than anyone else to be negligent. In Imerson v. Nipissing Central Railway Co., 57 O.L.R. 588 at p. 593, [1925] 4 D.L.R. 504, Masten J.A., in speaking of the matter of the speed at which the car of the railway company was travelling, said, \u201cBut the absence of any statutory limitation of speed does not absolve the defendant from its common law liability if it is negligent, and it still remains liable for negligence if, \u2018having regard to all the circumstances of the case, its employees omit that reasonable degree of care which the law justly requires of those who, in the exercise of their rights, are using an instrument of danger\u2019.\u201d The latter part of this statement is quoted from the judgment of King J. in Fleming v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company (1892), in 31 N.B.R. 318 at p. 345, which was adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada on appeal in (1893), 22 S.C.R. 33.\nThis principle has been applied in cases of accidents at highway crossings, two of which may be referred to as illustrations. First is The Lake Erie and Detroit River Railway Company v. Barclay (1900), 30 S.C.R. 360. In that case shunting operations were carried on near a highway crossing, and a train of cars was sent across a much frequented highway by what was called a \u201cflying switch\u201d, the engine being detached and the cars proceeding by their own momentum. It was held that it was properly left to the jury whether it was not necessary, at that particular time and under the particular circumstances, to take greater precautions than were taken, and to be much more careful than in ordinary cases where these conditions did not exist. In Montreal Trust Co. v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co., 61 O.L.R. 137, [1927] 4 D.L.R. 373, 33 C.R.C. 407, there was evidence that some box-cars of a freight train, placed on a passing-track to allow a passenger train to proceed on the main line, obstructed the view which the driver of a motor car would otherwise have had of the approaching passenger train. It was held that it was proper to submit to the jury the question whether, in the circumstances of the case, a duty was cast upon the railway company to take some precaution additional to the precautions prescribed by The Railway Act, and that it was open to the jury to find that the omission to take extra precaution was negligence.\nThere is nothing in the decisions in such cases as these I have referred to, in any way inconsistent with the principle laid down in The Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada v. McKay (1903), 34 S.C.R. 81, 3 C.R.C. 52. In that case Davies J. (in whose judgment the Chief Justice and Killam J. concurred), said at p. 97, referring to the powers conferred by The Railway Act upon the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, of determining the character and extent of the protection which should be given to the public at level highway crossings: \u201cI cannot think that these powers, so full, so complete, and so capable of being made effective, can if exercised be subject to review either as to their adequacy or otherwise by a jury, nor do I think that failure to invoke the exercise of the powers is of itself sufficient to take the matter away from the jurisdiction to which Parliament has committed it and vest it in a jury.\u201d\nThe result of the decisions seems to be that, under ordinary circumstances, the railway is permitted to carry on its usual operations in the normal way, at a highway level crossing, without other precautions and warnings than are prescribed by The Railway Act or by the Board, but if the operations are carried on in such a way, or are of such a character, that the public using the crossing is exposed to exceptional danger, as in the Barclay case, or if there are exceptional circumstances, as in the Montreal Trust Co. case, that render ineffective or insufficient the precautions and warnings generally prescribed, then, in such cases, it may be left to a jury to say whether or not the railway has been negligent in failing to adopt other measures for the protection of those who may use the crossing.\nWith respect, I adopt the view of the Chief Justice as to the decisions in the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada v. McKay case, and I am also of the view that Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Rutherford[11], at p. 613, does not carry the appellant railway any farther. The problem which remains, therefore, is to find whether, in the words of Chief Justice Robertson, there existed in this case such exceptional circumstances as would require the taking of other precautions.\nLet us consider the position of a motorist, any motorist, not particularly the deceased Mr. Sdraulig, who approached the scene driving northerly on Clavet Street. About 200 feet south of track No. 7, he would start to climb a grade which in the next 200 feet rose 10 or 12 feet. He would then find himself crossing a series of seven railroad tracks; on either side of Clavet Street, box cars stood on some of the tracks, particularly on track No. 7, which he reached first, and on track No. 4. It was therefore apparent to him from the many railroad tracks and from the box cars which stood on some of them, that he was driving through a railway yard. In a railway yard, he could expect shunting to take place but he also would know, as it is mere common sense to know, that such shunting would be accompanied by some sort of notice to him, from either the whistle or bell of a slow moving locomotive, or a warning by a trainman. Indeed, the various paragraphs of regulation 103 which I have cited above require this. The evidence reveals no variation of any kind in the appearance of the crossings to warn a northbound motorist that the last two tracks he is approaching, Nos. 2 and 1, are two express tracks. These two would appear simply the last two of seven shunting or storage tracks in the railway yard. When the motorist had proceeded to a point only 70 feet south of the centre of that track No. 1, he still feeling himself in the midst of a railroad yard, would, if he had taken a view only have had one to his right, that is, the east, of 118 feet 7 inches in length. A train travelling only at 35 miles an hour would cover that 118 feet 7 inches in a little less than 2.3 seconds. If the motorist were driving at 20 miles an hour, it would take exactly the same 2.3 seconds for him to travel the intervening 70 feet between his first lookout point and the track upon which the Canadian was running.\nMr. Mercer, in the exhibit which he prepared and filed, showed that if that box car standing on track No. 4 had stood 100 feet east of Clavet Street, the distance suggested in rule 103, rather than merely 47 feet 9 inches, the motorist at this point would have had a view to the east of 228 feet. A train travelling at 35 miles an hour would require 4.3 seconds plus to cover those 228 feet. Therefore, I am of the opinion that the appellant railway company was negligent in not providing some better warning under special and exceptional circumstances present in this case. Those exceptional circumstances are that the crossing of the main line occurred after the unwary motorist had travelled north over five storage tracks some of which on both sides of the road bore standing box cars apparently merely stored at that place, and failing to provide an indication that the two tracks upon which the motorist should last come were not mere storage tracks but through lines upon which trains were entitled to proceed at 55 miles an hour.\nThe appellant railway has pleaded the provisions of The Negligence Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 261. It is, therefore, necessary to consider the position of the late Mr. Sdraulig as he drove north over these seven tracks. Although the late Mr. Sdraulig was born in Europe, he had lived in Canada for about ten years prior to the accident, and he had evidently possessed an automobile driver\u2019s licence for about that length of time. He was married in Port Arthur in 1960 and it would seem that the trial judge was quite justified in concluding that he was familiar with the area. On at least two occasions, the late Mr. Sdraulig had called at the office of the North West Timber Company, south of the scene of the accident, but there is no evidence as to whether he had approached that timber company on Clavet Street or on one of the streets to the east or west of it. No matter which route he chose, the late Mr. Sdraulig would have had to have crossed this double track main line of the C.P.R. It must be noted that a southbound motorist on either Clavet Street, or the other streets to either side of it, would have an unobstructed view of the main line because they were the two northerly tracks and they were of course unoccupied by any standing box cars. Therefore, the late Mr. Sdraulig when he drove north across the five storage or shunting tracks must be taken to have known that ahead of him were the two main line tracks of the appellant company. Under those circumstances, therefore, he must be required to have exercised his ability to see what traffic was on the main line at the earliest possible moment. That earliest possible moment seems to be the time when his car was some 70 feet south of track No. 1 and at that moment, as I have said, his vision to the east-ward was only 118 feet 7 inches easterly along track No. 1.\nThe learned trial judge put the late Mr. Sdraulig\u2019s speed at 15 to 20 miles an hour. That was the estimate which had been set out in the written statement of one Campbell, to whom I have referred and who was one of the three eye witnesses of the accident. In Campbell\u2019s evidence at trial, he gave the speed at 15 and described the vehicle as moving very slowly. Guina, the engineer on the Canadian, described the speed of the late Mr. Sdraulig\u2019s car in these words: \u201cbut I would estimate it would be 12 to 15 miles per hour, a very normal rate of speed going across a crossing. It was rough and so forth\u201d. It must be understood that both Campbell and Guina could have only a very fleeting moment to judge the speed of the late Mr. Sdraulig\u2019s car. In fact, I cannot see how Campbell would have ever had any opportunity to observe the automobile. He swore that he was attracted by the sound of the whistle; the engineer swore that he sounded the whistle when his locomotive was within about 100 feet of the crossing or perhaps a little longer distance. If the locomotive were in that position, the train would be between Campbell whose position was at least 300 feet east of Clavet Street and the late Mr. Sdraulig\u2019s car cutting off his vision completely. The best summary would seem to be that the late Mr. Sdraulig\u2019s automobile was proceeding at about 15 miles an hour at the time it emerged into view of those who were looking at it from the east, particularly the engineer on the Canadian. If that vehicle were more than 70 feet from the crossing and if the late Mr. Sdraulig had immediately so soon as he was able observed the approaching Canadian on track No. 1 he could have brought his vehicle to a stop in something around 42 to 45 feet, i.e., 25 feet before he arrived at track No. 1. If, on the other hand, the late Mr. Sdraulig did not observe the approaching Canadian until he was level with the north side of the box cars standing on track No. 4, he was only at that time 36 feet away from track No. 1. At 15 miles an hour he would have covered that distance in 1.6 seconds and it was not said that his car decreased in speed before the impact nor were there any skid marks. It would, of course, have been impossible for the late Mr. Sdraulig to have stopped his car in that distance. It is, of course, perfectly plain and established by the authorities beyond any question that a motorist attempting to cross railway crossings must do so with caution and must take care to observe oncoming trains. The matter was put by Sir Louis Davies C.J., in this Court in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Smith[12], at p. 135 in these words:\nThe reasonable and salutary rule frequently laid down by the court with respect to persons crossing level railway crossings is that they must act as reasonable persons should act and not attempt to cross without looking for an approaching train to see whether they can safely cross. If they should choose recklessly and foolishly to run into danger, they must take the consequences.\nThe rule so requiring persons crossing railway tracks to look for a possible approaching train may not be an absolutely arbitrary one. Circumstances may exist which might excuse their not looking, but those circumstances must be such as would reasonably warrant a jury in finding they were excused from their duty in that regard.\nMiddleton J. in Blair v. Grand Trunk Railway Co.[13], said at p. 407:\nI should deplore the adoption of any fixed standard of care, such as \u201cstop, look, listen,\u201d but it is just as deplorable if an action will lie at the instance of a \u201cman who rushed, with his eyes open, to his own destruction.\u201d\nTwo factors, however, must be kept in mind in considering those and many other decisions; firstly, every case depends on the facts in the particular case and, secondly, those two decisions, and many others, were rendered before the enactment of what is now the Ontario Negligence Act. The application of that statute will permit a plaintiff to recover a proportion of his damages despite the fact that he himself, as well as the defendant railway, had been negligent: Reynolds v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.; Craig v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[14]; Flynn et al. v. C.P.R.; Kwapisz Estate v. C.P.R.[15]\nIt should also be noted that in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Smith, supra, and Blair v. Grand Trunk Railway Co., supra, the drivers of the vehicles were alive and able to give evidence as to their lookout or lack of lookout. In the present case, both Sdraulig and Babudro were killed instantly and we are only able to determine whether or not the driver looked for the train by making inferences from the course of the vehicle and from the presence of these obstructing empty standing box cars. After a careful review of all of the evidence, I have come to the conclusion that Sdraulig must be found to share a portion of the negligence which resulted in the accident, and I would find that the late Dante Sdraulig contributed 25 per cent of the negligence which caused the accident while the railway company contributed 75 per cent. I arrive at these percentages from a consideration of the salient fact that the view of the driver northbound on Clavet Street was so confined, particularly by the presence of the standing box car to the east of Clavet Street on track No. 4, that even at his earliest point of view he had a startling situation to face and that his failure to get his vehicle stopped had he observed the onrushing Canadian at this first possible moment was not such a fault as would justify a greater amount of negligence being assessed against him.\nThe late Ferruccio Babudro was a gratuitous passenger and therefore the provisions of s. 2(2) of The Negligence Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 261, applied to the claim by his administrator who should be able to recover only 75 per cent of the damages as found by the jury.\nTherefore, in the result, the appeals of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company should be allowed only to strike out the judgment of the Court of Appeal granting to the respondents a new trial but then the judgment of the learned trial judge should be varied to allow each of the plaintiffs Livia Sdraulig and Angelo Babudro to recover 75 per cent of the damages found by the jury in their actions. I would allow these respondents their costs of the trial and of the appeals to the Court of Appeal for Ontario; success being divided in this Court, I would make no order as to costs here.\nThe judgment of Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014These two actions under The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 138, result from a crossing accident in the City of Port Arthur when a northbound car was in collision with a westbound transcontinental train. Both driver and passenger were killed. At the trial the judge took from the jury the question of liability and left to them only the assessment of the damages. On appeal[16], the Court decided that the judge had improperly dismissed the jury as to liability. They ordered a new trial since, in their opinion, there was some evidence on which the jury might have found negligence on the part of the railway which caused or contributed to the accident.\nIn this Court, the railway, as appellant, contends that there was error in interfering with the discretionary decision of the trial judge to dispense with the jury on the question of liability; that the railway was not negligent; and that the sole cause of the accident was the negligence of the driver of the car.\nAs to the decision of the trial judge to dispense with the jury on the question of liability, in my opinion there was good reason why he did so. This was not a capricious exercise of the discretion, nor one founded on an erroneous decision on a matter of law. The assumption by the Court of Appeal of power to review this decision is in conflict with two decisions in this Court. Telford v. Secord; Telford v. Nasmith[17] and Mizinski v. Robillard and McLaughlin[18], are clear that the exercise of a trial judge\u2019s discretion to dispense with the jury is not a reviewable matter.\nThe accident happened on Clavet Street in the City of Port Arthur. Clavet Street runs north and south and seven tracks of the Canadian Pacific Railway run east and west. The tracks have been numbered from north to south and I will adhere to these numbers. The westbound transcontinental line is No. 1. The motorist was travelling north. He was struck on track No. 1 by the westbound passenger train.\nThere were no box cars standing on either tracks 1, 2 or 3. There was a string of box cars standing to the east of the crossing on track 4. The nearest of these cars was 47 feet east of the easterly limit of the crossing. These cars limited the easterly vision of the northbound motorist. From the southerly line of track 4, the visibility to the east was 231 feet. From the centre of track 4, the visibility was 398 feet to the east. On the north line of track 4, the visibility to the east was unlimited.\nThe crossing in its present form was duly authorized by orders of the Board of Railway Commissioners. The two northerly tracks were used for through traffic. The other tracks were for siding and switching. The trial judge found that the train was travelling at a normal speed between 35 and 40 miles per hour. It was within the Port Arthur yards and was approaching the Port Arthur station. Its bell was ringing and had been ringing for some distance east of the crossing. There was a by\u2011law of the City of Port Arthur passed under the authority of the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 234, prohibiting the sounding of the whistle at this crossing. The railway had erected and maintained at the crossing signboards bearing the words \u201cRailway Crossing\u20147 Tracks\u201d, as required by s. 270 of the Railway Act. These signs were plainly visible to motorists crossing in either direction.\nThere was no evidence that the railway company had failed in any manner to comply with the provisions of the Railway Act or any order of the Board of Transport Commissioners, and there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the passenger train crew, either by breach of statute or running orders or at common law.\nThe Court of Appeal recognized that the railway had complied with all applicable regulations and orders. Nevertheless, it held that the stationing of the box cars east of the crossing on track No. 4 could afford some evidence fit for submission to a jury that the accident was, at least in part, the result of a dangerous situation created by the defendants. With this conclusion I disagree.\nThe trial judge was of the opinion that the presence of the freight cars on track No. 4 could not be considered an exceptional danger or exceptional circumstances. The circumstances were ordinary and the operations usual. It must be remembered that this crossing was within the Port Arthur freight yards. This was a normal and every day use of these freight yards.\nThe only conclusion is that the motorist, in crossing, should have seen the oncoming train when he was on the north rail of track 4 and he should have been driving in such a way as to be able to stop.\nWe heard full argument on s. 103 of the Uniform Code of Operating Rules effective October 28, 1962, and in force at the time of the accident, which were fully approved and prescribed by the Board of Transport Commissioners. Section 103 reads:\n103...\nWhen necessary to cut trains at public crossings at grade, except where a member of the crew is to protect the crossing, or where other protec- tion is provided, cars or engines must not be left standing within 100 feet of the travelled portion of the public road.\n* * *\nBoth the trial judge and the Court of Appeal were in agreement that this section had no application. The apparent purpose of the section is to protect the public against movements of a live train which has been temporarily cut. The box cars on track No. 4 at the time of the accident did not constitute any part of a train as defined by the operating rules and there was no evidence at all that they had been placed in this position as a result of or during the cutting of a train at the Clavet Street crossing. Section 103 does not create a general rule that cars or engines must not be left standing within 100 feet of the travelled portion of the public road. This is only required when it is shown that it was the result of a cutting of a train at the particular crossing.\nThe standing box cars were, therefore, not on the tracks in breach of the Uniform Code of Operating Rules. Section 103 deals only with standing cars coming into position as a result of a certain operation. They must be 100 feet back. There is no general provision from the Board of Transport Commissioners dealing with other standing cars near level crossings. On the facts of this case, I think that the trial judge was right in concluding that box cars in this position on this track could not be evidence of a dangerous situation created by the railway. This Court in Alexander v. Toronto, Hamilton & Buffalo Ry. Co.[19], dealt with the doctrine of exceptional or special circumstances and it is one to be applied with great care. It has no application here.\nI would allow the appeals and restore the judgments at trial. The appellant is entitled to its costs both here and in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeals allowed and judgments at trial restored, with costs, CARTWRIGHT C.J. and SPENCE J. dissenting in part.\nSolicitors for the defendent, appellant: Weiler, Weiler & Maloney, Fort William.\nSolicitor for the plaintiffs, respondents: Alfred A.

The Exchequer Court upheld the Minister\u2019s assessment. The company appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe payments were payments of compensation for the termination of a separate business of the appellant. Therefore, the compensation received was a capital.\nEven if the mortgage business was not a business separate from its other activities, the cancellation of the agency contracts represented the loss of capital assets of an enduring nature the value of which has been built up over the years, and therefore the payments received by the appellant represented capital receipts.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t sur le revenu\u2014Fin d\u2019un contrat d\u2019agence d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ques\u2014L\u2019indemnit\u00e9 re\u00e7ue est-elle un revenu ou un capital\u2014Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148, art. 8, 4.\nLa compagnie appelante exer\u00e7ait un commerce d\u2019immeubles, et, durant plusieurs ann\u00e9es avant 1963, elle exer\u00e7ait aussi un commerce d\u2019hypoth\u00e8ques dans l\u2019un des cinq services dans lesquels elle avait r\u00e9parti toute son entreprise.

Appel accueilli.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Sheppard D.J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in an income tax matter. Appeal allowed.\nP.N. Thorsteinsson, for the appellant.\nG.W. Ainslie, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSPENCE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice Sheppard, District Judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, delivered on October 28, 1968. By that judgment, the learned trial judge dismissed the appeal of the taxpayer H.A. Roberts Limited from the assessment by the Minister of National Revenue made in connection with the appellant\u2019s 1963 taxation year, and confirmed the allocation of two sums received by the appellant in that year, i.e., $73,633.72 from the Crown Life Insurance Company, and $10,000 from Burrard Mortgage Investments Limited, to income. It is necessary to outline the circumstances in some detail.\nH.A. Roberts had been engaged in the real estate business for some time. On April 2, 1929, H.A. Roberts Limited was incorporated as a private company by Memorandum of Association under the British Columbia Companies Act. The taxpayer carried on as a real estate company for a considerable number of years. During that period, the company, as any other real estate dealer, was called upon from time to time to obtain mortgages for purchasers of real estate through it and to loan funds of its customers on mortgages. In the year 1946, the appellant was appointed mortgage representative in British Columbia for the Crown Life Insurance Company. At the time of that first appointment, the appellant was not the sole agent for the said insurance company in British Columbia but from and after the 7th of June 1948 the appellant occupied such sole and exclusive agency. For the appellant\u2019s services to the Crown Life it was entitled to receive 10 per cent of the interest collected for the company up to $100,000 and 7\u00bd per cent on interest collected above that amount. Thereafter, the appellant organized its business in departments as follows:\n1. Real Estate.\n2. Mortgages.\n3. Insurance.\n4. Property Management.\n5. Appraisals.\nIn the year 1964, i.e., after the taxation year with which this appeal is concerned, it added another department, that of Property Development. In the year 1953, the appellant had built its own building at 530 Burrard Street, Vancouver, B.C. On the ground floor of that building, it established the offices for the various departments other than the mortgage department; the second floor of the building was occupied in whole by the mortgage department. That department was staffed by from ten to thirteen persons and had as its head a manager. The department was operated as an altogether separate entity from the other kinds of businesses which the taxpayer carried on and it was made very specific that those in other departments were not entitled to obtain information from those employed in the mortgage department. That department, in addition to handling the Crown Life agency, took on other similar mortgage agencies. By an agreement made on August 1, 1960, it became the sole and exclusive agent in British Columbia for Burrard Mortgage Investments Limited and carried on as to second mortgages much the same business for Burrard as it was carrying on as to first mortgages for Crown Life. In addition, a company known as Abernathy Mortgage Corporation held an exclusive agency for the Occidental Life Insurance Company of California. The appellant purchased all the shares in the Abernathy Mortgage Corporation and as a result entered into an agency contract with the Occidental Life Insurance Company of California dated June 30, 1959. Mr. J.P. Roberts, giving evidence on behalf of the appellant, testified that with the ever increasing amount of the appellant\u2019s business being involved in the mortgage department and by far the greatest share of such business being that of the Crown Life Insurance Company, in the year 1960, he began to be concerned lest termination of that agency would result in a heavy loss to his company. The original agreement in the year 1946, and the subsequent amendments thereafter, had been carried out by letter and such agreements had contained no provision for termination. It would appear, therefore, that the agency could have been terminated on reasonable notice.\nMr. Roberts testified that he conferred with Mr. Jamie-son, the mortgage superintendent of the Crown Life upon the topic. Mr. Jamieson was approaching retirement age and one of the motives moving Mr. Roberts to obtain an exact provision as to what would occur were the agency to be terminated was that the excellent relationship between him and Mr. Jamieson would not necessarily be continued with the latter\u2019s successor. Mr. Jamieson readily agreed that some compensation would be due to the appellant upon termination and as a result under date the 24th of February 1960, Mr. Jamieson, for the Crown Life Insurance Company, wrote to Mr. Roberts, for the appellant, outlining the new terms of the agency agreement. The commission upon interest collected was reduced from 7\u00bd per cent to 6 per cent and it was specifically provided that\nthe Crown Life Insurance Company shall have the right to discontinue the servicing portions of the agreement without cause on ninety (90) days\u2019 written notice to H.A. Roberts Limited upon payment to H.A. Roberts Limited of one-half of one per cent. (\u00bd%) of the then unpaid balance of the mortgages being serviced by H.A. Roberts Limited for the Crown Life Insurance Company.\nThe appellant continued to operate in the same fashion under those terms. By the year 1962, the appellant was servicing as agent a mortgage portfolio for the Crown Life Insurance Company of almost $15,000,000 in outstanding principal amounts, a mortgage portfolio for Burrard Mortgage Investments of about $2,000,000 outstanding principal, and a mortgage portfolio in the Occidental Life Insurance Company of California of about the same $2,000,000 figure. The appellant had, in addition, a very few independent clients for whom it operated as mortgage agents and this small amount of business was, for the sake of finance and efficiency, turned into a mortgage department. The appellant had completely set up its accounting and reporting system to comply with the requirements of the Crown Life and Burrard Mortgage Investments, and particularly the former. The appellant had purchased an accounting machine at the cost of $6,000 for such purpose.\nIn the year 1962, the Crown Life Insurance Company, having built its own office building in Vancouver and having usable space therein, determined to establish its own mortgage department for British Columbia in such building and to terminate the agency held by the appellant. Therefore, on September 28, 1962, the Crown Life Insurance Company, over the signature of its vice-president and superintendent of mortgages, gave notice to the appellant in these terms:\nPursuant to our letter to you of February 24th, 1960, we beg to give you formal notice of discontinuance of our agreement with you as of February 1st, 1963.\nIt will be seen that that notification was a little longer than that required by the letter of September 24, 1960. Thereafter, the Crown Life Insurance Company paid to the appellant the sum of $73,633.72, being one-half of one per cent of the principal value of Crown Life mortgages then in force in British Columbia which amount was $14,726,744. Upon that occurrence, the manager of the mortgage department of the appellant came to the conclusion that there was no future in remaining in that position. He was, at the same time, one of the controlling officers of the Burrard Mortgage Investments Limited and, therefore, he caused Burrard also to cancel its agency agreement. Under the agreement with Burrard, the latter was entitled to cancel the agreement without cause on ninety days\u2019 written notice and on the payment of the sum of $20,000. Burrard, however, objected to the accounting which had been made to it by the appellant and on solicitors\u2019 advice, to avoid litigation, the appellant accepted from Burrard the sum of $10,000 in settlement, and mutual releases were executed. It is these two sums of $73,633.72 and $10,000 which the Minister has put into income which the appellant submits should be regarded as capital receipts and, therefore, not subject to income tax. At the time the Crown Life Insurance Company terminated its agreement and established its own mortgage department in British Columbia, eight or nine of the employees of the appellant\u2019s mortgage department left the appellant\u2019s service and became employees of Crown Life\u2019s mortgage department in British Columbia. At roughly the same time, the Occidental Life Insurance Company of California cancelled its agency agreement and by an arrangement made between the appellant and the Occidental Life the agency business was transferred to another agent known as MacAulay Nichols, with that agency agreeing to pay to the appellant 25 per cent of the commissions it obtained. Amounts received under that agreement have been credited to income and we are not concerned with them in this appeal. One of the employees of the appellant\u2019s mortgage department went to MacAulay Nichols. The manager of the department and two more of the staff became employees of Burrard Investments Limited, and one retired.\nIt will be seen, therefore, that the appellant lost the complete staff of its mortgage department. The appellant moved its other departments into the second floor of the building previously occupied by that mortgage department, which it discontinued, and let out to tenants the ground floor which it had previously occupied with those other departments. Some attempts were made to obtain other correspondence agency contracts with other insurance companies but Mr. Roberts\u2019 evidence was that such attempts were, at best, half-hearted. He pointed out that having lost all his staff, he would have to, even if he were fortunate enough to obtain an agency, which he did not consider a possibility, have \u201cstarted from scratch\u201d. It appears that the only possible market was in U.S. insurance companies and at that time the demand for mortgages in the U.S. was such that they were not interested in entering the mortgage field in British Columbia.\nWith the proceeds of the payments by Crown Life and Burrard Investments, the appellant purchased two different insurance agencies known as George Barker Agency and the Day Ross Roberts Agency. The amounts paid out, totalling $72,500, were treated as capital items. The payments for the shares of the Abernathy Mortgage Company, to which I have referred above, were treated in the same fashion as capital outlay. Mr. Roberts testified that he had never sold an agency.\nThe appellant made its submission to this Court upon two bases. Firstly, that the mortgage correspondency business carried on by the appellant was a distinct business separate from its other activities and that the cancellation by the Crown Life Mortgage and Burrard Mortgage Investments effectively brought that business to an end and therefore compensation received therefor was a capital receipt to the appellant. Secondly, the appellant urged, in the alternative, that the loss of the Crown Life and Burrard Mortgage agency contracts represented the loss of capital assets of an enduring nature, the value of which had been built up over the years so that payment received by the appellant for such a loss was a capital receipt.\nThe trial judge, in his reasons for judgment, concluded:\nAfter the cancellation the Mortgage Department was closed and the staff disbanded, the majority of them being absorbed by the Crown Life and the individual mortgagees who were customers of the appellant were serviced by the Accounting Department of the appellant. Therefore, while the Mortgage Department was a separate department, it was not a separate business.\nThis Court had occasion, in Frankel Corporation v. M.N.R.[2], to consider a related question. The Frankel Corporation Limited, as did the present appellant, had carried on under one corporate structure a variety of businesses including, (1) a steel operation, (2) a wreckage and salvage operation, (3) a scrap iron and steel operation, and (4) a non-ferrous smelting and refining operation. The Frankel Corporation sold its non-ferrous smelting and refining operation including the inventory at hand. Frankel alleged that this sale of inventory was part of the sale of a business and was not a sale in the ordinary course of the company\u2019s business so that the proceeds from such sale should not be considered part of the company\u2019s income. It is true that the actual decision of this Court was that the sale of the inventory was not a sale in the ordinary course of business, but in order to come to that conclusion the Court had to hold that the subject of the contract between the Frankel Corporation and the purchaser was the sale of a business despite the fact that that business was not the subject of any separate incorporation. Martland J., giving the judgment of the Court, quoted extensively the judgment of the trial judge in the Exchequer Court of Canada and then stated, \u201cI agree with these conclusions\u201d.\nThe learned trial judge in the Exchequer Court had regard for such circumstances as the source of the material and supplies used in the operation, the employees of Frankel who bought the material and supplies, the machinery and equipment used in the operation, the employees who operated such machinery, the portion of the premises where the operation was carried on, the customers who bought the products, the employees of Frankel who sold those products, the name under which the operation was carried on, and the trade-mark and trade name used on the products. He said, in part:\nIndeed, the whole process by which profit was earned seems to have been quite distinct from the others, save in respect of the acquisition of minor quantities of scrap material from the wrecking and salvage operation, the combination for some purposes of the accounting with that of the ferrous scrap operation and such general matters as control by the same board of directors, the arrangement of a single union contract for employees of the appellant, employees\u2019 pension and insurance plans, and the ultimate preparation of the profit and loss account for the operations of the company.\nIn my view, the separation of the mortgage department of the appellant was at least as distinct and probably much more distinct than the separation of the non-ferrous smelting and refining department of the Frankel Corporation. The employees worked in a distinct premises, under a manager of that department only, the method of accounting was set up especially for that department, the mortgages issued on behalf of the Crown Life and Burrard were issued very generally to others than the customers of the appellant and because of the necessity of keeping confidential such customers\u2019 affairs the employees of the mortgage department were expressly prohibited from giving any other department in the appellant company information as to the affairs of those other customers. The only control of the mortgage department by anyone other than the staff thereof was by the directors of the company and, of course, it is the duty of the directors to control all departments, one may say, the different businesses, of the company. I have come to the conclusion that, applying the decision of this Court in Frankel Corporation v. M.N.R., it should be determined that the payments by the Crown Life Insurance Company and Burrard Mortgage Investments Limited were payments of compensation for the termination of a separate business of the appellant. Therefore, under Van Den Berghs v. Clark (H.M. Inspector of Taxes)[3] and Barr, Crombie & Co. Ltd. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue,[4] the compensation received is capital and cannot be assigned to the appellant\u2019s income for the year 1963.\nI turn to consider the appellant\u2019s alternative submission.\nEven if the mortgage correspondency business carried on by the appellant was not a distinctive business separate from its other activities, the loss of the Crown Life and Burrard Mortgage contracts represented \u201cthe loss of capital assets of an enduring nature, the value of which had been built up over the years\u201d so that the payment received by the appellant for the loss thereof represented a capital receipt.\nAs was said by Lord Evershed in Wiseburgh v. Domville[5], when referring to the distinction between the case where such payments are to be considered as capital receipts or, on the other hand, as income:\nBut, the matter being largely one of degree and so of fact, as Lord Normand said, I think the question is one of fact for the commissioners to find.\nThe same view was expressed by Lord Normand (the Lord President) in Kelsall Parsons & Co. v. Inland Revenue[6]:\n\u2026 no infallible criterion emerges from a consideration of the case law. Each case depends upon its own facts\u2026\nAgain, as Lord Evershed pointed out in Wiseburgh v. Domville, supra, Kelsall Parsons & Co. v. Inland Revenue was very much at one end of the line and Barr, Crombie v. Inland Revenue[7] very much at the other. In the Kelsall case, the taxpayer had some sixteen agencies, and only one of them was cancelled. It was held that under such circumstances the obtaining of an agency or the cancellation of an agency was very much in the course of business and that therefore any compensation paid for such cancellations would be part of the ordinary income of the taxpayer. On the other hand, in Barr, Crombie v. Inland Revenue, the company had a contract to manage the ships of the Barr Shipping Company Limited and from the beginning of its existence the taxpayer continued to act as manager for the shipping company receiving commissions and fees under a variety of headings. The contract was to run until 1951 and it provided that if the shipping company went into liquidation the remuneration to be paid to Barr, Crombie should become immediately due and payable. In November 1948, eight and a half years before the expiry of the agreement, the shipping company went into liquidation and had paid to the taxpayer \u00a316,000 under the said article of the agreement. Lord Normand (the Lord President) pointed out at p. 412:\nAnd where you have a payment for the loss of the contract upon which the whole trade of the company had been built\u2026 and where in consequence of the loss the Company\u2019s structure and character are greatly affected, the payment seems to me to be beyond doubt a capital payment.\nThe payment was held to be a capital receipt not subject to income tax.\nIn Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Fleming & Co. (Machinery) Ltd.[8], Lord Russell said at p. 63:\nThe sum received by a commercial firm as compensation for the loss sustained by the cancellation of a trading contract or the premature termination of an agency agreement may in the recipient\u2019s hands be regarded either as a capital receipt or as a trading receipt forming part of the trading profit. It may be difficult to formulate a general principle by reference to which in all cases the correct decision will be arrived at since in each case the question comes to be one of circumstance and degree. When the rights and advantages surrendered on cancellation are such as to destroy or materially to cripple the whole structure of the recipient\u2019s profit-making apparatus, involving the serious dislocation of the normal commercial organisation and resulting perhaps in the cutting down of the staff previously required, the recipient of the compensation may properly affirm that the compensation represents the price paid for the loss or sterilisation of a capital asset and is therefore a capital and not a revenue receipt. Illustrations of such cases are to be found in Van den Berghs, Ltd., 19 T.C. 390, [1935] A.C. 431, and Barr, Crombie & Co. Ltd., 26 T.C. 406, 1945 S.C. 271. On the other hand when the benefit surrendered on cancellation does not represent the loss of an enduring asset in circumstances such as those above mentioned\u2014where for example the structure of the recipient\u2019s business is so fashioned as to absorb the shock as one of the normal incidents to be looked for and where it appears that the compensation received is no more than a surrogatum for the future profits surrendered\u2014the compensation received is in use to be treated as a revenue receipt and not a capital receipt. See e.g. Short Brothers, Ltd., 12 T.C. 955; Kelsall Parsons & Co., 21 T.C. 608.\nMr. Justice Thurlow in the Exchequer Court in Parsons-Steiner Limited v. Minister of National Revenue[9], considered these authorities and others in application to the following circumstances:\nThe taxpayer had, for many years, a contract with Doulton & Co. Ltd. of England whereby it acted as the exclusive agency in Canada for that company. The contract was, in the beginning, for one year definite, and was to continue thereafter until determined by three months\u2019 notice which might be given by either party. In 1954 the contract was determined effective at the end of 1955, and the parties negotiated a compensation of $100,000. It was agreed that $5,000 of that amount was applicable to the services performed by the taxpayer in the transfer of the agency business from it to Doulton\u2019s newly-created Canadian company, and it was admitted therefore that that sum fell into income. Thurlow J. held that the balance was a capital receipt. On the termination of the agency, two of the taxpayer\u2019s seventeen employees had transferred to Doulton\u2019s new company and in order to counter the expected drop in sales the taxpayer had employed several new salesmen and made a greater effort to augment sales of lines which it still carried. There were no changes in the premises occupied by the taxpayer and no salaries were cut as a result of the loss of the Doulton agency. One new agency was obtained but no agency could be obtained which would supply figurines comparable to the very well-known Doulton line. In the negotiations for the settlement of the compensation which Doulton would pay to the taxpayer the president of the taxpayer wrote a letter to Doulton one paragraph of which was as follows:\nAt this point in our calculation, we stopped and gave thoughtful consideration to the matter of how much of the successful development of the Doulton market in Canada has been a joint effort, in the sense that you as manufacturers had created an acceptable product, and that we have done a fine job of establishing and servicing a distribution organization which you can be proud to take over without modification. Thurlow J. at p. 187, said:\nOn the whole therefore having regard to the importance of the Doulton agency in the appellant\u2019s business, the length of time the relationship had subsisted, the extent to which the appellant\u2019s business was affected by its loss both in decreased sales and by reason of its inability to replace it with anything equivalent, to the fact that two of the appellant\u2019s employees became employees of the Doulton subsidiary on the termination of the relationship and the fact that from that time the appellant was in fact out of that part of its business, both as an agent and as a wholesale dealer, and particularly to the nature of the claim asserted in respect of which the payment was made, I am of the opinion that, except in so far as it was a consideration for services rendered to Doulton & Co. Limited, in connection with the take-over by its subsidiary, which is admitted to be income, and except in so far as it took the place of commissions on sales of goods ordered before, but invoiced after December 31, 1955, the payment in question was not income from the appellant\u2019s business, but was referable to the appellant\u2019s claim for loss of what it and Doulton Co. Limited as well considered to be the appellant\u2019s interest in the goodwill and business in Doulton products in Canada. In my view this was, to use Lord Evershed\u2019s expression, \u201cA capital asset of an enduring nature\u201d. It was one which the appellant had built up over the years in which it had the Doulton agency and which on the termination of the agency the appellant was obliged to relinquish. The payment received in respect of its loss was accordingly a capital receipt.\nIn the present case, the cancellation of the two agencies, that of the Crown Life Insurance Company and Burrard Mortgage Investments Limited, did make a very distinct impact on the appellant\u2019s business. They were two out of the three such agencies which made possible the operation of the appellant\u2019s mortgage department. The loss of those agencies, as I have said, caused the mortgage department to simply cease to exist. The net income of the mortgage department, before general and administration expenses are considered, ranged from 27.6 per cent in 1958 to 51 per cent in 1961 of the whole net income of the taxpayer\u2019s business. In the fiscal year 1963, when the Crown Life agency was only in effect for ten months of the twelve, that percentage was 39 per cent.\nRealizing therefore that the determination is one of degree, it would seem to me that the cancellation of the two correspondency agency contracts would fall into the line of cases illustrated by the Barr, Crombie case and the Parsons-Steiner case, and it would not be simply an example of the cancellation of one of a number of agencies as in Kelsall Parsons & Co. v. Inland Revenue, supra.\nSubstituting insurance agency vocabulary for mercantile agency vocabulary, I am of the opinion that the quota- tion above from the letter written by Parsons-Steiner to Doulton & Co. Ltd. could be applied to the situation between this taxpayer and the Crown Life and Burrard Mortgage Investments.\nThe learned trial judge distinguished the Parsons-Steiner ease from the present one on the grounds that in such case the taxpayer possessed an exclusive agency which was cancelled. In the present case the Crown Life agency was exclusive and I can see no difference in principle between an agency to sell china and one to solicit mortgages and manage them. The learned trial judge also pointed out that in the Parsons-Steiner case the compensation was negotiated while here the exact compensation paid was prescribed for in the agreement. Again, I cannot find such a circumstance decisive. In this case in 1960 the taxpayer realizing that it was building up a capital asset desired to assure that it would endure or that proper compensation would be paid for its loss and negotiated an exact provision for that compensation agreeing to a reduction of its income for the purpose of securing such compensation for loss of the capital asset. The payment of such prefixed compensation is no less a payment for a capital loss than a payment for such loss after negotiation at the time when it occurs. Finally, counsel for the Minister, if we were of the opinion that the Parsons\u2011Steiner case was undistinguishable, invited us to hold it was badly decided and refuse to accept it. I am not willing to do so. With respect, I am of the opinion that Thurlow J. in Parsons-Steiner came to the correct conclusion after a careful and accurate analysis of the case law and the principles involved.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the cancellation of these two agency contracts did represent the loss of capital assets of an enduring nature the value of which had been built up over the years and that therefore the payments received by this appellant represented capital receipts. For both of these reasons, I would allow the appeal with costs here and below and direct that the assessment for the 1963 taxation year be returned to the Minister of National Revenue for revision in accordance with these reasons.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Thorsteinsson, Mitchell & Little, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

At that time, he owned all the shares of a company incorporated in Saskatchewan. In 1958, he moved from Saskatchewan to Ontario and took the company\u2019s shareholders register with him. Neither the Companies Act of Saskatchewan nor the articles of association of the company authorized the keeping of a register anywhere except in the province of Saskatchewan. The executors of the estate contended that the shares were to be treated as having a situs in Ontario and that the estate was therefore entitled to a provincial tax deduction under s. 9(1) of the Estate Tax Act, 1958 (Can.), c. 29. Alternatively, the executors contended that if their situs could not be identified with reasonable certainty, that the shares were deemed to be situated in Ontario in accordance with the provisions of s. 9(8)(e) of the Act. The Exchequer Court upheld the Minister\u2019s contention that the shares were situated in Saskatchewan and that the estate was not entitled to the deduction. The executors appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe situs of a company\u2019s shares is at the place where its share register is required by law to be kept and the physical presence of the register in another jurisdiction has no effect upon the matter. (Erie Beach Co., Ltd. v. A.G. for Ontario, [1930] A.C. 161). The word \u201cmaintained\u201d as used in s. 9(8)(d)(i) of the Estate Tax Act must be construed as meaning \u201cmaintained\u201d in accordance with the requirements of the statute under which the company was incorporated, and in the present case this must mean in the province of Saskatchewan.\nRevenu\u2014Imp\u00f4t successoral\u2014Cr\u00e9dit pour taxes provinciales\u2014Situs des actions d\u2019une compagnie\u2014D\u00e9funt domicili\u00e9 en Ontario, une province prescrite\u2014Compagnie constitu\u00e9e en Saskatchewan, une province non prescrite\u2014Registre des actionnaires apport\u00e9 dans la province prescrite\u2014 Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur les biens transmis par d\u00e9c\u00e8s, 1958 (Can.), c. 29, art. 9(1), 9(8)(d), (e)\u2014The Companies Act, S.R.S. 1955, c. 124, art. 76(1), 77, 78a.\nLors de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s en 1965, le de cujus r\u00e9sidait et \u00e9tait domicili\u00e9 en Ontario.

Appel rejet\u00e9.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Jackett P. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, in an estate tax matter. Appeal dismissed.\nGordon W. Ford, Q.C., for the appellants.\nF.J. Dubrule and M.J. Bonner, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought by the Executors of the Estate of Harry M. Schiller, from a judgment rendered by President Jackett of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2], whereby he confirmed the assessment made by the Minister of National Revenue under the Estate Tax Act in relation to the shares held by the late Mr. Schiller in Schiller\u2019s Limited, a company incorporated under The Companies Act, of Saskatchewan.\nThe following portions of The Companies Act, R.S.S. 1955, c. 124 as amended by c. 18 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan 1956, appear to me to be particularly relevant:\n76. (1) Every company shall keep in one or more books a register of its members, and shall enter therein the names of the subscribers to the memorandum and the name of every other person who agrees to become a member of the company, together with the following particulars:\n(a) the full name, address and occupation of every such subscriber and person, and of every person to whom section 91 or 92 applies, and who requests the company to enter his name in a representative capacity;\n(b) the date at which each person was entered in the register as a member;\n(c) the date at which any person ceased to be a member;\n(d) the kind and class of the shares held by each member, their nominal amount or par value, if any, and the amount paid or agreed to be considered as paid on each share;\n(e) particulars of the transfer by any member of his shares;\n(f) in the case of a person to whom section 91 or 92 applies, a description of the capacity in which such person represents any share in the company so held by him, and the name of the estate or person so represented.\n77. On the application of the transferor of any share in a company, the company shall enter in its register of members the name of the transferee in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as if the application for the entry were made by the transferee.\nSection 78a\n78a The register of members shall be kept at the registered office of the company; provided that the register may be kept at an office in the province of a trust company licensed under The Companies Inspection and Licensing Act, and so long as the register is so kept the trust company shall be subject to the provisions of this Act respecting the register in the same manner and to the same extent as if the register were kept at the registered office of the company, but the trust company shall under no circumstances be entitled to a lien on the register.\nThe Company in question was incorporated on May 26, 1927. By its Memorandum of Association it was provided that the registered office was to be situate at the City of Regina in the Province of Saskatchewan and no provision was ever made, either in the Company\u2019s Articles of Association or otherwise for any other registered office or branch registry. From the time of its incorporation until the date of his death, the late Mr. Schiller owned or controlled all the issued common shares of the Company; he was its president and exercised the full degree of control and management consequent upon his ownership of the shares and his office as president. Until March, 1953, Mr. Schiller resided in the City of Regina where he was domiciled and where the business of the Company was conducted, but from that date until his death he became resident and domiciled in the City of Toronto to which City he removed the Minute Book, Share Register Book and Shareholders\u2019 Register of the Company, and where he conducted all its affairs, although the Company continued to file annual returns as required by The Companies Act of Saskatchewan wherein it reported the address of its \u201cRegistered Office\u201d as being 1702 Hamilton Street in the City of Regina, which was a building owned by it.\nIt is agreed between the parties that the Province of Ontario is a \u201cprescribed Province\u201d within the meaning of s. 9 of the Estate Tax Act, whereas Saskatchewan is not such a Province.\nUnder the provisions of s. 9(1) of the Estate Tax Act provision is made for the deduction from the tax otherwise payable upon the aggregate taxable value of property passing on the death of a person:\n9.(1)(a) in the case of a person who was domiciled in a prescribed province at the time of his death,\n(i) the part of the tax otherwise payable that is applicable to\n(A) such of the property passing on the death of that person as was situated in that or any other prescribed province, and\u2026\nmultiplied by\n(ii) one-half;\u2026\nThe italics are my own.\nThe fact that this deduction would be properly applicable to the late Mr. Schiller\u2019s shares in the company if they had a situs in the Province of Ontario and would have no application if they were to be treated as having a situs in Saskatchewan, gives rise to the objection here taken by the Schiller estate.\nIn the present case the Minister has determined that the shares in question are situate in Saskatchewan and that the estate of the deceased is therefore not entitled to the deduc- tion provided under s. 9(1); whereas the appellants contend that as all the Company\u2019s documents, including its Register of Shares, were physically situate in Ontario where the deceased was domiciled at the time of his death, they are to be treated as having a situs in that Province and that the estate is accordingly entitled to a deduction under s. 9(1)(a)(i) (A) or in the alternative that if their situs cannot be identified with reasonable certainty, that the shares are deemed to be situate in Ontario in accordance with the provisions of s. 9(8)(e) of the Estate Tax Act.\nSection 9(8) of the Estate Tax Act provides statutory rules for determining the situs of shares passing on the death of a person, and the relevant portions of s. 9(8)(d) and (e) read as follows:\n(d) shares, stocks and debenture stocks of a corporation and rights to subscribe for or purchase shares or stocks of a corporation (including any such property held by a nominee, whether the beneficial ownership is evidenced by scrip certificates or otherwise) shall be deemed to be situated\n(i) in the province where the deceased was domiciled at the time of his death if any register of transfers or place of transfer is maintained by the corporation in that province for the transfer thereof, and\n(ii) otherwise,\n(A) in the nearest province, relative to the province where the deceased was domiciled at the time of his death, that is not a prescribed province and in which any register of transfers or place of transfer is maintained by the corporation for the transfer thereof,\u2026\n(e) property for which no specific provision is made in any other paragraph of this subsection, or the situs of which, determined as provided therein, cannot with reasonable certainty be identified, shall be deemed to be situated in the place where the deceased was domiciled at the time of his death;\u2026\nIt is agreed between the parties that at the time of Mr. Schiller\u2019s death the Share Register of the Company was physically situate in Toronto where entries were made in it from time to time as appears therein, but neither The Companies Act of Saskatchewan nor the Articles of Association of the Company authorized it to keep a Register of Members or a branch Register of Members anywhere except in the Province of Saskatchewan, and the whole question raised by this appeal is whether, notwithstanding the provisions of the Saskatchewan Companies Act requiring the Register of Members of a company to be kept in that Province, the fact that such Register was kept in the Province of Ontario at the time of Mr. Schiller\u2019s death, had the effect of giving the Company\u2019s shares a situs in the Province of Ontario within the meaning of s. 9(8)(d) of the Estate Tax Act. In my view this case is governed by the direct authority of the decision of the Privy Council in Erie Beach Company, Limited v. The Attorney-General for Ontario[3]. In that case the question for determination was whether the shares of a company incorporated under the Ontario Companies Act were situate in the Province of Ontario or the State of New York for succession duty purposes. Under the Ontario Companies Act (R.S.O. 1914, c. 178) companies incorporated under that statute were required to keep a Register of Shares and Shareholders at the head office \u201cwithin Ontario\u201d, but Mr. Bardol, who owned or controlled all the shares in the company, managed his business from his office in Buffalo, New York, where the books, records and documents of the company were kept, and such transfers as took place were made and recorded. In delivering the judgment on behalf of the Privy Council, Lord Merrivale said:\nIn Attorney-General v. Higgins 1914 A.C. 176, as in Brassard v. Smith, 1925 A.C. 371, duty upon shares was in question. In Attorney-General v. Higgins, supra, Baron Martin held that when transfer of shares in a company must be effected by a change in the register, the place where the register is required by law to be kept determines the locality of the shares. Lord Dunedin, in delivering the judgment of this Board in Brassard v. Smith, epitomized the crucial inquiry in a sentence\u2014\u2018Where could the shares be effectually dealt with?\u2019 The circumstances relied upon by the appellants which show the predilection of the members of the plaintiff company for transacting its business in Buffalo\u2014so far as they might\u2014have, in their Lordships\u2019 opinion, no material weight. The shares in question can be effectually dealt with in Ontario only. They are therefore property situate in Ontario and subject to succession duty there.\nI take this to be authority for the proposition that the situs of a company\u2019s shares is at the place where its share register is required to be kept by law and that the physical presence of the share register in another jurisdiction has no effect upon the matter. I am accordingly of opinion that the words \u201c\u2026if any register of transfers or place of transfer is maintained by the corporation in that province\u2026\u201d as they are used in s. 9(8)(d)(i) of the Estate Tax Act must be construed as meaning \u201cmaintained\u201d in accordance with the requirements of the statute under which the company in question was incorporated and that in the present case this must mean in the Province of Saskatchewan.\nThe learned President of the Exchequer Court has written careful reasons for judgment in which he has concluded that for the purpose of the Estate Tax Act the shares of Schiller\u2019s Limited are deemed to be situate in Saskatchewan at the date of Mr. Harry Schiller\u2019s death in accordance with the provisions of s. 9(8)(d). I am in agreement with this conclusion and would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: B.M. Singer, Toronto,\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S.

The contract was subject to the condi- tion of the \u201cpurchaser being able to purchase\u201d an adjacent lot. The action was dismissed at trial on the ground that the purchaser had failed to prove performance of a condition precedent. The Court of Appeal reversed this decision and decreed specific performance. They held that the condition was a stipulation simply and solely for the benefit of the purchaser, that the purchaser might waive performance of the condition and that it was entitled to specific performance of the contract. The vendor appealed from the judgment of the Court of Appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nWhen there is a stipulation or term in a contract non-fulfilment of which would render the contract incomplete and hence unenforceable, but which is for the benefit of the purchaser and severable, then the purchaser is entitled to waive it in order to be able to obtain a decree of specific performance. However, this is far removed from the case where the agreement is subject to a condition precedent. The vendor in the present appeal had no enforceable contract without performance of the condition. Neither had the purchaser. With the consent of the vendor, he could have introduced a term permitting him to waive the condition.\nThe case throughout was argued on the narrow ground of non-performance of the condition. If it had been pleaded and proved that performance of the condition precedent had been prevented by the act of the vendor, the result here might have been different.\nTurney v.

Studd & Millington, [1913] 2 Ch 648, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing a decision of Wootton J. dismissing an action for specific performance of a contract for the sale of land. Appeal allowed and judgment at trial restored.\nJ.S. de Villiers, for the defendants, appellants.\nA.N. Patterson, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014Marketers Diversified Inc. sued John Windham O\u2019Reilly, in his personal capacity and as executor of the Will of Mary Beresford O\u2019Reilly, for specific performance of an agreement to sell Lot 7, James Bay, Prevost Island, Cowichan District, British Columbia. The contract was subject to the following condition:\nPurchaser being able to purchase Lot No. 8 (described as adjacent to Lot 7, James Bay, Prevost Island,) owned by Mr. DeBerg on terms and conditions satisfactory to purchaser prior to September 1, 1966. The action was dismissed at trial on the ground that the purchaser had failed to prove performance of a condition precedent. The Court of Appeal[2] reversed this decision and decreed specific performance. They held that the condition was a stipulation simply and solely for the benefit of the purchaser, that the purchaser might waive performance of the condition and that it was entitled to specific performance of the contract.\nI would allow the appeal and dismiss the action.\nThe judgment under appeal is in direct conflict with two judgments of this Court: Turney v. Zhilka[3], and F.T. Developments Ltd. v. Sherman[4]. It is insecurely founded upon a passage in Fry on Specific Performance, 6th ed., p. 175:\nWhere a contract contains stipulations which are simply and solely for the benefit of the purchaser, and are severable, the purchaser may waive them, and obtain judgment for specific performance of the rest of the contract.\nThe passage is supported by the authority of two cases: Hawksley v. Outram[5] and Morrell v. Studd & Millington[6]. But they are not authority for the proposition that a condition precedent may be waived unilaterally. They are illustrations of the principle that a plaintiff, seeking specific performance of a contract, may elect to take less than the promised performance from the other side. In the one case it was the right to use the name of the vendor partnership; in the other, it was the right to security for the unpaid balance of the purchase price. This was explained in Turney v. Zhilka.\nIn the chapter from which this passage was taken, the learned author was dealing with the subject of incompleteness of the contract. He had this to say:\n368. (iv) It is of course essential to the completeness of the contract that it should express not only the names of the parties, the subject-matter, and the price, but all the other material terms. What are, in each case, the material terms of a contract, and how far it must descend into details to prevent its being void as incomplete and uncertain, are questions, which must of course be determined by a consideration of each contract separately. It may, however, be laid down that the Court will carry into effect a contract framed in general terms, where the law will supply the details; but if any details are to be supplied in modes which cannot be adopted by the Court, there is then no concluded contract capable of being enforced. In the passage relied upon as the foundation for the judgment of the Court of Appeal the learned author is saying that when there is a stipulation or term in a contract non-fulfilment of which would render the contract incomplete and hence unenforceable, but which is for the benefit of the purchaser and severable, then the purchaser is entitled to waive it in order to be able to obtain a decree of specific performance. The authorities quoted and reviewed in Zhilka support this proposition. However, this is far removed from the case where the agreement is subject to a condition precedent.\nThe vendor in the present appeal had no enforceable contract without performance of the condition. Neither had the purchaser. With the consent of the vendor, he could have introduced a term permitting him to waive the condition. Such terms are common.\nThroughout the British Columbia Courts and on this appeal, the case was argued on the narrow ground of non-performance of the condition. I am not overlooking the fact that soon after the contract was executed, O\u2019Reilly wrote to his neighbour, the owner of Lot 8, regretting the fact that he had agreed to sell and notifying him that the contract was subject to a condition. There is very little evidence on this point. A representative of the purchaser company did go to see the neighbour. There is no evidence that he made any offer. The neighbour was not called as a witness.\nThe case was not put in and not argued on the basis that performance of the condition precedent had been prevented by the act of the vendor. If this had been pleaded and proved, the result here might have been different.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment at trial dismissing the action.\nAppeal allowed and judgment at trial restored; with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: de Villiers, Jones & Marsden, Victoria.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Clay, Macfarlane, Ellis & Popham, Victoria.\n[1] (1968), 1 D.L.R.

The highway ran east and west and had six lanes, the two outside lanes being parking lanes. The appellant, as he was about to leave the curb at the northeast corner, saw a truck approaching from the east in the most northerly driving lane. The truck slowed down to permit him to cross. As he crossed in front of the truck, he looked to his left, and not seeing the respondent\u2019s automobile because it was still hidden by the truck concentrated his attention on traffic coming from the west. After he had taken a few steps from in front of the truck, he was hit by the respondent\u2019s automobile which was in the inside lane.\nThe appellant was severely bruised on his right hip and suffered a wrenched back with a probable extrusion of a lumbar disc. In hospital he underwent a painful operation and thereafter his injuries continued to cause him pain. About a year later he suffered an attack of phlebitis which was found to have been caused by the accident.\nAt the time he was injured the appellant was a man 29 years of age with the ability and opportunity to earn as much as $1,000 a month as a tunnel construction worker. The permanent and partially disabling nature of his injuries made it necessary that he avoid the field of heavy industry and he was thus reduced to less remunerative employment.\nAt trial, the respondent was found wholly responsible for the accident.\nThe appellant was awarded $7,000 general damages and $973 special damages. On appeal, the Court of Appeal increased the award of general damages to $12,000 and on the respondent\u2019s cross-appeal found the appellant 20 per cent at fault. The appellant then appealed to this Court against the 20 per cent finding of fault and for an increase in general damages beyond the $12,000 awarded by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld (Abbott J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.: The finding by the trial judge that the respondent was solely at fault should be restored. The Court of Appeal had erred in saying that the trial judge had held that as the appellant entered the southerly lane he was running or walking fast. This was a recapitulation of what the respondent had said and not a finding of fact by the trial judge. The appellant was entitled to a substantial award for pain and suffering and for loss of enjoyment of life apart altogether from loss of income prior to trial and for future loss by reason of the permanent nature of his injuries. The amount awarded by the Court of Appeal was inordinately low and such a wholly erroneous assessment that this Court was justified in increasing the award for general damages from $12,000 to $30,000.\nPer Abbott J., dissenting: Very exceptional circumstances had not been established in the present case, and, except in such circumstances, a second appellate Court will not interfere with the amounts fixed by the first appellate Court where they differ from the damages assessed by the trial judge.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, allowing an appeal and a cross-appeal from a judgment of Wilson C.J.S.C. Appeal allowed, Abbott J. dissenting.\nB.W.F. McLoughlin, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJ.A. Fraser, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014The appellant, a pedestrian, was injured when struck by the right front corner of the respondent\u2019s automobile as he was crossing Broadway Avenue in the City of Vancouver at about 2:30 p.m. on September 18, 1965. The day was bright and clear, visibility good and the pavement dry. He brought action against the respondent and recovered judgment for $7,000 as general damages and $973 special damages following a trial before Chief Justice Wilson of the Supreme Court of British Columbia who found the respondent wholly responsible for the accident.\nThe appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, claiming the amount awarded for general damages was insufficient. The respondent cross-appealed on the issue of liability. The Court of Appeal increased the award for general damages to $12,000 and on the cross-appeal found the appellant 20 per cent at fault.\nThe appellant now appeals to this Court against the 20 per cent finding of fault and for an increase in general damages beyond the $12,000 awarded by the Court of Appeal.\nBroadway Avenue is a six-lane highway running east and west, the two outside lanes being parking lanes. The accident occurred at the intersection of Broadway Avenue and Laurel Street which intersects Broadway Avenue at right angles. The appellant was at the northeast corner of the intersection and intended crossing to the southeast corner. There were no traffic-control signals at this intersection. Accordingly, s. 169 of the Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 253, as it read in 1965 applied. The section then read:\n169. (1) Subject to section 170, where traffic-control signals are not in place or not in operation when a pedestrian is crossing the highway within a crosswalk and the pedestrian is upon the half of the highway upon which the vehicle is travelling or is approaching so closely from the other half of the highway that he is in danger, the driver of the vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to the pedestrian.\n(2) No pedestrian shall leave a curb or other place of safety and walk or run into the path of a vehicle that is so close that it is impracticable for the driver to yield the right-of-way.\n(3) Where a vehicle is slowing down or stopped at a crosswalk or at an intersection to permit a pedestrian to cross the highway, no driver of another vehicle approaching from the rear shall overtake and pass the vehicle which is slowing down or stopped.\n(4) The driver of a motor-vehicle shall obey the instruction of school pupils acting as members of school patrols provided under the Public Schools Act.\nA crosswalk is defined by s. 121 of the Motor-vehicle Act as follows:\n\u201ccrosswalk means\u201d\n(a) any portion of the roadway at an intersection or elsewhere distinctly indicated for pedestrian crossing by signs or by lines or other markings on the surface; or\n(b) the portion of a highway at an intersection that is included within the connection of the lateral lines of the sidewalks on the opposite sides of the highway, or within the extension of the lateral lines of the sidewalk on one side of the highway, measured from the curbs or, in the absence of curbs, from the edges of the roadway;\nAs he was about to cross Broadway Avenue, the appellant saw a truck approaching from his left (east). It was in the most northerly driving lane. This truck slowed down and appellant accepted this as an indication that it was safe for him to proceed to cross the intersection in the unmarked crosswalk. The appellant saw no other vehicle approaching from the east. The respondent\u2019s automobile was actually approaching from the east and catching up to the truck, but it was hidden from appellant\u2019s view by the truck. As he crossed in front of the truck, the appellant looked to his left, and not seeing the respondent\u2019s automobile because it was still hidden by the truck concentrated his attention on traffic coming from the west which might affect him once he was at or over the centre of the street. After he had taken a few steps from in front of the truck, he was hit by respondent\u2019s automobile which was in the inside lane. The truck which had slowed down to allow the appellant to cross in front of it continued westward its driver apparently unaware that the pedestrian who had just passed in front of his truck had been struck.\nThe respondent appears to have seen the pedestrian (the appellant) because he applied his brakes and skidded some 24 feet before striking the appellant. There is no question of the respondent\u2019s negligence. He was clearly in breach of s. 169 of the Act in that, having seen the truck slow down at the approach to the intersection, he proceeded to overtake and pass the truck and did not abate his speed sufficiently until it was too late for him to avoid hitting the appellant who was lawfully in the crosswalk and had right-of-way over approaching vehicles.\nThe learned trial judge said in this regard:\nThis is one of the most common situations in city motoring. The defendant could not, because of the truck, see to the right where the plaintiff was. When he saw the truck on his right slow or stop he ought at once to have known that danger was present and that in all probability the danger was that of striking a pedestrian coming from the north of the truck, where he had no view. It became his duty at once to slow or stop his car to avert the possibility of an accident and he did not do so but drove on until he saw the plaintiff when it was too late to stop. His speed, reasonable under other circumstances, was excessive, because, so soon as he saw the truck slow or stop (and he was behind it) he should have so controlled his car as to avoid any chance of striking a pedestrian in the crosswalk.\nand regarding the allegation of contributory negligence made against the appellant, he said:\nWas the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence? He had the right-of-way and was entitled to expect that motorists would respect it. The truck did respect it. Was he not then entitled to expect that vehicles to the south of the truck would observe the action of the truck and act accordingly? I think he was. I do not say that he might not, by the exercise of extreme vigilance, have avoided this accident, but I do not think that in the circumstances such a degree of vigilance was required of him. I find that the defendant is wholly liable.\nThe Court of Appeal accepted the learned trial judge\u2019s finding that the respondent was negligent, but found the appellant guilty of contributory negligence and fixed his percentage of fault at 20 per cent. In so doing, the Court of Appeal said:\nThe appellant did not see the respondent\u2019s car as he left the curb because, as other evidence establishes, the pickup truck, which the appellant saw, was running about a length ahead of the respondent\u2019s car and obscured his vision. The respondent did not see the appellant until it was too late to avoid the collision, and the appellant never did see the respondent\u2019s car. It is quite apparent, however, that if he had paused momentarily and looked to his left before entering the southerly westbound lane he would have seen the respondent\u2019s car. The learned Trial Judge has held that as the appellant entered the southerly lane he was running or walking fast. It seems to me that a quick look before entering the southerly lane would have sufficed to enable him to avoid being struck down.\n(Emphasis added.)\nThe Court of Appeal was in error in saying: \u201cThe learned Trial Judge has held that as the appellant entered the southerly lane he was running or walking fast.\u201d It is clear from the record that no such finding was made by Wilson C.J.S.C. He did say when recapitulating the evidence of the respondent that the respondent had said: \u201cHe (the appellant) was running or walking fast\u201d but that was a statement of what the respondent had said and not a finding of fact, and Wilson C.J.S.C. did not say that he accepted the respondent\u2019s evidence in this regard for it is evident that he did not do so. He chose instead to accept the evidence of Preovolos who was a passenger in the respondent\u2019s automobile.\nThis error appears to have influenced the Court of Appeal to find the appellant partly at fault to the extent of 20 per cent. I do not think that the Court of Appeal was justified in disturbing the learned trial judge\u2019s finding that the appellant was not at fault on the basis of this misreading of Wilson C.J.S.C.\u2019s reasons. I would accordingly allow the appeal on this aspect of the case and restore the finding that the respondent was solely at fault.\nThe Court of Appeal\u2019s award of $12,000 as general damages is also challenged by the appellant as being a wholly erroneous assessment in the light of the injuries sustained by the appellant and the permanent and partially disabling nature of those injuries as established in evidence. The evidence as to the injuries sustained by the appellant is fully reviewed by the Court of Appeal as follows:\nThe accident happened on the 18th of September, 1965. The plaintiff (appellant), then an active man of 29 years of age, was struck by the respondent\u2019s car, thrown into the air and landed on the ground. He was severely bruised on the right hip and suffered a wrenched back with a probable extrusion of a lumbar disc. He has suffered extreme pain in the lower back area. He was in the hospital for 29 days and was at home for another two weeks without being able to move very much. Following this period he was partially mobile at home for a period of some six weeks. While in hospital the appellant underwent an operation whereby fluid was extracted from his spine and a pigment inserted for the purpose of tracing the flow of pigment in order to assist the diagnosis of his lower back injuries. The operation caused the appellant excruciating pain. The injury to the lower back caused pain right up to the time of trial. The pain radiated down into his right leg.\nOn November 30th, 1966, the appellant suffered an attack of phlebitis at Prince George shortly after he had taken a bus ride from Vancouver. Following this attack he could not work for the following seven months.\nUp to November, 1966, the physician looking after the appellant had considered his principal difficulty to be that arising from the injury to his lower spine. The presence of phlebitis had not been suspected but when the phlebitis attack took place on November 30th, 1966, it became apparent that the appellant\u2019s principal complaint arose from the phlebitis in his right leg. In view of the fact that the appellant\u2019s phlebitis was not diagnosed as such until after a year from the date of the accident, there was some conflict of medical opinion as to whether the condition was caused by the accident. However, there was a sound basis for the learned trial Judge\u2019s finding that the accident caused the phlebitis.\nDr. Sladen, a vascular specialist, described in some detail the damage caused by the disease to the appellant\u2019s right leg and he said that the leg was permanently damaged. The best that he could hold out for the patient was that he could control the effects of the trouble by keeping the leg raised at night and by the application of a rubber bandage by day. Failure to take these precautions may bring about a throbbing sensation which could be followed by ulceration. Further, the doctor said that the patient\u2019s condition would be a handicap to him in his work, and that heavy lifting increased the pressure and therefore the reflux. Later in his evidence he said:\nA\u2026. The leg itself, the basic pathology, is certainly not improving. It\u2019s there. And the same problem will re-occur any time that he stresses this leg. And I think if you talk to him you will find that he has tried to work and it has swollen up on him during this period. So I don\u2019t think the leg is any better really than when I saw him initially.\nQ. You have described for us, Doctor, a number of events that might occur, having had this phlebitis condition. Is it fair to say that there are many people who suffer from phlebitis who can lead a normal life thereafter?\nA. I don\u2019t think \u201cnormal\u201d is the word. I think that everybody that has had this disease pays some sacrifice to it or some penalty for it. And it depends on its degree and the amount involved and the type of stress that the patient is going to put on it as to where they fall on the scale.\nDr. W.H. Sutherland, likewise a vascular specialist, confirmed the opinion of Dr. Sladen and said that: \u201c\u2026 there is evidence of deep vein phlebitis in this leg; in fact, a very extensive amount of this disease.\u201d\nHe also said that:\n\u201cI would confirm exactly what Dr. Sladen said. Depending on the amount of the care he can give this limb, it will serve him reasonably well but will slowly progress. The less care he is able to give it the more rapid will be the progression.\u201d Dealing again with the patient\u2019s ability to engage in heavy industry, he said:\n\u201cI think heavy lifting would be troublesome to him by the end of the day. The problem about heavy industry or heavy labour is the real possibility of further injury to this limb.\u201d\nAs will be seen, the principal residual disability stems from the phlebitis which the learned trial judge found was caused by the accident. This finding was concurred in by the Court of Appeal and is fully supported by the evidence. The original low award of $7,000 arose, I think, from the learned trial judge\u2019s view that the appellant was regarded initially by his doctors as being guilty of emotional exaggeration of the extent of his pain and injuries. This assessment, now recognized to be erroneous of the appellant\u2019s condition and subsequent pain, was due to the fact that the phlebitis was not recognized and diagnosed as such until January 5, 1967, more than a year after the accident.\nOnce it is accepted that the appellant is suffering from phlebitis, the medical evidence conclusively establishes that he should avoid heavy lifting and violent movement. One of the medical witnesses suggested that a job as a bar tender would be about right for the appellant\u2019s capabilities. Maclean J.A. said in his reasons:\nIt is of course obvious that the accident has considerably narrowed the field of employment open to the appellant. If he has any regard at all for his future welfare and health he must avoid the field of heavy industry in which he previously made his living, and he must take lighter employment even though it may be less remunerative.\nIt is on this basis that appellant\u2019s damages should be assessed. He was a man 29 years of age with the ability and opportunity to earn as much as $1,000 a month as a member of the Tunnel and Rock Workers\u2019 Union. Such an opportunity was available to him at \u2018the time he was injured and he would have been able to earn approximately $1,000 a month in the interval between the time he was injured and the date of the trial. He estimated this loss at $10,750. He had no assurance, of course, that such work would always be available in British Columbia or even in Canada or that he could work continuously at tunnelling work, and besides he was always subject to the hazards of illness and accident to which all men are liable. He suffered a great deal of pain and will have pain in the future. He is permanently reduced to employment from which his earnings will not nearly approximate what he could have made as a member of his union even if he did not work full time at tunnelling or similar jobs.\nHe was, by every standard, entitled to a substantial award for pain and suffering and for loss of enjoyment of life apart altogether from loss of income prior to trial and for future loss by reason of the permanent nature of his injuries. Taking everything into consideration, including his record of earnings for the five-year period preceding the accident, I am of the view that the amount awarded by the Court of Appeal is inordinately low and such a wholly erroneous assessment that this Court is justified in increasing the award for general damages from $12,000 to $30,000. I would give the appellant judgment for this amount plus his special damages. The judgment of the learned trial judge should be affirmed but varied by increasing the sum awarded by way of general damages to $30,000. The appellant should also have his costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court.\nABBOTT J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts are set out in the reasons of my brother Hall which I have had the advantage of considering. As he has stated, the Court of Appeal increased the award to appellant for general damages from $7,000 to $12,000, and on the cross-appeal found the appellant 20 per cent at fault. It is trite law of course that, as to the quantum of damages, a second appellate Court will not, except in very exceptional circumstances, interfere with the amounts fixed by the first appellate Court where they differ from the damages assessed by the trial judge. In my opinion, such exceptional circumstances have not been established in the present case and I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, ABBOTT J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Lawrence & Shaw, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Ladner, Downs & Co., Vancouver.\n",

The Insurance Act further provides that, should a claim be made against the fund, the order of priority shall favour those who have suffered losses and that those who have claims for unearned premiums should come second. The order of priority provided for in the Winding-up Act ranks both claims for losses and claims for unearned premiums on an equal footing. On December 13, 1966, The Wentworth Insurance Company which had been incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario and had carried out business in that province with its head office in Toronto, was ordered to be wound-up and a provisional liquidator was appointed. The appointment of a permanent liquidator was made on January 27, 1967. In the meantime, by order dated December 19, 1966, the provisional liquidator was appointed receiver so to administer the deposit pursuant to the provisions of The Insurance Act without prejudice to the right of the provisional and of the permanent liquidator to administer the fund under the Winding-up Act. The Master\u2019s interim report required the liquidator to administer the fund in accordance with The Insurance Act. Upon appeal by these policyholders who had claims for refund of unearned premiums the Court of first instance confirmed the report. Upon further appeal, the Court of Appeal unanimously held that the interim report should be varied and that the fund and securities be deposited in the manner provided for in the Winding-up Act. Leave to appeal to this Court was granted.\nHeld (Ritchie, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.: The words of s. 165(1) of the Winding-up Act regarding the transfer to the liquidator of all funds and securities that may be on deposit with any government in Canada or with trustees for the benefit of policyholders are plain and cannot mean anything else than that the fund deposited had to be distributed according to the provisions of that Act. Furthermore, the provisions of The Insurance Act which purports to lay down a scheme of distribution upon insolvency were invalid per se or, in any event, were certainly overborne by the distribution provisions of the Winding-up Act with which they cannot be compatibly administered.\nSection 173 of the Winding-up Act, which provides that \u201cthe priority of any mortgage, lien or charge on the property of the company\u201d shall not be prejudiced by reason of the winding\u2011up, is not applicable to the present case. The word \u201ccharge\u201d does not include any type of interest created by the alleged statutory trust and refers to an interest in existence, whereas the policyholders acquired no interest except perhaps, at the very most, a prospective one, prior to the administrative order which was, in fact, made at a date subsequent to the winding-up.\nPer Hall, Ritchie, Spence and Pigeon JJ., dissenting: The power granted to the Minister under The Insurance Act of Ontario to require a deposit as a condition precedent to the granting of a licence must include as a necessary consequence the power to administer it if such power is not to become, to a great extent, illusory. The vital question is, therefore, not the exclusive jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada on matters of bankruptcy and insolvency but whether Parliament, by enacting section 165(1) of the Winding up Act, in fact, intruded in a field of legislation, namely insurance, which by virtue of section 92 of the B.N.A. Act and of a succession of decisions in the Privy Council and in this Court, has been held as exclusively subject to provincial law. The Insurance Act is in \u201cpith and substance\u201d insurance legislation and consequently its disputed sections, in so far as they relate to the administration of a deposit, deal with bankruptcy and insolvency only as incidental to the right to legislate regarding insurance. It follows that section 165(1) of the Winding-up Act, by attempting to divert the deposit of its true purpose was ultra vires of Parliament.\nAssurances\u2014Droit constitutionnel\u2014Compagnie op\u00e9rant en vertu d\u2019un\u2019permis de la province d\u2019Ontario mise en liquidation sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 d\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale\u2014Argents et titres d\u00e9pos\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s du ministre devaient-ils \u00eatre g\u00e9r\u00e9s aux termes de la loi provinciale ou de la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale\u2014Loi sur les liquidations, S.R.C. 1952, c. 296, art.

Un liquidateur provisoire fut d\u00e9sign\u00e9. La nomination d\u2019un liquidateur permanent fut faite le 27 janvier 1967. Pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, par une ordonnance, dat\u00e9e le 19 d\u00e9cembre 1966, le liquidateur provisoire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 receveur aux fins de g\u00e9rer le d\u00e9p\u00f4t suivant les exigences de la Loi sur les assurances et sans pr\u00e9judice aux droits du liquidateur provisoire et du liquidateur permanent d\u00e9sign\u00e9s en vertu des dispositions de la Loi sur les liquidations.

La Cour de premi\u00e8re instance, qui a entendu les appels des d\u00e9tenteurs de police qui r\u00e9clamaient un remboursement de primes, a confirm\u00e9 le rapport.

La question essentielle n\u2019est donc pas celle de la comp\u00e9tence exclusive du Parlement du Canada en mati\u00e8re de faillite ou d\u2019insolvabilit\u00e9, mais celle de savoir si le Parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, en introduisant l\u2019art. 165(1) dans la Loi sur les liquidations n\u2019a pas, en fait, empi\u00e9t\u00e9 sur un domaine l\u00e9gislatif, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019assurance, qui en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019art. 92 de l\u2019 A.A.N.B. et suivant les d\u00e9cisions r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es du Conseil Priv\u00e9, fait partie du domaine exclusif des l\u00e9gislatures provinciales.

The judgment of Cartwright C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014Under the provisions of The Ontario Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 190, s. 41, every insurer carrying on business in Ontario is required to deposit with the Minister approved securities in certain defined amounts. While these securities are on deposit the property is vested in the Minister without any formal transfer (s. 42(5)). Nevertheless, the insurer is entitled to receive the interest on the deposits as long as it satisfies the conditions of the Act and no notice of any final judgment against the insurer or order for its winding-up or for the distribution of its assets or for the administration of its deposit is given to the Minister.\nBy order dated December 13, 1966, Wentworth Insurance Company was ordered to be wound up under the Winding-up Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 296. A provisional liquidator was appointed the same day and a permanent liquidator on January 27, 1967. In the meantime, by order dated December 19, 1966, the company\u2019s deposit of securities under s. 41 of The Insurance Act was ordered to be administered pursuant to the provisions of that Act, and the provisional liquidator was appointed receiver so to administer the deposit. This order was made without prejudice to the rights of the provisional liquidator and the permanent liquidator under the Winding-up Act and, particularly, s. 165 of that Act.\nIt is apparent that the issue with which we are concerned was recognized very early in the proceedings. The Ontario Insurance Act provides for a certain order of priorities for claimants against this fund. Briefly, those insured persons who have suffered losses come first. Those who have claims for unearned premiums come second. Under the Winding-up Act these two classes of creditors rank pari passu.\nIn the winding-up proceedings, in his interim report, dated September 19, 1967, the Master found that the liquidator was required to administer the fund in the manner provided by ss. 58 and 59 of The Insurance Act. There was an appeal from this report by those policyholders who had claims for refunds of unearned premiums. The judge of first instance, by order dated February 21, 1968, dismissed the appeal and confirmed the report. An appeal to the Court of Appeal followed. That Court unanimously held that the appeal should be allowed and the interim report of the Master varied and an order made that the liquidator administer the funds and securities deposited as above mentioned in the manner provided by the Winding\u2011up Act. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court on July 4,1968.\nThe Master held that the legislation relating to the deposit was in \u201cpith and substance\u201d insurance legislation and that the deposit was vested in the Minister in trust for the benefit of the policyholders and that he should be free to deal with it according to the provisions of the Insurance Act. In his view, the deposit was a \u201ccharge\u201d within the meaning of that word in s. 173 of the Winding-up Act, which reads as follows:\n173. Nothing in this Part prejudices or affects the priority of any mortgage, lien or charge upon the property of the company.\nMr. Justice Hartt, while affirming the decision of the Master, did so for different reasons. In his view, the effect of s. 41 of The Insurance Act was to vest the deposit in the Minister in trust for the policyholders. Therefore, on ordinary principles of the law of trusts, the deposit was not the property of the company and could not be distributed on insolvency according to the Winding-up Act. He did not agree with the Master that s. 173 was applicable. This section only applied where there was a charge upon the company\u2019s property. He rested his judgment on the statutory trust which took the deposit out of the classification of \u201cproperty of the company\u201d.\nThe Court of Appeal unanimously reversed this decision. Mr. Justice Laskin, speaking for the Court, conceded that Hartt J.\u2019s reasoning would be most convincing if one had to rely solely upon s. 33 of the Winding-up Act. Section 33 reads:\n33. The liquidator, upon his appointment, shall take into his custody or under his control, all the property, effects and choses in action to which the company is or appears to be entitled, and he shall perform such duties in reference to winding up the business of the company as are imposed by the court or by this Act.\nHowever, there was s. 165(1) which was enacted to deal with this very situation. Section 165(1) reads:\n165. (1) The funds and securities of the company in Canada that may be on deposit with any government in Canada or with trustees or otherwise held for the company or for the protection of the policyholders of the company of the class or classes that are affected by the winding-up order shall, on order of the court having jurisdiction, be transferred to the liquidator.\nHe could not see how the plain words of this section could mean anything else than that the fund deposited had to be distributed according to the provisions of the Winding-up Act. Furthermore, he was of opinion that the provisions of The Insurance Act purporting to provide for a scheme of distribution upon insolvency were invalid per se or, in any event, were certainly overborne by the distribution provisions of the Winding-up Act.\nAnd finally, there were in his view at least three reasons why s. 173 was not applicable. First, on an ejusdem generis construction, the word \u201ccharge\u201d did not include the type of interest created by the alleged statutory trust. Secondly, the term \u201ccharge\u201d refers to an interest in existence at the time of the winding-up order. Here the policyholders acquired no interest until an administration order was made. Their interest was at the very most prospective until the advent of the order. Thirdly, the winding-up order was made before the administration order. Therefore, the deposit was subject to the transfer order under s. 165(1) before the creation of any beneficial interest in the loss claimants.\nI agree with the reasons of the Court of Appeal in their entirety and have nothing to add. I would dismiss the appeal and make the same order as to costs in this Court, namely, that the permanent liquidator and the competing classes of policyholders should have their costs of the appeal out of the deposit on a solicitor and own client basis. There will be no costs to or against the Attorney-General for Ontario and the Intervenants.\nThe judgment of Ritchie, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by\nHALL J. (dissenting):\u2014The Wentworth Insurance Company was incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario and carried on the business of insurance in Ontario, with head office at Toronto. A succession of decisions in the Privy Council and in this Court have held that the business of insurance is exclusively subject to provincial law and that by s. 92 of the B.N.A. Act the provinces have exclusive jurisdiction to prescribe the way in which insurance business shall be carried on in the province. Dominion legislation which encroaches upon or intermeddles with such exclusive provincial jurisdiction is ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament. Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[2]; A.-G. Canada v. A.-G. Alta[3]; Re Reciprocal Ins. Legislation[4]; In Re The Insurance Act of Canada[5], Re Home Assurance Co.[6]\nActing within its exclusive right to legislate regarding insurance, the Province of Ontario enacted The Insurance Act R.S.O. 1960, c. 190. This Act is a lengthy statute with XVI Parts, 353 sections, and deals with all phases and modes of insurance, other than those specifically excluded by s. 21(4). This Act and Part VI of The Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 71, was intended by the Legislature to cover the entire field of insurance and to provide a complete and comprehensive code respecting the law of insurance in the Province of Ontario. Martin J.A., as he then was, in Crown Bakery v. Preferred Accident Insurance Company[7] said:\nA perusal of The Saskatchewan Insurance Act, as it was enacted in 1915 and again in 1924-25, convinces me that the Legislature intended to cover the entire field of insurance, and to enact a complete code of law to govern all insurance contracts in the province,\u2026\nThe Saskatchewan Insurance Act and The Ontario Insurance Act are almost identical in scope and this observation would apply equally to the Ontario legislation.\nPart I of The Insurance Act provides for a Superintendent of Insurance by s. 2(1) which reads:\n2. (1) A Superintendent of Insurance shall be appointed who shall exercise the powers and perform the duties vested or imposed upon him by this or any other Act, shall have the general supervision of the business of insurance in Ontario and shall see that the laws relating to the conduct thereof are enforced and obeyed.\nPart II of The Act applies to insurance undertaken in Ontario and to all insurers carrying on business in Ontario (s. 20(1)). S. 21(1) and (2) read:\n21. (1) Every insurer undertaking insurance in Ontario or carrying on business in Ontario shall obtain from the Minister and hold a licence under this Act.\n(2) Every insurer undertaking insurance or carrying on business in Ontario without having obtained a licence as required by this section is guilty of an offence. and prohibit anyone undertaking insurance or carrying on the business of insurance in Ontario unless licenced to do so. A licence issued under s. 21(1) authorizes, as stated in s. 23:\n23. (1) Upon due application and upon proof of compliance with this Act, the Minister may issue a licence to undertake contracts of insurance and carry on business in Ontario to any insurer coming within one of the following classes:\n1. Joint stock insurance companies.\n2. Mutual insurance corporations.\n3. Cash-mutual insurance corporations.\n4. Fraternal societies.\n5. Mutual benefit societies.\n6. Companies duly incorporated to undertake insurance contracts and not within classes 1 to 5.\n7. Reciprocal or inter-insurance exchanges.\n8. Underwriters or syndicates of underwriters operating on the plan known as Lloyds.\n9. Pension fund associations.\n(2) A licence issued under this Act authorizes the insurer named therein to exercise in Ontario all rights and powers reasonably incidental to the carrying on of the business of insurance named therein that are not inconsistent with this Act or with its act or instrument of incorporation or organization.\nCertain conditions precedent to the issuing of a licence are set out in s. 32.\nS. 41 and 42 which read:\n41. (1) Every insurer carrying on the business of insurance in Ontario shall, before receiving a licence under this Act, deposit approved securities with the Minister in the following amounts: (emphasis added)\n1. Where the insurer undertakes life insurance\u2014$50,000.\n2. Where the insurer undertakes any one or more classes of insurance other than life,\ni. in Ontario only\u2014$25,000.\nii. in Ontario and elsewhere\u2014$50,000.\n(2) The Superintendent may require the deposit referred to in subsection 1 to be increased, either before or after granting the licence, to such amount as he considers necessary.\n(3) An insurer may voluntarily make a deposit in excess of the amount prescribed by this section, but no part of a voluntary deposit shall be withdrawn without the sanction of the Minister.\n42. (1) The value of such securities shall be estimated at their market value, not exceeding par, at the time they are deposited.\n(2) If any other than approved securities are offered as a deposit, the Minister may accept them on such valuation and on such conditions as he deems proper.\n(3) If the market value of any securities that have been deposited by an insurer declines below that at which they were deposited, the Minister may notify the insurer to make such further deposit as will ensure the accepted value of all the securities deposited by the insure being equal to the amount that is required by this Act to be deposited.\n(4) On failure by the insurer to make such further deposit within sixty days after being called upon so to do, the Minister may suspend or cancel the licence of the insurer.\n(5) The property in any stock, bonds or debentures deposited with the Minister under this Act or any predecessor thereof is vested in the Minister by virtue of his office without any formal transfer while such stock, bonds or debentures form the whole or any part of the deposit required by this Act. (emphasis added)\n(6) So long as the conditions of this Act are satisfied and no notice of any final judgment against the insurer or order for its winding-up or for the distribution of its assets or for administration of its deposit is given to the Minister, the insurer is entitled to receive the interest upon the securities forming the deposit.\nare the sections which provide for the deposit, and it will be observed that the deposit called for by section 41 is made a condition precedent to receiving a licence under the Act.\nIn sections 46 to 73 the Act provides for the administration of the deposit required by s. 41. Specifically, sections 48 to 52 provide as follows:\n48. (1) The deposit made by an insurer under this Act is subject to administration in the manner hereinafter provided.\n(2) Subject to sections 69 and 70, the deposit shall be held and administered for the benefit of all insured persons under Ontario contracts and they are entitled to share in the proceeds of the deposit. (emphasis added)\n(3) An insured person under an Ontario contract is entitled to share in the proceeds of the deposit in respect of,\n(a) a claim for a loss that is covered by the contract and that occurred before the termination date fixed under section 53 of this Act or section 233 of The Corporations Act; or\n(b) a claim for refund of unearned premiums, except in the case of life insurance; or\n(c) a claim for payment of the legal reserve in respect of the contract in the case of life insurance; or\n(d) claims under both clauses a and b.\n49. (1) An application for administration of a deposit shall be made by originating notice of motion to a judge of the Supreme Court.\n(2) The application shall be made in the county or district,\n(a) in which the head office of the insurer is situate; or\n(b) in which the chief office of the insurer in Ontario is situate if its head office is out of Ontario.\n50. (1) With the approval of the Minister, the Superintendent may make application for administration at any time when, in his opinion, it is necessary or desirable for the protection of the insured person entitled to share in the proceeds of the deposit.\n(2) In the case of a reciprocal deposit held in Ontario, the superintendent of insurance of a reciprocating province may make application for administration of the deposit. (3) An insured person entitled to share in the proceeds of a deposit may make application for administration of the deposit upon producing evidence,\n(a) that he has served the Superintendent with a notice in writing of his intention to make application if the Superintendent or the superintendent of insurance of a reciprocating province does not apply; and\n(b) that sixty days have elapsed since the service of the notice and that no application for administration of the deposit has been made.\n(4) In the case of a reciprocal deposit, if the Superintendent is served with a notice as provided in subsection 3, he shall forthwith notify the superintendent of insurance of each reciprocating province that he has been so served.\n51. (1) The applicant for administration of the deposit shall serve the originating notice of motion at least ten days before the date specified in the notice for the making of the application,\n(a) upon the insurer or, where the insurer is in liquidation, upon the liquidator of the insurer; and\n(b) upon the Superintendent; and\n(c) in the case of a reciprocal deposit, upon the superintendent of insurance of each reciprocating province.\n(2) An applicant for administration is entitled to an order for administration upon proof,\n(a) that the licence of the insurer has been cancelled, and that its assets are insufficient to discharge its outstanding liabilities; or\n(b) that an order has been made for the winding up of the insurer, or\n(c) that the insurer has failed to pay,\n(i) an undisputed claim for sixty days after it has been admitted, or\n(ii) a disputed claim after final judgment and tender of a valid discharge,\nif the claim arose under a contract of insurance in respect of which the deposit is subject to administration.\n52. (1) Upon granting an order for administration, the court shall appoint a receiver to administer the deposit.\n(2) Where a provisional liquidator or a liquidator has been appointed under this Act or The Corporations Act or a liquidator has been appointed under the Winding-up Act (Canada) to wind up a company that has made a deposit under this Act, the court may appoint the provisional liquidator or the liquidator as the receiver to administer the deposit.\n(3) Thereupon the provisional liquidator or the liquidator shall administer the deposit for the benefit of the insured persons entitled to share in the proceeds thereof in accordance with the provisions of and the priorities set out in this Act.\nSections 58 and 59 read:\n58. The proceeds of the deposit are payable,\n(a) first, in payment of the receiver and of all costs and expenses incurred by him in the administration of the deposit and in payment of the remuneration, costs and expenses of the provisional liquidator as ordered by the Minister under section 229 of The Corporations Act; (b) second, in payment of the insured persons who are entitled to share in the proceeds of the deposit in accordance with the priorities set out in section 59.\n59. (1) Except in the case of life insurance, each insured person who claims in respect of a loss covered by the contract that occurred before the termination date fixed under section 53 of this Act or section 233 of The Corporations Act is entitled to receive payment of his approved or settled claim in full in priority to the insured persons who claim in respect of refunds of unearned premiums.\n(2) Subject to subsection 1, an insured person who claims in respect of a refund of unearned premiums may claim such part of the premium paid as is proportionate to the period of his contract unexpired,\n(a) at the termination date fixed by the receiver under section 53 or fixed by the provisional liquidator or the liquidator under section 233 of The Corporations Act; or\n(b) at the date the insured person cancelled the contract, whichever is the earlier date.\n(3) In the case of life insurance, each insured person who has a claim for a loss covered by the contract that occurred before the termination date fixed under section 53 of this Act or section 233 of The Corporations Act ranks in the distribution of the proceeds of the deposit for the approved or settled amount of the claim pari passu with insured persons under unmatured life insurance contracts.\n(4) An insured person under an unmatured life insurance contract is entitled to the full amount of the legal reserve in respect of his contract determined by the receiver according to the valuation thereof approved by the Superintendent under this Act.\nThese sections must be read in conjunction with sections 231 and 232 of Part VI of The Corporations Act, respecting insurance corporations. These sections provide:\n231. (1) The provisional liquidator or the liquidator, before any order granting administration of the deposit and before the fixing of a termination date pursuant to section 233, may arrange for the reinsurance of the subsisting contracts of insurance of the insurer with some other insurer licensed in Ontario.\n(2) For the purpose of securing the reinsurance, the following funds shall be available:.\n1. The entire assets of the insurer in Ontario other than the deposit except the amount, reasonably estimated by the provisional liquidator or the liquidator as being required to pay,\n(a) the costs of the liquidation or winding up;\n(b) all claims for losses covered by the insurer\u2019s contracts of insurance of which notice has been received by the insurer or provisional liquidator or liquidator before the date on which the reinsurance is effected;\n(c) the claims of the preferred creditors who are the persons paid in priority to other creditors under the winding up provisions of this Act,\nall of which shall be a first charge on the assets of the insurer, other than the deposit.\n2. All or such portion, if any, of the deposit as is agreed upon pursuant to subsection 3. (3) If it appears necessary or desirable to secure reinsurance for the protection of insured persons entitled to share in the proceeds of the deposit, the Minister, on the recommendation of the Superintendent, or, in the case of a reciprocal deposit, the superintendents of insurance of the reciprocating provinces, may enter into an agreement with the provisional liquidator or the liquidator, whereby, pursuant to section 47 or 71 of The Insurance Act, all or any part of the securities in the deposit may be used for the purpose of securing the reinsurance.\n(4) The creditors of the insurer, other than the insured persons and the said preferred creditors, are entitled to receive a payment on their claims only if provision has been made for the payments mentioned in subsection 2 and for the reinsurance.\n(5) If, after providing for the payments mentioned in subsection 2, the balance of the assets of the insurer, together with all or such portion, if any, of the deposit as is agreed upon under subsection 3, is insufficient to secure the reinsurance of the contracts of the insured persons in full, the reinsurance may be effected for such portion of the full amount of the contracts as is possible.\n(6) No contract of reinsurance shall be entered into under this section until it is approved by the Supreme Court.\n232. (1) In the winding up of an insurer that has made a deposit pursuant to The Insurance Act, if the person appointed as receiver to administer the deposit pursuant to section 52 of The Insurance Act is not the person appointed as the provisional liquidator or the liquidator under The Insurance Act or this Act or appointed as the liquidator under the Winding-up Act (Canada), as the case may be, the Supreme Court at any time in its discretion may order that the deposit and the administration thereof be transferred from the receiver to the provisional liquidator or the liquidator.\n(2) Upon the making of an order under subsection 1, the provisional liquidator or the liquidator shall administer the deposit for the benefit of the persons entitled to share in the proceeds thereof in accordance with the provisions of and the priorities set out in this Act.\n(3) The amount payable to the provisional liquidator or the liquidator for administering the deposit and all costs and expenses incurred by him in administering the deposit shall be paid out of the deposit in accordance with the priorities fixed by clause a of section 58 of The Insurance Act, but the amount payable to the provisional liquidator or the liquidator and all costs and expenses incurred by him in the winding up of the insurer shall not be paid out of the deposit but shall be paid out of and are a first charge on the assets of the insurer except as provided in subsection 3 of section 229.\nIt will be seen that the provisions of section 232 above correspond to those in s. 52 of The Insurance Act.\nWentworth Insurance Company became insolvent and was ordered to be wound up under the Winding\u2011up Act R.S.C. 1952, c. 296. Clarkson Company Limited was appointed provisional liquidator on December 13, 1966 (later confirmed as permanent liquidator). On December 19, 1966, the following order was made respecting the deposit which Wentworth Insurance Company had been required to put up as a condition of being licenced to do business in Ontario:\nUPON the application of counsel on behalf of the Superintendent of Insurance, in the presence of counsel for The Clarkson Company Limited, Provisional Liquidator of Wentworth Insurance Company under The Winding-Up Act, R.S.C. 1952, Chapter 296, upon reading the affidavit of Cecil Richards, the consent of The Clarkson Company Limited to act as receiver to administer the deposit of Wentworth Insurance Company under the said Insurance Act and the consent of the said Provisional Liquidator through its solicitors, filed, and upon hearing what was alleged by counsel aforesaid,\n1. IT IS ORDERED that the deposit of securities deposited by Wentworth Insurance Company pursuant to Section 41 of the said Insurance Act with the Minister, as denned by the said Act, be administered pursuant to the provisions of the said Act.\n2. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that The Clarkson Company Limited be and is hereby appointed receiver to administer the said deposit pursuant to the said Act.\n3. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that The Clarkson Company Limited be and is hereby authorized to exercise in respect of the \u2018account of the insurer all or any of the powers that the Master of the Supreme Court would have if he were taking an account of the claims against the said deposit.\n4. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that The Clarkson Company Limited be and is hereby authorized to sell or realize upon bank deposit receipts in the aggregate sum of approximately $60,000.00 comprising part of the said deposit.\n5. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this matter be and is hereby referred to the Master at Toronto to give such further directions or advice pertaining to any matter arising in the administration of the deposit as may be necessary from time to time and that the said Master be and is hereby conferred with all the powers conferred upon the Court by the said Insurance Act in and about the administration of the said deposit, passing the accounts of the said receiver, approving the accounts and discharging the said receiver.\n6. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all the above provisions of this order be without prejudice to the rights of The Provisional Liquidator and The Permanent Liquidator, or either of them of Wentworth Insurance Company appointed under The Winding-Up Act, R.S.C. 1952, Chapter 296 and in particular Section 165 thereof.\n7. AND IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the costs of this application be taxed and paid to the applicant and to the said Provisional Liquidator out of the said deposit.\nOn July 14, 1967, an application was made to the Master for advice and direction of the Court as to the manner in which the deposit under s. 41 of The Insurance Act in the hands of the Liquidator was to be administered, whether Under The Insurance Act, or as a general asset of the company under the Winding-up Act. On this application counsellor the Attorney General for Canada submitted that the provisions of The Insurance Act respecting the administration of the deposit were legislation relating to insolvency and ultra vires Ontario.\nThe Master directed the Liquidator to deal with the deposit in the manner provided by sections 58 and 59 of The Insurance Act. An appeal was taken to Hartt J., who upheld the Master and ordered insofar as is relevant here, as follows:\n2. AND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER that The Clarkson Company Limited, Permanent Liquidator of Wentworth Insurance Company, do administer the funds and securities deposited pursuant to the provisions of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1960, Chapter 190, in the manner provided by Sections 58 and 59 of the said Insurance Act.\nThe Policyholders entitled to claim for refunds of unearned premiums appealed to the Court of Appeal and that Court allowed the appeal and ordered:\n2. AND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER that The Clarkson Company Limited, Permanent Liquidator of Wentworth Insurance Company, do administer the funds and securities deposited pursuant to the provisions of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1960, Chapter 190, in the manner provided by The Winding-up Act, R.S.C. 1952, Chapter 296.\nThe effect of this order was to require distribution of the deposit as set out in s. 162 of The Winding-up Act.\nLaskin J.A., writing for the Court, said in his reasons:\nIt was contended that where on a winding-up under the federal Act by reason of insolvency (which is the present case) securities are on deposit with the Minister, they are not assets of the insolvent company administrable under the federal Act. If the matter rested only on the reach of section 33 of the federal Act, previously mentioned, or on the stark question whether the securities were property of the insolvent company at the time of insolvency the argument would be a formidable one. But it fails to take account of what to me are the plain words of section 165(1).\nand\nHaving regard to the making of a winding up order by reason of insolvency of the Wentworth Insurance Company, I would, as a matter of construction of the Ontario Insurance Act, hold that Act inapplicable to govern the distribution of the deposit in view of the order made under section 165(1) of the Winding-up Act. In so far as the Ontario provisions purport to provide a scheme of distribution upon insolvency, they are invalid per se. In any event, they are overborne by the Winding-up Act and especially by sections 162 and 165(1) with which they cannot be compatibly administered.\nWith respect, I cannot agree. In my view, sections 58 and 59 of The Insurance Act are, in pith and substance, valid provincial legislation and further, that s. 165(1) of the Winding-up Act is ultra vires Parliament; an intrusion into a field of legislative power reserved exclusively to the provinces.\nThe present case is another in the series of decisions in litigation between the Federal authority and the provinces involving insurance and in every case without exception the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces as to the conduct of the business of insurance has been upheld by the Courts. Insurance is defined by The Insurance Act 1960, R.S.O. c. 190, as follows:\n1. (31) \u201cinsurance\u201d means the undertaking by one person to indemnify another person against loss or liability for loss in respect of a certain risk or peril to which the object of the insurance may be exposed, or to pay a sum of money or other thing of value upon the happening of a certain event;\nThis is the definition used by all provinces which have adopted the uniform approach, being all ten provinces except Quebec and Newfoundland.\nIt is accordingly of the essence of insurance that when an eventuality occurs which entitles the insured to indemnity that there be in existence a fund or assets in the hands of someone from which the indemnity will be forthcoming, otherwise the insurance may be no more than a delusion. The deposit feature of the several insurance acts, including the Ontario Act, thus became an integral part of the whole scheme of insurance. To deny access to that deposit to the very persons for whose protection it was established at the time when they need it most is to destroy one of the fundamentals of insurance protection in Ontario.\nThe deposit is the day to day assurance to insureds who, having no means of their own to evaluate the reliability of insurers, are given that assurance by the provisions of The Insurance Act which require the deposit as a condition of being permitted to do business in Ontario. Accordingly an insured in Ontario buys insurance with the knowledge that he will be indemnified if he has a valid claim; in other words that the umbrella will be there if and when it rains; i.e. when any of the eventualities set out in s. 51(2) occur.\nIn these circumstances, how can it be said that The Ontario Insurance Act in requiring the deposit and administering it if need be for any of the reasons stated in s. 48 is in pith and substance other than valid insurance legislation? The pith and substance test of legislative validity has been recognized as the most valid test in determining whether legislation of the Dominion or of a province is intra vires or ultra vires and particularly so in the much traversed field of insurance law in Canada. The leading case in this respect would appear to be Attorney-General for Ontario v. Reciprocal Insurers[8]. The Judgment of their Lordships in that case was delivered by Duff J. (later C.J.C.) sitting as a member of the Privy Council. He said at pp. 336 to 338:\nIn Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for Alberta (1916) 1 A.C. 588, it was decided by this Board that it was not competent to the Dominion to regulate generally the business of insurance in such a way as to interfere with the exercise of civil rights in the Provinces.\nThe provisions relating to licences in the Insurance Act of 1910, which by this judgment was declared to be ultra vires, and the regulations governing licences under the Act and applicable to contracts and to the business of insurance, did not, in any respect presently material, substantially differ from those now found in the legislation of 1917; but the provisions of the statute of 1910 derived their coercive force from penalties created by the Insurance Act itself.\nThe distinction between the legislation of 1910 and that of 1917, upon which the major contention of the Dominion is founded, consists in the fact that s. 508c is enacted in the form of an amendment to the statutory criminal law, and purports only to create offences which are declared to be indictable, and to ordain penalties for such offences. The question now to be decided is whether, in the frame in which this legislation of 1917 is cast, that part of it which is so enacted can receive effect as a lawful exercise of the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada in relation to the criminal law. It has been formally laid down in judgments of this Board, that in such an inquiry the Courts must ascertain the \u201ctrue nature and character\u201d of the enactment: Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons (1881) 7 App. Cas. 96; its \u201cpith and substance\u201d: Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden (1899) A.C. 580; and it is the result of this investigation, not the form alone, which the statute may have assumed under the hand of the draughtsman, that will determine within which of the categories of subject matters mentioned in ss. 91 and 92 the legislation falls; and for this purpose the legislation must be \u201cscrutinised in its entirety\u201d: \u201cGreat West Saddlery Co. v. The King (1921) 2 A.C. 91, 117. Of course, where there is an absolute jurisdiction vested in a Legislature, the laws promulgated by it must take effect according to the proper construction of the language in which they are expressed. But where the law-making authority is of a limited or qualified character, obviously it may be necessary to examine with some strictness the substance of the legislation for the purpose of determining what it is that the Legislature is really doing. Upon this principle the Board proceeded in 1878, in Attorney-General for Quebec v. Queen Insurance Co. (1878) 3 App. Cas. 1090, where a statute of Quebec (39 Vict. c. 7), which took the form of a licensing Act, enacted under the authority of s. 92, head 9, of the British North America Act, was held to be in its true character a Stamp Act and an attempt to impose a tax which was an indirect tax, in contravention of the limitation to which the Provincial powers of taxation are subject under the second head of that section. The principle is recognized in Russell v. The Queen (1882) 7 App. Cas. 829, and in Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons 7 App. Cas. 96, and in 1899, conformably to this doctrine, it was held, in the well-known case of Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden (1899) A.C. 580, that a statutory regulation, professedly passed for governing the working of coal mines, which admittedly \u201cmight be regarded as establishing a regulation applicable\u201d to the working of such mines, and which, \u201cif that, were an exclusive description of the substance of it,\u201d was \u201cwithin the competency of the Provincial Legislature by virtue either of s. 92, No. 10, or s. 92, No. 13,\u201d must be classed, its \u201ctrue character,\u201d its \u201cpith and substance\u201d being ascertained, as legislation in relation to the subject of \u201caliens and naturalisation,\u201d a subject exclusively within the Dominion sphere of action. The general doctrine was later applied in John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton (1915) A.C. 330, and again in Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King (1921) 2 A.C. 91, 117.\nand at p. 340:\nThe power which this argument attributes to the Dominion, is, of course, a far-reaching one. Indeed, the claim now advanced is nothing less than this, that the Parliament of Canada can assume exclusive control over the exercise of any class of civil rights within the Provinces, in respect of which exclusive jurisdiction is given to the Provinces under s. 92, by the device of declaring those persons to be guilty of a criminal offence who in the exercise of such rights do not observe the conditions imposed by the Dominion. Obviously the principle contended for ascribes to the Dominion the power, in execution of its authority under s. 91, head 27, to promulgate and to enforce regulations controlling such matters as, for example, the solemnization of marriage, the practice of the learned professions and other occupations, municipal institutions, the operation of local works and undertakings, the incorporation of companies with exclusively Provincial objects\u2014and superseding Provincial authority in relation thereto. Indeed, it would be difficult to assign limits to the measure in which, by a procedure strictly analogous to that followed in this instance, the Dominion might dictate the working of Provincial institutions, and circumscribe or supersede the legislative and administrative authority of the Provinces.\nSuch a procedure cannot, their Lordships think, be justified, consistently with the governing principles of the Canadian Constitution, as enunciated and established by the judgments of this Board.\nand again at pp. 342-3:\nIn accordance with the principle inherent in these decisions their Lordships think it is no longer open to dispute that the Parliament of Canada cannot, by purporting to create penal sanctions under s. 91, head 27, appropriate to itself exclusively a field of jurisdiction in which, apart from such a procedure, it could exert no legal authority, and that if, when examined as a whole, legislation in form criminal is found, in aspects and for purposes exclusively within the Provincial sphere, to deal with matters committed to the Provinces, it cannot be upheld as valid. And indeed, to hold otherwise would be incompatible with an essential principle of the Confederation scheme, the object of which, as Lord Watson said in Maritime Bank of Canada v. Receiver-General of New Brunswick (1892) A.C.437, 441, was \u201cnot to weld the Provinces into one or to subordinate the Provincial Governments to a central authority.\u201d \u201cWithin the spheres allotted to them by the Act of the Dominion and the Provinces are,\u201d as Lord Haldane said in Great West Saddlery Co. v. The King (1921) 2 A.C. 91, 100, \u201crendered in general principle co\u2011ordinate Governments.\u201d\nHaving the power to require the deposit as a condition of granting a licence (and that power is expressly conceded by the respondents and by the Attorney General for Canada) for no one challenges the validity of sections 41 and 42 of The Insurance Act of Ontario, the power to administer the deposit follows as a necessary consequence. This argument was recognized as sound as long ago as 1880 where, in The Queen Insurance Company v. Parsons[9], Ritchie C.J. said:\nHow can this be said to be an interference with the general regulation of trade and commerce? Yet it deals as effectually with the matter or contract of insurance in these particulars as this Act does in reference to the matters with which it deals. If the Legislative power of the provincial legislatures is to be restricted and limited, as it is claimed it should be, and the doctrine contended for in this case, as I understand it, is carried to its legitimate logical conclusion, the idea of the power of the local legislature to deal with the local works and undertakings, property and civil rights, and matters of a merely local and private nature in the province is, I humbly think, to a very great extent, illusory.\nI scarcely know how one could better illustrate the exercise of power to the local legislature to legislate with reference to property and civil rights, and matters of a merely local and private nature, than by a local Act of incorporation, whereby a right to hold or deal with real or personal property in a province is granted, and whereby the civil right to contract and sue and to be sued as an individual in reference thereto is also granted. If a legislature possesses this power, as a necessary sequence, it must have the right to limit and control the manner in which the property may be so dealt with, and as to the contracts in reference thereto the terms and conditions on which they may be entered into, whether they may be verbal, or shall be in writing, whether they shall contain conditions for the protection or security of one or other or both the parties, or that they may be free to deal as may be agreed on by the contracting parties without limit or restriction.\nInasmuch, then, as this Act relates to property in Ontario, and the subject-matter dealt with is therefor local, and as the contract between the parties is of a strictly private nature, and as the matters thus dealt with are therefore, in the words of the British North America Act, \u201cof a merely local and private nature in the province,\u201d and as contracts are matters of civil rights and breaches thereof are civil wrongs, and as the property and civil rights in the province only are dealt with by the Act, and as \u201cproperty and civil rights in the provinces\u201d are in the enumeration of the \u201cexclusive powers of provincial legislatures,\u201d I am of opinion that the legislature of Ontario, in dealing with these matters in the Act in question, did not exceed their legislative powers. I am happy to say I can foresee, and I fear, no evil effects whatever, as has been suggested, as likely to result to the Dominion from this view of the case. On the contrary, I believe that while this decision \u201crecognizes and sustains the legislative control of the Dominion parliament over all matters confided to its legislative jurisdiction, it, at the same time, preserves to the local legislatures those rights and powers conferred on them by the B.N A. Act, and which a contrary decision would, in my opinion, in effect, substantially, or to a very large extent, sweep away.\nSimilarly, Lord Atkin in Ladore v. Bennett[10], said:\nBut in the present case nothing has emerged even to suggest that the Legislature of Ontario at the respective dates had any purpose in view other than to legislate in times of difficulty in relation to the class of subject which was its special care\u2014namely, municipal institutions. For the reasons given the attack upon the Acts and scheme on the ground either that they infringe the Dominion\u2019s exclusive power relating to bankruptcy and insolvency, or that the deal with civil rights outside the Province, breaks down. The statutes are not directed to insolvency legislation; they pick out insolvency as one reason for dealing in a particular way with unsuccessful institutions; and though they affect rights outside the Province they only so affect them collaterally, as a necessary incident to their lawful powers of good government within the Province. (emphasis added)\nAnd in this Court in the case of Attorney-General for Ontario v. Barfried Enterprises Ltd[11], Judson J. said:\nThe issue in this appeal is to determine the true nature and character of the Act in question and, in particular, of s. 2 above quoted. The Act deals with rights arising from contract and is prima facie legislation in relation to civil rights and, as such, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the province under s. 92(13). Is it removed from the exclusive provincial legislative jurisdiction by s. 91(19) of the Act, which assigns jurisdiction over interest to the federal authority? In my opinion, it is not legislation in relation to interest but legislation relating to annulment or reformation of contract on the grounds set out in the Act, namely, (a) that the cost of the loan is excessive, and (b) that the transaction is harsh and unconscionable. The wording of the statute indicates that it is not the rate or amount of interest which is the concern of the legislation but whether the transaction as a whole is one to which it would be proper to maintain as having been freely consented to by the debtor. If one looks at it from the point of view of English law it might be classified as an extension of the doctrine of undue influence. As pointed out by the Attorney General for Quebec, if one looks at it from the point of view of the civil law, it can be classified as an extension of the doctrine of lesion dealt with in articles 1001 and 1012 of the Civil Code. The theory of the legislation is that the Court is enabled to relieve a debtor, at least in part, of the obligations of a contract to which in all the circumstances of the case he cannot be said to have given a free and valid consent. The fact that interference with such a contract may involve interference with interest as one of the constituent elements of the contract is incidental. And Cartwright J., as he then was, said at page 579:\nThe Unconscionable Transactions Relief Act appears to me to be legislation in relation to Property and Civil Rights in the Province and the Administration of Justice in the Province, rather than legislation in relation to Interest. Its primary purpose and effect are to enlarge the equitable jurisdiction to give relief against harsh and unconscionable bargains which the courts have long exercised; it affects, but only incidentally, the subject-matter of Interest, specified in head 19 of s. 91 of the British North America Act.\nRegarding the validity of s. 165(1) of the Winding-up Act, which reads:\n165. (1) The funds and securities of the company in Canada that may be on deposit with any government in Canada or with trustees or otherwise held for the company or for the protection of the policyholders of the company of the class or classes that are affected by the winding-up order shall, on order of the court having jurisdiction, be transferred to the liquidator.\n(2) Where the company is a Canadian company that has deposited with the government of any state or country outside of Canada, or with any trustee or other person in such state or country, any of its funds or securities for the protection of the company\u2019s policyholders in such state or country, the liquidator may request such government trustee or other person to transfer to him the said funds and securities and on such transfer being made, the said funds and securities shall be used for the benefit of all the company\u2019s policyholders in the same manner as any other assets of the company.\n(3) Where the said government, trustee or other person does not transfer the said funds and securities within such period commencing with the date of the liquidator\u2019s request therefor as the Court may fix, the policyholders of the company, for whose protection the said deposit was made, shall be deemed to have refused the reinsurance, if any, arranged by the liquidator, and, whether reinsurance has been arranged or not, to have forfeited all right and claim to any share of the assets of the company other than the funds or securities so deposited for their protection outside of Canada.\nit is significant to note that Parliament tried unsuccessfully to regulate the conduct of the insurance business in Canada by enacting that all insurers must obtain a licence. The device employed was by purporting to make it an offence under the Criminal Code for any insurer to do business without a Dominion Licence. The field of criminal law is unquestionably in the exclusive competence of Parliament just as is bankruptcy and insolvency under s. 91 of the British North America Act. The Privy Council struck down that attempt in the Reciprocal Insurers case previously referred to. The next attempt was by the Insurance Act of Canada, R.S.C. 1917, c. 29. Sections 11 and 12 of the Insurance Act of Canada read:\n11. It shall not be lawful for (a) any Canadian company; or (b) any alien, whether a natural person or a foreign company, within Canada to solicit or accept any risk, or to issue or deliver any receipt or policy of insurance, or to grant, in consideration of any premium or payment, any annuity on a life or lives, or to collect or receive any premium, or, except as provided in section one hundred and twenty-nine of this Act, to inspect any risk or adjust any loss, or to advertise for or carry on any business of insurance, or to prosecute or maintain any suit action or proceeding, or to file any claim in insolvency relating to such business, unless under a licence from the Minister granted pursuant to the provisions of this Act.\n12. (1) It shall not be lawful for any British company, or for any British subject not resident in Canada, to immigrate into Canada for the purpose of opening or establishing any office or agency for the transaction of any business of or relating to insurance, or of soliciting or accepting any risk or issuing or delivering any interim receipt or policy or insurance, or granting, in consideration of any premium or payment, any annuity on a life or lives, or of collecting or receiving any premium, or except as provided in section one hundred and twenty-nine of this Act, of inspecting any risk or adjusting any loss, or of carrying on any business of or relating to insurance, or of prosecuting or maintaining any suit, action or proceeding or filing any claim in insolvency relating to such business, unless under a licence from the Minister granted pursuant to the provisions of this Act.\n(2) A company shall be deemed to immigrate into Canada within the meaning of this section if it sends into Canada any document appointing or otherwise appoints any person in Canada its agent for any of the purposes mentioned in subsection one of this section.\nSections 65 and 66 of the same act prescribed penalties for contravention of sections 11 and 12. The validity of these provisions were dealt with by the Privy Council in the case of In Re Insurance Act of Canada[12]. The judgment of the Privy Council was delivered by Viscount Dunedin, who said:\nIt is not in their Lordship\u2019s opinion necessary for them, as it was for the judges in the Courts below, to examine in detail the various cases that have arisen in the Canadian Courts. They think that the questions raised can be conclusively dealt with in the light of four cases which have reached this Board. These are in chronological order: Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons (1881) 7 App. Cas. 96; John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton (1915) A.C. 330; Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney-General far Alberta (1916) 1 A.C. 588; and Attorney-General for Ontario v. Reciprocal Insurers (1924) A.C. 328.\nThe case of the Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons (1881) 7 App. Cas. 96, was not fought directly between the Dominion and the Provinces, either as parties or inteveners. It was an action by a private individual to recover money under an insurance contract for a loss by fire. The defence was non\u2011compliance on the part of the insured with certain statutory conditions imposed by a Provincial Ontario Act and applicable to insurers, to which the answer was made that the provisions were ultra vires as trespassing on the province of Dominion legislation. It was held that the conditions were not ultra vires, and the defence was good. The arguments turned on what may be called the competing claims of ss. 91 and 92 of the British North America Act. The principle laid down was clear. It is within the power of the Dominion legislature to create the person of a company and endow it with powers to carry on a certain class of business to wit, insurance; and nothing that the Provinces can do by legislation can interfere with the status so created; but none the less the Provinces can by legislation prescribe the way in which insurance business or any other business shall be carried on in the Provinces. The great point of the case is the clear distinction drawn between the question of the status of a company and the way in which the business of the company shall be carried on. This distinction was clearly acted on in the next case, which was not an insurance case.\nJohn Deere Plow Co.\u2019s case (1915) A.C. 330; related to a company incorporated under Dominion legislation to carry on the business of trading in agricultural implements throughout Canada. The Parliament of British Columbia sought means to restrain any such trade by enacting that the trader should have no power to sue unless he had obtained a licence to trade from the Provincial authorities. It was held that this was ultra vires of the Province, as being an attempt to interfere with the status of the company.\nThen came the case of Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for Alberta (1916) 1 A.C. 588; this was the first direct trial of strength between a Province and the Dominion. By s. 4 of the Dominion Insurance Act of 1910 it was provided that no company or person should do insurance business unless they had received a Dominion license so to act. This provision was fortified by a penalty for contravention under s. 70. Two questions were put to the Court: (1) Are ss. 4 and 70 of the Act or any part thereof ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada? (2) Does s. 4 operate to prohibit a foreign company carrying on business without a licence even though its business is confined to one Province?\nThe Board answered the first question in the affirmative. Here again the arguments turned on the competing claims of ss. 91 and 92, and the decision on this question conclusively and finally settled that regulations as to the carrying on of insurance business were a Provincial and not a Dominion matter. It really only carried to their logical conclusion the two cases already cited.\nAs to the second question, Lord Haldane said: (1916) 1 A.C. 588, 597: \u201cThe second question is, in substance, whether the Dominion Parliament has jurisdiction to require a foreign company to take out a licence from the Dominion Minister, even in a case where the company desires to carry on its business only within the limits of a single province. To this question their Lordships\u2019 reply is that in such a case it would be within the power of the Parliament of Canada, by properly framed legislation, to impose such a restriction. It appears to them that such a power is given by the heads in s. 91, which refer to the regulation of trade and commerce and to aliens. This question also is therefore answered in the affirmative.\u201d\nThe first question in the present appeal really turns upon whether the sections impugned fall within the sentence of the Board just quoted. But before discussing this it will be well to examine the remaining case mentioned\u2014namely, the Reciprocal Insurers\u2019 case (1924) A.C. 328. After the decision against them on the first question in the last case in 1916, the Dominion legislation on this subject was altered. A new Act was passed in 1917. In place of the old s. 4, which had been declared ultra vires by the decision, there were now enacted ss. 11 and 12 in these terms:\u2014(See ss. 11 and 12 previously quoted)\nContravention of these provisions was dealt with by sections imposing penalties. But besides that, there had been inserted in the Criminal Code two new sections, 508C and 508D, which constituted as a criminal offence the doing of insurance business without a Dominion license. Meantime Ontario had passed an Act dealing with mutual insurance. This led to the case in which the questions proposed were as follows: (1) Is it within the legislative competence of the legislature of the Province of Ontario to regulate or license the making of reciprocal contracts by such legislation as that embodied in the Reciprocal Insurance Act, 1922? (2) Would the making or carrying out of reciprocal insurance contracts licensed pursuant to the Reciprocal Insurance Act, 1922, be rendered illegal or otherwise affected by the provisions of ss. 508C and 508D of the Criminal Code as enacted by c. 26 of the Statutes of Canada 7 and 8 Geo. 5 in the absence of a license from the Minister of Finance issued pursuant to s. 4 of the Insurance Act of Canada, 7 & 8 Geo. 5, c. 29? (3) Would the answers to questions 1 or 2 be affected, and if so, how, if one or more of the persons subscribing to such Reciprocal Insurance contracts is: (a) a British subject not resident in Canada immigrating into Canada? (b) an alien?\nMr. Justice Duff, who delivered the judgment of the Board, expressed himself thus (1): \u201cThe provisions relating to licenses in the Insurance Act of 1910, which\u201d (by the judgment of 1916) \u201cwas declared to be ultra vires, and the regulations governing licenses under the Act and applicable to contracts and to the business of insurance, did not, in any respect presently material, substantially differ from those now found in the legislation of 1917; but the provisions of the statute of 1910 derived their coercive force from penalties created by the Insurance Act itself. The distinction between the legislation of 1910 and that of 1917, upon which the major contention of the Dominion is founded, consists in the fact that s. 508C is enacted in the form of an amendment to the statutory criminal law, and purports only to create offences which are declared to be indictable, and to ordain penalties for such offences. The question now to be decided is whether in the frame in which this legislation of 1917 is cast, that part of it which is so enacted can receive effect as a lawful exercise of the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada in relation to the criminal law. It has been formally laid down in judgments of this Board, that in such an inquiry the Courts must ascertain \u2018the true nature and character\u2019 of the enactment: Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons 7 App. Cas. 96; its \u2018pith and substance\u2019: Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden (1899) A.C. 580\u2026\u201d\nThe Board proceeded to decide that the amendment of the criminal law by s. 508C was not a genuine amendment of the criminal law, but was really an attempt by a soi-disant amendment of the criminal law to subject insurance business in the Province to the control of the Dominion, that which had exactly been determined to be ultra vires by the judgment of 1916. This decided the main question.\nAs regards question 3, it was answered in the negative, but there was added the following addendum: \u201cTheir Lordships do not express any opinion as to the competence of the Dominion Parliament, by virtue of its authority in relation to aliens and to trade and commerce, to enact ss. 11 and 12, sub-s. 1, of the Insurance Act. This, although referred to on the argument before their Lordships\u2019 Board, was not fully discussed, and since it is not directly raised by the question submitted, their Lordships, as they then intimated, considered it inadvisable to express any opinion upon it. Their Lordships think it sufficient to recall the observation of Lord Haldane, in delivering the judgment of the Board, in Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney\u2011General for Alberta (1916) 1 A.C. 588, to the effect that legislation, if properly framed, requiring aliens, whether natural persons or foreign companies, to become licensed, as a condition of carrying on the business of insurance in Canada, might be competently enacted by Parliament.\u201d\nFollowing on this judgment, the Dominion Parliament, by an amending statute in 1924, repealed sub-s. 2 of s. 12 of the Act of 1917. The Act of 1927, which is the Act with which the present case has to do, reproduces, as has been seen, ss. 11 and 12 and the corresponding penal sections renumbered as 66 and 67, and in the Criminal Code of 1927 the old 508C reappears as 507, but with an exception as to reciprocal insurance companies so as to avoid the direct result of the judgment of 1924.\nTheir Lordships are now in a position to address themselves directly to the first question in this case. It is clear from the quotations from the Reciprocal Insurers\u2019 case (1924) A.C. 328, that the question is technically still open, and it is clear from the judgment in the 1916 case that the sections in question can only be justified if to them can be applied what was there said by Lord Haldane in his answer to query 2. Their Lordships will repeat it: \u201cTo this question their Lordships\u2019 reply is that in such a case it would be within the power of the Parliament of Canada, by properly framed legislation, to impose such a restriction. It appears to them that such a power is given by the heads in s. 91, which refer to the regulation of trade and commerce and to aliens.\u201d\nThe state of opinion in the Court below was as follows: Two learned judges thought that the sections were ultra vires, whether applied, to British or to foreign insurers; but three judges, while holding the sections ultra vires as to British subjects, held that they were intra vires as to aliens. Now so far as British subjects were concerned the view was that Lord Haldane\u2019s dictum showed clearly that the only power of restriction given rested upon its being possible to connect it with alien legislation, and that therefore it was impossible to bring British subjects within the scope of the dictum. So far as this argument goes, their Lordships think it is sound, but at the same time they think it unnecessary because they think it is swallowed up in the wider consideration which makes the sections bad as regards both aliens and British subjects. Their Lordships consider that although the question was studiously kept open in the Reciprocal Insurers\u2019 case (1924) A.C. 328, it was really decided by what was then laid down. The case decided that a colourable use of the Criminal Code could not serve to disguise the real object of the legislation, which was to dominate the exercise of the business of insurance. And in the same way it was decided that to try by a false definition to pray in aid s. 95 of the British North America Act, 1867, which deals with immigration, in order to control the business of insurance, was equally unavailing. What has got to be considered is whether this is in a true sense of the word alien legislation, and that is what Lord Haldane meant by \u201cproperly framed legislation.\u201d Their Lordships have no doubt that the Dominion Parliament might pass an Act forbidding aliens to enter Canada or forbidding them so to enter to engage in any business without a license, and further they might furnish rules for their conduct while in Canada, requiring them, e.g., to report at stated intervals. But the sections here are not of that sort, they do not deal with the position of an alien as such: but under the guise of legislation as to aliens they seek to intermeddle with the conduct of insurance business, a business which by the first branch of the 1916 case has-been declared to be exclusively subject to Provincial law. Their Lordships have therefore, no hesitation in declaring that this is not \u201cproperly framed\u201d alien legislation.\nAs regards British subjects, who cannot be styled aliens, once the false definition is gone, the same remark applies as to alien immigrants. This is not properly framed law as to immigration, but an attempt to saddle British immigrants with a different code as to the conduct of insurance business from the code which has been settled to be the only valid code, i.e., the Provincial Code.\nAnd regarding the claim that Parliament had a right to provide by section 16 of the Special War Revenue Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 179 that:\n\u201c(16) Every person resident in Canada, who insures his property situate in Canada, or any property situate in Canada in which he has an insurable interest, other than that of an insurer of such property, against risks other than marine risks: (a) with any British or foreign company or British or foreign underwriter or underwriters, not licensed under the provisions of the Insurance Act, to transact business in Canada; or (b) with any association of persons formed for the purpose of exchanging reciprocal contracts of indemnity upon the plan known as interinsurance and not licensed under the provisions of the Insurance Act, the chief place of business of which association or of its principal attorney-in-fact is situate outside of Canada; shall on or before the thirty-first day of December in each year pay to the Minister, in addition to any other tax payable under any existing law or statute a tax of five per centum of the total net cost to such person of all such insurance for the preceding calendar year.\u201d\nViscount Dunedin said:\nNow as to the power of the Dominion Parliament to impose taxation there is no doubt. But if the tax as imposed is linked up with an object which is illegal the tax for that purpose must fall. Sect. 16 clearly assumes that a Dominion license to prosecute insurance business is a valid license all over Canada and carries with it the right to transact insurance business. But it has been already decided that this is not so; that a Dominion license so far as authorizing transactions of insurance business in a Province is concerned, is an idle piece of paper conferring no rights which the party transacting in accordance with Provincial legislation has not already got, if he has complied with Provincial requirements. It is really the same old attempt in another way. (emphasis added)\nTheir Lordships cannot do better than quote and then paraphrase a portion of the words of Duff J. in the Reciprocal Insurers\u2019 case (1924) A.C. 328, 342. He says: \u201cIn accordance with the principle inherent in these decisions their Lordships think it is no longer open to dispute that the Parliament of Canada cannot, by purporting to create penal sanctions under s. 91, head 27, appropriate to itself exclusively a field of jurisdiction in which, apart from such a procedure, it could exert no legal authority, and that if, when examined as a whole, legislation in form criminal is found, in aspects and for purposes exclusively within the Provincial sphere, to deal with matters committed to the Provinces, it cannot be upheld as valid.\u201d If instead of the words \u201ccreate penal sanctions under s. 91, head 27\u201d you substitute the words \u201cexercise taxation powers under s. 91, head 3,\u201d and for the word \u201cCriminal\u201d substitute \u201ctaxing\u201d, the sentence expresses precisely their Lordships\u2019 views.\nIt was after this decision in the Insurance Act of Canada case that s. 165(1) of the Winding-up Act was enacted. This would appear to be the last attempt by Parliament to control a facet of insurance operations by purporting to do so through legislation dealing with insolvency. Bankruptcy and insolvency is, by head 21 of s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act within the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament. This is not questioned any more than criminal law was within the jurisdiction of Parliament in the Reciprocal Insurers\u2019 case or that immigration was in the case of In Re Insurance Act of Canada, or interest in the Barfried case, or bankruptcy and insolvency in Ladore v. Bennett.\nIt is not the fact that bankruptcy and insolvency is within the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament that is vital to the question here, but rather that Parliament, by enacting s. 165(1), sought again to intrude into a field of legislation, namely insurance, which by virtue of s. 92, and the cases previously referred to, is committed exclusively to the jurisdiction of the Provinces.\nSections 40 to 73 of The Insurance Act of Ontario as well as ss. 225 to 240 of Part VI of The Corporations Act respecting Insurance Corporations are part and parcel of the law of Ontario respecting insurance, and the relevant sections, insofar as they relate to the administration of a deposit, deal with bankruptcy and insolvency only as incidental to the right to legislate regarding insurance.\nThe effect of s. 165(1) of the Winding-up Act and of s. 162 of the same Act is to make available to all creditors of an insolvent insurance company the deposit which the Province has required for the protection of policyholders in Ontario for a number of reasons. The requirement that the deposit be handed over to the liquidator may be in itself innocuous. It is the fact that once it is in his hands the liquidator must distribute the deposit as provided in s. 162 of the Winding-up Act. This means a distribution different from that called for in s. 48 of The Insurance Act. The liquidator under the Winding-up Act and the receiver under s. 52(1) of The Insurance Act may, by s. 52(2), be the same person. I see nothing repugnant in this procedure. It is the manner in which the deposit is to be administered that is the vital issue here, not by whom it is to be distributed. Parliament has chosen by the seemingly innocuous direction in s. 165(1) of the Winding-up Act to divert the deposit from its true purpose to a purpose wholly repugnant to the intent of the Legislature of Ontario which, in providing for the deposit, did so for the protection of policyholders as set out in s. 48.\nWith deference to contrary opinion, the contention that there is no room for any suggestion that s. 165(1) is merely colourable ignores, I think, the history of Parliament\u2019s attempts to invade the field of insurance legislation following upon the decision in Citizens Insurance v. Parsons[13]. Having attempted to invade the insurance field:\n(a) Through the licensing requirement door (Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General for Alberta[14]);\n(b) Through the criminal law door (The Reciprocal Insurers case[15]);\n(c) Through the immigration door (In Re Insurance Act of Canada[16]);\nand having been repulsed on these three attempts, Parliament then chose immediately after the Insurance Act of Canada decision in 1932 to gain entry through another door by s. 165(1) which is not a section dealing with bankruptcy and insolvency generally but one of limited application specifically aimed at insurance companies only. It must be seen as an attempt to make that which is not an asset of an insolvent insurance company into an asset by some sort of legislative transmutation.\nSurely it cannot be said that this is valid Dominion legislation. It is patently a foray into the field of insurance, an area forbidden to Parliament. It is colourable legislation and, because of this, ultra vires. It ignores completely that by s. 41(5) the deposit is vested in the Minister. There can be no legislative divesting of the deposit under the guise of bankruptcy and insolvency. The effective answer, it appears to me, is that s. 165(1) attempted to deal with something which is not an asset of the bankrupt by purporting to say that it is. The deposit is vested in the Minister (The Attorney General of Ontario) to be held by him under s. 48(2) \u201c\u2026for the benefit of all insured persons under Ontario contracts\u2026\u201d\nThe case of Royal Bank of Canada v. Larue[17], was cited as supporting the proposition that bankruptcy legislation enacted by Parliament took precedence over the provisions of Art. 2121 of the Civil Code of Quebec regarding the priority of a judicial hypothec upon real assets of a debtor in that province. It was held that it was within the powers of the Parliament of Canada to enact, in relation to bankruptcy and insolvency, the relative priorities of creditors under a bankruptcy or authorized assignment. That proposition is not questioned, but it is not relevant here. The Bankruptcy Act is general bankruptcy legislation validly enacted under Head 21 of s. 91 of the British North America Act.\nLarue (Viscount Cave L.C. at p. 197) recognizes that an execution creditor who has realized upon his execution and become satisfied by payment is not affected by a receiving order. In other words, the asset which has been realized upon or the proceeds therefrom are not regarded as belonging to the bankrupt. A fortiori an asset which is not the property of the insurance company but is vested in the Minister who can deal with it independently of the company is necessarily beyond the reach of the receiver.\nSection 165(1) of the Winding-up Act is not a case of a general provision applying to all bankruptcies and insolvencies. It is a section specifically aimed at deposits put up by insurance companies as a condition of being licensed to do business in the Province by which that deposit vested in the Minister is sought to be translated into an asset of the insolvent insurance company and the title of the Minister to the deposit so vested in him is extinguished. Larue dealt with the rights of creditors inter se to property of the bankrupt and did not purport to make available to creditors an asset which was not the property of the bankrupt at the time of the bankruptcy. The decision of this Court in Provincial Treasurer of Manitoba v. Minister of Finance for Canada[18], is, in my opinion directly applicable to the present case. The facts as set out in the headnote are as follows:\nThe Imperial Canadian Trust Company and the Great West Permanent Loan Company, both having charter power to receive moneys on deposit, were closely associated in management. In 1924, the Loan Company, having decided to discontinue its deposit business, entered into an agreement with the Trust Company whereby the latter took over the deposits of the former on terms set out in the agreement. The amount of deposits so turned over was $124,249.16, and the Loan Company delivered to the Trust Company securities aggregating that amount in estimated value. The Trust Company proceeded from time to time to dispose of these trust assets and to pay depositors and, on December 27th, 1927, had paid off $105,968.87, leaving an unpaid balance of $18,280.29. On that same date, the Trust Company was ordered to be wound up under the Winding-up Act and the Montreal Trust Company was appointed as liquidator. In August, 1929, an immovable property, the only remaining security still undisposed of, was sold by the liquidator for $30,336.65 and the liquidator \u201cset aside and earmarked\u201d, in May, 1930, the above sum of $18,280.29. The liquidator paid out of that sum $8,435.89 to depositors who had filed claims pursuant to an order made by the Master in Chambers, leaving a balance of $9,844.40. The Provincial Treasurer of Manitoba, by an application filed in December, 1937, claimed that sum as bona vacantia, and this is the subject-matter of the first appeal. Then, in April, 1940, the Manitoba legislature passed an Act called the Vacant Property Act, and, in July, 1940, the Attorney-General for Manitoba claimed the same moneys under the provisions of that Act, and this is the subject-matter of the second appeal. The Minister of Finance for Canada contended in both cases that the moneys were the property of the Crown in right of the Dominion as unclaimed dividends under sections 139 and 140 of the Winding-up Act. The appellate court held that the Dominion had jurisdiction over these moneys as part of its jurisdiction over bankruptcy and that its legislation should prevail.\nThis Court held that the judgments in the Manitoba Court should be reversed and directed that the moneys be paid to the Provincial Treasurer for Manitoba under the provisions of The Vacant Property Act. The unanimous judgment of this Court (Rinfret C.J., Davis, Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau JJ.) was delivered by Hudson J. who, after having discussed the facts and the various transactions which resulted in the sum of $9,844.40 being in dispute, said:\nThe fund here in question represents what remains of the securities transferred under the agreement of 1924. That agreement was primarily a contract between the loan company and the trust company to effect a substitution of the latter for the former in relation to the depositors. The agreement, however, incorporated a trust which upon the transfer of the securities to the trust company became an \u201cexecuted\u201d trust, the beneficiaries of which were the depositors. Although these depositors were not parties to the agreement they were interested. The assets transferred by the loan company diminished pro tanto the capacity of that company to pay the depositors and the provision for the trust was for their protection.\nThe language of clause 4 is explicit: the trust company covenants and agrees\n\u201cto earmark and specially set aside the securities which shall be taken over...and to retain them solely and only as security and provision to take care of and pay off the deposits above referred to and said securities shall not fall into or become part of the assets\u201d\nof such party, \u201cbut shall be held and used only as above provided.\u201d When the securities were allocated to the trust company, the trust was irrevocable without the consent of the beneficiaries who thereupon acquired an independent right to enforce the trust.\n* * *\nWhen the order was made for winding-up, the securities undisposed of were held by the trust company as trustee for the unpaid depositors and, as such, they did not form any part of the assets of the estate. See Palmer\u2019s Company Law (Winding-Up) 1937 ed., p. 252 and also p. 672.\n* * *\nIt would appear then that the fund in question is held to fulfil the trust of 1924 and can be treated in no other way.\nIn this view of the matter, sections 139 and 140 of the Winding-Up Act can have no application. The moneys were held by the liquidator as trustee for the individual depositors and not for the trust estate or for anybody else.\nThe Privy Council in Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for the Province of Quebec and Attorneys-General for Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba[19], in referring to Provincial Treasurer of Manitoba v. Minister of Finance for Canada, said:\nIndeed, the Chief Justice would himself have decided in favour of the appellants had he not felt himself constrained by the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Canada in Provincial Treasurer of Manitoba v. Minister of Finance for Canada, (1943) S.C.R. (Can.) 370 to hold otherwise. That case decided that certain trust money in the hands of a trustee which had not been, and some of which could not be, distributed to the cestuis que trustent could not be regarded as bona vacantia, but that it passed to the Province under an Act which provided that: \u201c2. All personal property, including money or securities for money deposited with or held in trust by any person in the province, which remains unclaimed by the person entitled thereto for twelve years from the time when such property, money or securities were first payable shall notwithstanding that the depositee or trustee has delivered or paid or transferred such personal property, money or securities to any other person or official within or without the province as depositee or trustee vest in and be payable to His Majesty in the right of the province of Manitoba subject only to His Majesty\u2019s pleasure with respect to any claim thereafter made by any person claiming to be entitled to such property, money or securities.\u201d The only question in that case material to that which their Lordships are now considering was whether the special Act was in conflict with ss. 139 and 140 of the Winding-up Act of the Dominion Parliament or trenched on the field of bankruptcy and insolvency. It was held that the special Act was not invalidated for either reason. The money in question was not simply a debt\u2014it was trust money\u2014a fund secured on immovable property, and was not an asset of the liquidator in the winding-up but held as trustee for the individual depositors. There was no reason therefore why the Province should not transfer the possession, which the court held to be all that passed, to the Attorney-General for Manitoba as trustee for the depositors, or, indeed, for that matter, to him as bona vacantia. Winding-up and insolvency were not interfered with\u2014only property and civil rights; the sum in dispute being trust money could not be used by the liquidator in the winding\u2011up.\nTo paraphrase Hudson J. in the quotation given above, the deposit in question here was vested in the Minister as trustee for the policyholders in Ontario pursuant to the provisions of The Ontario Insurance Act and not for the Wentworth Insurance Company or for anybody else.\nIt is clear from s. 33 of the Winding-up Act that the property which vests in the liquidator upon his appointment is \u201c\u2026all the property, effects and choses in action to which the company is or appears to be entitled\u2026\u201d, and s. 93 of the Act says that the property of the company is to be applied in satisfaction of its debts and liabilities and the charges, costs and expenses incurred in winding up its affairs. The liquidator, therefore, has no right under the general provisions of the Act to property unless that property is property which comes within the meaning of s. 33. It cannot be said that a deposit vested in the Minister is property to which the company is or appears to be entitled. The deposit is not the property of the company at all although in certain circumstances it may revert to the company, but that is much different from saying that the company is or appears to be entitled to it at the relevant time, namely, at the time of the bankruptcy. It cannot be suggested that immediately prior to the making of the receiving order Wentworth Insurance Company could have maintained an action against the Minister for the return to it of the deposit. The receiver has no greater rights in that respect than the insolvent company. A statement by Lord Atkin in Lymburn v. Mayland[20], where he said:\nThe provisions of this part of the Act may appear to be far-reaching; but if they fall, as their Lordships conceive them to fall, within the scope of legislation dealing with property and civil rights the legislature of the Province, sovereign in this respect, has the sole power and responsibility of determining what degre of protection it will afford to the public.\nis, in my view, very, very apt here. The province has the sole power and responsibility to determine what degree of protection it will stipulate from insurers in favour of insureds in the Province of Ontario.\nI would accordingly allow the appeal and restore the judgment of Hartt J. with costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal dismissed, RITCHIE, HALL, SPENCE and PIGEON JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General for Ontario: F.W.

(Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1969: June 11, 12, 30.\nPresent: Judson, Ritchie, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nInsurance\u2014Automobile\u2014Class action to have proceeds of policy applied in satisfaction of judgments and claims against insured\u2014Transfer of registration of insured\u2019s vehicle prior to accident little more than sham\u2014Policy in force at time of accident\u2014Judgment in personal injuries action assigned to Minister of Transport as result of payment from Unsatisfied Judgment Fund\u2014Validity of payment and assignment\u2014The Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act, 1961-62 (Ont.), c. 84, s. 21\u2014The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 190, s. 223(1).\nIn a class action brought pursuant to the provisions of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 190, to have the proceeds of a policy of motor vehicle liability insurance, issued by the defendant, applied in satisfaction of judgments and claims against the insured, judgment at trial was given in favour of the plaintiff. The Court of Appeal unanimously affirmed the trial judgment, and the defendant then appealed to this Court.\nThe plaintiff had recovered judgment for $1,500 against the insured and P in respect of damages suffered by her motor vehicle in a collision with one operated by the insured and at least partly owned by him. The plaintiff and her son recovered a further judgment against the insured for the sum of $10,500 for injuries received by the son in the accident and for expenses incidental thereto.\nNo question was raised as to the liability of the insured, but the records of the Ontario Department of Transport disclosed that the registration of the insured\u2019s vehicle was transferred to P on a date prior to the day of the accident. The defendant contended that the registration of the transfer was evidence of the fact that the insured sold the vehicle on the said date and that the policy thereupon lapsed and thus was not in force at the time of the accident. However, the record in the case revealed that the transfer did not disclose the true situation. and was little more than a sham. P was not really a beneficial owner of the vehicle but had the care of it to accommodate the insured who had lost his licence.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Court did not find it necessary to consider the question of whether or not the policy would have lapsed if there had been a genuine sale or transfer of ownership because the record showed that there was never any such sale or transfer. The policy in question was, therefore, in force at the time of the accident and the insurance moneys payable thereunder should be applied in or towards the satisfaction of the claims made by the plaintiff. The disposition ordered by the trial judge of the moneys payable in satisfaction of the judgment in the personal injuries action was occasioned because that judgment was assigned to the Minister of Transport for Ontario as the result of a payment having been made from the Unsatisfied Judgment Fund. The Court rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that the payment so made was illegal as being in contravention of s. 21 of The Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act, 1961-62 (Ont.), c. 84, and that the assignment which was made in consequence thereof was also illegal.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Morand J. Appeal dismissed.\nJ.P. Basset, Q.C., and R.A. O\u2019Donnell, for the defendant, appellant.\nW.S. Wigle, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought by the Glens Falls Insurance Company from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario rendered without recorded reasons which dismissed an appeal from a judgment rendered by Mr. Justice Morand wherein he declared that the respondent was entitled to have the insurance moneys, payable by the appellant under an \u201cowner\u2019s policy\u201d of automobile liability insurance in which Trifun Cvetkovics (hereinafter called the insured) was the named insured, applied in or towards satisfaction of two judgments recovered against him; one such judgment having been recovered at the suit of Ethel Epstein alone and the other by her and her son.\nThis is a class action brought pursuant to the provisions of s. 223(1) of The Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 190, by Ethel Epstein on behalf of herself and all other persons having judgments or claims against Trifun Cvetkovics arising out of an automobile collision in respect of which it is alleged that indemnity is provided under a motor vehicle liability policy issued by the appellant. Section 223(1) of The Insurance Act reads as follows:\n223. (1) Any person having a claim against an insured, for which indemnity is provided by a motor vehicle liability policy, is, notwithstanding that such person is not a party to the contract, entitled, upon recovering a judgment therefor against the insured, to have the insurance money payable under the policy applied in or towards satisfaction of his judgment and of any other judgments or claims against the insured covered by the indemnity and may, on behalf of himself and all persons having such judgments or claims, maintain an action against the insurer to have the insurance money so applied.\nThe effect of this section as it occurs in the Saskatchewan Insurance Act is succinctly stated by Judson J. in Canada Security Assurance Co. v. Joynt[1], at p. 113 where he says:\nThe question in the statutory action is not whether the judgment in the liability action is correct but whether the plaintiff has a judgment against the insured for which indemnity is provided in the motor liability policy. A plaintiff in such an action proves his case by putting in the judgment against the insured, the insurance policy and proof of nonpayment. All else is a matter of defence with the onus of proof on the insurance company.\nThe respondent in the present action has put in evidence a judgment which she recovered in the amount of $1,500 and costs against the insured and Borivoje Pesic in respect of damages suffered by her motor vehicle in a collision with one operated by the insured and at least partly owned by him, and she also put in evidence a further judgment against the insured in the sum of $10,500 recovered by herself and her son arising out of the same accident and relating to injuries suffered therein by her son and expenses incidental thereto.\nThe respondent also put in evidence the \u201cowner\u2019s policy\u201d of automobile liability insurance, hereinbefore referred to, by which the appellant agreed (inter alia) to indemnify the insured against liability imposed upon him by law to the limit of $100,000 for loss or damage arising from his ownership, use or operation within Canada of the automobile which was operated by the insured at the time of the accident in question. The policy purported to cover a period from February 28, 1959, until February 28, 1960, and the accident occurred on January 10, 1960.\n\u201cOwner\u2019s Policy\u201d is defined by s. 198 (g) of The Insurance Act as follows:\n\u201cowner\u2019s policy\u201d means a motor vehicle liability policy insuring a person named therein in respect of the ownership, operation or use of an automobile owned by him and specifically described in the policy and in respect of the ownership, operation or use of any other automobile that may be within the definition thereof appearing in the policy.\nThe italics are my own. No question is raised as to the liability of the insured, but the records of the Ontario Department of Transport disclose that the registration of the vehicle in question in his name \u201cwas transferred March 18, 1959 to Borivoje Pesic...\u201d and the appellant contends that the registration of this transfer is evidence of the fact that the insured sold the vehicle on March 18, 1959, and that the policy thereupon lapsed and thus was not in force at the time of the accident. The transfer on the records of the Department of Transport was proved by introduction of a copy of a statement required to be kept under The Highway Traffic Act and purporting to be certified by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles. In this regard s. 152(2) of The Highway Traffic Act reads as follows:\nA copy of any writing, paper or document filed in the Department pursuant to this Act, or any statement containing information from the records required to be kept under this Act, purporting to be certified by the Registrar under the seal of the Department, shall be received in evidence in all courts without proof of the seal or signature and is prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein.\nIt will be noted that the production of the certified copy of the transfer to Pesic provides only prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein and in my view the following circumstances appearing from the record in this case make it clear that the transfer so recorded did not disclose the true situation and was little more than a sham:\nIn the action brought by Mrs. Epstein against the insured and Pesic for damage to her motor vehicle, the defendants were both represented by a lawyer named N. Pasic who prepared a statement of defence in which it was admitted that at all material times both defendants were the owners of the motor vehicle and that the insured was the operator thereof. At the trial of that action Mr. Pasic appeared on behalf of the defendants and stated:\nI feel that the only problem I have in front of me is the position, regarding these two defendants, there will be a certain conflict of interests between them. In my defence I stated that both defendants were owners of this motor vehicle. Subsequently, I found that the defendant, Pesic, was not really a beneficial owner of this vehicle, but he had care of this motor vehicle to accommodate the other defendant who had lost his licence. There are other proceedings involved in this action in Hamilton. There are, unfortunately, injuries to the driver of the other vehicle. However, the only other thing I would like to straighten up is the error that the defendant, Cvetkovics is the owner\u2014the other defendant, Pesic, is not really an owner, he was merely an accommodating party. Mr. Pasic later said:\nThe only worry was Cvetkovics, he told me he was worried about his friend in Hamilton who was merely an accommodating party, and I told them that if they did not give me instructions I would withdraw, so I have to be struck off the record.\nWhen the action was later brought against the same two defendants in respect of the injuries sustained by David Epstein and the expenses incidental thereto, a defence was filed containing the following allegations:\n2. The defendant Borivoje Pesic denies that he was the owner of the motor vehicle mentioned in the Statement of Claim and the fact is that the said motor vehicle was transferred by the defendant Cvetkovics to Borivoje Pesic as a matter of convenience and that the defendant Cvetkovics retained at all material times ownership of the same.\n3. At the material time of the accident the defendant Cvetkovics was in sole control of the motor vehicle owned by him.\nAs I have indicated, it was strongly contended that the policy lapsed immediately upon the transfer of registration being filed in the records of the Department of Transport but, like the learned trial judge, I do not find it necessary to consider the question of whether or not the policy would have lapsed if there had been a genuine sale or transfer of ownership because the record of the cases before us satisfies me that there was never any such genuine sale or transfer and I am therefore of opinion that the policy here in question was in force at the time of the accident and the insurance moneys payable thereunder should be applied in or towards the satisfaction of the claims made by the respondent herein.\nIn the judgment of the learned trial judge, which was affirmed on appeal, it is declared that the respondent is entitled to have the insurance moneys payable under the policy in question applied in or towards the satisfaction of the judgments hereinbefore referred to in manner following:\n(a) The Judgment of Ethel Epstein dated the 22nd day of September, 1961, in the sum of $1,500.00 with interest at five (5%) percent per annum from the date thereof and the sum of $453.50 with interest at the said rate from the 6th date of November, 1961;\n(b) Her Majesty the Queen represented by the Minister of Transport for the Province of Ontario pursuant to the Judgment in favour of Ethel Epstein and David Epstein dated the 28th day of May, 1962, together with interest at five (5%) per annum from the 28th day of May, 1962, the said Judgment being in the sum of $10,500.00 inclusive of costs. The disposition of the moneys payable in satisfaction of the judgment obtained in the personal injuries action was occasioned because that judgment was assigned to the Minister of Transport for the Province of Ontario as the result of a payment having been made from the Unsatisfied Judgment Fund, and the appellant contends that the payment so made was illegal as being in contravention of s. 21 of The Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act, 1961-62 (Ont.), c. 84, and that the assignment which was made in consequence thereof was also illegal. Section 21 of The Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act reads as follows:\nNo payment shall be made out of the fund in respect of a claim or judgment for damages or in respect of a judgment against the Registrar of an amount paid or payable by an insurer by reason of the existence of a policy of insurance within the meaning of The Insurance Act, other than a policy of life insurance, and no amount sought to be paid out of the Fund shall be sought in lieu of making a claim or receiving a payment that is payable by reason of the existence of a policy of insurance within the meaning of The Insurance Act, other than a policy of life insurance, and no amount so sought shall be sought for payment to an insurer to reimburse or otherwise indemnify the insurer in respect of any amount paid or payable by the insurer by reason of the existence of a policy of insurance within the meaning of The Insurance Act, other than a policy of life insurance.\nIn July 1962, when the payment and assignment above referred to were made, the appellant denied, as it did before us, that there was any valid policy of insurance in existence and this issue was not determined by any Court until judgment was rendered herein by the learned trial judge on February 10, 1967. Under these circumstances it does not appear to me that the Minister of Transport was in breach of s. 21 in authorizing payment out of the Fund to Mrs. Epstein and her son. The fact that it was decided more than four years later that the policy in question was in existence and in force at the time of the accident cannot, in my view, be treated as invalidating the payment made out of the Fund or the assignment given to the Minister of Transport for Ontario.The position therefore, in my opinion, is that at the time when the present action was brought, the Minister of Transport held a valid assignment of a claim for personal injuries which was covered by the indemnity provided in the policy issued by the appellant to which reference has hereinbefore been made. The present action is a class action brought on behalf of all persons having judgments or claims covered by the policy and in my opinion Mrs. Epstein was suing on behalf of the Minister of Transport in so far as the judgment in the personal injuries action was concerned, and the judgment of the learned trial judge should be affirmed in the form in which it was rendered.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Bassell, Sullivan, Holland & Lawson, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Hughes, Amys, Wigle, Monaghan, Duke & Harlock, Toronto.\n[1] [1967] S.C.R. 110.\n",

Its sales are often made on a deferred payment basis and were, during the period relevant to this case, financed by one of the finance companies with which it had arrangements. Through the agency of its brokers and representatives, which incidentally were also brokers for the other party, the appellant negotiated with the respondent three blanket insurance policies very similar in substance, one related to each of the three finance companies. These policies contemplate insurance coverage from the date the sale is completed to the end of the financing period. The contract, inter alia, provides that \u201call such sales\u201d shall be reported \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d to the respondent or to its brokers. The appellant company sold a tractor to the appellant G. This sale was referred to and approved by the finance company (mis-en-cause) but before notice of such sale had been given to the respondent or its brokers, the tractor was damaged beyond repairs. It was then found that some of the clients of the appellant company had insured their financed equipment through their own finance company. Upon request by the appellants for the issuance of an insurance certificate, the respondent denied all liability under the contract and refused to issue such a certificate on the grounds that all financed sales had not been reported and that such a failure amounted to a breach of a condition which is of the essence of the contract. In the Superior Court the trial judge came to the conclusion that the disputed clause of the blanket policy could not be interpreted as being a reciprocal undertaking by the appellant company to report all financed sales. In his opinion, this interpretation found support in another clause of the blanket policy which provides that, if other valid and collectible insurance exists at the time of the loss, the respondent\u2019s policy shall apply only as excess after all other insurance has been exhausted. The Court of Appeal found that the reporting requirement was a promissory condition of the blanket policy and that the respondent was justified under the terms of art. 2490 of the Civil Code to ask that the policy be considered as null and void on account of the failure of the appellant company to report all financed sales.\nHeld (Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Fauteux, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The obligation to report all financed sales amounted to a promissory condition and was of the essence of the contract in that the acceptance of the risk and the rate of premiums were directly related to the volume of business. The reporting requirement was, thus, truly a condition of the contract within the meaning of art. 2490 of the Quebec Civil Code and the failure by the appellant company to comply with that condition justified the respondent to ask that the contract be declared null and void.\nPer Spence and Pigeon JJ., dissenting: The existence of two other similar contracts shows that the insurance policy sued upon did not intend to cover all financed sales made by the appellant company. The respondent\u2019s plea also is not that all three policies should be considered as one single document but that only one should be voided. As to the contract in question, it further contains no express stipulation that it should be void if the sales are not promptly reported. It follows that, as the literal reading does not show the true intention of the parties, recourse must be had to interpretation in compliance with the rule enunciated in art. 1013 of the Quebec Civil Code, The true question is, therefore, whether or not in the light of relevant circumstances, the contract did become void by reason of the appellant\u2019s failure to report, as soon as it was feasible, full details of all financed sales. Inasmuch as there was no provision regarding the avoidance of the contract if the reporting requirement was not complied with, such requirement was simply one among many stipulations of the contract most of which are certainly not resolutive conditions. Every stipulation in an insurance policy is not necessarily a warranty or condition within the meaning of art. 2490 of the Civil Code with the drastic consequences that this implies. Notwithstanding the provisions contained in art. 2490 and 2491 of the Civil Code, the general rule remains that the breach of an obligation does not bring about dissolution of a contract unless there is a resolutive condition, but only gives rise to the remedies enumerated in art. 1075 of the Civil Code. Otherwise, any breach whatsoever of any stipulation would ipso facto make the contract void. The insurer could then disclaim liability even if the breach is immaterial to the loss and thus make the protection illusory.\nAssurance\u2014Police d\u2019assurance en compte-courant\u2014Disposition obligeant l\u2019assur\u00e9 de d\u00e9clarer toutes ses ventes\u2014Interpr\u00e9tation\u2014La n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de d\u00e9clarer les ventes est-elle une condition du contrat\u2014Nullit\u00e9\u2014Art. 1013, 2490 et 2491 du Code Civil.\nLa compagnie appelante fait le commerce de mat\u00e9riel lourd. Ses ventes comportent souvent des versements \u00e9chelonn\u00e9s et, au cours de la p\u00e9riode comprise dans cet appel, le financement des ventes \u00e0 paiements diff\u00e9r\u00e9s se faisait par l\u2019entremise de l\u2019une des compagnies de finance avec lesquelles la compagnie appelante s\u2019\u00e9tait pr\u00e9alablement entendue. Par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de son courtier et repr\u00e9sentant, qui incidemment \u00e9tait aussi le courtier de l\u2019autre partie, la compagnie appelante avait n\u00e9goci\u00e9 et obtenu trois polices d\u2019assurance en compte-courant, fort semblables quant au contenu, chacune se rapportant \u00e0 l\u2019une des trois compagnies de finance. Ces polices d\u2019assurance pr\u00e9voient que la protection qu\u2019elles accordent s\u2019\u00e9tend \u00e0 compter du jour o\u00f9 la vente est compl\u00e9t\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de la p\u00e9riode de financement. La compagnie appelante a vendu un tracteur \u00e0 l\u2019appelant G. La compagnie de finance (mise-en-cause) fut inform\u00e9e de cette vente et l\u2019approuva. Mais avant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou son courtier n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 de cette vente le tracteur fut endommag\u00e9 irr\u00e9parablement. On apprit alors que certains clients de la compagnie appelante avaient fait financer leurs achats de mat\u00e9riel lourd par leur propre compagnie de finance. Lorsque les appelants ont demand\u00e9 qu\u2019un certificat d\u2019assurance leur soit remis, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a ni\u00e9 toute responsabilit\u00e9 aux termes du contrat parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de toutes les ventes \u00e0 paiements diff\u00e9r\u00e9s faites par la compagnie appelante. A son avis, ceci constituait un manquement \u00e0 une condition essentielle du contrat. En Cour sup\u00e9rieure le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a estim\u00e9 que la clause qui fait l\u2019objet du litige ne pouvait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme une contrepartie des obligations de l\u2019assureur imposant \u00e0 la compagnie appelante le devoir de d\u00e9clarer toutes ses ventes \u00e0 paiements diff\u00e9r\u00e9s. Selon lui, cette interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9tait appuy\u00e9e par une autre clause de la police aux termes de laquelle, au cas o\u00f9 il existerait d\u2019autres polices d\u2019assurance valides et recouvrables, la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019assureur ne s\u2019\u00e9tendrait qu\u2019\u00e0 la portion de la perte qui n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 couverte et apr\u00e8s que toutes les autres indemnit\u00e9s auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 per\u00e7ues. La Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que l\u2019obligation de d\u00e9clarer \u00e9tait une condition promissoire de la police et que l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait en cons\u00e9quence justifi\u00e9e aux termes de l\u2019art. 2490 du Code Civil d\u2019en demander l\u2019annulation en compte-courant en raison du d\u00e9faut de la compagnie appelante de rapporter toutes ses ventes \u00e0 paiements diff\u00e9r\u00e9s.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, les Juges Spence et Pigeon \u00e9tant dissidents.\nLes Juges Fauteux, Judson et Ritchie: L\u2019obligation de d\u00e9clarer les ventes \u00e0 paiement diff\u00e9r\u00e9 se ram\u00e8ne \u00e0 une condition promissoire essentielle en ce sens que l\u2019acceptation du risque et le taux des primes ont un rapport direct avec le volume des affaires. Le devoir de d\u00e9clarer les ventes est, en cons\u00e9quence, une v\u00e9ritable condition du contrat au sens donn\u00e9 \u00e0 ce mot dans l\u2019art. 2490 du Code Civil et le d\u00e9faut de la compagnie appelante de se conformer \u00e0 cette condition justifiait pleinement l\u2019intim\u00e9e de demander l\u2019annulation du contrat.\nLes Juges Spence et Pigeon, dissidents: L\u2019existence de deux autres contrats semblables d\u00e9montre que la police d\u2019assurance qui fait l\u2019objet du litige n\u2019entendait pas couvrir toutes les ventes \u00e0 paiements diff\u00e9r\u00e9s faites par la compagnie appelante. L\u2019intim\u00e9e, \u00e9galement, n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9tendu, en guise de d\u00e9fense, que les trois polices d\u2019assurance devaient \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es comme formant un tout, mais plut\u00f4t qu\u2019une seule police devait \u00eatre annul\u00e9e. Quant au contrat en question il ne contient aucune stipulation expresse pr\u00e9voyant son annulation au cas o\u00f9 les ventes ne seraient pas promptement d\u00e9clar\u00e9es. Il s\u2019ensuit que, si le sens litt\u00e9ral du texte ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le pas l\u2019intention des parties, on doit la rechercher par interpr\u00e9tation conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019art. 1013 du Code Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Le probl\u00e8me v\u00e9ritable est donc de savoir si, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de toutes les circonstances qui se rapportent \u00e0 cette cause, le contrat d\u2019assurance est devenu nul du fait seulement que la compagnie appelante a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de d\u00e9clarer toutes ses ventes \u00e0 paiement diff\u00e9r\u00e9. Etant donn\u00e9 que le contrat d\u2019assurance ne contient aucune disposition pr\u00e9voyant son annulation au cas o\u00f9 les ventes ne seraient pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9es, une telle exigence est simplement l\u2019une des nombreuses stipulations du contrat qui, pour la plupart, ne constituent certainement pas des conditions r\u00e9solutoires. Toute stipulation contenue dans une police d\u2019assurance n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement une garantie ou une condition au sens de l\u2019art. 2490 du Code Civil avec les cons\u00e9quences rigoureuses que cela implique. Nonobstant les dispositions contenues dans les art. 2490 et 2491 du Code Civil, la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est toujours que le manquement \u00e0 une obligation n\u2019entra\u00eene pas la dissolution du contrat \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait une condition r\u00e9solutoire. Ce manquement donne uniquement ouverture aux recours \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1075 du Code Civil Autrement, tout d\u00e9faut quelconque de se conformer \u00e0 l\u2019une des stipulations du contrat rendrait le contrat nul ipso facto. L\u2019assureur pourrait alors se d\u00e9gager de sa responsabilit\u00e9 m\u00eame dans le cas o\u00f9 le d\u00e9faut serait \u00e9tranger \u00e0 la perte et, de cette fa\u00e7on, rendre la protection illusoire. APPEL d\u2019un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine[1], province de Qu\u00e9bec, infirmant un jugement du Juge St-Germain. Appel rejet\u00e9, les Juges Spence et Pigeon \u00e9tant dissidents.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of St-Germain J. Appeal dismissed, Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting.\nRichard B. Holden, for the appellants.\nL.P. de Grandpr\u00e9, c.r., for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Judson and Ritchie JJ, was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal1, composed of Hyde, Brossard and Salvas, JJ.A., setting aside a judgment of the Superior Court which had maintained appellants\u2019 action and condemned respondent to pay $14,633.29 with interest and costs.\nThe facts leading to this litigation are recited at length in the reasons for judgment of Hyde, J.A.; for the determination of this appeal, only the following need be stated. Appellant, Automotive Products Co. Ltd., sells various payments, its sales, on such occurrence, were, during the types of heavy equipment. Frequently made on deferred period relevant to these proceedings, financed by one of three finance companies with which it had arrangements, namely the mise-en-cause Industrial Acceptance Corp. Ltd., Traders Finance Corporation Limited and Canadian Acceptance Corporation Limited. Through the agency of its brokers and representatives, Messrs. Rolland, Lyman, Burnett Ltd.,\u2014subsequently succeeded by Dale & Company Limited,\u2014appellant company negotiated with J.S. McDowell, agent for respondent insurer, three blanket or reporting insurance policies, one related to each of the three finance companies. These three blanket policies, similar in substance, envisage automatic cover, attaching at the time of the sale and lasting during the period of financing, on equipment sold on an instalment plan basis, and contemplate that, in each particular case, an individual certificate or policy would be issued, on request, in favour of the dealer Automotive Products Co. Ltd., the purchaser and the finance company concerned. The blanket policy designed to apply to sales financed by the mise-en-cause bears number 1BR 6775 of respondent\u2019s policies and is filed in the record as exhibit P-2.\nOn September 19, 1960, appellant company sold a tractor to appellant Gagnon. This sale, made on an instalment plan, was referred to the mise-en-cause to be financed. A few days later and before respondent or the broker for Automotive Products Co. Ltd. had been apprised of the sale, to wit on September 26, the tractor was irreparably damaged in an accident. Subsequent to this loss, appellants invoked the blanket policy filed as P-2 and requested respondent to issue an insurance certificate or individual policy, in their joint names, retroactive in effect to the date of the sale. Respondent refused to do so. It pointed out to appellants that the obligation assumed by the insurer in this respect no longer subsisted in view of the failure of Automotive Products Co. Ltd. to comply with the promissory condition, contained in P-2, according to which appellant company had undertaken to report and include in the cover all its financed sales. Appellants did not deny that many of these financed sales were insured with insurance companies other than respondent as indeed the evidence clearly shows. They contended, however, that nothing in the blanket policy prevented that to be done. Hence their action against respondent. In their declaration, they offer to respondent the amount of $360.00, alleged to be the premium payable under the terms of the blanket policy, and pray for judgment condemning respondent to pay them jointly and severally the amount of $21,229.64 with interest from the date of the loss or subsidiarily to pay these sums to them and the mise-en-cause as their respective interests may appear from the record or to the Court.

LOSS PAYABLE\nIt is hereby understood and agreed that loss, if any, is payable to THE INDUSTRIAL ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION, LIMITED and\/or the Insureds as their respective interests may appear. \u2026\nThe italics and the underlines are mine.\nIn the Superior Court, Mr. Justice St-Germain found that respondent\u2019s obligation to ensure all equipment sold on the instalment plan, was not subordinated to a reciprocal undertaking by appellant company to submit to respondent for insurance all such sales. The basis of his finding is that, on a consideration of the blanket policy, he could find no express or implied covenant subordinating respondent\u2019s obligation to the undertaking of appellant company. He referred to what was said, at page 249 et seq., in The Queen v. MacLean[2] as to conditions governing the right to imply a covenant in a contract. The learned judge found support for his interpretation in Clause X of the blanket policy, the presence of which, he said, was a clear indication that respondent had foreseen the possibility of appellant company ensuring with other insurance companies. For these reasons, he accepted appellants\u2019 interpretation of the contract, granted acte of their tender and deposit and condemned respondent to pay them jointly and severally the sum of $14,633.29 with interest from the date of the loss of the tractor, namely from September 26, 1960.\nIn the Court of Appeal, the premises upon which the Trial Judge predicated his interpretation were rejected as ill-founded. The Court accepted as valid respondent\u2019s explanation that Clause X was a standard clause in all inland marine contracts which would operate, in this case, to modify the rights of the insured against the insurer,\u2014but not his obligations towards the latter,\u2014should the equipment sold be covered by a master policy issued in the United States by the factory itself, in which event, the insured would be entitled, under P-2, to excess insurance only. Appellants\u2019 interpretation of Clause X was found by the Court to lead to a conflict between its provisions and those of the introductory paragraph of P-2,\u2014where the cause and consideration of the contract are set out,\u2014and it was found to denude of their literal, true and clear meaning the unambiguous words all sales, all such sales and other expressions italicized in the other paragraphs quoted above. It was also considered that appellants\u2019 interpretation was furthermore offending the rule that all the clauses of a contract are interpreted the one by the other, giving to each the meaning derived from the entire act (1018 C.C.). The Court concluded that the stipulations in the contract were onerous, synallagmatic, clear, precise and expressing without ambiguity the mutual intent of the parties in that they oblige respondent to ensure and appellant company to report and submit for insurance with respondent all its financed sales. The Court then noted that, some time in 1959, McDowell complained to Dale & Company that the respondent insurer was not getting the volume of business which had been anticipated when the blanket policy was written and that the following explanation was given by Dale & Company in a letter addressed, on October 15, 1959, to respondent insurer, for attention of McDowell:\nDear Sirs:\nFurther to our conversation of a fortnight ago, the captioned coverage has been discussed with both our Sub-Agent and Automotive Products Limited.\nIt has now been established that the bulk of Sales made by Automotive have been the type that does not require financing. They cite considerable government business and sales to very large companies.\nWe can assure you, however, that it is their feeling that this is a passing phase and that considerable sales of a financing nature will be made. The Assured is most interested in retaining the type of coverage offered by your Company and will make every endeavour to make it more attractive to you.\nThe Court also noted that McDowell, who had then accepted that explanation, did not learn of the breach of the promissory condition until this particular loss was being investigated and that when respondent complained of this breach, Dale & Company wrote respondent a letter on behalf of its client, Automotive Products Co. Ltd., which, in part, reads as follows:\nIn our discussions with the Automotive Products Co. concerning this loss, they have been most emphatic in stating that it has been the intention that the insurance on all financed equipment was to be reported under your Policy, and this has only been deviated from where the buyers have requested that they be allowed to insure under their own existing Policies, or where, in error, their Offices outside of Montreal have not been aware of the arrangements and have allowed the insurance to go to Merit.\nHaving found that there had been a breach of the promissory condition contained in the blanket policy, the Court of Appeal concluded that respondent was justified to invoke the provisions of art. 2490 C.C. and to ask that the policy be declared null and void. Hence the appeal to this Court.\nI am clearly of opinion that, under contract P-2, Automotive Products Co. Ltd. undertook to report to respondent insurer and include in the cover all sales financed by Industrial Acceptance Corp. Ltd. and that Automotive Products Co. Ltd. assumed a like obligation under the blanket policies respectively related to sales financed by Traders Finance Corporation Limited and by Canadian Acceptance Corporation Limited. I am also of opinion that the undertaking of appellant company, of which respondent\u2019s obligation to ensure is the counterpart, amounts to a promissory condition which, related to the volume of insurance business, accruing premiums and spreading of the risk, is, as shown in the evidence and found by the Court of Appeal, of the essence, in the consideration of the acceptance of the risk and the determination of the rate of premiums. In view of the breach of the promissory condition, art. 2490 C.C. receives its application in this case, there being nothing in the contract indicating an intent to derogate from the provisions of that article. In their note under 2490 C.C. the codifiers indicate that they have adopted la doctrine re\u00e7ue et fix\u00e9e depuis longtemps du droit anglais telle qu\u2019on la trouve dans les auteurs. In Aero Insurance Company v. Obalski Chibougamau Mining Company[3], Chief Justice Lafontaine of the Court of Appeal referred to this note of the codifiers and said, at page 156, la r\u00e8gle universellement suivie dans tout contrat d\u2019assurance et qui doit s\u2019appliquer par analogie \u00e0 l\u2019assurance des a\u00e9roplanes est \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans Halsbury, Laws of England, Vo. Marine Insurance, p. 417:\nThe essential characteristic of a warranty is that it must be exactly complied with, whether it be material to the risk or not. If it be not complied with, then, subject to any express provision in the policy, the insurer is discharged from liability as from the date of the breach, but without prejudice to any liability incurred by him before that date.\nAny inquiry into the materiality or immateriality to the risk is entirely precluded, and so are all questions, whether there has or has not been a substantial compliance with the warranty; and, where a warranty has been broken, although the loss may not have been in the remotest degree connected with the breach, the underwriter is none the less discharged of that account from all liability for the loss\u2026\nAt page 155, Chief Justice Lafontaine said:\nLa police devient nulle et l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne peut en cons\u00e9quence r\u00e9clamer les indemnit\u00e9s stipul\u00e9es, suivant la r\u00e8gle qu\u2019une partie contractante ne peut r\u00e9clamer l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des obligations de son cocontractant \u00e0 moins d\u2019avoir commenc\u00e9 par remplir les siennes. Dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le paiement de la prime n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la seule obligation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, il y avait de plus l\u2019obligation importante, essentielle, on pourrait dire, d\u2019obtenir les certificats n\u00e9cessaires et d\u2019enregistrement requis pour pouvoir op\u00e9rer un avion. Aussi longtemps que les certificats n\u2019\u00e9taient pas obtenus, l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne pouvait en aucune fa\u00e7on se servir de l\u2019avion assur\u00e9 sans manquer \u00e0 son contrat et \u00e0 la bonne foi envers l\u2019assureur. En sorte que le d\u00e9bat est clos et il faut dire que l\u2019action est irrecevable.\nThe decision of the Court of Appeal in that case was appealed to this Court and the appeal was dismissed with costs.[4]\nWith deference to those who have a contrary view and being of opinion that the Court of Appeal rightly dismissed the action taken by appellants against respondent, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Spence and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by\nPIGEON J. (dissenting):\u2014Appellant, Automotive Products Co. Ltd. (hereinafter called Automotive), is a dealer in tractors and other contractors\u2019 equipment. In 1955, Rolland, Lyman, Burnett Ltd., acting as its brokers, applied to respondent Insurance Company of North America for what might be called blanket insurance coverage for goods sold on finance.\nOn November 17, respondent issued a contract for such coverage. This contract provides for the issue of policies describing \u201call such sales\u201d to the vendor and purchaser jointly and stipulates that \u201cthe cover shall attach at the time of such sale\u201d. Full details of \u201call such sales\u201d are to be promptly reported to the respondent or to the above-named brokers. Clauses to be inserted in each policy to be issued are attached. In one of these notice of any loss is required to be given to the respondent or to \u201cits said agent\u201d and in another it is agreed that any loss \u201cis payable to the Canadian Acceptance Corporation, Limited and\/or the insureds as their respective interests may appear\u201d.\nOn December 7, 1955, another contract was issued by respondent with identical wording except that in the clause concerning the payment of losses, the Industrial Acceptance Corporation, Limited (hereinafter called I.A.C.) is named instead of the other finance company.\nFinally, on August 2, 1956, a third similar contract was issued in which the name of the finance company is Traders Finance Corporation Limited.\nFrom time to time, policies (also called \u201ccertificates\u201d) were issued under each of the three contracts or master policies. It also appears that although no change was made in the clauses providing for the reporting of the sales and of the losses, Dale & Company Limited were authorized to act as brokers for the purpose of Automotive\u2019s contracts with respondent.\nEarly in October 1959, its manager in Montreal complained to them of the small volume of premiums from Automotive business. By a letter dated October 15, he was advised \u201cthat the bulk of sales made by Automotive have been of the type that do not require financing\u201d. In fact, many sales that did require financing were not being reported to the respondent or Dale & Company because Automotive allowed purchasers on the instalment plan to obtain insurance from other sources if they preferred and did not report such sales. Also, the reporting and the payment of the premiums were not being done by Automotive itself but by the finance companies and the company financing each purchase reported the sale and paid the premium to the brokers only when no other insurance coverage was obtained.\nOn September 19, 1960, Automotive sold to appellant Maurice Gagnon through its Quebec branch a tractor with angledozer for a total price, including sales tax, of $18,000. The terms were $2,000. cash, the balance to be financed by I.A.C. over a term of thirty months. The purchaser does not appear to have requested insurance coverage by a company other than the respondent and the contract provided for an insurance premium to be added to the unpaid balance in addition to finance charges. The amount that was entered for this premium was $405. instead of $450. as required under respondent\u2019s policies in which clause XV requires premiums at the rate of $1. per $100. per annum. On September 22, the conditional sale contract was received by I.A.C. in Montreal. It immediately enquired from its Victoriaville branch the same day and, on the following day, received a telegram recommending favourable action. On September 26, which was a Monday, cheques were issued to Automotive in the amount of $16,000. for the balance of the purchase price, and in favour of Dale & Company in the amount of $405. for the insurance premium. This cheque was received by them and cashed the following day.\nUnfortunately, it also happened that on the 26th, the tractor was damaged beyond repair by accident, a fact that became known to Automotive the following day. Thus, Dale & Company had to report the sale and the accident to respondent at the same time. The respondent denied liability on two grounds:\n1\u00b0 that the tractor had not been intended to be covered by an insurance policy to be issued under its contract with Automotive;\n2\u00b0 that this contract was void because all sales made under finance had not been reported.\nThe trial judge came to the conclusion on the first point that the amount of $405. appearing in the conditional sale contract as insurance premium instead of $450. was not necessarily an indication that the risk was intended to be placed with Merit Insurance Company (I.A.C.\u2019s subsidiary). He added that the uncontradicted evidence was to the effect that the incorrect amount was the result of an error made by an employee in Automotive\u2019s Quebec office. This finding was upheld in the Court of Appeal and was not challenged before us.\nOn the second point, the trial judge considered that there was no express undertaking by Automotive to insure all merchandise sold under financed sales. He quoted an excerpt from the reasons of Gwynne J. in The Queen v. MacLean[5] and then clause X of the policy conditions re- specting other insurance, and held that it would not have been inserted if respondent had in mind that Automotive could not insure some financed sales elsewhere under pain of nullity of the contract.\nIn the Court of Appeal, it was considered on the contrary that the contract did require Automotive to report all financed sales and it was said that this obligation was not watered down by the clause respecting other insurance. Article 2490 C.C. was quoted and it was held that this justified Automotive in asking that the policy be declared null and void.\nAt this point, it appears necessary to quote at length the wording of the policy down to par.(F) as well as clauses IX, X and XIV of the policy conditions incorporated in it.\nIN CONSIDERATION OF THE PREMIUMS ACCRUING\nUNDER POLICIES TO BE ISSUED UNDER THIS CONTRACT\n\u2014THE\u2014\nINSURANCE COMPANY OF NORTH AMERICA\nDOES INSURE\nAUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTS CO.

Failure by the Insured to file either such claim or such proof shall invalidate the claim.\nCLAUSE X. OTHER INSURANCE\nThis Company shall not be liable for loss, if at the time of loss or damage, there is other valid and collectible insurance which would attach if this insurance had not been effected, except that this insurance shall apply only as excess and in no event as contributing insurance and then only after all other insurance has been exhausted. \u2026\nCLAUSE XIV. LOSS PAYABLE\nIt is hereby understood and agreed that loss, if any, is payable to THE INDUSTRIAL ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION, LIMITED and\/or the Insureds as their respective interests may appear. \u2026\nConcerning clause X, there is uncontradicted evidence that this is a usual clause in such contracts. It is apt to have effect even on the assumption that all financed sales are to be reported and covered by policies issued under the contract. There may be insurance taken by other parties and uncontradicted evidence shows how this may occur. Therefore the judges in appeal were right in holding that clause X did not show that the contract was not intended to cover all financed sales. This conclusion on the effect of that clause does not dispose of the case because there are other formidable difficulties in respondent\u2019s way.\nIn the first place it should be noted that respondent issued to Automotive not only the contract sued upon but a total of three such contracts. Mention of this fact is made in the reasons of Hyde J. but he does not appear to give it any consideration when dealing with the crucial point, namely whether the contract sued upon is intended to cover all financed sales. With respect, I feel that this is essential because the existence of two other contracts makes it impossible to conclude that this particular contract was intended to cover all such sales. As a matter of fact, respondent\u2019s manager, when heard as a witness, said:\nMy intention was that all financed sales would be insured through this policy or the other two.\nIt should be noted that respondent does not contend that the three documents or policies are evidence of one contract, not three. In its plea it asked that one only be declared void. This is not an oversight on its part. The record shows that on December 9, it sent a letter to the brokers suggesting that the other two policies be \u201cpicked up for cancellation and returned to us\u201d. On December 15, the brokers answered that the insureds have no desire at the present time to cancel any of the policies presently held by them. Respondent having taken no step to have the other two policies cancelled or declared void cannot now be heard to say that the three made up one contract. If they did, it would not be entitled to have it cancelled in part only. As a matter of fact, respondent\u2019s prayer by its plea is that the insurance policy filed as P-2 be declared void. This implies a judicial admission that it is a distinct contract.\nSuch being the case, it is impossible to hold that the contract sued upon must be read literally as covering all financed sales by Automotive. In fact, respondent\u2019s contention, as we have seen, is not that this is the intention of the contract. Also there is no express stipulation that the contract shall become void if all financed sales are not promptly reported. Under those circumstances, it is impossible in the present case to seek the intention of the parties in a literal reading; it must be sought by interpretation in accordance with article 1013 of the Quebec Civil Code. On that basis, the question becomes: Does the contract, read in the light of all relevant circumstances, provide, as respondent contends, that it will become ipso facto void if Automotive fails at any time to report as soon as practicable full details of any financed sale for the issue of a policy under that contract or another similar contract with respondent?\nA major difficulty in reaching that conclusion is the fact that no reference whatsoever is made to the other contracts. If the intention had been to subject the coverage to such a drastic condition, operating as of right, would this have been overlooked? If we assume that when the first contract was issued the intention was, as respondent\u2019s Montreal manager contends, are we also to assume that when a second and a third contract were issued the first was simply copied and the necessity of any reference simply overlooked? On what basis is it reasonably certain that Automotive would understand in the absence of any such reference that the meaning of the document was as respondent contends its intention was? It must also be borne in mind that the second contract was for the benefit of I.A.C., the mise-en-cause. On what basis could the latter be expected to read into the document all that which respondent contends should be read?\nAs we have seen, I.A.C. took charge of the reporting of the sales covered by insurance and of the payment of the premiums. Its course of action in reporting only the sales financed by it which were not otherwise covered by insurance undoubtedly indicates that this was not considered a breach of the conditions invalidating the contract. The same must be said of Automotive\u2019s decision to treat the contract as not compelling it to report financed sales otherwise insured. Of course, the construction thus put upon the contract by some parties is not decisive, especially because there is no evidence that it was brought to the knowledge of the respondent. On the contrary, the letter written by the brokers in 1959 was apt to put them under the erroneous impression that Automotive was reporting all financed sales. It must be noted that the brokers were in this instance agents of both parties, being expressly described as agents of the respondent in clause IX and treated as such in clause (E). The concluding sentence of their letter indicates that the worry appeared to be over a possible cancellation by notice: \u201cThe Assured is most interested in retaining the type of coverage offered by your Company and will make every endeavour to make it more attractive to you\u201d.\nIt must also be stressed that the contract between the parties does not expressly provide that it shall ipso facto become void if any financed sale is not reported as required. The reporting requirement is simply a stipulation of the contract. Of course, there are no sacrosanct words for expressing a resolutive condition that effects of right the dissolution of a contract when accomplished (1088 C.C.). However, such a condition is a departure from the usual effect of a stipulation in a contract. As a general rule, the breach of an obligation gives rise to the remedies enumerated in art. 1065 C.C., not to dissolution of the contract as of right. Therefore, it is safe to say that, as a rule, a stipulation is not to be construed as a resolutive condition unless the intention to do so is expressed. In the present case, the clause relied upon is merely one among many stipulations most of which are certainly not resolutive conditions. There is nothing in its wording indicating that it is of a different nature such as the word \u201cwarranted\u201d commonly used in insurance contracts to indicate that a resolutive condition is being stipulated.\nHyde J. appears to rely exclusively on art. 2490 C.C. quoted at length in his reasons and following which he says that in his opinion it was a condition of the blanket policy in question that Automotive would report all financed sales. On the assumption that the contract is to be read as so requiring, I fail to see how art. 2490 can be read together with 2491 as enacting that every stipulation in an insurance policy is a warranty or condition with the drastic consequences that this implies. In my view, those articles do not alter the general principles under which the breach of an obligation does not of itself effect the dissolution of the contract unless a resolutive condition is stipulated. If it was otherwise, it would mean that any breach whatsoever of any stipulation in an insurance policy would ipso facto make the contract void so that the insurer could disclaim liability even if the breach is completely immaterial to the loss. This would, of course, make the protection illusory in cases such as this. Human nature being what it is, it is simply impossible that no error or omission in reporting sales be made in a large business with many branches over many years. Upon a loss occurring, all the underwriter would have to do to avoid liability would be to make a careful check. Of course, such a contract could validly be made and, in that case, it would be the duty of the courts to give effect to it, but it would have to appear from the language used that such a contract was in fact made. Otherwise the general principles governing contracts should be applied as this Court applied them in the case of The Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Company v. Lefaivre[6] where the question was the effect of the non-payment of premiums due to bankruptcy.\nI must also point out that, assuming the contract should be construed as embodying a resolutive condition which was breached, I doubt seriously that respondent would be entitled to have it declared null as prayed for without any refund of premiums. The record shows that a number of policies were issued under that contract and substantial premiums paid. These policies were in favour of a number of purchasers. Some of them had no doubt expired but several were recent. In its plea, respondent alleged that it had no premium refund to make. It is obvious that respondent so denied being obliged to return any premium because it considered the policies issued as remaining in force and unaffected by the dissolution of the master contract effected ipso facto by the omission to report all sales. It cannot be so unless the insurance coverage under the policies issued to Automotive and the purchasers jointly is considered as subsisting independently of the main contract. That it is so is far from clear. The policies or certifi- cates as they were sometimes called, are clearly nothing but instruments evidencing a contract. Is there not a single contract, does not the word \u201ccontemporaneously\u201d in clause (D), par. 1 bear out that it is so? Of course, if there is a single contract, it cannot be declared null in part only. I do not find it necessary to express a conclusion on this point but it may be one more reason why clause (F) should not be read as a resolutive condition.\nThe amount allowed to appellants in capital and interest by the trial judge was not challenged before us and for the above reasons, I would allow the appeal with costs, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal and dismiss the appeal to that Court with costs and re-establish the judgment of the Superior Court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, SPENCE and PIGEON JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Par\u00e9, Ferland, Mackay, Barbeau, Holden & Steinberg, Montreal.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Tansey, de Grandpr\u00e9, Bergeron & Monet, Montreal.\nSolicitors for the mis-en-cause: O\u2019Brien, Howe, Hall, Nolan, Saunders, O\u2019Brien & Smyth, Montreal.\n[1] [1968] Que.

On appeal, the Court of Appeal affirmed the trial judgment and the defendant then appealed to this Court.\nHaving held that the concrete work generally was substandard, the trial judge concluded that although the work had not been done as called for in the contract that there had been substantial performance and that the plaintiff was entitled to be paid under the contract the amount provided for therein, giving credit for any deficiencies that he found to exist in the work. He thereupon proceeded to make what he called reasonable allowances for a number of so-called deficiencies which were, in fact, very serious defects in the whole of the concrete work and in other areas.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial varied.\nThe correct measure of the defendant\u2019s damages was the cost of making good the defects and omissions in the work the plaintiff contracted to do. Applying this principle, the Court found that the total of the amounts which the defendant was entitled to was $13,423. Deducting this amount from the plaintiff\u2019s net claim of $25,984.60 left a balance of $12,561.60 that the plaintiff was entitled to recover under its lien.\nHoenig v. Isaacs, [1952] 2 All E.R. 176; H. Dakin & Co., Ltd., [1916] 1 K.B. 566, applied.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming a judgment of Robinson D.C.J., sitting as Local Judge, in an action for enforcement of a mechanics\u2019 lien. Appeal allowed; judgment at trial varied.\nJoseph A. Mahon, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nG.W. Cameron, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.:\u2014This is an appeal in an action for enforcement of a mechanics\u2019 lien filed on the appellant Miller\u2019s farm property in the District of Temiskaming. The action was tried by His Honour J.B. Robinson, sitting as Local Judge of the Supreme Court, who declared that the respondent was entitled to a lien under The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 233, on the lands of the appellant for the sum of $22,654.60 and interest at 7 per cent from February 8, 1966, together with costs to be taxed on the Supreme Court scale. The appellant Miller appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and that Court, on January 19, 1968, affirmed, without written reasons, the judgment of His Honour Judge Robinson. The appellant now appeals to this Court.\nThe validity of the mechanics\u2019 lien was disputed at the trial, but the respondent\u2019s right to a lien was upheld by his Honour Judge Robinson. This issue was not argued before us, and I will deal with the matter on the basis that the lien was properly filed.\nThe parties entered into a contract in writing dated October 5, 1965, whereby the respondent agreed to erect for the appellant a dairy barn complex on the appellant\u2019s farm. The contract contained specific plans and specifications for the buildings and equipment to be installed therein. The contract called for four buildings as follows:\n(a) Cattle Feeding Building, 50\u2032 x 40\u2032 x 19\u2032 eave height called the feed barn;\n(b) Free Stall Barn, 75\u2032 x 50\u2032 x 9\u2032 eave height (the loafing area);\n(c) Milking Parlour, 40\u2032 x 15\u2032 x 9\u2032 eave height;\n(d) Milkhouse, 20\u2032 x 20\u2032 x 9\u2032 eave height.\nThe appellant who had limited experience as a dairy farmer relied on the respondent to build him a barn complex of good quality and in accordance with the regulations of The Milk Industry Act of Ontario, R.S.O. 1960, c. 239. The specifications provided that all the concrete work was to be 3,000 p.s.i. The respondent did not do the work itself but employed a subcontractor. On the completion of the work, the appellant took the position that the contract had not been fulfilled and that the work had not been done in accordance with the plans and specifications, and, in particular, the concrete work was very deficient and that the whole job had been done in a negligent manner. The learned trial judge, after a relatively long trial and having heard evidence on behalf of the appellant and the respondent, held as follows:\nA careful review of the evidence has impelled me to the conclusion that the concrete work generally was substandard in that the psi rating was below specifications, the porosity of the floors was too high as indicated by the absorption factor and the finish upon the floors in the milk parlour and milk house was inadequate.\nIt appears that these defects were contributed to by the use of pit run gravel to begin with, by the failure to increase the strength by compensating for this by using more cement (e.g. three to one instead of four to one), by inconsistent batching and lack of control over the concrete mix, by failure to remove large stones from the gravel and by pouring the cement in cold frosty weather with inadequate precautions to keep it from freezing.\nIndeed of four holes drilled for cores in the two outside slabs only one hole permitted the recovery of a core and that one was not suitable for a compression test.\nThe tests indicated that the concrete in the outside slabs were very weak ranging from below 1,000 psi for three holes, to below 1,590 psi for one hole.\nThe natural inference from the evidence as to the outside concrete slabs was that they had been poured upon frozen ground and that the frost had affected the curing of the cement.\nHaving so held, he concluded that although the work had not been done as called for in the contract that there had been substantial performance and that the respondent was entitled to be paid under the contract the amount provided for therein, giving credit for any deficiencies that he found to exist in the work. He thereupon proceeded to make what he called reasonable allowances for a number of so-called deficiencies which were, in fact, very serious defects in the whole of the concrete work and in other areas. In my view this is a case in which the learned trial judge might well have found that the contract had not been substantially performed, but he did not do so, and, as stated, found that he could apply the doctrine of substantial performance. That position was accepted by the appellant in this Court and the case remains to be determined on the basis that the finding of substantial performance is valid. However, having found that there were substantial deficiencies, the learned trial judge proceeded to allow deductions from the contract price therefor on a completely erroneous principle. Having found that the concrete work was wholly unsatisfactory, he went on to say that in lieu of having it replaced that it would be made serviceable by the application of some surface treatments by patching up and coating over and that that was all that the circumstances required.\nThe correct measure of damage in a case such as the present one was stated by Lord Denning in Hoenig v. Isaacs[1], where from the principles laid down in H. Dakin & Co., Ltd. v. Lee[2] he stated:\nThe measure is the amount which the work is worth less by reason of the defects and omissions, and is usually calculated by the cost of making them good.\nor as Pickford L.J. said in Dakin v. Lee, at p. 582:\n\u2026the case must go back\u2026 in order that it may be ascertained what is the expenditure necessary, first, to put this underpinning right and make it accord with the contract both in regard to quality and quantity, and, secondly, to do the work which ought to have been done\u2026Supreme Court of Canada\nFurther, Ridley J., quoting Parke J. said in the same case at p. 571:\n\u201cWhat the plaintiff is entitled to recover is the price agreed upon in the specification, subject to a deduction; and the measure of that deduction is the sum which it would take to alter the work, so as to make it correspond with the specification.\u201d\nIn my view the measure of the appellant\u2019s damage is the cost of making good the defects and omissions in the work which the respondent contracted to do.\nThe learned trial judge found that the area of concrete which was in the milk parlour, platform, free stall area, outside slabs, curbs and gutters was 5,300 square feet. The evidence of Helmer Pedersen, a masonry contractor of 18 years\u2019 experience, was that it would cost 50\u00a2 per square foot to remove the deficient concrete and $1 per square foot to put in new concrete. The appellant is accordingly entitled to an award of $7,950 under this heading in lieu of the $2,285 allowed him by the learned trial judge.\nIn addition to the deficient concrete work, the learned trial judge found that the walls of the milk house did not meet contract specifications in that they were not impervious to liquids up to three feet from the floor. The area to be altered in this respect was 133 square feet. He allowed $1.20 per square foot as a reasonable estimate to remedy the defect for a total of $160 and that amount should stand.\nThe learned trial judge also found that the contract had not been performed as to the exterior door, the screen door and the ceiling of the milk house and he allowed $75 for these items. However, Lorne M. Jelly, a local carpenter and contractor, whose evidence would appear to be credible, estimated it would cost $620 to alter the building and put in five windows and a proper door in accordance with the plans. I think that this is the amount which should be allowed which, with the $160 to make the walls of the milk house impervious to liquid, comes to $780.\nThe taking out of the concrete flooring in the milk parlour will necessitate the replacement of the floor heating coil at a cost of $358, according to the evidence of John A. Brown, the electrician who installed the electric cable originally. A claim for loss of heat and additional cost of electrical energy would be eliminated by placing the floor heating coil where it was intended to be placed by the specifications, and the appellant would, therefore, suffer no loss of heat or incur any additional expense for electrical energy. He is, however, entitled to the cost of replacing the floor heating coil at the figure of $358.\nReplacing the concrete also involves removing, storing and reinstalling the stalls and equipment in the milk room and milk parlour. The witness Albert Cooper, a dairy farm equipment dealer, testified that it would cost $2,645 to dismantle and store the equipment, to set up the stalls, to reinstall the milking equipment, and to take out and put back the auto-feed system as well as the electrical controls.\nThe learned trial judge made certain minor allowances as follows which should not be disturbed:\n(a)\nReinstalling the stalls in the free stall area..........................................................\n$ 65.00\n(b)\nDeficiency in insulation in the ceiling of the free stall barn.................................\n35.00\n(c)\nDefects in the construction of the feed barn and manger being short posts and other minor matters................................................................................................\n75.00\n(d)\nFor a defective beam and rafters in the feed barn..............................................\n15.00\nThe learned trial judge also found that the gutters in which the barn cleaner operated were of such poor quality that the barn cleaner was constantly breaking down and could not run properly. He allowed $160 under this heading. The witness, Jean Trudel, a farm machinery and equipment dealer who supplied the barn cleaner, testified that the chain which should have lasted 15 years was almost worn out at the end of two years and required replacing. The cost of the chain was $1,232 and with installation would come to $1,500. This amount should be allowed in lieu of the $160 fixed by the learned trial judge.\nIf is manifest that when all of the work has been redone, the appellant will not have the kind of modern dairy barn complex that he contracted for, but there was no evidence as to whether there was any actual loss in this regard or how it could be estimated, and I do not find it possible in the circumstances to make an award under this heading.\nThe total of the amounts which I find the appellant is entitled to is $13,423 and he is entitled to have this amount deducted from the respondent\u2019s net claim of $25,984.60 as found by the learned trial judge which leaves a balance of $12,561.60 that the respondent is entitled to recover under its lien. The judgment of the learned trial judge should be varied by substituting the sum of $12,561.60 for the sum of $22,654.60 where this figure appears in the formal judgment of the Court. The respondent will also be entitled to interest on the sum of $12,561.60 at the rate of 5 per cent per annum from the date of the judgment, namely, March 1, 1967.\nAs success at the trial was divided, I would direct that there be no costs to either party at the trial. The appellant is entitled to his costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court, the amount thereof to be set off against the amount which the respondent is entitled to recover.\nAppeal allowed; trial judgment varied.\nSolicitor for the defendant, appellant: Joseph A. Mahon, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Clement, Eastman, Dreger, Martin & Meunier, Kitchener.\n[1] [1952] 2 All E.R. 176 at 181.\n[2] [1916] 1 K.B. 566.\n",

The notice required by s. 662(1) of the Criminal Code was duly served and the appellant was brought before the magistrate on November 14. The notice specified 46 convictions in addition to the substantive offence. With the exception of one conviction for armed robbery and one for theft of money, all convictions related to unlawful possession and use of gasoline credit cards or automobiles. The magistrate found that at the time of the commission of the substantive offence the appellant was leading persistently a criminal life and that he was an habitual criminal. A sentence of preventive detention was then imposed. The Court of Appeal affirmed the finding and the sentence. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld (Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the sentence imposed in respect of the substantive offence restored.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Judson, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ.: On the evidence, the finding that the appellant was an habitual criminal was a proper finding. However, it has not been shown beyond a reasonable doubt that it was expedient for the protection of the public that the appellant should be sentenced to preventive detention. His criminal record is a formidable one but there is evidence that his last employer would be willing to re-employ him on his release. The appellant did not constitute so grave a menace that the protection of the public required that he be deprived of his liberty for the remainder of his life, subject only to the provisions of s. 666 of the Criminal Code and the Parole Act.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: The finding that the appellant was an habitual criminal was a proper one under the circumstances and the Court of Appeal did not err in affirming the magistrate\u2019s finding that it was expedient for the protection of the public in that province to sentence him to preventive detention. In forming its opinion as to whether or not it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence an habitual criminal to preventive detention, one of the main questions to be determined by the Court is whether he is a man whose record indicates that after he has derived the maximum benefit from imprisonment the public will be. best protected, and his own interest best served, by ensuring that his return to society is made subject to supervision and control of the Parole Board. In imposing a sentence of preventive detention the Court must be satisfied that there is a real danger to the public in the prospect of the accused being allowed at large in society without supervision after the expiration of his sentence for the substantive offence with which he is charged. Section 660 is to be applied in the cases of persons who have shown themselves to be so habitually addicted to serious crime as to constitute a threat to other persons or property in any community in which they live, and for so long as they remain at large without supervision. Habitual criminals with records such as the present appellant are proper subjects for the application of s. 660 of the Criminal Code.\nDroit criminel\u2014Repris de justice\u2014D\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive\u201446 condamnations ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re infraction\u2014La plupart des infractions se rapportent \u00e0 la possession et l\u2019utilisation ill\u00e9gales d\u2019automobiles ou de cartes de cr\u00e9dit de gazoline\u2014Opportunit\u00e9 pour la protection du public d\u2019imposer une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive\u2014Menace pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9\u2014Code Criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 662.\nAyant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable sur une inculpation de vol d\u2019une automobile en janvier 1967, l\u2019appelant, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 en mai 1967, a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 un terme de trois ans d\u2019emprisonnement le 10 juin 1967. L\u2019avis requis par l\u2019art. 662(1) du Code Criminel lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment signifi\u00e9 et l\u2019appelant a comparu \u00e0 nouveau devant le magistrat le 14 novembre. L\u2019avis contenait 46 condamnations en plus de l\u2019infraction dont il s\u2019agit. Sauf une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 pour vol \u00e0 main arm\u00e9e et une pour vol d\u2019argent, toutes les d\u00e9clarations de culpabilit\u00e9 se rapportent \u00e0 la possession et l\u2019utilisation ill\u00e9gales d\u2019automobiles ou de cartes de cr\u00e9dit de gazoline. Le magistrat a conclu qu\u2019au moment de la commission de l\u2019infraction dont il s\u2019agit l\u2019appelant menait avec persistance une vie criminelle et il l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 repris de justice. Une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive lui a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e. La Cour d\u2019appel a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration ainsi que la sentence. L\u2019appelant a obtenu la permission d\u2019appeler \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre accueilli et la sentence de trois ans impos\u00e9e le 10 juin doit \u00eatre r\u00e9tablie, les Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland et Ritchie \u00e9tant dissidents.\nLe Juge en Chef Cartwright et les Juges Judson, Hall, Spence et Pigeon: Sur la preuve, la conclusion que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait un repris de justice est la conclusion appropri\u00e9e. Cependant, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 hors d\u2019un doute raisonnable qu\u2019il \u00e9tait opportun pour la protection du public que l\u2019appelant soit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive. Son dossier est formidable mais la preuve contient une d\u00e9claration que son dernier employeur serait consentant \u00e0 l\u2019employer \u00e0 nouveau apr\u00e8s sa mise en libert\u00e9. L\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas une menace si grave que la protection du public exige qu\u2019il soit priv\u00e9 de sa libert\u00e9 pour le reste de sa vie, sujet seulement aux dispositions de l\u2019art. 666 du Code Criminel et de la Loi sur la lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle de d\u00e9tenus.\nLes Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland et Ritchie, dissidents: Dans les circonstances, il \u00e9tait appropri\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 repris de justice, et la Cour d\u2019appel n\u2019a pas fait erreur en confirmant la conclu- sion du magistrat qu\u2019il \u00e9tait opportun pour la protection du public dans cette province d\u2019imposer \u00e0 l\u2019appelant une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive. En se faisant une opinion sur la question de savoir s\u2019il est opportun pour la protection du public d\u2019imposer une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive \u00e0 une personne d\u00e9clar\u00e9e repris de justice, une des questions principales que la Cour doit d\u00e9terminer est de savoir s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un homme dont le dossier indique qu\u2019apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il a tir\u00e9 le plus grand avantage possible de l\u2019emprisonnement le public sera des mieux prot\u00e9g\u00e9, et ses propres int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 lui seront des mieux servis, si l\u2019on s\u2019assure que son retour dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est sujet \u00e0 la surveillance et au contr\u00f4le de la Commission nationale des lib\u00e9rations conditionnelles. La Cour doit \u00eatre satisfaite, lorsqu\u2019elle impose une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive, qu\u2019il y a un danger r\u00e9el pour le public dans la perspective qu\u2019il soit permis \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 de s\u2019en aller en libert\u00e9 dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sans surveillance apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de sa sentence pour l\u2019infraction dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9. L\u2019article 660 s\u2019applique aux cas de personnes qui se sont montr\u00e9es tellement adonn\u00e9es habituellement au crime qu\u2019elles constituent une menace pour les autres personnes ou la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans la communaut\u00e9 o\u00f9 elles vivent, et pour aussi longtemps qu\u2019elles demeurent en libert\u00e9 sans surveillance. L\u2019article 660 du Code Criminel s\u2019applique aux personnes d\u00e9clar\u00e9es repris de justice et poss\u00e9dant un dossier comme celui que poss\u00e8de l\u2019appelant.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique, confirmant une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive. Appel maintenu, les Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland et Ritchie \u00e9tant dissidents.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, affirming a sentence of preventive detention. Appeal allowed, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.\nKenneth G. Young, for the appellant.\nW.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Judson, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, pronounced on January 30, 1968, dismissing an appeal against a sentence of preventive detention imposed upon the appellant by His Worship Magistrate Isman, at Vancouver, on November 14, 1967, in lieu of a sentence of three years imprisonment imposed upon him by His Worship Magistrate Walker, at Vancouver, on June 10, 1967, following his conviction on June 3, 1967, on a charge that, at the City of Vancouver, between the 1st and 11th days of January, 1967, he did commit theft of a 1966 Ford Galaxie automobile of a value in excess of $50.\nAt the date of the hearing before Magistrate Isman, November 14, 1967, the appellant was forty-seven years of age.\nNo question was raised as to the fulfilment of the conditions precedent to the hearing of the application by Magistrate Isman prescribed by s. 662(1) of the Criminal Code. The notice required by that subsection was duly served on the appellant and a copy was filed with the Clerk of the Court.\nThe notice specified forty-six convictions in addition to the conviction on June 3, 1967, before Magistrate Walker of the offence set out in the opening paragraph of these reasons, which is hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe substantive offence\u201d, and concluded\nB. Other circumstances:\n1. That you are an habitual associate of criminals;\n2. That after brief periods of freedom you have consistently returned to your criminal way of life;\n3. That during your brief periods of freedom you have not had regular gainful employment.\nNo evidence was called by the Crown to show that since his release early in October 1966 the appellant was associating with criminals.\nThe learned magistrate found that it was proved beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time of the commission of the substantive offence the appellant was leading persistently a criminal life. This finding was concurred in by the Court of Appeal and I can find no ground for disagreeing with it. This leaves for consideration the question whether it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence the appellant to preventive detention.\nDavey C.J.B.C., who gave the judgment of the Court of Appeal, opened his reasons on this branch of the matter with the sentence:\nThe only doubt I have, or did have, is whether a sentence of preventive detention is expedient. The learned Chief Justice continued:\n\u2026 This man produced a letter from his employer, Ann Kostrich, which said that he was an honest man, which perhaps is true limited to her experience with him, but certainly was not true in view of his record and in view of his conduct while he was employed by her, because while employed by her he bought a car in Ontario for one hundred and twenty-five dollars and he switched the licence plates from the Ontario car to the B.C. car and vice versa, so that the presence of the B.C. car would not be noticed and identified. During that time, from the statement of Staff Sergeant Campbell, he continued to use the credit card, notwithstanding that he was gainfully employed at seventy-five dollars a week, I think it was.\nNow the learned Magistrate expressly refrained from taking those circumstances into consideration. In my judgment they were both relevant and material, and important. They are relevant to the question of whether this man was persistently leading a criminal life at the date of the substantive offence, because while they occurred after the commission of the substantive offence, they show full light on his activities at the time of the commission of the offence, and they explain what he did. They are also relevant and material to the question of the expediency of preventive detention, because they show that while gainfully employed he was still using the motor car which he had stolen; he switched the plates to conceal its identity; and he continued to use the stolen credit card. To my mind those circumstances destroy the inference which might have otherwise been open that by getting gainful employment he had determined to rehabilitate himself and that a sentence of preventive detention was no longer necessary. On those grounds I would dismiss the appeal.\nIt should be explained that while the substantive offence was committed between the 1st and 11th of January 1967, the appellant was not apprehended until the end of May 1967. The exact date of his arrest does not appear in the record.\nI agree with the view of Davey C.J.B.C. that evidence as to the appellant\u2019s way of life between the date of the commission of the substantive offence and his arrest some time thereafter was admissible and relevant to both the questions (i) Whether he was leading persistently a criminal life and (ii) whether it is expedient to sentence him to preventive detention. The contrary view expressed by the learned magistrate was, no doubt, founded on the following passage in Kirkland v. The Queen[1]:\nIn my opinion it is established by these decisions, and I would so hold on the wording of s. 575c(1) if the matter were devoid of authority, that before an accused can be found to be an habitual criminal the Crown, in addition to proving the prescribed number of previous convictions, must satisfy the onus of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time when he committed the indictable offence referred to in s. 575B the accused was leading persistently a criminal life.\nWhile the question which I am now considering did not arise in the Kirkland case, as there the accused was arrested immediately after committing the substantive offence, the statement that the date as of Which it is to be determined whether an accused is leading persistently a criminal life is the date of the substantive offence has been repeated in subsequent judgments of this Court.\nIn Paton v. The Queen[2], Judson J. who delivered the judgment of the majority of the Court said at p. 355:\n\u2026 One thing that Kirkland v. The Queen does decide is that it must be shown on the application to have the accused declared an habitual criminal that he is leading \u2018persistently\u2019 a criminal life, and that on this branch of the case the date to be taken is the date of the commission of the primary or substantive offence.\nIn Hadden v. The Queen[3], with the concurrence of Judson, Hall and Spence JJ., I said:\nIt has been held in a unanimous judgment of this Court in Kirkland v. The Queen that the time at which the Crown must show that an accused is leading persistently a criminal life is the time of the commission of the substantive offence.\nBut Pigeon J., while agreeing in the result, did not agree with this passage.\nThe question which I am now considering did not arise for decision in either Paton v. The Queen or Hadden v. The Queen. In each of these cases the accused was arrested on the same day as that on which he committed the substantive offence.\nI find myself in complete agreement with the following passage in the reasons of Pigeon J. in Paton v. The Queen, supra, at pp. 362 and 363:\nConcerning the unanimous decision of this Court in Kirkland v. The Queen, this appears to be a case for the application of the rule enunciated by Lord Halsbury in Quinn v. Leathern and often referred to in this Court v.g. Regina v. Snider; The Queen v. Harder; Robert v. Marquis, \u2018that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides\u2019. In the Kirkland case the determination of the period of time to be considered in making a finding that an accused is an habitual criminal was not in issue. The only question considered was what evidence is necessary to prove that an accused is \u2018leading persistently a criminal life\u2019. In the reasons for judgment it was said (at p. 7) that \u2018the Crown had failed to satisfy the onus of proving that at the time of the commission of the substantive offence, the appellant was leading persistently a criminal life\u2019. In that case the accused had been apprehended immediately after the commission of the primary offence and undoubtedly was afterwards in custody until the sentence was passed. Therefore, it was obvious that the fact of leading persistently a criminal life was to be proved to have existed at the time of the commission of the primary offence and not subsequently as must indeed be the case in practically every instance, seeing that accused with criminal records such as to render them apt to be declared habitual criminals are not usually let out on bail. Thus, it appears to me that what was said in Kirkland v. The Queen should be taken merely as a statement of what had to be proved in that case, not as an exposition of the meaning of the statute applicable to different circumstances.\nIn the case at bar if it were shown beyond a reasonable doubt that up to the time when he was arrested in May 1967 the appellant was leading persistently a criminal life and the other conditions prescribed in s. 660(2) were fulfilled, this would warrant a finding that the appellant was an habitual criminal. I have already stated my conclusion that this was a proper finding on the evidence in this case.\nI am, however, of opinion that it has not been shown beyond a reasonable doubt that it is expedient for the protection of the public that the appellant should be sentenced to preventive detention.\nOf the 47 convictions set out in the Notice of Application, 27 (Nos. 7, 20, 21 and 23 to 46 inclusive), relate to the unlawful possession and use, by the appellant, of gasoline credit cards. Twenty-four of them, Nos. 23 to 46 inclusive, all of which were made on July 21, 1965, and involved sums totalling $245.95 resulted, in the words of counsel for the appellant, from \u201ca single spree\u201d extending over the month of December 1964 and early January 1965. Of the remaining offences enumerated in the Notice of Application 8, Nos. 1, 3, 5, 10, 13, 18, 19 and the \u201csubstantive offence\u201d itself, relate to the theft and\/or unlawful possession and use, by the appellant, of automobiles.\nSince 1957, with the exception of one conviction for theft of money in March 1965, the appellant has been involved in no criminal activity which has not, in some way, related to automobiles or gasoline credit cards.\nOnly one of the 47 convictions was for a crime of violence, armed robbery. This conviction was in October 1957 and the appellant was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment. He appears to have served 5 years of this sentence and I think it not unreasonable to assume that that sentence has had the effect of deterring him from the commission of further violent crime.\nThe appellant has now served almost two years of the sentence of three years imposed for the substantive offence. He must realize that if he is set at liberty at the expiration of that sentence and thereafter commits either of the offences of stealing an automobile or obtaining gasoline by fraudulent means he will be liable to a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment. His criminal record is indeed a formidable one but there is evidence that his last employer is willing to re-employ him on his release. On the whole, I am of opinion that, although it is impossible to say that the appellant is merely a nuisance, he does not constitute so grave a menace that the protection of the public requires that he be deprived of his liberty for the remainder of his life, subject only to the provisions of s. 666 of the Criminal Code and the Parole Act.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the sentence of preventive detention and restore the sentence of three years imprisonment imposed in respect of the substantive offence.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J. (dissenting):\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice and after careful consideration, I have decided that it is desirable for me to record my reasons for dissenting from his view.\nThe Chief Justice has concluded that the finding that the appellant was an habitual criminal was a proper one under the circumstances and with this I respectfully agree; but I cannot assign any ground for holding that the Court of Appeal of British Columbia erred in affirming the opinion of the learned magistrate that it was expedient for the protection of the public in that Province to sentence the appellant to preventive detention.\nI think it to be convenient at the outset to reproduce in full the habitual criminal provisions contained in s. 660 of the Criminal Code which read as follows:\n660. (1) Where an accused has been convicted of an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence of preventive deten- tion in lieu of any other sentence that might be imposed for the offence of which he was convicted or that was imposed for such offence, or in addition to any sentence that was imposed for such offence if the sentence has expired, if\n(a) the accused is found to be an habitual criminal, and\n(b) the court is of the opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.\n(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), an accused is an habitual criminal if\n(a) he has previously, since attaining the age of eighteen years, on at least three separate and independent occasions been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or more and is leading persistently a criminal life, or\n(b) he has been previously sentenced to preventive detention.\n(3) At the hearing of an application under subsection (1), the accused is entitled to be present.\nIn the case of Poole v. The Queen[4], which was heard by the full Court in December of last year, it was decided by the majority that this Court has jurisdiction under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act to entertain an application for leave to appeal from a finding that, in relation to the appellant \u201cit is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention\u201d. In the reasons for judgment of the majority it was stipulated that:\nWhether or not in any particular case it is expedient to so sentence a person found to be an habitual criminal is a question of fact or perhaps a question of mixed law and fact; it is certainly not a question of law alone.\nIt was also recognized by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in Regina v. Charming[5] that the determination of what is expedient for the protection of the public is a question of fact in each case, but as the determination of this issue is, under the provisions of s. 660(1)(b) of the Criminal Code made dependent upon the opinion of the courts concerned, it is desirable, as the Chief Justice appears to me to have recognized, that some principle should be established according to which such opinion is to be formulated. It appears to me that the guiding principle to be gathered from the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice in the present case is expressed in the following terms:\n\u2026I am of opinion that, although it is impossible to say that the appellant is merely a nuisance, he does not constitute so grave a menace that the protection of the public requires that he be deprived of his liberty for the remainder of his life, subject only to the provisions of s. 666 of the Criminal Code and the Parole Act.\nThe requirement that a man must be found to be a menace before a sentence of preventive detention can be properly imposed upon him finds its origin in the decision of Lord Goddard in Rex v. Churchill[6], where he said, at page 110:\nThe object of preventive detention is to protect the public from men or women who have shown by their previous history that they are a menace to society while they are at large.\nIn order to determine the sense in which Lord Goddard used the word menace, it is necessary to consider the statement he made in the same case at page 112 where he said:\nAs we have already said, when such sentences have to be passed the time for punishment has gone by, because it has had no effect. It has become a matter of putting a man where he can no longer prey upon society even though his depredations may be of a comparatively small character, as in the case of habitual sneak thieves.\nThe italics are my own.\nThe test of whether or not a man constitutes a \u201cmenace to society\u201d was first applied in this Court in relation to s. 660(1)(b) in Poole v. The Queen, supra, where it was said of the appellant on behalf of the majority of the Court:\n\u2026I am not satisfied that his release at the expiration of the terms of imprisonment to which he has been sentenced for the substantive offences will, to use the words of Lord Goddard, constitute a menace to society or that the protection of the public renders it expedient that he should spend the rest of his life in custody.\nIf the word \u201cmenace\u201d as used in this excerpt from the reasons for judgment in that case and in the present case were to be given the meaning attributed to it by Lord Goddard, it would appear to include anyone who could be said to \u201cprey upon society\u201d; but in the present case the Chief Justice appears to have added a further ingredient as a prerequisite to the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention by indicating that before such a sentence is imposed, the accused man must \u201cconstitute so grave a menace that the protection of the public requires that he be deprived of his liberty for the remainder of his life, subject only to the provisions of s. 666 of the Criminal Code and the Parole Act\u201d. (The italics are my own).\nIn this regard I think it desirable to examine the provisions of s. 666 of the Criminal Code and the Parole Act in order to determine whether the question of \u201cbeing deprived of his liberty for the remainder of his life\u201d is one which necessarily arises at all as a result of the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention. I think on the contrary that under the provisions of s. 666 of the Criminal Code and the terms of the Parole Act, 1958 (Can.), c. 38, Parliament has expressly provided for the supervised return to society of habitual criminals who have been sentenced to preventive detention. Section 666 of the Criminal Code reads as follows:\nWhere a person is in custody under a sentence of preventive detention, the Minister of Justice shall, at least once in every year, review the condition, history and circumstances of that person for the purpose of determining whether he should be permitted to be at large on licence, and if so, on what conditions.\nThe italics are my own.\nBy s. 24(5) of the Parole Act, it is indicated that the powers, functions and duties of the Minister of Justice under s. 666 of the Criminal Code are transferred to the National Parole Board established by that Act. Turning to the provisions of the Parole Act itself, the following sections appear to me to be relevant:\n8. The Board may\n(a) grant parole to an inmate if the Board considers that the inmate has derived the maximum benefit from imprisonment and that the reform and rehabilitation of the inmate will be aided by the grant of parole;\n(b) Grant parole subject to any terms or conditions it considers desirable;\u2026\nSection 11 provides:\n11. (1) The sentence of a paroled inmate shall, while the parole remains unrevoked and unforfeited, be deemed to continue in force until the expiration thereof according to law.\n(2) Until a parole is revoked, forfeited or suspended the inmate is not liable to be imprisoned by reason of his sentence, and he shall be allowed to go and remain at large according to the terms and conditions of the parole and subject to the provisions of this Act.\nThe italics are my own. In the case of Poole v. The Queen, supra, at p. 392, these provisions are referred to in the reasons for judgment of the majority of the Court in the following terms:\nIn Canada if sentence is passed at all it must decree imprisonment for the remainder of the person\u2019s life subject to the possibility of his being allowed out on licence if so determined by the parole authorities, a licence which may be revoked without the intervention of any judicial tribunal.\nIt is true that a parole granted by the Parole Board may be revoked \u201cwithout the intervention of any judicial tribunal\u201d. What Parliament has seen fit to do is to establish a Board composed of people who are experienced in dealing with criminals and to assign to that Board the duty of reviewing at least once in each year \u201cthe condition, history and circumstances\u201d of every person upon whom a sentence of preventive detention has been passed, together with the power to allow such persons \u201cto go and remain at large\u201d under its supervision and subject to its right to recall such persons to imprisonment.\nIt is true that a man who is on parole has less than complete freedom, but in my view the Parole Act is directed to his \u201creform and rehabilitation\u201d rather than to depriving him \u201cof his liberty for the remainder of his life\u201d. It seems to me that in forming its opinion as to whether or not it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence an habitual criminal to preventive detention, one of the main questions to be determined by the Court is whether he is a man whose record indicates that after \u201che has derived the maximum benefit from imprisonment\u201d the public will be best protected, and his own interests best served, by ensuring that his return to society is made subject to the supervision and control of the Parole Board.\nIt is my view that in imposing a sentence of preventive detention the Court must be satisfied that there is a real danger to the public in the prospect of the accused being allowed at large in society without supervision after the expiration of his sentence for the substantive offence with which he is charged.\nI do not find any decision so far rendered by this Court which makes it plain that a sentence of preventive detention is only to be imposed on persons who have been guilty of repeated crimes of violence, and I can find nothing in s. 660 itself to indicate that it is directed solely to the pro- tection of the public against violence; it rather appears to me that the section is to be applied in the cases of persons who have shown themselves to be so habitually addicted to serious crime as to constitute a threat to other persons or property in any community in which they live, and for so long as they remain at large without supervision. The persons to whom Parliament intended the preventive detention provisions to apply are specified in s. 660(2) where \u201chabitual criminal\u201d is defined as one who has\n\u2026 since attaining the age of eighteen years, on at least three separate and independent occasions been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or more and is leading persistently a criminal life\u2026\nIt will be observed that it is not necessary for a man to have committed any crime of violence in order to be an habitual criminal and thus to be subject to a sentence of preventive detention. In my view the section has particular, though not exclusive, application to the hardened criminal who has spent the greater part of his life in prison and who, on his release, unless supervised, will commit a further offence. These are the people for whom, as Lord Goddard observed: \u201c\u2026 the time for punishment has gone by, because it has had no effect\u201d.\nAs I have indicated, the question of what is expedient for the protection of the public is a question of fact in each case, but it is essential that some principles be established against which to assess the facts. While I do not consider that we are bound in this case by the decision in Poole v. The Queen, supra, the two cases are undoubtedly similar and it has been suggested that as this Court has decided that it was not expedient for the protection of the public to sentence a man with such a formidable criminal record as Poole to preventive detention, it would be inconsistent to impose such a sentence on the present appellant.\nIt therefore appears to me to be desirable to examine the facts in these two cases.\nIn the case of Poole, the following factors appear to have influenced the majority of the Court:\nSince his convictions in 1959, the appellant has been guilty of no violent crime. For the crime of theft of an automobile in 1962 and the four substantive offences in 1965, which involved comparatively trifling sums, he has been sentenced to severe punishment; there is some evidence of his trying to live a normal life; he is now 35 years of age. In the case of the present appellant, he is 47 years of age and has a record of 47 convictions which, according to my calculations, has resulted in his spending far the greater part of his adult life in prison, and I can find no evidence that he was at any time \u201ctrying to live a normal life\u201d. Very soon after his release from prison in 1967, he stole an automobile in British Columbia and drove it to Ontario, using stolen credit cards with which to fuel it. Of this incident he says:\nA. I couldn\u2019t find no work.\nQ. So you decided to steal a car?\nA. So I was reading the paper and there was work in Ontario, so I figured\u2014I didn\u2019t know how to get to tell you the truth the proper way, I haven\u2019t got too much money, to get there.\nQ. So you decided to steal a car?\nA. So I decided to get a car and get over there.\nQ. Steal a car?\nA. Steal a car.\nIt was not surprising that the appellant should follow this course as he had previously been convicted on six separate occasions for unlawful possession of motor vehicles and his convictions for use of other people\u2019s credit cards were numerous.\nWhen the appellant got to Hamilton he obtained employment as a bartender in a hotel which was apparently owned by a woman by the name of Ann Kostrich with whom he became \u201cquite friendly\u201d. He kept this job from February 1967 until he was arrested on the 30th of May in that year, and all the time he was so employed he was driving a stolen motor vehicle and fueling it with gasoline obtained with a stolen credit card. After his arrest his lawyer wrote to Ann Kostrich and received a reply which was admitted in evidence by consent and which read, in part, as follows: (referring to the appellant as Michael)\nMichael was a very good worker, honest and non-drinker, in fact I went away on two different occasions and left him in charge looking after the business. Whenever he is released, he always has a job with me, this I guarantee. If there is anything that I can do to help him, I will.\nThe Chief Justice was apparently referring to this letter when he said, after reviewing the appellant\u2019s criminal record:\nHis criminal record is indeed a formidable one but there is evidence that his last employer is willing to reemploy him on his release. On the whole I am of opinion that\u2026 he does not constitute so grave a menace that the protection of the public requires that he be deprived of his liberty for the remainder of his life. The Chief Justice also points out that the appellant \u201cmust realize that after he is set at liberty at the expiration of his present sentence and thereafter commits either of the offences of stealing an automobile or obtaining gasoline by fraudulent means, he will be liable to a maximum sentence of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment\u201d. It is perhaps worth observing that if the accused should receive such a ten-year sentence there will be no obligation upon the Minister of Justice \u201cat least once in every year\u201d to review his \u201ccondition, history and circumstances\u201d.\nThe disturbing feature of this case and one which in my opinion differentiates it from the Poole case, is indicated in the following paragraph of the Chief Justice\u2019s reasons for judgment:\nSince 1957, with the exception of one conviction for theft of money in March 1965, the appellant has been involved in no criminal activity which has not in some way related to automobiles or gasoline credit cards.\nWhen one considers that the appellant has been convicted 28 times since 1957, the record certainly appears to disclose a pattern of behaviour which is well illustrated by the appellant\u2019s own evidence in cross-examination when he said:\nQ. First question, Mr. Mendick, at any time during your career from 1937 on, did you ever decide to quit the life of crime and stop committing offences?\nA. Well, I\u2019ve tried many times; I never made, I never made\u2014I wasn\u2019t thinking of making any, of making a living out of crime. It seems like I was enjoying taking these cars and pass a few cheques. I didn\u2019t make no money at all. As a crime, I don\u2019t know what\u2014can\u2019t explain why I do all this, because I\u2019m working all the\u2014nearly all the time.\nIn my view, habitual criminals with records such as the present appellant are proper subjects for the application of s. 660 of the Criminal Code and I can find no ground for holding that the courts below were wrong in forming the opinion which they did.\nI would dismiss this appeal.\nAppeal allowed, FAUTEUX, ABBOTT, MARTLAND and RITCHIE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wilder, Young & Chambers, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Douglas, Symes & Brissenden, Vancouver.\n[1] [1957] S.C.R. 3 at 8, 117 C.C.C. 1, 25 C.R. 101.\n[2] [1968] S.C.R. 341, 3 C.R.N.S. 242, 63 W.W.R. 713, [1968] 3 C.C.C. 287, 68 D.L.R.

Rio Algom Mines Ltd., [1969] S.C.R. 880\nDate: 1969-06-06\nThe Minister of Mines for The Province of Ontario (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nRio Algom Mines Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1969: April 24; 1969: June 6.\nPresent: Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nTaxation\u2014Computation of tax\u2014Appraisal of value of ore at the pit\u2019s mouth\u2014Deductions\u2014Processing allowance computed on all milling capital\u2014Whether interest on borrowed capital deductible\u2014The Mining Tax Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 237 [am. 1955, c. 46, s. 2(1)].\nThe respondent company owned and operated two uranium mines in Ontario. The ore from these mines was not sold as such, but was processed by the company. As there was no \u201cactual market value of the output at the pit\u2019s mouth\u201d and \u201cno means of ascertaining the market value\u201d, the mine assessor was required by s. 4(3) of The Mining Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 237, to appraise the value of the output at the pit\u2019s mouth. The assessor, in working out his assessment, began with the value of the concentrate produced from the ore mined during the year in question and from this figure he deducted four items, referred to as \u201cprocessing and marketing deductions\u201d. On appeal from the assessment, the Ontario Municipal Board increased the deduction for \u201cprocessing allowance\u201d, and, in the end result, reduced the amount of tax. The company appealed to the Court of Appeal and the Minister cross\u2011appealed. The effect of changes made by the Court of Appeal was to further reduce the tax payable. The Minister then appealed to this Court and sought to have the original assessment, made by the assessor, restored. By way of cross-appeal, the company sought to vary the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which had allowed, as an item of processing expense, two-thirds of the interest paid by the company in the year of assessment on borrowed processing capital, by increasing such item to the full amount of such interest paid.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed in part and the cross-appeal dismissed.\nExcept with respect to the item of deduction for interest charges, the Court was in agreement with the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The company was not entitled to this deduction.\nIn view of the allowance, which was already granted on all milling capital, including capital which was borrowed as well as equity capital, it was not proper also to allow an outright deduction of interest on borrowed capital. To permit this, in computing the value of the output at the pit\u2019s mouth, for computation of tax, was to say that such value was lesser or greater depending upon the extent to which the milling capital was derived from borrowing or through equity capital. Furthermore, it would permit a taxpayer not only to deduct the interest charges, but also to obtain the benefit of the allowance on the borrowed capital upon which such interest was paid. APPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, allowing in part an appeal and dismissing a cross-appeal from a decision of the Ontario Municipal Board on an appeal from an assessment made under The Mining Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 237. Appeal allowed in part and cross-appeal dismissed.\nJ.D. Arnup, Q.C., and S. Sadinsky, for the appellant.\nJohn J. Robinette, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal by the Minister of Mines for the Province of Ontario from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, together with a cross-appeal by Rio Algom Mines Limited, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Company\u201d, from that judgment. The issues involve an assessment for taxes for the year 1957 under The Mining Tax Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 237.\nThe Company in the year 1957 owned and operated two uranium mines at Elliot Lake, Ontario, together with a concentrating plant near each mine. The ore came out of the mine in chunks of 6\u2033 to 8\u2033 in diameter, and proceeded to the mill and concentrating unit, in which it was first crushed to pieces about \u00be\u2033 in diameter, and then was subjected to a chemical process which resulted in the chemical extraction of uranium concentrate.\nThe Mining Tax Act imposed a tax on mines whose \u201cprofits\u201d exceed $10,000 per annum. Section 4(3) of the Act provided as follows:\n(3) The annual profits shall be ascertained and fixed in the following manner, that is to say: the gross receipts from the output during the calendar year of the mine, or in case the ore, mineral or mineral-bearing substance or any part thereof is not sold, but is treated by or for the owner, holder, lessee, tenant, occupier or operator of the mine upon the premises or elsewhere, then the actual market value of the output at the pit\u2019s mouth, or if there is no means of ascertaining the market value, or if there is no established market price or value, the value of the same as appraised by the mine assessor shall be ascertained, and from the amount so ascertained, the following, and no other, expenses, payments, allowances or deductions shall be deducted and made, that is to say:\nThen followed a series of deductions to be made from the ascertained value of the output at the pit\u2019s mouth. These permitted deductions are not relevant to the issues in this case, which are concerned with the proper method of ascertaining that initial value. Since the ore was not sold as such, but was processed by the Company, the assessor first had to consider whether, within the meaning of s. 4, there was a \u201cmarket value of the output at the pit\u2019s mouth\u201d; he concluded that there was not. The Ontario Municipal Board found as a fact that there was no \u201cactual market value of the output at the pit\u2019s mouth\u201d and \u201cno means of ascertaining the market value\u201d and in the Court of Appeal it was common ground that this was correct and that accordingly the task of the assessor was to appraise the value of the ore at the pit\u2019s mouth. The assessor, in working out his assessment, began with the value of the concentrate produced from the ore mined in 1957; there is no dispute that this value is $45,432,565.10. He then proceeded to take into account the cost of milling the ore and producing the concentrate therefrom, allowing a reasonable profit to the milling operation. From the sale price of the concentrate he deducted four items which he called \u201cprocessing and marketing deductions\u201d as follows:\nProcessing and marketing expenses...........................................................\n$10,562,491.41\nProportion of office, administrative and mine general expenses referable to processing..................................................................................\n1,637,559.48\nDepreciation\u2014processing plant at 25%......................................................\n6,406,581.66\nProcessing allowance....................................................................................\n2,071,640.36\nAs to \u201cprocessing allowance\u201d, the assessor followed a method which he had adopted some time previously to determine processing allowance for uranium and other ores. This involved determining a value for the Company\u2019s assets devoted in the year to milling, making an allowance for what he considered a fair rate of return thereon (which he placed at 8 per cent), or alternatively 15 per cent of the profit calculated under The Mining Tax Act before processing allowances, deducting whichever figure was the greater. In this case, as he calculated it, the percentage of profit under The Mining Tax Act was greater and amounted to $2,071,640.36.\nThe Company appealed the assessment to the Ontario Municipal Board which held that while the assessor\u2019s method of calculating the \u201cprocessing allowance\u201d of 8 per cent of capital invested in processing assets was proper, he had not applied the 8 per cent to the proper figure. He had applied it to the capital invested at the end of the previous year, December 31, 1956; a further $4,957,571 capital was invested in the year 1957, more than half of it in the first three months of that year, and the Board held that two-thirds of the 1957 investment should be added to the figure for \u201ccapital invested\u201d to which the 8 per cent figure was applied. The Board further held that there should be an addition to the capital figure for \u201cpre-production expenses chargeable to the milling operation.\u201d The Company\u2019s books showed this at $4,106,325, but this included $1,397,000 for interest on borrowed money and $439,224 for financing expenses. The Board decided these two items should be deducted from the book figure of pre-production expenses but that the balance of that item, amounting to $2,270,101, should be added to the capital invested.\nThis increased the deduction from $2,071,640.36 to $2,503,034.48, and, in the end result, reduced the tax from $1,308,115.45 to $1,256,348.17.\nThe Company appealed to the Court of Appeal and the Minister of Mines cross-appealed. The Company asserted that the Ontario Municipal Board had been wrong in not allowing the whole of the pre-production expense as an element of invested capital, i.e., had been wrong in deducting the items for interest and financing costs. The Company succeeded on this ground of appeal.\nThe Company further asserted that in calculating the total deduction referable to milling, the amount expended in 1957 for interest on borrowed capital and financing charges in raising the capital should be deducted as a direct expense. The Court of Appeal accepted this contention in part, allowing as an expense two-thirds of the interest claimed.\nThe effect of the changes made by the Court of Appeal was to reduce the tax payable from $1,256,348.17 (as fixed by the Ontario Municipal Board) to $1,133,115.28.\nFrom this judgment the Minister of Mines appeals and seeks to have the original assessment, made by the assessor, restored. The Company seeks to vary the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which had allowed, as an item of processing expense, two-thirds of the interest paid by the Company in 1957 on borrowed processing capital, by increasing such item to the full amount of such interest paid.\nCounsel on both sides were in agreement, with respect to this item, that there was no valid basis for apportioning the interest expense. The position of counsel for the Minister was that it should not be allowed at all, while counsel for the Company contended that it should be allowed in full.\nExcept with respect to this last item of deduction, I am in agreement with the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nThe assessor, when computing the 8 per cent processing allowance, appears to have excluded from the Company\u2019s milling capital pre-production expenses, on the basis that, by analogy, such expenses could not be taken into account, by virtue of s. 4(4) of the Act, when computing allowable deductions from the value of the output at the pit\u2019s mouth. In my view, however, there is no such analogy.\nSection 4(3) of the Act required the assessor to appraise the value of the output at the pit\u2019s mouth. In making that appraisal the provisions of the statute governing deductions from that figure for mining expenses were not relevant. In adopting the method which he used, which was held to be a proper method, he rightly included, when working back from the value of the concentrate produced from the ore mined in 1957, an allowance of 8 per cent on the Company\u2019s milling capital. In determining that capital it was necessary that he take into account all capital used in the processing which occurred in the year 1957. All of the pre\u2011production expenses in accordance with good accounting practice were properly capitalized by the Company.\nSimilarly, the allowance made by the Board, and approved by the Court of Appeal, of two\u2011thirds of the capital expended for milling in 1957 was properly made, in view of the fact that more than half of the milling capital expended in 1957 was expended in the first three months of that year. Consequently, that proportion of 1957 capital expenditure could properly be considered as having been used for the milling of the ore which produced the concentrate, in 1957, from the value of which the assessor had to work back in making his appraisal of the value of the ore at the pit\u2019s mouth.\nOn the other hand, with respect, I am not in agreement with the decision of the Court of Appeal to allow, as a direct expense of milling, two-thirds of the amount expended by the Company in 1957 for interest paid upon borrowed processing capital. The basis for the decision of the Court of Appeal on this point is stated as follows:\nThe Board considered that an allowance to appellant of two-thirds of the milling capital actually invested in 1957 was a fair and just allowance. It is impossible upon the facts to say that the Board was in error in doing so. I would allow the appellant as an expense of 1957 milling operations the same proportion of 1957 interest paid, namely two-thirds thereof.\nThis reference to what the Board had done relates to the decision of the Board that, for the purpose of determining what should be included in the Company\u2019s milling capital assets on which the 8 per cent processing allowance was computed, it was proper to include two-thirds of capital additions made in 1957. The assessor had made his computation on the basis of milling capital at the end of the year 1956.\nWith respect, it is my view that there is no relationship between that matter and the matter now under consideration. The Company seeks to deduct, as a direct expense, interest charges on borrowed capital devoted to the processing operation. What the Board was dealing with was the amount of capital upon which the 8 per cent processing allowance should be computed.\nWhat the assessor was required to do by s. 4(3) of the Act was to appraise the value of the output at the pit\u2019s mouth. His method of doing this was to work back from the value of the concentrate, by deducting the cost of milling the ore and producing the concentrate. Included in the deductions is the allowance of 8 per cent on milling capital assets. This 8 per cent allowance is computed upon all milling capital, including capital which is borrowed as well as equity capital. It is the means by which, in computation of the tax, recognition is given to the right of the taxpayer to take into account a reasonable rate of return on the capital used in the milling operations.\nIn view of this allowance I do not think it is proper also to allow an outright deduction of interest on borrowed capital. To permit this, in computing the value of the output at the pit\u2019s mouth, for computation of tax, is to say that such value is lesser or greater depending upon the extent to which the milling capital is derived from borrowing or through equity capital. Furthermore, it would permit a taxpayer not only to deduct the interest charges, but also to obtain the benefit of the 8 per cent allowance on the borrowed capital upon which such interest is paid.\nIn my opinion the Company was not entitled to this interest deduction. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, in so far as it relates to this item. The judgment of the Court of Appeal should be varied by deleting from the deductions permitted in determining the value of the output at the pit\u2019s mouth, for computation of tax, the amount of $880,042.66, representing two-thirds of the 1957 interest on borrowed milling capital. The amount of the tax payable by the Company should be varied accordingly. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal. The respondent\u2019s cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed in part, with costs; cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Arnup, Foulds, Weir, Boeckh, Morris & Robinson, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McCarthy & McCarthy, Toronto.\n",

The appellant and her two children entered Canada as non-immigrants some four months after the husband had entered. She applied for permanent residence but never received any advice as to the disposition of her application. At an inquiry held by a special inquiry officer following a report made by an immigration officer concerning her husband, the appellant was called as a witness. Before her evidence was given, the special inquiry officer read the provisions of s. 37(1) of the Immigration Act to her and told her that should a deportation order be issued against her husband, she and her two children could be included in that order. A deportation order was subsequently made against the husband, the appellant and the two children. The Immigration Appeal Board affirmed the deportation order. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the deportation order, in so far as it relates to the wife and children, should be set aside.\nThe deportation order, as against the appellant and the two children, was not valid because of the failure of the special inquiry officer to comply with s. 11 of the Immigration Inquiries Regulations which provides that no person shall be included in a deportation order unless the person has first been given an opportunity of establishing to an immigration officer that she should not be so included. What took place between the special inquiry officer and the appellant when she appeared as a witness at the inquiry was not sufficient compliance with that section. At no point was she told that she had the right to an opportunity to establish that she should not be included in the order.\nImmigration\u2014Non-immigrant acceptant sans permission un emploi\u2014Ordonnance d\u2019expulsion\u2014\u00c9pouse et enfants inclus dans l\u2019ordonnance\u2014Aucune occasion fournie \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pouse de prouver qu\u2019elle et ses enfants ne doivent pas \u00eatre inclus\u2014Invalidit\u00e9 de l\u2019ordonnance quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pouse et les enfants\u2014Loi sur l\u2019immigration, S.R.C. 1952, c. 325, art. 23, 37(1)\u2014R\u00e8glements sur l\u2019immigration, art. 34(3)(e)\u2014R\u00e8glements sur les enqu\u00eates de l\u2019immigration, art. 11.\nLe mari de l\u2019appelante est entr\u00e9 au Canada \u00e0 titre de non-immigrant, et, alors que sa demande pour y r\u00e9sider en permanence \u00e9tait en suspens, il a accept\u00e9 sans permission un emploi, contrairement aux R\u00e8glements sur l\u2019immigration et malgr\u00e9 que son passeport sp\u00e9cifiait qu\u2019il ne lui \u00e9tait pas permis d\u2019accepter de l\u2019emploi au Canada.

Appel accueilli.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Immigration Appeal Board affirming a deportation order. Appeal allowed.\nN.A. Endicott, for the appellants.\nA. Garneau, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal, with leave of this Court, from a decision of the Immigration Appeal Board, which dismissed the appeal of the appellant, and of her two children, from a deportation order made by a Special Inquiry Officer, on December 6, 1968, which included them in the order made against the appellant\u2019s husband, John Moshos.\nJohn Moshos, who was born in Greece on December 1, 1936, is a naturalized citizen of Australia, to which country he had emigrated when he was eighteen years old. He married the appellant in Australia in 1959. She was also born in Greece and is an Australian citizen. Their two infant children were born in Australia.\nEarly in 1966 he returned to Greece, his wife having preceded him, as her mother was not well. While in Greece he decided to travel to Canada. He completed an application for permanent admission to Canada, while he was in Greece, but says he did not receive a letter of refusal. He says that he was advised by an immigration officer, in Athens, that, as a British subject and an Australian citizen, he could go to Canada as a tourist, and apply, in Canada, for permanent admission.\nHe entered Canada on November 22, 1967, as a non-immigrant. He had about $1,500. He applied for permanent admission on January 2, 1968. His passport was endorsed \u201cnot permitted to take employment in Canada\u201d.\nThe appellant and the two children entered Canada on March 9, 1968, as non-immigrants. She applied on March 19 for permanent residence and was interviewed by the immigration authorities on April 19. She has never received any advice as to the disposition of this application. Her trade is that of a carpet weaver, at which she had worked for five or six years in Australia, except for the times she could not work because of her pregnancies.\nThe husband\u2019s finances were not sufficient to enable him to support his wife and children without earning an income. He says that he applied to the immigration authorities for permission to work on three occasions, but received no reply to his request. Finally, he had to take employment, without permission.\nOn August 13, 1968, an immigration officer made a report concerning the husband, pursuant to s. 23 of the Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 325, and on December 6, 1968, an inquiry was held by a Special Inquiry Officer, as required by the Act as a result of that report.\nThe appellant was called as a witness by the Special Inquiry Officer. She was not present while her husband was testifying. After being sworn, and before her evidence was given, the following occurred:\nBY: Special Inquiry Officer to Witness:\nQ. Mrs. Moshos, do you speak English as well as your husband, or do you have difficulty?\nA. I speak a little.\nI would like to remind you that if you do not understand any of the questions that I ask you, we have an interpreter here, Mrs. Daskalakis, and will have her translate the questions into Greek before you answer them if you are not absolutely sure.\nQ. What is your correct name, in full?\nA. Roula Moshos.\nQ. What was your maiden name?\nA. Chrisostomou.\nQ. Are you the wife of John Moshos concerning whom this Inquiry is being held?\nA. Yes. Mrs. Moshos, subsection (1) of section 37 of the Immigration Act reads as follows:\n\u201cWhere a deportation order is made against the head of the family, all dependent members of the family may be included in such order and deported under it\u201d.\nBY: Counsel (who was Mr. Amourgis):\nAt this particular point I would like to make a submission to you sir that it not be interpreted by you or anyone else that I am appearing on behalf of this witness and I have come here only for the purpose of defending the rights of Mr. John Moshos so as an amicus curiae I would like to make the following submission that this particular lady might want to retain a lawyer to protect her rights in the event some of the facts used in this inquiry be used at a much later date against her. On her behalf I take the liberty of asking the protection of the Canada Evidence Act for all answers she might give in this inquiry that will tend to incriminate her or be used against her at any later proceedings. If this witness is brought on behalf of the Immigration Department, I, as counsel, to John Moshos reserve my right to cross examine her on the evidence she might give pertaining to my client\u2019s inquiry. Thank you.\nBY: Special Inquiry Officer to Witness:\nIn view of this section of the Regulations, in the event a deportation order is issued against your husband it may be necessary on the basis of the evidence that we wish you to give now to include you and the children in such deportation order.\nQ. Do you understand that?\nA. Yes, of course.\nQ. As your husband\u2019s counsel has pointed out, he is not prepared to act for you and you do have the right to be represented by counsel yourself. Do you wish to secure counsel?\nA. Yes, Mr. Amourgis.\nQ. Mr. Amourgis is not prepared to accept you as a client at this time?\nA. Why, I have to get a lawyer.\nQ. Do you wish to secure other counsel before giving evidence?\nA. No, I do not want a lawyer.\nQ. In the event Mr. Amourgis is not prepared to act as counsel, do you wish to proceed with the giving of evidence without counsel?\nA. Yes.\nFollowing the inquiry, a deportation order was made against the husband, the appellant and the two children. The basic ground for the deportation order against the husband was that he had taken employment, without the written approval of an officer of the Department, contrary to s. 34(3) (e) of the Immigration Regulations.\nSection 34(3) of the Regulations reads as follows:\n34. (3) Notwithstanding section 28, an applicant in Canada who (a) if outside Canada would be an independent applicant; and (b) is not in possession of an immigrant visa or letter of pre-examination but, in the opinion of an immigraton officer, would on application be issued a visa or letter of pre-examination if outside Canada;\nmay be admitted to Canada for permanent residence if\n(c) he complies with the requirements of the Act and these Regulations;\n(d) he makes application in the form prescribed by the Minister before the expiration of the period of temporary stay in Canada authorized for him by an immigration officer;\n(e) he has not taken employment in Canada without the written approval of an officer of the Department; and\n(f) in the opinion of an immigration officer, he would have been admitted to Canada for permanent residence if he had been examined outside Canada as an independent applicant and assessed in accordance with the norms set out in Schedule A, except with respect to arranged employment.\nWith respect to the appellant and the children the deportation order was based upon s. 37(1) of the Act which provides:\n37. (1) Where a deportation order is made against the head of a family, all dependent members of the family may be included in such order and deported under it.\nBoth the husband and the appellant appealed, without success, to the Immigration Appeal Board. The appellant appeals to this Court from the Board\u2019s decision.\nAn appeal to this Court is limited, by s. 23 of the Immigration Appeal Board Act, 1966-67 (Can.), c. 90, to a question of law, including a question of jurisdiction. In my opinion the deportation order, as against the appellant and the two children, was not valid because of the failure of the Special Inquiry Officer to comply with s. 11 of the Immigration Inquiries Regulations. That section provides as follows:\n11. No person shall, pursuant to subsection (1) of section 37 of the Act, be included in a deportation order unless the person has first been given an opportunity of establishing to an immigration officer that he should not be so included.\nI have already quoted that which took place between the Special Inquiry Officer and the appellant when she appeared as a witness at the inquiry. In my opinion there was not a sufficient compliance with this section. The appellant\u2019s status at that inquiry was as a witness in an inquiry concerning John Moshos. She was not there throughout the inquiry.\nIt is true that the Special Inquiry Officer read the provisions of s. 37(1) to her and told her that \u201cin view of this section of the Regulations (sic), in the event a deportation order is issued against your husband it may be necessary on the basis of the evidence that we wish you to give now to include you and the children in such deportation order\u201d He also asked her if she wished to secure counsel \u201cbefore giving evidence\u201d. He then proceeded to question her.\nHowever, at no point was she told that she had the right to an opportunity to establish that she should not be included in the order. I do not regard the mere reading of s. 37(1) to her, when she was on the stand as a witness, followed by questioning by the Special Inquiry Officer, as constituting the giving of such an opportunity.\nIn my opinion the deportation order was made against the appellant and the children without complying with s. 11 of the Immigration Inquiries Regulations. In view of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to consider the other grounds of appeal submitted on behalf of the appellants.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed and the deportation order, in so far as it relates to the appellant and the children, should be set aside.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Endicott & Rothman, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.S. Maxwell, Ottawa.\n",

The union applied to the Court of Appeal for a writ of mandamus, requiring the Board to exercise its jurisdiction under s. 5(a), (b) and (c) of The Trade Union Act, R.S.S. 1965, c. 287, as amended 1966, c. 83, in respect of the union\u2019s application; for a writ of certiorari; and for an order quashing the order of the Board. The application was granted and the company and the Board then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the order of the Board restored.\nUnder The Trade Union Act, the Board had exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether or not a proposed unit of employees was appropriate for collective bargaining. In determining that issue the Board was not subject to any directions contained in the Act and it could, therefore, consider any factors which might be relevant.\nThe Court of Appeal erred in holding that the Board had dismissed the application on a ground which was wholly irrelevant and had declined to exercise its jurisdiction. What the Board did do was to take into consideration, when determining whether the proposed unit of employees was appropriate for collective bargaining, and whether the union represented a majority of employees in that unit, the nature of the company\u2019s business, the fact that it was at its inception, and the fact that it was expected to increase its labour force enormously within a year. This it was entitled to do, and its decision, based on those and other factors, was not subject to review by the Court.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], quashing an order of the Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan and issuing a peremptory writ of mandamus to the Board to determine, according to law, an application for certification. Appeal allowed and order of the Board restored.\nD.K. MacPherson, Q.C., for the appellant company.\nMichael Chan, for the appellant Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan.\nG.J.D. Taylor, Q.C., for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan1, which quashed an order of the Labour Relations Board of the Province of Saskatchewan (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Board\u201d) and issued a peremptory writ of mandamus to the Board to determine, according to law, the application of the United Steelworkers of America, C.L.C. (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Union\u201d), to become the representative of a unit of employees of the appellant company (hereinafter referred to as \u201cNoranda\u201d), for the purpose of bargaining collectively.\nThe Union\u2019s application to the Board was made on November 28, 1968. The proposed unit of employees comprised all employees of Noranda\u2019s Potash Division at its mine site near Colonsay, Saskatchewan, except managers, superintendents, foremen, office and clerical staff, plant security, and any person having and regularly exercising authority to employ or discharge employees or regularly acting on behalf of management in a confidential capacity.\nThe application asked the Board to determine: that this was an appropriate unit of employees for the purpose of bargaining collectively; and that the Union represented a majority of the employees in that unit; and to require Noranda to bargain collectively with it.\nBy a majority decision, the Board, on January 11, 1969, ordered that the application be dismissed. The order stated that the majority of the Board found that, in this particular case, the number of employees employed by Noranda, at the filing date of the application, did not constitute a substantial and representative segment of the working force to be employed in the future by Noranda.\nIn the reasons delivered by the majority of the Board, the following statement is made:\nAs of November 28, 1968, the date of this application, there were 23 employees only in the bargaining unit applied for and as of the date of hearing, namely, January 7, 1969, there were 25 employees in the bargaining unit. The Respondent Company estimated that the full complement of employees in December, 1969, will number approximately 326. There was no evidence to indicate that the proposed full complement of employees would not be reached by the estimated date or that their reaching this complement depended on foreseeable factors outside the control of the Respondent that might cause them to not reach then-targeted complement of employees by the said date.\n* * *\nThe problem the Board is faced with in this type of application is balancing the right of present employees to be represented by a union for the purpose of bargaining collectively and the rights of future employees to select a bargaining agent as was stated in the Emil. Frants and Peter Wasilowich case, Volume 1 (1944-1959) C.L.L.C. Paragraph 18057, and applied by this Board in the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local Union No. 2038 and ITT Canada Limited case, 1967 C.L.L.C. Paragraph 16016.\nThe Board, in coming to its decision, must consider the type of operation, the segment of the employees employed in the proposed bargaining unit at time of application, the total number of employees estimated there will be in the proposed bargaining unit, and the date at which the proposed build-up will be achieved.\nThe minority of the Board took the position that the \u201cprinciple\u201d applied by the majority was in direct contradiction to the provisions of The Trade Union Act, R.S.S. 1965, c. 287, as amended. It was their view that:\nIn this case the basic requirements to obtain certification under The Trade Union Act were present.\n1. There was an \u201cEmployer\u201d.\n2. There were a number of \u201cEmployees\u201d.\n3. An appropriate bargaining unit had been set out and agreed upon.\n4. There was clear cut evidence of support.\n5. All forms had been filed in proper order.\nThe Union applied to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan for a writ of mandamus requiring the Board to exercise its jurisdiction under s. 5(a), (b) and (c) of the above Act, in respect of the Union\u2019s application; for a writ of certiorari; and for an order quashing the order of the Board.\nThis application was granted. The reasons for so doing are stated in the following passages from the judgment of the Court:\nLearned counsel for both the employer and the Labour Relations Board contended that the order of the Board must be construed as a determination by the Board that the unit of employees described in the application did not constitute an appropriate unit for the purpose of bargaining collectively; that such determination was a matter wholly within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction and therefore not subject to review, either in certiorari or mandamus proceedings.\nIf the order made by the Board were one within its jurisdiction, then even if wrong in law or fact, the order would not be open to judicial review. Farrell et al. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, [1962] S.C.R. 48. Too, if the decision of the Board could be construed as contended for by learned counsel for the employer, and the Board, a strong argument might be advanced that the decision, even if wrong, cannot be questioned in these proceedings. In my respectful view, however, the decision of the Board cannot be construed as a determination that the unit of employees described in the application do not constitute an appropriate unit for the purpose of bargaining collectively. Clearly, the Board dismissed the application because, in its opinion, the number of employees employed by the employer at the time of the application, did not constitute a substantial and representative segment of the working force to be employed in the future. There was no finding that the unit of employees described in the application was not an appropriate unit, nor was there any finding that the applicant union did not represent a majority of employees in such unit. What the Board in fact did, was to dismiss the application because, in its opinion, the time for making the same was not appropriate.\n* * *\nWhile the language of section 5(a), (b) and (c) is permissive in form, it imposes the duty upon the Board to exercise the powers when called upon to do so, by a party interested and having the right to make the application. In the present case, the right of the union to make the application, and that the union represents a majority of employees in the proposed unit, were never questioned.\nWhen the application was made, it was the duty of the Board to hear the application and to give effect to the statutory rights of the employees. While the Board considered the application, it failed to direct its consideration to the rights of the employees as provided for in The Trade Union Act and rejected the application on a ground which was wholly irrelevant. By so doing, in my opinion, the Labour Relations Board declined to exercise the jurisdiction and to perform the duties imposed upon it by the section of the Act I have quoted.\nFrom this judgment Noranda and the Board have appealed to this Court.\nThe relevant provisions of the Act are the following:\n3. Employees shall have the right to organize in and to form, join or assist trade unions and to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and the representatives designated or selected for the purpose of bargaining collectively by the majority of employees in a unit appropriate for that purpose shall be the exclusive representatives of all employees in that unit for the purpose of bargaining collectively.\n5. The board shall have power to make orders:\n(a) determining whether the appropriate unit of employees for the purpose of bargaining collectively shall be an employer unit, craft unit, plant unit, professional association unit or a subdivision thereof or some other unit;\n(b) determining what trade union, if any, represents a majority of employees in an appropriate unit of employees;\n(c) requiring an employer or a trade union representing the majority of employees in an appropriate unit to bargain collectively;\n20. There shall be no appeal from an order or decision of the board under this Act, and its proceedings, orders and decisions shall not be reviewable by any court of law or by any certiorari, mandamus, prohibition, injunction or other proceeding whatever.\nSection 3 is the primary section of the Act, giving to employees the right to organize and to bargain collectively, through representatives of their own choosing, \u201cin a unit appropriate for that purpose.\u201d Whether or not a unit is appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining is a matter which requires determination, and, while s. 5(a) is not as clearly worded, in this connection, as it might be, it is my view that, reading ss. 3, 5(a) and 5(b) together, the Act obviously contemplates that the determination of that question is for the Board. By virtue of s. 20, the jurisdiction of the Board in this matter is made exclusive. Therefore, as is pointed out in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, if the order in question here is within that jurisdiction, it is not open to judicial review because of error, whether of law or fact: Farrell et al. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, supra, at p. 51.\nThe Court of Appeal was of the view that the Board\u2019s order was not made within its jurisdiction, because, in the opinion of the Court, it did not thereby determine that the proposed unit of employees was not appropriate for collective bargaining, or that the Union did not represent a majority of the employees in the unit. In the view of the Court, \u201cwhat the Board in fact did, was to dismiss the application because, in its opinion, the time for making the same was not appropriate\u201d. In so doing, it was said, it failed to give effect to the legal rights of the employees conferred by the statute, which it was under a legal obligation to do.\nWith respect, I do not share this view. In my opinion, the Board has jurisdiction under the Act to determine whether or not it considers a proposed unit of employees to be appropriate for collective bargaining. In determining that issue the Board is not subject to any directions contained in the Act and it can, therefore, consider any factors which may be relevant. The application to the Board asked it, inter alia, to determine that the unit described in the application was an appropriate one. The application was dismissed, thereby demonstrating that the Board was not prepared to make that determination in the Union\u2019s favour. The Board ruled on a matter over which it had exclusive jurisdiction.\nThe reasons which were given by the Board for this exercise of its jurisdiction were that the number of em- ployees employed by Noranda at the time the application was made did not constitute a substantial and representative segment of the working force to be employed by Noranda in the future. In my opinion, the Board had full discretion under the Act to take that factor into consideration when considering the application. The expected increase in Noranda\u2019s work force, in the year 1969, from 25 to approximately 326 was a factor of great weight in deciding whether the proposed unit was appropriate and, as provided in s. 5(b), in \u201cdetermining what trade union, if any, represented a majority of employees in an appropriate unit of employees\u201d.\nThat the Board should consider this factor in cases of this kind, in the interests of employees, seems to me to be logical. A union selected by a handful of employees at the commencement of operations might not be the choice of a majority of the expected large work force. The selection of a union at that early stage could be more readily subject to the influence of an employer. A large work force, when a plant went into operation, might comprise employees in various crafts for whom a plant unit, comprising all employees, other than management; might not be appropriate. In my view the Board not only can, but should, consider these factors in reaching its decision when asked to make a determination under s. 5(a) and (b).\nTo summarize the position, in my opinion, with respect, the Court of Appeal erred when it held that the Board had dismissed the application on a ground which was wholly irrelevant and had declined to exercise its jurisdiction. What the Board did do was to take into consideration, when determining whether the proposed unit of employees was appropriate for collective bargaining, and whether the Union represented a majority of employees in that unit, the nature of Noranda\u2019s business, the fact that it was at its inception, and the fact that it was expected to increase its labour force enormously within a year. This it was entitled to do, and its decision, based on those and other factors, is not subject to review by the Court.\nAt the conclusion of the argument of this appeal the Court announced its decision, advising that written reasons would be delivered later. That decision was that the appeal be allowed, that the judgment of the Court of Appeal be set aside and that the order of the Labour Relations Board be restored, with costs to both appellants in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed and order of the Labour Relations Board restored, with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant company: MacPherson, Leslie & Tyerman, Regina.\nSolicitor for the appellant Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan: Roy S.

R., [1969] S.C.R. 905\nDate: 1969-06-02\nBruno Peda (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen (Defendant) Respondent.\n1969: March 11, 12; 1969: June 2.\nPresent: Cartwright C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nCriminal law\u2014Motor vehicles\u2014Dangerous driving\u2014Charge to jury\u2014Section of Code read and paraphrased\u2014Must jury be told that advertent negligence necessary\u2014Effect of previous judgments of Supreme Court of Canada\u2014Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 221(4), 597(l)(a).\nThe appellant was convicted by a jury of dangerous driving. The conviction was affirmed by a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal. An appeal was taken to this Court where it was argued that the directions of the trial judge as to the nature of the offence were inadequate and that it should have been made clear to the jury that the offence involved an element of advertent as opposed to inadvertent negligence. The trial judge simply read and paraphrased s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code.\nHeld (Cartwright C.J. and Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The charge was adequate and correct. Section 221(4) is straightforward and free of ambiguity. It contains its own definition of dangerous driving. It was not necessary to instruct the jury as to the difference between \u201cadvertent\u201d and \u201cinadvertent\u201d negligence. The decision of this Court in Binus v. The Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 594, in which the opinion was expressed that Mann v. The Queen, [1966] S.C.R. 238, had decided that proof of inadvertent negligence was not sufficient to support a conviction under s. 221(4), and that it was necessary to instruct the jury to this effect, was not binding as that opinion was not a necessary step to the judgment pronounced. The Mann case was concerned with constitutional law. The issue in the present case was as to the instruction to be put to a jury. There is nothing in the Mann case which would require the Court, when explaining to the jury the nature of the offence charged, to do so in terms other than those contained in the section itself. Parliament has defined the kind of conduct which shall constitute an offence under that subsection, and this Court, in the Mann case, has said that such definition is not to be construed as creating a crime of inadvertent negligence.\nPer Pigeon and Ritchie JJ.: The instructions were sufficient. The actual decision in Mann v. The Queen was essentially that the offence requires mens rea and therefore differs in nature from statutory offences aimed at specific acts irrespective of intention. The majority opinion in Binus v. The Queen that the jury must be instructed that dangerous driving by inadvertence is not contemplated by the section, is not binding as that case was decided on application of s. 592(1) (b) (iii). Only such instructions need be given as the case being tried actually requires. Although mens rea is always required on the charge, it is only in exceptional circumstances that the jury need instructions in this connection. In most cases the fact itself is sufficient proof of the intention. In this case there was no suggestion of a circumstance from which the jury might infer that the accused\u2019s manner of driving was inadvertently dangerous. The only question therefore was whether the driving was actually dangerous within the meaning of the section. Such being the case, it was not necessary to instruct the jury that the accused should not be found guilty if the accident had occurred by his inadvertence.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Hall and Spence JJ., dissenting: Assuming that, on a strict application of the principle of stare decisis, Binus v. The Queen is not a binding authority as to the manner in which a judge must instruct a jury on a charge under s. 221(4), the combined effect of the judgments of this Court in O\u2019Grady v. Sparling, [1960] S.C.R. 804, and Mann v. The Queen, [1966] S.C.R. 238, is to decide that s. 221(4) does not render \u201cinadvertent negligence\u201d a crime. The enunciation of that legal proposition was a necessary step to the judgment pronounced in both cases. Although this Court has power to depart from the ratio decidendi of both of these cases, there was no ground sufficient to warrant the refusal to follow them. Such a course could result in the re-opening of the question of the constitutional validity of the provincial statutory provisions considered in O\u2019Grady and Mann. So long as it is the law that a necessary ingredient of the offence of dangerous driving is \u201cadvertent negligence\u201d it is essential that the trial judge should so instruct the jury in all cases in which on the evidence they might properly find that the conduct of the accused, while dangerous in fact, did not involve \u201cadvertent negligence\u201d. On the evidence in this case, a properly instructed jury might well have either convicted or acquitted the appellant.\nDroit criminel\u2014Automobile\u2014Conduite dangereuse\u2014Directives au jury\u2014Article du Code lu et paraphras\u00e9\u2014Doit-on dire au jury que la n\u00e9gligence intentionnelle est n\u00e9cessaire\u2014Effet des arr\u00eats ant\u00e9rieurs de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada\u2014Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 221(4), 597(l)(a).

Le juge au proc\u00e8s s\u2019est content\u00e9 de lire et de paraphraser l\u2019art. 221(4) du Code criminel.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, le Juge en Chef Cartwright et les Juges Hall et Spence \u00e9tant dissidents.\nLes Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson et Ritchie: Les directives \u00e9taient ad\u00e9quates et correctes. L\u2019article 221(4) est simple et sans ambigu\u00eft\u00e9. Il contient sa propre d\u00e9finition de la conduite dangereuse. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire que le juge donne des directives sur la diff\u00e9rence entre la n\u00e9gligence intentionnelle et la n\u00e9gligence par inadvertance. L\u2019arr\u00eat de cette Cour dans Binus c. The Queen, [1967] R.C.S. 594, o\u00f9 l\u2019on exprime l\u2019opinion que Mann c. The Queen, [1966] R.C.S. 238, avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que, pour obtenir une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 sous l\u2019art. 221(4), une preuve de n\u00e9gligence par inadvertance n\u2019est pas suffisante et qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de donner des directives \u00e0 cet effet au jury, n\u2019est pas un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent obligatoire parce que cette opinion n\u2019est pas un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel du jugement prononc\u00e9. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mann, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une question de droit constitutionnel. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, il s\u2019agit des directives qui doivent \u00eatre donn\u00e9es au jury. Il n\u2019y a rien dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mann qui exige que la Cour explique au jury la nature de l\u2019infraction en des termes autres que ceux de l\u2019article lui-m\u00eame. Le Parlement a donn\u00e9 une d\u00e9finition du genre de conduite qui constitue une infraction en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 4, et cette Cour, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mann, a dit qu\u2019une telle d\u00e9finition ne doit pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme faisant un crime de la n\u00e9gligence par inadvertance.\nLes Juges Pigeon et Ritchie: Les directives \u00e9taient suffisantes. L\u2019essence de l\u2019arr\u00eat Mann c. The Queen est que l\u2019infraction cr\u00e9\u00e9e par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 4 exige la mens rea et que par cons\u00e9quent elle diff\u00e8re par nature des infractions statutaires visant des actes sp\u00e9cifiques sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019intention. L\u2019opinion majoritaire dans Binus c. The Queen que les directives doivent sp\u00e9cifier que la conduite dangereuse par inattention n\u2019est pas vis\u00e9e par l\u2019article, ne constitue pas un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent obligatoire parce que cette affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par application de l\u2019art. 592(1) (b) (iii). Seules les directives actuellement requises pour les fins du proc\u00e8s doivent \u00eatre donn\u00e9es. Quoique la mens rea soit toujours requise sur une inculpation de conduite dangereuse, ce n\u2019est que dans des circonstances exceptionnelles que des directives \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard doivent \u00eatre donn\u00e9es. Dans la plupart des cas le fait lui-m\u00eame fait preuve de l\u2019intention. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, on ne sugg\u00e8re aucune circonstance de laquelle le jury pourrait conclure que la mani\u00e8re de conduire de l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait dangereuse par inadvertance. La seule question est donc de savoir si la conduite \u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement dangereuse dans le sens de l\u2019article. Tel \u00e9tant le cas, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire que le juge donne des directives que l\u2019accus\u00e9 ne devait pas \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable si l\u2019accident s\u2019\u00e9tait produit par inadvertance.\nLe Juge en Chef Cartwright et les Juges Hall et Spence, dissidents: Prenant pour acquis qu\u2019en vertu de l\u2019application stricte du principe de stare decisis, l\u2019arr\u00eat Binus c. The Queen n\u2019est pas un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent obligatoire au sujet des directives qu\u2019un juge doit donner au jury sur une accusation en vertu de l\u2019art. 221(4), l\u2019effet combin\u00e9 des arr\u00eats de cette Cour dans O\u2019Grady c. Sparling, [1960] R.C.S. 804, et Mann c. The Queen, [1966] R.C.S. 238, est de d\u00e9cider que l\u2019art. 221(4) ne fait pas un crime de la n\u00e9gligence par inadvertance. L\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de cette proposition est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel du jugement prononc\u00e9 dans les deux causes. Quoique cette Cour ait le pouvoir de s\u2019\u00e9carter de la ratio decidendi de ces deux causes, il n\u2019y a aucun motif suffisant pour justifier le refus de s\u2019y conformer. Une telle ligne de conduite pourrait avoir comme r\u00e9sultat de remettre en question la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives provinciales consid\u00e9r\u00e9es dans O\u2019Grady et Mann. Tant que la loi est \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la n\u00e9gligence intentionnelle est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment n\u00e9cessaire de l\u2019infraction de conduite dangereuse, il est essentiel que le juge au proc\u00e8s donne des directives dans ce sens dans tous les cas o\u00f9 les jur\u00e9s peuvent conclure de la preuve que la conduite de l\u2019accus\u00e9, quoique dangereuse en fait, ne comporte pas un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de n\u00e9gligence intentionnelle. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, un jury ayant re\u00e7u des directives ad\u00e9quates aurait pu tout aussi bien acquitter l\u2019appelant que le d\u00e9clarer coupable.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement majoritaire de la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario[1], confirmant une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9. Appel rejet\u00e9, le Juge en Chef Cartwright et les Juges Hall et Spence \u00e9tant dissidents.\nAPPEAL from a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, affirming the appellant\u2019s conviction. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright C.J. and Hall and Spence J.J. dissenting.\nJ.C. Eberle, Q.C., for the appellant.\nM. Manning, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 pronounced on June 20, 1968, dismissing an appeal from the conviction of the appellant of the offence of dangerous driving.\nThe appeal is brought, pursuant to s. 597(1) (a) of the Criminal Code, on the questions of law on which Laskin J.A. dissented in the Court of Appeal.\nThe appellant was tried before His Honour Judge Martin and a jury on an indictment containing two counts (i) driving a motor vehicle while his ability to drive was impaired by alcohol (contrary to s. 223 of the Code) and (ii) dangerous driving (contrary to s. 221(4)). The wording of these counts is set out in full in the reasons of my brother Judson. The appellant was acquitted on the first count and found guilty on the second.\nBoth charges arose out of the same occurrence. The facts are summarized as follows in the reasons of McLennan J.A.:\nThe events giving rise to the two counts occurred about 6:30 a.m. on June 29, 1967. It was raining at the time. The appellant was driving his taxi-cab easterly on the exit lane from the Gardiner Expressway which runs into Lakeshore Boulevard. Between the exit lane and the southerly lane of Lakeshore Boulevard is a narrow strip separating the two lanes. This dividing strip is some inches higher than the level of the exit lane and Lakeshore Boulevard. The two eastbound lanes are separated from the westbound lanes by a median the level of which is higher than the highway.\nThe case for the Crown, on the count of dangerous driving was that the appellant drove his car from the exit lane, across the dividing strip, then across the two eastbound lanes on Lakeshore Boulevard and over the median striking a car being driven westerly on the north side of Lakeshore Boulevard. There is no direct evidence as to the speed at which the appellant was driving but there was evidence from which it might be inferred that the speed was high, the strongest being what happened to the appellant\u2019s car in leaving the exit lane.\nThe appellant gave evidence stating that as he was driving down the exit lane the driver of a car ahead of him, who he said had been driving quite erratically just before the accident, suddenly applied his brakes and he remembers nothing until after the accident occurred. A passenger in his car, a friend of the appellant, gave the same evidence. He, likewise, remembered nothing after seeing the brake lights of the car ahead illuminate suddenly.\nThere was conflicting evidence as to whether or not the appellant\u2019s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol.\nIn answer to a question from the Bench counsel stated that the record does not show what is the maximum rate of speed permitted by law at the point where the appellant\u2019s vehicle went out of control.\nMcLennan J.A. who delivered the main reasons of the majority in the Court of Appeal was of the view that had the appellant offered no evidence the facts summarized above would have constituted sufficient circumstantial evidence to justify a conviction of dangerous driving, that it followed from the verdict of guilty that the jury must have rejected the appellant\u2019s defence, which was that the real cause of the course which his car took was that the sudden application of the brakes by the driver of the car ahead caused the appellant to lose control, or, alternatively, that the jury must have taken the view that the speed at which the appellant was driving was the cause of the accident.\nMacKay J.A. agreed with the reasons of McLennan J.A. and added that the explanation offered by the appellant having been rejected by the jury, \u201cthere was only one rational conclusion to be reached on the evidence\u2014that is that the admittedly dangerous manner in which the accused\u2019s car was driven was due to the advertent negligence on the part of the accused\u201d.\nThe majority examined and rejected the grounds on which Laskin J.A. would have allowed the appeal.\nThe first ground on which Laskin J.A. proceeded was that this Court has decided in Binus v. The Queen[2] that proof of inadvertent negligence is not sufficient to support a conviction of dangerous driving under s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code and, that being so, the charge of the learned trial Judge in the case at bar was inadequate. He concluded his reasons on this point as follows:\n\u2026If advertent negligence is the test I do not see how it can suffice to direct the jury merely in the words of the Statute without additional elaboration. In these circumstances, and having regard to the other facts detailed here as to the course of the trial, I am unable to say that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.\nI have had the advantage of reading the reasons of my brother Judson and, for the purposes of this appeal, am prepared to assume that, on a strict application of the principle of stare decisis, Binus is not a binding authority as to the manner in which a judge must instruct a jury on the trial of a charge under s. 221(4). It appears to me, however, that the combined effect of the judgments of this Court in O\u2019Grady v. Sparling[3] and Mann v. The Queen[4] is to decide that s. 221 (4) does not render \u201cinadvertent negligence\u201d a crime.\nO\u2019Grady was decided prior to the enactment of s. 221(4). My brother Judson, giving the judgment of seven Members of the Court, said at p. 809:\nWhat the Parliament of Canada has done is to define \u2018advertent negligence\u2019 as a crime under ss. 191(1) and 221(1). It has not touched \u2018inadvertent negligence\u201d. Inadvertent negligence is dealt with under the provincial legislation in relation to the regulation of highway traffic. That is its true character and until Parliament chooses to define it in the Criminal Code as \u2018crime\u2019, it is not crime.\nMann\u2019s case arose after the enactment of s. 221(4) and it was sought to distinguish O\u2019Grady on the ground that by s. 221(4) Parliament had made inadvertent negligence a crime. Of the seven Judges who sat in Mann\u2019s case five decided that s. 221 (4) did not create a crime of \u201cinadvertent negligence\u201d. It is sufficient to quote a sentence from the judgment of Ritchie J., concurred in by Martland and Judson JJ.; he said at pp. 250 and 251:\nI have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of my brothers Cartwright and Spence and I agree with them that this appeal should be dismissed and that the provisions of s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code are not to be construed as creating a crime of \u2018inadvertent negligence\u2019.\nThe other two judges who sat in Mann\u2019s case did not find it necessary to express an opinion on this question.\nIt is quite true that in both O\u2019Grady and Mann the question to be decided was whether a section of a provincial Highway Traffic Act was effective, but the conclusion appears to me to be inescapable that the decision that Parliament has not defined \u201cinadvertent negligence\u201d as a crime was the enunciation of a legal proposition which was a necessary step to the judgment pronounced in each case. It follows that unless we are prepared to depart from the ratio decidendi of both of these cases we cannot say that s. 221(4) has created a crime of \u201cdangerous driving\u201d where the manner of driving is in fact dangerous but the conduct of the accused does not amount to \u201cadvertent negligence\u201d (as that expression was used in O\u2019Grady and in Mann).\nAs I said in Binus, with the concurrence of Ritchie and Spence JJ., I do not doubt the power of this Court to depart from previous judgments of its own; but I can find no ground sufficient to warrant our refusing to follow the carefully considered judgments of this Court in O\u2019Grady and in Mann on the point now under consideration and to say that a person can be convicted on a charge under s. 221(4) when his conduct amounted to \u201cinadvertent\u201d but not to \u201cadvertent\u201d negligence. If this Court should take that course the result might well be to make possible the re-opening of the question of the constitutional validity of those provincial statutory provisions considered in O\u2019Grady and in Mann which make \u201ccareless driving\u201d a punishable offence. It must not be forgotten that in the two last mentioned cases we had the advantage of hearing full argument not only from counsel for the parties but also from counsel for the Attorney\u2011General of Canada and for the Attorneys-General of several of the Provinces.\nSo long as it is the law that a necessary ingredient of the offence of dangerous driving is \u201cadvertent negligence\u201d it is essential that the trial judge should so instruct the jury in all cases in which on the evidence they might properly find that the conduct of the accused, while dangerous in fact, did not involve \u201cadvertent negligence\u201d. I do not mean by this that the judge should employ the adjectives \u201cinadvertent\u201d and \u201cadvertent\u201d; but he must, in my view, bring home to the jury that in order to convict they must be satisfied that there was \u201cnegligence of sufficient gravity to lift the case out of the civil field into that of the Criminal Code...something more than mere inadvertence or mere thoughtlessness or mere negligence or mere error of judgment\u201d that there was on the part of the accused \u201cknowledge or willful disregard of the probable consequences or a deliberate failure to take reasonable precautions\u201d. I have taken the words in quotation marks from the judgment of Casey J. in Loiselle v. The Queen[5], The passage in which they occur was quoted in Mann v. The Queen, supra, at p. 245, and I remain of the opinion that I there expressed that Casey J. has stated the law accurately.\nNo doubt there may be cases where evidence of the manner in which an accused did in fact drive may, in the absence of an acceptable explanation, be sufficient evidence to warrant a finding that his conduct involved \u201cadvertent negligence\u201d. The judgment of Laskin J.A. on this first ground does not proceed on the basis that there was not evidence on which it was open to the jury to convict but on the view that in this respect the charge of the learned trial Judge was insufficient.\nSince writing the above I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of my brother Pigeon. I agree with what he says in his analysis of the judgments of this Court in O\u2019Grady and in Mann and with his conclusion that in those cases:\nThe actual decision was essentially that the offence created by subsection 4 (of section 221) requires mens rea and therefore differs in nature from statutory offences aimed at specific acts irrespective of intention.\nThe reason that I differ from his view as to how this first ground of appeal should be disposed of is that, in my opinion, on the evidence in this case a properly instructed jury might well have either convicted or acquitted the appellant.\nAs I agree with Laskin J.A. that this appeal should be allowed on the first ground with which he has dealt, it becomes unnecessary to examine the other grounds on which he based his decision, but I wish to say a few words about them.\nLaskin J.A. described these grounds as follows:\nSecond, whether in view of the single trial on two charges arising out of the same facts the trial judge adequately separated the issues relating to each charge so as to leave the jury with a clear understanding of the relevant law; and, third, whether the acquittal of the accused on the impaired driving charge resulted in an inconsistent verdict of guilty of dangerous driving in the light of the charge which was in fact delivered.\nWhile these two grounds raise questions of law their decision is, of course, closely related to the manner in which this particular case was presented and to the charge to the jury which was in fact delivered.\nWhere both charges arise out of the same occurrence, the acquittal of an accused on a charge of driving while impaired and his conviction on a charge of dangerous driving do not necessarily involve any inconsistency for a person may be perfectly sober and yet drive dangerously. But when the learned trial Judge had said to the jury in the passage quoted by both McLennan J.A. and Laskin J.A.:\nNow, did the accident happen as the accused man has related, that is, that he was forced to apply his brakes suddenly by the sudden stoppage of the car in front of him? Or did the accident happen, did the accused\u2019s car go out of control\u2014and in my opinion the car was completely out of control\u2014or did this car go out of control because the accused was impaired by alcohol and was not in possession of his proper faculties necessary to keep the car under control? As I see it, that is the question which you have to decide and which is entirely a matter for you to do so.\nit appears to me that it was necessary for him to tell them that if they found that the ability of the accused to drive was not impaired by alcohol they could not convict of dangerous driving unless the evidence other than that led to show impairment satisfied them of the guilt of the accused.\nWith the greatest respect I disagree with the following statement of McLennan J.A.:\n\u2026In any event, a verdict of acquittal does not mean that there was no impairment\u2014it means only that the Crown has not established impairment to the satisfaction of the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe law in this regard is, in my opinion, correctly stated by Lord MacDermott giving the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Sambasivam v. Public Prosecutor Federation of Malaya[6], where he said:\nThe effect of a verdict of acquittal pronounced by a competent court on a lawful charge and after a lawful trial is not completely stated by saying that the person acquitted cannot be tried again for the same offence. To that it must be added that the verdict is binding and conclusive in all subsequent proceedings between the parties to the adjudication. The maxim \u2018Res judicata pro veritate accipitur\u2019 is no less applicable to criminal than to civil proceedings. Here, the appellant having been acquitted at the first trial on the charge of having ammunition in his possession, the prosecution was bound to accept the correctness of that verdict and was precluded from taking any step to challenge it at the second trial. And the appellant was no less entitled to rely on his acquittal in so far as it might be relevant in his defence.\nOn the following page Lord MacDermott makes it clear that the result of an accused having been found not guilty of an offence is that he is to be taken to be \u201centirely innocent of that offence\u201d.\nIf in the case at bar there should be a new trial on the charge of dangerous driving, the Crown would be precluded from taking any step to suggest that the accused\u2019s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol and the accused would be entitled to have the jury instructed that they must take it as conclusively established that, at the relevant time, his ability to drive was not so impaired. This principle is not altered, although its application is to some extent complicated, by the circumstance that the two counts were tried together and were both left to the jury at the same time. I agree with what I understand from their reasons to be the view of all the Members of the Court of Appeal that in the case at bar the counts should have been dealt with separately. However, I base my conclusion that the conviction cannot stand on the first ground upon which Laskin J.A. proceeded.\nFor the above reasons I would allow the appeal and quash the conviction. As the view of the majority is that the appeal fails it is unnecessary for me to consider what further order should have been made if the appeal had proved successful.\nFauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. concurred with the judgment delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The appellant was indicted on two counts, which read as follows:\n1. The jurors for Her Majesty the Queen present that Bruno Peda on or about the 29th day of June in the year 1967 at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York, while his ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug, drove a motor vehicle, contrary to the Criminal Code.\n2. The said jurors further present that Bruno Peda on or about the 29th day of June in the year 1967 at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York, drove a motor vehicle on a street highway or other public place, to wit: The Frederick Gardiner Expressway and Lakeshore Boulevard at approximately 6:40 a.m., in a manner that was dangerous to the public to wit: by driving in the wrong lanes, having regard to all the circumstances including the nature, condition and use of such place and the amount of traffic that at that time was or might reasonably have been expected to be on such place, contrary to the Criminal Code.\nHe was tried before a judge and jury. The jury acquitted him on the impaired driving count but convicted him on the dangerous driving count. He was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment. On appeal[7] his conviction was affirmed by a majority, with Laskin J.A. dissenting. He now appeals to this Court and although his appeal was based on a number of grounds, in my view the only one of any substance is the contention that the jury were not properly instructed on the meaning of s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code. He contends that the direction of the trial judge was inadequate with respect to the elements which constitute the charge of dangerous driving and that it should have been made clear that the charge involved an element of advertent as opposed merely to inadvertent, negligence in accordance with what was said by the majority of this Court in Binus v. The Queen[8]. The extent of the direction of the trial judge on this point was to read s. 221(4) to the jury and then to paraphrase it in the following words:\nSo, briefly, it is driving a car on a street, road, highway or other place in a manner that is dangerous to the public, and again, gentlemen, there is really no ambiguity in that language, it is a matter which you will have to decide: was the manner in which the accused drove the car, under the circumstances which have been related to you was it dangerous to the public having regard to all the circumstances?\nIn my opinion this is adequate and correct. The section is straightforward and free of ambiguity. As I pointed out in Binus v. The Queen, it contains its own definition of dangerous driving. The essence of the offence is the manner or character of the accused\u2019s driving, and the section instructs the jury to determine whether he was in fact driving in a manner which was dangerous to the public having regard to all the circumstances, including the nature, condition and use of such place and the amount of traffic that at the time was or might reasonably be expected to be at such place. Their task is to determine the actual behaviour of the driver in the light of the section and while this will necessarily entail some consideration of the state of mind of the driver, as a car does not drive itself, it does not mean that the jury must find that a given state of mind exists before they can convict. This was the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Binus v. The Queen[9], and, as I stated in the same case in this Court, I think that it is the correct one.\nThe decision of this Court in Binus v. The Queen is not a binding authority so as to prevent this conclusion being reached. The accused, in that case, appealed from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario from a conviction for dangerous driving, under s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code. The appeal was heard by a Court of five members and was dismissed by unanimous decision. Three of the five members of the Court did express an opinion which apparently differs from that which is expressed above, to the extent that they were of the opinion that Mann v. The Queen[10] had decided that proof of inadvertent negligence was not sufficient to support a conviction under s. 221(4), and that it was necessary to instruct the jury to this effect. Nevertheless, Cartwright J., as he then was, who delivered the reasons of these three members, went on to say, at p. 602:\nOn the view of the meaning of s. 221(4) of the Code which I have expressed above, I incline to think that the instruction given by the learned trial Judge when the jury were re\u2011called, and particularly the passages which I have italicized, was adequate in the circumstances of this case. Be that as it may, on consideration of all the record I agree with the conclusion of Laskin J.A. that this was a proper case in which to apply the provisions of s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code.\nIt is apparent, therefore, that the opinion expressed as to the effect of Mann v. The Queen was not a necessary step to the judgment pronounced, and is not binding.\nMann v. The Queen was a judgment of this Court as to the constitutional validity of s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172, which defined the offence of careless driving. It was held, unanimously, that this section was validly enacted.\nThe issue was whether this section was in conflict with s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code, which was not in existence when the earlier case of O\u2019Grady v. Sparling[11] was decided, and which had affirmed the constitutional validity of s. 55(1) of the Manitoba Highway Traffic Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 112, which created in that province the offence of driving without due care and attention.\nIn the O\u2019Grady case, it had been said, at p. 809:\nWhat the Parliament of Canada has done is to define \u201cadvertent negligence\u201d as a crime under ss. 191(1) and 221(1). It has not touched \u201cinadvertent negligence.\u201d Inadvertent negligence is dealt with under the provincial legislation in relation to the regulation of highway traffic. That is its true character and until Parliament chooses to define it in the Criminal Code as \u201ccrime\u201d, it is not crime.\nThe contention in the Mann case was that by s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code, Parliament had defined \u201cinadvertent negligence\u201d as a crime.\nCartwright J., with whom Spence J. concurred, held that Parliament had not defined \u201cinadvertent negligence\u201d as a crime, and that the case was indistinguishable from the O\u2019Grady case.\nFauteux J., with whom Abbott and Judson JJ. concurred, held that the provisions of s. 221 (4) of the Criminal Code and of s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act differed in legislative purpose and in legal and practical effect. The provincial enactment imposed a duty to serve bona fide ends not otherwise secured and in no way conflicted with the federal enactment. There were no obstacles to prevent both enactments living together and operating concurrently.\nRitchie J., with whom Martland and Judson JJ. concurred, said that s. 221(4) was not to be construed as creating a crime of \u201cinadvertent negligence\u201d. He went on to say:\nThe purpose and effect of s. 221(4) is to make it a criminal offence for anyone to drive to the public danger but, notwithstanding the careful argument to the contrary addressed to us on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada, I am satisfied that there is a type of careless and inconsiderate driving which falls short of being \u201cdangerous\u201d within the meaning of that section and that the purpose of s. 60 of the Highway Traffic Act is to provide appropriate sanctions for the regulation and control of such driving in the interests of the lawful users of the highways of Ontario.\nThis case was concerned with the constitutionality of the provision in the provincial statute. It was held that it was not in conflict with s. 221(4). In the reasons of Cartwright J. and of Ritchie J. it was held that s. 221(4) did not define a crime of \u201cinadvertent negligence\u201d.\nThe issue in the present case is as to the proper instruction to be put to a jury in a case involving a charge under s. 221(4). It being accepted that that subsection, as framed, does not create a crime of \u201cinadvertent negligence\u201d, there is nothing in the Mann case which would require the Court, when explaining to the jury the nature of the offence charged, to do so in terms other than those contained in the section itself. Parliament has defined the kind of conduct which shall constitute an offence under that subsection, and this Court, in the Mann case, has said that such definition is not to be construed as creating a crime of \u201cinadvertent negligence\u201d. In my opinion, therefore, in this case, the charge to the jury, in the terms of the subsection, was adequate and correct, and it is not necessary, as the appellant contends, for the trial judge to instruct the jury as to the difference between \u201cadvertent\u201d and \u201cinadvertent\u201d negligence.\nI would dismiss the appeal. Ritchie J. concurred with the judgment delivered by\nPIGEON J.:\u2014The appellant was convicted of \u201cdangerous driving\u201d. The conviction was affirmed with a dissent in the Court of Appeal for Ontario[12] and the main question of substance raised on the appeal to this Court is the adequacy of the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury concerning the nature of the offence. He simply read and paraphrased subs. 4 of s. 221 of the Criminal Code without telling them that this did not make inadvertent negligence a crime as this Court has said in Mann v. The Queen[13]. I agree with Judson J. that those instructions were sufficient in this case and I wish to add the following observations.\nPrior to the enactment of subs. 4 of s. 221 this Court, in O\u2019Grady v. Sparling[14], dealt with subs. 1 of the same section, that makes it an offence to be \u201ccriminally negligent in the operation of a motor vehicle\u201d, that is, by virtue of s. 191(1), to drive with \u201cwanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons\u201d. Judson J. speaking for the majority of the Court, after stating (at p. 808) that between \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d thus defined and negligence as contemplated in the enactments of regulatory authorities there is \u201ca difference in kind and not merely one of degree\u201d, adopted as part of his reasons J.W.C. Turner\u2019s statement of this difference (Kenny\u2019s Outlines of Criminal Law, 17th ed., p. 34) in which he says:\nThere are only two states of mind which constitute mens rea, and they are intention and recklessness.\nTherefore the essential basis on which subsection 1 was held to be aimed at a kind of negligence different from the negligence contemplated in the enactments of regulatory authorities is that \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d requires mens rea. It follows, of course, that inadvertent negligence is not criminal. Because negligence in the usual language includes both advertent and inadvertent negligence, it is obvious that in charging a jury on an indictment for \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d a judge must in some way explain adequately the kind of negligence that is criminal and make it clear, but not necessarily in those words, that inadvertent negligence is not criminal. It may well be that he can do it by using the language of s. 191(1), seeing that \u201cwanton or reckless\u201d undoubtedly exclude mere inadvertence.\nWhen in Mann v. The Queen this Court had subsequently to consider subs. 4 making \u201cdangerous driving\u201d a lesser offence, the question arose whether inadvertent negligence consisting in dangerous driving had thereby been made a crime. Following the principle established in Beaver v. The Queen[15] and The Queen v. King[16] it was, in effect, decided that mens rea was an element of the offence of \u201cdangerous driving\u201d as of other criminal offences generally. This was expressed by Cartwright J. (as he then was) by saying (at p. 246) \u201cthat in enacting s. 221(4) Parliament had not defined \u2018inadvertent negligence\u2019 as a crime\u201d and by Ritchie J. (at p. 251) by saying similarly that \u201cthe provisions of s. 221(4) of the Criminal Code\u201d are not to be construed as creating a crime of \u201cinadvertent negligence\u201d.\nIn the context of a decision respecting the constitutional validity of provincial enactments with which subs. 4 was alleged to be in conflict, this mode of expression was, it appears to me, perfectly appropriate. However, because \u201ca case is only an authority for what it actually decides\u201d, one should not read what was thus written as if it was an enactment but ascertain what was actually decided. It seems clear that the actual decision was essentially that the offence created by subs. 4 requires mens rea and therefore differs in nature from statutory offences aimed at specific acts irrespective of intention.\nThis construction, it should be noted, does not deprive subs. 4 of its effect. By virtue of s. 191(1), a conviction for \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d requires \u201cwanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons\u201d. As against that, subs. 4 contemplates danger to other persons only. There is, therefore, ample room for distinction between the two offences even excluding inadvertence from the lesser.\nHowever, wantonness and recklessness of themselves clearly imply the exclusion of mere inadvertence while \u201cdangerous driving\u201d does not necessarily. Does this mean that in a jury trial on that latter charge the judge must necessarily instruct the jurors that dangerous driving by inadvertence is not contemplated? A majority of the members of this Court sitting in Binus v. The Queen[17] expressed that opinion, however as the case was decided by application of s. 592(1) (b) (iii), this is not binding. With great deference to them, I must disagree because only such instructions need be given as the case being tried actually requires. Although mens rea is always required, it is only in exceptional circumstances that the jury need instructions in this connection. In most cases the fact itself is sufficient proof of the intention. It is only when a question arises as to the existence of this element of the offence that the jury need be bothered with it.\nTherefore, in my view, the practical question is whether, in the circumstances of this case, there was something from which the jury might reasonably have concluded that, although objectively considered the accused\u2019s driving was \u201cdangerous\u201d, it could be unconsciously so or be attributable to inadvertence. The only fact from which such an inference might be considered possible in this case is the sudden braking of the car ahead on the exit ramp, assuming accused\u2019s story of how the accident occurred was believed by the jury. Bearing in mind that the accused admitted being aware of the presence of the car ahead, his loss of control of his own car could not possibly be considered the normal result of a sudden application of the brakes by the other car. This result could only obtain if he was driving dangerously. When one is not driving dangerously, he does not lose control of his car because the driver of the car ahead suddenly puts on the brakes especially on an exit ramp where this is to be anticipated.\nI fail to see in the present case any suggestion of a circumstance from which the jury might infer that the accused\u2019s manner of driving was inadvertently dangerous. If he had bumped into the car ahead and said that he had failed to notice that the latter was stopping, a question would have arisen whether this was inadvertent. It might equally have been so if he had said that he had not immediately noticed the braking action due to momentary inattention. Nothing of the kind was suggested and therefore, the only question was whether the driving was actually dangerous within the meaning of the section. Such being the case, it was not necessary for the judge to instruct the jury that the accused should not be found guilty if the accident had occurred by his inadvertence. There was nothing to suggest that the ordinary rule ought not to be applied, namely that one must be deemed to intend to do what he is actually doing.\nAlthough this may not be strictly necessary, I wish to add that, in my opinion, it would not be desirable when there is a need for instructions on the question of intention, to do it by saying that subsection 4 is not aimed at inadvertent negligence. While this wording was entirely appropriate in the context of the constitutional question that was decided in the Mann case, I feel it should be avoided in addressing a jury. My reason for this is that Parliament has created two distinct offences: one of \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d, the other of \u201cdangerous driving\u201d. Although \u201cdangerous driving\u201d is admittedly a kind of \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d because it is a lesser offence than that which is described by those words, the use of the word \u201cnegligence\u201d appears to me highly undesirable in any instructions to a jury with respect to subsection 4 as being apt to create confusion.\nBeing of opinion that the jury was properly instructed in the terms of the section creating the offence of dangerous driving without any reference to negligence, the evidence respecting impairment became irrelevant to that charge. It was, therefore, unnecessary to add that if the accused was acquitted on the count of impairment that evidence should be excluded from consideration on the other count.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed, CARTWRIGHT C.J. and HALL and SPENCE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Goodman & Goodman, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney General for Ontario, Toronto.\n[1] [1969] 1 O.R. 90. 4 C.R.N.S. 161.\n[2] [1967] S.C.R. 594, 2 C.R.N.S. 118, [1968] 1 C.C.C. 227.\n[3] [1960] S.C.R. 804, 33 C.R. 293, 33 W.W.R. 360, 128 C.C.C. 1, 25 D.L.R.

Goodman (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1968: June 7, 11, 12; 1969: June 16.\nPresent: Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nReal property\u2014Mortgages\u2014Developer conveying apartment building to company and taking back second mortgage\u2014Exclusive right of occupancy of individual suites sold to proprietary lessees\u2014Whether priority of interest conveyed to proprietary lessees over that of assignee of second mortgage.\nOn June 15, 1959, F entered into an agreement with B Ltd. for the sale to B Ltd. of a parcel of land on which he had commenced the construction of an apartment building. B Ltd. had recently been incorporated by F, and, at the time was controlled by him. B Ltd. agreed to buy the lands and premises with the apartment building \u201ccompleted and equipped\u201d for $844,500, which was to be paid by the assumption of a first mortgage on the premises in the amount of $310,000 and the sale of the exclusive right of occupancy of the apartment suites. Such sales were to be in accordance with the terms set out in a form of offer to purchase attached to the agreement. F agreed to accept as security a second mortgage if B Ltd. could not pay him the balance of the purchase price in cash on the closing date. As a further protection it was stipulated in the agreement that F was to be entitled to retain possession of all unsold suites until he had been paid in full.\nThe offer to purchase, which incorporated by reference a form of agreement and lease, contemplated the sale by B Ltd. of the exclusive right of occupancy of a suite in the apartment building and that one share of B Ltd. was to be issued in respect of each dollar paid by the purchaser who could make payment either wholly in cash or partly in cash and the balance by assuming part of the total mortgage encumbrance against the apartment premises.\nAlthough the appellant purchasers went into possession of their suites in accordance with the terms of the agreement and lease, the document itself was not signed by any of them until the amount of the second mortgage had been determined. The executed agreements were dated April 1, 1960, which was one day after the date of the deed to B Ltd. and the second mortgage to F Ltd., the nominee of F, and twenty-five days prior to the recording of the latter document.\nIn 1961 the second mortgage was assigned for value to one S in trust and in 1963 was assigned by S without consideration to the respondent. At the time S took he had full knowledge of all dealings between the F companies and the appellants.\nAs a result of having recovered a judgment nisi against B Ltd. for foreclosure of the second mortgage, the respondent demanded that from April 1, 1964, the appellants should vacate their respective suites or enter into a rental determined by him. Following their refusal to comply with his demand, the respondent brought an action for possession of the suites and for payment of occupation rent with respect thereto. The appellants claimed the right to retain possession so long as they made the payments stipulated in their agreements with B Ltd. At trial, it was held that they were licensees, with a contractual right to exclusive possession which they could maintain against the respondent. The respondent\u2019s appeal was allowed by unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal. From that judgment an appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld (Martland J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the trial judgment restored.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.: Each of the appellants acquired by way of purchase an equitable title to the exclusive right of occupancy of their respective suites and to quiet possession thereof so long as they remained the owner of the shares allotted to them in B Ltd. and were not in default under the terms of the agreement and lease.\nThe question of priority as between the interests of the appellants and that of the respondent was dependent upon the nature of the interest vested in B Ltd. at the time when the second mortgage was executed on March 31, 1960. It was apparent that on that date when F executed the deed to B Ltd. he had, in concert with that company and in accordance with the terms of the agreement of sale, already divested himself of the interest conveyed to the appellants and that this was well known and accepted by F Ltd. and by the successive holders of the second mortgage. It followed that the interests conveyed to the appellants were no longer the property of B Ltd. to mortgage, and that the property mortgaged to F Ltd. was then encumbered to the extent of the suites which it had sold.\nUnder the special circumstances of this case the equities against the recognition of an outstanding vendor\u2019s lien outweighed those in favour of it. The second mortgage was a security which was entirely independent of the lien and which was from the very outset contemplated as being accepted by F as full payment and therefore as a substitution for any unpaid vendor\u2019s lien which might otherwise have been outstanding.\nAccordingly, the judgment nisi rendered in favour of the respondent against B Ltd. for foreclosure of the second mortgage did not clothe him with any right to disturb the appellants in the quiet enjoyment of the apartment suites acquired by them pursuant to the agreement of sale and the offer to purchase and agreement and lease which were annexed thereto.\nPer Martland J., dissenting: The agreement of June 15, 1959, contemplated that, in entering into agreements for the occupancy of suites, B Ltd. could only do so on the basis of an agreement with the occupants which specifically recognized the existence of a second mortgage on the whole of the lands and premises. B Ltd., in dealing with the appellants, carried out this obligation. The fact that most of the appellants took possession of their suites before signing the final agreements with B Ltd. did not alter the position, in view of the fact that each suite occupant did sign such an agreement, which, by its terms, replaced all prior agreements, and which specifically acknowledged the amount of the second mortgage against the whole of the lands and premises. The position was, therefore, that B Ltd. could not grant any right or interest in the lands which was not subject to the second mortgage, and that, in fact, it never purported to do so.\nThe agreement of B Ltd. to give a second mortgage to secure the balance of the purchase price was performed, and the second mortgage was executed and registered. The second mortgagee, therefore, had equitable rights prior to any rights of the appellants, which mortgagee\u2019s rights, in due course, were assigned to the respondent.\nAlso, as held by the Court below, the submission that there was an equitable estoppel which precluded F, and his successors, from asserting priority for the second mortgage as against the appellants should fail.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Donnelly J. Appeal allowed, Martland J. dissenting.\nA.S. Pattillo, Q.C., and J.W. Garrow, for the defendants, appellants.\nS.L. Robins, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought with leave of this Court from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 which allowed an appeal by the respondent from a judgment of Donnelly J., whereby he had dismissed the respondent\u2019s action against the appellants for possession of certain apartment suites occupied by them and for payment of occupation rent with respect thereto.\nThe respondent\u2019s claim was asserted as the result of his having recovered a judgment nisi against Hamilton Benvenuto Apartments Limited (hereinafter called Benvenuto) for foreclosure of a second mortgage dated March 31, 1960, and recorded on April 26 of that year, made by Benvenuto as mortgagor in favour of Frisina Enterprises (Hamilton) Limited (hereinafter called Frisina Enterprises), which second mortgage was assigned for value to one Samuel Stein in trust and by him assigned without consideration to the respondent who is his partner. The Benvenuto Company, of which all the appellants are shareholders, was the owner of an apartment building in which they all occupied apart- ment suites, the exclusive right of occupancy to which had been sold to each of them in accordance with certain agreements which will hereafter be discussed.\nThe practical question here at issue between the parties is whether or not the interests purchased by the appellants in the Benvenuto apartment building should take priority over the respondent\u2019s interest as assignee of the second mortgage. The learned trial judge found that the appellants had acquired a licence to occupy their apartments coupled with a contractual interest of which the respondent had full notice when he took the assignment of the second mortgage, and that the appellants\u2019 title therefore took precedence over that of the respondent; whereas Mr. Justice Laskin, in the reasons for judgment which he rendered on behalf of the Court of Appeal, treated the appellants as having acquired no interest in land which could take precedence over the respondent\u2019s mortgage and found that in any event there was an outstanding interest by way of unpaid vendor\u2019s lien to which the respondent fell heir as the assignee of the second mortgage and that this took priority over any interest which the appellants may have acquired.\nThis litigation arises out of the implementation of a plan or scheme devised by one Alfonso Frisina in the spring of 1959 for financing the construction and operation of a 48-suite apartment building to be erected on property owned by him in Hamilton. As will hereafter appear, Frisina\u2019s plan was to a great extent modelled on the type of co-operative housing arrangement which in the past has been more commonly used in the United States of America than in this country, but it will be seen that the method here employed departed in certain essential respects from the procedure which is usually employed in such cases.\nThe essence of the Frisina scheme can best be explained by reference to the agreement of sale dated June 15, 1959, by which he conveyed the apartment building to Benvenuto, a company which had then issued only five shares, all of which were owned or controlled by Frisina.\nThe agreement discloses that Frisina had mortgaged the premises in August, 1958, in the amount of $310,000 to the London Life Insurance Company and had commenced the construction of the apartment building. Benvenuto agreed to buy the lands and premises with the apartment building \u201ccompleted and equipped\u201d for $844,500, which was to be paid by the assumption of the London Life mortgage and the sale of the exclusive right of occupancy of the apartment suites, and it was provided also that:\nIf on the closing of the transaction herein the Company is unable to pay to the vendor the whole of the balance due on closing, namely, Five Hundred and Thirty-Four Thousand and Five Hundred Dollars ($534,500.00)...then on account of such deficiency and to the extent of such deficiency the vendor agrees to take back a second mortgage on the said lands and premises and the said forty-eight suite apartment building.\nIn order to afford greater security to Frisina, the vendor, it was also provided:\n\u2026that until all the suites in the said forty-eight suite apartment building shall have been sold and the vendor shall have been paid the full balance of the purchase of the said apartment building and premises as aforesaid, then the vendor shall be entitled to retain possession of all such unsold suites upon payment to the Company of the monthly operating charge, as referred to and defined in the said Offer to Purchase (appendix A), designated in respect to such unsold suites and the vendor shall further be entitled to sell the same to such person or persons as the said vendor may deem fit,\u2026\nIn my view the paramount condition pursuant to which the company was to acquire title under this agreement is that contained in para. 7 which reads:\nThe Company agrees to sell the exclusive right of occupancy of the suites in the said forty-eight suite apartment building at the prices shown in and in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the form of Offer to Purchase attached hereto as Appendix A.\nIt is important in considering the nature of the title which Benvenuto conveyed to the purchasers of suites to bear in mind the fact that their occupancy was in all cases controlled by the terms of an \u201cOffer to Purchase\u201d which incorporated by reference a form of \u201cagreement and lease\u201d which was designed to be executed before possession was taken but which was in fact not signed by any of the appellants until some considerable time later. It is enough to say of the form of \u201cOffer to Purchase\u201d that it clearly contemplated the sale by Benvenuto of the \u201cexclusive right of occupancy\u201d of a \u201csuite in the apartment building known as Benvenuto Apartments\u201d and that one share of the Benvenuto Company was to be issued in respect of each dollar paid by the purchaser who could make payment either wholly in cash or partly in cash and the balance \u201cby assuming part of the total mortgage encumbrance against the said apartment building premises\u201d. The terms of the form of \u201cagreement and lease\u201d, however, require closer examination. Throughout this document the purchasers are referred to as \u201cproprietary lessees\u201d and although no second mortgage was in existence when the form of \u201cagreement and lease\u201d was prepared, and, if all had gone well and all the apartments had been sold there would have been no need for such an encumbrance, there is, nevertheless, an express reference to it in the third recital which reads:\nAND WHEREAS the said described lands and premises are vested in the Company subject to a first mortgage in favour of the London Life Assurance Company for $310,000.00 with interest at 6\u00be% per annum, and\u2026subject to a second mortgage in favour of Alfonso Frisina securing the sum of $ with interest at 6\u00be%, which second mortgage shall be an open mortgage (it being the intention of all parties that the second mortgage shall if possible be paid off in full out of the proceeds of moneys paid by the Proprietary Lessees in respect of the said apartment suites and the said car parking spaces sold under the terms of this agreement).\nAll but three of the appellants had entered into the agreements and had taken possession of their suites before March 1, 1960, and of the other three, the appellant Swan, who had by that time also entered into possession, had acquired his title from a Mr. Airey, who was one of the original \u201cproprietary lessees\u201d and the other two appellants had acquired title through Frisina himself and had also signed the agreement before March 1, 1960. As to the respective positions of the appellants, I adopt the approach taken by Mr. Justice Laskin when he said, speaking on behalf of the Court of Appeal:\nFollowing the execution of the agreement of June 15, 1959, between Frisina and Benvenuto the former proceeded thereunder to arrange for sales of exclusive rights of occupancy of the various suites. In this connection it is unnecessary to distinguish the positions of those defendants who were original occupants and those who bought unsold suites held by Frisina and those who took an approved assignment from an original occupant. I shall take it that the defendants went into possession of their respective suites between September 14, 1959 and March 1st, 1960 (after entering into agreements with Benvenuto in the form of the specimen offer to purchase.)\nThe singular feature of the last-quoted recital is that at the time when the purchasers, or their predecessors in title signed the form of \u201cOffer to Purchase\u201d which was in each case accepted by Benvenuto, and of which the \u201cagreement and lease\u201d forms a part, Frisina had not yet deeded the property to Benvenuto and all concerned with the trans- action knew perfectly well that there was no second mortgage in existence and that the agreement under which Benvenuto was purchasing the building from Frisina made it clear that such a mortgage would only be given if the company was unable to pay the whole of the balance of the purchase price on closing.\nThe second and fourth clauses of the form of \u201cagreement and lease\u201d indicate the nature of the interest which was purchased by the appellants and which Benvenuto intended to convey. Clause 2 provides that:\nEach Proprietary Lessee shall be entitled to exclusively use and enjoy the apartment suite set opposite his or her name in the second column of said Schedule \u201cB\u201d so long as such Proprietary Lessee is the owner of all the shares set opposite his or her name in the eighth column of the said schedule \u201cB\u201d and on condition that such Proprietary Lessee abides by the terms and conditions of this agreement including the rules and regulations established by the Company as hereinafter provided.\nClause 4 of the agreement provides that:\nSo long as each Proprietary Lessee is the owner of the shares set opposite their respective names and is not in default under this agreement and fully complies with all rules and regulations established by the Company, such Proprietary Lessee shall have quiet possession of the apartment suite set opposite such Proprietary Lessee\u2019s name.\nClauses 10 and 11 of the same document contain some interesting provisions describing the company\u2019s powers in the event of default by the proprietary lessees. Clause 10 provides that if the default continues for more than one month\n\u2026then the Company may on one month\u2019s written notice to such Proprietary Lessee, if default continues, retake possession of the said apartment suite occupied by such Proprietary Lessee or his sub-tenant.\nAnd cl. 11 reads:\nAnd it is further covenanted, declared and agreed that in the event of default having occurred in the payment of any sum payable as aforesaid by any Proprietary Lessee to the Company, the Company may (notwithstanding any other right or power of the Company) distrain therefor upon the lands, tenements, hereditaments, and premises of the Proprietary Lessee and by distress warrant recover by way of rent reserved, as in the case of a demise, so much of such sum as shall remain in arrears and unpaid together with all costs attending such distress.\n(The italics are my own).\nThe 12th clause of this document provides that:\n12. This agreement shall replace any previous agreement or agreements entered into by any of the proprietary lessees with reference to the ownership, use and occupancy of the said apartment suites. Although the appellants had taken possession of their suites to the extent hereinbefore indicated in accordance with the terms of the agreement and lease, the document itself was not signed by any of them until the amount of the second mortgage had been determined and inserted in the third recital. The executed agreements are dated April 1, 1960, which is one day after the date of the deed to Benvenuto and the second mortgage to Frisina Enterprises and twenty-five days prior to the recording of the latter document.\nIt will be seen from all the above that the title to the premises and apartment building taken by Benvenuto under the agreement of sale of June 15, 1959, was subject to its agreement to sell the exclusive right of occupancy of the suites and in my opinion as each such suite was sold in accordance with this agreement, the interest of Benvenuto was diminished to the extent that it had conveyed to another the exclusive right of occupancy of its building. The only title which Benvenuto acquired by the deed of March 31, 1960, and which it had to dispose of on the same date when it gave the second mortgage to Frisina Enterprises Limited was, in my opinion, encumbered by reason of the sales which had already been made. In the course of his reasons for judgment, Mr. Justice Laskin makes something of the fact that the date upon which the form of agreement and lease was executed by the purchasers is not established by the evidence and may well have been after the second mortgage but, as I have indicated, he accepts the fact that the defendants went into possession of their respective suites before the second mortgage was given and in accordance with the offer to purchase which incorporated the form of agreement and lease. I think that the purchasers must be treated as having acquired whatever title they did acquire at the time when they took possession in accordance with the offer.\nIt will be apparent from the passages which I have quoted from the \u201cOffer to Purchase\u201d and the \u201cAgreement and Lease\u201d that what was conveyed by way of sale to the purchasers or \u201ctenant lessees\u201d was \u201cthe exclusive right of occupancy\u201d of a suite in the apartment building with quiet possession thereof for so long as each of them continued to be the owner of the shares alloted to them and was not in default under the agreement. There is elaborate provision in clauses 10 and 11 of the \u201cAgreement and Lease\u201d for eviction of any tenant lessee who is in default, including a covenant to the effect that in such event Benvenuto could distrain for recovery \u201cby way of rent reserved, as in the case of a demise\u201d, but there is no suggestion that any of the appellants was at any time in default and in my view until such default occurs, no \u201cproprietary lessee\u201d could be subject to eviction at the suit of Benvenuto. As I mentioned at the outset, the scheme employed for the financing and operation of the apartment building was in many respects based on the method devised for financing similar undertakings in the United States of America. This is made evident by reference to an article on Co-operative Apartment Housing in 61 Harvard Law Review at p. 1408 where it is said:\nA co-operative apartment house requires legal machinery which will give the individual tenant-owner something closely approximating \u201ctitle to a slice of air,\u201d while reserving to a collective entity the function of management and the power to assure proportional sharing of common expenses. Customarily, the promoter initiating the venture organizes a corporation, which acquires the land and building, normally subject to a mortgage. The prospective tenant-owner buys a block of shares corresponding to the value of the apartment to be occupied, receiving also a long-term or renewable lease. Rent is nominal, but the board of directors, elected by the tenant-shareholders, makes assessments for current expenses as well as for payments of interest and principal on the mortgage. The leases include provision for forfeiture at the option of the corporation on failure to pay assessments or on assignment without the consent of the board of directors.\nThe most essential difference between Frisina\u2019s scheme and the model upon which it appears to have been based, is that in the case of the present proprietary lessees the duration of the term of their occupancy was not fixed by specifying the number of years in the first instance or by reference to some collateral matter in itself certain or capable of being rendered certain. I agree with the submission of the respondent that by reason of this omission the interests taken by the appellants cannot be said to be leases in the strict sense of the word, but in a case such as the present one where the tenant lessees have taken possession for valuable consideration and where their tenancy is terminable only on default, I do not think that the failure to fix a term is to be construed as cutting down the extent of the interest conveyed to them under the provisions of the \u201cagreement and lease\u201d. In the case of The Trust and Loan Company of Canada v. Lawrason[2], the question to be determined was whether the Trust and Loan Company, by reason of the terms of the mortgage held by it, was to be treated as having redemised certain lands so as to create a landlord and tenant relationship whereby mortgage payments were to be considered as rent so that they would rank in priority to the claims of other creditors. The mortgage contained an \u201cattornment\u201d clause as follows:\n\u2026and the mortgagor does release to the Company all his claims upon the said lands and doth attorn to and become tenant at will of the Company subject to the said proviso,\u2026\nand there was also a provision for the mortgagor to distrain for arrears of interest after notice \u201cas in the case of the demise of said land\u201d and there was a covenant that until default of payment the mortgagor should have quiet possession. The Court of Appeal held that there was no fixed term and that the interest payments could not be treated as \u201cfixed rent\u201d under a tenancy. This Court was equally divided but the reasons for judgment affirming the Court of Appeal were written by Mr. Justice Strong who, in rejecting the argument that a tenancy at will was created by the attornment clause said:\nThis attornment clause appears to be so utterly inconsistent with the proviso, that the mortgagor should have quiet possession until default, that the one or the other of these clauses must be void for repugnancy. The mortgage deed, operating as a conveyance to the mortgagee of the whole fee, these provisions are in the nature of redemises to the mortgagor, and, therefore, must be construed beneficially to the mortgagor, and strictly against the mortgagee, who is in the position of a grantor as regards them. Then it being impossible to reconcile a tenancy at will, that is, a tenancy determinable at the will of the mortgagee, under which the latter can, at any time, take possession, with a provision, though in form but a mere personal covenant, that the mortgagor shall remain in quiet possession until default in payment; one or the other of these two clauses must necessarily give way, and upon the principle of construction just stated, it is clear that this must be the attornment clause being less beneficial to the mortgagor. It is no answer to this argument to say that the tenancy at will can subsist with the collateral personal convenant of the mortgagee not to take possession until default, for such a covenant would be enforced specifically by a court of equity, which would restrain the mortgagee from taking possession in violation of its terms, and thus there would arise a direct repugnancy between such a provision and a tenancy at will. Mr. Justice Strong went on to say, at p. 704:\nThen, the tenancy at will created by express words in the attornment clause being thus rejected we have only to deal with the provision that the mortgagor shall hold until default in payment of principal or interest at the times stipulated in the deed; if any tenancy is created it must be by that clause. Now, when I say that this clause is in the nature of a redemise, I do not mean to say that it creates a strict legal tenancy, that it confers upon the mortgagor a chattel interest amounting to a legal term, for it has been determined\u2014and upon long established principles of the law relating to leases and terms for years, it could not be otherwise held\u2014that the uncertainty in the duration of the term is fatal to such a construction, though, as I have before said, the covenant is one which a court of equity would undoubtedly enforce by restraining the mortgagee from ejecting the mortgagor before default.\nThe italics are my own.\nI think that at the very least the interest taken by the appellants in the present case was a demise secured by a covenant for quiet possession which a court of equity would undoubtedly enforce by restraining Benvenuto from ejecting any of them before default, and as the second mortgagee and its assignee Stein and the respondent who took his assignment without consideration, must all be taken to have had full knowledge of all the circumstances, including the covenant for quiet possession, I conclude that the respondent was bound by that covenant which is enforceable at equity by restraining him in the same manner as it would have been enforceable against Benvenuto.\nNot only must the respondent be taken to have had notice of the interests of the appellants, but the appellants were in actual occupation of their suites when the second mortgage was given, and in this regard reference may be had to the case of Barnhart v. Greenshields[3], decided in the Privy Council in 1853, which appears to be accepted as a modern authority. (See Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 14, p. 546 and vol. 34 at pp. 303 and 366, and Hanbury\u2019s Modern Equity, 8th ed., at p. 33.) In that case at p. 33 their Lordships accepted the statement of the rule governing such circumstances as made by Sir James Wigram in the case of Jones v. Smith[4], where he said:\nIf a person purchases an estate which he knows to be in the occupation of another than the vendor, he is bound by all the equities which the party in such occupation may have in the land\u2026for possession is prima facie evidence of seisin in fee. The exact factual situation in the present case appears to be a unique one and an extensive search of the authorities has not resulted in the discovery of any decided cases which characterize the exact interest acquired by the purchasers in terms of any of the categories heretofore accepted by the courts, but it appears that similar situations have arisen in the United States and have given rise to a comment in a work entitled The Influences of the Metropolis on the Concepts, Rules and Institutions Relating to Real Property, 1954; which is quoted in an article in 18 Stanford Law Review at p. 1328 as follows:\nIn some of these cases the question has arisen as to the extent and quality and legal character of the interest which is possessed by a purchaser of a co-operative apartment who is commonly called a \u2018tenant owner\u2019. The question remains largely unanswered. Some of the courts in discussing the question have expressly refused to give the interest a name, while others have used the designations ranging from \u2018tenancy\u2019 through \u2018equitable title\u2019. Apparently there has arisen in the field of real property a type of interest, peculiar to the co-operative apartment concept, which does not fit precisely in any of the ancient legal pigeonholes and which is not fully or adequately defined by existing legal terminology\nThe learned trial judge expressed the opinion that the appellants\n\u2026are licensees with a contractual right to exclusive possession of the apartments which they occupy so long as they retain the shares and comply with the terms of the agreement; and to sell such shares to a purchaser with the approval in writing of the Board of Directors of the Company and to assign to such purchaser all their rights under the Agreement with the Company, including the right to use and occupy the accommodation covered by the agreement.\nIn support of this proposition, reference was made to the case of Errington v. Errington[5], but I take the facts of the present case as being more favourable to the appellants than they were to the licensees in that case, and I think that what each of the appellants acquired by way of purchase was an equitable title to the exclusive right of occupancy of their respective suites and to quiet possession thereof so long as they remained the owner of the shares allotted to them in Benvenuto and were not in default under the terms of the agreement and lease.\nIt appears to me to be fitting at this point to make reference to the fact that in the course of purchasing their exclusive rights of occupancy, although the appellants ap- pear to have been dealing with three different entities, they were in fact dealing with only one controlling mind, namely that of Alfonso Frisina. Mr. Frisina incorporated Benvenuto and all its original five shares were held by or for him. This was the company to which he eventually conveyed the apartment house and with which the appellants entered into their agreements for exclusive occupancy of the suites. Frisina also incorporated Frisina Enterprises which was destined to become the second mortgagee and which ultimately assumed a number of administrative obligations in respect of the apartment building.\nMr. Justice Laskin said in the course of his reasons for judgment that this method of doing business was \u201ca permissible device\u201d and there can be no quarrel with this description. It was certainly a device and it was a permissible one having regard to the rule in Salomon v. Salomon & Co.[6] It is no part of my reasoning that the corporate veil should be pierced, and at this stage I am only referring to Frisina\u2019s method of operation in order to make it plain that at all times each of Frisina, Benvenuto and Frisina Enterprises knew exactly what the other was doing and no undertakings were made by one without the knowledge of the others. It is also significant to note that Frisina Enterprises, which was controlled by Frisina, was designated by him as the second mortgagee and it is to be appreciated that Mr. Stein, to whom Frisina Enterprises and Frisina assigned the second mortgage, took it with full knowledge of all the dealings between the Frisina companies and the appellants and that the present respondent is in this regard in the same position as Stein.\nAs I have indicated, I think that the question of priority is dependent upon the nature of the interest vested in Benvenuto at the time when the second mortgage was executed on March 31, 1960, and as I have said, I think it to be apparent that on that date when Frisina executed the deed to Benvenuto he had, in concert with that company and in accordance with the terms of the agreement of sale, already divested himself of the interest conveyed to the appellants and that this was well known and accepted by Frisina Enterprises and by the successive holders of the second mortgage. It follows, in my view, that the interests conveyed to the appellants were no longer Benvenuto\u2019s property to mortgage, and that the property mortgaged to Frisina Enterprises was then encumbered to the extent of the suites which it had sold.\nIt was argued on behalf of the respondent that the fact that the forms of \u201cagreement and lease\u201d which were not signed until April 1 or later and which each contained a recital specifying the amount of the second mortgage should, having regard to para. 12 thereof, be treated as replacing any previous agreement and as acknowledging the priority of the Frisina Enterprises\u2019 mortgage. There appears to me to be a number of answers to this contention. In the first place the \u201cagreement and lease\u201d which was finally signed contained all the same covenants as the document which was attached to the original offer to purchase, including the stipulation that the proprietary lessees were \u201cto be entitled to exclusively use and enjoy the apartment suite set opposite his or her name\u201d and the covenant for quiet possession of the suites and I think that these covenants must be treated as evidencing the recognition by all concerned that the mortgage referred to in the recital was a mortgage of property from which the interest of the proprietary lessees had already been carved out. In this regard it is to be remembered that the second mortgage was dated one day before the signed forms of \u201cagreement and lease\u201d and that it was not recorded until twenty-six days later.\nIn the second place, it is to be noted that the mortgagee was not a party to the \u201cagreement and lease\u201d and it is difficult to understand how its successor can invoke this document in aid of his claim to priority.\nI think it should be noted also that the only mention of the contemplated second mortgage in the original offer to purchase was in the following terms:\n\u2026the Purchasers covenant and agree that they will not in any manner whatsoever, alienate or encumber or cause to be alienated or encumbered, the said lands and premises, or any part thereof, prior to the date upon which the full proceeds of the said mortgage, including any holdback have been received by the Vendor Company and the second mortgage, referred to in the said form of agreement and lease attached hereto, has been registered.\n(The italics are my own.) It is difficult to give any clear meaning to this language without concluding that the vendor and the purchasers recognized that the interest which was conveyed was one which was capable of and could be \u201calienated or encumbered\u201d and that the purchasers were agreeing not to alienate or encumber their interests until the first mortgage had been fully advanced and the second mortgage had been registered. In my view this presupposes the conveyance to the purchasers of an equitable interest in the apartment building which vested in them prior to the execution and registration of the second mortgage. When this language is considered in conjunction with the various agreements which were entered into for the purpose of implementing the Frisina scheme for selling the apartment suites, it appears to me to confirm the view that Benvenuto had divested itself of the exclusive right to occupy the suites which it sold before it entered into the second mortgage.\nAlthough, no evidence was given at the trial by either the respondent or his partner, Mr. Samuel Stein, the letter written by their law firm to Benvenuto on March 29, 1962, clearly indicates that they recognized the prior interests of the appellants over the second mortgage which was then held by Stein. The first paragraph of that letter reads as follows:\nWe wish to advise you that we act for the second mortgagee on the above-mentioned property and inasmuch as the second mortgage is encumbered with collateral agreements covering the sale of the co-operative apartments, we feel that we must request copies of the yearly financial statements of the Hamilton Benvenuto Apartments Limited.\nThe italics are my own.\nIn my view the matter could not have been put more accurately and I conclude that everybody concerned recognized that the second mortgage was encumbered in the manner described in this letter.\nIn the course of his reasons for judgment, Mr. Justice Laskin gave expression to the opinion that even if the appellants had such an equitable interest, their title was nonetheless subject to Frisina\u2019s prior equitable interest as unpaid vendor. In this regard Mr. Justice Laskin said:\nEven if it be assumed that the defendants have an equitable interest by reason of their contractual licences to occupy certain apartment suites, Frisina had a prior equitable interest, an equitable charge as unpaid vendor, under the agreement for sale of June 15, 1959: see Cave v. Cave (1880), 15 Ch. D. 639. An equitable charge arises in favour of the unpaid vendor of an equitable estate which he has agreed to sell no less than in the case of an agreement of sale of a legal estate. Further, the defendants had notice of this prior interest (commonly, although not quite accurately, called a vendor\u2019s lien) which must, on this ground at least, rank ahead of their own. The present case does not compel a determination whether the contractual licences should be given the dignity of equitable interests in land or whether they should be regarded, at best, as mere equities which must be either personal as between the parties or might enjoy a farther reach but short of binding a subsequent purchaser for value and certainly short of binding a subsequent purchaser for value without notice. I refer in this connection to a recent consideration of these matters in National Provincial Bank Ltd. v. Ainsworth, [1965] A.C. 1175, [1965] 2 All E.R. 472; and see also Hanbury, Modern Equity, 8th ed., pp. 29, 428 ff.\nIt appears to me that the views so expressed on behalf of the Court of Appeal are fundamental to the reasoning upon which its decision was based and should therefore be considered in some detail.\nWith the greatest respect, I am unable to find direct authority in the cases which Mr. Justice Laskin has cited for the propositions which he has stated so clearly, but even proceeding on the assumption that an equitable charge in favour of an unpaid vendor may arise immediately upon his entering into an agreement for sale, it has, I think, been recognized in the past that there may be situations in which the conduct of the vendor or the terms under which the sale is made or other circumstances make it inequitable to allow the vendor to retain his lien. In this regard reference may be had to Austen v. Halsey[7], per Lord Eldon at p. 483; Rice v. Rice[8]; Mathers v. Short[9]; Kettlewell v. Watson[10]. In my opinion the principle to be followed is well expressed in the judgment of Spragge V.C. in Boulton v. Gillespie[11], where he said at p. 228:\nPrima facie, certainly the lien exists, and it lies upon the grantee to rebut it. It is the vendor\u2019s \u201cnatural equity,\u201d as it has been termed, to have a lien on his estate until he has been paid for it; but the vendee may show, I apprehend, that under the circumstances of the purchase it is not equitable that such a lien should be retained, and if he can shew that the retention of such lien would defeat or even materially interfere with the known object of the purchase, so as to clog it with difficulties which it is reasonable to conclude that the parties could not have intended that the purchase should be incumbered with; then I think he rebuts the vendor\u2019s prima facie equity and establishes a state of things under which the retention of a lien would be the reverse of equitable. It is sometimes put\u2014that the parties indicate an intention that the lien should not be preserved\u2014sometimes that the intention to retain a lien is negatived; but inasmuch as the right to a lien does not grow out of contract or intention, but out of the natural equity of the vendor, it seems to follow that wherever it can be shewn to be more equitable that the purchaser should have his land free from the lien, than that the vendor should retain it, no lien for unpaid purchase money can exist, for the equity against it outweighs the equity in favour of it\u2026\nUnder the agreement of June 15, 1959, Frisina agreed to accept as security a second mortgage if Benvenuto could not pay him the balance of the purchase price in cash on the closing date. As further protection it was stipulated in cl. 8 of the agreement that Frisina was to be entitled to retain possession of all unsold suites until he had been paid in full. In my opinion it is reasonable to conclude from this that Frisina never intended to preserve his equitable charge. He had obtained sufficient and adequate security under the agreement. In my view, under the special circumstances of this case the equities against the recognition of an outstanding vendor\u2019s lien outweigh those in favour of it. As I have indicated, I have formed the opinion that the interest conveyed to the appellants takes priority over that of the second mortgagee and I should point out that I do not consider that the second mortgage can be treated as the successor or reincarnation of Frisina\u2019s vendor\u2019s lien. It is a security which is entirely independent of the lien and which was from the very outset contemplated as being accepted by Frisina as full payment and therefore as a substitution for any unpaid vendor\u2019s lien which might otherwise have been outstanding. This does not mean that the second mortgagee fell heir to the rights of an unpaid vendor. There was nothing in the nature of an assignment of a vendor\u2019s lien and indeed no encumbrance created by the purchaser could possibly have such an effect.\nIn the course of these reasons I have not dealt with the facts in such detail as did the judges of the Courts below, but I can perhaps summarize my view by saying that I agree with the factual analysis to be found in the judgment of the learned trial judge and that I consider the title of the appellants to have been controlled by the provisions of the agreement of sale of June 15, 1959, and the \u201coffer to purchase\u201d and \u201cagreement and lease\u201d which were annexed thereto. Mr. Justice Laskin has referred to an agreement of April 19, 1960, between Frisina and Frisina Enterprises of the one part and Benvenuto of the other as \u201can amended agreement\u201d, but after careful consideration of the provi- sions of that document, I do not consider that it has any material effect on the problem with which we are here concerned.\nHaving regard to all the above, it will be seen that I do not consider that the judgment nisi rendered in favour of the respondent against Hamilton Benvenuto Apartments Limited for foreclosure of the second mortgage clothes him with any right to disturb the appellants in the quiet enjoyment of the apartment suites acquired by them pursuant to the documents hereinbefore discussed.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nThe appellants will have their costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.\nMARTLAND J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts of this case are fully outlined in the reasons for judgment of Laskin J.A., who delivered the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal[12], which are, in part, repeated in these reasons.\nOn June 15, 1959, Alfonso Frisina (hereinafter referred to as \u201cFrisina\u201d) entered into an agreement with Hamilton Benvenuto Apartments Limited (hereinafter referred to as \u201cBenvenuto\u201d) for the sale to Benvenuto of a parcel of land in the City of Hamilton on which he had commenced the construction of a 48-suite apartment building. Benvenuto had recently been incorporated by Frisina, and, at that time, was controlled by him. The price was $844,500 less the assumption of a first mortgage on the land in favour of The London Life Insurance Company, for $310,000 principal amount, leaving a balance of $534,500 payable by Benvenuto to Frisina on closing. The closing date was October 1, 1959, subject to extension by the vendor to such time as 51 per cent of the issued shares of Benvenuto had been sold.\nClauses 5, 6 and 7 of this agreement provided as follows:\n5. The Company hereby irrevocably directs that the full proceeds of the said mortgage made by The London Life Insurance Company and being Instrument No. 66502 H.L. (which mortgage is being assumed by the Company as heretofore set out), be paid to the vendor by The London Life Insurance Company, as and when advances made thereon are approved by The London Life Insurance Company\u2019s inspector, not- withstanding any direction or stipulation of the Company to the contrary, which may have been or may hereafter be made, and the Company covenants and agrees that it will not in any manner whatsoever alienate or encumber or cause to be alienated or encumbered, the said lands and premises, or any part thereof, prior to the date upon which the full proceeds of the said mortgage, including any holdback, have been received by the vendor, and the second mortgage (if any) hereinafter referred to has been registered. If for any reason whatsoever any monies are paid by The London Life Insurance Company to the Company in respect to the said mortgage Instrument No. 66502 H.L. such monies shall immediately be paid by the Company to the vendor.\n6. If on the closing of the transaction herein the Company is unable to pay to the vendor the whole of the balance due on closing, namely Five Hundred and Thirty-Four Thousand and Five Hundred Dollars ($534,500.00) as above set out, then on account of such deficiency and to the extent of such deficiency the vendor agrees to take back a second mortgage on the said lands and premises and the said forty-eight suite apartment building (subject only to the said first mortgage to The London Life Insurance Company, being Instrument No. 66502 H.L. bearing interest at the rate of 6\u00be% per annum and for a term of ten (10) years, maturing at the same time as the said first mortgage, repayable at Seven Dollars and Fifty-eight Cents ($7.58) per month per One Thousand Dollars.\n7. The Company agrees to sell the exclusive right of occupancy of the suites in the said forty-eight suite apartment building at the prices shown in and in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the form of Offer to Purchase attached hereto as Appendix A.\n(The emphasis is my own.)\nThe agreement contemplated that Benvenuto would sell exclusive rights of occupancy of the suites to persons who would be required to become shareholders of that company and the proceeds realized from the sale of shares and from such rights of occupancy were to be applied to the balance owing to Frisina and to the second mortgage which Frisina or his nominee would take back to the extent of any deficiency in payment of the closing balance.\nThe specimen Offer to Purchase, referred to in cl. 7, and a following memorandum of agreement, contained a schedule of share allotments and prices assigned to each suite and to parking spaces in the apartment building, and also contained blank columns envisaging proportionate assumptions of first and second mortgage liabilities by persons who did not pay the full cash price for their shares and exclusive right of occupancy of suites. These specimen documents were the basis on which Benvenuto would sell its shares and accompanying rights of occupancy of the various suites.\nIt is clear from the facts that if all the apartment suites were disposed of at the prescribed prices, Benvenuto would be able to pay off Frisina as well as the first mortgagee, and have a balance on hand. As protection, however, to Frisina the agreement of June 15, 1959, provided that until this result was achieved Frisina would retain possession of all unsold suites on payment of the prescribed monthly operating charge assigned to each such suite and would be entitled to sell them under an obligation of Benvenuto to enter into an agreement with the purchasers whereby the sums paid for the appropriate stock subscription would be paid to Frisina to reduce Benvenuto\u2019s debt to him. Frisina also retained the right to rent any unsold suites on such terms as he desired. Should the deal with Benvenuto be closed before sale of all the suites, the shares in Benvenuto referable to each unsold suite were to be issued to Frisina who would be liable to pay the monthly mortgage encumbrance charge on each such suite in addition to the monthly operating charge, until the suite was sold. Frisina could also require Benvenuto to sell the suites at a price below that prescribed but in such case the sale price of the apartment building would be correspondingly reduced.\nThe Offer to Purchase had annexed to it a memorandum of agreement with schedules describing the apartment building land and showing the prices of the various suites (ranging from $13,000 to $22,500) and the number of shares in Benvenuto pertaining to each suite at a cost of $1 per share. There were blank columns in this schedule headed: (1) Share of First Mortgage Assumed; (2) Share of Second Mortgage Assumed (if any); (3) No. of Fully Paid Shares Issued; (4) Portion of Monthly Payment Relating to Total Mortgage Encumbrance Assumed; (5) Portion of Monthly Payment Relating to All Other Company and Apartment Expenses (Estimated); and (6) Total Monthly Payments Presently Estimated. The parties to this memorandum of agreement were to be Benvenuto and the shareholder-occupants of all the suites. It was apparently contemplated that all would join in the one memorandum of agreement but when this document came to be executed in April, 1960, separate documents in the same general terms were prepared for each shareholder-occupant.\nIt was a term of the Offer to Purchase that the purchasers of the suites (i.e., of the exclusive right of occupancy thereof) would \u201cexecute an agreement and lease in the form attached to this Offer before taking possession of the said apartment suite and (if applicable) the parking space hereinafter referred to.\u201d In fact, possession was given in pursuance of the execution of the Offer to Purchase and payment of the sum prescribed as a condition of such possession. Execution of the contemplated \u201cagreement and lease\u201d came later.\nThe following terms of the Offer to Purchase must be noted. The total price payable thereunder was for the exclusive right of occupancy of a designated suite and for the number of shares corresponding to the total price at $1 per share. Any balance of the purchase price, beyond that portion stipulated as a condition of possession, was payable \u201cby assuming part of the total mortgage encumbrance against the said apartment building premises to the extent of the said amount\u2026and paying for such as hereinafter set out.\u201d The reference later was to a sum monthly, called the monthly mortgage encumbrance charge, calculated on the basis of $7.58 per month per thousand dollars of mortgage encumbrance assumed by the purchaser. In addition, the purchaser undertook to pay a monthly operating charge in a specified sum \u201cor such monthly payment as may be fixed from time to time by the directors of (Benvenuto).\u201d\nPortions of two other clauses of the Offer to Purchase are relevant:\n\u2026the Purchasers covenant and agree that they will not in any manner whatsoever alienate or encumber or cause to be alienated or encumbered the said lands and premises, or any part thereof, prior to the date upon which the full proceeds of the (first) mortgage, including any holdback, have been received by (Benvenuto) and the second mortgage, referred to in the said form of agreement and lease attached hereto, has been registered.\nThe Purchasers acknowledge that they have been advised that (Benvenuto) has agreed to purchase from Alfonso Frisina the said lands and premises\u2026together with the complete 48 Suite Apartment Building erected thereon at the price of $844,500.00. And the Purchasers agree with the Vendor that all monies payable by the Purchasers under this agreement may be disbursed by (Benvenuto) at its discretion and direction to the said Alfonso Frisina in payment of the cost of construction of the said 48 Suite Apartment Building being erected on the said lands and premises, such monies to be credited on account of the purchase price of the said lands and buildings payable by (Benvenuto).\nThe \u201cagreement and lease\u201d form attached to the Offer to Purchase contains, inter alia, a recital and a number of terms which are relevant. The recital states that the apartment property is vested in Benvenuto subject to the first mortgage already mentioned in these reasons and subject to a second mortgage in an unstated sum in favour of Frisina, \u201cit being the intention of all parties that the second mortgage shall if possible be paid off in full out of the proceeds of moneys paid by the proprietary lessees in respect of the said apartment suites and said car parking spaces sold under the terms of this agreement.\u201d The following numbered clauses of the \u201cagreement and lease\u201d form are relevant:\n1. The Company agrees to issue and allot to each of the said Proprietary Lessees the number of shares set opposite each respective owner\u2019s name in the eighth column of said Schedule \u201cB\u201d as fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Company, and the Company does acknowledge receipt from each Proprietary Lessee of the amount set opposite their respective names in the fifth column of said Schedule \u201cB\u201d. The Company doth further acknowledge that it has not issued and allotted any shares except as set out in the eighth column of said Schedule \u201cB\u201d, and the five (5) shares issued to the applicants for incorporation of the Company. The Company further agrees that no additional shares will be issued except to the respective Proprietary Lessee for the number of shares set opposite each respective Proprietary Lessee\u2019s name in the third column of said Schedule \u201cB\u201d less the number of shares set opposite such Proprietary Lessee\u2019s name in the eighth column of said Schedule \u201cB\u201d, and that no additional shares shall be issued until payment therefor is made to the Company.\n2. Each Proprietary Lessee shall be entitled to exclusively use and enjoy the apartment suite set opposite his or her name in the second column of said Schedule \u201cB\u201d so long as such Proprietary Lessee is the owner of all the shares set opposite his or her name in the eighth column of the said Schedule \u201cB\u201d and on condition that such Proprietary Lessee abides by the terms and conditions of this agreement including the rules and regulations established by the Company as hereinafter provided.\n4. So long as each Proprietary Lessee is the owner of the shares set opposite their respective names and is not in default under this agreement and fully complies with all rules and regulations established by the Company, such Proprietary Lessee shall have quiet possession of the apartment suite set opposite such Proprietary Lessee\u2019s name.\n5. Each Proprietary Lessee agrees to pay to the Company on the first day of each and every month the sum set opposite such Proprietary Lessee\u2019s name in the eleventh column of said Schedule \u201cB\u201d or an amount greater or less than such sum as may be determined by the Directors of the Company expressed in formal resolution of such Directors from time to time, it being intended that the said monthly payments made by all the Proprietary Lessees shall be sufficient to pay and discharge the principal and interest payments on the aforesaid mortgage(s) and all taxes, insurance premiums, janitor\u2019s services, heat, repairs and all other expenses incidental to the operation of the lands and apartment building and any incidental expenses in operating the Company\u2026\n7. Each Proprietary Lessee covenants not to sell, assign, or pledge such Proprietary Lessee\u2019s shares of stock set opposite his or her name in said Schedule \u201cB\u201d without selling all such shares to a proposed purchaser nor will such Proprietary Lessee sell his or her shares without the approval to such sale or dealing being first given in writing by the Board of Direc- tors of the Company. In the event that the Company approves the assignment of any Proprietary Lessee\u2019s shares in the Company to any purchaser, the selling Proprietary Lessee shall thereafter cease to be liable for any further payments under this agreement,\u2026\nClause 10 deals with the default of a proprietary lessee in any payments required to be made under the agreement, with breach of any terms and conditions thereof and with breach of any rules and regulations which the Board of Directors of Benvenuto are authorized to make; and provides in certain circumstances that Benvenuto may take possession of the particular suite and sell it. Clause 11 provides for distress by Benvenuto in case of default in any required payments.\n12. This agreement shall replace any previous agreement or agreements entered into by any of the Proprietary Lessees with reference to the ownership, use and occupancy of the said apartment suites.\nAfter a selling effort in the late summer and fall of 1959 to fill the apartment building with shareholder-occupants, the various parties moved through solicitors to complete both the corporate and real estate aspects of the interrelated deals. It was not until closing was near that the exact amount of the contemplated second mortgage was determined. Frisina\u2019s deed to Benvenuto was dated and executed on March 31, 1960, but was not registered until April 22, 1960. The second mortgage back was also dated March 31, 1960. It recites the amount secured as being $258,391.85 and was in favour of Frisina Enterprises (Hamilton) Limited, Frisina\u2019s nominee. When it was actually executed is not clear, but the mortmain affidavit was not sworn until April 19, 1960, and the document itself was not registered until April 26, 1960. It was contended that it was delivered in escrow, awaiting execution on April 19, 1960, of a supplementary agreement between Frisina, his nominated company, which became the second mortgagee, and Benvenuto (which by that time was in the hands of a new Board of Directors consisting of the shareholder-occupants), amending the original agreement of June 15, 1959. The evidence shows that a draft of the amending agreement of April 19, 1960, had been prepared as of March 29, 1960, and that by this date the amount of the second mortgage had been determined.\nThis amending agreement of April 19, 1960, was made in the light of a statement of adjustments calculated as of April 1, 1960, and in the light of the sequential agreements between Benvenuto and its shareholder-occupants who took over direction of Benvenuto on April 5, 1960. These agreements, although dated April 1, 1960, and executed by Benvenuto on that date or between that date and April 4, 1960, were executed by the shareholder-occupants at various dates following April 4, 1960. When these agreements were mailed out for execution they included the ascertained sum of $258,391.85 as the amount of the second mortgage recited therein.\nThese individual agreements had annexed to them as a schedule a list of the shareholder\u2011occupants of each suite (including those retained by Frisina as unsold) and an attribution in respect of each of the portions of the first and second mortgages assumed by the respective shareholder-occupants, representing the unpaid balances of the total purchase prices of the respective exclusive rights of occupancy; and the schedule also showed the assigned amounts of the monthly maintenance payments.\nThe agreements of April 1, 1960, were in substance in the terms indicated in the specimen form attached to the Offers to Purchase executed earlier by the shareholder-occupants. In particular, they retained the provision that \u201cthis agreement shall replace any previous agreement or agreements entered into by any of the proprietary lessees with reference to the ownership, use and occupancy of the said apartment suites.\u201d\nEach such agreement contained the following recital:\nAND WHEREAS the said lands and premises are vested in the Company subject to a first mortgage in favour of The London Life Insurance Company for $310,000.00 with interest at 6\u00be% per annum (collaterally secured by a chattel mortgage to The London Life Insurance Company on all the chattels owned by the Company and contained in the said Apartment Building) and subject to a second mortgage in favour of Alfonso Frisina (or in favour of such mortgagee as he may designate) securing the sum of $258,391.85 with interest at 6\u00be%, which second mortgage shall be an open mortgage (it being the intention of all parties that the second mortgage shall if possible be paid off in full out of the proceeds of moneys paid by the Proprietary Lessees in respect of the said apartment suites and said car parking spaces sold under the terms of this agreement).\nWhat was added to the individual agreements of April 1, 1960, beyond the terms specified in the specimen form already referred to, were clauses indicating the collective adherence of the shareholder-occupants to their provisions and to the schedule distributing shares in Benvenuto, the exclusive rights of occupancy attendant thereon and the financial burden of participation in the venture. They also fixed April 1, 1960, as the date on which the prescribed monthly payments assigned to each shareholder-occupant would begin.\nThe amending agreement of April 19, 1960, provided for the disbursement by Benvenuto of certain money, owing to it by certain listed shareholders, to pay off specified tax and public utility charges and some other debts so as to permit closing on the basis of adjustments as of April 1, 1960. Upon the money being paid over Frisina was to deliver to Benvenuto the resignations of all the first directors, save his own, together with the resignations of the officers of Benvenuto. The amending agreement also confirmed Frisina\u2019s right to sell his rights of occupancy and the shares pertaining thereto to persons approved by Benvenuto\u2019s board of directors and to rent suites to which he held such rights to persons similarly approved, but such approval was not to be unreasonably withheld. Frisina could require the issue to him of additional shares in Benvenuto at $1 per share or through a reduction in the amount of the second mortgage at that rate per share. In no case, however, could Frisina vote more than 49 per cent of issued stock regardless of his holding more; and he was required at Benvenuto\u2019s request to transfer any excess over 49 per cent to a trustee (being either the president or an officer of Benvenuto) to vote them in the best interests of all shareholders.\nStein purchased the second mortgage under an assignment dated June 10, 1961, and registered on July 12, 1961. The mortgage statement supplied in connection with the purchase showed a balance owing on the second mortgage of $228,271.07, rounded off, both in the assignment and in an acknowledgment by Benvenuto to Stein, at $228,273.00. It is admitted that at the time he took, Stein had notice of the two mortgages and had been previously provided with blank and unexecuted forms of (1) the Offer to Purchase to Benvenuto and (2) the memorandum of agreement dated as of April 1, 1960; and had also received a copy of the amending agreement of April 19, 1960. The abstract of title of the apartment property did not show any registered assertion of an interest by any of the share- holder-occupants before Stein took. The defendant Walton purported to register her proprietary lease on July 2, 1964, but this was after the crystallization of the issues between the parties.\nIt appears that the second mortgage was in good standing to the time when Frisina disposed of his shares pertaining to unsold suites to Henry Stenekes Holdings Limited under an agreement dated April 1, 1963. Benvenuto was also a party thereto, giving its consent to the assignment of the shares and the accompanying rights of occupancy.\nThe plaintiff herein became holder of the second mortgage under an assignment dated May 28, 1963, at which time the amount owing thereon was $216,271.49. Since he did not take for value he stood in no better position than Stein. The claim in the foreclosure action was $219,290.18 and, with interest and costs, the redemption sum as of October 1, 1964, was $226,753.23.\nA default foreclosure judgment was obtained by the respondent against Benvenuto on April 1, 1964. The final order of foreclosure was signed on October 2, 1964.\nThe appellants in occupation of all but three of the suites in issue in these proceedings, and H. Airey, who subsequently assigned his interest to the appellant, Swan, took possession of their respective suites between August, 1959, and March 1, 1960, after signing the written Offers to Purchase, in the specimen form, dated between July 24 and December 30, 1959. Two of the appellants, who purchased rights of occupancy from Frisina, took possession on May 1 and June 25, 1960, respectively.\nThe present proceedings were brought by the respondent claiming possession of the apartment building. The appellants, occupants of suites in the building, and shareholders of Benvenuto, claim the right to retain possession of their suites, so long as they make the payments stipulated in their agreements with Benvenuto.\nAt trial, it was held that they were licensees, with a contractual right to exclusive possession which they could maintain as against the respondent. The respondent\u2019s appeal was allowed by unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal. From that judgment the present appeal is brought.\nIn the Court of Appeal, it was apparently conceded by the appellants that their interests in the land did not have the character of either a leasehold or a freehold estate. While this concession was not made in this Court, the argument of the appellants was, essentially, first, that they had an \u201cequity\u201d which should have priority over the interest of Frisina, and accordingly over his nominee company, the second mortgagee, and over the respondent, who had acquired the second mortgage. Secondly, it was also contended that there was an equitable estoppel which precluded Frisina, and his successtors, from asserting priority for the second mortgage as against the appellants.\nAs to the second of these arguments, I adopt what was said by Laskin J.A. in the Court of Appeal, as follows:\nBefore turning to examine the facts out of which the issues between the parties arise, it should be noted that the defendants did not and do not rely on any oral representations of Frisina to found their claim of estoppel; they rely only on such representations as are contained in written documents, to some of which the defendants became parties through agreements with Benvenuto. No attack was made on the validity of those agreements, and it is unreal to talk of estoppel so far as they are concerned. The defendants are entitled to whatever rights those agreements confer. But since the rights are against Benvenuto, the estoppel argument appears to amount to a contention that Frisina used Benvenuto as an instrument. In assessing this contention, it is a relevant consideration that those defendants who became original shareholders of Benvenuto when the complex transaction involved herein was carried through by Frisina, were represented by counsel. All interested parties had legal advice, and all documents were scrutinised and all transactions concluded with the participation of lawyers.\n\u2026\nIt remains to deal with the defendants\u2019 submission of estoppel which was forcibly urged against the plaintiff\u2019s claim. The contention is that the alleged estoppel was operable against Frisina and that it was equally operable against Stein (and hence against the plaintiff) who had notice of the representations which are asserted as the basis for the defence of estoppel. Whether Stein and the plaintiff would be estopped in this case if this defence was established against Frisina does not arise for determination because, in my opinion, estoppel cannot be maintained against Frisina.\nI agree that estoppel may arise in respect of words or conduct that induce the representee to become party to a contract with another, and, equally, it may arise by reason of subsequent words or conduct that would preclude reliance on a previously concluded contract. But, in either case, there must be a representation from which the representor seeks to recede after it induced a detrimental change of position. I do not find in the present case any representation by Frisina to the defendants with reference to the subordination of his equitable charge or of the second mortgage to their rights of occupancy or with respect to the fragmentation of the amount owing on the second mortgage according to their outstanding liabilities to Benvenuto. Nor do I find any attempt to recede from such representations as Frisina may have made in any documents to which he was a party. Certainly, estoppel cannot be grounded on representations which are themselves terms of a bargain between the alleged representor and the alleged representees. The question in such case becomes one of construction and application of the bargain. As has already been stated, the representations relied on here are not oral but are those reflected in the written transactions. Two of them only need be mentioned. The agreement of June 15, 1959 preceded any relationships involving the defendants; its terms were not addressed to them. The offers to purchase which the defendants executed represented their bargain with Benvenuto. The balance of benefit and detriment under that bargain does not give rise to any issue of estoppel outside of it. The defendants got what they bargained for from Benvenuto; nothing was promised to them by Frisina personally. They cannot lay at his door any mistaken belief they may have had that the payments they were required to make under their agreements with Benvenuto would protect them against persons with rights in the property superior to those of Benvenuto. Their counsel admitted on appeal that there were no misrepresentations; and I note again that they had solicitors to guide them. In short, the defendants knew what was afoot and were not misled.\nIn my opinion the first and main submission of the appellants should also fail, for the following reasons:\nWhatever rights the appellants acquired in relation to the lands in question were derived and could only be derived by virtue of their contracts with Benvenuto. In making those contracts, Benvenuto was contracting on its own behalf, as principal, and not as agent for Frisina. There were no representations made by Frisina on the basis of which any such agency could be established.\nThat being so, it is necessary to determine what rights Benvenuto had in relation to those lands, for it could not confer upon the appellants any rights greater than those which it, itself, had. Benvenuto\u2019s rights in respect of the lands were spelled out in its contract with Frisina, dated June 15, 1959. That was an agreement for the sale of the lands by Frisina to Benvenuto at a price of $844,500. Benvenuto, by virtue of that contract, obtained the right to acquire Frisina\u2019s equitable interest (the lands being subject to a legal mortgage), but subject to the terms of the agreement.\nThe lands were subject to a first mortgage in favour of The London Life Insurance Company, and Benvenuto\u2019s equitable interest in the lands, as purchaser under an agreement for sale, was, of course, subject to that. But in addition, Benvenuto had agreed, for consideration, that if it was unable to pay the whole of the balance of the purchase price of $534,500 on the closing date, Frisina should have a second mortgage for the unpaid amount, \u201csubject only to the said first mortgage to The London Life Insurance Company.\u201d Benvenuto\u2019s equitable interest in the lands was also subject to that, and Frisina, by virtue of the agreement to give a mortgage, retained an equitable charge on the lands, which would continue until he had been paid the full balance of the purchase price which Benvenuto had agreed to pay (Rooker v. Hoofstetter, (1895), 26 S.C.R. 41).\nThis being so, Benvenuto could not, itself, create any equitable interests in the lands which would not be subject to Frisina\u2019s interest, unless and until it had paid up the balance due. This situation is emphasized in the agreement in two respects. First is Benvenuto\u2019s covenant not to alienate or encumber, or cause to be alienated or encumbered, the lands in any manner whatsoever until the second mortgage had been registered. Second was the provision that Benvenuto would sell the exclusive right of occupancy of the suites in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Offer to Purchase. That form provided, as a part of the agreement with Benvenuto, that the parties to the agreement would not alienate or encumber, or cause to be alienated or encumbered, the lands, until the second mortgage had been registered. It also provided that the persons acquiring the occupancy of suites from Benvenuto would execute the agreement attached to the Offer to Purchase, before taking possession of their suites. The attached agreement provided that it should replace any previous agreement with reference to the ownership, use and occupancy of the suites. It contained a specific recital that the lands on which the apartment building had been erected were subject, in addition to the first mortgage, to a second mortgage in favour of Frisina.\nThe agreement of June 15, 1959, therefore contemplated that, in entering into agreements for the occupancy of suites, Benvenuto could only do so on the basis of an agreement with the occupants which specifically recognized the existence of a second mortgage on the whole of the lands and premises. Benvenuto, in dealing with the appellants, carried out this obligation. The fact that most of the appellants took possession of their suites before signing the final agreements with Benvenuto does not alter the position, in view of the fact that each suite occupant did sign such an agreement, which, by its terms, replaced all prior agreements, and which specifically acknowledged the amount of the second mortgage against the whole of the lands and premises.\nThe position is, therefore, that Benvenuto could not grant any right or interest in the lands which was not subject to the second mortgage, and that, in fact, it never purported to do so.\nThe agreement of Benvenuto to give a second mortgage to secure the balance of the purchase price was performed, and the second mortgage was executed and registered. For the above reasons it is my opinion that the second mortgagee had equitable rights prior to any rights of the appellants, which mortgagee\u2019s rights, in due course, were assigned to the respondent.\nFor these reasons, as well as those given by Laskin J.A. in the Court of Appeal, with which I agree, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed and trial judgment restored, with costs, MARTLAND J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Minden, Dales & Tick, Hamilton.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Robins & Robins, Toronto.\n[1] [1968] 1 O.R. 105, 65 D.L.R.

The appellant counterclaimed for rectification of the lease. The lease stipulated an annual rent of $12,000 \u201ctogether with additional rent in a sum equal to the amount (if any) by which one (1%) per cent of the annual gross sales of the business carried on by the lessee\u2026 exceeds the said minimum annual rental\u2026\u201d. The expression \u201cgross sales\u201d is further defined as meaning the appellant\u2019s gross revenues less certain deductions, including \u201c\u2026 any amount paid by the lessee hereunder for taxes and insurance premiums\u201d. The appellant alleged that the true agreement between the parties was that taxes and insurance premiums were to be deducted from one per cent of gross sales rather than from gross sales. The trial judge dismissed the claim for rectification. The Court of Appeal held that the appellant had failed to adduce evidence of a prior concluded agreement in the terms alleged by it and that the trial judge had reached the right conclusion.

He signed a waiver of his right of appeal. From 1964 to 1967, he made several applications to have the preventive detention order set aside. Finally in 1967, he made the present application for a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid to quash the warrant of committal. The writ was refused by Wilson C.J. The main ground upon which the appellant relied was that he had not been given seven clear days\u2019 notice of the application under s. 661(1) of the Criminal Code and that consequently, the magistrate had been without jurisdiction to enter upon the hearing.\nAt the hearing before the magistrate, the appellant admitted service of a written notice, which was filed as an exhibit, but no reference was made to the date of the service. That exhibit was lost. The appellant filed a lengthy affidavit, largely argumentative, in which he draws the conclusion that the notice could not have been served seven clear days before the hearing. His affidavit did not state where or when the notice was served upon him. In their affidavits, the magistrate and the Crown prosecutor stated that at the hearing it was proved to the magistrate\u2019s satisfaction that the appellant received a notice of seven clear days. The affidavit of the constable who served the notice also stated that he believed he complied with the legal requirements. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, affirmed the refusal of the application for the writ. The appellant appealed to this Court and subse- quently obtained leave to appeal from the refusal of the relief sought in the proceedings by way of certiorari.\nHeld (Cartwright C.J. and Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The circumstances of this case bring it within the application of s. 682(b) of the Criminal Code which prevents the removal of the magistrate\u2019s order by certiorari. If it can be said that the words \u201cthe merits were tried\u201d in s. 682(b) can only be applicable where the Court had jurisdiction, the section ceases to have any real meaning. The writ of certiorari is primarily concerned with the matter of jurisdiction of an inferior Court. The section was intended to apply, and by its terms does apply in a situation where, in the absence of the section, the jurisdiction of the Court might have been questioned on certiorari. The intention of the section is to preclude the coexistence of two remedies. By its terms it applies, in any case falling within its provisions, to any attempt to remove a conviction or order by certiorari. This view of the effect of s. 682 does not run counter to the judgment of this Court in Smith v. R., [1959] S.C.R. 638.\nIt is unnecessary to express any view as to whether, in the light of the provisions of s. 691 of the Criminal Code, this Court has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from a refusal by the Courts to grant certiorari.\nThere is no requirement that the warrant of committal recite that the accused had been given seven clear days\u2019 notice of the application.\nEven if s. 682(b) were not to be considered as constituting a bar to proceedings by way of certiorari, the appeal fails on the merits. In the light of the circumstances in this case, it was incumbent upon the appellant, when he applied for certiorari on the ground that he had not received adequate notice, to establish that fact by clear and positive evidence. He has not discharged that onus.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Hall and Spence JJ., dissenting: Seven clear days\u2019 notice not having been given to the appellant as required by s. 662(1)(b) of the Code, the magistrate was without jurisdiction ab initio and the warrant of committal must fall. In these proceedings the Court can inquire whether the requisite notice was given. Section 682(b) of the Code does not deprive the Courts of jurisdiction to grant certiorari in this case. The great weight of authority supports the view that s. 682 is not a bar to the issue of certiorari where the proceedings sought to be questioned are invalid ab initio. Therefore, the Courts below were entitled to examine the record to determine whether the magistrate was without jurisdiction ab initio and this Court has the same right and duty.\nIf the matter were res integra the same view would prevail. The case did not fall within the literal wording of s. 682 as s. 661 does not contemplate the making of any plea. Furthermore, it cannot be said that \u201cmerits were tried\u201d when in fact and in law the magistrate never acquired jurisdiction to enter upon the hearing. If the requisite notice was not given then the proceedings before the magistrate were not a trial but a nullity.\nThe warrant of committal was defective on its face in that it shows that the order was made by an inferior Court and does not show that the notice imperatively required by s. 662(1)(b) as a condition precedent to the magistrate having power to hear the application was given and that a copy thereof was filed as required. When, as in the case at bar it is alleged that a condition precedent to the inferior Court acquiring jurisdiction to enter on the hearing was not fulfilled and the warrant is silent, s. 61 of the Supreme Court Act provides an expeditious method of ascertaining whether or not the allegation is well founded.\nThe finding of the majority in the Court of Appeal that the requisite notice was in fact given to the appellant seven clear days before the hearing cannot be sustained. It cannot be said that an onus rests upon the appellant to establish that which ought to be a matter of record.\nPer Hall J., dissenting: The view that s. 682 of the Code denies the right to remove the order requires holding that a person convicted in a proceeding which is in law a nullity is without recourse by certiorari when that person might have appealed. The section does not achieve that result. When Parliament said \u201cwhere the defendant appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried\u201d, it meant a lawful trial or hearing and not a proceeding which was in law a nullity. The language used in s. 682 is quite explicit, but it is no broader or more explicit than that found in many statutes which contain privative clauses of which the Labour Relations Act of Ontario is an example. There is no consistency in holding that s. 682 is an absolute bar to certiorari in a case involving the liberty of the person when equally explicit enactments deny certiorari in Labour Relations legislation are not so regarded. Where there is no jurisdiction there cannot be a trial on the merits within the meaning of s. 682.\nPer Pigeon J., dissenting: Proceedings leading to a sentence of preventive detention constitute a separate issue distinct from the charge following which they are instituted. Section 682(b) of the Code cannot be applied to a sentence of preventive detention because the procedure on an application for such a sentence does not provide for a plea by the accused. The appellant is in the same situation as in Smith v. The Queen, [1959] S.C.R. 638, he has not pleaded. The appellant is therefore entitled to certiorari.\nThe record shows that it was not proved before the magistrate that seven clear days\u2019 notice was given as required imperatively by s. 662 of the Criminal Code. Even if the appellant could validly admit having received the notice, such an admission is not sufficient in a criminal case. It could not be presumed that the lost exhibit showed that the required interval of seven clear days had been observed. The affidavits did not prove that this did appear on the document.\nThe magistrate proceeded without adequate proof of a notice served in accordance with the requirements of the law and this defect deprived him of his jurisdiction. Section 683(1) of the Code forbids proceeding without notice. This is a condition precedent to jurisdiction.\nAPPEAL from a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the refusal by Wilson C.J. of an application for a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid to quash a sentence of preventive detention. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright C.J. and Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting.\nC.R. Kennedy, for the appellant.\nW.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Spence J. was delivered by THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] pronounced on June 3, 1968, dismissing the appellant\u2019s appeal from the judgment of Wilson C.J. pronounced on August 7, 1967, dismissing the appellant\u2019s motions for a Writ of Habeas Corpus ad subjiciendum with certiorari in aid to direct the release of the appellant from the sentence of preventive detention imposed upon him by Magistrate John Hunter on April 22, 1958, at Cloverdale in the Province of British Columbia following a finding that the appellant was a criminal sexual psychopath. Norris J.A., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal.\nUnder s. 691(3) of the Criminal Code as enacted by Statutes of Canada 1964-65, c. 53, s. 1, assented to on April 3, 1965, the appellant has an appeal as of right to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal confirming the refusal of the application for a Writ of Habeas Corpus. As s. 691 does not expressly provide a right of appeal to this Court from the refusal of the relief sought in proceedings by way of certiorari, counsel for the appellant moved for leave to appeal and on October 7, 1968, this Court made an order granting leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal pronounced on June 3, 1968,\non all questions of law set forth in the Notice of Motion of the Appellant subject to argument as to the right of the Supreme Court of Canada to grant such leave.\nand granting the necessary extensions of time.\nIn this Court counsel for the appellant, pursuant to s. 61 of the Supreme Court Act, served a notice of motion returnable at the hearing of the appeal for an order that a Writ of certiorari issue out of this Court to bring up any papers or other proceedings had or taken in the Courts below that are considered necessary with a view to this appeal.\nThe appeal was first argued in this Court on December 8, 1968, before a Bench of seven and judgment was reserved. At the conclusion of the argument on that occasion the Court requested counsel to make written submissions on the question, which had been raised by the Court during the argument, whether clause (b) of s. 682 of the Criminal Code deprives the Courts of jurisdiction to grant certiorari in this case and counsel complied with this request. Later the Court directed a re-hearing. The appeal was argued on June 2nd before the full Court and judgment was reserved.\nWhile it is perhaps not altogether relevant to the questions that we are called upon to decide, I propose to set out briefly the history of the proceedings taken in this matter up to the present time so far as this can be ascertained from the somewhat fragmentary records produced in the Courts below and before us.\nOn March 6, 1958, the appellant pleaded guilty before Magistrate Hunter to a charge of committing an act of gross indecency with another male person, contrary to s. 149 of the Criminal Code.\nOn April 22, 1958, the appellant was found by Magistrate Hunter to be a criminal sexual psychopath and was sentenced to two years imprisonment on the charge of gross indecency and in addition was sentenced to preventive detention.\nOn May 18, 1958, the appellant signed a waiver stating that he had elected not to appeal from either the conviction or sentence.\nOn February 8, 1964, the appellant gave notice of an application to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time for appealing.\nOn May 7, 1965, the matter came before the Court of Appeal, composed of Bird C.J.B.C. and Davey and MacLean JJ.A. Counsel for the Crown was not called upon and the Court delivered an oral judgment refusing to grant an extention of time and refusing permission to withdraw the waiver of appeal.\nBird C.J.B.C. concluded his reasons as follows:\n\u2026In the circumstances while I am not disposed to make any direction, I would ask Crown Counsel if he would see to it that the matter is reported in detail to the Attorney-General\u2019s Department in the hope that a thorough investigation of the allegations now made by the man can be made.\nAs my brother Davey puts it, our purpose is, first of all, to make sure no injustice has been done and while it is not open to the court to investigate this situation which is alleged by Saunders at this late date we do feel there might possibly be something in what he has had to say and in those terms we would like to be sure that the matter is thoroughly investigated by the law enforcement officers in this Province.\nDavey J.A., as he then was, in the course of his reasons concurred in the suggestion that counsel for the Crown should make an investigation.\nIn September 1965, the appellant gave notice of an application for a Writ of Habeas Corpus with certiorari in aid.\nOn November 12 and 19, 1965, this application was heard by Branca J., as he then was, and on November 23, 1965, that learned Judge dismissed the application. It appears that the Warden of the Penitentiary at New Westminster, B.C., where the appellant was confined had returned to the Court the Warrant of Commitment in virtue of which the appellant was detained. It reads as follows:\nForm 18A\nSUMMARY CONVICTIONS ACT, 1955\nCRIMINAL CODE, 1953-54\nTHE GOVERNMENT OF\nTHE PROVINCE OF BRITISH COLUMBIA\nWARRANT OF COMMITTAL UPON CONVICTION\n(S.C.A. 2.51; C.C., ss. 482 and 713)\nCANADA:\nPROVINCE OF\nBRITISH COLUMBIA,\nCOUNTY OF WESTMINSTER\nMUNICIPALITY OF SURREY\nREGINA vs. SANDERS.\nTo the Peace Officers in the County of Westminster and to the Keeper of the British Columbia Penitentiary at New Westminster, B.C. Whereas Francis Stewart SANDERS hereinafter called the \u201caccused\u201d, was this day convicted upon a charge that Francis Stewart SANDERS between the 1st day of December, A.D. 1957 and the 1st day of March, A.D. 1958, at or near Newton, B.C., in the Municipality of Surrey being a male person did unlawfully commit an act of gross indecency with Roy FLACK, another male person, contrary to the form of Statute in such case made and provided.\nWhereas the said Francis Stewart SANDERS was, pursuant to Section 661 of the Criminal Code of Canada, found to be a criminal sexual psychopath, and it was adjudged that the accused for his offence be imprisoned in the British Columbia Penitentiary at New Westminster for the term of Two (2) Years, and in addition a sentence of preventative detention.\nYou are hereby commanded in Her Majesty\u2019s name to take the accused and convey him safely to the British Columbia Penitentiary at New Westminster, B.C. and deliver him to the keeper thereof, together with the following precept:\nYou, the said keeper, are hereby commanded to receive the accused into custody in the said Prison and imprison him there for the term of Two (2) Years, and in addition a sentence of preventative detention, and for so doing this is sufficient warrant.\nDated this 22nd day of April, A.D. 1958 at Clover-dale, B.C.\n(Note:\u2014There is an illegible signature on the original warrant)\nA POLICE MAGISTRATE,\nin and for the Municipality of Surrey specially authorized by the terms of his appointment to exercise jurisdiction under Part XVI of the Criminal Code.\nOAKALLA PRISON\nFARM\nRECEIVED\nAPR. 22, 1958\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\nPENITENTIARY\nNEW WESTMINSTER\nMAY 1958\nWhile the signature on this Warrant is illegible it would seem to be that of Magistrate Hunter because an affidavit sworn by him on October 13, 1965, concludes with the following paragraph:\n12. That at the conclusion of the evidence submitted on the hearing on the 22nd of April, 1958, I found that Francis Stewart Sanders was a criminal sexual psychopath, and sentenced the said Francis Stewart Sanders to a term of imprisonment for two years, and in addition thereto I imposed a sentence of preventive detention and subsequently I signed a Warrant of Committal according to my findings and sentences.\nIn his careful and detailed reasons Branca J. examined the record of the proceedings before Magistrate Hunter but held that he could not look at the evidence to determine whether the finding of the Magistrate was correct. He concluded his reasons as follows:\nI am in conclusion deeply regretful that in this case acting strictly within the supervisory area reserved to this Court in matters of this kind, that I must find that the Applicant is detained by a Warrant in all respects regular on its face and upon a charge fully within the jurisdiction of the convicting Magistrate. The Affidavit of the Applicant does not allege or disclose any jurisdictional defect.\nI hasten to say that if the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court permitted a review of the evidence in this matter, that the conviction or finding insofar as it relates to the fact that the Applicant was a criminal sexual psychopath would be forthwith quashed for the reasons stated.\nI have deliberately reviewed the evidence and the authorities at length in the hope and anxious expectation that counsel will bring this matter to the attention of other authorities who may be able at law to correct the injustice done in this case which this Court unfortunately in the circumstances and for the reasons stated is unable to do.\nThe appellant appealed from the decision of Branca J. The appeal was heard on March 24 and 25, 1966, and judgment was given at the conclusion of the hearing. Davey J.A., as he then was, based his judgment solely on s. 682(b) of the Criminal Code, holding that an appeal from the sentence of preventive detention might have been taken by the appellant but was not taken. Lord J.A. agreed. Bull J.A. expressed his agreement as follows:\nI agree that the appeal should be dismissed, but I do so with some reluctance. I say with reluctance, however, for the reason that it has appeared to me that there have been several errors committed in the actual hearing. However, despite that, I consider there was full jurisdiction in the Magistrate to make the finding and sentence that he did. As stated by my learned brother, the appeal should be dismissed.\nIt should be noted at this point that neither Branca J. nor the Court of Appeal said anything about the ground which was chiefly relied on before us, Le., that it does not appear that the notice required by s. 662(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, as it read at the time of the hearing before Magistrate Hunter, had been given to the appellant seven clear days before the hearing. It will be observed that in the passage from his reasons quoted above Branca J. said that the affidavit of the appellant did not allege any jurisdictional defect.\nThe only references to the notice contained in the appellant\u2019s affidavit were in paras. 20 and 22 which read as follows:\n20. THAT the Crown Prosecutor did not present in court proof of service of Notice of Application.\n* * *\n22. THAT the Crown Prosecutor did not file a copy of this Notice of Application with the Clerk of the Court or with the Magistrate.\nIt will be observed that these do not raise a question as to the length of notice given. It is clear from reading the whole of his reasons that Branca J. made no reference to the question whether a sufficient length of Notice of Application had been given to the appellant.\nOn March 31, 1966, the appellant filed a Notice of Motion for leave to appeal and for an extension of time for appealing from the finding of Magistrate Hunter. This application was heard on May 27, 1966, by Bird C.J.B.C., Tysoe and McFarlane, JJ.A. and judgment was given on June 7, 1966, refusing it. The reasons of the Court of Appeal, delivered by Bird C.J.B.C, set out three grounds relied on by the appellant and state that he relied on no other ground. None of these grounds raises the question of whether seven clear days notice of the application before Magistrate Hunter had been given to the appellant.\nOn May 18, 1967, the appellant gave Notice of an Application for a Writ of Habeas Corpus and certiorari in aid which was heard and dismissed by Wilson C.J. on August 7, 1967, as set out in the opening paragraph of these reasons.\nThe material before us does not contain any recorded reasons of Wilson C.J. but on August 16, 1967, the learned Chief Justice made a report to the Court of Appeal, pursuant to s. 588(1) of the Criminal Code, reading as follows:\nI have little to report on this matter. The same conviction was dealt with by Mr. Justice Branca on a previous application for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid and his written reasons, dismissing the application, were handed down November 23, 1965. I cannot improve on them. Generally I may say that since the warrant of committal was not attacked I could see no opening for habeas corpus. So far as certiorari was involved I thought Section 682 of the Criminal Code a bar and also thought that the application must be dismissed for the reasons given by Branca J., as he then was.\nIn support of his application before Wilson C.J. the appellant filed an affidavit containing ninety-six paragraphs. Paragraph 20 reads as follows:\n20. That I was not given seven clear days Notice before trial as required by Law, before the Court has jurisdiction to hold a hearing to determine if the Accused was a criminal sexual psychopath.\nIt will be observed that Wilson C.J. does not deal with the question whether Magistrate Hunter was without jurisdiction because of the alleged failure to give seven clear days notice of the application to decide whether the appellant was a criminal sexual psychopath.\nThe appeal from the decision of Wilson C.J. was heard by a Court of five Judges. As has already been stated, Norris J.A., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal. The judgment of the majority was written by Tysoe J.A. and concurred in by Bull, McFarlane and Robertson JJ.A.\nBefore examining the reasons given in the Court of Appeal it will be convenient to set out the terms of s. 691 of the Criminal Code as it now reads and read at the date of the application to Wilson C.J.\n691. (1) An appeal lies to the court of appeal from a decision granting or refusing the relief sought in proceedings by way of mandamus, certiorari or prohibition.\n(2) Except as hereinafter in this section provided, the provisions of Part XVIII apply, mutatis mutandis, to appeals under this section.\n(3) Where an application for a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum is refused by a judge of a court having jurisdiction therein, no application may again be made on the same grounds whether to the same or to another court or judge, unless fresh evidence is adduced, but an appeal from such refusal shall lie to the Court of Appeal, and where on such appeal the application is refused a further appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n(4) Where a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum is granted by any judge no appeal therefrom shall lie at the instance of any party including the Attorney General of the province concerned or the Attorney General of Canada.\n(5) Where a judgment is issued on the return of a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, an appeal therefrom lies to the Court of Appeal, and from a judgment of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, with the leave of that court, at the instance of the applicant or the Attorney General of the province concerned or the Attorney General of Canada, but not at the instance of any other party.\n(6) An appeal in habeas corpus matters shall be heard by the court to which the appeal is directed at an early date, whether in or out of the prescribed sessions of the court.\nAll the members of the Court of Appeal were of opinion that \u201cfresh evidence\u201d was adduced before Wilson C.J. in that the first transcript of the proceedings before Magistrate Hunter which had been supplied to the appellant by the Court Reporter, and which was before Branca J., was plainly incomplete and the second and much fuller transcript was not made available to the appellant until after Branca J. had delivered his judgment. This finding was clearly right and consequently the terms of subs. (3) of s. 691 did not prevent the making of the application to Wilson C.J.\nIn his reasons, Tysoe J.A. after summarizing the history of the earlier proceedings, stated the submission of the appellant that the evidence before Wilson C.J. established that the appellant had not been given seven clear days notice of the application to Magistrate Hunter for a finding that he is a criminal sexual psychopath, that consequently the Magistrate was without jurisdiction to enter upon the hearing, that the appellant is unlawfully detained and entitled ex debito justitiae to the remedy of habeas corpus. He next examined the submissions of counsel for the Crown (i) that the Warrant of Committal is valid on its face, (ii) that in these proceedings the Court cannot go behind the Warrant and (iii) that the Magistrate when proceeding under s. 661 of the Criminal Code is not an inferior court but a superior one.\nTysoe J.A. did not accept these submissions of the Crown but does not appear to have finally decided that they were untenable. He says in part:\nIf the attack on the jurisdiction of the Magistrate succeeds, the warrant of committal must fall for, in that event, it was issued by a person who was without power to issue it and so is invalid.\nI am not convinced that this submission of the Crown that the court cannot go behind the warrant of committal is sound. Accordingly, I propose to proceed with my judgment on the assumption that the Magistrate\u2019s Court is an inferior court and that the court below and this court are entitled to go behind the warrant of committal for the purpose of determining whether the Magistrate who issued the warrant of committal had jurisdiction to enter upon the hearing under Code Section 661 and to make the finding on which the warrant rested.\nIt is clear that Magistrate Hunter constituted an inferior and not a superior court. This appears from the Magistrates Act which was in force at the time of the hearing, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 195, as amended by Statutes of B.C. 1955, c. 45, now Statutes of B.C. 1962, c. 36, particularly ss. 3, 4 and 5, and from the Criminal Code s. 2(10)(b), s. 2(38)(d) and s. 659(a).\nImmediately following the passage last quoted above, Tysoe J.A. continued:\nCounsel for the Crown conceded, in my opinion, rightly, that, notwithstanding the provisions of Code Section 682 which are as follows:\n682. No conviction or order shall be removed by certiorari\n(a) where an appeal was taken, whether or not the appeal has been carried to a conclusion, or\n(b) where the defendant appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried and an appeal might have been taken, but the defendant did not appeal.\ncertiorari will lie if the learned Magistrate acted in this matter without jurisdiction to do so in the sense that he was without power to hear the Crown\u2019s application ab initio if the appellant had not in fact been given seven clear days\u2019 notice thereof.\nThis concession at first appears surprising in view of the fact that the Court of Appeal which heard the appeal from the judgment of Branca J. had based its judgment solely on the terms of s. 682 and Wilson C.J. had based his judgment in part on that section; but it must be remembered that the only occasion prior to the hearing of the appeal in the Court of Appeal from the judgment of Wilson C.J. on which the appellant was represented by counsel was on the application before Branca J. and, as already pointed out, there is nothing in the elaborate reasons of that learned Judge to suggest that the point was raised before him. The hearing of the appeal from the judgment of Wilson C.J. was the first occasion on which the argument was put forward that because of the alleged failure to give seven clear days notice the Magistrate was without jurisdiction to enter upon the hearing.\nIf it be the fact that seven clear days notice was not given to the appellant as required by s. 662(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, then the magistrate was without jurisdiction ab initio and, as was held by every member of the Court of Appeal, the warrant of committal must fall.\nThe two questions that arise are (i) whether in these proceedings the Court can inquire whether the requisite notice was given and (ii) if so, whether the finding should be that it was given. It was on the second of these questions that Norris J.A. differed from the majority in the Court of Appeal.\nOn the first question, while Tysoe J.A. accepted the concession of counsel that the right to certiorari was not taken away by s. 682 of the Criminal Code, he expressed the opinion that the concession was rightly made and examined a number of decisions in support of this conclusion. Before us counsel for the Crown contends that clause (b) of s. 682 does deprive the Courts of jurisdiction to grant certiorari in this case. In my opinion this submission should be rejected. I do not propose to refer in detail to the numerous decisions in which s. 682 has been considered by the courts, which are collected in Martin\u2019s Annual Criminal Code, 1968, at pp. 635 to 642. The great weight of authority supports the view, that was so clearly expressed by Hall C.J.Q.B., as he then was, in Regina v. Phillips[3] and by Spence J. in Regina v. Heins[4], that s. 682 is not a bar to the issue of certiorari where the proceedings sought to be questioned are invalid ab initio.\nIf the submission of counsel for the Crown on this branch of the matter were accepted it would mean that the case of Smith v. The Queen[5] was wrongly decided. In that case a motion for certiorari to quash a finding that a boy aged fourteen was a juvenile delinquent was dismissed by Campbell J. and the dismissal was affirmed by a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba. In this Court the judgments below were reversed and the finding of delinquency was quashed. It is true that s. 682 is not referred to in the reasons in this Court but it was referred to in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba by Adamson C.J. in his dissenting judgment. The decision of that Court is reported sub nom Regina v. Gerald X (or G.S.)[6]. At p. 106 the learned Chief Justice said:\nFor want of jurisdiction in an inferior Court certiorari is the appropriate remedy. Certiorari is the appropriate remedy to raise the question of proper service: 13 Can. Abr. 1706; Re Ruggles (1902), 5 Can.C.C. 163, 35 N.S.R. 57; Cr. Code, ss. 682, 683 and 691; Paulowich v. Dankochuk, 73 Can.C.C. 273, (1940) 2 D.L.R. 106, 48 Man. R. 6.\nCoyne J.A. who wrote the reasons of the majority said at p. 127:\nHere the appellant has a right of appeal under s. 37 but did not seek to exercise it. On such an appeal he could have raised all points which arise in this proceeding. The finding of delinquency by the Juvenile Court Judge was made and the fine imposed on September 23rd. The time for application for leave to appeal expired on October 3rd and the limit of any extension by special leave of time for appeal was October 23 rd. These proceedings were not instituted until November 23rd.\nI do not think it should be assumed that this Court gave no consideration to the terms of s. 682(b).\nIn my view the power to grant certiorari in aid of the Writ of habeas corpus in the case at bar was not taken away by the terms of s. 682, and the Courts below were entitled to examine the record to determine whether the Magistrate was without jurisdiction ab initio.\nI have reached this conclusion because it appears to me to accord with the great weight of judicial opinion; but if the matter were res integra my view would be the same. Clearly clause (a) of s. 682 has no application in the circumstances of the case at bar; no appeal was taken.\nThe part of s. 682 with which we are concerned is as follows:\n682. No conviction or order shall be removed by certiorari\n* * * (b) where the defendant appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried, and an appeal might have been taken, but the defendant did not appeal.\nApplying this to the facts of the case at bar, the finding of the Magistrate that the appellant was a criminal sexual psychopath (which entailed the mandatory imposition of a sentence of preventive detention) was not a \u201cconviction\u201d but it may be that it could properly be regarded as an \u201corder\u201d within the meaning of that word as used in the section. It is clear that the appellant appeared before the Magistrate and that an appeal might have been taken from the Magistrate\u2019s decision but it is equally clear that no plea was taken; the provisions of s. 661 of the Criminal Code did not contemplate the making of any plea by the person as to whom the inquiry whether he was a dangerous sexual psychopath was to be held. It follows that this case does not fall within the literal wording of s. 682.\nBut the matter does not rest there. How can it be said that \u201cthe merits were tried\u201d if in fact and in law the Magistrate who purported to conduct the \u201ctrial\u201d never acquired jurisdiction to enter upon the hearing of the application? If the requisite notice was not given then the proceedings before the Magistrate were not a trial but a nullity. On this point there was no difference of opinion in the Court of Appeal. It is clear that Tysoe J.A., who wrote for the majority, would have allowed the appeal if he had not found that the required notice was in fact given.\nThe wording of s. 662(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, as it read at the time of the hearing before Magistrate Hunter, is explicit. It is as follows:\n(b) an application under subsection (1) of section 661 shall not be heard unless seven clear days\u2019 notice thereof has been given to the accused by the prosecutor and a copy of the notice has been filed with the clerk of the court or with the magistrate, where the magistrate is acting under Part XVI.\nThe giving of the notice and the filing of a copy are clearly made conditions precedent to the right of the Magistrate to hear the application. The writ of certiorari is a very old high prerogative writ. Its purpose is to enable the Court which corresponds to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in England (in this case the Supreme Court of British Columbia) to control the action of inferior courts and to make it certain that they shall not exceed their jurisdiction. It is clear that in the case at bar it would be an appropriate remedy available to the appellant unless the right to it is taken away by the terms of s. 682. The power of Parliament to take away this remedy is not open to question; but, in my opinion, it would require clear and explicit words to bring about such a result. I have already stated my reasons for holding that the facts of the case at bar do not bring it within the terms of s. 682, even if, contrary as I venture to think to the great weight of authority, it should be held that that section is ever effective to take away the right to certiorari in cases where it is alleged that the inferior court acted without jurisdiction ab initio.\nIn seeking to ascertain the intention of Parliament it is permissible to consider the results which flow from two alternative constructions of the words of a statute. If it be the fact (a question which remains to be decided) that the notice required by s. 662(1)(b) was not given to the appellant and it is held that s. 682 has taken away the right to certiorari, then the appellant, who was without counsel, having waived his right of appeal and having let the time for appealing go by is left without any remedy although he is under sentence of imprisonment for the remainder of his life imposed by a magistrate who was without jurisdiction to make the finding that the appellant was a criminal sexual psychopath or to impose the sentence that followed such finding. I cannot think that Parliament intended such a result. When I say the appellant is left without remedy, I have not overlooked the fact that the Court of Appeal for British Columbia had, and I suppose still has, power to extend the time for appealing to that Court; but the appellant cannot claim such an extension as a right, he can but seek it as an indulgence. He has sought it twice without success. On the second of these occasions the Court of Appeal, no doubt, had knowledge of what Branca J. had said in those paragraphs of his judgment which I have quoted earlier in these reasons. On the other hand if it appears that the Magistrate acted without jurisdiction the order of certiorari would issue ex debito justitiae. In my opinion, if Parliament had intended to take away the right to certiorari in a case where an inferior court has acted without jurisdiction it would have added to the opening words of s. 682 some such words as \u201ceven from an inferior court which has acted without any jurisdiction whatever\u201d. There is no need to dilate upon the unlikelihood of Parliament having any such intention.\nFor all these reasons I am satisfied that in the case at bar the right to certiorari has not been taken away.\nHaving reached this conclusion, it would seem to become unnecessary for me to examine Mr. Kennedy\u2019s alternative argument that the Warrant of Committal returned to the Supreme Court of British Columbia, which has been set out in full above, was defective on its face in that it shows that the order under which the appellant is detained was made by an inferior court and does not show that the notice imperatively required by s. 662(1)(b) of the Criminal Code as a condition precedent to the magistrate having power to hear the application was given to the appellant and that a copy thereof was filed as required. However, as other members of the Court have examined and rejected this argument I think I should express my opinion upon it.\nIn approaching this argument is must be remembered that the appellant\u2019s application is not for certiorari simpliciter but for a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid. Section 691(3) of the Code expressly gives a right of appeal to this Court from the refusal by the Court of Appeal of an application for a writ of habeas corpus ab subjiciendum and section 61 of the Supreme Court Act gives this Court power to issue a writ of certiorari to bring up any papers or other proceedings had or taken before any court, judge or justice of the peace, that are considered necessary with a view to any inquiry, appeal or other proceeding to be had before this Court. It has already been pointed out that Mr. Kennedy applied for a writ of certiorari under s. 61. Section 691(3) of the Code and s. 61 of the Supreme Court Act must be read together. If there is a conflict between their provisions and those of section 682 of the Code then the former must prevail; generalia specialibus non derogant.\nI have reached the conclusion that the warrant of committal is defective on the ground argued by Mr. Kennedy which is recited above. It has already been pointed out that Magistrate Hunter constituted an inferior court and the rule has long been established which is stated in the following words in Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 10th ed. at page 101:\nLastly, it has been said that \u2018there is a distinction between process of superior and inferior Courts; in the former, omnia praesumuntur rite esse acta, in the latter the rule de non apparentibus et non existentibus eadem est ratio applies.\u2019 The Superior Court need not, but the inferior Court must, show jurisdiction on the face of an order.\nand at page 646:\nIt is, however, important to observe in addition to the above general remark, that, in inferior courts and proceedings by magistrates, the maxim, omnia praesumuntur rite esse acta, does not apply to give jurisdiction.\nThe italics are those of the author. These statements of the rule are fully supported by the judgment of the House of Lords, adopting the unanimous opinion of the judges, in Mayor and Aldermen of the City of London v. Richard Henry Cox et al[7], particularly at pages 262 and 263.\nTo hold that the warrant must affirmatively show that the required notice was given and a copy thereof filed will not permit the release of a person detained where the notice was in fact given and filed. In such a case an amended warrant could be filed and the provisions of s. 683 of the Code could be applied.\nWhen, as in the case at bar, it is alleged that a condition precedent to the inferior court ac- quiring jurisdiction to enter on the hearing was not fulfilled and the warrant is silent, s. 61 of the Supreme Court Act provides an expeditious method of ascertaining whether or not the allegation is well founded.\nThe applicable rule is accurately stated in Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, supra, at page 647, as follows:\nBut although it is necessary that the jurisdiction of the inferior court should appear, yet there is no particular form in which it should be made to appear. The Court above, which may control the inferior court, must be enabled, somehow or other, to see that there is jurisdiction such as will support the proceeding; but in what way it shall so see it is not material, provided it does so see it. The rule, therefore, may be stated to be, that where it appears upon the face of the proceedings that the inferior court has jurisdiction, it will be intended that the proceedings are regular; but that, unless it so appears\u2014that is, if it appear affirmatively that the inferior court has no jurisdiction, or, if it be left in doubt, whether it has jurisdiction or not\u2014no such intendment will be made. \u2018The old rule for jurisdiction is, that nothing shall be intended to be out of the jurisdiction of the superior court but that which specially appears to be so; nothing is intended to be within the jurisdiction of an inferior court but that which is expressly alleged\u2019. And again, \u2018in all proceedings in inferior courts it is necessary to show that the proceedings were within the jurisdiction of the Court\u2019.\nWhile, in my view, it is not strictly necessary as I think the proceedings below are already properly before us, I would direct the issue of a writ of certiorari pursuant to s. 61 of the Supreme Court Act to bring them here.\nThe result of all that I have said above is that, in my opinion, the Courts below had the right and the duty to examine the record of the proceedings before the Magistrate and the affidavits filed before Wilson C.J. for the purpose of ascertaining whether notice was given and a copy thereof filed as required by s. 662(1)(b), that is to say for the purpose of ascertaining whether the Magistrate had jurisdiction to enter upon the inquiry, and this Court has the same right and duty. The next question is whether the finding of the majority in the Court of Appeal, that the requisite notice was in fact given to the appellant seven clear days before the hearing, can be sustained. After a consideration of all the material in the record I have reached the conclusion that it cannot.\nWith respect I am unable to agree with the view which Tysoe J.A. expressed as follows:\nIt is my opinion that in the circumstances of this case the onus is on the appellant to establish that he did not receive the seven clear days\u2019 notice called for by Code Section 662(1)(b) and the onus is a heavy one. It seems abundantly clear that when the appellant acknowledged formally before the Magistrate that he had been served with notice as shown in the foregoing extract of the proceedings, he must have intended the Magistrate to believe that he was not questioning the adequacy of the notice given to him of the hearing of the application. This circumstance, it seems to me, adds to the onus upon the appellant to show conclusively, if he can, that be had not in fact been given the notice which he was entitled to be given under the Code Section.\nThe course of the proceedings would seem to indicate that it was not until the hearing before the Court of Appeal that the appellant realized that he was entitled to seven clear days\u2019 notice. He does not question the receipt of a notice. His whole case is that he did not receive it seven clear days before the hearing. There is no presumption that he knew of this when he acknowledged before the Magistrate that he had received notice. I agree with what was said by Lord Atkin in Evans v. Bartlam[8]:\n\u2026For my part I am not prepared to accept the view that there is in law any presumption that any one, even a judge, knows all the rules and orders of the Supreme Court. The fact is that there is not and never has been a presumption that every one knows the law. There is the rule that ignorance of the law does not excuse, a maxim of very different scope and application.\nHad the proceedings before Magistrate Hunter been properly conducted and recorded the record returned to the Supreme Court of British Columbia would have contained a copy of the notice given to the appellant and evidence, by way of affidavit of service or oral sworn testimony, showing the date on which it was served. It contains none of these. How can it be said that an onus rests upon the appellant to establish that which ought to be a matter of record?\nAs was pointed out by Norris J.A., the appellant\u2019s lengthy affidavit is largely argumentative; but there seems to be no escape from the conclusion which he seeks to draw that, if the affidavit of the constable who served the notice upon the appellant is correct in saying that the service was made at the Court House at Clover-dale, the notice could not have been served seven clear days before the hearing.\nOn this branch of the matter I am in substantial agreement with the reasons of Norris J.A. and will not repeat what he has said.\nBefore parting with this appeal, I wish to make one further observation. It is unquestionable that proceedings under s. 660 or s. 661 of the Criminal Code, in which the liberty of the accused for the remainder of his life is at stake, are strictissimi juris. At the trial of an indictable offence by the terms of s. 562 of the Code, and at the trial of an offence punishable on summary conviction by the terms of s. 708(5), an accused or his counsel may admit any fact alleged against him for the purpose of dispensing with proof thereof. Where there is no plea of guilty, an accused cannot effectively admit matters of mixed fact and law. In my opinion, it is an undesirable practice for Crown counsel to refrain from making strict proof of the giving of the notice required by the terms of s. 662(1) and to seek to rely on a loosely worded oral admission made by an accused who is not represented by counsel.\nSince writing the above I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of my brother Pigeon and wish to express my complete agreement with them.\nFor the reasons given by my brother Pigeon and for those set out above, I would allow the appeal, set aside the Orders of the Court of Appeal and of Wilson C.J., and direct that judgment be entered (i) quashing the finding of the Magistrate that the appellant is a criminal sexual psychopath, (ii) quashing the sentence of preventive detention, (iii) quashing the Warrant of Committal and (iv) ordering that the appellant be discharged from custody.\nI would make an order pursuant to s. 689 of the Criminal Code protecting the Magistrate and any officer who acted under the Order or Warrant from any civil proceedings.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.\u2014The appellant, on March 6, 1958, appeared before Magistrate Hunter, at Cloverdale, British Columbia, and pleaded guilty to a charge of committing an act of gross indecency, contrary to s. 149 of the Criminal Code, and was convicted of that offence. His criminal record contained two prior convictions for the same type of offence, and was admitted by the appellant to be correct.\nHe was not sentenced at that time, but the hearing was adjourned to a subsequent date. He appeared before the magistrate on March 28, 1958. On that occasion it appears that he was notified by the prosecutor of the intention of the latter to apply to hear evidence as to whether the appellant was a criminal sexual psychopath, because the appellant was asked to appoint one of the two psychiatrists whose evidence is required under s. 661(2) of the Code. The appellant says that he asked that his personal physician should suggest a psychiatrist.\nThe hearing was adjourned to April 15, and, on that date, again adjourned to April 22. It was on that date that the evidence was heard by the magistrate. The magistrate imposed a sentence of two years in respect of the offence charged, as to which the plea of guilty had been entered, and also imposed a sentence of preventive detention.\nThe appellant did not appeal, within the time limited for appeal. In February 1964, he applied for an extension of time within which to appeal. The application was heard on May 7, 1965, by the Court of Appeal, and was dismissed. In September, 1965, the appellant applied for a writ of habeas corpus, with certiorari in aid. One of the grounds stated was:\nTHAT the court had no jurisdiction to hear an application under section 661(1)(b), when the hearing followed immediately after conviction, the procedure laid down that the application be raised AFTER conviction and seven clear days notice, were not complied with.\nThe appellant\u2019s affidavit in support of that application contained no statement as to where or when he was served with the notice, nor did it contain any other material in support of the above submission.\nThe appellant was represented by counsel on this application, which was dismissed. The appeal from this decision was dismissed. Counsel appeared on the appeal as \u201camicus curiae\u201d as well as counsel for the Crown.\nOn March 31, 1966, the appellant applied a second time for an extension of time within which to appeal from the finding that he was a criminal sexual psychopath and the sentence of preventive detention. This application was heard on May 26 and was dismissed on June 7. Written reasons were delivered by the Chief Justice, on behalf of the Court, and I quote from those reasons:\nIn view of the submissions made by Sanders to this Court on his Motion for extension of Time made in 1965, the Court directed Crown counsel to inform the Attorney-General of the allegations which had been made by Sanders before this Court regarding prejudicial conduct of the proceedings before the Cloverdale Magistrate, with a view to a thorough investigation of all the circumstances surrounding the proceedings taken before Magistrate Hunter. Crown counsel has informed the Court during argument that such an investigation was made by an officer of the Department of the Attorney-General who reported thereon repudiating the allegations made by Sanders.\nBranca J. in his reasons for judgment in the Habeas Corpus proceedings before mentioned, criticized adversely the conduct of the proceedings before Magistrate Hunter, presumably based upon allegations of the same nature as were made by Sanders in his first motion for leave to appeal, but considered that there was not sufficient proof of prejudicial conduct of the proceedings before the trial tribunal to justify a finding that the Magistrate acted without jurisdiction.\nOn the opening of the current Motions before this Court Sanders appeared in person, stated that he wished to appear on his own behalf and did not desire legal aid counsel. He relied on the following grounds:\n1. That the Court is entitled to consider the merits of his case before determining whether or not to grant an extension of time to move for leave to appeal.\n2. The merits warrant an extension of time since it now appears from a further transcript of the proceedings before the learned Magistrate on April 22, 1958 that the transcript presented to this court on the first motion was not complete.\n3. The waiver of appeal signed by the Appellant on 18th May 1958 does not stand in the way of the granting of an extension of time to move for leave to appeal.\nHe relied on no other ground.\n* * *\nI am satisfied from examination of the transcript now produced by Sanders and particularly from the comments attributed to him at the conclusion of the proceedings on April 22, that he suffered no prejudice from the manner in which those proceedings were conducted. His concluding comment, in my judgment, affords the fullest support for the conclusion that he did not then consider he had suffered prejudice.\nIn view of Sanders\u2019 allegation of prejudice the Court has seen fit on this Motion for Extension of time to examine the record of the proceedings before the Magistrate with care. In my judgment no grounds have been shown to warrant the granting of an extension of time to permit the appellant to prosecute an appeal from the finding that he is a criminal sexual psychopath, or from the sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate.\nThe application was dismissed.\nIt was on the hearing of this application that the appellant, for the first time, produced a notice, dated March 31, 1958, addressed to him, of the intention to apply, on April 15, 1958, at Cloverdale, British Columbia, for a hearing to determine whether or not he was a criminal sexual psychopath. It bore the name of A.K. Thompson, Crown Prosecutor.\nThe application which gave rise to the present proceedings was a second application for a writ of habeas corpus, with certiorari in aid, made on May 18, 1967. The application was dismissed, and an appeal from that dismissal was heard by a court of five and was dismissed, Norris J.A. dissenting.\nTysoe J.A., who delivered the reasons of the majority, says:\nThe situation in the case before this Court is somewhat unique. Some of the records of the Magistrate\u2019s court cannot be found. All the material that was available in the court below and in this court is the warrant of committal, two transcripts of the proceedings before the Magistrate on April 22, 1958, the notice of application served upon the appellant, and the affidavits hereinafter mentioned.\nThe first transcript was supplied to the appellant by the Court Reporter and it is plainly incomplete. The second transcript was procured by the Crown and was prepared by the Court Reporter after Branca, J. had delivered his judgment. It is much fuller than the first and is certified to be \u201ca true report of the evidence and proceedings as transcribed from my shorthand notes taken on April 22nd, 1958.\u201d Insofar as service of notice of the application to Magistrate Hunter for a finding under Code Section 661 is concerned, the second transcript contains the following:\nCROWN: Your Worship, you will recall in this matter, the previous hearing, I made application under Section 661(1) of the Criminal Code and Notice has been served upon the accused and the Accused is prepared to admit it, to avoid the necessity of proof.\nMAGISTRATE: Now, Mr. Saunders, you have been served with a copy of this Notice?\nMR. SAUNDERS: Right.\nMAGISTRATE: And this is your signature on the bottom, admitting it?\nMR. SAUNDERS: Yes.\nMAGISTRATE: That is a copy of what I have here now?\nMR. SAUNDERS: Yes, that is correct. EXHIBIT 1.\nNOTICE.\nThe Notice of Application which became Exhibit 1 is not available, but the appellant has produced what he says was the Notice served upon him.\nThree of the affidavits, which are referred to in this passage, had been filed by the Crown in relation to the first application for habeas corpus to meet the allegation of insufficiency of notice.\nThe affidavit of Magistrate Hunter stated:\n7. That on the 28th day of March, 1958, at Cloverdale in the Province of British Columbia, in the presence of Francis Stewart Sanders and Crown Counsel Mr. A. Kenneth Thompson, evidence was tendered to me that satisfied me that Francis Stewart Sanders had received seven clear days\u2019 notice in writing of an application under Section 661 of the Criminal Code of Canada as it then was, to have the said Francis Stewart Sanders declared to be a criminal sexual psychopath and to have him sentenced to preventive detention.\nThe affidavit of the Crown Prosecutor, Mr. Thompson, stated:\n7. That I recall that Notice was given to Francis Stewart Sanders of our intention to proceed against him as a criminal sexual psychopath and I recall proving in Court to the satisfaction of the Magistrate that the proper Notice had been given, but I am not now able to say on what date the Notice was served upon Francis Stewart Sanders.\nThe affidavit of Corporal Dempsey of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police stated as follows:\n4. That before the hearing to have Francis Stewart Sanders declared a criminal sexual psychopath commenced, I personally served on Francis Stewart Sanders a copy of the Notice of Application to have him declared to be a sexual psychopath.\n5. That the aforesaid service took place at the Court House at Cloverdale, in the Municipality of Surrey in the Province of British Columbia.\n6. That I verily believe that the said Notice was served by me on the said Francis Stewart Sanders at least seven clear days before the commencement of the hearing, because this was the first application of this nature in which I had been involved, and I clearly recall reading the provisions of the then Criminal Code of Canada, namely Sections 661 and 662, before attending to the service on Francis Stewart Sanders.\nThe appellant filed an affidavit, which, for the first time, referred to the notice of application dated March 31, 1958, which he admitted having received. This affidavit did not state where or when it was served upon him, or, in the alternative, that he did not remember either of those matters. Instead, the affidavit says:\n18. That I was not given any verbal or written Notice prior to my Election and plea on March 6th, 1958, that a further charge would be laid, regarding being a criminal sexual psychopath.\n19. That I was not given any verbal or written Notice of Application at any time before the Raising of the Application in Court on March 28th, 1958.\n20. That I was not given seven clear days Notice before trial as required by Law, before the Court has jurisdiction to hold a hearing to determine if the Accused was a criminal sexual psychopath.\nOn the issue of adequacy of notice, the affidavit is in the form of an argument to this effect:\n1. No notice was received prior to March 28, 1958.\n2. The notice is dated March 31, 1958.\n3. Corporal Dempsey says that he effected service at the Court House at Cloverdale.\n4. The appellant was only at that Court House after March 28, on April 15 and 22.\n5. If it was served on either of those two dates, in April, the appellant did not have seven clear days\u2019 notice of the hearing on April 22.\nThe relevant sections of the Criminal Code, as they were at the time of the hearing, are the following:\n661. (1) Where an accused is convicted of\n(a) an offence under\n(i) section 136,\n(ii) section 138, (iii) section 141,\n(iv) section 147,\n(v) section 148, or\n(vi) section 149; or\n(b) an attempt to commit an offence under a provision mentioned in paragraph (a),\nthe court may, upon application, before passing sentence hear evidence as to whether the accused is a criminal sexual psychopath.\n(2) On the hearing of an application under subsection (1) the court may hear any evidence that it considers necessary, but shall hear the evidence of at least two psychiatrists, one of whom shall be nominated by the Attorney General.\n(3) Where the court finds that the accused is a criminal sexual psychopath it shall, notwithstanding anything in this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, sentence the accused to a term of imprisonment of not less than two years in respect of the offence of which he was convicted and, in addition, impose a sentence of preventive detention.\n662. (1) The following provisions apply with respect to applications under this Part, namely,\n* * *\n(b) an application under subsection (1) of section 661 shall not be heard unless seven clear days\u2019 notice thereof has been given to the accused by the prosecutor and a copy of the notice has been filed with the clerk of the court or with the magistrate, where the magistrate is acting under Part XVI.\n(2) An application under this Part shall be heard and determined before sentence is passed for the offence of which the accused is convicted and shall be heard by the court without a jury.\nThe scheme of these provisions is that, upon a person being convicted of one of the named offences, the court which convicted that person is empowered, before imposing sentence, to hear further evidence as to whether the person convicted is a criminal sexual psychopath. If he is found to be such, the court must impose a sentence of not less than two years in respect of the offence charged, and, in addition, a sentence of preventive detention. The hearing of the further evidence is not a new proceeding. It is a continuation of the proceedings which led to the conviction, and such hearing is for the purpose of determining the sentence to be imposed.\nThe present application for habeas corpus, with certiorari in aid, was dismissed by Wilson C.J. His reasons are set out in his report to the Court of Appeal, as follows:\nI have little to report on this matter. The same conviction was dealt with by Mr. Justice Branca on a previous application for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid and his written reasons, dismissing the application, were handed down November 23, 1965. I cannot improve on them. Generally I may say that since the warrant of committal was not attacked I could see no opening for habeas corpus. So far as certiorari was involved I thought Section 682 of the Criminal Code a bar and also thought that the application must be dismissed for the reasons given by Branca J., as he then was.\nSection 682 provides as follows:\n682. No conviction or order shall be removed by certiorari\n(a) where an appeal was taken, whether or not the appeal has been carried to a conclusion, or\n(b) where the defendant appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried, and an appeal might have been taken, but the defendant did not appeal.\nIn the Court of Appeal, counsel for the Crown conceded that certiorari would lie if the magistrate acted in the matter without jurisdiction, in the sense that he was without power to hear the Crown\u2019s application ab initio, if the appellant had not in fact been given seven days\u2019 notice.\nOn the first argument before this Court on December 5, 1968, counsel were requested to file written submissions respecting the application of s. 682 and these were filed. The appeal was subsequently reargued before the full Court on June 2, 1969.\nIn my opinion s. 682 does prevent the removal of the magistrate\u2019s order by certiorari, for these reasons:\n1. The sentence of preventive detention was an order. 2. The appellant had appeared before the magistrate. He pleaded guilty to the charge under s. 149. Upon his conviction for that offence, the court which had convicted him was empowered and required, upon application, to hear the additional evidence as to whether or not the appellant was a criminal sexual psychopath, and to impose sentence accordingly. No further plea in relation to this inquiry was necessary.\n3. He appeared on the hearing of the further evidence as to whether he was a criminal sexual psychopath and that issue was determined on the merits.\n4. He could have appealed, under s. 667(1), against the sentence of preventive detention, but he failed to do so within the time limited.\nIn my opinion these circumstances bring this case within the application of s, 682(b) of the Code.\nIt is, however, contended by the appellant that it cannot be said that \u201cthe merits were tried\u201d, as required by s. 682(b), if the appellant did not receive the seven days\u2019 clear notice provided for in s. 662(1)(b) because, in that event, the court would lack jurisdiction to hear the matter, and so there would be no trial at all.\nIf it can be said that those words can only be applicable in a case where the court had jurisdiction, s. 682(b) ceases to have any real meaning. The writ of certiorari is primarily concerned with the matter of jurisdiction of an inferior court. In R. v. Nat Bell Liquors, Limited[9], Lord Sumner, at the foot of page 154, describes the object of a writ of certiorari as follows: \u201cThe object is to examine the proceedings in the inferior Court to see whether its order has been made within its jurisdiction.\u201d\nIf the object of certiorari is to see whether an order has been made within the jurisdiction of an inferior court, and if certiorari is still available, notwithstanding s. 682(b), in any case in which the court lacked jurisdiction, then it would appear that the provision accomplishes very little. If the court had jurisdiction, certiorari would not lie, altogether apart from s. 682. If the court lacked jurisdiction, then, if this submission is correct, certiorari is available despite s. 682.\nIn my opinion the section was intended to apply, and by its terms does apply in a situation where, in the absence of the section, the jurisdiction of the court might have been questioned on certiorari. If the accused has appeared before the inferior court, and has entered a plea, and if, thereafter, the court has proceeded to try the issue raised by that plea upon the merits, then the accused, if he wishes to attempt to set aside the court\u2019s decision, must, if he is given by law a right to appeal, seek his redress by way of appeal only. The intention of this section was to preclude the co-existence of two remedies in those cases to which it applies, and to compel resort to appeal procedures where they are available.\nI am not overlooking the fact that certiorari is also a remedy in a case where there is a failure to observe the law in the exercise of jurisdiction as well as in a case where there has been an excess of jurisdiction. Lord Sumner, in the Nat Bell case, supra, referring to the supervision of a superior court over an inferior tribunal, said, at p. 156:\nThat supervision goes to two points: one is the area of inferior jurisdiction and the qualifications and conditions of its exercise; the other is the observance of the law in the course of its exercise.\nThere is, however, nothing in the wording of s. 682 which purports to limit its application only to cases in which the proceedings before the inferior court are being attacked on the basis of failure to observe the law in the exercise of jurisdiction, e.g., error of law on the face of the record. By its terms it applies, in any case falling within its provisions, to any attempt to remove a conviction or order by certiorari.\nNotwithstanding what appear to me to be the clear terms of s. 682, there have been decisions, in provincial courts, holding that the section does not constitute a bar to certiorari in what are sometimes referred to as \u201cexceptional cases.\u201d In Re Thibault[10], Aikins J. said this:\nSec. 682 is couched in language of the utmost clarity and if the intention of parliament in enacting this section was to wholly take away the power of a superior court to grant certiorari in those cases which fall within sec. 682, it is difficult to see how more apt or cogent language could have been selected.\nHowever, in view of the position taken by crown counsel that, notwithstanding the provisions of sec. 682, in exceptional circumstances certiorari will still lie, and bearing in mind the general principle that where an inferior court exceeds its jurisdiction, even an express provision against certiorari is ineffective to deprive a superior court of this jurisdiction: See In re Trade Union Act. 1944; Bruton v. Regina City Policemen\u2019s Assn., Local No. 155 (1945) 2 WWR 273 (Sask. C.A.); Re Toronto Newspaper Guild and Globe Printing Co. (1953) 2 SCR 18, 106 CCC 225, affirming (1952) OR 345, 102 CCC 318; and Re Dauphin (Town) and Director of Public Welfare and Close (1955-56) 17 WWR 628, 63 Man R 532, 23 CR 222, affirmed (1956) 19 WWR 97, 24 CR 238. I proceed on the assumption that in exceptional circumstances the remedy of certiorari is still available in respect of a conviction, notwithstanding the provisions of sec. 682.\nIn R. v. Phillips[11], Hall C.J.Q.B., as he then was, held that certiorari would lie in a case where the information was bad in law, for duplicity, on the basis that the proceedings were invalid ab initio.\nIn Re Krakat[12], Hughes J. held that the circumstances of the case were \u201cso exceptional\u201d that the writ could be issued \u201cex debito justitiae.\u201d The matter of complaint in that case was the conduct of the trial by the magistrate.\nIn R. v. White[13], Riley J. said at p. 357:\nI am of the opinion that the jurisdiction of the superior court, bearing in mind the doctrines of \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d and \u201cdenial of natural justice\u201d and \u201ccomplete absence of jurisdiction,\u201d is not ousted by the above statutory provision, and it would require a much more strenuously framed section so to do.\nThese are examples of cases where certiorari has issued despite the provisions of s. 682. The \u201cexceptional cases\u201d where this has been done include those in which it was said that there was absence of jurisdiction or a denial of natural justice. With respect to the views therein expressed, it does appear to me, as has been stated earlier in these reasons, that these are the very cases in which certiorari is the normal remedy. In saying that although Parliament has decreed in the broadest terms that this remedy shall not be available if the accused has pleaded, the merits tried, and a right of appeal exists, the court may still permit the issue of the writ, these decisions seem to me to constitute a refusal by the courts to apply the section in a case which the court regards as \u201cexceptional.\u201d\nThe cases so far cited are trial decisions. I now turn to consider those cases in which the matter has been considered by a court of appeal. I am considering only cases which were decided after 1955, because the provisions of s. 682(b) are substantially different from the former s. 1129 of the earlier Code.\nWe were referred to two cases in the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, R. ex. rel. Lotochinski v. Antonenko[14] and Re Wilfong[15]. In both cases certiorari was refused. In the former case Gordon J.A. cites with approval a statement by McKay J. in R. ex rel Sanderson v. Eremko[16] that: \u201cWhere there is a right of appeal from a summary conviction, a certiorari should not be granted except under special circumstances.\u201d The case cited was determined long before s. 682(b) was enacted, and there is no discussion of that provision in the Antonenko case. In the latter case s. 682 is not discussed. Reference was made to the decision of this Court in Smith v. R.[17] as follows, at p. 614:\nWith all respect, I do not think the principle adopted in Reg. v. Gerald X. (or G.S.), supra, is applicable to this case. The Supreme Court held in that case that where the court had acted without jurisdiction, or in excess of jurisdiction, the order, though discretionary, would be granted ex debito justitiae. In my view there is a great difference between the case where the court so acts, and the case where the court, acting within its jurisdiction, makes an order which may be bad in law: Vide Rex v. Stafford JJ. (1940) 2 KB 33, 109 LJKB 584; and Reg. v. Campbell (1956) 1 WLR 622, (1956) 2 All ER 280. In the former case the right to proceed by way of certiorari is granted ex debito justitiae, but in the latter, this is not necessarily so.\nI will be discussing the effect of the Smith case later in these reasons.\nThe Court of Appeal of British Columbia, in R. v. Fawcus[18], refused certiorari and did not have to decide whether s. 682 would have been a bar. Maclean J.A., giving the judgment of the Court, said, at p. 98:\nHaving reached this conclusion it is not necessary for me to decide whether s. 682(b) is a bar to certiorari in this case. It was argued by respondent\u2019s counsel that in \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d the section would not apply. All I can say is that I doubt whether there could be any \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d short of a complete lack of jurisdiction ab initio which would prevent the full application of s. 682(b) in a case where the applicant had an unrestricted right of appeal by way of trial de novo.\nIn Manitoba, in Dauphin (Town) v. Director of Public Welfare[19], Schultz J.A., delivering the judgment of the Court, said, at p. 101, in referring to the reasons of DuVal J., the trial judge:\nDuVal, J. comes to a conclusion he expresses in these words:\n\u201cThe writ of certiorari, at common law, is a prerogative writ to which, notwithstanding any statutory provisions to the contrary, recourse may be had in order to control the action of inferior jurisdictions and bring them back within the limits assigned by law, whenever there has been a failure, an absence, or an excess of jurisdiction.\u201d\nThis statement, in effect, says that where an inferior court exceeds its jurisdiction nothing Parliament says to the contrary is effective in restricting the power of the superior court to grant certiorari. The literal interpretation of sec. 682(a) seems to leave little doubt as to the intention of the legislation; that intention was to remove the right of certiorari where \u201can appeal was taken.\u201d Legislative intention seldom has been expressed in words less ambiguous or more free from doubt as to their meaning. Nevertheless an examination of the authorities would seem to indicate that DuVal, J. was correct in his statement of the law. He refers to the oft-quoted-and-followed opinion of Martin, C.J.S. in Bruton v. Regina City Policemen\u2019s Association (1945) 2 WWR 273, at 283, where the learned Chief Justice states:\n\u201cIn Canada it has been repeatedly held that an express statutory abolition of certiorari does not oust the power of the court to issue the writ or to quash a conviction if justices have acted without jurisdiction, for in such a case the inferior court has not brought itself within the terms of the statute taking away certiorari; even express words do not take away the supervising power of a superior court when there is want of jurisdiction in the inferior court.\u201d\nThis case has been adopted in a number of cases to be found in Tremeear\u2019s Supplement, supra, at p. 360. DuVal, J. refers in particular to In re Toronto Newspaper Guild and Globe Printing Co. (1953) 2 SCR 18, and concludes:\n\u201cIt would appear that no prohibition that does not expressly take away the inherent power of the superior court to exercise this very special remedy of certiorari is effective where the inferior court or administrative tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction or has declined jurisdiction.\u201d\nIn answer to this reasoning, I prefer the view expressed by Laidlaw J.A., in the Ontario Court of Appeal, in R. v. Kennedy[20]:\nIt may be said at the outset that a no certiorari clause such as is contained in s. 682 was not designed 19 [1958] O.W.N. 41 at 44, 119 C.C.C. 200. or introduced into the legislation in order to give validity to proceedings leading to conviction or an order of the Court in cases where the Court had no jurisdiction. The section in the statute was not intended to shelter an inferior Court or to permit a denial of substantive justice by a pretended exercise of jurisdiction. But it appears to me that the purpose of s. 682(b) was to prohibit two courses of proceedings at the option or choice of a person seeking to overcome and set aside a conviction or order of an inferior Court.\nWhen dealing with the possible application of s. 682 in the Court below, reference was made, as it was also made in Dauphin v. Director of Public Welfare, supra, to Toronto Newspaper Guild, Local 87, American Newspaper Guild v. Globe Printing Company[21]. The Court in that case was dealing with the conduct of an administrative board created by The Labour Relations Act, 1948 (Ont.), c. 51, which statute provided that the orders, decisions and rulings of the Board should be final and that the Board should not be restrained by certiorari or otherwise.\nKerwin J., as he then was, at p. 23, said this:\nWe start with the proposition that when an administrative tribunal has been set up by a paramount legislative body it is the intention that such tribunal keep within the powers conferred upon it. In England and in Canada the decisions have been uniform that a Superior Court is invested with the power and duty of seeing that such a tribunal as the Ontario Labour Relations Board does not act without jurisdiction.\nThis statement is in line with the view expressed in a number of decisions which hold that the enactment of a finality clause will not enable an inferior tribunal, by its own decision, to exceed its statutory jurisdiction. This proposition is based, as Kerwin J. indicates, on the presumed intention of the legislative body which creates such a tribunal that it is not to be permitted to exceed the powers conferred upon it by the legislation which created it, even though the legislation purports to make its decisions final. Section 682 of the Criminal Code is a part of a complete code dealing with criminal law, and is contained in Part XXIII wherein Parliament has legislated respecting the application, in criminal proceedings, of the extraordinary remedies of certiorari, habeas corpus, mandamus and prohibition. It is not a finality clause. It does not purport to enable an inferior tribunal to exceed its jurisdiction, or to make its decision as to its own jurisdiction final. What it does say is that if a person has taken an appeal from a decision, he shall not thereafter be entitled to certiorari. It also say that if a person pleads, and the case is tried on the merits, then, if there is a right to appeal that decision, which is not exercised, he shall not, thereafter, be entitled to certiorari.\nA person who challenges the jurisdiction of a tribunal which proposes to try him can take objection to the jurisdiction and refuse to plead, in which event certiorari is available to him. But, if he does plead, and the case then proceeds to a trial of the merits, and if he has a right of appeal, his challenge to the jurisdiction can then only be made by way of appeal.\nThere can be no doubt of the power of Parliament thus to limit the exercise of an extraordinary remedy, and it has done so in clear terms. Nor is there room here for implying a presumed intention that certiorari be available to compel an inferior tribunal to keep within its powers, because the obvious intention of s. 682 is that it is the procedure by way of appeal, and not certiorari, that, where available, should be used for that purpose.\nDoes this view of the effect of s. 682 run counter to the judgment of this Court in Smith v. R., supra? In my opinion it does not. That case involved a finding by a judge of the Winnipeg Juvenile Court that the appellant was a delinquent. An application that the finding be quashed without the actual issue of a writ of certiorari was dismissed, and an appeal to the Court of Appeal from that dismissal failed. An appeal to this Court was then taken successfully. I have examined the factums filed on the appeal and the possible application of s. 682 was never raised. No reference to the section is made in the reasons of this Court. The possible application of s. 682 was not considered in that case. I do not think the section could have been raised successfully because it seems to be clear that the juvenile was not given a proper opportunity to plead and he did not plead.\nReference has been made to the judgment of the House of Lords in Crane v. Director of Public Prosecutions[22], as an example of a trial before a court of competent jurisdiction, which was declared to be a nullity. In that case two prisoners, indicted separately, had been tried together, and both the Court of Criminal Appeal and the House of Lords held that the proceedings were a nullity.\nThe case has no direct application to the circumstances of this case, but it is of interest in that the procedure, by means of which this finding was obtained, was by way of appeal from the conviction. If Crane had not exercised his right of appeal, his conviction, though the result of proceedings which, when examined on appeal, were held to be a nullity, could not otherwise have been attacked, since it would appear that in that case, which had been tried before a Recorder at Quarter Sessions, proceedings by way of certiorari would not have been available (R. v. Boaler[23]; R. v. Justice of the Central Criminal Court[24]; R. v. Chairman, County of London Quarter Sessions[25]).\nMy interpretation of s. 682 does not necessarily involve the conclusion that Parliament intended that that which was a nullity should be validated. Even proceedings which are a nnullity, as in the Crane case, can only be shown to have been a nullity by means of some procedure before a higher court. Parliament can prescribe the nature of such a procedure, and, in my view, in s. 682 has stated, in clear terms, that, in any case falling within its provisions, that procedure must be by way of appeal, and by that means only. I do not regard this interpretation as involving the \u201cmonstrous consequences\u201d contemplated by Lord Kenyon in relation to a section of the bankruptcy statute under consideration in Fowler v. Padget[26], but, no matter what are the consequences, my view is that it is the function of Parliament to consider whether they are such as to necessitate any amendment.\nIn my opinion s. 682(b) is a bar to the removal of the order in this case by certiorari.\nIn view of this opinion it is unnecessary for me to express any view on the issue which was raised before us as to whether, in the light of the provisions of s. 691 of the Criminal Code, this Court has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from the refusal by the Court of Appeal to grant certiorari.\nThe other issue to be determined is the appeal from the refusal to grant a writ of habeas corpus. The appellant is given an express right of appeal on this issue by s. 691(3) of the Criminal Code. For the appellant it was contented that the warrant of committal was defective in that it did not disclose that the magistrate had acquired jurisdiction by the prosecutor having given to the appellant seven clear days\u2019 notice of the application, which is the notice required by s. 662(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.\nThe warrant recited that:\nWhereas Francis Stewart SANDERS hereinafter called the \u201caccused,\u201d was this day convicted upon a charge that Francis Stewart SANDERS between the 1st day of December, A.D. 1957 and the 1st day of March, A.D. 1958, at or near Newton, B.C., in the Municipality of Surrey being a male person did unlawfully commit an act of gross indecency with Roy FLACK, another male person, contrary to the form of Statute in such case made and provided.\nWhereas the said Francis Stewart SANDERS was, pursuant to Section 661 of the Criminal Code of Canada, found to be a criminal sexual psychopath, and it was adjudged that the accused for his offence be imprisoned in the British Columbia Penitentiary at New Westminster for the term of Two (2) Years, and in addition a sentence of preventative detention. The simple issue is whether it was required also to cite that he had been given seven clear days\u2019 notice of the application. None of the authorities cited by counsel for the appellant support this proposition and Form 18, in Part XXVI of the Code, does not appear to make this a necessary requirement in a warrant of committal. In my opinion this submission fails.\nEven if s. 682(b) were not to be considered as constituting a bar to proceedings by way of certiorari, it is my opinion that the appellant\u2019s appeal fails on the merits.\nThere is no doubt that the magistrate had jurisdiction to hear and determine the Crown\u2019s application that, before passing sentence, he determine whether the appellant was a criminal sexual psychopath. This is not a case in which a court purports to deal with a subject-matter which it has no lawful authority to determine. The magistrate was required by s. 662(1)(b) not to hear the application unless the appellant had received seven clear days\u2019 notice.\nOn April 22, 1958, before any evidence on the application was received, the magistrate was advised by counsel for the Crown, in the appellant\u2019s presence, that notice had been served upon the appellant, who was prepared to admit service to avoid the necessity of proof, and the appellant then admitted service of the written notice, which was filed as an exhibit. The magistrate knew, at that time, that the appellant had been made aware, on March 28, of the Crown\u2019s intention to make such an application, because it was on that date that the appellant, as he admits, had been asked to appoint one of the two psychiatrists whose evidence would be required upon such application. On these facts, the magistrate was entitled to infer, as undoubtedly he did, that all of the requirements respecting notice had been satisfied.\nIf the admission of service had not been made, then, if the proof of service had not established that the necessary notice had been given, the magistrate would have adjourned the hearing until proper notice had been given.\nIn the light of these circumstances it was incumbent upon the appellant, when he applied for certiorari in May, 1967, on the ground that he had not received adequate notice, to establish that fact by clear and positive evidence. He admitted receipt of the notice. He did not say when he received it. He did not say where it was served upon him. Nor did he say that he did not remember when or where he received it. He says only, by way of argument, that, on the basic of Corporal Dempsey\u2019s affidavit as to the place of service, and his own statement as to the dates when he was at that place, he could not have had seven clear days\u2019 notice.\nAs against this, we have the affidavit of the magistrate that he was satisfied that seven clear days\u2019 notice had been given, the affidavit of the Crown Prosecutor that he proved to the satisfaction of the magistrate that proper notice had been given, and the affidavit of Corporal Dempsey, who recalls reading the requirements of the section as to notice, and who states his belief that at least seven days\u2019 notice was given.\nThe copy of the notice, which the appellant produced as being the one served upon him, is dated March 31, 1958, and gives notice of an application to be made, pursuant to s. 661(1) of the Criminal Code, at the Court Room, Municipal Hall, Cloverdale, B.C., on April 15, 1958. The contention raised in the appellant\u2019s affidavit is that, if Corporal Dempsey\u2019s affidavit as to service on the appellant at Cloverdale is correct, he must have been served on either April 15, or April 22, 1958. This contention, however, also involves the conclusion that although Corporal Dempsey read the requirements as to notice, which call for seven clear days, he nonetheless served the appellant on the very date set in the notice for the hearing, or one week after that date. This, in the absence of any statement by the appellant as to where or when he was served, I find it hard to accept.\nI agree with the reasons of the majority of the Court of Appeal, as delivered by Tysoe J.A., who said:\nIt seems to me this is particularly a case where the appellant must produce convincing proof of his allegation that seven clear days\u2019 notice was not given him. As I have earlier said, I have no doubt he knows very well when and where the notice was given to him. Yet he has not seen fit to pledge his oath to these matters. In the light of all the circumstances, I am of the opinion that the appellant has not come forward with evidence of sufficient cogency to justify the court in saying he has discharged the onus of proof that is upon him.\nI would, therefore, dismiss this appeal.\nHALL J. (dissenting)\u2014I agree fully with the reasons of my brother the Chief Justice. I have only some observations to make regarding the interpretation and effect of s. 682 of the Criminal Code. That section reads:\n682. No conviction or order shall be removed by certiorari\n(a) where an appeal was taken, whether or not the appeal has been carried to a conclusion, or\n(b) where the defendant appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried, and an appeal might have been taken, but the defendant did not appeal.\nThe view that this section denies the right to remove the order in question here requires holding that a person convicted in a proceeding which is in law a nullity is without recourse by certiorari when that person might have appealed and it is one I cannot accept. Section 682 does not, in my opinion, achieve that result. I refuse to impute such an intention to Parliament. I believe that when Parliament said \u201cwhere the defendant appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried,\u201d it meant a lawful trial or hearing and not a proceeding which was in law a nullity.\nParliament specified that the section would be operative when:\n(1) An appeal was taken; or\n(2)(a) Where the defendant appeared;\n(b) Where the defendant pleaded;\n(c) The merits were tried;\n(d) An appeal might have been taken.\nEach of the above conditions is as essential as the others. Here, as the Chief Justice points out, no plea was taken nor was there any provision for the taking of a plea. That fact cannot be ignored. Section 682 can be invoked only when all its provisos have been met.\nIt is said that Parliament, by s. 682, has decreed in the broadest terms that certiorari shall not be available if the conditions named in the section exist. I recognize that the language used in s. 682 is quite explicit, but it is no broader or more explicit than that found in many statutes which contain privitive clauses of which the Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, is an example. The section in that Act, being s. 80, reads as follows:\nNo decision, order, direction, declaration or ruling of the Board shall be questioned or reviewed in any court, and no order shall be made or process entered, or proceedings taken in any court, whether by way of injunction, declaratory judgment, certiorari, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, or otherwise, to question, review, prohibit or restrain the Board or any of its proceedings.\nAnother example is that to be found in the Trade Union Act, 1944, 2nd Sess., c. 69 (Sask), which was dealt with by Martin C.J.S. in Bruton v. Regina City Policemen\u2019s Association[27]:, when he said:\nSec. 15 of the Act provides that there shall be no appeal from an order of the Board, and its orders shall not be reviewable by certiorari. A statutory abolition of the right to certiorari is not wholly effective, for it is clearly established by authority that, notwithstanding a provision in a statute abolishing certiorari, the Courts will still exercise the power to issue the writ where the conviction or order complained of has been made without jurisdiction. In Colonial Bank of Australasia v. Willan (1874) L.R. 5 P.C. 417, 43 L.J.P.C. 39, the authorities are reviewed by Sir James W. Colville in delivering the opinion of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council after concluding that the statute in question had taken away the power of the Courts to issue certiorari. See also Rex v. Nat Bell Liquors, Ltd. (1922) 2 W.W.R. 30, (1922) 2 AC. 128, 91 L.J.P.C. 146, 37 C.C.C. 129; Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 2nd ed., vol. 9, p. 862; Dillon on Municipal Corporations, vol. 4, 5th ed., p. 2791.\nIn Canada it has been repeatedly held that an express statutory abolition of certiorari does not oust the power of the Court to issue the writ or to quash a conviction if justices have acted without jurisdiction, for in such a case the inferior Court has not brought itself within the terms of the statute taking away certiorari; even express words do not take away the supervising power of a Superior Court when there is want of jurisdiction in the inferior Court: Rex v. Collier (1917) 51 N.S.R. 64, 28 C.C.C. 87; Rex v. Slipp; Ex parte Monahan (1928) 54 N.B.R. 550, 51 C.C.C. 15; Rex v. Cook (1908) 18 O.L.R. 215, 14 C.C.C. 495, Anglin, J. at p. 499; Rex v. Yarrow (1922) 51 O.L.R. 509, 38 C.C.C. 269, Meredith, C.J.C.P., p. 271; Rex v. Richmond (1917) 2 W.W.R. 1200, 12 Alta. L.R. 133, 29 C.C.C. 89, Stuart, J., p. 1204.\nThe explicit language of s. 80 of the Labour Relations Act above quoted did not impede this Court in Jarvis v. Associated Medical Services Inc.[28], from exercising its supervisory jurisdiction by way of certiorari once it found that the tribunal had exceeded or was without jurisdiction. I am unable to see any consistency in holding that s. 682 is an absolute bar to certiorari in a case involving the liberty of the person when equally explicit enactments denying certiorari in labour relations legislation are not so regarded. As Cartwright J. (as he then was) said in Jarvis at p. 502:\nThe effect of this section, if it receives the construction most favourable to the appellant, is to oust the jurisdiction of the superior Courts to interfere with any decision of the Board which is made in exercise of the powers conferred upon it by the Legislature; within the ambit of those powers it may err in fact or in law; but I cannot take the section to mean that if the Board purports to make an order which, on the true construction of the Act, it has no jurisdiction to make the person affected thereby is left without a remedy;\u2026\nNo form of words can prohibit this Court from determining whether the order under review was made by a tribunal having jurisdiction; in other words, the assumption of jurisdiction by the inferior tribunal is always an issue. This leads irresistibly to the conclusion that where there is no jurisdiction there cannot be a trial on the merits within the meaning of s. 682.\nMy brother Martland states in his reasons that he prefers the view expressed by Laidlaw J.A. in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Kennedy[29], where the learned justice of appeal says that it appears to him:\n\u2026that the purpose of s. 682(b) was to prohibit two courses of proceedings at the option or choice of a person seeking to overcome and set aside a conviction or order of an inferior Court.\nIn Kennedy the jurisdiction of the magistrate to enter upon the proceedings was not challenged. In the application for certiorari it was urged that the magistrate had lost jurisdiction in that: (1) no evidence was heard; (2) the conviction was made after an adjournment for more than eight days; (3) the proceedings were conducted maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause. Laidlaw J.A., after fully reviewing the record and transcript of the proceedings before the magistrate, found as a fact that there had been a trial on the merits by virtue of a plea of \u201cGuilty\u201d entered to the charge in the presence of Kennedy by his counsel and confirmed by Kennedy himself when the question was put to him directly by the magistrate. Accordingly it seems clear that Laidlaw J.A.\u2019s statement went beyond what was necessary for the decision in the case and must be regarded as obiter dicta. It is manifest also that Laidlaw J.A. was not purporting to give a definitive interpretation to s. 682(b) because he introduced his statement above quoted by saying:\nIt appears to me that the primary question for consideration in this appeal is whether or not the accused had a right to remove the proceedings before the Magistrate by certiorari into the higher Court. Section 682(b) of the Criminal Code expressly provides that no conviction or order shall be removed by certiorari \u201cwhere the defendant appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried and an appeal might have been taken, but the defendant did not appeal.\u201d It may be said at the outset that a no certiorari clause such as is contained in s. 682 was not designed or introduced into the legislation in order to give validity to proceedings leading to conviction or an order of the Court in cases where the Court had no jurisdiction. The section in the statute was not intended to shelter an inferior Court or to permit a denial of substantive justice by a pretended exercise of jurisdiction. (Emphasis added)\nThese last two sentences show that Laidlaw J.A. was not regarding s. 682(b) as an absolute bar to certiorari but only in cases where there had been a trial on the merits and an appeal might have been taken.\nOne has but to appreciate the rigid conditions precedent relating to the right to appeal from a summary conviction court under ss. 722 and 724 of the Criminal Code (see R. v. Perehudoff[30] which followed Dennis v. The Queen[31] to see how erroneous Laidlaw J.A.\u2019s obiter statement is as a general proposition.\nSection 724(1)(b), for instance, provides:\n724. (1) The following provisions apply in respect of appeals to the appeal court, namely,\n* * *\n(b) where an appeal is from a conviction or order adjudging that a fine or sum of money be paid and imposing a term of imprisonment in default of payment, the appellant shall (i) remain in custody until the appeal is heard,\n(ii) enter into a recognizance, or (iii) deposit with the summary conviction court the amount of the fine or the sum of money to be paid and an additional amount that, in the opinion of the summary conviction court, is sufficient to cover the costs of the appeal;\nThis means that a person purportedly convicted by a summary conviction court and sentenced to a fine of, say, $500 and in default of payment to imprisonment for six months must, under s. 724(1)(b) above, either remain in custody or enter into a recognizance in such amount as may be ordered (which would be an amount in excess of $500) or deposit with the Court the amount called for by s. 724(1)(b)(iii). He must do one of these things even though the person constituting the Court under s. 692(1)(g) was not in fact a person holding any judicial office as required by that subsection. If the person so convicted did not appeal but remained in custody for more than sixty days until his right to appeal had lapsed, he could have redress and be released by habeas corpus and that means that the interpretation put upon s. 682 in Kennedy that s. 682 was enacted to prohibit two courses of proceedings at the option of a person convicted falls. If, on the other hand, the person so convicted pays the fine and costs and does not appeal within the sixty days and does not find out that the conviction was made by one who was not a judicial officer until after the time for appealing has passed, he would be, under the Kennedy interpretation of s. 682, without redress at law and would have to carry the conviction for the rest of his life. I cannot accept the view that Parliament ever intended to put a person so convicted under such a handicap where the so-called conviction was made by a volunteer or by one whose term of office had expired when the \u201cconviction\u201d was made.\nThe example just given may be said to be one that may not often occur, but instances of con- victions being made by magistrates whose commissions had expired or been revoked are known. Then there are instances of magistrates with limited territorial jurisdiction who have purported to convict for an offence committed outside their territorial jurisdiction. Other examples are readily available such as where the conviction fails to disclose an offence known to the law. It cannot be doubted that a purported conviction which discloses no offence known to the law is anything but a nullity: Rex v. Perron[32], Regina v. Jones[33], and the very recent case of Regina v. Vallee[34] in which the Court of Appeal for British Columbia held that certiorari was available despite s. 682 even after a person convicted by a magistrate had appealed unsuccessfully to the County Court under Part XXIV of the Code where the \u201cconviction\u201d was for an \u201coffence\u201d not known to the law.\nCrane v. Director of Public Prosecutions[35] is an interesting case in point on the effect of proceedings which are a nullity although heard by a Court that clearly had jurisdiction to deal with the matter in the first place. In that case the House of Lords held that a trial at the Leicester Quarter Sessions was a nullity because two prisoners, indicted separately, were given in charge to the same jury and tried together. The fact that the prisoners were not jointly indicted was not brought to the notice of the Recorder or of counsel appearing in the case. Lord Parmoor said of the proceedings before the Recorder:\n\u201c\u2026there has only been a form of trial which is void ab initio\u2026\u201d and \u201cIn a void trial there is neither conviction, verdict or judgment.\u201d Yet if the Kennedy interpretation is accepted as my brother Martland holds it should be, the result is that Parliament is said to have enacted that what is in law a nullity, something void ab initio, is nevertheless to stand for all time as a lawful conviction against a person who was unlawfully convicted once the time for the limited right of appeal under Part XXIV of the Code has passed. Crane is not a certiorari case because the Court of first instance there was sitting as a Court of Oyer and Terminer to try prisoners on indictment and was not an inferior court nor was the Court in R. v. Chairman, County of London Quarter Sessions. The same observation applies to the cases of The King v. Justices of the Central Criminal Court[36] and Reg. v. Boaler[37], the Central Criminal Court being a superior court whose proceedings and decisions are not subject to review by certiorari. Therefore, the fact that certiorari was not available in Crane and the other three cases just mentioned is not relevant. No enactment similar to s. 682 entered into the consideration of these cases.\nWhen Parliament enacted s. 682, it was not done to prescribe or establish a remedy for declaring some void procedure a nullity. Instead Parliament was purporting to deprive a citizen of his ancient right to have that which is in law a nullity or made without or in excess of jurisdiction so declared by recourse to the prerogative writ of certiorari, a right which did not originate with Parliament. Accordingly, if Parliament is to extinguish that right, it must do so by explicit language, and it said explicitly that s. 682 is only to be applied where \u201cthe defendant appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried\u201d. Section 682 did not grant a remedy, but purported to extinguish a right.\nAll of which impels me to say that I must refuse to impute such an intention to Parliament adopting the language of Lord Kenyon in Fowler v. Padget[38], where he said:\nI would adopt any construction of the statute that the words will bear, in order to avoid such monstrous consequences as would manifestly ensue from the construction contended for\u2026\nI would, accordingly, allow the appeal as directed by the Chief Justice. PIGEON J. (dissenting)\u2014On March 6, 1958, appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of gross indecency. Then on April 22, considering two similar previous convictions, he was sentenced to preventive detention in addition to the sentence of two years imprisonment for the last offence. He did not have counsel, did not appeal, but, on the contrary signed, as authorized by s. 49 of the Penitentiary Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 206, a waiver of his right of appeal. Only after more than five years of imprisonment did he embark upon the numerous proceedings mentioned by my brethren. This appeal is from a judgment affirming the dismissal of an application for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid.\nI must say at the outset, that, in my opinion, proceedings leading to a sentence of preventive detention constitute a separate issue distinct from the charge following which they are instituted, while, on the contrary, the sentence imposed following a conviction is part of the issue arising out of the charge. The character of being a separate issue appears from a consideration of the provisions of the Criminal Code respecting preventing detention (Part XXI) as a whole and especially from s. 667 concerning the right of appeal in such cases. The decisions of our Court allowing appeals from such judgments by special leave under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act notwithstanding the exception of any judgment \u201cacquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence\u201d, necessarily imply that a sentence of preventive detention is pronounced in an issue separate from that in which the conviction arises (Poole v. The Queen[39]).\nIt should be noted here that when Parliament, in 1947, (c. 55, s. 18) first enacted provisions for preventive detention, no amendment to the Criminal Code was made concerning remedies other than the right of appeal. Whereas in respect of those new proceedings a right of appeal from the sentence was explicitly provided for, no amendment was made to Part XXII, Extraordinary Remedies. The new Criminal Code brought no change in that regard and nothing is to be found in it referring specifically to such proceedings under the heading Extraordinary Remedies (Part XXIII). In particular, Section 682 reads as follows:\n682. No conviction or order shall be removed by certiorari\n(a) where an appeal was taken, whether or not the appeal has been carried to a conclusion, or\n(b) where the defendant appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried, and an appeal might have been taken, but the defendant did not appeal.\nHow is subsection (b) above to be applied to a sentence of preventive detention when the procedure on an application for such a sentence does not provide for a plea by the accused? Are we to say that because he is only called upon to appear, it will suffice that he did appear and did not appeal, to deprive him of any remedy by certiorari? In a criminal matter, this does not seem possible. The deprivation of a right can only result from an explicit enactment. If the provisions found in the Code do not apply exactly because one of the conditions cannot be met, the same conclusion must be reached as under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act: the privative provision not being literally applicable to a sentence of preventive detention, it cannot be applied thereto by analogy or by extension, such a construction of a privative clause as s. 682 of the Criminal Code would be, I think, without precedent in British jurisprudence.\nThe special provisions enacted for the right of appeal show that when Parliament introduced preventive detention into our criminal law, the necessity of providing explicitly for the right of appeal mutatis mutandis was seen, the ordinary provisions concerning appeals on proceedings by indictment not being literally applicable to this new kind of proceeding. Until similar provisions concerning extraordinary remedies are laid down, we cannot do otherwise than to apply the law as it reads. For this reason, I am of the opinion that the appellant is in the same situation as in Smith v. The Queen[40], he has not pleaded.\nHaving concluded that appellant is entitled to certiorari, I must now say that, in my opinion, the record shows that it was not proved before Magistrate Hunter that seven clear days\u2019 notice was given as required imperatively by s. 662 of the Criminal Code. The record indicates that at the hearing before the Magistrate, instead of proving service of the notice by the testimony of the officer who served it, a voluntary statement before the Court by the accused was resorted to. The transcript supplied by the Court reporter is as follows:\nCROWN: Your Worship, you will recall in this matter, the previous hearing, I made application under Section 661(1) of the Criminal Code and Notice has been served upon the Accused and the Accused is prepared to admit it, to avoid the necessity of proof.\nMAGISTRATE: Now, Mr. Saunders, you have been served with a copy of this Notice?\nMR. SAUNDERS: Right.\nMAGISTRATE: And this is your signature on the bottom, admitting it?\nMR. SAUNDERS: Yes.\nMAGISTRATE: That is a copy of what I have here now?\nMR. SAUNDERS: Yes, that is correct.\nEXHIBIT 1, NOTICE.\nUnfortunately, the exhibit is lost; in the record, there is only the copy which was served upon the accused and that he recently filed with one of his affidavits. It will be noticed that appellant\u2019s admission covers only the service of the notice. No reference whatsoever is made to the date of the service, nor to the prescribed interval between the day of service and that of the hearing. In a civil case, such an admission might be sufficient due to the rule that the parties are bound by the manner in which the proceedings were conducted. In my opinion, it cannot be so in a criminal case, in face of an imperative requirement of the law and especially where the accused did not have the assistance of counsel. The principle to be followed is that which applies where no objection is made to illegal evidence; in a criminal matter, this omission does not necessarily cover the illegality.\nMoreover, I doubt that the appellant could validly admit having received the notice required by Section 662. The last subsection is as follows:\n(3) For the purposes of section 660, where the accused admits the allegations contained in the notice referred to in paragraph (b) of subsection (1), no proof of those allegations is required.\n(Even if the amendment was only made the following year (1959, c. 71, s. 30), one must obviously read paragraph (a) and not paragraph (b) in view of the reference to the purposes of Section 660).\nTo say that \u201cfor the purposes of Section 660\u201d (habitual criminals), it is not necessary to prove the allegations contained in the notice if the accused admits them, undoubtedly implies that it is always necessary to prove the facts required to be established for the purposes of s. 661 (criminal sexual psychopaths), otherwise the provision would be entirely useless. Here, we are concerned with the application of s. 661: it is therefore clear that the accused could not dispense from proving the facts by admitting them. Without expressing a firm opinion on this point, I fail to see how it can be held that this rule does not apply to the proof of a fact as essential to the validity of such proceedings as the service of a seven clear days\u2019 notice, without which Parliament expressly forbids the hearing to take place.\nIt must now be observed that nothing shows that there was on the exhibit that was lost a date of service showing that the required time had been allowed. There is no such date on the copy filed by the appellant. It is true that he himself does not enlighten us on this point, but legally it cannot be held against him. He does not have to rebut evidence that is not in the record. He needs only point out its absence.\nI do not think that it should be presumed that the lost exhibit did show that the required interval of seven clear days had been observed. The sentence having been pronounced by an inferior court, the observance of the prescribed formalities cannot be presumed. Because the exhibit was lost, proof by affidavits could no doubt have been made that this did appear on the document. It was not done.\nIn his affidavit, the Magistrate merely states that at the hearing it was proved to his satisfaction that the appellant received a notice of seven clear days. In saying this, he only repeated his finding on that point. However, it is well established that an inferior court judge cannot give himself jurisdiction by making without sufficient evidence a finding of fact on which his jurisdiction depends. As we have seen, the admission made by the appellant at the hearing was incomplete and did not show that an essential requirement had been complied with, namely seven clear days\u2019 notice. In the absence of any other evidence that this fact was proven otherwise, the only proper legal conclusion is that the Magistrate misapprehended the admission made by appellant at the hearing. He undoubtedly believed that appellant had implicitly admitted that the prescribed time had been allowed, while the actual wording does not warrant such a conclusion. As to the Crown prosecutor\u2019s affidavit, it is sufficient to say that it adds nothing to that of the Magistrate.\nThere remains the affidavit of the police officer. He also did not swear that the date of service was entered on the lost exhibit and that that date was at least seven clear days prior to the date of the hearing. All he says is that he believes he complied with the legal requirements because he remembers looking up the requirements of the Code. On the other hand, he also says that he effected service of the notice at Cloverdale. But, after March 31, which is the date of the notice according to the copy filed in the record, the authenticity of which is not disputed, appellant was at Cloverdale only on April 15 and on April 22, the day of the hearing. It is therefore impossible for the requirements as to notice to have been met by service at the place named by the police officer.\nAppellant\u2019s affidavit concerning the dates of his attendance at Cloverdale is not questioned. Furthermore, as he was a prisoner, the Crown must have been able to verify its accuracy. As no evidence was submitted to contradict that statement, this fact must now be considered as proven. The conclusion is that the officer must have been mistaken as to the required time and that the notice was not of seven clear days. Even if he did carefully read Section 662, he did not necessarily understand the meaning of \u201cseven clear days\u201d, nor correctly make the computation and he does not swear that such is the case. Since he served the notice at Cloverdale, it must have been on April 15.\nOn the whole, in my view, the police officer\u2019s affidavit does not remedy the defect in the record and it does not show that proper notice was given. This is no doubt an omission which could have been easily remedied if the accused had raised the point instead of admitting without protest what he was asked to admit. Once again, in a civil case this would no doubt amount to a waiver but, in my view, it cannot be so in a criminal case as against an imperative require- ment of the law especially with regard to an accused who was not assisted by counsel.\nHaving reached the conclusion that the Magistrate proceeded without adequate proof of a notice served in accordance with the requirements of the law, I must now, in view of the provisions of subs. (1) of s. 683 of the Criminal Code, consider whether the defect deprived the Magistrate of his jurisdiction. The provision requiring the notice cannot be more explicit:\nAn application under subsection (1) of section 661 shall not be heard unless seven clear days\u2019 notice has been given to the accused by the prosecutor\u2026\nI have underlined the words \u201cshall not be heard\u201d because to me they necessarily imply that the Magistrate does not have authority to hear the application unless the notice has really been given. The law does not say that proof must be produced to the satisfaction of the Magistrate that the notice was given. It forbids proceeding without notice. I find it impossible to see in that subsection a provision the observance whereof Parliament intended the Magistrate to be the judge. On the contrary, Parliament seems to have clearly intended to make it a condition of jurisdiction.\nIn L\u2019Alliance des Professeurs catholiques de Montr\u00e9al v. La Commission des Relations ouvri\u00e8res[41], this Court held that the respondent acted without jurisdiction in cancelling a certificate without notice to the appellant. In Regina v. County of London Quarter Sessions Appeals Committee, Ex parte Rossi[42], the English Court of Appeal, on an application for certiorari, considered an inferior court as having acted without jurisdiction for having erroneously considered as sufficient notice a registered letter which had not been delivered to the respondent. Finally, in Dennis v. The Queen[43], in the reasons for the majority, it was expressly held that, on an appeal from a summary conviction, a County Court judge was right in deciding that he had no jurisdiction because the appellant had not served the notice of appeal upon the person specified in s. 722 of the Criminal Code. All the Justices of Appeal who sat in this case have expressed the opinion that if the required notice had not in fact been served in accordance with the requirements of the Code, the Magistrate acted without jurisdiction. This is the proper conclusion. We are not dealing here with a fact to be found by the Magistrate, in which case an error cannot go to jurisdiction. On the contrary, this is a condition precedent to jurisdiction. This condition must be met before he can act validly.\nFor the above reasons, I agree with the conclusions of the Chief Justice, including that pertaining to an order pursuant to s. 689 of the Criminal Code protecting the Magistrate and officers.\nAppeal dismissed, CARTWRIGHT C.J. and HALL, SPENCE and PIGEON JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

The building was equipped with automatic sprinklers. Under contract with the owner, the defendant had undertaken to provide supervisory service for the sprinklers and S was to pay the cost of this service. Before the closing of the establishment for two weeks holidays, a fire department officer telephoned the defendant\u2019s local manager asking that special attention be given to any call coming from these premises. The following night a fire broke out and one sprinkler head was activated. The fire was put out but an hour passed before the defendant\u2019s agents gave the alarm to the firemen who were the only persons authorized to shut off the water. The agents were not told to pay special attention to the building and went to an adjoining building first, from which a signal had also been received. Under their contracts with S the plaintiffs were forced to indemnify it for damages. They obtained subrogation and sued the defendant jointly. The latter pleaded absence of fault and of privity. The trial judge ruled that the defendant had committed a fault by not, taking immediately upon receipt of the signals the necessary steps to check the situation immediately and by failing to notify the fire department without delay. He considered that this fault made the defendant liable towards S despite the absence of privity of contract. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. The Court of Appeal was right in holding that the defendant did not have a legal obligation to perform the act it is blamed for not doing, namely to call the firemen promptly on reception of the signals. The defendant is not a public service charged with the duty of watching over a whole district generally; it is a private enterprise which assumes the obligation of surveillance through an electrical system only towards those who subscribe to its service. It is true that the existence of contractual relations does not exclude the possibility of a delictual or quasi-delictual obligation arising out of the same fact. However, a fault is the first of the elements required to give rise to such responsibility.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], reversing a judgment of Brossard J. Appeal dismissed.\nL.P. de Grandpr\u00e9, Q.C., and Francis Fox, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nGustave Monette, Jr., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nPIGEON J.\u2014The appellants are the insurers of Sportland Shoe Company Limited which occupied, as tenant, a building in Montreal belonging to Mrs. Fischler, the wife of its President. As protection against fire, the building was equipped with automatic sprinklers. Under contract with the owner, the respondent had undertaken to provide supervisory service for these sprinklers and, under its lease, Sportland Shoe was to pay the cost of this service. The latter had also signed directly with the respondent another contract under which a burglar alarm service was supplied.\nOn Friday, July 5, 1957, after noon, an officer of the City of Montreal fire department, informed of the imminent closing of the establishment for two weeks holidays, went there with an investigator from an underwriters association and, together with a representative of Sportland Shoe, inspected the premises. This precaution was justified by the fact that the previous year, at the same time, a fire of criminal origin had broken out and caused considerable damage. After the visit, the fire department officer telephoned respondent\u2019s local manager, reminding him of the events of the previous year and asking that special attention be given to any call coming from these premises. The following night, a fire broke out and one sprinkler head was activated. The fire was put out, but an hour passed before the respondent\u2019s agents gave the alarm to the firemen who are the only persons authorized to shut off the water. Having received simultaneous signals from the building occupied by Sportland Shoe and from an adjoining building, the respondent\u2019s agent allegedly thought that a sudden rise of pressure only was involved not the release of a sprinkler head. Instead of alerting the firemen immediately, he waited to have men available. These men were not told to pay special attention to Sportland Shoe. Therefore, they went first to the other building and found nothing unusual. It is only later, nearly an hour after the signals were received, that they finally found out what had happened and called the firemen.\nUnder their contracts with Sportland Shoe, the appellants were forced to indemnify it for damages amounting to nearly $50,000. They obtained subrogation and sued the respondent jointly. The latter pleaded absence of fault and of privity.\nIn the Superior Court, Brossard J. ruled that the respondent had committed a fault by not taking, immediately upon receipt of the signals, the necessary steps to check the situation immediately and, if these could not be taken at once, by failing to notify the fire department without delay. He considered that this fault made respondent liable towards Sportland Shoe despite the absence of privity of contract and he estimated the damages therefrom at half the total damage, namely at $22,484.70.\nThe Court of Appeal[2] reversed this judgment. The essential reasons for the decision rendered by the Chief Justice of the Province and upon which his four brothers were in agreement were as follows:\n[TRANSLATION] It seems clear to me that the learned trial Judge was right in disregarding the contract between Dominion Electric and Mrs. Fischler. Sport-land was not a party to this contract and neither it nor its transferees could invoke it.\nIt seems clear to me also that an omission may constitute a fault, but only when there is an obligation to act, that is, to perform, either acts prescribed by the law, or acts that must be considered obligatory in view of necessary human relations (Carpentier et du Saint, R\u00e9pertoire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, tome XXXII, vis Responsabilit\u00e9 civile, n\u00b0 343, p. 883).\nIn the case at bar, the delay was due in the first place to a faulty interpretation of the signal received and then to the fact that Dominion Electrie\u2019s employees first checked the building next to the one occupied by Sportland Shoe. Did Dominion Electric have the civil obligation towards Sportland Shoe of calling the firemen as soon as the signal was received and to check first the premises of Sportland Shoe? It seems to me that this obligation is imposed neither by law, nor by necessary human relations. It seems to me that a citizen who knows, by some means, that a sprinkler system has been activated in two buildings is under no civil obligation to call the firemen and to go and check one building instead of the other. If Dominion Electric had this civil obligation, it could only be by virtue of the promise made by its manager Neely, during his conversation with Captain Rowe on July 5, 1957. But then, we are out of the field of offenses or quasi\u2011offenses. It is an obligation that Dominion Electric would have assumed through its manager. But the learned trial Judge found that this conversation did not constitute a contract and I think he is right. To his reasons, I will add the following: the evidence shows without contradiction that Neely did not have the authority to bind Dominion Electric by contract.\nMy conclusion is that Dominion Electric did not commit any fault towards Sportland Shoe because it had no obligation to perform the act it is blamed for not doing. The facts of the case at bar are not unlike those which led to our judgment in Banque de Montr\u00e9al v. Boston Insurance Company (1963, Q.B. 487) affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada (1964, S.C.R. v). I must say at first that it does not seem quite certain to me that Sportland Shoe and its transferees cannot invoke the contract between Mrs. Fischler and the respondent. However, it is not necessary to decide if Sportland Shoe actually did make itself responsible for the contract without getting this benefit because, even if it could take advantage of it, the following clause would bar the claim:\n5. It is agreed by and between the parties hereto that Dominion Company is not an insurer, and that the rates hereinafter named are based solely on the probable value of the service in the operation of the system described, and in case of failure to perform such service and a resulting loss its liability hereunder shall be limited to and fixed at the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00) as liquidated damages.\nI fail to see how in proceedings based on the contract we could avoid giving effect to this stipulation of nominal damages just as, in general, we must give effect to a stipulation of exemption from liability: Glengoil Steamship Co. v. Pilkington[3]. There is no question here of gross negligence as in the case of Canada Steamship Lines Ltd. v. The King[4]. It is equally clear that the telephone conversation did not create a separate agreement exempt from the conditions of the contract with Mrs. Fischler.\nThe only question therefore is whether the Court of Appeal was right in excluding the quasi\u2011delictual liability on which the trial Judge based his decision. In his judgment, the latter said:\n[TRANSLATION] Towards Mrs. Fischler, on the one hand, and Sportland Shoe, on the other, the defendant and its agents were in the same situation as the driver of an automobile towards his employer with whom he has contractual obligations, on the one hand, and third parties, motorists or pedestrians, on the other hand, to whom he has an obligation of care.\nWith deference to the learned Judge, the comparison is inaccurate, I must say. The obligation of the driver of an automobile towards third parties, or more accurately the duty of care lying upon him, is unmistakably established by law. Here, on the contrary, it appears to me that the Court of Appeal is right in holding that the respondent did not have a legal obligation to perform the act it is blamed for not doing, namely to call the firemen promptly on reception of the signals coming from the premises of Sportland Shoe. The respondent is not a public service charged with the duty of watching over a whole district generally, it is a private enterprise which assumes the obligation of surveillance of an establishment through an electrical system only towards those who subscribe to its service. The duty it is blamed for not performing and by reason of which it is alleged to have committed a fault involving liability is not one which falls on everybody; on the contrary, it is solely a contractual obligation.\nIt is true that the existence of contractual relations does in no way exclude the possibility of a delictual or quasi-delictual obligation arising out of the same fact. However, it is necessary for this that all the elements required to give rise to such responsibility should be found. Obviously, a fault is the first of these elements. For a fault to exist, it is essential, as appears from the wording of art. 1053 C.C., that there be either a positive damaging and non\u2011justifiable act or the omission to perform a duty towards the injured party.\nAt the hearing, as in a prolix factum, a great many cases and authors were quoted to demonstrate that a duty a breach of which is a fault may exist without an explicit legal provision proclaiming its existence. This is not doubtful but does not mean that we should consider as such a duty an obligation that does not arise from the law but solely from a contract with a third party.\nAs the Court of Appeal rightly pointed out, such a concept of civil responsibility might result in creating in favor of third parties, who are strangers to the contract, obligations more onerous than those enuring therefrom to the contracting party. This would happen whenever an exclusion or limitation of liability is stipulated. Many cases were cited respecting the responsibility of the manufacturer of a dangerous product towards persons who did not contract with him. In such cases, the source of the responsibility is the breach on the duty lying upon the manufacturer not to put such things on the market and this duty is independent of his contractual obligation, as vendor: Ross v. Dunstall[5]. The same observation applies to the owner of a leased building towards persons admitted to the premises by the lessee. The responsibility for damages resulting from a defective condition rests with him as owner and exists independently of his contractual obligations as lessor. Examples could be multiplied and in every case where quasi-delictual responsibility has been held to exist, it will be found that its basis is the existence of a duty other than one deriving solely from a contractual obligation.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs. This dismissal is adjudged on the merits because, at the start of the hearing, leave to appeal was granted without costs to the appellants; their appeal as of right was ill-founded because the amount in controversy is to be considered separately for each, however respondent on his part had failed to move to quash for that reason.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Tansey, de Grandpr\u00e9, Bergeron, Monet, Lavery & O\u2019Donnell, Montreal.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Monette, Filion, Clerk, Michaud, Barakett & L\u00e9vesque, Montreal\n[1] [1967] Que.

The Provincial Treasurer agreed to allow credit on the account of B Ltd., and G\u2019s Garage account with the Calder Treasury Branch for the amount shown on the transfers of certain of the properties. The Provincial Treasurer also agreed to lease back three of the properties for a 5-year term, at a rent equivalent to interest at 6 per cent on the values shown in the transfers, plus annual taxes. The plaintiffs, in respect of these properties, were to have the right to make additional payments, above the stipulated rental, to be applied toward the purchase back of the properties for the amounts set out in the transfers.\nThe plaintiffs alleged various breaches of this agreement upon the basis of which they sought rescission of the agreement, the return of the various properties, and repayment of moneys received by the defendant pursuant to the agreement. The defendant counterclaimed for moneys owing by OG and IG for rentals due under the leases of the properties covered by the agreement, and against G\u2019s Garage and B Ltd., on a promissory note given by the former, and for the amounts due on their current accounts by both of them.\nThe plaintiffs, in their statement of defence to the counterclaim, alleged that all acts performed and agreements entered into by the defendant, relevant to the action, were invalid because they were entered into pursuant to The Treasury Branches Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 344, and that the Act was ultra vires of the Legislature of Alberta.\nThe trial judge\u2019s finding that the complaints made by the plaintiffs did not support a claim for damages, nor for rescission, was supported unanimously by the Appellate Division. With respect to the counterclaim, the majority of the Appellate Division were of the opinion that the plaintiffs, as borrowers, were not entitled, in answer to a claim for payment by the defendant, to set up the constitutional invalidity of The Treasury Branches Act as a defence. Accordingly, they did not consider it necessary to decide that issue. All of the members of the Court, with one exception, were of the view that some of the transfers of property made pursuant to the agreement represented partial payments of indebtedness, but that the transfers of the properties which had been leased back, were given as securities for payment and not as partial payment. In the result, the judgment at trial dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s claim and allowing the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, was varied by striking out that portion of the judgment which had ordered that the defendant recover possession of those three properties. The plaintiffs appealed and the defendant cross appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting in part): The appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Mart-land, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.: Even if the contention were valid that The Treasury Branches Act was unconstitutional, as relating to banking, a matter assigned exclusively to the Parliament of Canada, and that the Provincial Treasurer had no legal authority to lend to the plaintiffs the funds which, in fact, were advanced to them, the authorities made it clear that, there being nothing illegal about the transaction, but at most, lack of authority in the Provincial Treasurer to make the advance, the plaintiffs would have no answer to an action for money had and received. Irrespective of the constitutional validity of the Act, the plaintiffs were under a legal obligation to pay back the funds of the defendant which they had received. The plaintiffs were not in a position to demand back the properties which they had transferred to repay or to secure repayment of their lawful obligation to the defendant.\nThe plea of ultra vires would afford no defence to the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, and, that being so, it was unnecessary to determine whether or not the Act was ultra vires of the Alberta Legislature.\nIt was held, further, that the transfers of the properties that were leased back were given by way of security for payment of the plaintiff\u2019s obligation.\nPer Hall and Spence JJ., dissenting in part: It was concluded that: (i) The Treasury Branches Act was ultra vires; (ii) the conduct of the treasury branches was not an exercise of the royal prerogative; (iii) regardless of the finding that the legislation was ultra vires, the defendant was entitled to recover back the moneys loaned to the plaintiffs.\nHaving found that The Treasury Branches Act was ultra vires, it followed that the agreement entered into by the plaintiffs and the Provincial Treasurer had no existence in law. That did not, of course, nullify what was actually done by the plaintiffs at that time when they transferred certain of the properties to the defendant outright. However, because the agreement was a nullity, the plaintiffs could not maintain an action on it either for rescission or damages as claimed.\nThe agreement, being a nullity, the defendant could not retain title to the properties transferred by way of security under the agreement.\n[Re Coltman; Coltman v.

Kilgour, for the intervenant.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.\u2014The facts of this case have been fully outlined in the reasons of my brother Hall, and it is not necessary to repeat them. A brief review of the pleadings is of some assistance in defining the issues in this appeal. The plaintiffs (appellants), while they alleged that the plaintiff, Green\u2019s Garage, had issued cheques totalling $76,031.97 in favour of Consolidated Finance Corporation and certain other finance companies; that the plaintiff, Breckenridge Speedway Ltd., had issued cheques totalling $36,398.49 in favour of certain finance companies; that the plaintiff, Twin Town Motors Ltd., had issued cheques totalling $20,000 in favour of certain finance companies; and that, prior to presentation of any of the said cheques, the plaintiff Oscar Green, on behalf of all these plaintiffs, had stopped payment of the cheques at the Calder Treasury Branch, made no claim for relief arising out of such allegations. They were referred to by counsel for the plaintiffs, at trial, as \u201cessential basic history to the whole transaction.\u201d\nWith respect to this aspect of the case I agree with my brother Hall that, whether or not the order to stop payment was given, the plaintiffs ratified the payment of the cheques and the learned trial judge correctly so found.\nThe substance of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was for rescission of the agreement made on December 8, 1958, by the plaintiffs Oscar Green, Irene Janet Green and Breckenridge Speedway Ltd., with the Provincial Treasurer, with respect to accounts at the Calder Treasury Branch, whereby those plaintiffs agreed to transfer to the Provincial Treasurer of Alberta properties described as: 1. The property known as Green\u2019s Garage and fixed chattels situated at Wainwright, Alberta.\n2. The property known as Green Garage, Body Shop and fixed chattels in Edmonton.\n3. The dwelling of Oscar Green and Irene Janet Green in Edmonton.\n4. The Valleyview property at Valleyview, Alberta.\n5. Glenlyon Property and Houses, acreage, Edmonton outskirts.\n6. Assignment of lease with North Star Oil Company of Green\u2019s Garage in Edmonton, with fixed chattels.\n7. Transfer in blank of Green\u2019s Garage property and fixed chattels in Edmonton.\n8. Assignment of Agreement for Sale, O.E. Campbell, Viking Motors of Viking, Alberta.\nThe Provincial Treasurer agreed to allow credit on the account of Breckenridge Speedway Limited, and Green\u2019s Garage account with the Calder Treasury Branch for the amount shown on the transfers of the property at Wainwright, the Green\u2019s Garage Body Shop property in Edmonton, the house of Oscar and Irene Janet Green in Edmonton, and the Valleyview and Glenlyon properties. The Provincial Treasurer also agreed to lease back the first three properties above mentioned, for a five-year term, at a rent equivalent to interest at 6 per cent on the values shown in the transfers, plus annual taxes. The plaintiffs, in respect of these properties, were to have the right to make additional payments, above the stipulated rental, to be applied toward the purchase back of the properties for the amounts set out in the transfers. It was also agreed that operating credits for a period of five years in an amount of $15,000 would be allowed to the plaintiffs.\nTransfers of the various properties were executed in November and December 1958, showing values as follows:\nWainwright property.......................................................\n$35,000\nGreen\u2019s Garage property, Edmonton..........................\n16,000\nGreen\u2019s house property, Edmonton.............................\n12,000\nValleyview property........................................................\n1,500\nGlenlyon property...........................................................\n6,000 The plaintiffs, in their statement of claim, alleged various breaches of this agreement upon the basis of which they sought rescission of the agreement, the return of the various properties, and repayment of moneys received by the defendant pursuant to the agreement.\nThe defendant counterclaimed for moneys owing by the plaintiffs Oscar Green and Irene Janet Green for rentals due under the leases of the properties covered by the agreement, and against Green\u2019s Garage and Breckenridge Speedway Limited, on a promissory note given by the former, and for the amounts due on their current accounts by both of them.\nIt was at this point in the pleadings that the plaintiffs, in their statement of defence to the counterclaim, alleged that all acts performed and agreements entered into by the defendant, relevant to the action, were invalid because they were entered into pursuant to The Treasury Branches Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 344 (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Act\u201d) and that the Act was ultra vires of the Legislature of Alberta.\nWith respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for rescission, the learned trial judge held:\nI have examined all the complaints made by the plaintiffs, but, in analyzing them, find they do not support a claim for damages, nor for rescission.\nHis decision on this point was supported unanimously by the Appellate Division. In my opinion, this finding should not be disturbed.\nWith respect to the counterclaim, Smith C.J.A., Johnson J.A., and Kane J.A., were of the opinion that the plaintiffs, as borrowers, were not entitled, in answer to a claim for payment by the defendant, to set up the constitutional invalidity of The Treasury Branches Act as a defence. Accordingly, they did not consider it necessary to decide that issue. Porter J.A., and Allen J.A., both held that the Act was ultra vires of the Legislature of Alberta because it related to banking, a matter assigned exclusively to the Parliament of Canada. All of the members of the Court, other than Porter J.A., were of the view that some of the transfers of property made pursuant to the agreement of December 8, 1958, represented partial payments of indebtedness, but that the transfers of the Wainwright property, the Green\u2019s Garage Body Shop property and the Green house property, which had been leased back, were given as securities for payment and not as partial payment.\nIn the result, the judgment at trial dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 claim and allowing the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, was varied by striking out that portion of the judgment which had ordered that the defendant recover possession of those three properties.\nIn my opinion, the judgment of the Appellate Division was correct, and in reaching that conclusion I do not find it necessary to determine the constitutional validity of the Act. The issues on this appeal are as to the right of the defendant to recover from the plaintiffs moneys advanced to them by the Treasury Branch, and as to the validity of the agreement of December 8, 1958, under which the defendant received title to certain properties from the plaintiffs, either by way of partial payment, or as security for payment.\nThe plea of ultra vires, in relation to the circumstances of this case, amounts to this, that the Act being unconstitutional, as relating to the matter of banking, the Provincial Treasurer had no legal authority to lend to the plaintiffs the funds which, in fact, were advanced to them. Even if this contention were valid, the authorities cited by my brother Hall, and in the reasons of Smith C.J.A. and Johnson J.A., make it clear that, there being nothing illegal about the transaction, but at most, lack of authority in the Provincial Treasurer to make the advance, the plaintiffs would have no answer to an action for money had and received. I refer only, among the cases quoted in those judgments, to Re Coltman; Coltman v. Coltman[2], and In re K.L. Tractors Ltd.[3] The position was, therefore, that, irrespective of the constitutional validity of the Act, the plaintiffs were under a legal obligation to pay back the funds of the defendant which they had received.\nHaving reached this conclusion, I turn now to consider the agreement of December 8, 1958, and the transfers of property made pursuant to it. This was a contract by the plaintiffs to transfer titles to certain properties to the defendant, either as a part payment of their indebtedness or as security for repayment. The transfers were effected in accordance with Alberta law and title passed to the defendant, as represented by the Provincial Treasurer. There is nothing in law to prevent the defendant from taking title to Alberta land.\nThe plaintiffs seek an order to compel the retransfer of the properties from the defendant to them. Their contention is that the agreement was void because it was made in the course of carrying on a banking business, which the Provincial Legislature could not authorize. However, the substance of that agreement, apart from the promise of an additional credit to the plaintiffs, which is not now in issue, was an arrangement for the repayment or the securing of repayment of an outstanding obligation. For the reasons already given, the plaintiffs do not escape that obligation even if the loans were legally unauthorized. That being so, I do not understand how the plaintiffs are in a position to demand back that which they had transferred to repay or to secure repayment of their lawful obligation to the defendant.\nA somewhat similar problem was dealt with by the Privy Council in Ayers v. The South Australian Banking Company[4]. In that case, a South Australian statute provided for the creation of a preferential lien upon wool without actual delivery of the wool to the mortgagee. The bank advanced money to a firm on the faith of receiving such a preferential lien. The action was in trover by the bank against the trustee for the creditors of the firm which had borrowed the money to recover the value of the wool. One ground of defence was that the bank\u2019s charter contained a provision declaring that it should not be lawful for the bank to advance money on the security of merchandise.\nThe bank\u2019s action succeeded. In dealing with this defence, Mellish L.J., said, at p. 558:\nAnother objection was taken by Mr. Manisty on the terms of the Charter\u2014the clause in the Charter which says, it shall not be lawful for the Bank to make advances on merchandise. Now, unquestionably, a great many questions might be raised on the effect of that clause in the Charter which may be of very great importance, but which also being of great difficulty, their Lordships do not think it necessary to give any opinion upon. There may be a question as to what are the transactions which come really within the clause, and whether this particular case does come within it. There may be also question whether, under any circumstances, the effect of violating such a provision is more than this, that the Crown may take advantage of it as a forfeiture of the Charter, but the only point which it appears to their Lordships is necessary to be determined in the present case is this, that whatever effect such a clause may have, it does not prevent property passing, either in goods or in lands, under a Conveyance or instrument which, under the ordinary circumstances of law, would pass it. The only defence which can be set up here (there is no plea of illegality) is under the plea of not possessed, that the right of property and the right of possession never passed to the Plaintiffs. Their Lordships are of opinion, that whatever other effect it has, it cannot have the effect of preventing the property passing.\nThere are additional circumstances in the present case which are favourable to the defendant. There is no question here as to the rights of other creditors of the plaintiffs. But, more important than that, there is in the present case this added feature. If the Act were unconstitutional, as the plaintiffs allege, the Provincial Treasurer, a minister of the Crown, would be in the position of having exceeded his authority in making advances of money to the plaintiff. The funds advanced were the property of the Crown, and the loan made to the plaintiffs would constitute an unauthorized disposition of Crown property, in which both the Provincial Treasurer and the plaintiffs were participants. The un- authorized act of the minister in lending the money could not affect the right of the Crown to demand repayment. The transfers of property made by the plaintiffs were not made to the Provincial Treasurer, but to the Crown. They were made either to repay or to secure repayment of the moneys which the plaintiffs are legally obligated to repay. The Crown has a valid legal title to those properties.\nThe plaintiffs cannot demand a retransfer of the properties from the Crown unless they can establish that there is no obligation on their part to repay the moneys which the properties were partially to repay, or the repayment of which they were to secure. They cannot establish that fact when, if their contention as to the unconstitutionality of the Act is correct, they are in the position of having received Crown moneys through the unauthorized act of the Crown\u2019s agent, in which they participated.\nIn the result, I am of the opinion that the plea of ultra vires would afford no defence to the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, and, that being so, it is unnecessary to determine whether or not the Act is ultra vires of the Alberta Legislature.\nThe only remaining issue is as to whether the transfers to the defendant of the lands described as the Wainwright property, Green\u2019s Garage Body Shop property, and Green\u2019s house property were outright transfers in part payment of the plaintiffs\u2019 obligation or were taken as security for payment. For the reasons given by Allen J.A., which were approved by Smith C.J.A., Johnson J.A., and Kane J.A., I would hold that these three transfers were given by way of security.\nIt is my opinion that the judgment of the Appellate Division should be sustained and, accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal, with costs, and dismiss the cross-appeal, with costs. There should be no costs payable to the intervenant.\nThe judgment of Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nHALL J. (dissenting in part)\u2014This is an appeal from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[5] from a judgment by Primrose J. The action by the appellants was for rescission of an agreement with the respondent dated December 8, 1958, and the return of certain properties transferred by the appellants to the respondent in May 1959 and for an accounting claiming that the Calder Treasury Branch had wrongfully paid certain cheques after payment thereof had been stopped. The respondent counterclaimed for possession of the properties and for judgment for the amount of certain rentals and loans. Primrose J. dismissed the appellants\u2019 action and gave judgment in favour of the respondent for possession of the properties and other relief. In their action the appellants contended that The Treasury Branches Act of the Province of Alberta was ultra vires. The Appellate Division, while holding that The Treasury Branches Act was ultra vires, nevertheless upheld the judgment of Primrose J., refusing rescission and giving judgment for the amounts claimed in the counterclaim, but held that three of the properties in question in the action had been transferred by way of security and ordered an accounting in respect of those properties. The three properties are known and mentioned throughout the evidence and the judgments as (a) \u201cGreen\u2019s Body Shop Property\u201d; (b) \u201cthe dwelling house\u201d; (c) \u201cthe Wainwright Property\u201d.\nThe appellants who were plaintiffs in the original action now appeal to this Court, claiming that Primrose J. and the Appellate Division erred in:\n1. Failing to hold that the monies paid out by the Calder Treasury Branch in meeting cheques of the Appellants presented for payment after payment had been countermanded were not recoverable.\n2. Holding that in these circumstances it was inequitable and unjust for the Appellants to raise the plea of ultra vires on the part of the Respondent in entering into agreements and taking security by way of mortgage to enforce the payment of sums paid out on the said countermanded cheques.\n3. Failing to hold that in these circumstances the Appellants could raise the plea of ultra vires. 4. Failing to find that the said agreements were made and security taken by the Calder Treasury Branch in the course of a banking business carried on by the Provincial Treasury of the Province of Alberta pursuant to, or, alternatively, in excess of the provisions of The Treasury Branches Act, being Chapter 344 of the Revised Statutes of Alberta, 1955 as amended.\n5. Failing to find that the said Treasury Branches Act was ultra vires the Province of Alberta by virtue of the provisions of The British North America Act.\n6. Failing to find that the said banking business was ultra vires the Province of Alberta by virtue of the provisions of the British North America Act.\n7. Failing to find that the said agreements made and security taken were ultra vires the Province of Alberta by virtue of the provisions of The British North America Act.\n8. Failing to hold that by reason thereof the Court would not enforce the said agreements made or security taken.\n9. Failing to hold that in the circumstances the Appellants were entitled to rescission of the said Agreements made.\nThe respondent gave notice of intention to cross-appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division in so far as it related to the Wainwright property by restoring the judgment of Primrose J. on the grounds that the respondent held this property as beneficial owner free from any equity of redemption by the appellant Breckenridge Speedway Ltd., and that none of the appellants had been in possession of the said property since 1960. On the hearing in this Court, leave to amend the cross-appeal was granted to include, in addition to the Wainwright property, the other properties known as \u201cGreen\u2019s Body Shop\u201d and \u201cthe dwelling house\u201d.\nOn October 30, 1967, Cartwright C.J. made the following order:\nIT IS ORDERED that notice of the constitutional question in the above appeal, together with a copy of the Reasons for Judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division and of this Order be served forthwith upon the Attorney General of Canada and upon the Ottawa agents for the Attorneys General of the Provinces, except the Attorney Gen- eral of the Province of Alberta, already a party herein, which constitutional question may be stated as follows:\n1. \u201cIs the Treasury Branches Act, being chap. 344 of the Revised Statutes of Alberta, as amended, ultra vires the Province of Alberta as being legislation in relation to \u2018banking\u2019 contrary to the provisions of the British North America Act?\n2. Is the business carried on by the Treasury Branches of the Province of Alberta ultra vires the Province of Alberta by reason of being a business not duty authorized by legislation?\u201d\nAND IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all applications to intervene must be made returnable before the Honourable Chief Justice of Canada in Chambers on Monday the 27th day of November, 1967 at the hour of 10:00 o\u2019clock in the forenoon.\nThe Attorney General of Canada applied to intervene and was given leave to intervene and to be represented by counsel and to file a factum. No province applied to intervene.\nThe facts giving rise to this litigation and to the determination of the constitutional question as aforesaid are involved and in the initial stages in dispute. The appellants Oscar Green and Irene Janet Green are husband and wife. At all times material to the litigation, Mrs. Green was proprietor of an automobile garage business in Edmonton, Alberta, known as \u201cGreen\u2019s Garage\u201d. The appellant Breckenridge Speedway Ltd. (hereinafter called \u201cBreckenridge\u201d) carried on a garage business at Wainwright in the same province. Both Green\u2019s Garage and Breckenridge were managed by Oscar Green.\nIn 1956 Green\u2019s Garage was selling new and used cars in Edmonton and at other places in Alberta while Breckenridge was selling new and used cars in Wainwright. New cars were obtained by Green\u2019s Garage from a sales agency known as \u201cWaterloo Motors\u201d while in Wainwright Breckenridge obtained new cars directly from the Ford Motor Company. The transactions with which this litigation is concerned involved cars financed by a company referred to in the evidence as \u201cConsolidated Finance\u201d (hereinafter called \u201cConsolidated\u201d): When Green\u2019s Garage ordered a car from Waterloo, it would be delivered subject to a chattel mortgage for the wholesale price given by Consolidated to Waterloo. Consolidated would then pay out Waterloo and deliver the car to Green\u2019s Garage, subject to a chattel mortgage given to secure Consolidated. Such a car was designated as being on \u201cwholesale finance\u201d. When Green\u2019s Garage sold the car on time under a conditional sales agreement to a customer, Green\u2019s Garage would deliver to Consolidated its cheque to clear the wholesale finance, discharging the chattel mortgage. Consolidated would then give Green\u2019s Garage a cheque to cover the proceeds to be received from the customer under the conditional sales agreement in its favour. If purchasers defaulted under their conditional sales agreements, the cars would be repossessed and put back on wholesale finance pursuant to the terms of a master agreement between Green\u2019s Garage and Consolidated, and the balance would be deducted from the amounts payable to Green\u2019s Garage on other conditional sales agreements delivered to Consolidated. This procedure involving many cars resulted in a dispute or controversy between Green\u2019s Garage and Consolidated as to Green\u2019s Garage\u2019s indebtedness to Consolidated.\nIn September 1956 Green\u2019s Garage concluded that Consolidated was improperly holding back $11,600 in respect of repossessed vehicles. To strengthen its position vis-\u00e0-vis Consolidated, Green\u2019s Garage retained conditional sales agreements covering cars sold instead of delivering them immediately to Consolidated as had been the practice. Each such agreement had attached to it a cheque from either Green\u2019s Garage or Breckenridge to Consolidated for the amount of the \u201cwholesale finance\u201d due in respect of that agreement.\nThe appellant Oscar Green testified that Green\u2019s Garage intended to hold these conditional sales agreements and cheques until the dispute over repossessed vehicles was settled with Consolidated. He further testified that during his absence one weekend about the end of September 1956, a representative from Consolidated came to Green\u2019s Garage and took away a boxful of conditional sales agreements and the cheques attached thereto. Green said he learned of this on his return on Sunday evening. The cheques in question were drawn on the Treasury Branch established at Calder (a subdivision of Edmonton) by the Provincial Treasurer of Alberta under the provisions of The Treasury Branches Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 29. Throughout 1956 Green\u2019s Garage was a depositor at the said Calder branch and had been a depositor from 1950. In 1956, when Breckenridge was incorporated, that company became a depositor at the Calder branch. In 1955 Mr. and Mrs. Green had borrowed money from the Treasury Branch at Calder and had signed promissory notes for $2,600 and $10,500 in April and November of that year respectively; in effect, the appellants and Green\u2019s Garage, as well as Breckenridge, were doing their banking business at the Calder branch of the Treasury Department.\nOscar Green testified that on the morning after he learned that the representative from Consolidated had taken the conditional sales agreements and the cheques, he notified one Skelton who was manager of the Treasury Branch in Calder to stop payment of the cheques which had been taken away by Consolidated. Green further testified that despite the explicit stop payment order, Skelton cashed the cheques, remitting the money to Consolidated. The total amount of these cheques was testified to by Green as being $198,985.86 and this produced a large overdraft in Green\u2019s Garage account. This overdraft as of October 5, 1956, was $123,322.99. On October 3, 1956, cheques totalling $36,398.49 were charged against the Breckenridge account, but as that account had a substantial credit balance no overdraft resulted.\nIt is clear from the evidence that Skelton did not have authority to extend credit to Green\u2019s Garage in the amount represented by the overdraft of October 5, 1956. Skelton continued to honour cheques for Green\u2019s Garage so that as of October 20, 1956, Green\u2019s Garage was indebted to the Treasury Branch in the sum of $142,546 and Breckenridge owed $6,680.67. The matter of Green having stopped payment of the cheques taken away by Consolidated is of vital importance in so far as the appellants are concerned. The stop order as testified to by Green was a verbal one. The learned trial judge found as a fact that the stop payment order was given. He said in this regard:\nThe matter came to a head when the plaintiffs issued cheques to the finance company and then instructed Skelton to stop payment. I have no doubt he was given these instructions, but a few days later, he went to the plaintiff Green and told him he had put through the cheques for payment.\nThe appellants rely upon this finding of fact as \u201cthe key finding, the cornerstone of appellants\u2019 case\u201d.\nThe evidence supporting this finding is meagre. Skelton did not give evidence at the trial, and it would appear from the evidence of M.H. Pitcher, liquidation officer in the head office of the Treasury Branches at Edmonton, that Green did not put forward his charge in this respect until December 1960. Green, on the other hand, testified that he told Pitcher and a Mr. Olive who was a superintendent with the Treasury Branch in or about October or November 1956 at a meeting in the office of the supervisor that he had stopped payment of the cheques but that Skelton had cashed them anyway. Nothing more is heard or said about this very important matter until Green referred to it in a letter to Pitcher dated December 17, 1960. However, be that as it may, I am unable to give the finding the effect contended for by the appellants. The evidence clearly establishes that whether or not the \u201cStop Payment\u201d order was given and disobeyed, the appellants ratified the payment of the cheques and the learned trial judge correctly so found. The appellants continued to do business with the Calder Treasury Branch on the basis that the moneys represented by these cheques had been received by them and were owing to the Treasury Branch. On October 20, 1956, they signed notes to the Treasury Branch for $140,000 representing the overdrafts in the Green\u2019s Garage and Breckenridge accounts as of that date. The evidence as of December 8, 1958, and the books of the Treasury Branch showed an indebtedness by appellants of $150,668.10.\nAt this time an agreement was entered into which will be dealt with later as it has a very important place in determining the rights of the parties, and in particular the rights of the respondent in respect of certain properties which were dealt with at that time. This agreement reads as follows:\nMR. OSCAR GREEN, MRS. IRENE JANET GREEN AND BRECKENRIDGE SPEEDWAY LTD.\nRE: ACCOUNTS CALDER TREASURY BRANCH\nIn consideration of the following documents, duly signed by the proper signing officers of the above named parties, to be transferred to the Provincial Treasurer of Alberta by Mr. Oscar Green and Mrs. Irene Janet Green, and Breckenridge Speedway Ltd.\n1. The property known as Green\u2019s Garage and fixed chattels situated at Wainwright, Alberta.\n2. The property known as Green\u2019s Garage, Body Shop and fixed chattels in Edmonton.\n3. The dwelling of Oscar Green and Irene Janet Green in Edmonton.\n4. The Valley view property at Valleyview, Alberta.\n5. Glenlyon Property and Houses, acreage, Edmonton outskirts.\n6. Assignment of lease with North Star Oil Company of Green\u2019s Garage in Edmonton, with fixed chattels.\n7. Transfer in blank of Green\u2019s Garage property and fixed chattels in Edmonton.\n8. Assignment of Agreement for Sale, O.E. Campbell, Viking Motors of Viking, Alberta.\nThe Treasury Branches will undertake to arrange a separate lease back to Oscar and Irene Janet Green and Breckenridge Speedway Limited all the above named properties, with the exception of Glenlyon; Viking Motors and Valleyview properties, on a five year lease with payments for such lease to be established in an amount sufficient to cover interest at 6% on the value set out in the Transfer and Assignment of these properties to the Provincial Treasurer, plus an amount equal to the yearly taxes on each property. Privilege will be arranged in each lease for Mr. Oscar and Irene Janet Green and Breckenridge Speedway Limited to make a payment over and above the monthly rental payments covering interest and taxes toward purchase back of the said properties for the amount set out in the said Transfer and Lease Assignment.\nThe Valleyview and Glenlyon properties will not be leased back, but will be put up for sale giving Mr. Oscar Green and Mrs. Irene Janet Green first option to buy these said properties at the same sale price that the Provincial Treasurer is offered for them.\nThe Provincial Treasurer will further undertake to arrange an operating credit for a period of five years in an amount of $15,000.00 and will receive from Oscar Green and Irene Janet Green and Breckenridge Speedway Limited, Chattel Mortgage covering all stock and movable equipment and book depts as security for the operating credit.\nCredit will be allowed by the Treasury Branches on account of Breckenridge Speedway Limited and Green\u2019s Garage Account with Calder Treasury Branch for the amount shown on the Transfers on Breckenridge Speedway Limited property at Wainwright, Green\u2019s Garage Body Shop property in Edmonton, House of Oscar and Irene Janet Green, Valleyview property and Glenlyon property.\nAny default in payments of Lease rental amounts to the Provincial Treasurer will cause such Lease in Default to be null and void giving authority to the Provincial Treasurer to cancel said Lease and dispose of said property to apply on account at will. Default is made if payment is not made within 60 days of due date and after a 30 day notice of such non-payment is mailed to the Leasee.\nAll Lease rental payments to begin on May 1st, 1959.\n(sgd.) M.H. Pitcher\nM.H. Pitcher, for Superintendent.\nPursuant to this agreement, four option leases were executed in May 1959 covering items 1, 2, 3 and 7 referred to in the agreement and were delivered to the appellants. These lease option agreements are to be read as part of the agreement of December 8, 1958. Without referring specifically to the leases, each one called for a fixed rental. For some time the appellants paid rents on the various properties covered by the leases, but ultimately ceased doing so and they were not, at the date of the trial, paying rent although still in occupation of the various properties pursuant to the leases. The \u201cWainwright\u201d property was sold after the trial and by agreement (see formal judgment) of the parties the proceeds were placed in trust and are to be treated as the \u201cWainwright\u201d property. On receipt of these lease option agreements, the respondent wrote Green\u2019s Garage on May 15, 1959, as follows:\nEdmonton, Alberta,\nMay 15th, 1959.\nGreens Garage,\nEdmonton\nDear Sirs:\nThe following will give a breakdown of total amount outstanding on Greens Garage and Breckenridge Speedway Limited accounts at the office of the Treasury Branches. This whole amount has been set up under the following headings with separate amounts making up the total liability as of May 15th, 1959, interest to May 1st, 1959.\nBreckenridge Speedway Ltd.,\nWainwright property Account........................................................\n$ 37,343.60\nGreens Garage, Edmonton, Body\nShop Property Account..................................................................\n16,977.48\nGreens Garage, E.C.

Green, when a new guarantee is completed on Treasury Branch form to be signed by Irene Janet Green and Oscar A. Green covering the amount due Greens Garage Edmonton Account.\nIt is necessary to have Mr. Green obtain authority from Breckenridge Speedway Limited to transfer $3,126.62 from Breckenridge Speedway Limited to the credit of Greens Garage Edmonton. This was an oversight in setting up the account to the credit of Greens Garage.\n(Signed) \u201cM.H. PITCHER\u201d\nM.H. Pitcher,\nfor Superintendent.\nAs will be seen, the total indebtedness claimed by respondent at this time was $150,668.10.\nThe validity of The Treasury Branches Act is directly challenged in this Court by the Attorney General of Canada and the question is also relevant to the contention by the appellants that notwithstanding their liability to repay the moneys borrowed, the fact that The Treasury Branches Act is ultra vires requires a finding that the securities and properties obtained by the respondent under the agreement of December 8, 1958, must be returned to the appellants.\nI will deal firstly with the question of the validity of The Treasury Branches Act, secondly with the liability of the appellants to repay the moneys received from the Treasury Branch even if the legislation is ultra vires, thirdly with the contention of the appellants respecting the validity and effect of the agreement of December 8, 1958, and lastly with the claim for rescission and damages.\nThe question of the validity of The Treasury Branches Act was dealt with in the Appellate Division. Smith C.J.A., with whom Johnson and Kane JJ.A. concurred, did not find it necessary to deal with the issue, holding that the appellants could not in any event raise the question of ultra vires in this action. This was, of course, before the Attorney General of Canada intervened to challenge the validity of The Treasury Branches Act. Johnson J.A. agreed with Smith C.J.A. and Allen J.A. that the agreement of December 8, 1958, created equitable mortgages in respect of \u201cGreen\u2019s Body Shop Property\u201d, \u201cthe dwelling house\u201d and \u201cthe Wainwright Property\u201d. Porter and Allen JJ.A., in separate judgments, held The Treasury Branches Act to be ultra vires. Both held that the appellants were not precluded in this action from raising the question of ultra vires. Allen J.A. said in this regard:\nIt is, of course, obvious from the disposition which I would make of this appeal that I do not consider the plaintiffs are in any way precluded from raising the question of the ultra vires nature of their transactions with the treasury branches in this action.\nPorter J.A. said:\nBut it is urged by the defendant that the plaintiffs are precluded by law from raising as a defence to the counterclaim as it affects the so-called conveyances the invalidity of the statute creating the treasury branches.\nIf this be so, we arrive at the anomalous position that the defendant may have judgment for the money, keep the conveyed property and enforce its security. What has the subject done that this court should say to him and to his creditors, if any, that the Crown can keep his property as a benefit in a transaction it could not make?\nI agree with these views. The respondent can recover the moneys loaned not because the appellants cannot raise the ultra vires issue but because regardless of that issue they must return the moneys they received. I do not think that I can usefully add anything to the reasons of Porter J.A.[6] in this regard. He went fully into the history of the legislation and its relationship to banking, and concluded by saying:\nIn my view The Treasury Branches Act is invalid as trenching upon a legislative field into which it is prohibited from entering by reason of the assignment of the exclusive legislative right therein to Canada.\nI am also in agreement with Porter J.A.\u2019s view that the operation of the treasury branches cannot be upheld as being an exercise of the royal prerogative and valid regardless of the statute being ultra vires. Porter J.A. dealt with this argument as follows:\nAs will be seen from the subsequent discussion of the Treasury Branch legislation, the power of the Crown to conduct the treasury branches sprang from legislation, namely, The Treasury Branches Act. The operation of the treasury branches cannot therefore be an exercise of the prerogative which is created and limited by common law and does not flow from statute. 7 Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 3rd ed., p. 221:\n463.\u2026 The royal prerogative may be defined as being that pre-eminence which the Sovereign enjoys over and above all other persons by virtue of the common law, but out of its ordinary course, in right of her regal dignity, and comprehends all the special dignities, liberties, privileges, powers and royalties allowed by the common law to the Crown of England.\n464\u2026. The prerogative is thus created and limited by the common law, and the Sovereign can claim no prerogatives except such as the law allows, nor such as are contrary to Magna Carta, or any other statute, or to the liberties of the subject.\nMoreover, the prerogative of the Crown in the right of the Province is co-extensive with the division of the legislative powers made by the British North America Act as between federal and provincial power, and the prerogative of the Crown in the right of the Province could not extend to the operations purporting to be authorized by The Treasury Branches Act unless The Treasury Branches Act is within the legislative authority of the Province. In Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Company Limited v. Rex, [1916] 1 A.C. 566, at p. 580, Viscount Haldane said:\n\u201c\u2026the distribution under the new grant of executive authority in substance follows the distribution under the new grant of legislative powers.\u201d\nWith respect, I cannot agree with the learned trial judge that the conduct of the treasury branches is an exercise of the royal prerogative.\nThe fact that The Treasury Branches Act is ultra vires cannot deprive the respondent of the right to recover the moneys loaned to the appellants as moneys had and received. The law in this regard is aptly stated by Lush J. in Brougham v. Dwyer[7]. This was an action to recover moneys as had and received a loan made by a company by way of overdraft when the company was not permitted to loan in this manner. Lush J. said at p. 505:\nWhen one considers the real meaning of the expression that it was ultra vires on the part of the building society to enter into this transaction, the whole case becomes plain. The directors of the society purporting to act on behalf of the building society, and to make a contract on its behalf, lent the society\u2019s money to the defendant by way of an overdraft. It turned out that in point of law the building society were incompetent to make such a contract, and it followed that the contract which the directors thought they were making was not a contract at all, but was simply a transaction which in point of law did not exist. The consequence was that the defendant had received moneys belonging to the building society under a transaction which had no validity of any sort or kind. If the matter stood there, I should have thought it plain that there being no contract an action for money had and received would lie.\nand later:\nBut when one remembers the meaning of ultra vires the position is different. The contract was only no contract because the building society were unable to enter into it. There was nothing wrong in the contract itself or anything illegal in its nature, but the society being incompetent to make it, it did not exist in point of law. That being so the action was maintainable, and the defendant had no answer to it. It was an action brought for money lent under a transaction which was thought to be valid but which was in fact not valid. On principle I can see no possible reason why such an action should not be maintainable, and the Court of Appeal in Re Coltman; Coltman v. Coltman (1881), 19 Ch. D. 64, clearly decided that in a case such as the present assuming the contract not to be illegal, there would be no answer to the action. I am therefore of opinion that there was no defence to the present action, and the appeal must accordingly be allowed.\nI am accordingly in agreement with Smith C.J.A. when, in his reasons, he said:\nI have no doubt that money lent by the Province of Alberta in the course of carrying on the business of a treasury branch may be recovered with interest even though the carrying on by the Province of the business of operating the treasury branch and the lending of money in that operation was beyond the powers of the Province under the British North America Act.\nIt should be noted that the appellants do not dispute this proposition. They say in their factum:\nIt has never been suggested that if the transactions are set aside, the Appellants seek to defeat repayment of monies properly paid out for their use and benefit.\n* * *\nObviously a borrower cannot be allowed to cheat his lender by saying the lender had no power to loan. No court is so powerless as to permit itself to be used as a vehicle to defraud a creditor. Although the terminology has not been settled the principle seems clear. It simply could not be done. The doctrine of ultra-vires is raised here to set aside an agreement for the purpose of restoring the parties to their original position each party accounting to the other for money had and received.\nThe appellants were seeking to avoid payment only of the amount of the cheques which Primrose J. found had been paid after payment thereof had been countermanded. Payment of the amount of these cheques was being resisted, not on the ground of ultra vires but on the ground that where a banker pays a cheque, the payment of which has been countermanded, he cannot recover from his customer. That issue has been resolved against the appellants because as Primrose J. correctly found the appellants ratified the payment of the cheques.\nHaving concluded: (1) that The Treasury Branches Act of Alberta is ultra vires; (2) that the conduct of the treasury branches is not an exercise of the royal prerogative; (3) that regardless of the finding that the legislation is ultra vires, the respondent is entitled to recover back the moneys loaned to the appellants, including the amount of the countermanded cheques, the question remains as to the effect and consequences arising from the agreement of December 8, 1958, and the securities transferred pursuant to that agreement. Two matters require decision in this regard: (1) were any or all of the properties transferred to the respondent pursuant to the agreement of December 8, 1958, so transferred as payment pro tanto on the appellants\u2019 indebtedness to the respondent or as security for the said indebtedness; (2) the rate of interest the moneys advanced should carry from time to time.\nAllen J.A., with whom the majority of the Appellate Division concurred, held that three of the properties transferred in May 1959 were transferred as payment pro tanto on the appellants\u2019 indebtedness existing at that time. I agree with this finding. The language of the agreement of December 8, 1958, is quite clear on this point. Being in possession of moneys belonging to the respondent, the appellants were under an obligation to return the moneys loaned to them and it appears to me that repayment could be made in kind as well as in cash. Title to these properties being items 4, 5 and 8 as set out in the agreement of December 8, 1958, will remain in the respondent free of any claim thereto by or on behalf of the appellants or any of them. The appellants are, of course, entitled to be given credit for the value agreed upon at the time for these properties as shown in the letter of May 15, 1959, totalling $12,053.59.\nAs to the other properties being those which, under the agreement of December 8, 1958, were to remain in the possession of the appellants and leased back to them and which were, in fact, so leased back, the formal judgment in the Appellate Division provided in part that the judgment of the learned trial judge should be varied by striking out the orders for possession of the following properties: (a) the property known as \u201cGreen\u2019s Body Shop\u201d; (b) the property known as \u201cthe dwelling house\u201d; (c) the property known as \u201cthe Wainwright property\u201d and also striking out directions for the removal of the caveats against Green\u2019s Body Shop and the dwelling house. The formal judgment also gave effect to an agreement entered into between the parties staying execution pending the appeal to this Court and providing for the sum of $25,000 which had been realized from the sale of the Wainwright property should be paid into an interest-bearing trust account and dealt with as the Wainwright property. The formal judgment also provided that there should be no costs to any party.\nHaving found The Treasury Branches Act to be ultra vires, that fact and finding cannot then be ignored. I agree with Porter J.A. when he said:\nThe cases on ultra vires are all founded on the principle that the person who deals with an entity of limited capacity cannot take advantage of its limitations for his own profit. The law does not enforce the contract; it treats it as non-existent, and compels payment or return of property on the basis that it would be unconscionable to enrich a receiver of the benefit. The contract being non-existent, the law precludes the plaintiffs from keeping the money regarding such conduct as unconscionable that would result in unjust enrichment. But it is urged that though the plaintiffs cannot keep the money the Crown should be able to keep the security and thus take the benefit from and be enriched by a transaction which in law it did not make. Surely the transaction is a nullity for all purposes and not just a nullity against the subject.\nbut I differ from him and agree with Allen J.A. as to the three properties transferred as payment pro tanto and not by way of security in May 1959. As previously stated, if the appellants had made a cash payment of $12,053.59 at the time instead of transferring the three properties they could not, by any process, recover back moneys so paid, and I see no difference from the fact that the payment was made by an outright transfer of properties at agreed valuations. Being under obligation to repay, their act in repaying is a valid one notwithstanding that the agreement itself has no legal effect and is in law a nullity.\nIn the accounting now ordered the appellants should be charged interest at the legal rate of five per cent per annum regardless of the rate stipulated in the promissory notes or other securities taken when the moneys were received by the appellants because the respondent does not recover on the securities but as moneys had and received. The moneys in the hands of the appellants, the borrowers, as a result of the ultra vires loans are in reality moneys belonging to the respondent and are recoverable by the respondent not as in an action in contract or tort but in an action for restitution for moneys had and received: Brooks & Co. v. Blackburn Benefit Society[8].\nThere should be a full and complete accounting to determine the amount payable by the appellants to the respondent in respect of the moneys loaned to the appellants from time to time which have not been repaid with interest as aforesaid, allowing credit for all payments made by the appellants under the lease option agreements and charging the appellants for all amounts properly expended by the respondent for taxes, upkeep and maintenance of the said properties including interest thereon, and the respondent should have judgment against the appellants severally for the amounts of their respective indebtedness to the respondent arrived at pursuant to the accounting and allowance of interest as above provided. The accounting should begin as of the date in September 1956 when the disputed cheques to Consolidated were cashed and the proceeds remitted to Consolidated. The agreement of December 8, 1958, being a nullity, the respondent cannot retain title to the properties transferred by way of security under the agreement. The respondent will reconvey these properties (other than \u201cthe Wainwright property\u201d which has been sold) so that title thereto may vest in the appellant from whom title was received in May 1959.\nI have lastly to deal with the claim of the appellants for rescission of the agreement of December 8, 1958. In this connection the appellants, having succeeded in their contention that The Treasury Branches Act is ultra vires, it follows that the agreement of December 8, 1958, has no existence in law: Brougham v. Dwyer (supra). That does not, of course, nullify what was actually done by the appellants at that time when, as I have found, they transferred properties to the respondent outright at an agreed valuation of $12,053.59. However, because the agreement is a nullity, the appellants cannot maintain an action on it either for rescission or damages as claimed. The learned trial judge dismissed the claim for rescission and damages on the merits. On the basis that the agreement has no existence in law, I do not find it necessary to go into the merits on these issues.\nIn the result, there will be a declaration that The Treasury Branches Act is ultra vires. There will be an accounting as aforesaid and fixing the rate of interest in the said accounting at the legal rate of five per cent per annum from the date the various amounts were received by the several appellants. The respondent will have judgment for the amounts and interest thereon which the said accounting will show was received by the individual appellants, Breckenridge Speedway Limited, Oscar Green and Irene Janet Green. Title to the properties known as \u201cGreen\u2019s Body Shop\u201d and \u201cthe dwelling house\u201d will be transferred back to the transferors thereof and the sum of $25,000 and interest accruing thereon being held in trust as representing \u201cthe Wainwright property\u201d will be credited to Breckenridge Speedway Limited in the said accounting.\nAs to costs, the appellants have failed in their main claim to have deleted from the moneys owing by them the amounts of the disputed cheques to Consolidated and they have also failed in respect of the three pieces of property transferred in May 1959 as payment on account. The respondent has failed in her cross\u2011appeal. In the circumstances, there should be no costs to the appellants or the respondent in this Court.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs, Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting in part.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Macdonald, Spitz and Lavallee, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Clement, Irving, Mustard and Rodney, Edmonton.\nSolicitor for the intervenant: The Attorney General of Canada.\n[1] (1967), 61 W.W.R. 257.\n[2] (1881), 19 Ch.D. 64.\n[3] (1961), 106 C.L.R. 318.\n[4] (1871), L.R. 3 P.C. 548.\n[5] (1967), 61 W.W.R. 257.\n[6] (1967), 61 W.W.R. 257 at 270-279.\n[7] (1913), 108 L.T. 504.\n[8] (1884), 9 App. Cas. 857.\n",

(Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1969: February 17, 18, 19; 1969: October 7.\nPresent: Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nDamages\u2014Breach of contract to carry out exploratory work on mining properties\u2014Measure of damages\u2014Award equivalent to cost of performance of work.\nDV and S were parties to an agreement under which DV, the owner of certain mining properties, granted to S an exclusive right, at S\u2019s expense, to explore and develop those properties. The agreement contemplated four stages of development, the first of which was exploratory. S was given the right to elect whether or not it would proceed from the first to the second stage, and, as matters turned out, it never did so proceed.\nUnder the provisions of an amending agreement: 1. S withdrew and cancelled a notice of intention to enter the second period of development. 2. DV withdrew a notice of default and excused S from any further work described in Schedule \u201cF\u201d to the principal agreement. 3. The first development period was extended. 4. S covenanted to perform the work outlined in Schedule \u201cA\u201d to the amending agreement. 5. The provisions of the principal agreement, subject to the amendments made by the amending agreement, were confirmed.\nAlthough some preparatory organizational work was done to implement the amending agreement, nothing was done by S on the ground to carry out the work called for by Schedule \u201cA\u201d. S shut down the operation.\nNo notice of extension of the first development period was given by S, nor did S give notice of intention to undertake the second development period. It was admitted that the agreement came to an end, and that S was in breach of its contractual obligation to carry out the work prescribed in Schedule \u201cA\u201d which it had agreed to perform. In an action brought by DV against S for damages for breach of contract, the trial judge gave judgment for the plaintiff, the award for non-performance of the Schedule \u201cA\u201d work being $314,051 based on evidence as to the cost of performing such work. S\u2019s appeal from this judgment was dismissed, unanimously, by the Court of Appeal, and a cross-appeal by DV seeking an increase in this award was allowed, the damages being increased by $64,976. An appeal to this Court was based solely on the measure of damages.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe submissions made on behalf of S failed to persuade the Court that, in the circumstances of the case, the Courts below were in error in awarding to DV damages equivalent to the expense involved in performing the Schedule \u201cA\u201d work which S contracted to perform and deliberately failed to carry out. The contention that DV was only entitled to receive, by way of damages, the difference between the value of the premises if the work had been performed, and their value with the work unperformed, and that there was no evidence to establish any damage upon this basis, was not, in the circumstances of this case, a proper test for ascertaining damages.\nIt was pointless to suggest that a comparison be made between the value of the mining property with and without the work being done. The result of the Schedule \u201cA\u201d work was unknown, and it was unknown because S elected to breach the contract for its performance. But when S, by entering the agreement, acknowledged that, in the light of its future potential benefits under the agreement, its own suggested program of work was worth the cost of performing it, and when DV was prepared to give, and did give, valuable consideration for its performance, it was entirely proper for the trial judge to assess the damage resulting from the breach as being equivalent to the cost of doing the work.\nThe right to receive damages, determined in this manner, was not affected by DV having entered into an agreement with another company for the development of the mining property, which agreement did not become effective until after DV had asserted its right to damages against S, and after that action had been tried.

Appeal dismissed.\nW.J. Wallace, Q.C., and Jurgen Law, for the defendants, appellants.\nJohn L. Farris, Q.C., and George S. Cumming, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.\u2014This appeal is in an action for damages for breach of contract brought by the respondent against the appellants. The breach is admitted and the sole issue before the Court is as to the measure of damages.\nThe respondent, hereinafter referred to as \u201cDolly Varden\u201d, entered into an agreement made on March 4, 1964, and dated, for reference, February 1, 1964, with the appellant, Sunshine Exploration Ltd., an Alberta company, registered, in British Columbia. This company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sunshine Mining Company, incorporated in the State of Idaho, which could not be registered in British Columbia as its name was similar to another company, already registered in that province. Because of this, the agreement was made by the subsidiary company, but the parent company agreed with Dolly Varden and with the subsidiary that the subsidiary was an agent of the parent to perform the mining operations required under the agreement and that the parent should be liable to Dolly Varden as though it had executed the agreement.\nFor the purposes of this appeal, the legal situation of both appellants is the same and I will refer to them both, jointly, as \u201cSunshine\u201d as though they constituted, together, one party to the agreement.\nBy the terms of the agreement, Dolly Varden, which is the owner of certain mining properties in British Columbia, described in the agreement, granted to Sunshine an exclusive right, at Sunshine\u2019s expense, to explore and develop those properties. The agreement contemplated four stages of development. The first was exploratory, to enable Sunshine to determine what mining operations it was prepared to conduct during later stages. The second stage involved further exploration and was to continue until commercial production was obtained. The third stage was a period for the recovery, out of production, of the respective investments of the parties. The fourth stage was defined as \u201cthe remaining life of the agreement\u201d (for a maximum of 50 years) during which the parties would share equally any profits realized from production.\nSunshine was given the right to elect whether or not it would proceed from the first to the second stage, and, as matters turned out, it never did so proceed.\nDolly Varden agreed, on the closing date, to assign and convey to Sunshine one half of its interest in the mining properties described in the agreement. Sunshine agreed to deposit with an escrow agent documents to evidence a complete reconveyance of the half interest to Dolly Varden, which were to be delivered to that company if Sunshine terminated the agreement or failed to give notice of its intention to proceed to the second development stage. In the event, these documents were so delivered.\nThe first development period was defined as follows:\nThe First Stage or the First Development Period shall mean the period commencing from the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 1964 unless extended by written notice given by the Operator (Sunshine) to the Company (Dolly Varden) before November 30, 1964 whereupon the First Development Period shall end on June 30, 1965. Regarding the first stage of development, Sunshine covenanted as follows:\n6. The Operator covenants with the Company that:\n6.01 Forthwith after the Closing Date it will enter upon the Mining Property and undertake the development program which is generally described in Schedule F hereto (herein referred to as \u201cthe development program\u201d) provided that in any event the Operator shall be free during the First Development Period to accelerate, retard or vary such program as it progresses.\n6.02 Notwithstanding any termination provision herein contained the Operator will expend in the development program as set out in Schedule F hereto during the period ending December 31, 1964 not less than $250,000 and will maintain the Mining Property during the First Development Period, reasonable wear and tear and loss by fire and the elements excepted.\n6.03 If the Operator shall have notified the Company of its intention to extend the First Development Period to June 30, 1965 it shall thereupon be obligated to expend in development in each quarterly period or any part thereof between January 1, 1965 and June 30, 1965 not less than $60,000 which shall include the maintenance of the Mining Property during such extension period.\nSunshine also agreed to consult with an officer of Dolly Varden on all phases of the development program; to give him progress reports at least monthly; and to give him reports, on request, as to the results of drilling, sampling and other engineering data. Sunshine was required to maintain complete records and sufficient surveys, assays, maps and logs so that Dolly Varden would be fully informed as to the nature and character of the mine workings and the operations performed.\nBetween March and October, 1964, exploration work was done and Sunshine expended some $348,000. However, this work was not done to the satisfaction of Dolly Varden, which complained that it was not being provided with proper reports of expenditures and on work done, and that Sunshine had changed materially the emphasis of the drilling program.\nOn November 30, 1964, Dolly Varden received notice that Sunshine proposed to enter the second development period. On January 14, 1965, Dolly Varden gave notice of default to Sunshine, specifying a large number of points in respect of which defaults under the agreement were alleged.\nThereafter, there were various meetings between the directors of Dolly Varden and of Sunshine, as a result of which, finally, an amending agreement was executed, dated, formally, January 22, 1965. Under the provisions of this latter agreement:\n1. Sunshine withdrew and cancelled its notice of intention to enter the second period of development.\n2. Dolly Varden withdrew its notice of default and excused Sunshine from any further work on the program described in Schedule \u201cF\u201d to the principal agreement.\n3. The first development period was extended to September 30, 1965, with Sunshine having the right, by giving notice before August 31, 1965, to extend it further to December 31, 1966.\n4. Sunshine further covenanted as follows:\nNotwithstanding any termination provision herein contained, the Operator, during the remainder of the First Development Period but prior to October 1, 1965, will perform the work outlined in Schedule \u201cA\u201d to this Agreement. Once the Operator commences the work outlined in Schedule \u201cA\u201d hereto, it will proced therewith continuously and at no time during the performance of the work outlined in Schedule \u201cA\u201d hereto will the properties be left with no exploration or development work in progress. In the event that the work outlined in Schedule \u201cA\u201d hereto shall not be completed prior to October 1, 1965, the Company shall have the right to terminate the Principal Agreement by giving notice in writing of such termination to the Operator and upon the Company giving such notice the Principal Agreement shall thereupon be at an end subject however to the Operator\u2019s continuing obligations with respect to termination as provided in Clause 15 of the Principal Agreement. Provided however, that such termination shall not relieve the Operator from the obligations to complete the work outlined in Schedule \u201cA\u201d.\n5. The provisions of the principal agreement, subject to the amendments made by the amending agreement, were confirmed.\nSchedule \u201cA\u201d to the amending agreement called for the undertaking of an agreed program of diamond drilling and unwatering of the Torbrit mine (one of the mining properties described in the principal agreement); the testing of the downward plunge of the Torbrit ore body; testing by diamand drilling of the width of mineralization in the east end of the Torbrit mine; completion of approximately 5,000 feet of diamond drilling on the Wolf property (another of the mining properties covered by the principal agreement); and completion of approximately 500 feet of diamond drilling on the Sussex claims (another mining property covered by the principal agreement).\nAlthough some preparatory organizational work was done to implement the amending agreement, nothing was done by Sunshine on the ground to carry out the work called for by Schedule \u201cA\u201d. Sunshine shut down the operation.\nUnder the provisions of the principal agreement, as amended, the first development period expired on September 30, 1965, unless extended by Sunshine by notice given prior to August 31, 1965, or unless, prior to that date, Sunshine gave notice of intention to enter upon the second development period. No notice of extension was given, nor did Sunshine give notice of intention to undertake the second development period.\nIt is admitted, in the argument in this Court, that the agreement came to an end, and that Sunshine was in breach of its contractual obligation to carry out the work prescribed in Schedule \u201cA\u201d which it had agreed to perform.\nDolly Varden commenced action against Sunshine for damages for breach of the agreement. The action was tried between January 30 and February 17, 1967, inclusive. Following the hearing, further documents were filed and argument submitted respecting the consequences of an agreement which took effect on March 9, 1967, between Dolly Varden and Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited (hereinafter referred to as \u201cNewmont\u201d).\nBriefly, this agreement provided that Dolly Varden would give to Newmont exclusive possession, management and control of the mining properties of Dolly Varden, so as to conduct drilling, exploration and development work thereon. Newmont agreed to conduct a geological survey of the property, in such manner as it decided, and a geophysical survey of such portion of the property as it considered advisable. These surveys were to be completed by December 31, 1967. If this work were completed, as provided, Newmont had the right to terminate the agreement, or to extend its rights for a year, in which event it would be committed to expend not less than $200,000 on or for the benefit of the property. Two further periods of extension, for one year, were similarly provided for, at the option of Newmont, involving expenditure in each year of not less than $300,000. Thereafter Newmont had the right, either to terminate the agreement or to equip the property for mining, in which event it would acquire title to the property, for the joint venture. Profits of operation would be divided equally after reimbursement to the parties of their respective expenditures. There was no covenant by Newmont to do the work described in Schedule \u201cA\u201d to the amending agreement with Sunshine.\nThe learned trial judge gave judgment for damages for breach of contract, the award for non\u2011performance of the Schedule \u201cA\u201d work being $314,051 based on evidence as to the cost of performing such work.\nSunshine\u2019s appeal from this judgment was dismissed, unanimously, by the Court of Appeal[2], and a cross-appeal by Dolly Varden seeking an increase in this award was allowed, the damages being increased by $64,976.\nThe appeal to this Court is based solely on the issue of the measure of damages, it being contended that Dolly Varden had neither proved nor suffered any damage by reason of the non-performance of the Schedule \u201cA\u201d work. It was submitted that it was an error in law to award an amount equivalent to the cost of performance of that work. The learned trial judge found, as a fact, that:\nI am of the opinion that the completion of the Schedule \u201cA\u201d work was a necessary and economic step in the development of the Torbrit mine.\nIn the light of this finding and his finding that the officers of Dolly Varden intended the completion of the Schedule \u201cA\u201d work, the learned trial judge held that the damages should be assessed upon the same basis as was approved by this Court in the case of Cunningham v. Insinger[3]. In that case a mine owner gave to a mine operator an option to purchase a mine for a cash amount, payable in instalments. When the first instalment fell due, the operator negotiated for an extension of time. This extension was granted by the owner in consideration of the operator agreeing to do certain development work not mentioned in the option, consisting mainly of the driving of certain tunnels. The operator failed to pay, relinquished possession of the mine, and surrendered the option without having done the work. The owner sued for damages in the amount of the cost of this work. This Court decided that he was entitled to recover this amount. Idington J. dissented. Counsel for the operator, Mr. Lafleur, contended that the owner was only entitled to recover the pecuniary advantage he would have obtained by performance of the contract, which, in this case, would be the equivalent of any increase in the value of the mine arising therefrom.\nDuff J. (as he then was) said, at p. 14:\nIt would be inadvisable, I think, to attempt to lay down any general rule for ascertaining the damages to which a mine-owner is entitled for breach of a covenant to perform development work or exploratory work by a person holding an option of purchase. Cases may no doubt arise in which the test suggested by Mr. Lafleur\u2019s argument would be the only proper test, and difficult and intricate as the inquiry might be, it would be the duty of the court to enter upon an examination of the effect of doing the work upon the value of the property. On the other hand, cases must arise in which the plaintiff\u2019s right is plainly to recover at least the cost of doing the work. If it were conclusively made out, for example, that the work to be done formed part and a necessary part of some plan of exploration or development requisite, from the miner\u2019s point of view, for developing the property as a working mine, and necessary, from the point of view of businesslike management, so that it might fairly be presumed that in the event of the option lapsing the owner would in the ordinary course have the work completed, then the damages arising in the ordinary course would include the cost of doing the work and would accordingly be recoverable under the rule.\nAnglin J. (as he then was) said, at p. 16:\nActing on the advice of Mr. M.S. Davys, a mining engineer, the plaintiff insisted on the promise by Cunningham to undertake and prosecute this work immediately and continuously as the basis of any extension to be given him. Davys deposes that he and Mr. Moore had agreed that the work in question should be done. The plaintiff relied upon Davys, and it is a fair inference not only that he regards the work as essential but that it is work which he will have done. It is probably necessary to reach that conclusion in order to justify the departure made by the trial judge from the ordinary rule that the measure of damages for breach by a defendant of a contract to perform work on the plaintiff\u2019s land is the actual pecuniary loss sustained by the plaintiff as a result of such breach, i.e., the difference between what would have been the value of the premises had the work contracted for been done and their value with it unperformed. The question is by no means free from difficulty and, as presently advised, it is only because I think the learned trial judge must have dealt with it on the footing indicated and because his having done so was warranted by the evidence that I accept the measure of damages as determined.\nReference may be had to Pell v. Shearman, (1855) 10 Ex. 766; Mayne on Damages (9 ed.), pp. 237-8; Sedgwick on Damages (9 ed.), s. 619; Wigsell v. School for Indigent Blind, (1882) 8 Q.B.D. 357; Joyner v. Weeks, [1891] 2 Q.B. 31, 37-8. In the last cited case the Court of Appeal treated the breach of a tenant\u2019s covenant to yield up premises in good repair as subject to a convenient rule of inveterate practice ordinarily applicable specially to such cases and tantamount to a rule of law that the measure of the lessor\u2019s damages should be the cost of making the omitted repairs. A recent decision of an Appellate Divisional Court in Ontario may also be adverted to, M.J. O\u2019Brien Ltd. v. Freedman, (1923) 25 O.W.N. 240.\nMignault J. said, at p. 17:\nIn my opinion, on the construction of the agreement entered into by the parties, by their letters of October 19, October 26, and November 2, 1918, the carrying on of the development work mentioned in paragraph three of the appellant\u2019s letter of October 19, was the consideration of the extension of time granted by the respondent for the payment of the balance of the first instalment under the option contract between the parties. It was in no wise a condition of the original option to be unenforceable in case the option to purchase was not exercised by the appellant. On the contrary, the only possible interest the respondent could have in view when he stipulated for this development work, was in case the appellant relinquished his option. If he purchased the property, and paid for it, it would be a matter of indifference to the respondent what development work had been done. Moreover, the letter stated that the work should begin immediately.\nCounsel for Sunshine contends that the learned trial juge should have applied the decision of this Court in Cotter v. General Petroleums Limited et al.[4], and should have awarded only nominal damages.\nIn that case, Cotter bad granted to General Petroleums Limited and Superior Oils, Limited an option on petroleum and natural gas in certain lands held under lease by Cotter. Clause 2 of the agreement provided for the exercise of the option within a stipulated period by commencing the drilling of a well upon the lands described and by notifying Cotter of the exercise of the option. Under clause 3 of the agreement, the companies covenanted to exercise the option within the period prescribed in clause 2. It was provided that on their failure to do so, Cotter, notwithstanding the lapse of the option, could be entitled to exercise any legal remedies available for breach of the covenant, which, the parties agreed, was given as the substantial consideration for the granting of the option. The companies did not fulfil their covenant, and Cotter sued them for damages. At trial he was awarded an amount equivalent to the cost of drilling a well. On appeal, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta found that clause 3 of the agreement was void for repugnancy and must be rejected as destructive of the object of the instrument, a view which was shared by Locke J. in this Court.\nRinfret C.J. and Kerwin J. (as he then was), while disagreeing with this conclusion, held that there was no covenant by the companies to drill a well. Kerwin J., who wrote the reasons, said at p. 159:\nThe allowance by the trial judge was made on the basis of reading together the head lease, the agreement in question, and the form of lease attached thereto and construing the covenant sued upon as one to dig a well. I am unable to agree that this is the proper way of approaching the matter. Clause 4 of the agreement provides that the optionor shall grant to the optionees the sublease \u201cin the event of the exercise of the said option\u201d and I cannot read the document as equivalent to a simple agreement for a lease. Such a result could follow only if the option had in fact been exercised. It appears to me that clause 3 was drawn having in mind that the option might not be exercised and provided that, if the optionees neglected or failed to exercise it, certain results should follow. It was only if the option was exercised that the lease was to be entered into.\nNotwithstanding that the appellant\u2019s case was put as if the respondents\u2019 covenant was to dig a well, which as I have indicated is not in my view its proper construction, the appellant is entitled to more than nominal damages.\nIn the present case there was a specific agreement to perform the Schedule \u201cA\u201d work and a clear breach of that undertaking.\nCartwright J. (as he then was), with whose reasons Fauteux J. concurred, held that clauses 2 and 3 were not repugnant to each other, and further held that the companies had covenanted to drill a well. He said, at p. 172:\nI think that, read as a whole, the agreement of April 21, 1948 with its schedules discloses the inten- tion of the parties to agree that on or before August 1, 1948 the respondents would commence to drill a well in the manner set out in paragraph 2 of the agreement, that forthwith on such commencement the parties would execute the sub-lease and that the respondents would carry on the drilling of the well to completion in the manner set out in the sub-lease. I think that the respondents were bound in contract not only to commence but to complete the drilling of the well within the time and in the manner prescribed, and that such obligations bound them from the moment that the agreement of April 21, 1948 was executed.\nHe then went on to hold that Cotter was not entitled, in the circumstances of the case, for breach of the covenant to drill a well, to recover the expense of such drilling. His reasoning is as follows (at p. 174):\nIt remains to be considered on what principle and at what amount the damages should be assessed.\nThe underlying principle is expressed by Lord Atkinson in Wertheim v. Chicoutimi Pulp Co., [1911] A.C. 301 at 307: \u201cAnd it is the general intention of the law that, in giving damages for breach of contract, the party complaining should, so far as it can be done by money, be placed in the same position as he would have been in if the contract had been performed\u2026 That is a ruling principle. It is a just principle.\u201d In the case at bar if the respondents had carried out the contract the appellant would not have had to pay the $1,000 for a six months\u2019 extension which he did in fact pay to the head-lessor. The circumstances as to the necessity of making such payment were known to the parties and I agree with the learned trial judge that that sum is recoverable. What further benefits would have resulted to the appellant from the performance of the contract? If the respondents had drilled the well to the prescribed depth and it had proved a producer, the appellant would have received, (a) his share of the proceeds and, (b) the benefit of having the head lease validated, by the performance of the lessee\u2019s covenant to drill, not only as to the 80 acres described in the sublease but as to the whole 160 acres described in the head lease. If on the other hand, as, from the evidence of the geologists, would seem much more probable, the well had proved a failure the appellant would not have received benefit (a) but would have received benefit (b). It must be remembered however that as a result of the respondents\u2019 breach the appellant holds the whole 160 acres free from any claim of the respondents. No part of the consideration which under the contract would have passed to the respondents has passed, except that from April 21, 1948 until some time in June 1948, when they repudiated the agreement, the respondents had rights in the 80 acres and the appellant was not free to deal therewith. Under these circumstances, I do not think that the cost of drilling is the proper measure of damages. Suppose that instead of the consideration set out in the contract the appellant had agreed to pay the respondents $53,500 to drill the well and the respondents had repudiated the contract before the date set for the commencement of the work and before any moneys had been paid to them. In such a case by analogy to the rule in the case of building contracts the measure of damages would seem to be the difference (if any) between the price of the work agreed upon and the cost to which the appellant was actually put in its completion. I think it will be found that those cases in which it has been held that the cost of drilling is the proper measure of damages, are cases where the consideration to be given for the drilling had actually passed to the defendant. Examples of such cases are Cunningham v. Insinger, [1924] S.C.R. 8, and Pell v. Shearman, (1855) 10 Ex. 766 (a contract to sink a shaft).\nIt will be noted, from the passages above cited, that the obligation of the companies to drill a well (as distinct from commencing to drill a well) would arise only if the option had been exercised and they had been granted a sublease. The consideration for the drilling was to be the granting of the sublease and that consideration had not passed to them. In the present case, the consideration for the undertaking of the Schedule \u201cA\u201d work had been received by Sunshine in full. Sunshine had received, under the principal agreement, the transfer to it of a one-half interest in the mining properties. Under the amending agreement, it had received from Dolly Varden the consideration stipulated in that agreement, namely, withdrawal of the notice of default, waiver of the performance of further work under Schedule \u201cF\u201d of the principal agreement, waiver of any prior defaults, and an extension of the term of the first development period. For that consideration Sunshine had given a firm commitment to perform the Schedule \u201cA\u201d work, which it failed and refused to perform. For these reasons, I do not consider that the reasoning in the Cotter case is of assistance to Sunshine in the present appeal.\nDavey C.J.B.C., in the Court of Appeal, agreed with the judgment at trial that Dolly Varden was entitled to receive the expense involved in performing the Schedule \u201cA\u201d work. He reached this conclusion for reasons somewhat different from those of the learned trial judge. He points out that the view of Duff J., in the Cunningham case, as to the inadvisability of attempting to lay down a general rule of law for ascertaining the damages sustained by a mine owner for breach of a covenant to perform exploratory or development work is supported by high authority, and he cites the following statements of the law:\nIn Wertheim v. Chicoutimi Pulp Company, [1911] A.C. 301, which was cited in Cunningham v. Insinger, and Cotter v. General Petroleums Ltd. et al., Lord Atkinson stated at p. 307:\nAnd it is the general intention of the law that, in giving damages for breach of contract, the party complaining should, so far as it can be done by money, be placed in the same position as he would have been in if the contract had been performed: Irvine v. Midland Ry. Co. (Ireland), (1880) 6 L.R.Ir. at p. 63, approved of by Palles C.B. in Hamilton v. Magill, (1883) 12 L.R.Ir. at p. 202. That is a ruling principle. It is a just principle. The rule which prescribes as a measure of damages the difference in market prices at the respective times above mentioned is merely designed to apply this principle and, as stated in one of the American cases cited, it generally secures a complete indemnity to the purchaser. But it is intended to secure only an indemnity. The market value is taken because it is presumed to be the true value of the goods to the purchaser. In the case of non-delivery, where the purchaser does not get the goods he purchased, it is assumed that these would be worth to him, if he had them, what they would fetch in the open market; and that, if he wanted to get others in their stead, he could obtain them in that market at that price. In British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company Limited v. Underground Electric Railways Company of London, Limited, [1912] A.C. 673, Lord Haldane at pp. 688-9 stated:\nIn order to come to a conclusion on the question as to damages thus raised, it is essential to bear in mind certain propositions which I think are well established. In some of the cases there are expressions as to the principles governing the measure of general damages which at first sight seem difficult to harmonize. The apparent discrepancies are, however, mainly due to the varying nature of the particular questions submitted for decision. The quantum of damage is a question of fact, and the only guidance the law can give is to lay down general principles which afford at times but scanty assistance in dealing with particular cases. The judges who give guidance to juries in these cases have necessarily to look at their special character, and to mould, for the purposes of different kinds of claim, the expression of the general principles which apply to them, and this is apt to give rise to an appearance of ambiguity.\nSubject to these observations I think that there are certain broad principles which are quite well settled. The first is that, as far as possible, he who has proved a breach of a bargain to supply what he contracted to get is to be placed, as far as money can do it, in as good a situation as if the contract had been performed.\nThe fundamental basis is thus compensation for pecuniary loss naturally flowing from the breach;\u2026\nIn Monarch Steamship Co., Limited v. Karlshamns Oljefabriker A\/B, [1949] A.C. 196, the House of Lords followed the principle applied in Wertheim v. Chicoutimi Pulp Company, and by Duff J., in Cunningham v. Insinger, which is founded upon Hadley v. Baxendale, (1854), 9 Ex. 341. At pp. 222-3 Lord Wright repeated the passage from Lord Haldane\u2019s speech which I have quoted above.\nThe following passage from the speech of Lord Du Parcq at p. 232 puts the particular rules for measuring damages in their proper light, as simply methods of solving what is after all essentially a question of fact, and that this application must vary according to the circumstances of each case:\nI do not doubt the wisdom of the judges who, in Hadley v. Baxendale and the many later cases which interpreted or explained that classic decision, have laid down rules or principles for the guidance of those whose duty it is, as judges or jurymen, to assess damages. When those rules or principles are applied, however, it is essential to remember what my noble and learned friend Lord Wright, and Lord Haldane in the passage cited by him, have emphasized, that in the end what has to be decided is a question of fact, and therefore a question proper for a jury. Circumstances are so infinitely various that, however carefully general rules are framed, they must be construed with some liberality, and not too rigidly applied. It was necessary to lay down principles lest juries should be persuaded to do injustice by imposing an undue, or perhaps an inadequate, liability on a defendant. The court must be careful, however, to see that the principles laid down are never so narrowly interpreted as to prevent a jury, or judge of fact, from doing justice between the parties. So to use them would be to misuse them.\nApplying these principles, Davey C.J.B.C. reaches the following conclusions:\nSo in the result the appellants have received from the respondent everything they bargained for under the principal and amending agreement as the consideration for their contract to do the work specified in Schedule \u201cF\u201d as modified by Schedule \u201cA\u201d, but have done nothing they agreed to do under Schedule \u201cA\u201d. The respondent has been denied the information it would have got if the work had been done under Schedule \u201cA\u201d, for which it had paid by fulfilling all its obligations under the principal and amending agreements.\nIf appellant had performed its obligations respondent would have received valuable information about the Torbrit property. True the information might have shown the property to be of great value, or valueless, but even in the latter case the information would have been valuable to the respondent to enable it to adopt a realistic policy, and save expense of carrying worthless claims. It seems quite clear that the direct and natural consequences of the appellant\u2019s default was to deprive the respondent of essential information about the value of its properties for which it had paid. The measure of that loss is the value of the information that respondent would have obtained from the performance by appellant of its contract to do the drilling. The value of that information cannot be determined by what it would have disclosed, for that is not known, but by what it would cost the respondent to obtain it, following the analogy of determining the value to the purchaser of goods bought but not delivered by the cost of replacing them: Wertheim v. Chicoutimi Pulp Company quoted supra.\nThe reasons of Branca J.A. for supporting the judgment at trial are substantially similar to those of the Chief Justice. Nemetz J.A. agreed with the learned trial judge that, on its facts, this case was similar to the Cunningham case and that the same measure of damages ought to be applied.\nThe submissions made on behalf of Sunshine in this Court have failed to persuade me that, in the circumstances of the case, the Courts below were in error in awarding to Dolly Varden damages equivalent to the expense involved in performing the Schedule \u201cA\u201d work which Sunshine contracted to perform and deliberately failed to carry out. As stated by Lord Du Parcq in the passage cited earlier, what has to be decided, in determining damages, is a question of fact, and the Cunningham case certainly establishes that there is no rule of law which precludes the application of the method of assessing damages which was adopted by the learned trial judge in this case, when the Court considers it to be appropriate. For the reason already stated, I do not think that the Cotter case is of any assistance to Sunshine in this appeal.\nIt was contended, for Sunshine, that Dolly Varden was only entitled to receive, by way of damages, the difference between the value of the premises if the work had been performed, and their value with the work unperformed, and that there was no evidence to establish any damage upon this basis. In the circumstances of this case I do not think that this was a proper test for ascertaining damages.\nCounsel for Sunshine, in this connection, relied upon two cases, Wigsell v. School for Indigent Blind[5], and James v. Hutton and J. Cook & Sons Ltd[6].\nIn the former case, a grantee of land had covenanted to construct around the land conveyed, on all sides where it abutted on the grantor\u2019s land, a seven-foot brick wall. The wall was not erected and an action was brought for damages. It appeared that the value of the adjoining land was not decreased by the non-erection of the wall to anything like the amount required to construct it.\nThe Court refused to award damages equivalent to the cost of constructing the wall.\nThis was a case of a purchaser\u2019s covenant, similar to a restrictive covenant, taken by the seller for the protection of his adjoining land, and the measure of damages in such cases is usually the diminution in value of the adjoining land resulting from non-performance. In cases of this kind, the grantor has available the remedy of specific performance, where damages would not adequately protect his rights.\nThe latter case involved a covenant by a lessee, who, under licence, made an alteration to the front of the store he had leased. The lessee undertook, on request, to restore the building to its original condition on the expiration of the lease. The lessee failed to comply with such a request by the lessor. There was no evidence that the restoration would make the premises suitable for any particular purpose or business or that the premises were adversely affected or made less valuable by reason of the new store front which replaced the old.\nThe Court held that the lessor was only entitled to recover the damage he had actually suffered, which, in this case, was merely nominal. The Court, however, expressly disclaimed that it was suggested that the plaintiff could not give evidence that he desired to use the premises for a purpose for which the new front was unsuitable. I do not regard these cases as being analogous to the circumstances of the present case. The covenant of the grantee in the Wigsell case was given for the benefit of the adjacent lands retained by the grantor. The extent to which the value of those lands was affected by breach of the covenant was not, in the circumstances of that case, determinable by reference to the cost of construction of the wall. Similarly, in the James case, the covenant given by the lessee under the licence granted to him by the lessor, was for the benefit of the reversionary interest of the lessor. In the absence of evidence that breach of the covenant affected the use to which the lands were to be put, or their value, after the expiration of the lease, the lessor was held not entitled to recover the cost of restoration of the store front to its previous condition.\nThe agreements in the present case related to a joint venture for exploration, development and production of minerals underlying the mining properties. These properties were known to have good prospects. Stage one of the principal agreement provided Sunshine with an opportunity to ascertain whether these properties offered a potential return to it sufficient to warrant a decision to proceed further into stage two. Dolly Varden\u2019s interest was in having Sunshine proceed with the various stages into commercial production, but, failing such further progress, it would obtain, pursuant to the provisions of the agreement, full information as to the work done, the results thereof and the cost involved. In a sense, although the agreement provided that it should not be construed as creating a partnership, the parties were partners in a joint venture.\nThe work described in Schedule \u201cA\u201d to the amending agreement was work which Sunshine had decided would be of advantage, after conducting a study of the Torbrit mine and on the recommendation of its chief geologist. It committed itself to do that work for the consideration given by Dolly Varden, which Sunshine received in full. Sunshine committed itself to perform that work, obviously because it considered the results of it would be of value. Dolly Varden gave the stipulated consideration be- cause, if the results were favourable, it would obtain the further development of its property, and, if Sunshine was not satisfied with the results, it would be the recipient of useful information about its property. Clearly, in this case, both parties considered that the work, contracted to be performed, would be worth the expense of doing it. This is an entirely different situation from the covenants given in the two cases mentioned, which would be of advantage only, if at all, to the grantor and the lessor respectively.\nWhen Sunshine, later, deliberately breached its contract to perform the work, what was the measure of Dolly Varden\u2019s damage? If it had paid cash for the work, it would clearly be entitled to a repayment of it, and would also have a claim in damages. The consideration was not in cash, but Sunshine, when it executed the amending agreement, considered it to be of sufficient value to warrant the expenditure necessary to perform the work.\nIt is pointless, in these circumstances, to suggest that a comparison be made between the value of the mining property with and without the work being done. The result of the Schedule \u201cA\u201d work is unknown, and it is unknown because Sunshine elected to break the contract for its performance. But when Sunshine, by entering the agreement, acknowledged that, in the light of its future potential benefits under the agreement, its own suggested program of work was worth the cost of performing it, and when Dolly Varden was prepared to give, and did give, valuable consideration for its performance, I consider that it was entirely proper for the learned trial judge to assess the damage resulting from the breach as being equivalent to the cost of doing the work. In so doing he was seeking to fulfil the underlying principle stated by Lord Atkinson in Wertheim v. Chicoutimi Pulp Co.[7], and cited by Cartwright J. in the Cotter case in the passage already quoted: And it is the general intention of the law that, in giving damages for breach of contract, the party complaining should, so far as it can be done by money, be placed in the same position as he would have been if the contract had been performed.\nHaving reached this conclusion, I must go on to consider whether the right to receive damages, determined in this manner, is affected by Dolly Varden having entered into the agreement with Newmont, which did not become effective until after Dolly Varden had asserted its right to damages against Sunshine, and after that action had been tried.\nIn this Court, counsel for Sunshine did not contend that the benefits accruing to Dolly Varden under that contract should be considered by way of mitigation of damages. His position was that no question of mitigation arises because, he said, Dolly Varden had not established any damages. I have already indicated my reasons for disagreeing with this latter assertion. His submission was that the Newmont agreement was relevant as showing that, from its effective date, Dolly Varden had abandoned any power or intention of doing the Schedule \u201cA\u201d work itself, and, on this basis, this case was not analogous to the Cunningham case.\nThe same submission was made at trial and, in respect of it, the learned trial judge made the following finding:\nHowever I have found that the work was economic and necessary as a part of the overall scheme of development of Torbrit. I also accept the evidence of the officers of the plaintiff company to the effect that they intend the completion of the Schedule \u201cA\u201d work.\nThe fact that the new agreement with Newmont does not make specific reference to the work and does not provide for its completion at once does not mean that the plaintiff does not intend to do the work or have it done or exclude the possibility that it will be done, and the work being a necessary step in the development of the mining properties the introduction of a new principal cannot justify a finding, by itself, that the work would not be done. I am not prepared to disturb this finding. Furthermore, I do not regard the Newmont agreement as having any bearing in this case. The agreement with Sunshine terminated at the end of the first development stage. Sunshine had not given notice of intent to extend that period or to enter the next development stage. It abandoned the agreement. Immediately upon the termination of the agreement, in my opinion, for the reasons already given, Dolly Varden had a valid claim in damages equivalent to the expense of doing the Schedule \u201cA\u201d work, which it asserted by action against Sunshine. On such termination Dolly Varden had the mining property on its hands, and, later, it was able to obtain the agreement with Newmont for its development. Under that contract, the work to be done by Newmont was in its discretion, subject to its commitment, if it entered the second and later stages, to expend stipulated amounts of money \u201cfor the benefit of the property.\u201d It was not obligated to perform the Schedule \u201cA\u201d work. In view of these circumstances, I do not see how this contract can affect the cause of action of Dolly Varden to recover damages equivalent to the cost of the Schedule \u201cA\u201d work, arising out of Sunshine\u2019s failure to do that work, which cause of action arose on the termination of the Sunshine agreement.\nI would dismiss this appeal, with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Bull, Housser & Tupper, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Cumming, Bird, Richard & Co., Vancouver.\n[1] (1968), 69 D.L.R.

This company was the general contractor for the construction of certain subway stations on the Bloor-Danforth subway line in Toronto. It made an assignment in bankruptcy on September 22, 1967, and abandoned the contract. The appellants are subcontractors from Anglin-Norcross and after the bankruptcy of this company, they filed claims for liens. No notices of lien or claims for lien were received by the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto or the Toronto Transit Commission before the bankruptcy. On the date of the bankruptcy, the Toronto Transit Commission had on hand\n(a) the full statutory holdback under The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, and\n(b) certain additional sums which represented the value of the work certified as complete but not yet paid for.\nNo question arises on the statutory holdback. It is completely available for the lienholders but it is not enough to pay them in full. They are claiming also against the additional sums in the hands of the Commission.\nThe Commission is asserting a right of set-off against the amount owing to the defaulting contractor over and above the statutory holdback. This right of set-off is for the admitted extra costs incurred in completing the work over and above the contract price.\nThe Master held in favour of the lien claimants. His decision was reversed in the Court of Appeal, whose formal judgment was that the Commission had a right of set-off against the amount owing to the defaulting contractor over and above the statutory holdback for the admitted extra costs incurred in completing. The matter was remitted to the Master to resettle his report in the light of this determination. From this judgment the lienholders appeal to this Court.\nThe matter was argued before the Master, the Court of Appeal and this Court on an agreed statement of facts. The statement was supplemented in this Court by agreement of counsel on the meaning of two expressions used in the agreed statement of facts. No purpose can be served by setting out the agreement and the two further admissions. The facts are plain. The question is simply this: Who has priority in claiming against this additional fund?\nI agree with the majority judgment delivered in the Court of Appeal both in its analysis of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act and the prior litigation on this question. The Court of Appeal, in reaching its decision on December 11, 1968, followed its own decision of October 15, 1968, in S.I. Guttman Ltd. v. James D. Mokry Ltd. et al.[1], where precisely the same point of law was in issue.\nThe lien is created by s. 5(1) of the Act in favour of any person who performs any work or service or supplies materials, \u201climited, however, in amount to the sum justly due to the person entitled to the lien and to the sum justly owing, except as herein provided, by the owner.\u201d\nSections 9 and 10, which are subject to the saving clause \u201csave as herein otherwise provided\u201d, contain the same limitation of liability. They read:\n9. Save as herein otherwise provided, the lien does not attach so as to make the owner liable for a greater sum than the sum payable by the owner to the contractor.\n10. Save as herein otherwise provided, where the lien is claimed by any person other than the contractor, the amount that may be claimed in respect thereof is limited to the amount owing to the contractor or subcontractor or other persons for whom the work or service has been done or the materials placed or furnished.\nSection 11(1) and (2) provides for the holdback. In this case it is 15 per cent. This is available for the lien claims in full.\nSection 11(6) provides that all payments\u2014up to 85 per cent in this particular case\u2014made in good faith by the owner to a contractor before notice in writing of the lien is given, operate as a discharge pro tanto of the lien.\nSection 11(7) deals with the application of the holdback after the expiration of the holdback period.\nSection 11(9) prevents an owner from applying the holdback against damages for non\u2011completion. It must be applied in satisfaction of the liens.\nSo far there is nothing in the Act to support the claim of the lienholders against this additional fund. The lienholders seek to support their claim under s. 12(2) of the Act, which reads:\n12. (2) Every subcontractor is entitled to enforce his lien notwithstanding the non\u2011completion or abandonment of the contract by any contractor or subcontractor under whom he claims.\nIt is urged that this rules out any claim by the owner for damages for non-completion or abandonment of the contract against the subcontractor or any priority to the subcontractor\u2019s claims for lien.\nThis section goes back to 1923. Its effect was under consideration in Freedman v. Guaranty Trust Co. of Canada[2]. This was a case where the contractor abandoned the contract and absconded. Had it not been for the enactment of what now is s. 12(2) above quoted, the subcontractor would have had no claim. The effect of the amendment is stated by Masten J.A. (at p. 203) in these words:\nIn other words, he is by this clause of the statute placed in the same position with regard to enforcement of his lien as though the work as it stood at the date of abandonment was pro tanto a legal fulfilment of the contract and as if the principal contractor was entitled to recover against the owner on a quantum meruit for the value of the work so far as completed.\nThe subcontractor, therefore, had his rights under the Act whatever they were. The owner was allowed to claim against the amount owing to the contractor the cost of completion of the building and damages for delay.\nIt is pointed out by Schroeder J.A. in the Guttman case that the authority of this decision has never been questioned, nor was it questioned in a recent decision of the Court of Appeal in Vaillancourt Lumber Co. Ltd. v. Trustees of Separate School Section No. 2, Township of Balfour et al.[3] The Vaillancourt case was correctly distinguished in the reasons of the Court of Appeal. In the Vaillancourt case the owner had received notice in writing of a lien claim by a subcontractor. After receiving this notice, it made a further payment to the contractor. This lost it the protection given by s. 11(6) of the Act:\n11. (6) All payments up to 80 per cent as fixed by subsection 1 or up to 85 per cent as fixed by subsection 2 and payments permitted as a result of the operation of subsections 3 and 4 made in good faith by an owner to a contractor, or by a contractor to a subcontractor, or by one subcontractor to another subcontractor, before notice in writing of the lien given by the person claiming the lien to the owner, contractor or subcontractor, as the case may be, operate as a discharge pro tanto of the lien.\nTherefore, there should have been available for the lien claimant not only the holdback but the additional sum paid after notice of the lien.\nThere is nothing like this in the present case. This owner made no payment after notice of the lien. It was holding an additional sum and it made its claim for non-completion confined to this additional sum. It is still entitled to the protection of s. 11(6) and cannot be compelled to bring this sum into account to make it available in addition to the holdback to the subcontract lienholder. I am content to adopt the majority reasons delivered by the Court of Appeal in the Guttman case.\nI would dismiss these appeals with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Campbell, Godfrey & Lewtas, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondents, The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto and The Toronto Transit Commission: Bassel, Sullivan, Holland & Lawson, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent, the Trustee of the Estate of Anglin-Norcross Ontario Limited, a Bankrupt: Harries, Houser, Brown, Houlden & McCallum, Toronto.\n[1] [1969] 1 O.R. 7, 1 D.L.R.

In 1958, he was named acting superintendent of the division when the superintendent resigned following public charges of grave irregularities in the administration of the division. The defendant L\u2019Allier, as Director of the department, set up a committee of enquiry. The report of the committee disclosed that serious irregularities had occurred. While the plaintiff was not directly criticized, the report indicated a serious lack of administrative capacity on his part. The defendant decided to transfer him to another division in the same department. The transfer did not involve a change in the plaintiff\u2019s job classification and no diminution in salary or pension entitlement. The plaintiff refused to accept the transfer and he was subsequently dismissed. His action claiming damages for wrongful dismissal was maintained at trial, but that judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe plaintiff was not justified in refusing to accept the transfer. By-law No. 684 of the City provides that the public works department shall be administered by the Director of public works who shall determine the respective functions and duties of the officials under his control. In the exercise of that administrative responsibility, the defendant was intitled to decide as he did that the plaintiff should be transfered to another division. It follows that when the plaintiff refused to accept the Director\u2019s decision, the City was justified in dispensing with his services.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], reversing a judgment of St-Germain J. Appeal dismissed.\nClaude Beno\u00eet, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se Cromp and Armand Pag\u00e9, Q.C., for the defendant City of Montreal.\nDollard Dansereau, Q.C., for the defendant L\u2019Allier.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nABBOTT J.\u2014On April 7, 1937, the appellant, an engineer by profession, was engaged on a temporary basis by the City of Montreal as an electrical engineer and three months later his engagement was confirmed on a permanent basis.\nOn June 1, 1956, he was given a permanent appointment as assistant\u2011engineer\u2011superintendent, of the electricity division of the City\u2019s Public Works Department. In May 1958, he was named as acting superintendent of the said division, following the resignation of the superintendent, one Rousseau. That resignation followed public charges of grave irregularities in the administration of the division, as a result of which the repondent L\u2019Allier, as Director of the Public Works Department, had set up a committee of enquiry.\nOn January 30, 1959, the committee of enquiry filed its report with the Executive Committee of the City. The report disclosed that serious irregularities had occurred in the administration of the electricity division. While Filion was not directly criticized in the report, as Tremblay C.J. has pointed out in his reasons, the report did indicate a serious lack of administrative capacity on his part, whatever his abilities as an electrical engineer may have been. After considering the report of the committee of enquiry, L\u2019Allier, as Director of the Public Works Department, decided that Filion\u2019s usefulness in the electricity division was at an end. After some hesitation, L\u2019Allier decided to transfer him to another division in the same Department\u2014the buildings division. The transfer did not involve a change in Filion\u2019s job classification as assistant-engineer-superintendent and no diminution in salary or pension entitlement.\nWhat happened after that is summarized by Tremblay C.J., in his reasons as follows:\n[TRANSLATION] L\u2019Allier assigned Filion to the buildings division. After first accepting, Filion, dissatisfied with the working conditions, changed his mind and, in the letter of March 25, 1959, quoted by Casey J., his lawyers, in his name, claimed that their client had the right to remain assistant-engineer-superintendent in the electricity division and threatened the city with legal proceedings \u201cunless Mr. Filion is reassigned to his original position\u201d.\nOn April 15, 1959, following receipt of the letter of March 25, referred to by the Chief Justice, L\u2019Allier recommended to the Executive Committee that Filion be struck from the list of employees of the city as of March 25, 1959. A resolution to that effect was adopted by the Executive Committee on April 22, 1959.\nOn July 22, 1959, appellant took the present action claiming $183,957.80 as damages for wrongful dismissal. The action was maintained in the Superior Court to the extent of $129,\u2011214.70, but that judgment was unanimously reversed by the Court of the Queen\u2019s Bench.\nIn the circumstances of this case, I do not find it necessary to discuss the nature of Filion\u2019s tenure of employment. The essential issue on this appeal is whether he was justified in refusing to accept the transfer to another division within the same Department, made by L\u2019Allier in his capacity as Director of the Department. In my opinion he was not justified.\nBy-law No. 684 of the by-laws of the City of Montreal provides that (1) the Public Works Department shall be administered by an official designated as the \u201cDirector of Public Works\u201d and (2) the Director \u201cshall determine the respective functions and duties of the officials under his control\u201d.\nIn the exercise of that administrative responsibility, and for the reasons which I have indicated, L\u2019Allier was entitled to decide as he did that the appellant should be transferred to another division. To hold otherwise would be to impose a rigidity upon the administration of the Department which would be both unjustified and unworkable. It follows that, when the appellant refused to accept the Director\u2019s decision, the City was justified in dispensing with his services.\nFor the foregoing reasons and for those of Tremblay C.J., with which I am in substantial agreement, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: G\u00e9linas, Bourque, Lalonde & Beno\u00eet, Montreal.\nSolicitors for the defendant, City of Montreal: Pag\u00e9, Mercier & Beauregard, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the defendant, L\u2019Allier: D.

Act, 1867, s. 133\u2014Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 592(1)(b)(iii). At the trial of the petitioners on an indictment for attempted murder, counsel for the accused sought to use the French language in the examination of French-speaking witnesses. The trial judge refused the request on the grounds that the two accused were English-speaking, that the jury was made up entirely of jurors speaking that language and that counsel for the accused, although French-speaking, was perfectly familiar with the English language. The conviction was upheld by the Court of Appeal. The petitioners applied for leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The application should be dismissed.\nIn view of the provisions of s. 133 of the B.N.A. Act, the refusal by the judge to accede to the request was an error on a question of law. However, no wrong or miscarriage of justice had resulted from that error. The appeal was therefore properly dismissed under the provisions of s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Code.\nAPPLICATION for leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the conviction of the petitioners. Application dismissed.\nCyrille Goulet, for the petitioners.\nLouis Carrier, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.\u2014On December 2, 1966, a jury of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench sitting in the district of Beauharnois, province of Quebec, Peter V. Shorteno J. presiding, found the petitioners guilty on two counts of an indictment for attempted murder.\nAn appeal from this conviction was dismissed on August 7, 1969, by a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal1, then composed of Casey, Taschereau, Choquette, Brossard and Salvas JJ.\nThe petitioners apply for leave to appeal from this judgment.\nWe are all of the opinion that this motion should be dismissed. We find it desirable, how- ever, to say a few words on the main point raised by the motion and which was urged in support of the appeal to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench. This is based on the following facts.\nAt the trial, counsel for the accused sought to use the French language in the examination of French-speaking witnesses. The judge refused to allow him to do so considering that the two accused were English-speaking, that they had elected to be tried by a jury made up entirely of jurors speaking that language, that such was effectively the actual composition of the jury and that, in addition, counsel for the accused, although French-speaking, was perfectly familiar with the English language.\nThere is nothing to indicate, nor has it been contended before us, that the request made by counsel for the accused was intended to obstruct the regular course of the proceedings. It should therefore be said that, in view of the provisions of s. 133 of the British North America Act, the refusal by the presiding judge to accede to the request is an error on a question of law. It may be added that, in answer to a question put on that point to counsel for the respondent at the outset of the hearing of the motion, the latter did not hesitate to concede that this was indeed an error.\nHowever, we agree with the unanimous opinion of the Court of Appeal, that no wrong or miscarriage of justice has resulted from that error or from the other grievances raised in support of the motion. It follows that the appeal was properly dismissed under the provisions of section 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code.\nThe motion for leave to appeal is dismissed.\nApplication dismissed.\nSolicitor for the petitioners: Ivan Sabourin, St-Jean.\nSolicitor for the respondent: L. Carrier, Quebec.\n[1] [1970] C.A. 227.\n",

Lassonde, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nPIGEON J.\u2014The appellants, Ace Holdings Corporation, Rojack Corporation and Ivanhoe Corporation, were the owners of a property expropriated by the respondent. Compensation having been fixed at $1,589,225 when the offer made was $669,770, costs were allowed. These were taxed by the protonotary at $16,648.75. On respondent\u2019s motion, the Superior Court revised the amount taxed by deducting the sum of $15,892.25, being fees in the amount of 1 per cent of the compensation as provided by s. 81(2) of the tariff of advocates\u2019 fees.\nThe expropriated parties and their counsel having appealed from this decision to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, the latter, on May 15, 1969, delivered the following judgment:\n[TRANSLATION] THE COURT, having considered respondent\u2019s motion for dismissal of an appeal brought against the revision of a bill of costs on an expropriation;\nWhereas this is neither a final judgment nor one from which an appeal lies:\nALLOWS the said motion, DECLARES that this appeal is not allowable and DISMISSES it, with costs.\nFollowing this decision, the appellants applied for leave to appeal to this Court under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act. At the hearing, we pointed out to counsel for the appellants that, in respect of the jurisdiction of this Court, this case is identical with Clarke v. The Attorney General of Ontario et al[1] As in this case, the Court of Appeal had dismissed, upon motion, an appeal against a judgment of trial court judge concerning an application for revision of a taxation of costs amounting to more than $10,000\u2014namely $29,230.50. The appellant having inscribed an appeal in this Court as of right, the respondent moved to quash on February 17 last (1969). At the hearing of the motion this Court after a review of the authorities, especially Montreal Tramways v. Creely[2] and Wabasso Cotton Co. v. The Labour Relations Board[3], as well as Fiset v. Morin[4], reached the conclusion that the judgment of the Court of Appeal was a final judgment in a case where \u201cthe matter in controversy\u201d exceeded $10,000 and, consequently, there was a right of appeal to this Court under section 36. The decision delivered orally by the Chief Justice was as follows: We are all of opinion that the decision of the Court of Appeal that the appellant had no right to appeal to that Court without leave from the judgment of Lieff J. was a decision determining a substantive right of the appellant. If that judgment stands unreversed, the result is that the appellant must pay to the respondents $29,230.50 and therefore the amount in controversy in the appeal to this Court is more than $10,000.00. The motion to quash is dismissed with costs.\nUnder the circumstances of the present case, it appears proper, as counsel for the appellants has suggested, to treat his application for leave as a motion for an extension of the time allowed to bring the appeal and to allow it on the usual terms for such a motion.\nFor these reasons, the time allowed for bringing an appeal in this Court against the judgment delivered by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of the Province of Quebec, sitting in appeal on May 15, 1969, is extended for two weeks from the date of this judgment, the costs of the application to be against the appellants.\nSolicitors for the petitioners: Desch\u00eanes, de Grandpr\u00e9, Colas, Godin & Lapointe, Montreal\nSolicitors for the respondent: Martineau, Walker, Allison, Beaulieu, Tetley & Phelan, Montreal.\n[1] [1969] S.C.R. 953.\n[2] [1949] S.C.R. 197, [1949] 2 D.L.R. 404.\n[3] [1953] 2 S.C.R. 469, [1954] 2 D.L.R. 193.\n[4] [1945] S.C.R. 520, [1945] 3 D.L.R. 800.\n",

The contract stipulated that the price was subject to certain adjustments including \u201cthe amount of any federal or provincial sales tax imposed by law\u201d. On June 14, 1963, the exemption was repealed. The repealing legislation provided, in the case of certain fixed price contracts, for the refund of the tax which became payable by a vendor who was not permitted by his contract to add the tax to the purchase price. The respondent paid the tax under protest out of funds provided by the purchaser in accordance with the terms of a letter-agreement stating that the purchaser did not recognize any liability to pay the tax and that the respondent was to apply for a refund and remit it to the purchaser. A motion, without notice to the Department of National Revenue, was made in the Supreme Court of Ontario for an order determining the rights of the respondent and the purchaser under the contract. The judgment of that Court declared that the liability to pay the tax rested upon the respondent who then sought its recovery by petition of right. The Exchequer Court allowed the petition of right solely because it considered itself obliged to take the view \u201cthat judgments of Courts of equal or co-ordinate jurisdiction should be followed in the absence of strong reason to the contrary\u201d. The Court stated, however, that if the matter had come before it initially, it would have come to a contrary conclusion. The Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Cartwright C.J.: As between the purchaser and the respondent the Supreme Court of Ontario had jurisdiction to construe the agreement and to give a judgment binding on the parties thereto. That judgment was not a judgment in rem and was binding only upon the parties to the proceeding. If it is sought to recover money from the Crown in reliance on the refund section and a question arises as to the existence of the prescribed condition it would seem obvious that the Crown is a necessary party to the proceeding. On the true construction of the contract the respondent can recover the tax from the purchaser because the language employed contemplates a possible future tax being borne by the purchaser by way of an increased price. This Court is in no way fettered by the judgment of the Ontario Court. It follows that the respondent cannot recover the amount of the tax from the Crown.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie J.: The Supreme Court of Ontario had no jurisdiction to bind the Crown in this matter. The contract provided, in plain terms, for the passing on of the tax to the purchaser. By the terms of the repealing legislation, the tax had to be paid by the respondent. Liability for this tax was a matter entirely between the taxpayer and the Minister. The tax paid under protest could only be recovered by petition of right in the Exchequer Court under s. 18(1) (d) of the Exchequer Court Act. The problem which troubled the judge of the Exchequer Court in reality did not arise. The Exchequer Court alone had jurisdiction to make the decision untrammelled by the declaratory order made in the Ontario Court.\nPer Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ.: The judgment of the Ontario Court was pronounced without jurisdiction. The proper Court to adjudicate upon the rights of private parties under a contract is the superior Court of their province. When considering the ques- tion submitted to the Ontario Court in the light of all the relevant facts including the letter\u2011agreement under which the respondent\u2019s right to recover the tax from the purchaser was put beyond doubt and by virtue of which the respondent was really claiming the refund not for its own use but for the purchaser\u2019s benefit, the real question was not whether one of the parties was entitled to recover the tax from the other but whether one of them was entitled to recover it from the government of Canada for the benefit of the other. That matter was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court. The purchaser cannot be considered as a stranger to this litigation. It is in the same situation as any other person for whose benefit an action is instituted. It follows that this case should be decided without reference to the judgment of the Ontario Court. The Exchequer Court was correct in its opinion as to what the proper conclusion should be on that view of the matter.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Cattanach J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], allowing a petition of right. Appeal allowed.\nC.R.O. Munro, Q.C., and Derek Aylen, for the appellant.\nG.F. Henderson, Q.C., and B.A. Crane, for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014The relevant facts and the applicable statutory provisions are set out in the reasons of my brother Pigeon and do not require repetition but I wish to stress the circumstance mentioned by him that during the course of the hearing in this Court, counsel for the appellant in answer to a question from the Bench stated that it was not alleged that the proceedings before Landreville J. were taken or conducted in bad faith. There is no suggestion that any step has been taken seeking to reverse or set aside the judgement of Landreville J. and the time for appealing from it has long since expired although that time could, I suppose, even at this date, be extended by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nWhen the question was raised between Atlas Steels Company, hereinafter referred to as Atlas, and the predecessor of the present respondent as to the true construction of clause 18(a) of the Agreement of April 15, 1963, it was obvious that, by reason of the terms of s. 10 of c. 12 of the Statutes of Canada, 1963, 12 Eliz. II, quoted in the reasons of my brother Pigeon, the only persons having a substantial pecuniary interest in the answer to that question were the present appellant and Atlas. If it should be held that the respondent could add the amount of the tax to the sale price it would be paid to it by Atlas; if it were held that it could not it would be entitled to recover the amount of the tax from the appellant. Under these circumstances it is difficult to understand why that question was submitted in a proceeding to which the appellant was not a party. However we must deal with the circumstances as they exist.\nI think it clear that as between Atlas and the respondent the Supreme Court of Ontario had jurisdiction in the proceeding brought before it to construe the Agreement of April 15, 1963, and to give a judgment binding on the parties thereto. I think it equally clear that the judgment which was pronounced by Landreville J. was not a judgment in rem and was binding only upon the parties to the proceeding before him.\nIn the action in appeal the Exchequer Court[2] was faced with the same question as that which had come before Landreville J., that is whether on its true construction the contract in writing of April 15, 1963, did or did not permit the respondent to add the tax to the amount payable to it by Atlas. The question was not whether in the event that had happened the respondent could actually recover the tax from Atlas; it was solely a question of the true construction of the terms of the written contract.\nIn the action in appeal the circumstances, if they exist, (i) that the judgment of Landreville J. will prevent the respondent from recovering the tax from Atlas or (ii) that as a result of the correspondence between Atlas and the respondent recited in the reasons of my brother Pigeon the respondent can retain the moneys advanced to it by Atlas for payment of the tax, both appear to me to be irrelevant and I express no opinion as to whether or not they do exist; it would be idle to do so in a proceeding to which Atlas is not a party.\nIt was suggested in the course of the argument that if we should hold that the judgment of Landreville J. is not to be treated as decisive of the question of the true construction of the contract it would follow that an executor or administrator could not safely distribute a dutiable estate in reliance on a final judgment of a provincial court construing a testator\u2019s will or deciding on conflicting evidence who were entitled as next-of-kin of an intestate unless the provincial treasurer and the Minister of National Revenue were parties to the proceeding in which the judgment was pronounced. The question whether this submission is sound is not before us but the argument requires consideration.\nI have reached the conclusion that it should be rejected. Generally speaking, the incidence of estate tax and similar duties depends on the gross amount of the estate, the amounts passing to individual beneficiaries and their relationship to the deceased. These are questions which normally fall to be determined by the provincial courts according to the law of the province and, except in the possible case of a judgment obtained by fraud or collusion, it is difficult to suppose that the Minister charged with the responsibility of collecting the revenue would seek to do otherwise than impose the taxes applicable to the estate on its distribution according to the judgment of the Court.\nIn the case at bar, on the other hand, s. 10 of c. 12 of the Statutes of Canada, 1963, 12 Eliz. II, creates an extraordinary right in favour of a taxpayer to recover money from the Crown if a certain explicitly defined condition exists. If it is sought to recover money from the Crown in reliance on this section and a question arises as to the existence of the prescribed condition it would seem obvious that the Crown is a necessary party to the proceeding in which the question is to be determined.\nTurning to the question of the construction of the contract I agree with the reasons given by Cattanach J. for the conclusion to which he would have come had he felt himself untrammelled by the judgment of Landreville J. and particularly with the concluding sentence of the passage from his reasons quoted by my brother Pigeon:\nIt accordingly seems clear to me that the language employed contemplates a possible future tax being borne by the purchaser by way of an increased price.\nWhile Cattanach J. decided that as a matter of judicial comity he should follow the decision of Landreville J. in preference to his own opinion, it is clear that we are in no way fettered by the judgment of Landreville J. and I have already indicated my view as to the true construction of the contract of April 15, 1963.\nIt is obvious that the combined result of all the proceedings in this matter up to the present time is gravely unsatisfactory. The Supreme Court of Ontario, in a judgment that would appear to bind the respondent but does not bind Her Majesty, has construed the contract as meaning that the respondent cannot recover the tax from Atlas. This Court on appeal from the Exchequer Court, in a judgment that will bind the respondent but would appear not to bind Atlas, is construing the contract as meaning that the respondent can recover the tax from Atlas and consequently cannot obtain a refund of the tax from Her Majesty. However, these circumstances do not permit us to do otherwise than pronounce a judgment construing the contract according to its terms.\nDoubts were expressed during the argument as to whether there exists any procedure whereby the rights of all three parties concerned, the appellant, the respondent and Atlas, could have been determined in a single proceeding to which all were parties. If such a procedure is available in either the Exchequer Court or the Supreme Court of the Province it should of course have been resorted to; if no such procedure is available I venture to suggest that it should be provided by appropriate legislation.\nBefore parting with the matter I wish to make it plain that all I am actually deciding is that the respondent cannot recover the amount of the tax from the appellant; in arriving at this result it has been necessary to decide as between the appellant and the respondent that on the true construction of the contract between Atlas and the respondent the latter can recover the tax from Atlas; but Atlas is not a party to these proceedings and consequently this judgment will determine nothing as between Atlas and the respondent.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Pigeon.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.\u2014I agree with the conclusion of Pigeon J. that the Supreme Court of Ontario had no jurisdiction to bind the Crown in right of Canada in this matter.\nThe Excise Tax Act imposes the consumption or sales tax on the producer or manufacturer. When this contract was made between John Bertram and Atlas Steels the subject-matter of the contract\u2014machinery or apparatus to be used in the manufacture or production of goods\u2014was exempt from sales tax. But the contract provided, in plain terms, for the passing on of the sales tax to the purchaser. Consequently, when the exemption was repealed in 1963 this tax, by the terms of the repealing legislation, had to be paid by the manufacturer. Liability for this tax was a matter entirely between the taxpayer and the Minister of National Revenue.\nIn this case the Minister demanded payment of these taxes and they were paid under protest. They could only be recovered by petition of right in the Exchequer Court. This Court has original exclusive jurisdiction in such a matter by s. 18(1) (d) of the Exchequer Court Act, which reads:\n18. (1) The Exchequer Court also has exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\n* * *\n(d) every claim against the Crown arising under any law of Canada or any regulation made by the Governor in Council.\nNothing, therefore, turns on the failure of the manufacturer and the purchaser of the machinery to give notice to the Minister of National Revenue of their motion in the Supreme Court of Ontario to interpret the contract and determine their rights. Even if such notice had been given, the Minister could have disregarded it. If the money had not been paid, he could have taken collection proceedings under s. 50 of the Excise Tax Act, which reads:\n50. (1) All taxes or sums payable under this Act shall be recoverable at any time after the same ought to have been accounted for and paid, and all such taxes and sums shall be recoverable, and all rights of Her Majesty hereunder enforced, with full costs of suit, as a debt due to or as a right enforceable by Her Majesty, in the Exchequer Court or in any other court of competent jurisdiction.\nThe choice of the forum in these proceedings rests with the Minister. Whatever Court he happens to choose has jurisdiction, subject to appeal, to determine the whole matter, namely, whether the contract permits the adding of the tax to the amount payable to the manufacturer.\nPenalties under the Act are provided for by s. 50, subs. (2):\n50. (2) Every penalty incurred for any violation of the provisions of this Act may be sued for and recovered\n(a) in the Exchequer Court of Canada or any court of competent jurisdiction; or\n(b) by summary conviction under the provisions of the Criminal Code relating thereto.\nAgain, the choice of the forum rests with the Minister. Whatever court is chosen for the recovery of these penalties has exclusive jurisdiction, subject to appeal, to determine the whole matter.\nTherefore, the problem which troubled the judge at the Exchequer Court before whom this matter came, in reality did not arise. The Exchequer Court alone had jurisdiction to make the decision untramelled by the declaratory order made in the Supreme Court of Ontario. I would allow the appeal and dismiss the petition of right with costs here and in the Exchequer Court.\nThe judgment of Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by\nPIGEON J.\u2014Respondent by its petition of right seeks to recover the sum of $451,735.48 paid by way of sales tax upon the sale of a hot mill pursuant to a written agreement dated April 15, 1963, with a party therein described as \u201cAtlas Steels Company, a division of Rio Algom Mines Ltd.\u201d and hereinafter called \u201cAtlas\u201d.\nAt the date of the contract, the mill would have been exempt from sales tax as machinery and apparatus to be used in the manufacture or production of goods within the meaning of Schedule III of the Excise Tax Act. However, that exemption was repealed by s. 7 of c. 12 of the statutes of 1963. By virtue of s. 8 this had effect as of June 14, 1963. However, under s. 10, it was provided as follows:\n10. (1) Where any tax under Part VI of the Excise Tax Act has become payable by any person in respect of any designated goods that were, not later than December 31, 1964, sold and delivered by that person, or applied by that person to a use resulting in the property in the goods passing from that person, pursuant to a bona fide contract in writing\n(a) that provided for the sale of those goods or their application to that use for a fixed amount stated in the contract and that did not permit the adding of the tax to the amount payable to that person under the contract, and\n(b) that was signed by the parties thereto\n(i) on or before June 13, 1963,\u2026\na refund, or deduction from any of the taxes imposed by the said Act, of the tax or such part thereof as could not under the contract be added to the amount payable to that person thereunder may, where application therefor is made to the Minister of National Revenue by that person within two years from the time the goods were delivered by that person or applied by him to that use, be granted to that person. In the agreement with Atlas, under the heading \u201cPrice Adjustment\u201d, the following was stipulated in clause 18:\nThe price for the Mill shall be subject to the following adjustments:\n(a) the amount of any Federal or Provincial Sales Tax imposed by law; \u2026\nUnder date December 31, 1964, a letter-agreement executed on behalf of Atlas was addressed to and accepted by the respondent in the following terms:\nWe acknowledge receipt of your invoice dated December 31, 1964 for the instalment of $4,250,000 due today pursuant to our contract of April 15, 1963 (as amended) for the purchase of a Hot Planetary Mill. In response to the demand for payment in that invoice of a further $340,000 in respect of federal sales tax, we assert that no liability for federal sales tax arises in respect of the production machinery and apparatus purchased by us under the said contract of April 15, 1963.\nIn order to prevent penalties or penalty interest arising under The Excise Tax Act, we are enclosing our cheque to you in the amount of $340,000 as an amount equivalent to the sales tax demanded but not in recognition of any liability to pay such tax.\nThis payment is made on the following conditions and your acceptance thereof is hereby agreed to be upon the following conditions:\n1. That we make this payment under protest that no federal sales tax liability arises in respect of this sale of products or machinery pursuant to our contract of April 15, 1963;\n2. That you will remit the amount of $340,000 to The Department of National Revenue in respect of federal sales tax related to the aforesaid contract, under protest making known our protest;\n3. That it is understood and agreed that we may seek judicial interpretation of the respective rights and obligations of your company and ours in respect of federal sales tax under the said contract of April 15, 1963 as amended.\nIt is further understood and agreed that you will at our request and at our expense, originate or become a party to such proceedings at law as we may deem expedient to obtain a final judicial interpretation as to the exigibility of federal sales tax under the said contract and such further and other action as may be necessary to obtain a refund of such federal sales tax. If any such interpretation should result in the refund of any sales tax under this contract you will promptly refund to us the said sum of $340,000 or any part thereof when you shall have received the same plus any other sums which may hereafter be payable in like manner under the said contract, together with interest thereon if paid to you.\nIn accordance with that letter-agreement, respondent made in January 1965 a first sales tax payment of $340,000. A letter dated January 29, 1965, was addressed to the Department of National Revenue stating that this amount was being paid under protest, that solicitors for Atlas had been informed by the Department that the contract did not qualify for relief under s. 10 of the 1963 Act and that:\nIt is intended to seek judicial interpretation in the Ontario courts as to whether, under the terms of that contract, our company has the right to pass on to Atlas Steels Company the burden of sales taxes imposed by the amendment to the Excise Tax Act, effective June 13, 1963. If the result of such a determination should be that we have not the right to demand such payment from Atlas Steels Company, it is our intention to apply to the department for a refund of the above amount of $340,000.00, as well as any other amount similarly collected from Atlas Steels Company pursuant to the above contract.\nIn June 1965, without notice to the Department, a motion was made in the Supreme Court of Ontario by counsel for Atlas in the presence of counsel for the respondent for \u201can order declaring and determining the rights of the parties\u201d under the agreement dated April 15, 1963. The affidavit annexed to the notice of motion made reference solely to that agreement and a copy thereof appears to have been the only material submitted. On July 2, 1965, judgment was rendered by Landreville J. declaring that the liability to pay the sales tax rested upon the respondent. Reasons for judgment were delivered, the material part being as follows:\nThe contract between the parties is on file. The relevant clauses are 15, 17 and 18. \u2026 After reading the contract as a whole and more particularly the above-numbered clauses, I have come to the conclusion that the contract, while referring to the sales tax, does not specifically and clearly state who is to pay same. Due to the fact that the statute which subsequently came into existence imposes on the manufacturer the tax, it is not that clear language necessary for me to displace the obligation to the purchaser.\nI accept the argument of the applicant that the words imposed \u201cby law\u201d make reference and contemplate the tax which might be in existence at that time. I understand that the goods manufactured could have been pleaded to have been exempted from taxation at the time of contract.\nAfter that judgment respondent paid on account of sales tax and under protest further amounts as follows:\nOn July 29, 1965 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.$64,770.65\nOn April 21, 1966 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026$46,964.83\nFrom a letter written by the respondent on September 16, 1965, it appears that the July payment was made out of funds provided by Atlas. Nothing shows it was otherwise for the April payment.\nApplication for refund having been refused, a petition of right was filed on January 27, 1967. At the hearing, an agreed statement of facts was produced in which nothing of importance appears beyond the above summary.\nCattanach J. allowed the petition solely because he considered himself obliged to take the view \u201cthat judgments of courts of equal or coordinate jurisdiction should be followed in the absence of strong reason to the contrary\u201d. He indicated what \u201cstrong reason\u201d would, in his opinion, justify a departure from such a decision by quoting the following passage from McRuer C.J. in Rex. v. Northern Electric Co.[3]:\nI think that \u201cstrong reason to the contrary\u201d does not mean a strong argumentative reason appealing to the particular judge, but something that may indicate that the prior decision was given without consideration of a statute or some authority that ought to be followed. I do not think \u201cstrong reason to the contrary\u201d is to be construed according to the flexibility of the mind of the particular judge. He made it clear that his conclusion was based solely on that view of judicial comity by stating:\n\u2026 I must say that if the matter had come before me initially, untrammelled by the judgment of Landreville J., I would have come to a conclusion contrary to his. Considering the contract as a whole and what I conceive to be the fair and plain meaning of the language of paragraph 18(a) thereof, I would have concluded that the parties thereto contemplated that any federal sales tax imposed by law would be the subject matter of a price adjustment to be borne by the purchaser\u2026.\nI cannot agree with Landreville J. that \u201cthe words imposed \u2018by law\u2019 make reference and contemplate the tax which might be in existence at that time\u201d. First, because there was no federal sales tax imposed by law at that time, secondly, because the words \u201cimposed by law\u201d is the adjectival use of a participle modifying the word \u201ctax\u201d and thirdly, because of the inclusion of the word \u201cany\u201d. It accordingly seems clear to me that the language employed contemplates a possible future tax being borne by the purchaser by way of an increased price.\nIt will thus be seen that we are faced in this appeal with the unusual situation of a trial judge making a very strong and persuasive argument against the view that he finally took of the merits of the case because of what he conceived it to be his judicial obligation of comity towards another court of coordinate jurisdiction. On account of the implications of such a question, a re-hearing of this case before the full Court was directed.\nIn considering what weight should be given to Landreville J.\u2019s judgment, the first question must be whether he had jurisdiction. There can be no doubt that as a general rule the proper court to adjudicate upon the rights of private parties under a contract is the superior court of their province. It is indeed conclusively established by the decision of this Court in Consolidated Distilleries Ltd. v. Consolidated Exporters Corp Ltd.[4], that the Exchequer Court does not have general jurisdiction to entertain claims between subject and subject because in s. 101 of the B.N.A. Act \u201claws of Canada\u201d means laws within the competence of the Parliament of Canada only.\nHowever, when the facts of this case are scrutinized, it becomes apparent that the question raised by the motion in the Supreme Court of Ontario did not really concern the rights of the parties between themselves but solely their claim against the Crown in right of Canada. This is because the rights of the parties between themselves no longer stood at that time as they were after the execution of the original agreement. They had entered into another binding agreement whereby there could no longer be any dispute as to the incidence of the added sales tax burden. Under that later agreement, respondent\u2019s right to recover the sales tax from Atlas was put beyond doubt. Indeed Atlas agreed to provide the money for paying it. Because the rights of the parties were no longer governed by the original contract but by the subsequent agreement, Atlas did in July 1965, after the judgment declaring that it was not liable to pay the sales tax, provide money for paying it. It must also be noted that by virtue of the letter-agreement the respondent is really claiming the refund not for its own use but for Atlas\u2019 benefit.\nTherefore, if the question submitted to the Supreme Court of Ontario is considered in the light of all the relevant facts including those that were then left undisclosed, it becomes clear that, in view of the provision for refund in the 1963 Act, the real question was not whether one of the parties was entitled to recover the sales tax from the other but whether one of them was entitled to recover it from the Government of Canada for the benefit of the other. This was not really a dispute between subject and subject but a request for a finding on which a claim against the Crown would automatically fall to be allowed in favour of the respondent because none of the other requirements was in dispute. The making of such a finding under those circumstances was not within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Ontario by virtue of the provisions of s. 18(1)(d) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98: 18. (1) The Exchequer Court also has exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\n* * *\n(d) every claim against the Crown arising under any law of Canada or any regulation made by the Governor in Council;\nIt must be observed that notice of the motion before the Supreme Court of Ontario was not given to the Department of National Revenue. The letter of January 29, 1965, can in no way be considered as such a notice, it merely informed the Department of the intention to initiate proceedings, it did not advise of the proceedings themselves. The Department officials certainly were under no obligation to make enquiries as to the actual carrying out of the intention disclosed to them. Seeing that no notice was given, it is clear that the objection to the jurisdiction must be considered in these proceedings. This in no way implies that it would be otherwise if notice had been given and no opinion is expressed as to whether notice could or should be given of proceedings between subjects susceptible of having an influence on rights of the Crown.\nThe hearing before Landreville J. was not such a proceeding. It had only the appearance of a contest between litigants. In fact, by virtue of the letter-agreement of December 31, 1964, counsel for both parties represented the same interest: Atlas. The adverse interest, the Crown, was not represented. Even the adjudication of costs was purely illusory; due to the letter-agreement Atlas was to bear them irrespective of any order that might be made. The fact that the Department was informed of the intention to apply to the Supreme Court of Ontario for an order determining the construction of the original agreement might indicate that the parties to it believed that, in spite of their subsequent arrangement, this was the proper jurisdiction. If so, they were mistaken. At that time, the only dispute was not between the parties but with the Crown and the matter was therefore within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court.\nDuring the hearing in this Court, counsel for the appelant in answer to a question from the Bench stated that it was not alleged that the pro- ceedings before Landreville J. were taken or conducted in bad faith. I have already indicated a reason for believing that it was really done in good faith. However, it does not seem to me that this is of any help to the respondent. In order to ascertain the legal effect of an operation one must look at the substance and a Court is not prohibited by the form of the documents from ascertaining its true nature: Monarch Securities Ltd. v. Gold[5], Maas v. Pepper[6].\nApplying this principle to the application before Landreville J. no other conclusion is possible but that its true object was not a determination of the rights of the parties between themselves. The only object was a finding against the Crown in favor of Atlas, respondent being a nominal claimant and acting as an agent or trustee for its benefit.\nUnder such cirmustances, it does not seem to me that Atlas can be considered as a stranger to this litigation. It is in the same situation as any other person for whose benefit an action is instituted. In Gough v. Toronto and York Radial R.W. Co.[7], Middleton J. said in a judgment that was unanimously upheld in appeal:\nWhere the insurance company sues in the name of the assured, no doubt he is a nominal plaintiff, and in proper cases security for costs may be ordered; and also the insurance company is a person for whose benefit the action is brought, and so discovery may be had against it.\nIn Deisler v. U.S. Fidelity Co.[8], Duff J. (as he then was) said (at p. 1053):\nAdmittedly notice of assignment was not proved and therefore under the statutory law of British Columbia the assignment was not complete as a statutory assignment, that is to say, the chose in action did not, by virtue of the statute, become vested in the assignee. Treating the assignment as an equitable assignment, the absence of the assignee, the action being brought in the name of the assignor, would be no answer to the action but only a ground for aiding the assignee for the purpose of protecting the defendant; the assignor being a trustee for the assignee by virtue of the equitable assignment, the chose in action being a legal chose in action and inhering in the assignor as the legal owner of it.\nIn my opinion Atlas must be considered as the real claimant against Her Majesty and as having sought from the Supreme Court of Ontario a finding on which to base that claim. As that finding was an essential part of the process of determining whether the claim was well-founded or not, the Exchequer Court had exclusive jurisdiction over the determination of that fact as well as over all other facts on which the decision of the case in first instance depended.\nHaving come to the conclusion that the judgment of Landreville J. was pronounced without jurisdiction, it follows that this case should be decided without reference thereto. In my opinion, Cattanach J. was correct in his opinion as to what the proper conclusion should be on that view of the matter.\nFor those reasons, the appeal should be allowed and respondent\u2019s petition of right dismissed with costs in both courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D.S.

The plaintiff navigated the boat until they stopped for lunch, after which his wife took over the controls. As they approached a dam with the intention to take their boat through the lock, it became apparent that the lock was not open for use. In fact, the river was not open for navigation. The wife turned the boat about and went back up-stream with the intention of returning home. The plaintiff looked down the river, saw that all the curtains of the dam were raised. The danger signs placed on a buoy and warning of a water fall ahead were no longer in place. These signs had been placed by the Crown servants, had apparently been dislodged by flood waters and had not yet been replaced. It then appeared to the plaintiff that the water was level on both sides of the dam and he could see no falls but did observe a number of small boats fishing and cruising on the far side of the dam, from all of which he concluded that it would be safe to pass under the bridge and directed his wife to do so. When the boat was about 50 feet from the dam, the drop in the water level became clearly visible and the fall of water very audible. The boat was carried broadside over the top of the dam, filled with water and capsized. The plaintiff\u2019s wife was drowned. The plaintiff\u2019s petition of right claiming damages was dismissed by the Exchequer Court. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Abbott and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Cartwright C.J.: The failure on the part of the employees of the Crown to replace the warning signs was negligent and was an effective cause of the disaster. It was an effective cause of the plaintiff and his wife embarking on a dangerous course which they would not otherwise have entered. Their negligence in failing to realize and appreciate the existence of the danger a few moments sooner than they did does not warrant the placing of the whole blame upon them.\nPer Hall and Spence JJ.: The facts of this case justify the equal division of the negligence between the plaintiff and the Crown. The lack of proper attention and failure to keep the boat under control during the progress forward from the point of turning to the moment when, all too late they appreciated the danger, was negligence on the part of the plaintiff and of his wife. The Crown was negligent in failing to replace the warning signs which caused the plaintiff to determine to carry out what turned out to a fatal manoeuvre and which led him to believe that his wife could drive the boat forward under the bridge safely. These acts of negligence on both sides were operating simultaneously.\nPer Abbott and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: The failure of both the plaintiff and his wife to take any precautions for their own safety was the determining factor in producing the unhappy result which occurred. The absence of the warning signs on the buoy was not of itself a cause of the accident which was solely occasioned by the acts of the plaintiff and his wife. Their negligent conduct was severable from and subsequent to any negligence which might be attributed to the Crown, and in navigating their pleasure boat as they did, they ought to have anticipated the disaster which ensued.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Cattanach J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada, dismissing the appellant\u2019s petition of right. Appeal allowed, Abbott and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.\nD\u2019A. C.H. McCaffrey and J.F. O\u2019Sullivan, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nDerek H. Aylen and Robert W. Law, for the defendant, respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014The relevant facts are set out in the reasons of my brothers Ritchie and Spence which I have had the advantage of reading.\nI agree with the judgment of my brother Spence and wish to add only a few words.\nIn my opinion, there was no adequate reason or excuse for the failure on the part of the employees of the respondent to replace the warning sign reading \u201cDanger\u2014Falls Ahead\u201d, this failure was negligent and was an effective cause of the disaster that occurred. I base this conclusion on the reasons given by my brother Spence and do not find it necessary to add anything to what he has said.\nNeither my brother Ritchie nor the learned trial Judge has found it necessary to decide whether there was negligence imputable to the respondent as in their view, even if there was, the negligence of the appellant and his late wife was the sole proximate cause of the accident. I cannot accept this view. This appears to me to be a case in which the negligence for which the respondent is responsible was an effective cause of the appellant and his late wife embarking on a dangerous course which they would not otherwise have entered. I agree that they were negligent in failing to realize and appreciate the existence of the danger a few moments sooner than they did; but this does not, in my opinion, warrant the placing of the whole blame upon them. All the conduct with which they are reproached should be viewed in the light of the fact that they were acting in a situation of imminent danger into which the negligence imputed to the respondent had brought them.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Spence. The judgment of Abbott and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J. (dissenting)\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Mr. Justice Cattanach of the Exchequer Court of Canada whereby he dismissed the suppliant\u2019s claims made by Petition of Right purporting to be brought by virtue of the provisions of the Crown Liability Act, 1952-53 (Can.), c. 30 and of The Trustee Act of Manitoba, R.S.M. 1954, c. 273 and The Fatal Accidents Act of that Province, R.S.M. 1954, c. 84.\nThe Petition was filed by Egan Hendricks as the administrator of the estate of his late wife, Irene May Hendricks, claiming under The Trustee Act for his wife\u2019s funeral expenses, the loss of his boat and general damages, and under The Fatal Accidents Act on behalf of himself and his daughter for general damages occasioned by the death of his wife as the result of an accident which occurred when Mr. Hendricks\u2019 boat, then being operated by his wife, was swept over a waterfall adjacent to St. Andrew\u2019s Lock at Lockport in the Province of Manitoba on June 19, 1966.\nIt is not denied that the Lockport Dam and the St. Andrew\u2019s Lock are public works and that the Department of Public Works is responsible for their management, maintenance and control, and in this regard a Privy Council Order was issued on the 29th of December, 1949 (P.C. 6514) entitled \u201cRegulations for the use and Operation of St. Andrew\u2019s Lock, Red River, Man.\u201d In cross-examination Hendricks finally admitted that he was familiar with this Order which provides, inter alia:\n2. (g) \u2018season of navigation\u2019 means the period between the opening and closing of the lock for traffic;\u2026\n4. The lock will be open throughout each day and night during the season of navigation, unless at any particular time provision to the contrary be made by proper authority.\n17. (1) Every master or person in charge of any vessel on approaching the lock or bridge shall ascertain whether the lock or bridge is prepared to allow them to enter or pass, and stop the speed of any such vessel in sufficient time to avoid a collision with the lock or its gates, or with the bridge or other works.\nThe italics are my own.\nI think it must be accepted that the fixed weir adjacent to the lock to which reference will hereinafter be made, comes within the meaning of \u201cother works\u201d as employed in the section last quoted, and that when Mr. Hendricks\u2019 boat was swept over the waterfall created by this weir, it must be taken to have come into collision with it. I think also that the evidence makes it clear that although they were familiar with the regulations last referred to, the Hendricks acted in direct contravention of them; although they knew that the lock was dry they failed to recognize that the season of navigation had not opened and they made no effort to stop the speed of their boat in sufficient time to avoid colliding with the weir.\nMr. Hendricks and his wife were enthusiastic members of the Redboyne Boating Club, an organization composed of persons who enjoyed boating on the Red River and which supplied its members, including the Hendricks, with full information as to safe navigation and the condition of that River, together with instructions as to safe operation of small boats. The Hendricks were familiar with the River, including the dam at Lockport and the five-foot drop in the River adjacent thereto which created the waterfall where the accident occurred.\nHendricks and his wife had owned small boats for seven years and in the autumn of 1965 Hendricks had purchased a 19-foot fibre glass boat having a 7-foot beam and powered by a 90 horsepower outboard motor, in which he and his wife and a friend by the name of John Atkinson embarked at the Redboyne Boating Club dock on June 19, 1966, taking their lunch and some beer with them with the object of enjoying a cruise on the River as far as Selkirk, which was north of the Lockport Dam. Mr. Hendricks navigated the boat until they stopped for lunch, but when they started again Mrs. Hendricks took over the controls and Hendricks and his friend Atkinson seated themselves in the rear of the boat facing the stern.\nThe dam, so called, at Lockport, consists of a bridge which rests upon five substantial concrete pillars between each of which there is a metal frame with wooden slats affixed to it; the wooden slats operate more or less on the principle of a venetian blind and when the frame is lowered so as to rest upon the top of a concrete weir which is designed to receive it and when the wooden slats are closed, the flow of the River is interrupted and the dam becomes effective so as to raise the water level to allow boats to pass over the Lister Rapids and permit navigation between Lockport and Winnipeg which is a distance of approximately fifteen miles to the south. Whether the dam is lowered or not, the fixed weir has the effect by itself of causing a small waterfall of about five feet with which both the Hendricks were familiar.\nWhen the flow of the Red River at Redwood Bridge in the City of Winnipeg is estimated at 10,300 cubic feet per second, which usually occurs sometime in the early part of June, the dam curtain is lowered at Lockport, the wooden slats are closed and the lock adjacent to and directly to the west of the dam is put in operation so that river traffic can get past the dam; when this occurs the River is declared open for navigation, but in the year 1966 this did not occur until the 20th of June, and on the day of the accident the metal frames were still in the raised position and the dam had no effect on the rate of flow of the River. At the same time the ship canal leading to the lock was dry and the lock was obviously not in operation.\nIt is to be remembered that Mr. and Mrs. Hendricks must both be taken to have been aware of the rules of the River and as they approached the dam and found the curtain to be raised and the lock to be dry, they ought to have known that the River was not open to navigation.\nNotwithstanding the fact that the Hendricks had been through the lock on many occasions and had seen the falls at least six times, they appear to have concluded that the water in the River had risen to an extent which would make it safe for them to go under the open curtain of the bridge without encountering the five-foot drop in the level of the River.\nIt is necessary here to mention the fact that the employees of the Department of Public Works who were in charge of the management of the Lockport Dam had customarily placed a buoy a short distance to the south of the dam at a point in line with and slightly to the south of the eastern side of the ship canal which led into the lock. Normally there were affixed to this buoy two white wooden signs placed crosswise with the words \u201cDanger Falls Ahead\u201d painted thereon in red letters, but in the spring of the year 1966 the flood waters of the River washed over the buoy and dislodged the signs which had not been replaced on the 19th of June, 1966.\nAs they approached the dam, it was the intention of the Hendricks to take their boat through the lock, but as they got close it became apparent that the ship canal was impassable and that the lock was not open for use. The suppliant testified that at this point his wife turned the boat about and went back upstream from the dam about one-quarter of a mile with the intention of returning home, but Mr. Hendricks says that he then looked back down the River, saw that all the curtains of the dam were raised and observed that the danger signs were no longer placed on the buoy; it then appeared to him that the water was level on both sides of the dam and he could see no falls but did observe a number of small boats fishing and cruising on the far side of the dam, from all of which he concluded that it would be safe to pass under the bridge and directed his wife to do so, whereupon Mrs. Hendricks put the boat about and headed for the fourth span of the bridge, at a speed which Hendricks estimated to be between ten and twelve miles per hour. It was not until the boat was about fifty feet from the dam that the presence of the drop in the water level became clearly visible and the fall of water very audible; at this point Mrs. Hendricks turned the boat broadside to the dam and the flow of the River. The boat was then in a dangerous position and at the trial Hendricks testified that he shouted to his wife to \u201ccut it\u201d although he had previously given a statement to the effect that: \u201cThe wife tried to make a turn so I said put it in reverse. She put it in reverse and the motor kicked up\u201d. His companion, Mr. Atkinson, made a statement to the same effect. In any event, it is established that the motor became locked in a position with the propellor out of the water so that the boat was out of control, whereupon Mr. Hendricks took over from his wife and tried to get the motor down. In the result the boat was carried broadside over the top of the dam and finally filled with water and capsized as a result of which Mrs. Hendricks was drowned.\nThe suppliant alleges that his wife\u2019s death was caused by the \u201ccarelessness, recklessness and negligence of servants of Her Majesty in right of Canada\u201d and pleads that such servants were negligent in failing to close the dam before June 19, 1966; in causing a dangerous drop in water level; in failing to warn the public of the existence of this danger by adequate visible or audible warning signs; by failing to replace the warning signs which had been floated on the buoy and lost in the flood; by failing to take adequate precautions to avoid damage to pleasure boat users; by failing to have emergency assistance available; and, lastly, by creating a trap on the Red River without any warning of the existence thereof to boat users.\nBy way of defence, the Crown submits that the accident was caused solely by the negligence or alternatively, the contributory or ultimate and effective negligence of the suppliant and his deceased wife.\nIt appears to me that if there was any negligence on the respondent\u2019s part it was in failing to replace the warning signs on the buoy so as to alert persons unfamiliar with that portion of the River to the fact that there were \u201cFalls Ahead\u201d. This created a static situation which was potentially dangerous to those who did not know about the dam and the falls, but these were conditions with which both the suppliant and his wife were thoroughly familiar and the danger was not only one which they had every opportunity to avoid, but one to which they deliberately exposed themselves.\nAlthough Mr. Hendricks testified that he thought that the River had levelled out so as to make it safe for him to pass under the bridge, I do not think that this was a reasonable conclusion for any man to make who had seen the waterfalls six times before and passed through the lock on more than one occasion and whose observation of the condition of the ship canal and lock on the day of the accident should have alerted him to the fact that the River was not yet open for navigation at that point. In my opinion, the failure of both Mr. and Mrs. Hendricks to take any precautions for their own safety was the determining factor in producing the unhappy result which occurred. The absence of the warning signs on the buoy was not of itself a cause of the accident which was solely occasioned by the acts of the suppliant and his unfortunate wife. The negligent conduct of the suppliant and his wife was severable from and subsequent to any negligence which might be attributed to the respondent, and in navigating their pleasure boat as that did, it appears to me that they ought to have anticipated the disaster which ensued. This is not a case to which the provisions of the Tortfeasors and Contributory Negligence Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 266, can have any application.\nFor all these reasons I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of Cattanach J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada pronounced on May 31, 1968, whereby that learned trial judge dismissed the petition of right filed by the claimant.\nI have had the privilege of reading the reasons of Ritchie J. but with regret I must differ from his conclusion.\nIn order to avoid repetition I do not outline the facts as completely as did Ritchie J. and shall only make reference thereto where it is necessary for the purpose of these reasons.\nPrior to the year 1903, the Red River, subject to certain portages, was navigable from the City of Winnipeg to Lake Winnipeg. In that year, in order to permit navigation over the Lister Rapids, which extend from a point some five miles upstream from the St. Andrew\u2019s Dam and Locks for a distance of eight miles, by increasing the water over the rapids the federal government installed this series of works which may briefly be described as follows:\nOn the base of the river there was laid a concrete weir some 37 feet in width which at places was 20 feet above the bed of the stream, then a bridge for the use of vehicular traffic which was supported by six large concrete piers was erected immediately above the weir. There were hanging from the lower side of the platform of the bridge a series of gates. These gates were so attached that they were hinged at their top end to the underside of the bridge so that they might either be retained in a position parallel to the floor of the bridge and immediately below it or dropped to a vertical position their lower ends resting in slots along the top of the weir. The curtain which has been perhaps aptly described as a Japanese blind could be lowered so that the space between the floor of the bridge and the top of the weir was reduced. When these curtains were down the water level over the weir was raised, according to the finding made by the learned trial judge, by some fourteen feet. On the other hand, when the curtains and the gates in which they sat were raised the whole space between each of the concrete piers was opened and on the 19th of June, 1966, the day of the accident, 2.4 feet of water flowed over the top of the weir. It is, therefore, apparent that whether the gates on this dam were raised or lowered, there was beneath the water and always hidden from view a very substantial concrete barrier constituting, what Duff C.J. described in The King v. Hochelaga Shipping & Towing Company Ltd.[1], \u201ca dangerous menace to navigation.\u201d When the gates and curtains were lowered, the peril to navigation, of course, was obvious on even a casual observation as, in fact, there was a complete wall across the river. When those gates and curtains were raised the appearance was that shown in the third opening from the left on the photograph produced at trial as ex. 5, that is, it bore much the appearance of an ordinary bridge across a river. To provide for navigation past this dam, the federal government had installed on the west side of the Red River a canal channel and lock. The canal channel had been dredged and the earth from it thrown up to the east of the canal between it and the river to form an artificial island of some very considerable extent. Immediately beneath the bridge portion of the works a lock was installed. Boats coming downstream from Winnipeg passed this set of works by entering the boat channel along the west limit of the river and to the west of this artificial island, progressing down that channel to the lock and then through the lock to the uninterrupted portion of the river to the north of the set of works. This set of works was by the provisions of the Public Works Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 228, under the management, charge and direction of the Minister of Public Works, and at all material times the employees of that department were servants of the Crown acting in the course of their duties as such. This admission was made for the purpose of the trial.\nIt was the practice in the operation of the lock and dam to raise the gates and curtains in the month of November and at that time to cease the operation of the lock. In the spring, at a date which varied according to the flow in the river, the gates were lowered and the curtains closed so that the depth of water to the south, i.e., upstream of the dam, rapidly increased. The canal channel which had been dry during the low water filled up and the lock went into operation. In order to indicate the turn from the main channel course for boats coming downstream into the canal, the Crown servants had placed in the river, a little south of the south end of the artificial island and some distance into the stream, a buoy which was described as a 6-foot floating buoy. This buoy consisted of an anchor of 400-pound weight holding a floating platform from which protruded a circular pipe-like projection painted black.\nIn 1964, the canal superintendent testified, that noticing that the occupants of small boats were subjecting themselves to a very considerable hazard by operating their boats back and forth in the fore bay just above the dam, he caused to be placed on the top of this buoy a mast and by wood screws attached to the mast two signs. These signs were at right angles; both were about 3 feet long by a foot high and both bore the same inscription \u201cDanger\u2014Falls Ahead\u201d.\nIn the year 1966, that buoy with the signs so affixed and painted was placed in the river on the 13th of May. On such date, the lock had not yet been put into operation. The gates with their shutters had not been lowered, as the river had not yet come to flood. Through long experience it had been discovered that it was not appropriate or efficient to close those gates and shutters until the flow of water past Redwood Bridge in the City of Winnipeg, some 15 to 18 miles upstream from this St. Andrew\u2019s Lock, had decreased to 10,300 cu. ft. per second. When the river was in flood following the 13th of May, the height of the water rose so considerably that the buoy platform, being attached to its 400 pound anchor by a chain, was submerged and with the platform the buoy itself and its attached mast and signs also went under.\nIn all probability, it was this rush of water which detached the signs. The first sign was detached during the month of May and early in the week of the 6th of June 1966, the superintendent noted that the second sign had disappeared from the mast above the buoy. The buoy had been put in place by using a work boat some 19 feet in length, and that work boat was then returned to the lock and left inside the lock for security. Following the time when the first sign disappeared, the superintendent was unwilling to take the work boat out of the lock and venture into the stream for the purpose of replacing the first missing sign because the current at flood time was so strong that it would have endangered the lives of his staff. After he had noticed during the few days immediately following the 6th of June that the second sign was missing, it would have been possible, by the use of that work boat, to have replaced the signs, but the lowered water had caused the canal channel to dry out and the work boat was blocked in the lock so that it was not available. In addition, it was expected by the Crown servants that the flow in the river would decrease to the point where it would become appropriate to lower the gates and curtains. That action would, of course, have increased the depth of the water above the dam, and would therefore have flooded the canal channel so that the work boat could have been used.\nThe date for the lowering of the gates and curtains was successively postponed on several occasions because of surges in the flood tide and, in fact, they were not lowered until the 20th of June, the day immediately following the fatal accident with which this petition is concerned.\nI shall hereafter deal with the conduct of the suppliant Egan Hendricks but it is my intention to first deal with the allegation that the Crown was liable because of the negligence of Crown servants. There is no doubt that this concrete weir across the navigable channel did create a dangerous menace to navigation. The Crown servants realized that danger and had placed on the buoy which indicated the turn into the canal channel the signs warning of the falls ahead. The Crown servants in doing so were, in my opinion, carrying out their proper duty to warn against the danger to navigation which the Crown itself had created. The Crown servants noticing the disappearance of those signs had failed to replace them. So long as the river was in heavy flood, I am of the opinion that that failure may be excused for two reasons, firstly, that advanced by the superintendent that to attempt to launch a boat into the river would have endangered the lives of the Crown workmen who would be the crew of that boat and, secondly, that the river in such flood there could be no boat traffic to warn. But the situation after the 6th of June 1966, in my opinion, differed materially. At that time, the superintendent admitted that it would have been quite feasible to have replaced the warning signs had he a boat available; and he admitted further that the boat need not have been a very large boat but one of the size of their own work boat or of the size of that of the suppliant Egan Hendricks which went over the dam would have been sufficient. Surely the use of such a boat could have been arranged with a minimum of effort. The Crown servants\u2019 own work boat sat in the lock. It was only of the size of the suppliant\u2019s boat and, although the lock channel was dry, it could easily have been hauled over the berm and launched into the stream. There were in the immediate area other boats with outboard motors of up to 20 mph. and the use of one of those could have been obtained, or the department could have obtained a boat any place between St. Andrew\u2019s Lock and Winnipeg, head out down the stream as did the suppliant and go alongside the buoy to affix the signs. The circumstances to which I shall refer hereafter, and which resulted in the fatal accident to the late Mrs. Hendricks, illustrated the importance of replacing those warning signs on the buoy as soon as it was practicable to do so. I am of the opinion that there was negligence on the part of the servants of the Crown to fail to replace those signs immediately after the second sign was missing. That would have been about the 7th or 8th of June more than ten days before the date of the accident giving rise to this petition.\nA similar failure to warn as to the dangerous menace to navigation was held in The King v. Hochelaga, supra, to be within the provisions of what was then s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act. The liability of the Crown is now founded on the provisions of s. 3(1) of the Crown Liability Act, 1952-53 Statutes of Canada, c. 30, and which provides:\n3. (1) The Crown is liable in tort for the damages for which, if it were a private person of full age and capacity, it would be liable\n(a) in respect of a tort committed by a servant of the Crown, or\n(b) in respect of a breach of duty attaching to the ownership, occupation, possession or control of property.\nIn my view, the liability of the Crown arises under both paras. (a) and (b) of that section.\nCounsel for the Crown has submitted a series of authorities which I have examined but in none of those authorities has it been held that the Crown is not liable when it has placed in a navigable water a menace to navigation and has failed to adequately warn of such menace. In Cleveland-Cliffs SS. Co. v. The Queen[2], the claim was based upon a grounding and the question arose whether the grounding was within or outside a marked channel. That was a grounding on the bottom not a mishap caused by the placing of an artificial obstruction under the water level.\nIron Ore Transport Co. Ltd. v. The Queen[3], was another case of the striking of a submerged and unidentified object which was not alleged by the suppliants to be any obstruction placed by the Crown.\nIn The Queen v. Moss[4], Sir Henry Strong C.J.C. said at p. 331:\nI quite concede, however, that assuming this northerly channel to be navigable water the erection in the river of a dam, by means of which the bridge was formed, would have been a public nuisance, unless it was in some way legalized by the action or acquiescence of the Crown. It is not sufficient to justify the placing of an obstruction in a public river or harbour that upon a balance of convenience the structure causing an obstruction to navigation should be of great public utility, far outweighing any inconvenience caused by it as a hindrance to navigation.\nAs I have pointed out, in The King v. Hochelaga, supra, the Crown was held liable for the dangerous menace to navigation which, in its result, had considerable resemblance to the case presently considered. There, a jetty had been constructed projecting at right angles from a breakwater. Before the jetty had been completed, about 50 feet of the upper portion of the outward end broke away leaving the lower portion of the cribwork and the rock ballast in position but entirely submerged. That submerged crib-work being invisible from the surface resembled the submerged weir in the present case which, on the 19th of June 1966, had some 28 inches of water flowing over the top of it. Therefore, I am of the opinion that the suppliants have established conduct of the Crown and its servants which would render the Crown subject to the liability claimed under s. 3(1) of the Crown Liability Act. The question to which I turn next is whether the conduct of the suppliant Egan Hendricks and the late Mrs. Hendricks disentitled them to recover. Egan Hendricks had been a resident of Winnipeg all of his life and, during the 7 or 8 years preceding the accident, had engaged actively in the operation of a boat for pleasure on the Red River as well as on many other waters in the province. He had owned a somewhat smaller boat and, during the course of the previous years had travelled in that boat about 6 or 7 times from Winnipeg downstream to the St. Andrew\u2019s Dam and Lock. On at least three of those occasions, he had proceeded through the St. Andrew\u2019s Lock to some destination downstream north of the dam. He had, on other occasions, driven by automobile from Winnipeg to the area. On all of those occasions, he had seen the two signs on the buoy to which I have already referred. Although Egan Hendricks was a boatman of some experience and although he had, as a member of the Redboyne Boat Club, received instructions as to the safe operation of small boats and had been provided with a pamphlet \u201cSafety Afloat\u201d which contained an outline of the Canadian Buoyage system, it was quite evident from his testimony that he had no understanding whatsoever of that system and, in short, he understood buoys as being only for the purpose of warning of an obstruction below the surface of the water and did not understand their prime purpose, the marking of the limits of the navigable channel. There were some 13 buoys between Winnipeg and the St. Andrew\u2019s Lock which on these 6 or 7 occasions Egan Hendricks had passed as he progressed along the course of the river, but he did not remember any of them as having been red, although, of course, all the buoys marking the one side of the channel would be red in colour while others marking the opposite side of the channel would be black in colour.\nLate in the year 1965, Egan Hendricks and the late Mrs. Hendricks, by the joint expenditure of their funds, purchased a new boat. This boat was 19 feet in length, had a beam of 7 feet and a depth of about 4 feet. This boat was propelled by a 90 h.p. Johnson outboard motor and its guidance was by a steering wheel on the starboard side toward the bow. The motor was operated by a unit control, one lever installed on the starboard bulwark which when pressed forward first engaged the forward gear and then when the pressure forward continued increased the speed of the motor and, similarly, when pressed backward first engaged the reverse gear and then on further pressure increased the speed of the motor in reverse. This boat was one month old when it was purchased by the Hendricks. It had been used very slightly, if at all, in the year 1965, and most infrequently in the year 1966. On June 19, 1966, the suppliant Egan Hendricks, his late wife, and a friend, Mr. John Atkinson, left the Redboyne Boat Club about 1:00 p.m. intending to go downstream and probably to Selkirk, which is some very considerable distance north, i.e., downstream, from the St. Andrew\u2019s Dam and Lock. The suppliant Egan Hendricks operated the boat at first with the late Mrs. Hendricks and Mr. Atkinson as passengers. To operate the boat, Mr. Hendricks sat on the starboard side facing forward, i.e., immediately behind the steering wheel. There was a like seat on the port side facing forward and then two seats faced the stern one behind each of the forward seats. When the party left after having lunch, the late Mrs. Hendricks took over the operation of the boat and Egan Hendricks and Mr. Atkinson sat in the seats facing the stern and conversed. The party was proceeding up to the St. Andrew\u2019s Dam and Lock and Mrs. Hendricks steered the boat toward the channel going down the west side of the artificial island toward the lock. It became apparent at once to Mr. Hendricks and it must have been as apparent to the late Mrs. Hendricks that the lock was not in operation as the berm of dry land across the channel was quite visible. In my view, the Hendricks\u2019 ignorance as to the Canadian Buoyage System is irrelevant as Mrs. Hendricks when operating the boat did keep the black buoy to her starboard side when she was proceeding downstream and, therefore, considering that the buoy marked the starboard side of the channel for downstream navigation, she left it on her starboard side. When it was apparent that the channel was blocked then, on Mr. Hendricks\u2019 evidence, Mrs. Hendricks turned back into the channel with the intention of starting back upstream toward Winnipeg. This left Mr. Hendricks and Mr. Atkinson, sitting as they were facing the stern, looking downstream toward the dam. Mr. Hendricks swore that he then perceived that the river flowed past the six piers with no kind of obstruction whatsoever and without any apparent break in the level of the water. In fact, looking under the bridge and between the piers, he saw several small boats to the north side of the bridge where the occupants were apparently engaged in fishing. At this time, the Hendricks boat was about one-quarter of a mile upstream, i.e., south of the bridge, and Mr. Hendricks was unshaken in his evidence that from that point there was no evidence whatsoever of any fall in the level of the water passing beneath the bridge. As I have said, Mr. Hendricks had, on 6 or 7 occasions before when at this area perceived a considerable waterfall on the north side of the bridge. Mr. Hendricks was equally certain in his evidence that on each of those occasions the gates and curtains were down and the slats were closed. Of course, at that time, Mr. Hendricks would have expected to see a waterfall on the downstream side of the dam. The purpose of the dam was to lift the level of the water and on the north side of the dam there would have had to be a waterfall. On this occasion, there was no dam whatsoever. The gates and curtains were all up beneath the floor of the bridge. The concrete weir part of the dam was hidden by 28\u2033 of water flowing over it. Of course, if one had been on the north side of the dam, one could most easily have perceived a waterfall of some 4 to 5 feet but from one-quarter of a mile south, i.e., upstream of the dam, that waterfall would be quite imperceptible.\nMr. Hendricks had seen the signs warning of the fall. He had noted that on this particular occasion those signs were not in place. Mr. Hendricks had noted that it was quite evidently impossible to get through the lock. He testified, therefore, that from these observations, he came to the conclusion that the fall created by the dam which he had observed on other occasions did not exist when the dam was open and the lock was not in use and that, therefore, the removal of the signs must indicate that there was no danger of falls and that his boat could proceed downstream without danger. Mr. Hendricks testified that from all appearances this bridge was just like the many other bridges between Winnipeg and the St. Andrew\u2019s Lock and his boat had passed safely beneath them all. Mr. Hendricks, therefore, instructed or suggested to the late Mrs. Hendricks that she should turn and pass beneath the bridge in the ordinary course, warning her to keep in the centre in order to avoid any obstructions which might be along the edge of the river. Mrs. Hendricks did operate the boat at some 10 or 12 miles an hour to the space between the 3rd and 4th piers from the west side. The boat so proceeded until it was within 50 feet of the weir. At that time, it became apparent to the late Mrs. Hendricks as well as to both Mr. Hendricks and Mr. Atkinson that there was a waterfall. The stream moved much more swiftly and the roar of the water as it went over the falls was audible. Mrs. Hendricks attempted to turn the boat in order to go back upstream. This, of course, only resulted in the boat going broadside to the current. There is a contradiction as to whether she attempted to reverse the propeller. Mr. Hendricks, at trial, testified firmly that she did not do so and that he did not order her to do so but in a statement given by him to the RCMP on the day of the accident and very shortly thereafter, he had said:\nThe wife tried to make a turn and so I said to put it in reverse. She put it in to reverse and the motor kicked up.\nThe passenger John Atkinson in a statement made at the same time said:\nAs we approached closer, we noticed there was quite a drop so Irene tried to get the boat in reverse but could not. Egan tried to get the motor in reverse but the motor kicked up.\nThe outboard motor in the Hendricks boat was held in its position down into the water by a lock. This lock was controlled in two different ways: firstly, there was on the dashboard and just to the left of the steering wheel, a lever which thrown one way would tilt the motor up and the other way would tilt it down, secondly, there was a manual control back at the motor. The motor could be driven either locked in the down position or without the lock on. Egan Hendricks testified that on this occasion the boat was being operated without the lock on so that if the propeller hit any submerged object the motor would come up without causing damage to it. He also admitted that when the lock was not in position and the motor was suddenly put into reverse the motor would come up out of the water with the result that neither the motor nor the attached rudder being in the water the boat could not be controlled in any way.\nThe learned trial judge found as negligence on the part of the suppliants the operation of the boat with the motor not locked in place and has evidently accepted the suppliant Egan Hendricks\u2019 earlier statement that the motor kicked up when an attempt was made to reverse the boat rather than his evidence at the trial that it was kicked up when the motor hit what the suppliant Hendricks described as a shelf but which must have been the top of the weir.\nI am of the opinion that no negligence in failing to put the lock on the motor before attempting to put it into reverse caused or contributed to the accident. Neither the suppliant Hendricks nor the late Mrs. Hendricks had attempted any evasive action, on Hendricks testimony, until their craft was within 50 feet of the submerged weir. Even if they had succeeded in getting the motor locked no putting of the motor into reverse could have avoided the catastrophe in the short seconds it would take the craft to go that distance of 50 feet and be over the dam. It was then relentlessly in the grip of the current headed over the dam. Moreover, it was broadside to the current due to the late Mrs. Hendricks\u2019 attempt to turn and even if the motor were operating in reverse with throttle open it could have had no preventive effect on the events which occurred. Those events were, of course, going over the top of the weir and down the five-foot falls. The boat was held under the falling water by the turbulence, filled and capsized. The late Mrs. Hendricks was drowned.\nNow on those facts, was either the suppliant Egan Hendricks or the late Mrs. Hendricks guilty of such negligence as would bar the sup- pliant recovering from the Crown in either his personal capacity or as administrator of the estate of his late wife? Certainly Cattanach J. so held in his reasons:\nOn the theory of legal causation his acts were the sole proximate cause of his harm. He was in a practical sense the author of his own misfortune even though the respondent might not have been without fault, but with respect to which I make no finding. This is not a case within the Tortfeasors and Contributory Negligence Act, 1954, R.S.M. chapter 266 because, as I have indicated, the negligence of the suppliants was the sole cause of the damage suffered,\nRitchie J. has come to a similar conclusion. With respect, I am of the opinion that such a conclusion is based on a misinterpretation of the evidence. Firstly, as I have said, the Red River was from the earliest days a navigable system and the suppliant had a legal right to be there. It is true that \u201cnavigation season\u201d had not opened. Section 1(g) of the Regulations for the Use and Operation of St. Andrew\u2019s Lock, P.C. 6514\/49, a copy of which the suppliant acknowledged had been supplied to him on an earlier trip through the lock, defined that season as being the period between the opening and closing of the lock for traffic. Section 4 thereof provided that the lock would be open each day and night during the \u201cseason of navigation\u201d but the suppliant was not attempting to go through the lock at a time other than during the \u201cseason of navigation\u201d. The lock plainly and visibly was not in operation, the channel thereto being barred by a berm of mud. What the appellant tried to do was to pass downstream under the bridge. Section 17(1) of the same regulations provided:\nVessels approaching Lock or Bridge\n17. (1) Every master or person in charge of any vessel on approaching the lock or bridge shall ascertain whether the lock or bridge is prepared to allow them to enter or pass, and stop the speed of any such vessel in sufficient time to avoid a collision with the lock or its gates, or with the bridge or other works.\nThe suppliant complied with the first requirement of this regulation and did determine that the lock was not prepared to allow him to enter. I am of the opinion that he also complied with the second requirement and determined that the bridge was prepared to allow him to enter. The suppliant, as I have stressed, had never seen the lock, dam and bridge except when the gates and curtains were down and had then and only then observed a waterfall on the north side thereof. On those occasions, he had also noted signs on the buoys warning of \u201cDanger\u2014Falls Ahead\u201d, referring to the very falls which he had observed. On this occasion, he observed from the south end of the channel, and then again from midstream, an ordinary six-pier bridge with no sign of any dam or gate or curtain. The suppliant, neither then nor on previous occasions, saw any concrete weir. In normal flow of water, that weir was covered with 14 feet of water, and even with the dam open with 28 inches of water. The suppliant, when the gates and curtains had been lowered on these previous occasions, had observed the signs warning of the waterfall and had also observed the waterfall which was the subject of such warning.\nOn June 19, on the other hand, the signs were not present and the gates and curtains which he knew caused the waterfall had been raised. The suppliant, therefore, concluded that the gates and curtains not being in place to stay the flow of the stream and cause the water to pile up against them, there would be no difference in the level of the water at either side of the bridge. I am of the opinion that the suppliant was justified in coming to that conclusion. From the point where he made the observation, about 400 yards to the south of the bridge and dam, he could neither see nor hear the waterfall and could see small boats in the area just north of the bridge. The suppliant was entirely ignorant of the large totally submerged concrete weir. Under all the circumstances present on the 19th of June, I have concluded that the suppliant, when he stood up in his boat at this point 400 yards away from the dam and bridge and looked north, was not negligent in determining that his boat could pass safely under the bridge and in instructing the late Mrs. Hendricks to so proceed.\nHowever, the suppliant then sat down in the seat facing the stern and resumed his conversa- tion with the passenger Mr. Atkinson. The boat moved forward at a speed of about 10 or 12 miles an hour. At the former speed, it would take 60 seconds to cover the 400 yards to the bridge. During that time, the suppliant should have been keeping a very close watch. The man\u0153uvre which he had directed the late Mrs. Hendricks to carry out was unusual and was one which he had not previously performed. There would seem to have been plenty of time to stop the forward progress of the boat had the suppliant and the others in the boat been alert. It is to be remembered that other small boats running back and forth across the fore bay had moved the superintendent to install the warning signs and that those boats, although their occupants had endangered themselves, had escaped in safety. Unfortunately, neither the suppliant nor the late Mrs. Hendricks, nor indeed their passenger Mr. Atkinson, sensed anything was amiss until the boat was only 50 feet upstream from the waterfall of 4 or 5 feet where the water tumbled over the northerly edge of the concrete weir. The learned trial judge assessed that weir as being 35 feet wide at the base. A reference to the sketch which he used (Ex. 9) would appear to show that the weir was 30 feet wide across its top. So the boat must have been only 20 feet south of the southerly edge of the weir when the late Mrs. Hendricks operating it and the other two at the same moment appreciated their plight. As I have pointed out, it was then impossible to prevent the catastrophe, particularly when in an attempt to go back upstream the late Mrs. Hendricks had turned the boat so it was broadside to the rushing current. I am of the opinion that this lack of proper attention and failure to keep the boat under control during the progress forward from the point of turning to the moment when, all too late, they appreciated the danger, was negligence on the part of the suppliant and of the late Mrs. Hendricks.\nI am, however, not of the opinion that this negligence can be separated in time from that which I have outlined above as being attributable to the Crown. It was the negligence in the failure to replace the warning signs which caused the suppliant to determine to carry out what turned out to be a fatal man\u0153uvre and which led him to believe that the late Mrs. Hendricks could drive the boat forward under the bridge safely. Acts of negligence on both sides were, in my opinion, operating simultaneously.\nI am further of the opinion that the suppliant and his late wife are identified in the negligent operation of the boat. It was the suppliant who determined that the boat should be driven under the bridge and so instructed his wife. It was the suppliant who sat facing the stern and failed to keep a proper lookout which would have warned him of the danger in time. However, the late Mrs. Hendricks, with the same knowledge as her husband, did drive the boat forward and she herself failed to keep the sharp lookout necessary. They committed the same acts of negligence. Therefore, as to both the suppliant claiming on his own behalf and as administrator of the estate of his late wife, I would apply the Tortfeasors and Contributory Negligence Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 266. I am of the opinion that the facts which I have outlined justify the equal division of the negligence between the suppliant and the Crown.\nThe learned trial judge, despite his refusal to grant any relief, very properly made a detailed assessment of the damages which he would have awarded had he found otherwise on the question of liability. The learned trial judge set these damages out as follows:\n(1) Special damages to the suppliant on his own behalf for damage to the boat and loss of personal property..............................................\n$ 670.00\n(2) General damages to the suppliant on his own behalf....................\nNil\n(3) Special damages under the Trustee Act for funeral expenses.....\n929.11\n(4) General damages under the Fatal Accidents Act and the Trustee Act for pecuniary loss to the suppliant and and his daughter\n20,000.00\n(5) General damages under the Trustee Act for pain and suffering and loss of expectancy of life.................................................................\n2,500.00 Counsel for the suppliant has agreed that the damage item set out by the learned trial judge in No. (5) is covered by the allowance made in No. (4). With this I agree.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs here and in the Exchequer Court and grant the appellant judgment for 50 per cent of the other damages as found by the learned trial judge, i.e., $21,599.11. That amount is $10,799.55.\nAppeal allowed with costs, ABBOTT and RITCHIE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Walsh, Micay & Company, Winnipeg.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent: D.S.

II, c. 67, s. 24.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s wife was killed and the defendant seriously injured, when the plaintiff\u2019s automobile collided with the rear of the defendant\u2019s horse-drawn farm vehicle. The accident occurred after nightfall. The plaintiff was driving with his headlights on, but the defendant\u2019s vehicle had neither light nor reflector. The Superior Court held both parties at fault and assessed the plaintiff\u2019s liability at 40 per cent and the defendant\u2019s at 60 per cent. This judgment was affirmed by a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal. The defendant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nAlthough the Highway Code does not require a red light or reflector in the rear of animal\u2011drawn vehicles, this does not mean that driving at night a horse-drawn vehicle without a light or reflector cannot be considered as negligence. To hold this to be negligent is not to usurp the functions of the legislature and to create an obligation that it has always refused to impose. The statutory provisions do not mention all the obligations incumbent upon the citizens. There is no reason to refuse to follow the Quebec courts which, for over thirty years, have held it to be negligent to drive an animal-drawn vehicle without a light or reflector, on a public road at night. There is no reason to interfere with the concurrent findings as to the apportionment of liability or the assessment of damages. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], affirming a judgment of Girouard J. Appeal dismissed.\nAndr\u00e9 Marceau, for the defendant, appellant.\nAndr\u00e9 Gagnon, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nPIGEON J.\u2014The accident with which the present case is concerned occurred under the following circumstances. On a Sunday evening, September 25, 1960, after nightfall, the appellant, a farmer, was driving on the Ste. Anne Range road to St. Narcisse de Lotbini\u00e8re. This local road had recently been paved with asphalt; the paving was 22 feet wide and there was no white line in the centre such as on highways. On each side there was a gravel shoulder which Wilfrid Gagn\u00e9, a witness at the trial, measured as four feet wide. The appellant\u2019s vehicle was a platform about six feet wide mounted on automobile wheels beyond which it protruded about five inches on either side. It was being drawn by a horse walking on the extreme right-hand side of the paving, both right wheels being on the gravel shoulder. Thus the vehicle was taking up four or five feet of the paved part of the road. It had neither light nor reflector. The appellant was sitting on the left-hand side, his son on the right, and there were also two little boys eight to ten years old. The appellant had been tending the animals on his son\u2019s farm and was returning to his own, nine arpents to the east. The vehicle was being used solely for carrying its four occupants.\nAs for the respondent, he was driving home in his car from Drummondville to St. Narcisse, going in the same direction as the appellant. He was perfectly well acquainted with the locality, since he used this road every day to go to and from work in Quebec City. It should be noted that he worked at night, leaving home around 8:30 in the evening and coming back around 7:30 in the morning. That evening, however, which was a Sunday, he had stopped to have something to eat on the way home. Driving with his headlights on, he saw another car coming in the opposite direction. When he was still four or five arpents from it, he dimmed his lights and the other car did likewise. As soon as it had passed he turned his lights up again and saw appellant\u2019s vehicle. He swerved to the left and applied his brakes, but was unable to avoid the collision. His wife, seated on his right, was instantly killed by a platform plank going through the windshield. Appellant\u2019s left leg was shattered and had to be amputated above the knee. His right leg was also hurt and as a result of the accident he is permanently disabled.\nOn respondent\u2019s action and appellant\u2019s cross demand, the Superior Court (Wilfrid Girouard J.) held both parties at fault, respondent for not slowing down when he saw the other automobile approaching, appellant for driving without a light. For this, the percentages of liability were assessed at 40 per cent and 60 per cent respectively. The damages arising from the death of respondent\u2019s wife, who was 21 years of age, pregnant and the mother of a two-year-old daughter and a ten-month-old son, were fixed at the sum of $30,000, namely $20,000 to the plaintiff personally and $10,000 in his capacity as tutor. The damages suffered by appellant for permanent disability were set at $15,000. Adding other items, respondent\u2019s total claim for damages was fixed at $31,126.60 and appellant\u2019s at $20,469.70. Compensation having been effected in accordance with the percentages of liability, appellant found himself condemned to pay $8,187.88 with interest from January 23, 1961.\nThe Court of Appeal[2] dismissed appellant\u2019s appeal; however, Badeaux J., dissenting, was of the opinion that respondent should have been held solely responsible for the accident because appellant was leaving enough space for other vehicles and was not obliged to have either a light or a reflector in the rear of his vehicle.\nOn that point, appellant argued that the legislature, a few months before the accident, had completely revised the Highway Code provisions concerning lights and reflectors (8-9 Eliz. II, c. 67, s. 24) and that the new provisions, as previously, required red lights in the rear of automobiles and trailers and a red light or a reflector in the rear of all bicycles and tricycles, but included no such requirement for animal\u2011drawn vehicles.\nDoes this mean that driving at night a horse-drawn vehicle without a light or reflector cannot be considered as negligence? I do not think so. To hold this to be negligent is not, as was suggested, to usurp the functions of the legislature and to create an obligation that it has always refused to impose. Although extremely important from the point of view of civil responsibility, the section of the Highway Code is, essentially, a statutory provision to which a penalty is attached. Until such time as the legislature adds to it a provision applicable to cases such as the one before us, the police will obviously be unable to issue tickets in such cases and the courts of summary jurisdiction will be unable to impose penalties. This does not mean that the civil courts are not entitled to consider that a fault has been committed, because the statutory provisions do not mention all the obligations incumbent upon the citizens.\nFor over thirty years now the Quebec courts have held it to be negligent to drive an animal\u2011drawn vehicle without a light or reflector, on a public road at night. I can see no reason to hold otherwise. It is true that there is evidence in the record that this particular imprudent act is general in the locality in question; this does not suffice, however, to bring the case within the rule applied in The London & Lancashire v. La Compagnie F.X. Drolet[3], that a defendant charged with negligence can clear his feet, if he shows that he has acted in accordance with general and approved practice. In view of the numerous court decisions which have uniformly condemned it over the past thirty years, this deplorable practice, in so far as it may continue to exist, can no longer be regarded as \u201capproved\u201d. The above conclusion is sufficient to dispose of the case. It is our rule not to interfere with concurrent findings of fact except in the case of a clear error in the appreciation of the evidence. I can find no such error in the apportionment of the liability or the assessment of damages. On those questions we are not called upon to decide, if sitting in first instance, we would have reached the same result as the trial judge, but only whether he made a wholly erroneous estimate, and this the appellant has failed to show.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Marquis, Marceau & Jessop, Quebec.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Gagnon, de Billy, Cantin & Dionne, Quebec.\n[1] [1965] Que.

He was found by the police in a hotel bedroom in bed with another man, who was a female impersonator, and their respective positions in relation to each other were such as to justify the police in thinking that an act of gross indecency was taking place or was about to take place. The respondent seemed stunned after the entry of the police and during the interview that then took place. His defence was that he had believed his companion to be a woman. He sought to support his own evidence in this regard by the evidence of a psychiatrist. The trial judge excluded the psychiatric evidence based on interviews and tests which was tendered for the purpose of showing that the respondent had a certain type of defence mechanism which made him react violently against any homosexual activity and that he therefore would not have knowingly engaged in the homosexual practices which formed the subject of the charge. The majority of the Court of Appeal held the evidence to be admissible, set aside the conviction and directed a new trial. The Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Ritchie and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.\nPer Martland and Judson JJ.: The evidence in question was inadmissible. The psychiatrist was being tasked for an opinion, not as to whether the respondent was mentally capable of formulating an intent to commit the crime, but as to whether he did, on the facts of this case, formulate such an intent. There is no authority which establishes that the evidence of a psychiatrist can be introduced for a purpose such as this. What is sought to be done here is to enable a professional man to express his view to the jury upon the issue of the intent of the accused, upon evidence which is not before the jury, and which is, in part, hearsay evidence from the accused himself. The decision of this Court in Wilband v. R., [1967] S.C.R. 14, is not contrary to this conclusion.\nPer Hall J.: The trial judge should have admitted all the evidence which the psychiatrist was prepared to give. Whatever other causes there may be for the condition of homosexuality, psychological factors are of great importance. It follows that the evidence of psychiatrist is particularly relevant in cases involving homosexuality and the admissibility of opinion evidence from psychiatrists must be determined by its relevancy to the matter in issue at the trial. The evidence was relevant to the defence being put forward on behalf of the respondent, it was therefore admissible and the trial judge erred in rejecting it.\nHowever, this was a proper case for the application of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code. The evidence against the respondent was overwhelming and the verdict would necessarily have been the same even if the jury had heard the opinion which the psychiatrist was prepared to give.\nPer Ritchie and Spence JJ., dissenting: The trial judge should have admitted the evidence in question. The fact that the methods pursued by the psychiatrist in reaching his opinion necessitated dependence on information obtained from the respondent and others which was not before the jury, does not make his opinion inadmissible although it may well be a fact to be considered in assessing the weight to be attached to it. The admission of the psychiatrist\u2019s evidence as to the respondent\u2019s normal state of mind would not have offended the rule against the admissibility of hearsay. On the record, the evidence was tendered for the purpose of proving the doctor\u2019s opinion that this particular man had a certain type of defence mechanism that made him react violently against homosexual behaviour. The question of whether or not a man is homosexually inclined or otherwise sexually perverted is one upon which an experienced psychiatrist is qualified to express an opinion and if such opinion is relevant, as it is here, it should be admitted at a trial such as this even if it involves the psychiatrist in expressing his conclusion that the accused does not have the capacity to commit the crime with which he is charged.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], setting aside the conviction of the respondent and directing a new trial. Appeal allowed and conviction restored, Ritchie and Spence JJ. dissenting.\nW.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the appellant.\nG.A. Martin, Q.C., and R.V. Carter, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Martland and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.\u2014This is an appeal by the Crown from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1, Davey C.J. dissenting, which set aside the conviction of the respondent of attempting to commit an act of gross indecency, and directed a new trial.\nThe facts are as follows:\nOn February 3, 1967, in the early hours of the morning, the respondent was observed leaving a cabaret with a person dressed and made up as a woman and taking a taxi to a hotel where, after registering under a false name, the two went to a room. Police officers listened at the locked door for some minutes, heard male voices conversing in French, obtained the key for the room from the hotel clerk and entered. They found the respondent and the other person naked on a bed. They noticed that the other person was a male, still wearing the blond female wig and heavy facial makeup in which he had been seen earlier. Although the officers saw no activity between the two on the bed, at the time of entry, their position was such that the respondent\u2019s head was lying a very short distance from the female impersonator\u2019s genital organs. The officers saw the respondent swing around on the bed away from that position. The respondent seemed stunned after the entry and during the interview that then took place with the police officers.\nThe respondent\u2019s defence was that he had believed his companion to be a woman.\nThe legal issue to be determined in this appeal is as to the admissibility of psychiatric evidence tendered on behalf of the respondent, which the trial judge ruled was inadmissible, but which the majority of the Court of Appeal held to be admissible.\nThe nature of the proposed evidence was described by counsel for the respondent in the following statement to the Court at trial:\nThe purpose for which I am attempting to tender this evidence is for the Doctor to describe what is the normal state of mind of Mr. Lupien, and on that basis compare the normal state of mind to the events that occurred in the room. When that is done then the Doctor has a norm from which to draw, upon which to base his opinion. Now that fundamentally is the basis upon which this evidence is being tendered.\nCounsel then proceeded to review the nature and extent of the proposed psychiatric evidence as follows:\nThe Doctor will say that this man had a certain type of defensive mechanism that made him react violently to any homosexual overtone. He will say that is the normal state. And then he will compare that opinion with what occurred this night and say, \u201cTaking the two together and having regard to the impact of one upon the other I have the following opinion to say, namely, he must have believed this person was a woman,\u201d and in so far his perception was diminished because of the things I did state in the hypothetical question, that because his perception was diminished one of two things occur, either he was not consciously aware of the genital organ he saw in front of him in the sense of being able to understand the person was a male or as soon as he became aware of it he should have rejected it and it would be inconceivable for him not to reject it.\nThe psychiatric examination involved the obtaining of information from the respondent and the psychiatrist said:\nThis is where I would have to assume the truthfulness of what he said referable to his background, his attitudes, his feelings, his beliefs, those things that would allow me to gain some idea and some opinion as to the sort of person that this man is, basically. As far as an answer to the question as to the state of this man\u2019s mind at the time or what happened at that time or what his thinking was at that time, no, it was not necessary to rely upon the truthfulness of what he had to say.\nEssentially, the opinion would be that, based upon the psychiatric examination, the respondent\u2019s defence must be true.\nIn criminal trials, psychiatric evidence is most frequently introduced in cases where a plea of insanity is raised. There the issue is as to mental capacity and the opinions of experts on the subject of disease of the mind are clearly relevant and admissible.\nIn cases under s. 661 of the Criminal Code, involving the determination as to whether or not the accused is a dangerous sexual offender, the Court is required to hear the evidence of at least two psychiatrists. The reason for this provision would appear to be that the Court is being asked to forecast the likelihood, in the future, of a particular form of behaviour. The issue is not as to guilt in respect of a crime. It was in respect of this kind of inquiry that Fauteux J., delivering the judgment of the Court in Wilband v. R.[2], defined the permissible sources of information upon which the psychiatrist could properly rely, including second-hand information. In Fisher v. R.[3], which involved a charge of murder, the defence was that the accused was top drunk to have been capable of forming the requisite intent. The evidence of the Crown consisted largely of a statement given by the accused, which gave details of his movements before and after the killing, which he admitted. Psychiatric evidence was admitted in that case, in relation to the issue of mental capacity. The witness, having read the statement and being asked a hypothetical question, in which were included substantially the material facts related in the statement, stated that, in his opinion, anyone capable of doing what the accused was alleged to have done, would have the capacity to form an intent to murder, even if he had consumed 25 glasses of beer, or more.\nThere is no submission by the respondent in this case as to incapacity to form an intent to commit the crime charged, on the basis of insanity, drunkenness, or any other cause. The evidence which counsel for the respondent sought to lead was not to show that he was mentally incapable of forming the intent to commit the crime with which he was charged. Its purpose was to establish (partly on the basis of what the respondent had told the witness) that because the respondent normally reacted violently to homosexual practices he must have been telling the truth when, in the proved situation in which he was discovered, he said he thought his companion was a women. In other words, the psychiatrist is being asked for an opinion, not as to whether the respondent was mentally capable of formulating an intent, but as to whether he did, on the facts of this case, formulate such intent. We have not been referred to any Canadian or English authority which establishes that the evidence of a psychiatrist can be introduced for a purpose such as this. If such evidence is held to be admissible in a case of this kind, then there would seem to be no reason why, on a charge of murder, psychiatric evidence could not be led as to the innate abhorrence of the accused in respect of physical violence, or on a charge of theft, of the innate respect of the accused for private property rights.\nI agree with the view expressed by Davey C.J. in this case:\nThe opinion that Lupien would not have knowingly engaged in the acts alleged is in the particular circumstances of this case too dangerous to be admitted, because without any necessity it comes too close to the very thing the jury had to find on the whole of the evidence.\nThe jury is required to determine the intent of the accused upon the evidence before it. What is sought to be done here is to enable a professional man to express his view to the jury upon that issue, upon evidence which is not before the jury, and which is, in part, hearsay evidence from the accused himself. In my opinion evidence of this kind should not be admitted.\nI do not regard the decision of this Court in the Wilband case, supra as being contrary to this conclusion. As I have already indicated, the psychiatric evidence in question in that case was required to be heard by virtue of s. 661(2) of the Criminal Code on a hearing to determine whether an accused person, already convicted, was a dangerous sexual offender. That determination involved an inquiry as to whether he was a person likely to cause injury, pain or other evil to any person through failure to control his sexual impulses or was likely to commit a further sexual offence. On that issue Parliament has required that the Court have the assistance of evidence from at least two psychiatrists. The Wilband case held that, in giving their evidence, they were entitled to form an opinion through recognized psychiatric procedures and to consider all possible sources of information.\nIn the present case the issue is as to guilt on the basis of proved facts, which already exist, not a forecast as to future conduct. In this case there is no statutory requirement to hear psychia- tric evidence. It is sought to adduce such opinion evidence on the very issue which the jury is bound to determine on the facts proved before it.\nFor these reasons, I would allow the appeal and restore the conviction and sentence.\nThe judgment of Ritchie and Spence J.J. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J. (dissenting)\u2014This is an appeal brought by the Attorney General of British Columbia under the provisions of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[4] (Davey C.J. dissenting) whereby that Court set aside the conviction of the respondent for attempting to commit an act of gross indecency and ordered a new trial limited to that issue.\nThe respondent was found by the police in a hotel bedroom in bed with another man, who was a female impersonator, and there is, in my view, no doubt that their respective positions in relation to each other were such as to justify the police in thinking that an act of gross indecency was taking place or was about to take place.\nThe respondent\u2019s main defence was that at all times, until just before the police entered the room, he thought that his companion was a woman, and it was sought to support his own evidence in this regard by the evidence of Dr. Newman, a highly qualified psychiatrist, who was present throughout the trial and who had interviewed the respondent and others and subjected the respondent to certain psychiatric tests for the purpose of determining what his normal state was in relation to sex.\nCounsel for the Crown took objection to the introduction of this evidence from Dr. Newman and after lengthy argument from counsel on both sides, the learned trial judge ruled that questioning by defence counsel in this regard should be limited to asking the doctor a hypothetical question based on the assumption of the truth of the evidence adduced at the trial in order to obtain his opinion as to the effect which the respondent\u2019s lack of sleep, heavy work schedule and consumption of liquor had had on his state of mind at the time when he was found in such a compromising position by the police officers in the early hours of the morning.\nThe learned trial judge, however, excluded the psychiatric evidence based on interviews and tests which was tendered for the purpose of showing that, in Dr. Newman\u2019s opinion, Lupien had a certain type of defence mechanism which made him react violently against any homosexual activity and that he therefore would not have knowingly engaged in the homosexual practices which formed the subject of the charge.\nThe members of the Court of Appeal were unanimous in expressing the opinion, with which I agree, that the doctor\u2019s opinion given in answer to the hypothetical question which was put to him was properly admitted in evidence, but the majority of the Court, in ordering a new trial, took the view that the learned trial judge had erred in excluding the doctor\u2019s opinion based on the interviews he had conducted and on the psychiatric tests and procedures to which he subjected the respondent. It is the dissenting opinion of the learned Chief Justice in this latter regard which forms the basis of this appeal.\nIn excluding the opinion formed by the doctor as a result of his own investigations and tests, the learned trial judge cited the decision of this Court in Bleta v. The Queen[5], where it was said, at p. 564:\nThe question of whether or not an accused person was in a state of automatism so as not to be legally responsible at the time when he committed the acts with which he is charged, is a question of fact, and indeed may be the most vital question of fact in a criminal case, and it is because the opinion of an expert witness on such a question can serve only to confuse the issue unless the proven facts upon which it is based have been clearly indicated to the jury that the practice has grown up of requiring counsel, when seeking such an opinion, to state those facts in the form of a hypothetical question.\nThe case of Bleta v. The Queen, supra, was concerned with the proper way in which to elicit an opinion from an expert witness based upon evidence which has been adduced in his presence at the trial. The sentence cited by the learned trial judge from the decision of this Court is directly followed in the same paragraph by these words:\nIn cases where the expert has been present throughout the trial and there is conflict between the witnesses, it is obviously unsatisfactory to ask him to express an opinion based upon the evidence which he had heard because the answer to such a question involves the expert in having to resolve the conflict in accordance with his own view of the credibility of the witnesses and the jury has no way of knowing upon what evidence he based his opinion. Where, however, there is no conflict in the evidence, the same difficulty does not necessarily arise and different considerations may therefore apply.\nThe Bleta case came to this Court on appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which had allowed an appeal by the Crown and ordered a new trial on the ground, inter alia, that a doctor called for the defence \u201cwas improperly permitted to express an opinion based on his assessment of the evidence.\u201d There is no such suggestion in the present case and I do not think that the Bleta case is to be taken as deciding that a counsel is precluded from eliciting the opinion of a doctor as to a person\u2019s state of health based on his medical knowledge and on his questioning of his patient out of the presence of the jury.\nIt was contended in the present case that Dr. Newman\u2019s opinion as to the way in which the respondent would normally react to homosexual advances was inadmissible as offending the rule against the introduction of hearsay evidence in that it must of necessity have been based upon what he was told by the respondent and others in the course of the interviews he conducted and on the results of the tests which he had carried out. The truth of any statements made to the doctor in the course of his psychiatric enquiry was not at issue in the present case. What was being sought here was evidence of the opinion which he had formed as the result of applying his medical knowledge of an analysis of the respondent\u2019s disposition as manifested by his words, attitudes and reactions when subjected to questioning, and to other psychiatric procedures designed to reveal his true character. It is the admissibility or inadmissibility of an opinion so formed which is at issue here and, in my view, the fact that the methods pursued by the psychiatrist in reaching his opinion necessitated dependence on information obtained from the respondent and others which was not before the jury, does not make his opinion inadmissible although it may well be a factor to be considered in assessing the weight to be attached to that opinion. If it were otherwise, the Courts would be denied many medical opinions based on clinical methods of diagnosis.\nIn the case of Wilband v. Her Majesty the Queen[6], the point was taken that certain evidence given by psychiatrists under the provisions of s. 661(2) of the Criminal Code was inadmissible as offending against the hearsay rule, and in the course of his reasons for judgment, Mr. Justice Fauteux had this to say, at p. 21:\nDealing with hearsay:\u2014The evidence, in this case, indicates that to form on opinion according to recognized normal psychiatric procedures, the psychiatrist must consider all possible sources of information, including second-hand source information, the reliability, accuracy and significance of which are within the recognized scope of his professional activities, skill and training to evaluate. Hence, while ultimately his conclusion may rest, in part, or second-hand source material, it is nonetheless an opinion formed according to recognized normal psychiatric procedures. It is not to be assumed that Parliament contemplated that the opinion which the psychiatrists would form and give to assist the Court would be formed by methods other than those recognized in normal psychiatric procedures. The value of a psychiatrist\u2019s opinion may be affected to the extent to which it may rest on second-hand source material; but that goes to the weight and not to the receivability in evidence of the opinion, which opinion is no evidence of the truth of the information but evidence of the opinion formed on the basis of that information.\nIt is true that in the Wilband case Mr. Justice Fauteux was considering psychiatric evidence on the issue of whether an accused person who had already been convicted was \u201ca dangerous sexual offender\u201d, and that it was the status of the accused rather than his guilt or innocence which was at issue, but I am satisfied that what was said in that case in relation to the hearsay rule applies with equal force to the present circumstances.\nIn view of the above, I am of the opinion that the admission of the psychiatric evidence sought to be adduced from Dr. Newman as to the respondent\u2019s normal state of mind would not have offended the rule against the admissibility of hearsay, but this is far from the end of the matter as the dissent of the learned Chief Justice is based on broader grounds. In the course of his reasons for judgment he said:\nI would exclude the evidence on the broad ground that it was not admissible for the purpose it was tendered. It must be clearly understood what that purpose was, so I reiterate that it was to show that Lupien\u2019s normal personality and his defence mechanisms would cause him to reject homosexual advances or commerce, and so in the opinion of the experts he would not knowingly have engaged in them. They sought to explain the evidence on the ground that Lupien must have honestly believed Boisvert to be a woman, or by impairment of his understanding and judgment.\nThe opinion that Lupien would not have knowingly engaged in the acts alleged is in the particular circumstances of this case too dangerous to be admitted, because without any necessity it comes too close to the very thing the jury had to find on the whole of the evidence. But there is a more basic objection. Put in simple English the doctors were being invited to say that Lupien was a normal man, and as a normal man he would be instinctively repelled by and recoil from a homosexual act. The jurors were the proper people to say what a normal man would do in those circumstances for that would depend upon their knowledge of people.\nI agree with the Chief Justice that if the evidence had been tendered for the purpose of showing that Lupien was a normal man, the conclusion as to how he would have acted under the circumstances would have been a question for the jury; but, with all respect, as I understand the record, the evidence was not tendered for this purpose at all but rather for the purpose of proving the doctor\u2019s opinion that this particular man bad a certain type of defence mechanism that made him react violently against homosexual behaviour. The evidence which the learned trial judge excluded was described by the respondent\u2019s counsel in the following terms:\nNow, here the doctor will say\u2014and I am going to be a little bit inept in doing it\u2014the doctor will say that this man had a certain type of defensive mechanism that made him react violently to any homosexual overtone. He will say that is the normal state. And then he will compare that opinion with what occurred this night and say, \u201cTaking the two together and having regard to the impact of one upon the other I have the following opinion to say, namely, he must have believed this person was a woman\u201d, and (2) in so far his perception was diminished because of the things I did state in the hypothetical question, that because his perception was diminished one of two things occur, either he was not consciously aware of the genital organ he saw in front of him in the sense of being able to understand the person was a male or (2) as soon as he became aware of it he should have rejected it and it would be inconceivable for him not to reject it.\nAs I understand it, the evidence thus sought to be adduced was directed towards obtaining Dr. Newman\u2019s opinion to the effect that the respondent was so constituted as to be incapable of formulating the intention to commit a homosexual act, and it appears to me that the question of whether or not a man has homosexual tendencies or inclinations is one which is well adapted to the diagnosis of a psychiatrist and that such an opinion formed in this area of human behaviour is relevant and admissible in a case such as the present one.\nThis was not a question of adducing character evidence in the sense of reputation, and I think that the rule laid down in 1865 by Cockburn C.J., in Reg. v. Rowton[7], to the effect that evidence of character can only be introduced by seeking evidence of the accused\u2019s general reputation in the neighbourhood to which he belongs, is singularly inappropriate to the introduction of evidence from psychiatrists as to the accused\u2019s disposition.\nThe Rowton case was decided many years before the development of psychiatry as an accepted branch of medicine and we were not referred to any case in which the rule there stated was applied so as to exclude such evidence.\nIn the course of his reasons for judgment in the case of Fisher v. The Queen[8], with which nine members of this Court were \u201cin substantial agreement\u201d (see [1961] S.C.R. 535 at 538) Aylesworth J.A. said at page 21, speaking of the evidence of the pyschiatrist called by the Crown in that case:\nHe was, of course, assuming the facts given him as an hypothesis to be true, giving his opinion upon one of the vital issues to be decided by the jury, but that does not per se render his opinion inadmissible. \u2026Psychiatry is a comparatively modern and special branch of medical science which deals with the study of the mind, the working of the mind, the mental state of an individual as demonstrated by his conversation, attitude and actions. I entertian no doubt that Dr. Easton as a specialist in psychiatry for many years and with the experience which his position entails, is qualified to express an opinion upon the mental capacity of an individual such as appellant to form a certain intent,\u2026\nIn the Fisher case the accused, who was charged with murder, had given a statement to the police in which he described in great detail his activities during the evening up until the time when the murder was alleged to have taken place. In the course of the cross\u2011examination of certain Crown witnesses it became apparent that an attempt was being made to make out a defence of drunkenness and before closing the case for the prosecution, the Crown called Dr. Baston, the Director of Psychiatry at the Ontario Hospital in New Toronto, who was asked a hypothetical question based in large measure on the statement made by the accused to the police in answer to which he expressed the opinion that anyone able to do what the appellant was alleged to have done could have the capacity to form the intent to murder, even after he had consumed 25 glasses of beer or more. It appears to me that the opinion so sought by the Crown came as close as possible to being evidence of the very thing that the jury had to find if the defence of drunkenness was to be negated and the accused convicted. In approving the admission of the psychiatrist\u2019s evidence, Aylesworth J.A. concluded, at page 21:\nThe relation of appellant\u2019s actions and conduct, as posed to the doctor, to appellant\u2019s mental capacity, was surely a matter upon which the witness could call into play his special knowledge in that field. The fact that the witness did not examine the appellant, in my opinion, can have no bearing upon the question of the admissibility of his evidence; the whole basis of his evidence, as has been said already, was the effect of appellant\u2019s activities as demonstrating to an expert in the field of psychiatry, the presence or absence of a specific degree of mental capacity. While the value of that evidence was for the jury, it was in my view, admissible evidence.\n(The italics are my own.)\nWhat was sought to be introduced in the present case was evidence from a specialist in the field of psychiatry as to the absence of a specific degree of behavoural capacity and I think that Mr. Justice Aylesworth\u2019s language applies and that \u201cwhile the value of that evidence was for the jury it was\u2026 admissible evidence.\u201d\nI am far from saying that as a general rule psychiatric evidence of a man\u2019s disinclination to commit the kind of crime with which he is charged should be admitted, but the present case is con- cerned with gross indecency between two men and I think that crimes involving homosexuality stand in a class by themselves in the sense that the participants frequently have characteristics which make them more readily identifiable as a class than ordinary criminals. See Reg. v. Thompson[9]. In any event, it appears to me that the question of whether or not a man is homosexually inclined or otherwise sexually perverted is one upon which an experienced psychiatrist is qualified to express an opinion and that if such opinion is relevant it should be admitted at a trial such as this even if it involves the psychiatrist in expressing his conclusion that the accused does not have the capacity to commit the crime with which he is charged.\nFor all these reasons, as well as for those expressed in the reasons for judgment rendered by Mr. Justice Bull on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal, I would dismiss this appeal.\nHALL J.\u2014The facts relative to this appeal are set out in the reasons of my brothers Martland and Ritchie.\nI agree with my brother Ritchie that the learned trial judge should have admitted all the evidence which the psychiatrist, Dr. Newman, was prepared to give.\nHomosexuality is not a disease of the mind nor a mental illness nor a condition arising out of mental incapacity or deficiency. It is a sexual attraction and interest between members of the same sex. There are all gradations of the condition from those at the one end of the scale who have never had a normal sexual impulse to those at the other end who are only homosexual under exceptional conditions; e.g., when they are totally segregated from the opposite sex, and in their case their homosexuality generally disappears as soon as they return to a normal environment. In between, others have both homosexual and heterosexual impulses and are known as \u201cbisexuals\u201d. In whatever category the homosexual falls, his condition is an acquired aberration from the normal state. No one is destined at birth to be a homosexual any more than any given individual is earmarked to be an alcoholic or a drug addict. Heredity plays no part in the development. Environment is said to be the decisive factor.\nThe literature on the subject of homosexuality is very divergent in attributing specific causes or reasons for the condition, but all writers are agreed that whatever other causes there may be psychological factors are of great importance and are to be considered in what might be termed an ascending scale of complexity of explanation. Psychiatry has concerned itself in a special way with the study of homosexuality, and\n\u2026throughout psychiatry one finds that the structure of the personality is an interplay between environment and constitutional endowment, so much so that it is almost possible to devise an equation that constitution X the environment = a constant. (\u201cThey Stand Apart\u201d, Windmill Press, London, 1955, p. 78.)\nAccordingly it follows that the evidence of psychiatrists is particularly relevant in cases involving homosexuality and the admissibility of opinion evidence from psychiatrists must be determined by its relevancy to the matter in issue at the trial. In the present case the learned trial judge admitted all the evidence being tendered from Dr. Newman except the opinion he was prepared to give to the effect that Lupien\u2019s normal personality and his defence mechanisms would cause him to reject homosexual advances and that he would not knowingly have engaged in them. Dr. Newman was allowed to answer the hypothetical question put to him based on the assumption of the truth of the evidence adduced at the trial but was not permitted to give the opinion above set out based on tests made by and for him and in conversations with Lupien.\nIt is a question where the line between admissibility and inadmissibility is to be drawn. If the evidence was relevant to the defence being put forward on behalf of Lupien, and I think it was, then it was admissible and the learned trial judge erred in rejecting it.\nIt is true, as Davey C.J.B.C. points out in his dissent, that the answer which the psychiatrist was expected to give \u201ccomes too close to the very thing the jury had to find on the whole of the evidence\u201d. I do not think that this is a valid reason for rejecting the evidence. Actually it cannot be considered an innovation in regard to medical evidence. Psychiatrists are permitted to testify that from their examination and study, sometimes long after the event, of an accused, including conversations with him and from facts proven in evidence, that the accused was incapable of forming the intent necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged. That type of evidence is very close, if not identical, to the conclusion the jury must come to in such a case if it is to find that the accused was not guilty because he did not have intent necessary to support conviction. The weight to be given the opinion of the expert is entirely for the jury, and it is the function of the trial judge to instruct the jury that the responsibility for weighing the evidence is theirs and theirs alone.\nThe next question for decision is whether the error in this instance was fatal to a valid conviction or whether the provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) which read:\n592. (1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction, the court of appeal\n(b) may dismiss the appeal where\u2026\n(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred;\nshould be applied.\nThe conditions under which this provision should be invoked are set out in the reasons of Cartwright J. (now C.J.C.) in Colpitts v. The Queen[10] as follows:\nA number of authorities which should guide the Court of Appeal in deciding whether, misdirection having been shewn, it can safely be affirmed that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred are quoted in the reasons of my brother Spence. Upon reading these it will be observed that, once error in law has been found to have occurred at the trial, the onus resting upon the Crown is to satisfy the Court that the verdict would necessarily have been the same if such error had not occurred. The satisfaction of this onus is a condition precedent to the right of the Appellate Court to apply the terms of the subsection at all. The Court is not bound to apply the subsection merely because this onus is discharged.\nThe section recognizes that there are cases in which, notwithstanding error on the part of the learned trial judge, the appeal court may in its discretion, where the weight of the evidence impels it to do so, conclude that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred. This is such a case. The evidence against the accused was overwhelming, and in my view the verdict would necessarily have been the same even if the jury had heard the opinion which Dr. Newman was prepared to give.\nI think that this is a proper case for the application of the provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii).

There is no reserve in the Northwest Territories. On an appeal by way of trial de novo to the Territorial Court, the re\u00adspondent was acquitted on the ground that s. 94(b) of the Indian Act has been rendered inoperative by the Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44, because it infringes the right of the respondent to equality before the law. Section 94(b) renders the respondent guilty of a punishable offence by reason of conduct which would not have been punishable if indulged in by any person who was not an Indian. The Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories affirmed the acquittal. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright C.J. and Abbott and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Fauteux, Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.: The opening words of s. 2 of the Cana\u00addian Bill of Rights afford the clearest indication that the section is intended to mean and does mean that if a law of Canada cannot be \"sensibly construed and applied\" so that it does not abrogate, abridge or infringe one of the rights and freedoms recog\u00adnized and declared by the Bill, then such law is inoperative \"unless it is expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights\". A declaration by the Courts that a section or a portion of a section of a statute is inoperative is to be dis\u00adtinguished from the repeal of such a section and is to be confined to the particular circumstances of the case in which the declaration is made. The word \"law\" as used in s. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights is to be construed as meaning \"the law of Canada\". An individual is denied equality before the law if it is made an offence punishable at law, on account of his race, for him to do something which his fellow Canadians are free to do without having committed any offence or having been made subject to any penalty. Section 94(b) of the Indian Act is a law of Canada which creates such an offence and it can only be construed in such manner that its application would operate so as to abrogate, abridge or infringe one of the rights declared and recognized by the Canadian Bill of Rights. Section 94(b) is therefore inoperative.\nThe fact that there are no reserves in the Territories is quite irrelevant.\nPer Hall J.: The concept that the Canadian Bill of Rights is operative in the face of a law of Canada only when that law does not give equality to all persons within the class to whom that particular law extends or relates, is to be rejected. The Canadian Bill of Rights can have validity and meaning only when subject to the single exception set out in s. 2 it is seen to repudiate discrimination in every law of Canada by reason of race, national origin, colour, religion or sex in respect of the human rights and fundamental freedoms set out in s. 1 in whatever way that discrimination may manifest itself not only as between Indian and Indian but as between all Canadians whether Indian or non-Indian.\nPer Cartwright C.J., dissenting: Section 94(b) of the Indian Act is not rendered inoperative by the terms of the Canadian Bill of Rights. The section is expressed in plain and unequivocal words and must be given effect according to its plain meaning. Parliament did not have the intention to confer the power and impose the responsibility upon the Courts of declaring inoperative ,any provision in a statute of Canada although expressed in clear and unequi\u00advocal terms, the meaning of which after calling in aid every rule of construction including that pre-scribed by s. 2 of the Bill is perfectly plain, if in the view of the Court it infringes any of the rights or freedoms declared by s. 1 of the Bill. The Cana\u00addian Bill of Rights directs the Courts to apply the laws of Canada not to refuse to apply them.\nPer Abbott J., dissenting: It would require the plainest words to impute to Parliament an inten\u00adtion that the Courts should engage in judicial legis\u00adlation as the interpretation of the Canadian Bill of Rights adopted by the Courts below necessarily im\u00adplies. No such intention is expressed in s. 2 of the Canadian Bill of Rights. On the contrary, with respect to existing legislation, the section provides merely a canon or rule of interpretation for such legislation.\nPer Pigeon J., dissenting: In respect of existing federal legislation, s. 2 of the Canadian Bill of Rights enacts a canon of construction and does not cast upon the Courts the task of removing there-from, whenever the question is raised, every provi\u00adsion that may be considered as being in conflict with the enumerated rights and freedoms. Equality before the law in the sense in which it was understood in the Courts below would require the Indians to be subject in every province to the same rules of law as all others in every particular not merely on the question of drunkenness.\nIf one of the effects of the Canadian Bill of Rights is to render inoperative all legal provisions whereby Indians as such are not dealt with in the same way as the general public, the conclusion is inescapable that Parliament, by the enactment of the Canadian Bill of Rights, has not only fundamentally altered the status of the Indians in that indirect fashion but has also made any future use of federal legislative authority over them subject to the requirement of expressly declaring every time \"that the law shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights\". It is very difficult to believe that Parliament so intended when enacting the Canadian Bill of Rights. Of themselves, the words in s. 2 \"be so construed and applied as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe\" do not enact something more than a rule of con\u00adstruction.\nOn the whole, one cannot find in the Canadian Bill of Rights anything clearly showing that Parlia\u00adment intended to establish concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms some overriding general principles to be enforced by the Courts against the clearly expressed will of Parliament in statutes exist\u00ading at the time. Parliament did nothing more than instruct the Courts to construe and apply those laws in accordance with the principles enunciated in the Canadian Bill of Rights on the basis that the recog\u00adnized rights and freedoms did exist, not that they were to be brought into existence by the Courts.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories[1], affirming the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of being unlawfully intoxicated off a reserve. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright C.J. and Abbott and Pigeon JJ. dissenting.\nD. H. Christie, Q.C., and C. D. MacKinnon, for the appellant.\nG. Brian Purdy, for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)\u2011The relevant facts, which are undisputed, and the course of the proceedings in the Courts below are set out in the reasons of my brothers Ritchie and Pigeon which I have had the advantage of reading.\nThere is no doubt that on the facts, the re\u00adspondent was guilty of a breach of s. 94(b) of the Indian Act and the question to be decided is whether that provision is rendered inoperative by the terms of the Canadian Bill of Rights, Statutes of Canada 8-9 Eliz. II, c. 44, hereinafter referred to as the Bill.\nIn approaching this question I will assume the correctness of the view that s. 94(b) infringes the right of the respondent to equality before the law declared by clause (b) of s. 1 of the Bill, in that because he is an Indian it renders him guilty of a punishable offence by reason of conduct which would not have been punishable if indulged in by any person who was not an Indian.\nThis is, I believe, the first occasion on which it has become necessary for this Court to decide this question. In Robertson and Rosetanni v. Her Majesty the Queen[2], the majority were of the view that the impugned provisions of The Lord's Day Act did not infringe the right to freedom of religion declared by clause (c) of s. 1 of the Bill, and consequently did not deal with the opinion which I expressed in my dissenting reasons as to the effect of the Bill on a provision of an Act of Parliament which does infringe one of the declared rights.\nIn the case at bar s. 94(b) of the Indian Act is expressed in plain and unequivocal words. It is not possible by the application of any rule of construction to give it a meaning other than that an Indian who is intoxicated off a reserve is guilty of an offence.\nIn these circumstances the choice open to us is to give effect to the section according to its plain meaning or to declare it inoperative, that is to say, to declare that the Indian Act is pro tanto repealed by the Bill.\nIn Robertson and Rosetanni v. The Queen, supra, I had to deal with a similar question as in my view The Lord's Day Act did infringe the freedom of religion. At pages 661 and 662 I used the following words:\nIt remains to consider the reasons for judgment of Davey LA. in Regina v. Gonzales (1962) 37 C.R. 56, 37 W.W.R. 257, 132 C.C.C. 237, 32 D.L.R. (2d) 290. At page 239 of the C.C.C. Reports the learned Justice of Appeal says:\nIn so far as existing legislation does not offend against any of the matters specifically mentioned in clauses (a) to (g) of s. 2, but is said to other-wise infringe upon some of the human rights and fundamental freedoms declared in s. 1, in my opinion the section does not repeal such legisla\u00adtion either expressly or by implication. On the contrary, it expressly recognizes the continued existence of such legislation, but provides that it shall be construed and applied so as not to dero\u00adgate from those rights and freedoms. By that it seems merely to provide a canon or rule of inter\u00adpretation for such legislation. The very language of s. 2, \"be so construed and applied as not to abrogate\" assumes that the prior Act may be sensibly construed and applied in a way that will avoid derogating from the rights and freedoms declared in s. 1. If the prior legislation cannot be so construed and applied sensibly, then the effect of s. 2 is exhausted, and the prior legislation must prevail according to its plain meaning.\nWith the greatest respect I find myself unable to agree with this view. The imperative words of s. 2 of the Canadian Bills of Rights, quoted above, appear to me to require the courts to refuse to apply any law, coming within the legislative authority of Parlia\u00adment, which infringes freedom of religion unless it is expressly declared by an Act of Parliament that the law which does so infringe shall operate notwith\u00adstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights. As already pointed out s. 5(2), quoted above, makes it plain that the Canadian Bill of Rights is to apply to all laws of Canada already in existence at the time it came into force as well as to those thereafter enacted. In my opinion where there is irreconcilable conflict between another Act of Parliament and the Canadian Bill of Rights the latter must prevail.\nWhether the imposition, under penal sanctions, of a certain standard of religious conduct on the whole population is desirable is, of course, a question for Parliament to decide. But in enacting the Canadian Bill of Rights Parliament has thrown upon the courts the responsibility of deciding, in each case in which the question arises, whether such an imposition in-fringes the freedom of religion in Canada. In the case at bar I have reached the conclusion that s. 4 of the Lord's Day Act does infringe the freedom of religion declared and preserved in the Canadian Bill of Rights and must therefore be treated as inopera\u00adtive.\nAfter a most anxious reconsideration of the whole question, in the light of the able arguments addressed to us by counsel, I have reached the conclusion that the view expressed by Davey J.A., as he then was, in the words quoted above is the better one.\nThe question is whether or not it is the inten\u00adsion of Parliament to confer the power and im\u00adpose the responsibility upon the courts of declaring inoperative any provision in a Statute of Canada although expressed in clear and une\u00adquivocal terms, the meaning of which after calling in aid every rule of construction including that prescribed by s. 2 of the Bill is perfectly plain, if in the view of the court it infringes any of the rights or freedoms declared by s. 1 of the Bill.\nIn approaching this question it must not be forgotten that the responsibility mentioned above, if imposed at all, is imposed upon every justice of the peace, magistrate and judge of any court in the country who is called upon to apply a Statute of Canada or any order, rule or regula\u00adtion made thereunder.\nIf it were intended that the question should be answered in the affirmative there would, in my opinion, have been added after the word \"declared\" in the seventh line of the opening paragraph of s. 2 of the Bill some such words as the following \"and if any law of Canada cannot be so construed and applied it shall be regarded as inoperative or pro tanto repealed\".\nWhat now appears to me to have been the error in my reasoning in the passage from Robertson and Rosetanni v. The Queen quoted above is found in the statement that the Bill requires the courts to refuse to apply any law of Canada which is successfully impugned as in-fringing one of the declared rights or freedoms whereas on the contrary, as Davey J.A. had pointed out, the Bill directs the courts to apply such a law not to refuse to apply it.\nFor these reasons I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Pigeon.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.\u2011This is an appeal brought with leave of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories3 dismissing an appeal by the Crown from a judg\u00adment of Mr. Justice W. G. Morrow of the Territorial Court of the Northwest Territories[3] by which he had acquitted Joseph Drybones of being \"unlawfully intoxicated off a reserve\" contrary to s. 94(b) of the Indian Act, R.S.C.1952, c. 149, after having heard an appeal by way of trial de novo from a judgment of Magistrate Anderson-Thompson who had convicted the respondent of this offence and sentenced him to be fined $10 and costs and in default to spend three days in custody. The full charge against Drybones was that he,\nOn or about the 8th of April, 1967 at Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories, being an Indian, was unlawfully intoxicated off a reserve, contrary to s. 94(0 of the Indian Act.\nThe respondent is an Indian and he was indeed intoxicated on the evening of April 8, 1967, on the premises of the Old Stope Hotel in Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories where there is no \"reserve\" within the meaning of the Indian Act.\nWhen he was first arraigned before Magistrate Anderson-Thompson, Drybones, who spoke no English, pleased guilty to this offence, but on appeal to the Territorial Court, Mr. Justice Morrow found that there was some serious doubt as to whether he fully appreciated his plea in the lower court and he was allowed to withdraw that plea whereafter the appeal proceeded as a trial de novo with a plea of not guilty. Section 94 of the Indian Act reads as follows:\n94. An Indian who\n(a) has intoxicants in his possession,\n(b) is intoxicated, or\n(c) makes or manufactures intoxicants off a re-serve, is guilty of an offence and is liable on sum\u00admary conviction to a fine of not less than ten dollars and not more than fifty dollars or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to both fine and imprisonment.\nI agree with the Court of Appeal that the use of the words \"off a reserve\" creates\n... an essential element to be proved in any charge laid under section 94. But once it is proved, as it was in the present case, that the offence was not committed upon a reserve, the requirement of the section was satisfied. The fact that there are no reserves in the Territories is quite irrelevant,\nThe important question raised by this appeal has its origin in the fact that in the Northwest Territories it is not an offence for anyone except an Indian to be intoxicated otherwise than in a public place. The Liquor Ordinance which is of general application in the Territories, (R.O.N. W.T. 1957, c. 60, s. 19(1)) provides that:\nNo person shall be in an intoxicated condition in a public place.... but unlike s. 94 of the Indian Act, there is no provision for a minimum fine and the maximum term of imprisonment is only 30 days as opposed to 3 months under the Indian Act.\nThe result is that an Indian who is intoxicated in his own home \"off a reserve\" is guilty of an offence and subject to a minimum fine of not less than $10 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 3 months or both, whereas all other citizens in the Territories may, if they see fit, be-come intoxicated otherwise than in a public place without committing any offence at all. And even if any such other citizen is convicted of being intoxicated in a public place, the only penalty provided by the Ordinance is \"a f i n e not exceed\u00ading $50 or ... imprisonment for a term not ex\u00adceeding 30 days or ... both fine and imprisonment.\"\nThe argument which was successfully advanced by the respondent before Mr. Justice Morrow and before the Court of Appeal was that because of this legislation, Indians in the Northwest Territories, by reason of their race, are denied \"equality before the law\" with their fellow Canadians, and that s. 94(b) of the Indian Act therefore authorizes the abrogation, abridgement or infringement of one of the human rights and fundamental freedoms recognized and declared as existing in Canada without discrimination by reason of race, pursuant to the provisions of the Canadian Bill of Rights, Statutes of Canada 8-9 Eliz. II, c. 44 (hereinafter sometimes referred to as \"The Bill of Rights\" or \"The Bill\") which provides, inter alia:\n1. It is hereby recognized and declared that in Canada there have existed and shall continue to exist without discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour, religion or sex, the following human rights and fundamental freedoms, namely,\n* * *\n(b) the right of the individual to equality before the law and the protection of the law;\n* * *\n2. Every law of Canada shall, unless it is expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied as not to abro\u00adgate, abridge or infringe, or to authorize the abrogation, abridgement or infringement of any of the rights or freedoms herein recognized and declared\n* * *\n5. (2) The expression 'law of Canada' in Part I means an Act of the Parliament of Canada enacted before or after the coming into force of this Act, any order, rule or regulation thereunder, and any law in force in Canada or in any part of Canada at the commencement of this Act that is subject to be repealed, abolished or altered by the Parliament of Canada.\nThe Court of Appeal agreed with Mr. Justice Morrow that s. 94(b) of the Indian Act is ren\u00addered inoperative by reason of this legislation and the Notice to appeal to this Court is limited to the single ground\nThat the Court of Appeal in the Northwest Ter\u00adritories in upholding the decision of the Territorial Court of the Northwest Territories erred in acquitting the respondent of \"an offence contrary to s. 94 (b) of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952 Ch. 149 on the ground that s. 94 of the Indian Act is rendered inoperative by reason of the Canadian Bill of Rights, Stat. Can. 1960 Ch. 44.\"\nIt was contended on behalf of the appellant that the reasoning and conclusion of the courts below make the question of whether s. 94 has been rendered inoperative by the Bill of Rights dependent upon whether or not the law of any province or territory makes it an offence to be intoxicated otherwise than in 'a public place and that its operation could therefore not only vary from place to place in Canada but also from time to time, depending upon amendments which might be made to the provincial or territorial legislation. I can, however, find no room for the application of this argument in the present case as the or\u00addinance in question is a law of Canada within the meaning of s. 5(2) of the Bill of Rights (see Northwest Territories Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 195, s. 17), and it is a law of general application in the Territories, whereas the Indian Act is, of course, also a law of Canada although it has special ap\u00adplication to Indians alone. The question of whether s. 94 of the Indian Act is rendered inoperative by reason of the pro-visions of the Bill of Rights on the ground that it abrogates, abridges or infringes the right of Canadians of the Indian race to \"equality before the law\" was considered by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in Regina v. Gonzale[4]', where Tysoe J.A., speaking for the majority of the Court, concluded that:\nSec. 94(a) of the Indian Act does not abrogate or infringe the right of the appellant to 'equality before the law' as I understand it. Sec. 2 of the Canadian Bill of Rights does not therefore affect it.\nIn reaching the same conclusion, Davey J.A., (as he then was) who wrote separate reasons for judgment from the other two members of the Court, took the view that s. 1 of the Bill of Rights should be treated as merely providing a canon of construction for the interpretation of legislation existing at the time when the statute was enacted. The learned judge said:\nIn so far as existing legislation does not offend against any of the matters specifically mentioned in clauses (a) to (g) of sec. 2, but is said to otherwise infringe upon some of the human rights and funda\u00admental freedoms declared in sec. 1, in my opinion the section does not repeal such legislation either expressly or by implication. On the contrary, it expressly recognizes the continued existence of such legislation, but provides that it shall be construed and applied so as not to derogate from those rights and freedoms. By that it seems merely to provide a canon or rule of interpretation for such legislation. The very language of sec. 2, '... be so construed and applied as not to abrogate ...' assumes that the prior Act may be sensibly construed and applied in a way that will avoid derogating from the rights and freedoms declared in sec. 1. If the prior legislation cannot be so construed and applied sensibly, then the effect of sec. 2 is exhausted, and the prior legislation must prevail according to its plain meaning.\nThe application of that rule of construction to existing legislation may require a change in the judicial interpretation of some statutes where the language permits and thus change the law. The difficulty with sec. 94(a) of the Indian Act is that it admits of no construction or application that would avoid conflict with sec. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights as appellant's counsel inter\u00adprets it. Since the effect of the Canadian Bill of Rights is not to repeal such legislation, it is the duty of the courts to apply sec. 94(a) in the only way its plain language permits, and that the learned magis\u00adtrate did when he convicted.\nThis proposition appears to me to strike at the very foundations of the Bill of Rights and to convert it from its apparent character as a statutory declaration of the fundamental human rights and freedoms which it recognizes, into being little more than a rule for the construction of federal statutes, but as this approach has found favour with some eminent legal commentators, it seems to me to be important that priority should be given to a consideration of it.\nI will hereafter refer to the case of Robertson and Rosetanni v. The Queen[5], but in the present context I mention it only to say that like the courts below I agree with what was said by the present Chief Justice in his dissenting reasons for judgment when commenting on the above view expressed by Mr. Justice Davey. He there said, at page 662:\nWith the greatest respect I find myself unable to agree with this view. The imperative words of s. 2 of the Canadian Bill of Rights, quoted above, appear to me to require the courts to refuse to apply any law, coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, which infringes freedom of religion unless it is expressly declared by an Act of Parliament that the law which does so infringe shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights. As already pointed out s. 5(2), quoted above, makes it plain that the Canadian Bill of Rights is to apply to all laws of Canada already in existence at the time it came into force as well as to those thereafter enacted. In my opinion where there is irreconcilable conflict between another Act of Parliament and the Canadian Bill of Rights the latter must prevail.\nI do not find that this expression of opinion in any way conflicts with the reasoning of the majority of this Court in Robertson and Rosetanni v. The Queen, supra, which held that there was no conflict between the impugned section of the Lord's Day Act and the Bill of Rights.\nI am, however, with respect, of the opinion that Mr. Justice Davey's reasoning is untenable on another ground. The result of that reasoning is to conclude that any law of Canada which can only be \"construed and applied sensibly\" so that it offends against the Bill of Rights, is to operate notwithstanding the provisions of that Bill. I am unable to reconcile this interpretation with the opening words of s. 2 where it is provided that:\nEvery law of Canada shall, unless it is expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied as not to abro\u00adgate ...\n(The italics are my own.)\nIf Mr. Justice Davey's reasoning were correct and the Bill of Rights were to be construed as meaning that all laws of Canada which clearly offend the Bill were to operate notwithstanding its provisions, then the words which I have italicized in s. 2 would be superfluous unless it be suggested that Parliament intended to reserve unto itself the right to exclude from the effect of the Bill of Rights only such statutes as are unclear in their meaning.\nIt seems to me that a more realistic meaning must be given to the words in question and they afford, in my view, the clearest indication that s. 2 is intended to mean and does mean that if a law of Canada cannot be \"sensibly construed and applied\" so that it does not abrogate, abridge or infringe one of the rights and freedoms recognized and declared by the Bill, then such law is in-operative \"unless it is expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights\".\nI think a declaration by the courts that a section or portion of a section of a statute is inoperative is to be distinguished from the repeal of such a section and is to be confined to the particular circumstances of the case in which the declara\u00adtion is made. The situation appears to me to be somewhat analogous to a case where valid provincial legislation in an otherwise unoccupied field ceases to be operative by reason of conflicting federal legislation.\nI think it is desirable at this stage to deal with the submission made on behalf of the appellant to the effect that the rights and freedoms recognized and declared by the Bill of Rights must have reference to and be circumscribed by the laws of Canada as they existed on the 10th of August, 1960, when the Bill was passed, which laws included s. 94 of the Indian Act. This sub-mission is based in large measure on the following paragraph from the reasons for judgment of this Court in Robertson and Rosetanni v. The Queen, supra, where it was said:\nIt is to be noted at the outset that the Canadian Bill of Rights is not concerned with 'human rights and fundamental freedoms' in any abstract sense but rather with such rights and freedoms as existed in Canada immediately before the statute was enacted (see also s. 5(1) ). It is therefore the 'religious freedom' then existing in this country that is safeguarded by the provisions of s. 2 ...\nWhat was at issue in that case was whether the Lord's Day Act, in providing that \"it shall be unlawful for any person on the Lord's Day ... to carry on or transact any business of his ordinary calling ... \" abrogated, abridged or infringed the right to \"freedom of religion\", and it was con-tended on behalf of the appellant that the phrase \"freedom of religion\" as used in the Bill of Rights meant \"freedom to enjoy the freedom which my own religion allows without being confined by restrictions imposed by Parliament for the purpose of enforcing the tenets of a faith to which I do not subscribe\". In considering this contention, it became necessary to examine the decided cases in order to determine what was the accepted meaning of \"freedom of religion\" as it existed in Canada immediately before the Bill of Rights was enacted and the last-quoted excerpt from the reasons for justment must, in my view, be read in this sense. This appears to me to be confirmed by the succeeding paragraph of these reasons where it is said:\nIt is accordingly of first importance to understand the concept of religious freedom which was recog\u00adnized in this country before the enactment of the Bill of Rights and after the enactment of the Lord's Day Act in its present form.\nIf it had been accepted that the right to \"freedom of religion\" as declared in the Bill of Rights was circumscribed by the provisions of the Ca\u00adnadian statutes in force at the date of its enactment, there would have been no need, in determining the validity of the Lord's Day Act to consider the authorities in order to examine the situation in light of the concept of religious freedom which was recognized in Canada at the time of the enactment of the Bill of Rights. It would have been enough to say that \"freedom of religion\" as used in the Bill must mean freedom of religion subject to the provisions of the Lord's Day Act. This construction would, however, have run contrary to the provisions of s. 5(2) of the Bill which makes it applicable to every \"Act of the Parliament of Canada enacted before or after the coming into force of this Act.\"\nIn any event, it was not necessary to decide this question in Robertson and Rosetanni because it was found that the impugned provisions of the Lord's Day Act and the Bill of Rights were not in conflict, and I accordingly do not consider that case to be any authority for the suggestion that the Bill of Rights is to be treated as being subject to federal legislation existing at the time of its enactment, and more particularly I do not con\u00adsider that the provisions of s. 1(b) of the Bill of Rights are to be treated as being in any way limited or affected by the terms of s. 94(b) of the Indian Act.\nThe right which is here at issue is \"the right of the individual to equality before the law and the protection of the law\". Mr. Justice Tysoe, who wrote the reasons for judgment on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in the Gonzales case, supra, expressed the opinion that as these words occur in the Bill of Rights they mean\nA right of every person to whom a particular law relates or extends, no matter what may be a person's race, national origin, colour, religion or sex, to stand on an equal footing with every other person to whom a particular law relates or extends and a right to the protection of the law.\n(The italics are Mr. Justice Tysoe's) Like the members of the courts below, I can-not agree with this interpretation pursuant to which it seems to me that the most glaring discriminatory legislation against a racial group would have to be construed as recognizing the right of each of its individual members \"to equality before the law\", so long as all the other members are being discriminated against in the same way.\nI think that the word \"law\" as used in s. 1(b) of the Bill of Rights is to be construed as mean\u00ading \"the law of Canada\" as defined in s. 5(2) (i.e. Acts of the Parliament of Canada and any orders, rules or regulations thereunder) and without attempting any exhaustive definition of \"equality before the law\" I think that s. 1(b) means at least that no individual or group of individuals is to be treated more harshly than another under that law, and I am therefore of opinion that an individual is denied equality be-fore the law if it is made an offence punishable at law, on account of his race, for him to do something which his fellow Canadians are free to do without having committed any offence or having been made subject to any penalty.\nIt is only necessary for the purpose of deciding this case for me to say that in my opinion s. 94(b) of the Indian Act is a law of Canada which creates such an offence and that it can only be construed in such manner that its appli\u00adcation would operate so as to abrogate, abridge or infringe one of the rights declared and recog\u00adnized by the Bill of Rights. For the reasons which I have indicated, I am therefore of opinion that s. 94( b) is inoperative.\nFor the purpose of determining the issue raised by this appeal it is unnecessary to express any opinion respecting the operation of any other section of the Indian Act.\nFor all the above reasons I would dismiss this appeal.\nSince writing the above I have had the advan\u00adtage of reading the reasons for judgment pre-pared by the Chief Justice and by Mr. Justice Pigeon which, when read together, appear to me to lead to the conclusion that, even on the as\u00adsumption that the application of the provisions of prior federal legislation has the effect of denying equality before the law, and thus discriminating against, a sector of the population \"by reason of race\", they must nevertheless be given full effect notwithstanding the provisions of the Bill of Rights. In view of this conclusion, I find it necessary to restate the position which I take in the matter.\nI am in full agreement with the Chief Justice that the question here raised was not decided in the case of Robertson and Rosetanni v. Her Majesty the Queen, supra, and that this is the first occasion on which it has become necessary for this Court to decide it.\nIn my view under the provisions of s. 1 of the Bill of Rights \"the right of the individual to equality before the law\" \"without discrimination by reason of race\" is recognized as a right which exists in Canada, and by ss. 2 and 5 of that Bill it is provided that every law of Canada enacted before or after the coming into force of the Bill, unless Parliament makes an express declaration to the contrary, is to be \"so construed and applied as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the abrogation, abridgement or infringement\" of any of the rights so recognized and declared.\nIt may well be that the implementation of the Canadian Bill of Rights by the courts can give rise to great difficulties, but in my view full effect must be given to the terms of s. 2 thereof.\nThe present case discloses laws of Canada which abrogate, abridge and infringe the right of an individual Indian to equality before the law and in my opinion if those laws are to be applied in accordance with the express language used by Parliament in s. 2 of the Bill of Rights, then s. 94(b) of the Indian Act must be declared to be inoperative.\nIt appears to me to be desirable to make it plain that these reasons for judgment are lim\u00adited to a 'situation in which, under the laws of Canada, it is made an offence punishable at law on account of race, for a person to do something which all Canadians who are not members of that race may do with impunity; in my opinion the same considerations do not by any means apply to all the provisions of the Indian Act. ABBOTT J. (dissenting)\u2011The relevant facts, which are undisputed, are set out in the reasons of my brothers Ritchie and Pigeon which I have had the advantage of reading.\nThe interpretation of the Bill of Rights, adopted by the courts below, necessarily implies a wide delegation of the legislative authority of Parlia\u00adment to the courts. The power to make such a delegation cannot be questioned but, in my view, it would require the plainest words to impute to Parliament an intention to extend to the courts, such an invitation to engage in judicial legisla\u00adtion. I cannot find that intention expressed in s. 2 of the Bill. On the contrary, I share the opinion expressed by the Chief Justice, by my brother Pigeon and by Davey J.A., as he then was, in the Gonzales case that, with respect to existing legislation, the section provides merely a canon or rule of interpretation for such legislation.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Pigeon.\nHALL J.\u2011I agree with the reasons of my brother Ritchie and wish only to add some ob\u00adservations regarding the decision in Regina v. Gonzales[6].\nThe concept that the Canadian Bill of Rights is operative in the face of a law of Canada only when that law does not give equality to all per-sons within the class to whom that particular law extends or relates, as it was expressed by Tysoe J.A. at p. 264:\nComing now to sec. 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights. The meaning of the word \"equality\" is well known. In my opinion, the word \"before\" in the expression \"equality before the law,\" in the sense in which that expression is used in sec. 1(b) means \"in the presence of.\" It seems to me this is the key to the correct interpretation of the expression and makes it clear that \"equality before the law\" has nothing to do with the application of the law equally to everyone and equal laws for everyone in the sense for which appellant's counsel contends, namely, the same laws for all persons, but to the position occupied by persons to whom a law relates or extends. They shall be entitled to have the law as it exists applied equally and without fear or favour to all persons to whom it relates or extends.\nis analogous to the position taken by the Supreme Court of the United States in Plessy v. Ferguson[7] and which was wholly rejected by the same Court in its historic desegregation judgment Brown v. Board of Education[8].\nIn Plessy v. Ferguson, the Court had held that under the \"separate but equal\" doctrine equality of treatment is accorded when the races are provided substantially equal facilities even though these facilities be separate. In Brown v. Board of Education, the Court held the \"separate but equal\" doctrine to be totally invalid.\nThe social situations in Brown v. Board of Education and in the instant case are, of course, very different, but the basic philosophic concept is the same. The Canadian Bill of Rights is not fulfilled if it merely equates Indians with Indians in terms of equality before the law, but can have validity and meaning only when subject to the single exception set out in s. 2 it is seen to repudiate discrimination in every law of Canada by reason of race, national origin, colour, reli\u00adgion or sex in respect of the human rights and fundamental freedoms set out in s. 1 in whatever way that discrimination may manifest itself not only as between Indian and Indian but as between all Canadians whether Indian or non-Indian.\nPIGEON J. (dissenting)\u2011The respondent is an Indian and the following charge was made against him before a magistrate in the Northwest Territories, namely that he,\nOn or about. the 8th of April, 1967 at Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories, being an Indian, was unlawfully intoxicated off a reserve, contrary to s. 94(b) of the Indian Act.\nRespondent pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a fine of $10 and costs. On his appeal to the Territorial Court, he was allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty. Having then pleaded not guilty, he raised the contention that s. 94(b) of the Indian Act has been rendered inoperative by the Canadian Bill of Rights (8-9 Eliz. 11, c. 44, hereinafter called the \"Bill\"). This contention was accepted by the Mr. Justice Morrow and the charge dismissed.\nOn appeal by the Crown to the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories[9], that Court refused to follow the contrary decision of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in Regina v. Gonzales[10] and affirmed the acquittal.\nThe Crown now appeals to this Court by special leave.\nThe question before us is essentially whether, in respect of existing federal legislation, Section 2 of the Bill enacts a canon of construction or casts upon the courts the task of removing there-from, whenever the question is raised, every pro-vision that may be considered as being in conflict with the enumerated rights and freedoms. In. thus stating the question I am not unmindful of the fact that, due to the definition in Section 5.2 of the expression \"law of Canada\", Section 2 applies to subsequent federal statutes equally as to exist\u00ading legislation. However, because different con\u00adsiderations may conceivably apply in the case of subsequent statutes, I find it desirable to go no further than necessary for the decision of the case at hand which has to do with existing legis\u00adlation.\nBefore considering any enacting clause I must note that the Bill is prefaced by a preamble, as follows :\nThe Parliament of Canada, affirming that the Canadian Nation is founded upon principles that acknowledge the supremacy of God, the dignity and worth of the human person and the position of the family in a society of free men and free institutions;\nAffirming also that men and institutions remain free only when freedom is founded upon respect for moral and spiritual values and the rule of law: And being desirous of enshrining these principles and the human rights and fundamental freedoms derived from them, in a Bill of Rights which shall reflect the respect of Parliament for its constitutional authority and which shall ensure the protection of these rights and freedoms in Canada:\nThen, after the enacting formula and the title \"Part I- Bill of Rights\", s. 1 is in the following terms :\n1. It is hereby recognized and declared that in Canada there have existed and shall continue to exist without discrimination by reason of race, na\u00adtional origin, colour, religion or sex, the following human rights and fundamental freedoms, namely,\n(a) the right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person and enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof except by due process of law;\n(b) the right of the individual to equality before the law and the protection of the law;\n(c) freedom of religion;\n(d) freedom of speech;\n(e) freedom of assembly and association; and\n(f) freedom of the press.\nIn considering the provisions just quoted, one must observe that the Bill itself begins by a solemn declaration by Parliament in the form of an enactment that, in Canada, the enumerated rights and freedoms \"have existed and shall con\u00adtinue to exist ... \". This statement is the essen\u00adtial element of the very first provision of the Bill and it is absolutely unqualified. It is the starting point of that legislation and I have great difficulty in reconciling it with the contention that in fact those rights and freedoms were not wholly and completely existing but were restricted by any number of statutory and other provisions in-fringing thereon.\nThere can be no doubt that in enacting legislation Parliament is presumed to be aware of the Late of the law (Walker v. The King[11]). A fortiori must it be so when the enactment itself has reference thereto. Where is the extent of exist\u00ading human rights and fundamental freedoms to be ascertained if not by reference to the statute books and other legislative instruments as well as to the decisions of the courts? It must also be considered that the rights and freedoms enumerated in s. 1 are not legal con\u00adcepts of precise and invariable content. If those words were to be taken by themselves, a great deal would be left undefined. However, by de\u00adclaring those rights and freedoms as they existed a large measure of precision was supplied. Is this not an important purpose of s. 1 and a very effective way of defining some key words of the enactment?\nIn the instant case, the question whether all existing legislation should be considered as in accordance with the non-discrimination principle cannot fail to come immediately to mind seeing that it arises directly out of head 24 of s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act whereby Parliament has exclusive legislative authority over \"Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians\". As was pointed out by Riddell J. in Rex v. Martin[12], this provision confers legislative authority over the Indians qua Indians and not otherwise. Its very object in so far as it relates to Indians, as opposed to Lands reserved for the Indians, is to enable the Parliament of Canada to make legislation applicable only to Indians as such and therefore not applicable to Canadian citizens generally .l This legislative authority is obviously intended to be exercised over matters that are, as regards persons other than Indians, within the exclusive legislative authority of the Provinces. Complete uniformity in provincial legislation is clearly not to be expected, not to mention the fact that further diversity must also result from special legislation for the territories. Equality before the law in the sense in which it was understood in the Courts below would require the Indians to be subject in every province to the same rules of law as all others in every particular not merely on the question of drunkenness. Outside the territories, provincial jurisdiction over education and health facilities would make it very difficult for federal authorities to provide such facilities to Indians without \"discrimination\" as understood in the Courts below. If one of the effects of the Canadian Bill of Rights is to render inoperative all legal pro-visions whereby Indians as such are not dealt with in the same way as the general public, the conclusion is inescapable that Parliament, by the enactment of the Bill, has not only funda\u00admentally altered the status of the Indians in that indirect fashion but has also made any future use of federal legislative authority over them subject to the requirement of expressly declaring every time \"that the law shall operate notwith\u00adstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights\". I find it very difficult to believe that Parliament so in-tended when enacting the Bill. If a virtual suppression of federal legislation over Indians as such was meant, one would have expected this important change to be made explicitly not sur\u00adreptitiously so to speak.\nIn s. 2, the crucial words are that every law of Canada shall, subject to the exception just noted, \"be so construed and applied as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe\" any of the rights and freedoms recognized and declared in the Bill. The question is whether those words enact something more than a rule of construction. Of themselves, it seems to me that they do not. Certainly the word \"construed\" implies nothing else. Does the word \"applied\" express a differ\u00adent intention? I do not think so and, even if this may appear a trite saying, I must point out that what respondent asks the Court to do and what the Courts below have effectively done is not to apply the statute, the Indian Act, but to decline to apply it.\nThe strongest argument against viewing s. 2 as a canon of construction is undoubtedly that the exception \"unless it is expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights\" is thereby deprived of any practical meaning. It cannot be denied that the operation of a rule of construction is not normally subject to such a qualification. On the contrary, the principle is that it has no effect against the clearly expressed will of Parliament in whatever form it is put. On the other hand, in seeking to give effect to some words in s. 2 that cannot for obvious reasons be applicable to any existing law, one must always bear in mind the very starting point of the Bill, namely that the rights and freedoms therein recognized are declared as existing, not as being introduced or expanded. If in s. 1 the act means what it says and recognizes and de\u00adclares existing rights and freedoms only, nothing more than proper construction of existing laws in accordance with the Bill is required to accom\u00adplish the intended result. There can never be any necessity for declaring any of them inop\u00aderative as coming in conflict with the rights and freedoms defined in the Bill seeing that these are declared as existing in them. Thus, it ap\u00adpears to me that s. 2 cannot be construed as suggested by respondent without coming in con\u00adflict with s. 1.\nIf, with respect to existing legislation, we had to choose between reading s. 1 as written and failing to adopt a construction of s. 2 that gives some meaningful effect to the exception, it seems to me that the choice should be in favour of giving paramount effect to s. 1. It is the pro-vision establishing the principle on which the whole act rests.\nAnother compelling reason is the presumption against implicit alteration of the law, Parliament must not be presumed to have intended to depart from the existing law any further than expressly stated (Maxwell, On Interpretation of Statutes, 9th ed., p. 84, cited in Duchesneau v. Cook[13]). In the present case, the judgments below hold in effect that Parliament in enacting the Bill has implicitly repealed not only a large part of the Indian Act but also the fundamental principle that the duty of the courts is to apply the law as written and they are in no case authorized to fail to give effect to the clearly expressed will of Parliament. It would be a radical departure from this basic British constitutional rule to enact that henceforth the courts are to declare inoperative all enactments that are considered as not in con\u00adformity with some legal principles stated in very general language, or rather merely enumerated without any definition.\nThe meaning of such expressions as \"due proc\u00adess of law\", \"equality before the law\", \"freedom of religion\", \"freedom of speech\", is in truth largely unlimited and undefined. According to in\u00addividual views and the evolution of current ideas, the actual content of such legal concepts is apt to expand and to vary as is strikingly apparent in other countries. In the traditional British system that is our own by virtue of the B.N.A. Act, the responsibility for updating the statutes in this changing world rests exclusively upon Parlia\u00adment. If the Parliament of Canada intended to depart from that principle in enacting the Bill, one would expect to find clear language ex-pressing that intention. On the contrary, what do we find in s. 1 but an apparent desire to adhere to the traditional principle and to avoid the uncertainties inherent in broadly worded enactments by tying the broad words to the large body of existing law and in effect declaring the recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms to be as existing in the laws of Canada.\nI fail to see how it can be considered that by taking this to be the fundamental intention, the apparent character of the Bill is not fully recog\u00adnized. I also fail to see how it can be said that to read s. 2 as little more than a rule of construction is to fail to give effect to the Bill. On what basis is it assumed that anything else was intended in an act that is not of a constitutional character?\nThat canons of construction are of less im\u00adportance than constitutional rules does not mean that they are of minimal importance. For instance, in our legal system, the rule against retrospective operation of enactments as well as the principle that a criminal offence requires means rea are nothing more than canons of construction. It certainly does not mean that they are of secondary importance. Decisions such as Beaver v. The Queen[14], The Queen v. King[15] clearly show how far-reaching such principles are. If the Canadian Parliament should consider it desirable to en-shrine them in a statute, would it be contended that those who subsequently read it as not alter\u00ading their fundamental nature and letting them remain canons of construction are failing to give it effect?\nOn the whole, I cannot find in the Canadian Bill of Rights anything clearly showing that Parliament intended to establish concerning hu\u00adman rights and fundamental freedoms some overriding general principles to be enforced by the courts against the clearly expressed will of Parliament in statutes existing at the time. In my opinion, Parliament did nothing more than in\u00adstruct the courts to construe and apply those laws in accordance with the principles enunciated in the Bill on the basis that the recognized rights and freedoms did exist, not that they were to be brought into existence by the courts.\nFor those reasons I would allow the appeal, reverse the judgments of the Court of Appeal and of the Territorial Court of the Northwest Territo\u00adries, and re-establish the conviction and sentence. In view of the terms of the order granting leave to appeal, it is presumed that suitable arrange\u00adments have been made for the costs of re-presentation of the respondent and therefore, no order requires to be made in that regard.\nSince writing the above I have had the ad-vantage of reading the reasons of the Chief Justice and I wish to add that I agree with his observations entirely.\nAppeal dismissed, Cartwright C.J. and Abbott and Pigeon JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D.

(a) of Schedule V of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 100, and as such are subject to the lower rate of sales tax imposed by s. 32(3) of the Act. The Tariff Board agreed with that contention, but its declaration was set aside by the Exchequer Court. The Commission appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Pigeon J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: Taking the words \u201cmanufacture\u201d and \u201cproduction\u201d in their natural and ordinary sense, there is nothing in the Excise Tax Act which would compel to give them the restrictive meaning of \u201cgeneration\u201d, when applied to electricity. The Tariff Board correctly construed para. (a) of Schedule V and did not misdirect itself as to the law. There was ample evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding of fact that the transformers are for use \u201cdirectly in the manufacture of goods\u201d. Under s. 57 of the Act, such a finding is not subject to judicial review. Per Pigeon J., dissenting: Uncontradicted evidence shows that in usual language a transformer is never designated as used in the production of electricity, but as used in its transmission or distribution. The Tariff Board erred in law in construing and applying para. (a) of Schedule V otherwise than by reference to the usual meaning of the word \u201cproduction\u201d as applied to electricity and in giving precedence over common usage to the scientist\u2019s or technician\u2019s view of the use of transformers. In order to give effect to the intention of Parliament to limit the exemption to things used in the production of goods as opposed to things used in their transportation or distribution, account must be taken of the distinction made everywhere between the production of electricity that is effected only in power-houses and its transmission and distribution that are effected through a network of transformers connected by cables.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Jackett P. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], in a matter under the Excise Tax Act. Appeal allowed, Pigeon J. dissenting.\nHon. C. H. Locke, Q.C., and J.M. Coyne, Q.C., for the appellant.\nC.R.O. Munro, Q.C., and D. H. Aylen, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by\nABBOTT J.\u2014This appeal is from a judgment of the Exchequer Court1 which allowed an appeal under s. 58 of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 100, as amended, by the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Customs and Excise from a decision of the Tariff Board. The question of law, upon which leave to appeal was granted, is framed in the following terms:\nDid the Tariff Board err as a matter of law in deciding that the transformers in issue are \u201cmachinery and apparatus sold to or imported by manufacturers or producers for use by them directly in the manufacture or production of goods\u201d within the meaning of paragraph (a) of Schedule V of the Excise Tax Act? The dispute arises under the Excise Tax Act and concerns the rate of sales tax payable under that Act upon certain transformers purchased and used by the appellant. The issue turns upon whether or not the transformers are \u201cmachinery and apparatus sold to or imported by manufacturers or producers for use by them directly in the manufacture or production of goods\u201d within the meaning of para. (a) of Schedule V of the said Act. If they are, then they are subject to the lower rate of tax imposed by s. 32(3) rather than the higher rate imposed generally upon goods by s. 30(1).\nIt is common ground that \u201celectricity\u201d falls within the meaning of the word \u201cgoods\u201d in the relevant provisions of the Excise Tax Act and that the appellant is a \u201cmanufacturer or producer of goods\u201d for the purposes of the same provisions.\nThe function of the transformers in question is described by the Tariff Board in its declaration, as follows:\nThe applicant\u2019s principal business is the manufacture or production and the sale of electricity to municipalities, industries and individuals. The electricity sold to the customers is measured, by an appropriate meter, in kilowatt hours; for lighting and ordinary appliances, the electricity is generally sold to customers at 120-240 volts, though many customers, particularly municipalities and industries, may purchase electricity at considerably higher voltages.\nThe evidence reveals that, at its generating stations, the applicant produces electricity from a source of energy that is not electricity, for example water power or thermal energy; the electrical power generated at these stations is usually generated at a voltage considerably higher than that used by the applicant\u2019s household customers and lower than that used by some of its other customers; for purposes of transmission over distances, the voltage of the electric power delivered by the generator is almost invariably transformed to a much higher voltage; at this very high voltage electric power is generally not of use to the great majority of the applicant\u2019s customers; consequently, it is usually transformed to a lower voltage, frequently at one or more substations, and, in any event, at some point in the system in the proximity of the consuming customer, to the voltage normally purchased by him. Though this is the pattern for the greatest number of consumers, there are certain customers who require high voltages, for their purposes the electricity may be transformed to higher instead of lower voltages or, in very exceptional cases, there could be direct transmission from a generating station to such customers without any transformation.\nThe transformation of voltage, upwards or downwards, is performed by a device known as a transformer.\nThe appellant took the position that transformers used by it for the purposes described in that portion of the declaration of the Tariff Board, which I have quoted, are so used \u201cdirectly in the manufacture or production of goods\u201d and requested a ruling that the transformers in question were subject to the lower rate of tax imposed by s. 32(3) of the Excise Tax Act.\nThe appellant\u2019s request was rejected by the Deputy Minister on the following grounds:\nWhen the electricity leaves the generating station and enters the distribution system, the production process has ceased and, in our view, machinery and apparatus used beyond this point does not qualify as production machinery or apparatus. All transformers and ancillary equipment used beyond the generating station for transforming the electricity to voltage levels required by customers is subject to sales tax at the rate of 12%.\nPursuant to the provisions of s. 57 of the said Act, an appeal was taken by appellant to the Tariff Board, requesting the Board to make a declaration as to the tax which was payable on the said transformers.\nEvidence concerning the business of the appellant, the nature of electricity, the purpose and function of the transformers and other relevant matters was heard by the Tariff Board which, in its declaration, made certain findings, amongst them the following:\nFrom the evidence it appears that the current in the primary coil of a transformer is electrically insulated from the core of the transformer and from the secondary winding of the transformer. By electromagnetic induction, initiated by the electrical energy of the primary alternating current, a new and sepa- rate alternating current is produced in the secondary winding of a transformer. The current in the secondary circuit usually differs, not in the number of watts or of cycles, but in the number of volts and of amperes. However the operation of a transformer is no mere transmission in the sense of causing the primary current to pass, go or be conveyed or conducted from the primary circuit to the secondary circuit.\n* * *\nThe electrical energy produced by the applicant is not a commodity which is ordinarily used by or sold to its customers until it has been transformed; it exists, prior to such transformation, in a form which is not generally marketable because it is unsuited for the use of most customers.\n* * *\nBecause it is the transformation in issue that turns the electrical energy into a form that can be used by the customer, this transformation must be considered to be part of the manufacture and production of electricity. Because the transformation of voltage is done exclusively in the transformers and by the transformers, they are apparatus sold to or imported by the applicant for use by it directly in the manufacture or production of goods.\nThe principal contention of the respondent before the Tariff Board, the Exchequer Court and this Court was that the words \u201cmanufacture or production\u201d, when applied to a commodity such as electricity, must be construed to mean manufacture or production in the sense of \u201cgeneration\u201d. That contention was rejected by the Tariff Board, but was accepted by the learned President of the Exchequer Court.\nAs Duff C.J. stated in The King v. Vandeweghe Limited[2]: \u201cThe words \u2018manufacture\u2019 and \u2018production\u2019 are not words of any precise meaning and, consequently, we must look to the context for the purpose of ascertaining their meaning and application in the provisions we have to construe.\u201d Nevertheless, taking these words in their natural and ordinary sense, there is nothing in the Excise Tax Act which would compel such a restrictive meaning as that contended for by the respondent. Moreover such a meaning would be contrary to evidence which was accepted by the Board. In my opinion the Board correctly construed para. (a) of Schedule V of the Excise Tax Act, and did not misdirect itself as to the law.\nThe Board found as a fact that the transformers in issue in this appeal are \u201capparatus sold to or imported by the appellant for use by it directly in the manufacture of goods\u201d. There was ample evidence to support that finding and, under the provisions of s. 57 of the Excise Tax Act, it is not subject to judicial review.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Exchequer Court and restore the declaration of the Tariff Board. The appellant is entitled to its costs throughout.\nPIGEON J. (dissenting)\u2014Under the Excise Tax Act, sales tax was, until March 31, 1968, payable at a reduced rate on items listed in Schedule V. Paragraph (a) of that schedule reads as follows:\n(a) machinery and apparatus sold to or imported by manufacturers or producers for use by them directly in the manufacture or production of goods.\nAppellant contends that the transformers it uses in connection with the production and distribution of electricity are apparatus used \u201cdirectly in the manufacture or production of goods\u201d within the meaning of that provision. The Tariff Board agreed with that contention. On appeal, the President of the Exchequer Court[3] set aside that declaration as ill-founded in law, hence this appeal.\nIt is conceded that electricity is \u201cgoods\u201d within the meaning of the Act in question because it is listed in para. 3, Part VI, Schedule III in which goods exempt from sales tax are enumerated. The whole question to be determined is therefore whether transformers should be considered as used in the \u201cproduction\u201d of electricity. It is not suggested that the word \u201cmanufacture\u201d is applicable. As Duff C.J. pointed out in The King v. Vandeweghe Ltd.[4], the words \u201cproduced\u201d and \u201cmanufactured\u201d are not words of any very precise meaning and, consequently, we must look to the context for the purpose of ascertaining their meaning. In this case, it seems to me, the context clearly shows that Parliament has established a distinction based on the main categories of economic activities generally recognized. A reduced rate of sales tax or a complete exemption (depending on the date), has been provided for apparatus used directly in the production of goods, but this privilege does not extend to what is used in transportation or distribution. Paragraph (d) of Schedule V mentions equipment \u201cfor use\u2026 in carrying refuse or waste from machinery and apparatus\u201d used in the manufacture or production of goods. This clearly indicates that, generally speaking, transportation equipment is not within the exemption. Similarly, in para. (e), trucks used exclusively off-highway at mines and quarries are mentioned, and in para. (f), internal combustion tractors for use in the operation of logging such operation to include only the removal of the log from the stump to a regular carrier.\nCounsel for appellant relies essentially on the fact that in a transformer the coils carrying the electricity are insulated from each other so that the electric current coming out of it is not the same current that entered it. The alternating current coming out of a transformer is ordinarily of a voltage different from that of the current entering it and it is contended that this transformation gives to the commodity the form in which it is delivered to the customer. A witness went so far as to assert that technically or scientifically it could be said that a transformer \u201cproduces\u201d electricity. Perhaps that could be said, but the fact is that it is never said and the reason it is not said is that, in usual language, the operation is considered from an economic standpoint and what is called \u201cproduction of electricity\u201d is only production of electrical energy from another source of energy.\nUncontradicted evidence shows that in usual language a transformer is never designated as an apparatus used in the production of electricity, but as an apparatus used in its transmission or distribution. It is true that, due to its special nature, electrical energy cannot ordinarily be transported and distributed without being transformed up and down and this is done by producing, through induction in transformers, a new current. However, because electricity is generated in the form of alternating current precisely to facilitate such transformations, such changes in voltage are not considered as part of the operation \u201cproduction of electricity\u201d but they are looked upon as an essential step in the transmission and distribution. This is how the expression \u201cproduction of electricity\u201d is understood in common parlance.\nSuch is the criterion by which the Tariff Board should have been governed in its declaration. To construe and apply the law, it did not have to consider how the use of transformers is to be viewed from a scientific or technical standpoint. It had to ascertain how that use is considered and described in usual language. Under a well established rule of construction, laws must not be construed by reference to scientific or technical theories, but according to the usual meaning of the words (Continental Soya Co. Ltd. v. J.R. Short Milling Co. (Canada) Ltd.[5]; Laboratoire Pentagone Limit\u00e9e v. Parke Davis & Co.[6]).\nIn my opinion, the Board erred in law in construing and applying para. (a) of Schedule V of the Excise Tax Act otherwise than by reference to the usual meaning of the word \u201cproduction\u201d as applied to electricity and in giving precedence over common usage to the scientist\u2019s or technician\u2019s view of the use of transformers. The common view expressed in the usual language should have prevailed.\nIn order to give effect to the intention of Parliament to limit the exemption in question to things used in the production of goods as opposed to things used in their transportation or distribution, account must be taken of the distinction made everywhere between the production of electricity that is effected only in power-houses and its transmission and distribution that are effected through a network of transformers connected by cables.\nI am not overlooking the cases in which it was held that giving a commodity the form required to make it acceptable to the customer is an essential part of production irrespective of the extent of such transformation (The Queen v. York Marble Tile and Terrazzo Ltd.[7]). This principle cannot be applied beyond what is understood to be production of goods in the usual meaning of the term. In all the cases where this principle was applied, be it to marble, furs, watches or anything else, there always was \u201cproduction\u201d of an article of trade in the usual sense. This is what is lacking in the instant case.\nI must add that, even from a technical or scientific point of view, it seems to me that the President of the Exchequer Court correctly found that the Tariff Board was in error. Indeed, I incline to think that he is right in saying that in Schedule V of the Excise Tax Act \u201celectricity\u201d means \u201celectrical energy\u201d because what the appellant sells is measured in kilowatt-hours, a unit of energy. Therefore, it is the electrical energy that is sold and delivered, not the current whereby it is transmitted. However, I am not sure that this aspect of the question is a point of law. On the other hand, it seems obvious to me that the meaning to be given to the provision to be applied in this case is exclusively a question of law (Canadian Lift Truck v. Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Customs and Excise.[8]).\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, PIGEON J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Herridge, Tolmie, Gray, Coyne & Blair, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.

It was conclusively proved that her death was caused by arsenical poisoning and that she had ingested quantities of arsenic throughout a period of several months prior to her death. This was not contested by the defence. The first day of the trial, after the evidence of one Crown witness had been heard, counsel for the appellant tendered a formal written admission of facts and asked that this be received pursuant to s. 562 of the Criminal Code. The Crown objected to the inclusion of one of these facts. The trial judge did not permit the admission of the fact in question. The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge should have permitted the admission but that the error had caused no prejudice to the appellant and that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred. The appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe trial judge was not in error. In a criminal case, an accused cannot admit a fact alleged against him until the allegation has been made. When recourse is proposed to be added to s. 562, it is for the Crown, not for the defence, to state the fact or facts which it alleges against the accused and of which it seeks admission. The accused, of course, is under no obligation to admit the fact so alleged but his choice is to admit or to decline to do so. He cannot frame the wording of the allegation to suit his own purposes and then insist on admitting it. The idea of the admission of an allegation involves action by two persons, one who makes the allegation and another who admits it.\nThe reasons of Bull J.A. of the Court of Appeal on all the other grounds of appeal urged in the Court of Appeal and before this Court, should be adopted.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the appellant\u2019s conviction for capital murder. Appeal dismissed.\nC.R. MacLean, for the appellant.\nW.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014This is an appeal from the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1, pronounced on July 19, 1968, dismissing the appellant\u2019s appeal from his conviction before Dryer J. and a jury on October 6, 1967, of the capital murder of his wife.\nEsther Castellani, the wife of the appellant, died on July 11, 1965. It was conclusively proved by medical and scientific testimony that her death was caused by arsenical poisoning and that she had ingested quantities of arsenic throughout a period of several months prior to her death. That this was the fact was not contested by the defence. The question for the jury was whether they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the poison had been administered to her by the appellant. The learned trial Judge rightly instructed the jury that only two verdicts were open to them, \u201cNot Guilty\u201d or \u201cGuilty of Capital Murder\u201d.\nThe grounds of appeal relied upon by the appellant in the Court of Appeal are accurately summarized as follows in the reasons of Norris J.A. and of Bull J.A.:\n1. The learned trial Judge erred in refusing to allow the appellant or his counsel to admit at the trial certain facts under Section 562 of the Criminal Code.\n2. The learned trial Judge erred in law in not ordering certain portions of the address to the jury by the appellant\u2019s counsel to be read to the jury when the jury so requested.\n3. The learned trial Judge misdirected the jury by:\n(a) failing to adequately deal with the evidence given by Mrs. Sheila Luond, and\n(b) after having the evidence of Mrs. Sheila Luond read to the jury as it requested, made references to certain facts which were not in evidence, thereby suggesting that a prejudicial inference could be drawn therefrom, and not correcting that error until the next day just before the verdict was delivered, and\n(c) creating a prejudicial effect by the combination of (a) and (b) above.\n4. In view of the circumstantial nature of the evidence, the jury could not have given proper weight to the direction of the learned trial Judge as to the rule in Hodge\u2019s case (1838) 2 Lewin 227, 168 E.R. 1136, or the doctrine of reasonable doubt, and so its verdict was perverse or unreasonable.\nAs to the first of these grounds, it appears that on September 25, 1967, the first day of the trial, after the evidence of one Crown witness had been heard, counsel for the appellant tendered a formal written admission, of facts \u201cfor the purpose of freeing the Crown of the responsibility for proving same\u201d and asked that this be received pursuant to s. 562 of the Criminal Code which reads as follows:\n562. Where an accused is on trial for an indictable offence he or his counsel may admit any fact alleged against him for the purpose of dispensing with proof thereof.\nThe document tendered consisted of eight paragraphs; following the style of cause it read as follows:\nPursuant to the provisions of section 562 of the Criminal Code of Canada, Counsel for Rene Emile Castellani hereby admit the following facts:\u2014\n1. That at the Vancouver General Hospital, in the City of Vancouver in the County of Vancouver, in the Province of British Columbia, on July 12th, 1965, an autopsy was performed by Dr. Frank H. Anderson on the body of Esther Castellani, deceased.\n2. That on July 14th, 1965, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Municipality of Burnaby, in the Province of British Columbia, the body of Ester Castellani, deceased, was buried in a casket placed in a closed cement crypt.\n3. That on August 3rd, 1965, the body of Esther Castellani, deceased, was exhumed from the cement crypt of Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Municipality of Burnaby, and delivered to the morgue in the City of Vancouver where a post\u2011mortem examination was conducted by Dr. Thomas Redo Harmon.\n4. That control specimens of embalming fluid from the same source as were used by the undertakers who embalmed the body of Esther Castel- lani, deceased and who buried her, namely Simmons & McBride Ltd. of the City of Vancouver, were delivered to Eldon Rideout at the City of Vancouver on August 3rd, 1965.\n5. That on July 28th, 1965, at the Broadway and Cambie Branch of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in the City of Vancouver, Rene Emile Castellani signed a certain application for a loan form from Kinross Mortgage Corporation, in the presence of Mr. R.S. Keyes.\n6. That no action or proceeding for dissolution of the marriage between Rene Emile Castellani and Esther Castellani, which marriage was solemnized on July 16th, 1946, was ever commenced in any Court having jurisdiction to hear such an action.\n7. That scientific tests known as X-ray diffraction procedures were done by Mrs. Thomson at the Ontario Attorney-General\u2019s Crime Detection Laboratory, in an effort to determine from the hair samples removed from the body of Esther Castellani what salt or compound the arsenic had originated from, but the results were inconclusive because there was not a sufficient quantity of hair.\n8. That Rene Emile Castellani and Adelaide Miller mutually engaged in an extra\u2011marital sexual relationship from approximately the Fall of A.D., 1964 to the Spring of A.D., 1966.\nIt was dated September 25, 1967, and signed by both of the counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial.\nCounsel for the Crown objected and the question was adjourned to the following day for argument. During the adjournment counsel for both parties agreed that the first seven paragraphs should be admitted but Crown counsel objected to the inclusion of para. 8 while counsel for the appellant insisted that under s. 562 he had the right to make that admission and intended to do so.\nFollowing argument in the absence of the jury the learned trial Judge, after expressing regret that counsel for the Crown had not seen fit to accept the admissions as tendered, ruled that while the Crown\u2019s case was being put in the defence did not have the right to make an admission unless the Crown were willing to accept it. Later the admission consisting of the seven paragraphs was signed and filed with the consent of both parties but counsel for the appellant maintained that they had the right to insist on also making the admission contained in para. 8.\nThe Court of Appeal were of the view that the learned trial Judge should have permitted the admission set out in para. 8 to be made, interpreting the words of s. 562 as giving the accused an unqualified right to make an admission of any fact alleged against him. They held therefore that the learned trial Judge had erred in law but went on to hold that the error had caused no prejudice to the appellant and that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred. If I were in agreement with the Court of Appeal that the learned trial Judge had erred in law in the manner stated I would also have agreed with their conclusion that this occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice; but, with respect, I do not agree that the learned trial Judge was in error in the ruling which he made.\nIn a criminal case, there being no pleadings, there are no precisely worded allegations of fact which are susceptible of categorical admission. An accused cannot admit a fact alleged against him until the allegation has been made. When recourse is proposed to be had to s. 562 it is for the Crown, not for the defence, to state the fact or facts which it alleges against the accused and of which it seeks admission. The accused, of course, is under no obligation to admit the fact so alleged but his choice is to admit it or to decline to do so. He cannot frame the wording of the allegation to suit his own purposes and then insist on admitting it. To permit such a course could only lead to confusion. The idea of the admission of an allegation involves action by two persons, one who makes the allegation and another who admits it.\nI have formed the above opinion as to the meaning and effect of s. 562, simply from a consideration of its words and of what is necessarily involved in the notion of an admission of an allegation of fact in a criminal case. If it were necessary to have recourse to rules of construction my view would be strengthened by the application of the rules set out by Lord Coke in Heydon\u2019s Case[2]. It seems reasonably clear that before the enactment of s. 690 in the Criminal Code, 1892, the predecessor of s. 562, an accused on his trial for felony could not be allowed to make an admission in court although he desired to do so and counsel for the Crown was willing to accept it. This is indicated in the following passage in the report of the Commissioners who prepared the English draft code in 1879, which is quoted in Taschereau\u2019s Criminal Code (1893), 3rd ed. at p. 800:\nAt present if the accused is proved before his trial to have made an admission it is evidence against him, but though he offers to make the same admission in court it is thought that in cases of felony the judge is obliged to refuse to let him do so.\nThe same view as to the common law rule was expressed by Osler J.A. giving the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Regina v. St. Clair[3] as follows:\n\u2026 Under the former convenient classification of crimes as felonies and misdemeanours, the abolition of which, I think for my own part, is much to be regretted, such a charge was a misdemeanour simply and the competency of the accused or her counsel to make admissions at the trial for the purposes of the trial was undoubted.\nIn Rex v. Foster (1836), 7 C. & P. 495, on an indictment for felony for having in his possession a mould for the purpose of coining, the prisoner was acquitted; a second indictment for a related felony was then presented, the evidence on which was to be the same as in the former case. Counsel for the prosecution said that with the assent of the prisoner\u2019s counsel he proposed not to call the witnesses again. Patteson, J., said he doubted if that could be done, even by consent, in a case of felony, though he knew it might be in a case of misdemeanour. The witnesses were, therefore, recalled and resworn, and the evidence they had given read over to them from the Judge\u2019s notes.\nIn my opinion the purpose of enacting s. 562 and its predecessors was to alter the common law rule by eliminating the necessity, on the trial of an indictable offence, of proof by the Crown of any fact which it desires to prove and which the accused is prepared to admit at his trial.\nOn all the other grounds of appeal urged in the Court of Appeal and before us I find myself so fully in agreement with the reasons of Bull J.A. that I am content simply to adopt them. Nothing would be gained by repeating or summarizing what he has said. Each of the learned Justices of Appeal performed the duty placed upon the Court of Appeal by s. 583A(3) of the Criminal Code and could find no grounds in the record other than those alleged in the notice of appeal upon which the conviction ought to be set aside.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Kincaid, Epstein & MacLean, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Boyd, King & Toy, Vancouver.\n[1] (1968), 65 W.W.R. 513, [1969] 1 C.C.C. 327.\n[2] (1584), 3 Co.

Ottewell, Ella Hamilton, Arthur Ottewell, Jennie Smith, George Ottewell, Sylvia Carruthers, Alberta Ottewell, Linda Milligan, John Devereux Respondents.\n1969: November 4; 1969: December 17.\nPresent: Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION\nWills\u2014Gift to X and his heirs\u2014Mixed realty and personalty\u2014Whether words of limitation or substitution.\nIn their respective wills, Frank Clinton Ottewell and his brother, Fred S. Ottewell, named each other as residuary legatee. The will of Frank was in the same words mutatis mutandis as the will of Fred. Fred predeceased Frank by some two and one-half years and his estate, consisting entirely of personalty, went to his brother. The testator Frank died leaving an estate of mixed personalty and realty.\nThe appellant was the only daughter and sole next-of-kin of Fred. The respondents (together with the appellant) were Frank\u2019s next-of-kin entitled to take on an intestacy. In claiming the whole of the residue of Frank\u2019s estate, the appellant contended that the concluding words of the residuary clause\u2014\u201cto hold unto him, his heirs, executors and administrators absolutely and forever\u201d were words of substitution not of limitation. The Chambers judge and the majority in the Appellate Division held that the said words were words of limitation, and, accordingly, denied the appellant\u2019s claim.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe words of the will in question had long been held to be words of limitation not of substitution. Their insertion was no longer necessary to confer an absolute interest in realty and they were inapt in a bequest of personalty; but this circumstance did not alter their character or effect. The rule that a limitation of personal estate to one and his heirs operates to vest in the person named an absolute interest was equally applicable where the property given consists of mixed realty and personalty.\nThe meaning of the will was clear; it contained no patent ambiguity; if the facts surrounding its execution were considered they did not disclose any latent ambiguity and they were consequently irrelevant.\nIn re McElligott; Grant v. McElligott, [1944] Ch. 216 at 219, applied.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division[1], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Milvain C.J. Appeal dismissed.\nA.G. Macdonald, Q.C., for the appellant.\nP.M. Owen, Q.C., and G.D. Lavall\u00e9e, Q.C., for the respondents.\nB.D. Patterson, for the executors.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta1, delivered on July 23, 1969, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Milvain C.J. pronounced on November 27, 1968; Porter J.A., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal.\nThe application before Milvain C.J. was to construe the will of the late Frank Clinton Ottewell, who died on December 30, 1967, leaving an estate consisting of realty valued at $158,000 and personalty valued at $194,661.14, and to determine the beneficiaries entitled to take the residue of the estate.\nThe will is a simple one; it reads as follows:\nTHIS IS THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT of me, FRANK CLINTON OTTEWELL, of Clover Bar, in the Province of Alberta. I HEREBY REVOKE all Wills and testamentary dispositions of every nature or kind whatsoever by me heretofore made.\nI NOMINATE, CONSTITUTE AND APPOINT Guy Patterson and Bruce D. Patterson, or the survivor, to be the Executors and Trustees of this my Will and I hereinafter refer to them as my Trustees.\nTo the Clover Bar United Church I leave the proceeds of my insurance policy which I hold with the Mutual Life in the sum of Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00). The said proceeds shall be used by the said Clover Bar United Church as they shall see fit.\nI GIVE, DEVISE AND BEQUEATH unto my brother, Fred S. Ottewell, the balance and residue of all my estate, both real and personal, whatsoever and wheresoever found or situate, to hold unto him, his heirs, executors and administrators absolutely and forever.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF I, the said FRANK CLINTON OTTEWELL, the Testator, have to this my last Will and Testament set my hand this 19th day of June, A.D. 1957.\nThere follows an attestation clause in the usual form, one of the witnesses being Bruce D. Patterson.\nThe question raised is as to the true meaning and effect of the residuary clause, Fred S. Ottewell having died on June 15, 1965, and so predeceased the testator. The appellant who is the only daughter and sole next-of-kin of Fred S. Ottewell claims the whole of the residue. The respondents claim that the residue should be divided amongst the next-of-kin of the testator and if this contention is upheld the appellant will be entitled to a one-eighth share of the residue.\nCertain admitted facts, in addition to those mentioned above, were stated in the Courts below and before us and I will set these out without pausing to discuss their relevance.\nFrank C Ottewell and his twin brother Fred S. Ottewell lived and farmed in the Clover Bar district of the province of Alberta. They lived together for some years before the death of Fred. The testator Frank C Ottewell was a bachelor and his brother Fred S. Ottewell was divorced. Fred S. Ottewell made his will on May 5, 1957, and Frank C Ottewell made his will on June 19, 1957. The will of Frank C Ottewell was in the same words mutatis mutandis as the will of Fred S. Ottewell; each left the other his entire estate save for the bequest to the Clover Bar United Church in the will of Frank C. Ottewell. The wills were both drawn by the same solicitors in the city of Edmonton and the signature of the solicitor Bruce D. Patterson appears as witness on both wills. At the time they made their wills the twin brothers were 52 years of age and the appellant was 30 years of age. In addition to the appellant Frank C. Ottewell had the following next-of-kin entitled to take on an intestacy in 1957:\n\u2014a brother 75 years of age\n\u2014a sister 74 years of age\n\u2014a brother 71 years of age\n\u2014a sister 78 years of age\n\u2014a brother 70 years of age\n\u2014three daughters of a brother who had died in 1950, aged 21, 18 and 14 years\n\u2014a sister who died in 1961 leaving a son who was 41 years of age in 1957.\nFred S. Ottewell, died on June 15, 1965; his estate consisted of personalty having a net value of $125,862.98, which went to his brother Frank C. Ottewell.\nThe contention of the appellant is that the words with which the residuary clause concludes\u2014\u201cto hold unto him, his heirs, executors and administrators absolutely and forever\u201d are words of substitution not of limitation. I can find no support for this submission in the numerous cases which were referred to in argument or in the text-writers. No assistance is derived from decisions such as In re Marshall Estate[2] dealing with wills in which the wording in a devise or bequest is \u201cto X or his heirs\u201d. The words of the will with which we are concerned have long been held to be words of limitation not of substitution. It is quite true that their insertion is no longer necessary to confer an absolute interest in realty and that, as Vaisey J. pointed out in In re McElligott; Grant v. McElligott[3], they are inapt in a bequest of personalty; but this circumstance does not alter their character or effect. I am in agreement with the passage from the reasons of Vaisey J. in the last-mentioned case which was adopted by Johnson J.A.:\n\u2026there can, I think, be no room for doubting that a limitation of personal estate to one and his heirs operates to vest in the person named an absolute interest, the words being for that purpose adequate, although inapt.\nand I agree with Johnson J.A. that the rule is equally applicable where the property given consists of mixed realty and personalty.\nIn my opinion the duty of a court of construction is accurately stated in Theobald on Wills, 12th ed., s. 417, p. 127, as follows:\nWhat has to be done is first to construe the will. The meaning placed upon the language used as the result of this process cannot be altered by reference to the surrounding circumstances when the will was executed. The procedure is not\u2014first ascertain the surrounding circumstances and with that knowledge approach the construction of the will, but first construe the will; if the meaning is clear, surrounding circumstances cannot be looked at to throw a doubt upon that meaning, or to give the will a different meaning.\nIn my view, the meaning of the will is clear; it contains no patent ambiguity; if the facts surrounding its execution recited above are considered they do not disclose any latent ambiguity and they are consequently irrelevant. The will has been correctly construed by Milvain C.J. and by the majority in the Appellate Division.\nI am in general agreement with the reasons given by Milvain C.J. and by Johnson J.A. for holding that the words quoted from the residuary clause are words of limitation.\nI would dismiss the appeal. All counsel who appeared before us, in answer to a question from the Court, submitted that, whatever the result of the appeal, in view of there being a difference of opinion in the Appellate Division, the costs of all parties represented before us should be paid out of the estate and, not without some hesitation, I would so order.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Macdonald, Spitz & Lavall\u00e9e, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the respondents, Ella Hamilton, George Ottewell, John Devereux and Jennie Smith: Field, Hyndman, Field, Owen, Blakey & Bodner, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the respondents, William J.

Limited (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1969: November 13, 14; 1969: November 14.\nPresent: Cartwright C.J. and Abbott, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nTrade marks\u2014Brewery using word \u201cPil\u201d to describe Pilsener beer\u2014Competitor using \u201cPilcan\u201d\u2014Whether directing attention to wares in a manner likely to cause confusion\u2014Comparison of labels and cartons\u2014Trade Marks Act, 1952-53 (Can.), c. 49, s. 7(b).\nIn 1963, the plaintiff adopted and used the unregistered word \u201cPil\u201d on the bottle caps of the Pilsener beer it sold in British Columbia, and in the advertising of it in newspapers. Then in 1964, it used that word on the cartons in which it sold its Pilsener beer. In 1966, the defendant introduced canned beer to British Columbia and used the word \u201cPilcan\u201d on its beer cans and cartons. During the relevant period no other competitor marketed beer in cans in that province. There was evidence that the defendant was also marketing beer under names similar to famous United States brands. The plaintiff brought action under s. 7(b) of the Trade Marks Act, 1952-53 (Can.), c. 49. The trial judge held that the defendant, in relation to its activities concerning \u201cPilcan\u201d and the \u201cget up\u201d of the packaging of its canned Pilsener beer, directed public attention to its wares in such a way as to cause or be likely to cause confusion in British Columbia within the meaning of s. 7(b) of the Act. The defendant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nOn a comparison of the labels and cartons used by the defendant and the plaintiff respectively, it cannot be said that a purchaser of Pilsener beer would be deceived or confused or misled into believing that the defendant\u2019s beer was the plaintiff\u2019s beer. There is just no appreciable similarity in the labels or cartons that would cause or be likely to cause confusion. The plaintiff does not sell its Pilsener beer in cans. The defendant does not sell its Pilsener beer in bottles. The cartons are as unalike as two beer cartons can be, both in shape and colouring.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], maintaining an action under s. 7(b) of the Trade Marks Act. Appeal allowed.\nW.J. Wallace, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nChristopher Robinson, Q.C., and James Kokonis, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nHALL J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of Gibson J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada1 in which he held that the appellant, in relation to its activities concerning \u201cPilcan\u201d and the \u201cget up\u201d of the packaging of its canned Pilsener beer, did direct public attention to its wares in such a way as to cause or be likely to cause confusion in British Columbia within the meaning of s. 7(b) of the Trade Marks Act, 1-2 Eliz. II, c. 49, between the appellant\u2019s (Tartan) Pilcan Pilsener beer and respondent\u2019s (Carling) Pil Pilsener beer.\nPilsener beer is a beer which was first brewed in the Town of Pilzen, Bohemia (now Czechoslovakia) some 125 years ago. Accordingly, neither the appellant nor the respondent had any proprietary interest in or any exclusive right to the word \u201cPilsener\u201d.\nThe appellant and the respondent are brewers of beer in the Province of British Columbia, including Pilsener beer. The respondent\u2019s brewery was in the Vancouver area and that of the appellant at Prince George in North Central British Columbia. They had been selling Pilsener beer in competition from the year 1962.\nIn the year 1963 the respondent devised and embarked upon a market program for the selling of its Pilsener beer and to assist in this undertaking, employed advertising agents, and expended substantial sums and effort. In implementing its program, it adopted and used the unregistered word \u201cPil\u201d on the bottle caps of the Pilsener beer it sold in British Columbia, and in the advertising of it in newspapers. Then in 1964 it used the word \u201cPil\u201d on the cartons in which it sold its Pilsener beer. And from that time on, all its Pilsener beer was sold in that way in British Columbia.\nThe appellant had, in the same period, been marketing its Pilsener beer in bottles under the trade name of \u201cTartan Pilsner\u201d. All beer being sold in British Columbia prior to mid-1966 was being sold in bottles. In July 1966 the appellant introduced canned beer to the Province of British Columbia. During the period relevant to this litigation, no other competitor marketed beer in cans in that province.\nThe evidence of B.G. Ginter, the major shareholder in the appellant company as to how the word \u201cPilcan\u201d came to be used by the appellant, was as follows:\nQ. Now then, would you tell his lordship how it came about that you used the word \u201cPilcan\u201d as a designation on Exhibit \u201cA\u201d?\nA. Well, we discussed the name that we would use to come out with a canned beer onto the market, as this was something new in Western Canada, when we marketed it. Now, of course it is in Manitoba as well. But at that time it hadn\u2019t been known of anybody manufacturing, so again I went back to the fact of trying to bring out the fact that it was a light beer as the brewmaster Mr. Zarek has often told me, that when introducing a beer no brewery has, that he has ever known of, come out with anything else but a light beer on the market first, and to identify the lightness of the beer plus the fact that it was in a can, we arrived at the name \u201cPilcan\u201d.\nThe respondent does not suggest that in its primary meaning the word \u201cPil\u201d had any connection with the respondent\u2019s product. The evidence discloses that \u201cPil\u201d was more or less a nickname for Pilsener beer both in and outside British Columbia for many years preceding 1963. The evidence did not disclose that the word \u201cPil\u201d had acquired a secondary meaning nor did the learned trial judge so hold.\nGibson J. did find that:\nThe conclusion is, therefore, that it was the intention of the defendant to and it did, in mid-1966, in relation to its activities concerning \u201cPil\u2019Can\u201d and the \u201cget-up\u201d of the packaging of its canned Pilsener beer direct public attention to its wares in issue in this action, in such a way as to cause or likely to cause confusion in British Columbia within the meaning of section 7(b) of the Trade Marks Act between the defendant\u2019s (Tartan) \u201cPilcan\u201d Pilsener beer and the plaintiff\u2019s (Carling) \u201cPil\u201d Pilsener beer.\nIn coming to this conclusion, the learned judge was greatly influenced by evidence which had been received to the effect that in addition to marketing Pilsener beer under the label \u201cPilcan\u201d the appellant was also marketing beer which it called \u201cHigh Life\u201d, \u201cPaabs\u201d and \u201cBudd\u201d, and in respect of this the learned judge said: Clearly the adoption of the last three names in the way such was done, was calculated to direct public attention in such a way as to cause or be likely to cause confusion between these brands of beer of the defendant\u2019s and the respective famous brand of beers of the United States brewers\u2019, which latter brands would be known to the buying public in British Columbia.\nI doubt if this evidence was admissible at all, but in any event there was no evidence that appellant did not have a licence to use these names and the conclusion adverse to appellant which Gibson J. drew from this evidence dominated his finding as to the intention of appellant in respect of the use of \u201cPilcan\u201d.\nIn my view this case falls to be determined from a comparison of the labels and cartons used by the appellant and respondent respectively and which are said to be so similar as to cause or be likely to cause confusion.\nThe labels and cartons are as in the inset.\nI do not see how it can be said that a purchaser of Pilsener beer would be deceived or confused or misled into believing that the appellant\u2019s \u201cPilcan\u201d beer was the respondent\u2019s \u201cPil\u201d beer. There is just no appreciable similarity in the labels or cartons that would cause or be likely to cause confusion. The respondent does not sell its Pilsener beer in cans. The appellant does not sell its Pilsener beer in bottles. The cartons are as unalike as two beer cartons can be, both in shape and colouring.\nThe appeal must, accordingly, be allowed and the respondent\u2019s action dismissed with costs here and in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Bull, Housser & Tupper, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: R.H.

The respondent also brought action against the appellant JZ in respect of his promissory note for $5,000, dated January 14, 1960, and also against the appellant Z as guarantor of the indebtedness of the former to the bank. The actions were consolidated and judgment at trial was given in favour of the bank. A counterclaim by the appellants was dismissed. An appeal to the Court of Appeal having failed, the appellants appealed further to this Court.\nB, a manager of the respondent bank, had advised Y and Z to loan money to C, a customer of the bank, and offered to cause the bank to loan money to them so that they could, in turn, loan it to C. The appellant JZ knew nothing of this transaction and acted simply to accommodate his brother Z.\nOn the question as to whether B represented to Y and Z on September 8, 1958, that he then held in the possession of the bank an assignment of an insurance policy on C\u2019s life which so soon as they made a loan to C would be a security for the repayment of that loan, the trial judge accepted B\u2019s evidence that \u201che agreed that the life insurance policy was to be assigned, subject to the bank\u2019s interest\u201d to Y and Z. The members of the Court of Appeal were of the view that neither Y nor Z, nor B, nor any combination of these, established that B represented to the appellants that the life insurance was being held for their benefit at the conclusion of the meeting on September 8, 1958.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: Agreement was expressed with the reasons given in the Court of Appeal for dismissing the appellants\u2019 appeal from the judgment at trial.\nPer Spence J.: The argument of counsel for the appellants failed to upset the concurrent finding by the Courts below with respect to B\u2019s representation to the appellants concerning the insurance policy. On the other hand, there were certain circumstances furnishing strong corroboration of that finding.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Macdonald J. Appeal dismissed.\nAllan D. McEachern, for the defendants, appellants.\nP.B.C. Pepper, Q.C., and R.I.A. Smith, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.\u2014I am in agreement with the reasons given in the Court of Appeal, by the Chief Justice and by Robertson J.A., for dismissing the appellants\u2019 appeal from the judgment at trial. Accordingly, I would dismiss their appeal to this Court, with costs.\nSPENCE J.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of my brother, Mr. Justice Martland, and I concur in the view that the appeal should be dismissed.\nIt would seem that the crucial question is whether the respondent Burnie did represent to the appellants, or more properly the two of them, Sidney Young and Jacob Zalkowitz, on September 8, 1958, that he, Burnie, then held in the possession of the bank, in his filing cabinet in his office, an assignment of the insurance policy on Dr. Caldwell\u2019s life which so soon as they made a loan to Dr. Caldwell would be a security for the repayment of that loan. Had such a representation by Burnie been proved, I would have found great difficulty in determining that the bank was not bound by the action of its servant who was, in my view, then acting within the scope of his employment. It must be remembered that the bank had already, through the agency of Burnie, loaned Dr. Caldwell $15,000, although Burnie admitted that he was only authorized to advance $10,000, and that not only did Burnie advise Young and Jacob Zalkowitz to loan money to Dr. Caldwell but he offered to cause the bank of which he was the manager to loan money to them so that they could, in turn, loan it to Dr. Caldwell. Surely it was the business of the bank manager to increase the bank\u2019s business by making loans. Of course, so far as Jonas Zalkowitz is concerned the learned trial judge has found that he knew nothing about the transaction between Burnie and Young and his brother Jacob, and acted simply to accommodate that brother. Therefore, he could not rely on any representation of Burnie.\nHowever, the learned trial judge has accepted Burnie\u2019s evidence that \u201che agreed that the life insurance policy was to be assigned, subject to the bank\u2019s interest, to Zalkowitz (referring to Jacob Zalkowitz) and Young.\u201d (The italics are my own). Robertson J.A. in his reasons, concurred in by all members of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, after a very careful analysis of the evidence, said:\nMy conclusion on the evidence is that neither Young nor Jacob Zalkowitz, nor Burnie, nor any combination of these, established that Burnie represented to the appellants that the life insurance was being held for their benefit at the conclusion of the meeting on 8th September, 1958. I am of the opinion that the very able argument of counsel for the appellants failed to upset that concurrent finding. On the other hand, as did Robertson J.A., I regard three circumstances as furnishing strong corroboration of that finding. Firstly, the action of Burnie on September 18, in obtaining two cheques, left blank as to payee, in the amount of $25,000 each on Caldwell\u2019s bank account in the branch of the bank of which Burnie was manager, and also, Dr. Caldwell\u2019s note, likewise blank as to payee, in the same amount and his evidence that these devices were to enable the debts to Young and Zalkowitz and the Hudsons to have the benefit of the security represented by the insurance policy, are the clearest evidence that ten days after he made the representation, Burnie was attempting to create a situation which would make good his representation, i.e., that the policy was to be assigned to the appellants. Secondly, in 1962, Burnie attempted to have absolute assignments of the policy in favour of the appellants executed by Mrs. Caldwell, the specific beneficiary, and Doctors Kepkay and Gillis, \u201cthe owners of the said policy,\u201d but was frustrated by the refusal of these persons to execute the assignments. Again, Burnie indicated that he was attempting to make good his representation that the policy was to be assigned. Thirdly, the appellants\u2019 pleading in para. 8(j) of the amended statement of defence was of the same exact representation of what was to be done in the future.\nFor these reasons I concur that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Russell & Du Moulin, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Bank of Montreal: Campney, Owen & Murphy, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Archibald Robert Burnie: Freeman, Freeman, Silvers & Koffman, Vancouver.\n",

The scheme which was well publicized in the newspapers, consists in inviting the general public to become voluntary taxpayers of the City by making monthly contributions of a fixed amount of $2, or multiples thereof, and in inducing the public to participate by saying that every month there will be drawn, from the names of all those who will have contributed during that month, the names of 151 persons who will then be called, at a later date, to be questioned, in an order determined by lot, on their knowledge of the City of Montreal and win, if they answer correctly, prizes ranging from $100 to $100,000 depending on the order in which they are questioned, the 151st person being the only one in a position to win $100,000. The advertisements published in the newspapers stated that the prizes will be given after the candidates have answered correctly and in public some of the questions which correspond to the answers printed on the reverse side of the official receipt. By resolution of the Executive Committee prizes were to be in the form of silver ingots. The City appealed to this Court. Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe majority judgment in the Court of Appeal rightly decided that the advertisements published in the newspapers clearly showed that the intention of the City, as regards the examination, was to make it as easy and as painless as possible, and that in fact, what the City had told the public, by necessary implication if not expressly, was that the statements printed on the reverse of the official receipt were the answers to the questions that will be asked; that the ability to memorize these simple statements and to repeat them in public could at best be considered as a minimal degree of skill incapable of keeping the scheme within the law, as attempted by the introduction of this type of examination as the final step of an operation based essentially on chance; and that the form of the prizes was another device to shield the scheme against the application of the law.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], on a reference concerning the carrying out of a scheme by the City of Montreal to obtain additional revenue. Appeal dismissed.\nMichel C\u00f4t\u00e9, Antonio Lamer and Jacques Fortin, for the appellant.\nFred Kaufman, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.\u2014This appeal, submitted to this Court on November 26, 1969, was inscribed under the provisions of s. 37 of the Supreme Court Act and those of the Act Respecting a Reference to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Statutes of Quebec, 17 Eliz. II, c. 83, assented to on May 9, 1968.\nThe City of Montreal appeals from a majority opinion of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (Appeal side) on a Reference ordered by Order-in-council No. 1354, adopted on May 8, 1968, by the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of Quebec, to have the Court determine if the carrying out of a scheme adopted by the City of Montreal to obtain additional revenue would contravene any provision of the Criminal Code. Described in the Order-in-council and the Appendices thereto, the scheme, which was well publicized in the newspapers, consists, in brief, in inviting the general public, through the appropriate media, to become voluntary taxpayers of the City by making monthly contributions of a fixed amount of $2 (or multiples thereof) and in inducing the public to participate by saying that every month there will be drawn, from the names of all those who will have contributed during that month, the names of 151 persons who will then be called, at a later date, to be questioned, in an order determined by lot, on their knowledge of the City of Montreal and win, if they answer correctly, prizes ranging from $100 to $100,000 depending on the order in which they are questioned, the 151st person being the only one in a position to win $100,000. The description of the examination is found, in different terms, in the text of the resolution passed by the City council when the principle of the scheme was approved, in the text of the resolution passed by the Executive Committee to determine the mechanics thereof, and in the advertisements published by the City of Montreal in various newspapers. This description, which is vague in the text of the resolutions, becomes more precise in the advertisements meant for the general public, in which we find the following:\n[TRANSLATION] \u2026prizes will be given after they (the candidates) have answered correctly and in public some of the questions which correspond to the answers printed on the reverse side of the official receipt.\nWe find, printed on the reverse of that receipt which is given to the taxpayer upon payment of the so-called voluntary tax, twenty answers of which the following four are typical:\n1. Montr\u00e9al was founded in 1642.\n3. Montr\u00e9al is the Metropolis of Canada.\n5. The great river linking Montr\u00e9al to the Atlantic Ocean is the St. Lawrence River.\n9. The mountain located within the limits of the City of Montr\u00e9al is Mount Royal.\nIn the advertisement, published in the newspaper La Presse, we find the following:\n[TRANSLATION] If a child is too young to answer the questions, his father, mother or other person having paid on his behalf may answer in his stead. Although the resolution of the Executive Committee provides that:\n[TRANSLATION] All the prizes will be physically in the form of silver ingots, worth at least the amount advertised,\nthe description of the prizes is as follows in the same advertisement:\n[TRANSLATION]\n1ST PRIZE....................................\n$100,000 IN SILVER\nAND:\n30 Prizes of...................................\n$1,000 each, in Silver\n20 Prizes of...................................\n$ 500 each, in Silver\n100 Prizes of.................................\n$ 100 each, in Silver\nAfter having heard counsel for the Attorney General of the Province and for the City of Montreal, the Court of Appeal (Tremblay C.J., Casey, Rinfret, Taschereau and Owen JJ.) reserved judgment and on a later date, answered the question as follows: of the five members of the Court, three (Casey, Taschereau and Owen JJ.) answered affirmatively on the ground that the execution of the scheme would contravene, in the opinion of the first two, the provisions of s. 179(1)(d) and (1)(e) of the Criminal Code, and in the opinion of the third, the provisions of s. 179(1)(d). The Chief Justice and Rinfret J., dissenting, answered in the negative. However, the Chief Justice indicated that, [TRANSLATION] \u201cif they (the persons called for the examination) were being asked only the questions for which the answers are provided on the reverse of the receipt given by the City\u201d he would have answered in the affirmative.\nIn his reasons, which are concurred in by Taschereau J., Casey J. states, in brief, that the advertisements published in the newspapers clearly show that the intention of the City, as regards the examination which a certain number of taxpayers of this so-called voluntary tax must undergo, is to make it as easy and as painless as possible, and that in fact, what the City has told the public, by necessary implication if not expressly, is that the statements printed on the reverse of the official receipt are the answers to the questions that will be asked. In the learned Judge\u2019s opinion the ability to memorize these simple statements and to repeat them in public can at best be considered as a minimal degree of skill incapable, in the light of jurisprudential criteria, of keeping the scheme within the law, as attempted by the introduction of this type of examination as the final step of an operation based essentially on chance.\nCasey J. adds that he is satisfied that the prizes offered to the public in the newspaper advertisements are cash prizes and that the above-mentioned provision of the Executive Committee\u2019s resolution, dealing with the form of the prizes, is another device to shield the scheme against the application of the law.\nWith all due respect for the contrary opinion, I must say that we are all in agreement with the reasons and findings stated in the opinion of Casey J., which reasons and findings we adopt in their entirety and to which we feel nothing can usefully be added.\nWith these views, it is unnecessary to pursue any further consideration of the question submitted in the Reference. It follows that the appeal must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: M. Cot\u00e9 & A. Lamer, Montreal.\nSolicitors for the respondent: C. Gagnon, Quebec & F.

There was no evidence of any immediate demand for such a site. The two witnesses for the appellant estimated the market value at $67,500 and $54,000 respectively and the respondent\u2019s witness, at $27,000. The trial judge did not adopt any of these estimates. He fixed the value at $30,000 as being the price that a speculator would have paid to acquire it and for which an owner would have sold it. The owner appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nAs a judge of fact, the trial judge was entitled to refuse to accept the estimates of the witnesses and their opinions as to the impact of the Green Belt plan on land values. The final estimate made by him was fully adequate in the light of the evidence.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Jackett P. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], in an expropriation matter. Appeal dismissed.\nKeith E. Eaton and Thomas A. McDougall, for the defendant, appellant. Eileen Mitchell Thomas, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court[2] fixing, at the sum of $30,000, the compensation to be paid by the respondent (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Commission\u201d) to the appellant for property expropriated by it on June 14, 1961. The appellant\u2019s contention is that the compensation should have been fixed at the sum of $54,000.\nBy agreement of the parties, the only question to be determined at the trial was the market value of the land at the time of the expropriation.\nThe land expropriated is located in the Township of Nepean, west of the Village of Bell\u2019s Corners, on the south side of Highway No. 15, leading from Ottawa to Carleton Place. It has an area of 13.5 acres, with a frontage of 350 feet on that highway. Its rear boundary extends for 600 feet along the Canadian Pacific Railway Company line. At the time of expropriation the land was vacant, unserviced, unimproved and generally flat, and at grade with the highway, and with a road allowance on its westerly side. It was not subject to any zoning by\u2011law, but was subject to a subdivision control by-law passed by the Township of Nepean.\nThe land had been acquired by the appellant on November 9, 1956, for a consideration of $8,000, an average cost of approximately $593 per acre.\nThe expropriation was made by the Commission for the purposes of the National Capital Green Belt, the nature of which, it was agreed by the parties, was considered in National Capital Commission v. Munro[3]. The acreage of Green Belt land in Nepean Township is approximately 17,000 acres, of which the Commission acquired some 14,000 acres by purchase, and approximately 3,000 acres by expropriation, 1,400 acres in 1959 and 1,600 acres in 1961. Three witnesses gave evidence as to their opinions in respect of the market value of the land in question in this case, two of them, Whelan and Young, on behalf of the appellant, and the other one, Crawford, on behalf of the Commission. Their estimates were as follows:\nWhelan:\n$67,500\n($5,000 an acre)\nYoung:\n54,000\n( 4,000 \u201c \u201c )\nCrawford:\n27,000\n( 2,000 \u201c \u201c )\nThe learned President of the Exchequer Court did not adopt any of these estimates, as appears from the following extract from his reasons:\nIn the case of each of these witnesses, after saying that he has considered certain matters (which are, generally speaking, proper matters to consider), the witness says that he has reached a certain conclusion as to market value of the subject property at the time of the expropriation. But when, for the purpose of assessing what weight, if any, to give to one of these opinions, one attempts to ascertain how the witness has allowed various factors mentioned by him to enter into the production of his ultimate conclusion, or why he had discarded certain of them as being of no importance in reaching a valid conclusion, one is faced with a lack of any such information in respect of many factors and, in respect of others, reasons for disregarding them that seem to lack validity. It follows that I must reach my own conclusion making the best use I can of the information and ideas that the witnesses and counsel have made available to me.\nWhat I must do, as I understand it, is put myself in the position of a person owning the subject property just before the expropriation willing to sell, but under no compulsion to sell, and capable of appreciating all the factors bearing on what a reasonably prudent and competent person would take into account in the circumstances, and consider what amount he would insist on having before he would sell; and I must put myself in the position of a person desiring to buy a property such as the subject property just before the expropriation but under no necessity of obtaining that particular property, and capable of appreciating all the factors bearing on what a reasonably prudent and competent person would take into account in the circumstances, and consider what is the highest amount that he would be prepared to pay to acquire the property.\nIn making their estimates as to market value, the two witnesses called by the appellant, Whelan and Young, when making comparisons with other land sales in the area, clearly relied chiefly upon a sale made by Lobel to Hodgins Lumber Company in April, 1961. The land involved in that sale was within the boundaries of the Village of Bell\u2019s Corners, and, in consequence, not within the Green Belt area. The learned President compares that property with the land involved in the present case, in the following passage from his judgment:\nThere would appear to be no doubt, on any appreciation that I can make of the matter on the material before me, that the sale that is of greatest assistance is the sale from Lobel to Hodgins Lumber just before the expropriation. The general characteristics of the two properties are comparable. Both properties have frontage on Highway 15 and on the Canadian Pacific Railway line. The expropriated property is only a few minutes further from Ottawa than the Hodgins Lumber property. While the expropriated property was 13\u00bd acres, the Hodgins Lumber property was only 10 acres. The Hodgins Lumber parcel had more Highway 15 frontage than the subject property, about the same railway frontage as the subject property, no side road allowance frontage, and was subject to an easement that was a serious disability. The subject property had over 1,100 feet of side road allowance frontage, had 3\u00bd acres more area, and was not subject to any Hydro or other easement.\nThe purchase price paid for the land involved in the sale to Hodgins was $50,000, or $5,000 an acre. Mr. Whelan\u2019s estimate of the market value of the appellant\u2019s land was at $5,000 an acre. Mr. Young\u2019s oral evidence showed that he placed \u201cgreatest reliance\u201d in reaching his valuation on the sale to Hodgins.\nThe evidence of Crawford as to the evidentiary value of the sale to Hodgins is dealt with by the learned President as follows:\nHe also gave evidence regarding the Hodgins Lumber Company purchase, on which the other two witnesses relied so strongly. He said that the Hydro Company, some years after Hodgins bought the land in question subject to the Hydro easement for $50,000, paid Hodgins $17,064 for the land over which the easement ran so that the net cost of the land to Hodgins was only about $33,000. There was, however, no evidence that Hodgins had any reason to anticipate any such windfall when it bought the property in 1961, and I am of opinion therefore that this approach must be rejected because, in considering the effect of a transaction as evidence of the market existing at the time it was entered into, it is the terms and circumstances of that transaction that must be considered and not the net cost of the land to the purchaser as a result of that transaction coupled with some subsequent transaction not foreseeable at the time.\nThe learned President gave very careful consideration to all the evidence which was before him, and had a view of the land in question. He reached certain conclusions following such consideration. One of these was that the entry of Government into the market for Green Belt lands did not reduce the value of such lands.\nDealing with the lack of evidence before him of a demand for properties of the type in question here, the learned President said this:\nNo witness put before the Court a factual picture of the supply of, and demand for, sites of the general character of the subject property in the Ottawa area immediately before the expropriation. There was some evidence to suggest that industrial sites that were available in 1961 on railway sidings in the City of Ottawa were very expensive, and there was evidence by one witness that, while he did not know of such sites on Highway 15 in Nepean Township, he did know of sites with highway and railway frontage of approximately the size of the subject property that were available elsewhere in Nepean Township. That was evidence that came out incidentally in the course of cross\u2011examination.\nThere is some slight evidence, as I have indicated, that there were other sites like the subject property in Nepean Township. I should have thought that others in the general Ottawa area would have competed with those in Nepean Township on or off of Highway 15, some being more sought after for one type of demand and others being more sought after for other types of demand. I have no evidence, however, as to whether there was any scarcity of such sites to meet any demand for them. I am struck, moreover, with the fact that there was no evidence at all of any immediate demand for sites such as the subject property either for industrial or commercial purposes, for government undertakings, or for any other purpose. In the absence of any evidence that there was, just before the expropriation, any such demand in the market, I must conclude, as I have already indicated, that the probable willing purchaser for a site such as the subject property at that time was a dealer or speculator buying to hold for re\u2011sale when such a demand did arise.\nIn the light of this lack of evidence, and taking into consideration the sale to Hodgins, he stated the following conclusion:\nI am of the view that, in 1961, if it were not for the Green Belt, a person wanting a property for the sort of development that Hodgins Lumber had in mind would have paid $50,000 for the subject property just as willingly as Hodgins Lumber paid that amount for the property that it acquired at that time. That being so, on the basis that I have already laid down, that the subject property was equally valuable for government institutions or other Green Belt purposes, as it would have been for commercial or industrial purposes if it were not for the Green Belt, I am of the opinion that if such a property had been required at that time for such a purpose, the parties would have reached agreement on a price of about $50,000. As, however, there is no evidence of any such realized requirement at that time and it is a matter of valuing it on its potentiality for such a purpose, I am of opinion that, looking only at the Hodgins Lumber purchase, the proper price to put on it is $30,000, being the highest price that, I should have thought, a dealer or speculator would have paid to acquire it for resale to such a purchaser, if and when one appeared, and the price for which an owner of the property willing to sell it at that time, but under no pressure, would have sold it.\nWhen I take into account the various considerations that I have enumerated in connection with other transactions, they do not cause me to change the conclusion that I have reached, based on the Hodgins Lumber transaction.\nThere is no principle of law in issue on this appeal. Counsel for the appellant contended that the launching of the Green Belt plan had reduced values of lands within it, and that, in determining values for expropriation, such diminution must be disregarded. However, the learned President found as a fact that such diminution in value had not occurred. Furthermore, he estimated the value of the land in question on the basis that it would be equivalent to the value of similar land not within the Green Belt, i.e., the subject-matter of the sale to Hodgins. In refusing to award an amount equal to the price in the Hodgins sale, he did so, not because the appellant\u2019s land was within and the Hodgin\u2019s land was not within the Green Belt, but because of lack of evidence of any immediate demand for such a site.\nIt is true that he refused to accept the estimates of the three witnesses and their opinions as to the impact of the Green Belt plan on land values, but he was entitled, as a judge of fact, to do this, and it is clear to me that he fully apprehended the evidence before him, and considered it in forming his opinion. He reached his own conclusion as to the question of fact which he was called upon to determine; i.e., the market value of the land at the time of expropriation. Without necessarily approving the test as to what a speculator would pay for the land as being the measure of its market value, I do not disagree with the final estimate which he made, which, in my view, was fully adequate in the light of the evidence.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: D.S.

Wilkes, Assessment Commissioner for the Corporation of the City of St. Catharines (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nInterlake Tissue Mills Co. Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1969: June 17, 18; 1969: December 17.\nPresent: Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nTaxation\u2014Substantial reduction achieved on 1960 assessment appeal\u2014Appeal for refund of taxes paid in 1960 on 1959 assessment on ground of gross or manifest error\u2014The Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 23, ss. 72 and 131.\nThe respondent company appealed its 1960 assessment, with the ultimate result that it achieved a very substantial reduction. It later took proceedings under s. 131(1)(f) of The Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 23, for a refund of taxes paid in the year 1960 on the 1959 assessment on the ground that there had been a gross or manifest error. These refund proceedings went through the Court of Revision, County Court, the Municipal Board, and the Court of Appeal, and then came before this Court. The County Court judge allowed the appeal because of an over-assessment in 1959 and directed the refund to the respondent of that part of the 1960 taxes attributable to the over-assessment. The Municipal Board allowed the appeal and held that the over-assessment in question did not come within the terms of s. 131(1) (f) as being gross or manifest error. The Court of Appeal restored the judgment of the County Court judge.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.: Sections 72 and 131 of The Assessment Act deal with entirely different things, the former section being concerned with an appeal from an assessment while the latter deals with an application for abatement or refund of taxes. Therefore, the efficacy of any attempt to bring into the interpretation of the words of s. 131(1) any meaning for words established in reference to their use in s. 72 was doubted. Section 131 is a remedial section which empowers a Court of Revision to do essential justice to a taxpayer who has been overcharged by reason of any \u201cgross or manifest error\u201d. In the present case, the overcharge, as judged by the result of the assessment appeal, was in the order of fifty per cent which, within the meaning of the section, was \u201cgross\u201d.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: There is no connection between ss. 72 and 131 and they deal with different problems. Section 72 is the regular appeal procedure. Section 131 deals with the state of the roll and has nothing to do with the quantum of assessment validly made. When s. 131 is invoked the taxes are being levied on \u201cthe last revised assessment roll\u201d of the previous year, (57(1) and 57(4)). At this stage, the assessor\u2019s error in judgment, if any, of over-assessment cannot be attacked. The section is applicable to the correction of a mistake of fact in the making of the assessment or placing it on the roll.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal from a decision of the Ontario Municipal Board. Appeal dismissed, Judson J. dissenting.\nJ.T. Weir, Q.C., and Merton Seymour, Q.C., for the appellant.\nR.N. Robertson and S. Lederman, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 pronounced on June 10, 1968. By that judgment, the Court allowed an appeal from the decision of the Ontario Municipal Board made on April 10, 1967. The Ontario Municipal Board allowed an appeal from the judgment of Kinnear Co.Ct.J. pronounced on June 20, 1961, in which judgment Her Honour allowed the application of the respondent under the provisions of s. 131(1) of The Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 23, for a refund of taxes paid by the applicant in the year 1960, upon an assessment made in the year 1959. The Town of Merritton, as it then was, now part of the Corporation of the City of St. Catharines, had assessed the Interlake Tissue Mills Co. Limited and other industries in the area in the same fashion from 1948 to 1960, had levied taxes upon such assessments and had collected the taxes. During that period, there had been no appeal against the assessment such as that to which I shall refer hereafter.\nIn the year 1960, Interlake Tissue Mills Co. Limited, hereinafter referred to as \u201cInterlake\u201d, in view of the terms of amalgamation between Merritton and St. Catharines, appealed the assessment made in that year upon which the 1961 taxes would be based. On February 10, 1961, Interlake filed an application to the Court of Revision of the County of Lincoln for a refund of taxes paid in the year 1960 upon the basis that there had been \u201ca gross or manifest error\u201d within the meaning of The Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 23, s. 131(1) (f). The Court of Revision considered the appeal as to the 1960 assessment and made certain small reductions in the assessment. Interlake further appealed this assessment to the County Court judge in accordance with the provisions of the statute. Her Honour Judge Kinnear, by her judgment delivered on May 23, 1961, very materially reduced the assessments holding that the assessor had proceeded on wrong principles and had failed to act in accordance with the provisions of s. 35 of The Assessment Act, subs. (1) of which simply provides \u201csubject to this section, land shall be assessed at its actual value\u201d.\nSection 131(5) of The Assessment Act provides:\n131. (5) The court of revision shall hear and dispose of every application not later than the 31st day of March in the year following the year in respect of which the application is made and the clerk shall thereupon cause notice of the decision in such application to be given by mail to the persons to whom notice of the hearing of such application was given and such notice shall state thereon that such decision may be appealed to the county judge within ten days of the mailing of such notice. Subsection (6) further provides:\n(6) An appeal may be had to the county judge by the applicant or the municipality from the decision of the court of revision or where the court of revision has omitted, neglected or refused to hear or dispose of an application under this section, and such appeal shall be a hearing de novo.\nThe Court of Revision having failed to deal in any way with the application for refund of taxes, therefore Interlake proceeded before the County Court judge in accordance with the provisions of the aforesaid subs. (6).\nThe learned County Court judge in detailed and very carefully considered reasons delivered on June 20, 1961, allowed the application (it was described as allowing an appeal but since the application has never been considered it might be more proper to say allowed the application) for the refund of taxes and directed that they should be refunded in the same proportion as she had previously reduced the assessment for the year 1960. It was this judgment, which was reversed by the Ontario Municipal Board and was restored by the Court of Appeal, which is the subject of the appeal to this Court. Section 131(1)(f) of The Assessment Act provides:\n131. (1) An application to the court of revision for the cancellation, reduction or refund of taxes levied in the year in respect of which the application is made may be made by any person,\n* * *\n(f) who is overcharged by reason of any gross or manifest error;\n* * *\nIt has been the contention of Interlake throughout that that subsection applies exactly to its situation and that under the subsection it is entitled to an order for the refund of the taxes which were paid on the basis of the 1959 taxes to the extent that they have been found in error by the decision of the learned County Court judge in granting the assessment appeal to which I have referred. The assessor, however, has contended throughout and as appellant in this Court contends that s. 131(1) (f) does not refer to a situation such as this at all but refers only to what may be called a mechanical error in either the assessment roll or the tax bill.\nThe appellant submits that the taxpayer\u2019s right to make objection to an assessment is by an appeal under the provisions of s. 72 of The Assessment Act and that if the taxpayer does not proceed in accordance with that section then the roll becomes finalized as the assessment roll of the municipality and there may be no further objection thereto. Counsel for the appellant stresses the necessity that a municipality must know that a roll is finalized in order to be able to know its revenue for a current year and, in the light of this information, fix its expenditures. Section 72 of The Assessment Act commences with the words:\nAny person complaining of an error or omission in regard to himself, as having been wrongly inserted in or omitted from the roll or as having been undercharged or overcharged by the assessor in the roll\nand seeks to bring into the consideration of an application under s. 131 the words \u201cerror\u201d, \u201comission\u201d, \u201cundercharged\u201d, \u201covercharged\u201d, and \u201cin the roll\u201d and the decisions in reference to those words when used in the section as to assessment appeals. It appears to me that the fault in such submission is that it fails to take into account the fact that ss. 72 and 131 are dealing with entirely different things. Section 72 is concerned with an appeal from an assessment. An assessment is a valuation of certain property in the municipality. Section 131 deals with an application for abatement or refund of taxes. Taxes are demands for payment made by a municipality upon a ratepayer thereof. It is true that they are based upon an assessment but they are not an assessment; they are very different from an assessment. Therefore, I doubt the efficacy of any attempt to bring into the interpretation of the words of s. 131(1) of The Assessment Act any meaning for words established in reference to their use in s. 72, some 60 sections preceding the former in the statute. With respect, I adopt the description of s. 131 of The Assessment Act made by Schroeder J.A. in his reasons in the Court of Appeal:\nThat is a remedial section which empowers a court of revision to do essential justice to a taxpayer who has been overcharged by reason of any \u201cgross or manifest error\u201d, or who has suffered a loss\n* * *\nRe Blackburn and City of Ottawa[2] was concerned with the question of the right of appeal on an application under the then counterpart of s. 131. Middleton J.A. at p. 500 said, after having reviewed the history of the situation:\nFrom this history of the legislation several things emerge. The right of appeal from an assessment and the right to apply to the Court of Revision for a remission of taxes are and always have been entirely separate and distinct things.\nKinnear Co.Ct.J., in an attempt to ascertain the proper meaning and true function of s. 131(1)(f) of The Assessment Act, carried out a rather searching and astute investigation of the history of the section. That section first appeared in the Statutes of Canada 1852-53, 16 Vict., c. 182, s. 29. The relevant words of that statute were:\nby reason of any gross and manifest error in the Roll as finally passed by the Court, shall have been overcharged more than twenty-five per cent\u2026\nThere was no change in the relevant wording until 1904 when, by 4 Edw. VII, c. 23, s. 112, now of course of the Province of Ontario, the words were revised by the deletion therefrom, firstly, of the words \u201cas finally passed by the Court\u201d and secondly, of the words \u201cmore than twenty-five per cent on the sum he ought to have been charged\u201d. So that the relevant portion of the section then read:\nby reason of any gross and manifest error in the roll, has been overcharged\u2026 Those words again remained unamended for eighteen years. In 1922, by 12-13 Geo. V, c. 78, s. 26, the important amendment was made whereby the word \u201cand\u201d was changed to the word \u201cor\u201d so that then the relevant portion of the section read:\nby reason of any gross or manifest error in the roll has been overcharged\u2026\nSeven years later, in 1929, by 19 Geo. V, c. 63, s. 7, the word \u201cassessment\u201d was added so that the relevant portion of the section read:\nwho by reason of any gross or manifest error in the assessment roll has been overcharged\u2026\nThe final amendment was made in the year 1944 by 8 Geo. VI, c. 7, s. 15, in which the words \u201cin the assessment roll\u201d were deleted so that thereafter and now the section reads:\nwho is overcharged by reason of any gross or manifest error.\nI am of the opinion that this survey of the course of amendments through the years demonstrates clearly that the legislature has intended a remedy to the taxpayer and that the scope of that remedy has been steadily broadened through the years to that provided in the present section. Firstly, the word \u201cgross\u201d has been limited by the provision that the overcharge had to amount to twenty-five per cent, a plain indication that the word \u201cgross\u201d as used there had reference to the amount of the overcharge. Secondly, in 1922, the words \u201cgross and manifest\u201d were amended to read \u201cgross or manifest\u201d. The word \u201cor\u201d is simply a co-ordinate that creates an alternative while the word \u201cand\u201d on the other hand is a conjunction and would require that the error, in order to give the remedy, must be both gross and manifest. After the amendment, I therefore agree with the learned County Court judge when she said in her reasons:\nUnder the present wording of the section, however, the appellant does not need to show that the error is manifest in the assessment roll, the words now being simply \u201cwho is overcharged by reason of any gross or manifest error\u201d\n* * *\nand\nAll the appellant is required to do therefore is to show that the error was \u201cgross\u201d\u2026\nIt needs no authority to state that a statute should be interpreted giving the words their ordinary English meaning unless, from the context, some other meaning is required. The Shorter Oxford Dictionary gives several definitions of \u201cgross\u201d as an adjective and the first and, I think, the most frequently used is \u201cthick, stout, massive, big\u201d. The Legislature was of the opinion at first that the overcharge had to be \u201cbig\u201d to the extent of twenty-five per cent. The Legislature then altered its view and by the elimination of the words describing the percentage expressed the view that an overcharge that was not as high as twenty-five per cent might nevertheless be \u201cgross\u201d and entitle the taxpayer to the remedy. In the present case, the overcharge, as judged by the result of the assessment appeal, was in the order of fifty per cent which, even under the section as it existed in the prior time, would certainly have been \u201cgross\u201d.\nFor these reasons, I adopt, with respect, the view of Schroeder J.A. as expressed in his reasons in the Court of Appeal for Ontario:\nIn our opinion the Board has placed altogether too narrow a construction on s. 131(1)(f) and we greatly prefer the reasoning of the learned County Court Judge with which we are in substantial agreement.\nI am also in substantial agreement and I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting)\u2014In these proceedings, the respondent Interlake Tissue Mills Co. Limited is claiming a refund of taxes paid in 1960 on its 1959 assessment. Its property was then in the Town of Merritton but is now included in the City of St. Catharines. Interlake did not appeal its 1959 assessment. The assessment roll was confirmed in due course and became the basis for the 1960 taxation. When Interlake received its 1960 assessment notice it did appeal, with the ultimate result that it achieved a very substantial reduction of approximately 50 per cent. It next took proceedings on February 10, 1961, under s. 131(1)(f) of The Assessment Act for a refund of taxes paid in the year 1960 on the 1959 assessment on the ground that there had been a gross or manifest error. Section 131(1) reads:\n131. (1) An application to the court of revision for the cancellation, reduction or refund of taxes levied in the year in- respect of which the application is made may be made by any person,\n(a) in respect of real property liable to taxation at the rate levied under subsection 2 of section 294 of The Municipal Act that has ceased to be real property that would be liable to be taxed at such rate; or\n* * *\n(c) in respect of real property that has become exempt from taxation during the year or during the preceding year after the return of the assessment roll; or\n(d) in respect of a building that was razed by fire, demolition or otherwise during the year or during the preceding year after the return of the assessment roll; or\n(e) who is unable to pay taxes because of sickness or extreme poverty; or\n(f) who is overcharged by reason of any gross or manifest error; or\n(g) liable for business tax who has not carried on business for the whole year, except where the business was intended to be or was capable of being carried on during a part of the year only, or was not carried on for a period of less than three months during the year by reason of repairs to or renovations of the premises in which the business was carried on.\nThese refund proceedings went through the Court of Revision, County Court, the Municipal Board, and the Court of Appeal, and are now before us. The County Court judge allowed the appeal because of an over-assessment in 1959 and directed the refund to Interlake of that part of the 1960 taxes attributable to the over-assessment. The Municipal Board allowed the appeal and held that the over-assessment in question here did not come within the terms of s. 131(1)(f) as being gross or manifest error. The Court of Appeal[3] restored the judgment of the County Court judge.\nThe appeal provisions in The Assessment Act against the assessment are clear and unambiguous. Within the time limits fixed by the Act, an appeal from an assessment may be taken to a Court of Revision, a County Court, the Ontario Municipal Board and, finally, to the Court of Appeal. Section 72(1) gives one of the grounds of appeal as \u201cundercharged or overcharged.\u201d This is the language used when the person assessed appeals. There is a similar appeal given to any person who thinks that someone else has been \u201cassessed too low or too high.\u201d There is no difference, in my opinion, between \u201cundercharged or overcharged\u201d and \u201cassessed too low or too high.\u201d The appeal under s. 72 is, therefore, in the widest terms. It deals with what I have just mentioned and error or omission. In my opinion, when this is the complaint, this procedure must be followed and when the roll is certified by the Court of Revision, it is for all purposes the last revised assessment roll of the municipality (s. 57(1)) subject to the preservation of the rights of appeal under the Act (s. 57(6)).\nThe taxpayer in this case failed to take advantage of these rights of appeal against the 1959 assessment. But, having secured a substantial reduction by way of appeal of the 1960 assessment, it then sought to take advantage of s. 131(1)(f) on the ground that it had been overcharged by reason of \u201cgross or manifest error.\u201d\nMany cases, notably Town of MacLeod v. Campbell[4], Shannon Realties Ltd. v. Ville de St. Michel[5], and North West Lumber Co. Ltd. v. Municipal District of Lockerbie No. 580[6], lay down the firm principle that in the case of overvaluation by the assessor, appeal by the taxpayer must be made according to the procedure and subject to the limitations laid down in the gov- erning statute. In any given case, the procedure and limitations have always been almost identical to the requirements laid down by s. 72 of The Assessment Act. To allow in the case under appeal utilization of s. 131 of that Act in an appeal against a subjective error, would be to ignore what has been long accepted law.\nSection 131 deals with specific situations such as property that has become exempt from taxation during the course of the year, buildings razed by fire and persons who are unable to pay taxes because of sickness or extreme poverty. It goes on to make specific provision for the person \u201cwho is overcharged by reason of any gross or manifest error.\u201d\nSection 131, having regard to its place in the scheme of the Act, does not apply to situations where the issue concerns details of the principle of valuation applied by the assessor, nor situations where the question is undervalue or overvalue. Rather, it applies to clerical errors, the transposition of figures, typographical errors and this type of mistake.\nThe \u201cgross error\u201d relied on by Interlake in the present circumstances is the reliance of the assessor upon a manual prepared for use in Lincoln County (which he used to assess all industrial properties) rather than upon a manual prepared and recommended by the Ontario Department of Municipal Affairs, incorporating as it does specific reference to the criteria set up by The Assessment Act, s. 35.\nThe essence of the complaint made by the taxpayer on the \u201crefund appeal\u201d is a complaint of having been \u201covercharged by the assessor\u201d (the very words used in s. 72(1)). The property owner must make this complaint within the time prescribed for appeal to the Court of Revision, and further appeals, if advised, within the other time limits. The taxpayer is not given the privilege of ignoring the time prescribed for appeal to the Court of Revision and then coming back to that Court through s. 131.\nIf the reasoning of the Court of Appeal is correct, every taxpayer who can establish a substantial difference between his valuation and the valuation of the assessor, can ignore the ordinary procedure and stand by while the roll is certified by the Court of Revision, the tax levy made on the basis of that roll, and then, early in the next year, prior to February 28, bring forward his complaint.\nSuch a result is at variance with the whole scheme of the Act, which is that the municipality, at the beginning of the tax year, has a certified roll on which it can rely in making this levy. Section 131 does not duplicate, in whole or in part, the appeal provisions of s. 72. There is no connection between the two sections and they deal with different problems. The first is the regular appeal procedure (s. 72). The second (s. 131) deals with the state of the roll and has nothing to do with the quantum of assessment validly made. When s. 131 is invoked the taxes are being levied on \u201cthe last revised assessment roll\u201d of the previous year, (57(1) and 57(4)). At this stage, the assessor\u2019s error in judgment, if any, of over-assessment cannot be attacked. The section is applicable to the correction of a mistake of fact in the making of the assessment or placing it on the roll. This was the ratio of the Municipal Board. This ratio is also in accordance with the reasons of Riddell J.A. in Re Bayack[7], where the error complained of was a change in tenancy and religious affiliation between the making of the assessment and the final revision of the roll. We have not been referred to any case where the section has been applied on a complaint of over-assessment. I wish to adopt the reasons of the Board in the following paragraph:\nThere must of necessity be some finality and a time when it can be said that the assessed value of the property for that year has been determined except in those special and unique circumstances where there was a gross or manifest error of fact in the making of the assessment or placing same on the roll. This not only applies to when a person is requesting special relief from over-charging but also on an application by the municipality under s. 132(1) when any person is undercharged by reason of any gross or manifest error. It is the opinion of the Board that this special curative relief is for the purposes of correcting a mistake of fact and not when an error of judgment in making the assessment is involved.\nI would allow the appeal with costs throughout, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the order of the Municipal Board.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Judson J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Seymour, Lampard, Nicholls & Greenspan, St. Catharines.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fasken & Calvin, Toronto.\n[1] [1968] 2 O.R. 589.\n[2] (1924), 55 O.L.R. 494.\n[3] [1968] 2 O.R. 589. -\n[4] (1918), 57 S.C.R. 517.\n[5] (1922), 64 S.C.R. 420, [1924] A.C. 185.\n[6] [1926] S.C.R. 155.\n[7] (1929), 64 O.L.R. 14.\n",

The officer approached the respondent\u2019s car and told him that he had a warrant for him. The respondent, who had started to move forward, accelerated but had to brake because of traffic. The officer ran up, reached in through the window and grabbed the respondent\u2019s shirt, saying \u201cyou are under arrest\u201d. The respondent accelerated, breaking the officer\u2019s hold on the shirt and on the car. The respondent was convicted after a trial by jury, on a charge of escaping from lawful custody contrary to s. 125(a) of the Criminal Code. The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction and directed that a verdict of acquittal be entered. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court where the sole question for determination was whether the respondent had been in lawful custody.\nHeld (Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.\nPer Fauteux, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.: The respondent was arrested, he escaped from lawful custody and was guilty under s. 125(a) of the Criminal Code. Arrest consists of the actual seizure or touching of a person\u2019s body with a view to his detention. A police officer has the right to use such force as may be necessary to make an arrest. There is no room for what seems to be a new subdivision of arrest into \u201ccustodial\u201d arrest and \u201csymbolical\u201d or \u201ctechnical\u201d arrest. Per Hall and Spence JJ., dissenting: The police officer had a lawful right and duty to arrest the respondent. The respondent accordingly was under a legal obligation to submit to the lawful arrest. It is not necessary to touch or hold the person being arrested. He must, of course, be informed that he is being arrested. If he does not submit or tries to flee, the arresting officer may use such force as may reasonably be necessary to detain his man having regard to the nature of the offence for which the person is wanted. If the man flees and is not in fact detained he cannot be said to have been in lawful custody. In these circumstances he is clearly guilty under s. 110(a) of the Criminal Code. Section 125(a) is not an included offence under s. 110(a) and vice versa.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], quashing the respondent\u2019s conviction and directing a verdict of acquittal. Appeal allowed, Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting.\nC.J. Meinhardt, for the appellant.\nDavid R.G. Griner and C.G. Stewart McKeown, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.\u2014The respondent, James Whitfield, was convicted on October 23, 1967, after a trial by jury, on a charge of escaping from lawful custody contrary to s. 125(a) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of six months definite and six months indeterminate. The Court of Appeal1 allowed his appeal, quashed the conviction and directed that a verdict of acquittal be entered. The appeal to this Court is by leave granted on January 29, 1969.\nThe ratio of the Court of Appeal is that Whitfield could not be convicted under s. 125(a) because he had never been \u201ccustodially arrested\u201d and that for a conviction there must be more than what is termed an \u201carrest in symbolical form\u201d. A distinction is drawn between an arrest amounting to custody and a mere or bare arrest. In some parts of the reasons of the Court of Appeal it is referred to as a \u201ctechnical arrest\u201d. It is said that the judge ought to have told the jury in view of the evidence in the case that it was not enough that there was an arrest by touching and that it was incumbent on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the constable had taken or captured the accused and that the accused had thereafter broken away. These propositions enunciated by the Court of Appeal are, in my opinion, erroneous.\nThe correct proposition of law is stated in 10 Hals., 3rd ed., p. 342, in these terms:\n631. MEANING OF ARREST. Arrest consists of the actual seizure or touching of a person\u2019s body with a view to his detention. The mere pronouncing of words of arrest is not an arrest, unless the person sought to be arrested submits to the process and goes with the arresting officer. An arrest may be made either with or without a warrant.\nThere is no room for what seems to be a new subdivision of \u201carrest\u201d into \u201ccustodial\u201d arrest and \u201csymbolical\u201d or \u201ctechnical\u201d arrest. An accused is either arrested or he is not arrested. If this accused was arrested, he escaped from lawful custody and is guilty under s. 125(a) of the Criminal Code.\nThe law on this matter was stated without qualification by the Court of Exchequer Chamber in Sandon v. Jervis and Dain[2]. This judgment was delivered in 1858 and was stating not a new principle but established law based on sound public policy. Pollock C.B., Williams J., Crowder J., Willes J. and Bramwell B., were all of the same opinion:\nIt is a matter of positive law whether a mere touch is to constitute an arrest or not. It might have been reasonably prescribed either that it should or should not be necessary to an arrest that there should be a possession of the person. But probably the reason which led to the laying down of the law as it stands was that it was thought desirable to avoid unnecessary violence; and therefore it was determined that, if the officer was near enough to the debtor to touch him, it was the duty of the debtor to submit; and this for the purpose of preventing conflict. I may remark parenthetically that what the law of England most aims at is the preservation of peace. It will not allow a man to take forcible possession of even his own property. But, whatever be the reason, the law is that, if the officer is near enough to the debtor to touch him, and does touch him, and gives him notice of the writ, it is an arrest. I can well understand the reason for its being so held.\nIt is true that this problem was under consideration in relation to an action against a sheriff by an execution creditor for permitting an execution debtor to escape from lawful custody. But the proposition of law stated by Pollock C.B., is not so limited in its application. Bramwell B., in his agreement with Pollack C.B., on the general proposition, introduced an element of qualification when the issue was the liability of the sheriff for permitting an escape. I quote his precise words:\nI am of the same opinion: but I wish to guard myself against being supposed to lay it down that the sheriff would be liable to an escape where the officer had been unable to do more than touch the debtor. The capture might be good as against the debtor so as to preclude him from saying that he had not been arrested, and yet not complete so as to make the sheriff liable for an escape... I wish not to be understood as asserting that the sheriff would have been liable for an escape if the debtor had got away after he had merely been touched.\nThis qualification which Bramwell B., alone wished to introduce was intended to ease the lot of the sheriff when sued for an escape. It does not touch the general proposition. It was not accepted by the other members of the Court and it had been argued and rejected in the earlier case of Nicholl v. Darley[3], where it was said that the cases \u201cabundantly show that the slightest touch is an arrest in point of law.\u201d\nIn Sandon v. Jervis and Dain the Court was, therefore, following long established authority based on sound principle which goes back at least as far as the judgment of Holt C.J., in Genner v. Sparks[4]. These authorities which have stood so long should not now be limited to a process which has become obsolete. The reason for the rule is equally compelling today as it was in the past. A police officer has the right to use such force as may be necessary to make an arrest. What kind of arrest are we to expect if it becomes a principle of law that a police officer, acting under a warrant of which he informs the accused, and who actually seizes the accused\u2019s person, is found not to have made an arrest because the accused is in the driver\u2019s seat of a motor car which enables him to shake off the arresting officer?\nI would allow the appeal and restore the conviction.\nThe judgment of Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by\nHALL J. (dissenting)\u2014The respondent, James Whitfield, was a person for whose arrest a warrant was outstanding. He was wanted with two others on a charge of having wilfully damaged three seat cushions in a restaurant some three weeks before. On June 10, 1967, he was driving a motor vehicle in an eastbound direction at the corner of St. Clair Avenue and Dufferin Street in the City of Toronto. At the same time, Constable Kerr, a member of the Toronto Police Force, who knew that a warrant for Whitfield\u2019s arrest was outstanding, was driving a police car accompanied by a fellow officer and at the intersection in question saw Whitfield who was then stopped for a red light. Kerr got out of the police car and approached Whitfield\u2019s car, and as he came to the car window Whitfield started to move forward, the light having changed to green. Kerr, who knew Whitfield, said through the open window: \u201cI have a warrant for you, Whitfield\u201d and added: \u201cStop the car and shut off the ignition\u201d. Whitfield accelerated, veering to the left across the centre line of St. Clair Avenue but had to brake abruptly because of westbound traffic. He then proceeded in the intersection and Kerr was unable to shout at or speak to the accused at that time. However Whitfield had to brake again in the middle of Dufferin Street because of traffic. Kerr ran up and groped for the ignition key while Whitfield moved forward again and continued to turn left. As Whitfield completed the turn to go north, travelling then at about 5 miles per hour, Kerr reached in through the window and grabbed Whitfield\u2019s shirt with both hands, saying, \u201cYou are under arrest\u201d, but Whitfield accelerated breaking Kerr\u2019s hold on the shirt and on the car. As Kerr\u2019s hold on the car was being broken, he was dragged a few feet and then fell to the pavement. At some time when he had hold of Whitfield\u2019s shirt, Kerr struck his neck on the frame of the car door, and when he fell to the pavement he sustained some bruises to an elbow joint and his right leg was injured. In the result he was unable to perform his duties as a police officer for three days. Whitfield was taken into custody a short time later at another location by two other police officers. He was indicted on October 23, 1967, under two counts as follows:\n1. The said jurors further present that James Edward Whitfield on or about the 10th day of June in the year 1967 at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York, by criminal negligence, caused bodily harm to one (Frederick) Kerr, contrary to the Criminal Code. (Amended Oct. 19, 1967 by Judge Sheppard)\n2. The said jurors further present that James Edward Whitfield on or about the 10th day of June in the year 1967 at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York, escaped from lawful custody, contrary to the Criminal Code.\nHe was tried before His Honour Judge Sheppard and a jury and found \u201cNot Guilty\u201d by the jury on Count 1 but \u201cGuilty\u201d under Count 2 and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six months definite and six months indefinite.\nWhitfield appealed on the ground that he could not be found guilty under s. 125(a) of the Criminal Code as he had not been in lawful custody at the time in question. The Court of Appeal[5] (Gale C.J.O., Laskin and Jessup JJ.A.) allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction and directed that an acquittal be entered on the charge of escaping from lawful custody.\nThe Crown applied and was given leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the terms that the Crown pay to the respondent his costs of the appeal in this Court, including the costs of the motion for leave, the whole on a solicitor and client basis in any event of the cause.\nThe sole question for determination is whether or not, on the facts as hereinbefore set out, Whitfield was, at the relevant time in question here, in lawful custody because it follows that unless he was in lawful custody he could not escape from lawful custody as the section states.\nIn the argument before this Court a great number of old English cases were cited dealing with whether an arrest had been effected or not in certain given circumstances. Virtually all the cases cited by counsel for the appellant as well as for the respondent had to do with the purported arrest of an execution debtor under a writ of capeas ad satisfaciendum usually known as a ca. sa. being the writ directed to a sheriff to take into custody an execution debtor and: \u201c\u2026 him safely keep so that the sheriff may have the body before the High Court of Justice to satisfy the execution creditor the amount payable under the judgment order.\u201d: Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 16, para. 98. This was a procedure frequently invoked before imprisonment for debt was abolished by the Debtors Act, (1869) 32-33 Vict., c. 62, s. 4. The ca. sa. writ is still theoretically available but has fallen out of use and is now regarded for practical purposes as obsolete: Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 16, footnote (g), p. 63. In the cases cited by counsel the action was against the sheriff either for not having taken the debtor into custody or for having allowed the debtor to escape when he might have been taken into custody. This was at a time when the common law favoured the man of property and a fictional or notional idea of what constituted an arrest under a ca. sa. writ was adopted by the courts as cases such as Nicholl v. Darley[6] show, and the sheriff who did not hold and keep the debtor once he touched him was held liable to the creditor. The extent to which the courts stretched the notional idea of arrest is illustrated by the rejection by the majority in Sandon v. Jervis and Dain[7] of the qualification which Bramwell B. sought to introduce in that case. In my view Nicholl v. Darley and Sandon v. Jervis and Dain cannot be accepted as establishing a principle of law applicable to situations arising 100 years after the situations to which they applied became obsolete. The dead hand of the past cannot reach that far. These outdated procedures evolved before the organization of police forces as we now know them and had no relation to the arrest or taking into custody of a person charged with a criminal offence.\nAccordingly in my view this case does not fall to be decided upon the authority of cases applicable to the taking into custody under writs of capeas ad satisfaciendum obsolete since 1869, civil in their nature, and not involving the criminal law doctrine of proof beyond a reasonable doubt but should be decided upon principles applicable to the circumstances obtaining in this century and particularly since Parliament has legislated in the very matter to cover both resisting lawful arrest and escaping from lawful custody as two distinct and separate offences.\nIn the instant case the police officer, Kerr, had a lawful right and duty to arrest Whitfield. There is no question as to the fact that a warrant was outstanding and Kerr\u2019s attempt to arrest was lawful. Whitfield accordingly was under a legal obligation to submit to the lawful arrest. It is only by the recognition of these corresponding duties and obligations that we can avoid the notion that the person being arrested has to be restrained physically before he can be said to be \u2018arrested\u2019. I do not see that it should be necessary to touch or hold the person being arrested. He must, of course, be informed that he is being arrested. If he does not submit or tries to flee, the arresting officer may use such force as may reasonably be necessary to detain his man having regard to the nature of the offence for which the person is wanted. If the man flees and is not in fact detained he cannot be said to have been in lawful custody, but that does not mean he has not committed an offence. Parliament has legislated specifically in this regard. In these circumstances he is clearly guilty under s. 110(a) which reads:\n110. Every one who\n(a) resists or wilfully obstructs a public officer or peace officer in the execution of his duty or any person lawfully acting in aid of such an officer,\n* * *\nis guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.\nParliament had to deal with two situations: (1) the arrest or taking of a person into custody when authorized by law; (2) the keeping of such a person in custody once he has been lawfully arrested and\/or sentenced. By creating two offences, the earlier dealing with the actual arrest or attempt to arrest and the later dealing with escaping from lawful custody, Parliament clearly recognized that the two situations were different and not interchangeable and Parliament must be presumed to have known that the words \u201carrest\u201d and \u201ccustody\u201d are not synonymous. Section 125(a) is not an included offence under s. 110(a) and vice versa. This becomes very clear from the wording of subss. (b) and (c) of s. 125 as distinct from the whole of s. 110 which patently deals with the arrest process itself and not with the custodial situation following upon a lawful arrest.\nI would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal with costs payable in accordance with the order for leave to appeal on the grounds above mentioned. The Crown should charge an accused with the actual offence it says he has committed. This is not asking too much of those in charge of prosecutions. Here Whitfield was avoiding arrest and should have been charged under s. 110(a) and would have been liable to imprisonment for two years. This is the sanction Parliament has provided for a person such as Whitfield, who at the wheel of a motor car, shakes off an arresting officer. He is made liable to the same punishment under s. 110(a) as is provided for in s. 125. Both offences are equally grave but distinct.\nAppeal allowed and conviction restored, HALL and SPENCE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: The Attorney General for Ontario, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.R.G.

Vancouver General Hospital et al., [1970] S.C.R. 477\nDate: 1969-12-22\nFrederick Albert Child, by his Committee, Mable Charity Wilce Child (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Vancouver General Hospital and Charleen Tennessy (Defendants) Respondents.\n1969: October 14, 15; 1969: December 22.\nPresent: Cartwright C.J. and Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nNegligence\u2014Hospital patient quiet after suffering several irrational spells\u2014Doctor\u2019s opinion that patient much improved and would continue to do well\u2014Nurse leaving for coffee break\u2014Patient escaping through window and sustaining injuries as result of fall\u2014Whether jury\u2019s verdict in favour of nurse perverse\u2014Whether misdirection of jury.\nThree days after the plaintiff had undergone an abdominal operation, from which he appeared to be recovering normally, his condition deteriorated and he was moved to a private room. The hospital directed three special nurses, one of whom was the second defendant T, to care for the plaintiff in eight-hour shifts. During his serious illness on the third, fourth and fifth day after the operation, the patient was, on many occasions, confused and disturbed. He was, from time to time, unaware of his surroundings and suffered from vivid hallucinations. When T came on duty on the morning of the fifth day, she noted that her patient was restless and confused. She sent for his doctor, but by the time of the latter\u2019s arrival, as had occurred on other occasions, the patient\u2019s confusion and restlessness seemed to have subsided. The doctor was of the opinion that he was much improved and that he would continue to do well.\nShortly after the doctor\u2019s visit, T left the patient, who at the time was restful and apparently sleeping, for her coffee break. When she returned some fifteen minutes later, she found that the patient had got out of bed and escaped through the window, falling into a canopy on a floor below. As a result of his fall, the plaintiff suffered serious and permanent injuries.\nThe plaintiff brought action against the hospital and T claiming damages in negligence. The action was tried before a judge and a jury and was dismissed. On appeal, the appeal was dismissed by a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal. On the appeal to the Court of Appeal and on appeal to this Court the appellant submitted that the jury\u2019s verdict was unreasonable and that the trial judge erred in directing the jury in certain important aspects.\nHeld (Cartwright C.J., and Spence J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The contention that the verdict was perverse could not be upheld and there was no misdirection of the jury by the trial judge. As held by the Court below, the issue of whether or not a possibility that the plaintiff might be overcome by his illness during T\u2019s absence for coffee (and by reason thereof do some irrational act to harm himself) was a real risk as opposed to an unlikely or farfetched possibility, was for and before the jury.\nTo suggest that T was negligent when the opinion upon which she acted coincided with that of the certified surgeon who was in charge of the case, was to ask more than was required of a reasonably careful and capable nurse.\nPer Cartwright C.J. and Spence J., dissenting: There was evidence upon which a jury acting judicially could have brought in a verdict for the defendants and, therefore, the appellant\u2019s first submission should be rejected. As to his second submission, the jury should have had pointed out to them T\u2019s admission that she had foreseen the danger and then the jury should have been instructed to answer the question as to whether T was guilty of negligence by determining whether, under all the circumstances, she acted as a reasonably prudent nurse should have acted when she chose to leave her patient for the purpose of enjoying a coffee break.\nThe jury were not led to a consideration of all the factors, but rather by repeated instructions were asked to consider the irrelevant elements under the circumstances of the reasonable foreseeability of the patient harming himself in an irrational episode.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from a judgment of Aikens J. pronounced after trial with a jury. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright C.J. and Spence J. dissenting.\nW.J. Wallace, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nD.B. MacKinnon and M.P. Ragona, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of Cartwright C.J. and Spence J. was delivered by\nSPENCE J. (dissenting)\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1 pronounced on December 11, 1968. By that judgment, the said Court dismissed an appeal from the judgment of Aikins J. pronounced on June 26, 1967, after trial of the action with a jury.\nBefore dealing with the grounds of appeal, it is necessary to outline the facts in some particular detail.\nFrederick Albert Child, a customs officer of about fifty years of age, underwent a very serious abdominal operation in the Vancouver General Hospital on May 12, 1964. He appeared to be recovering normally from such operation but on May 15 his condition deteriorated and he was moved to a private room and then, after a con- ference between the surgeon and the medical staff, the hospital directed three special nurses in eight-hours shifts to care for the plaintiff. These three staff nurses were employed solely to give care to Mr. Child and to no other patient. During his very serious illness on the 15th, 16th and 17th of May, Mr. Child was, on many occasions, \u201cconfused\u201d and \u201cdisturbed\u201d, to use the words which appeared in the records of the hospital. He was, from time to time, unaware of his surroundings and suffered from vivid hallucinations.\nThe defendant Charleen Tennessy had acted as a special nurse for the plaintiff on May 16 from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. During that day, she observed the plaintiff\u2019s serious condition. The plaintiff had an intravenous needle strapped to his arm, a Levine tube leading from his nose to his stomach, extensive dressings, a Penrose drain inserted in his wound, and his abdomen was grossly distended. Nurse Tennessy observed fecal smelling fluid exuding from the still open wound. During that day, Nurse Tennessy observed and noted on the chart that the plaintiff had periods of confusion, great discomfort and unrest. Nurse Tennessy returned to duty on May 17 a few minutes before 7 a.m. and went over the notes of the special nurse who had been on duty from 11 p.m. on May 16 until 7 a.m. on the 17th. Nurse Tennessy acknowledged that she had observed these entries in such notes:\n11:30 p.m.\u2014Seems quite restless and confused with visual hallucinations frequently.\n12:00 p.m.\u2014Very restless.\n1:00 a.m.\u2014Confused, rambling.\n5:00 a.m.\u2014Moderately confused and hallucinations persist.\n6:15 a.m.\u2014Restless, hallucinating vividly, jumpy and anxious.\nTherefore, Miss Tennessy had notice of the fact that only three-quarters of an hour before she assumed her duties on that morning the plaintiff was restless, had been hallucinating vividly, was jumpy and anxious. Nurse Tennessy\u2019s first note in her chart at 7:00 a.m. on the 17th of May was: \u201cSeems more confused and restless this morning.\u201d Nurse Tennessy proceeded with her nursing services, bathing her patient, changing the linen on the bed, and changing the dressing. These services, however, had not succeeded in causing the patient to subside as, during the course of them, Mr. Child suddenly sat up in bed and attempted to climb out of bed. Nurse Tennessy easily prevented this by gently pushing her patient back into a prone position. At that time, Mr. Child was restless, confused and quite unaware of the circumstances that there were attached to his body no fewer than three tubes\u2014one in his arm, one in his nose, and one in the wound.\nMay 17 was a Sunday and Nurse Tennessy testified that she was not sure that the surgeon, Dr. White, would visit the patient that morning. Therefore, she telephoned to him at 8:30 a.m. requesting that he do so and during such telephone call she informed Dr. White of her observations. That telephone conversation was heard by another employee of the hospital, Mrs. Engel, who was the head nurse in the ward. Perhaps, as a result thereof, Mrs. Engel also visited Mr. Child at 8:45 a.m. and observed his confused and restless condition. Dr. White arrived at the hospital at 9:00 a.m. and went directly to Mr. Child\u2019s room. By that time, as had occurred on other occasions, Mr. Child\u2019s confusion and restlessness seemed to have subsided and Dr. White testified that he seemed to be very much better, and that at that time he, Dr. White, had complete confidence that Mr. Child would continue to do well and he did not feel that Mr. Child would become confused again. The fact, however, remains that over the whole of the previous twenty-four hours or more Mr. Child had alternated between periods in which his progress seemed to be quite normal and he seemed quite relaxed and periods when he became confused, restless and vividly hallucinating. Dr. White completed his examination and left the patient\u2019s room and Nurse Tennessy accompanied him to the supervisor\u2019s desk. It is to be noted that this was the second occasion on which Nurse Tennessy left the patient that morning, firstly, to telephone Dr. White and, secondly, to walk with Dr. White from the room to the nursing station. It should also be noted that both of those absences were momentary.\nWhen Nurse Tennessy returned to the patient\u2019s room, she found Mr. Child quiet and apparently asleep. She then again departed to go to one of the lower floors and have her usual morning cup of coffee. This would appear to have occurred at about 9:25 a.m. As Nurse Tennessy left her patient\u2019s room, she stopped at the nursing station and informed the acting head nurse who was at the station that she, Miss Tennessy, was going on her coffee break. The acting head nurse was not Mrs. Engel, who herself was absent from the floor at the time. Nurse Tennessy did not request such acting head nurse to watch her patient or attend him in any way and there is no evidence that she had any knowledge of Mr. Child\u2019s condition.\nNurse Tennessy was only absent from her patient for fifteen minutes but when she returned to the room she discovered it was empty, the window was open and some bedding had been tied around the leg of an arm chair and was hanging over the ledge of the window. Looking out the window, she observed the patient on the roof of a canopy two floors below. Although the plaintiff lived, he suffered very serious and permanent injuries, and it would appear he will be completely incapacitated for the rest of his life.\nThe plaintiff, acting through his wife as Committee, sued the Vancouver General Hospital and Charleen Tennessy claiming damages in negligence. It was agreed by all parties that there was no liability upon the hospital based on any fault in its procedures or treatment and that it was only liable if the defendants Tennessy and Mrs. Engel were negligent in the performance of their duties and were servants of the hospital so as to make that defendant vicariously liable.\nBull J.A., giving the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, said:\nIt was not challenged, and was found by the jury, that the special nurse, the respondent Tennessy, was employed by the respondent hospital and at all material times was acting within the scope of and in the course of her employment.\nThat admission was repeated in argument in this Court. For reasons which will appear later, I need not be concerned with the status of Mrs. Engel although she was equally an employee of the hospital and was at all material times acting within the scope of such employment.\nThe question of the vicarious liability of the hospital was the subject-matter of the first and third questions put by the learned trial judge to the jury. In light of the above, I need not deal further with those questions. The second question put by the learned trial judge to the jury, and the all-important one for the purpose of this appeal, was:\nQ. Was Nurse Tennessy guilty of negligence which caused or contributed to Mr. Child\u2019s injuries? Answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d.\nThe jury answered that question in the negative, as well as a like question, No. 4, dealing with the possible negligence of Mrs. Engel. The jury then did not proceed to deal with the question of damages. It may be of some interest to note that the jury\u2019s answers to questions 2 and 4 were not unanimous but six of the eight answered in the negative in each case. Under the statutory provisions in British Columbia, if a jury has been absent for a certain length of time, which had elapsed in this case, the judge may recall it and inform the members thereof that three-quarters of their number may agree upon the answer to a question. Three-quarters of eight, the number on a jury, is, of course, six.\nThe appellant submitted to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia and submits also to this Court, that there are two main errors which resulted in the verdict: firstly, that the verdict was unreasonable and, secondly, that the learned trial judge erred in directing the jury in certain important aspects. The first of those reasons may be dealt with rather briefly. As Bull J.A. pointed out in his reasons in the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, the principles upon which an appellate court must act when it is asked to reverse the verdict of a jury are well settled. Those principles have been stated in this Court from time to time and particularly in Canadian National Railways v. Mullen[2], where Duff C.J.C. said at p. 769:\nWe premise that it is not the function of this Court, as it was not the duty of the Court of Appeal, to review the findings of fact at which the jury arrived. Those findings are conclusive unless they are so wholly unreasonable as to show that the jury could not have been acting judicially.\nThat view was restated by Duff C.J.C. in McCannell v. McLean[3]. It was again cited by Rinfret J. in Coca-Cola Co. of Canada Ltd. v. Forbes[4], and by Hall J. in Byron v. Williams[5].\nIn the present case, there was evidence upon which a jury could have answered questions 2 and 4 in the negative and, therefore, have found for the defendant, and have acted judicially in so doing. Without canvassing that evidence at length, the opinion of Dr. White after his examination of the patient at 9:00 a.m. on the day of the accident, to which I have referred, may be cited as well as the fact that the defendant Tennessy had left her patient without any untoward event on two previous occasions on the morning of May 17 and on six or eight occasions during the course of her duties on May 16, and that when she did leave her patient on the occasion when the catastrophe occurred she left him resting quietly and apparently asleep. There was, in addition, Dr. White\u2019s testimony that he was of the opinion that the drug which had been prescribed for the patient and which he had been taking until that morning might have caused those disturbing symptoms and he instructed a change in that drug. Other items of evidence could be cited but it is sufficient to say that on items which I have recited above and on other items, a jury acting judicially could have brought in a verdict for the defendants. I am, therefore, not ready to accept the appellant\u2019s first submission, and I would not hold that the verdict was unreasonable and should be quashed. The second submission made by the appellant is much more important and much more difficult. The learned trial judge instructed the jury in a very long, very carefully thought out and very detailed charge. The jury returned with questions and the judge recharged the jury, again carefully and extensively. Under such circumstances, one would not expect to find a fault in the charge sufficient to justify the allowing of the appeal and the directing of a new trial. This is more especially true when one reads the core of the learned trial judge\u2019s charge as to negligence where he said:\nI have described the first element in negligence to you: that is, the duty to take care. I now go on to the second element. Before there can be negligence there must be a breach of the duty to use reasonable care which I have just described. A breach of the duty, I have stated, may be by an act of omission or by an act of commission. That is, putting it perhaps a little more simply, the breach may lie in doing something, or in failing to do something, which a reasonably careful nurse in the one case would not have done, or in the other case would have done. You may find nurse Tennessy negligent if, and only if, you are satisfied that she did something which in all the circumstances a nurse using reasonable care would not have done, or that she omitted to do something which in all the circumstances a nurse using reasonable care would have done.\nWith respect, I entirely agree with this instruction. It is the submission of the appellant, however, that the learned trial judge proceeded from that general instruction on negligence to deal in detail with how the jury should determine if the nurse had, in all the circumstances, done something which a nurse using reasonable care would not have done, for, when the trial judge turned to this issue, he instructed the jury not once but on many occasions that the test was whether the nurse should have reasonably foreseen that it was unsafe to leave her patient. The learned trial judge said:\nThe contention, as I understand it, is that Miss Tennessy was negligent in leaving her patient un- attended, because if she had used reasonable care, and considered the knowledge she had of the patient, including her knowledge that he attempted to get out of bed, if you find that that is what he did in fact attempt to do, she should have reasonably foreseen that it was unsafe to leave him alone. Shortly, the case against Miss Tennessy is that in all the circumstances, if she had used reasonable care, she ought to have reasonably foreseen that it was unsafe to leave Mr. Child unattended.\nAnd again,\nOf course, if you find negligence on the part of Miss Tennessy on the basis of the case of the plaintiff, as I understand it, namely that if she had used reasonable care, she should have foreseen that the patient might have another period of irrationality, and if left alone in such period might injure himself because of irrationality, then of course you have to use the same basis for determining whether or not the damage resulting from the negligence was too remote; and the latter question will probably cause you no great difficulty at all.\nNow in directing you on negligence, I have spoken about the plaintiff\u2019s case, which essentially is that Miss Tennessy ought to have known, because it was reasonably foreseeable on the information she had, that Child might have another period of irrationality, and if left alone might, during such period, injure himself, and she failed in using reasonable care in looking after this patent because she left him without making sure someone else was with him while she was away, so that her patient would not come to harm while alone.\nThen, in his recharge, the learned trial judge said to the jury:\nBefore you may find Miss Tennessy negligent, you must be satisfied that a nurse using reasonable care, and having the knowledge of the case which Miss Tennessy had, would have reasonably foreseen that Mr. Child might have another irrational period, and that if left alone he might during such irrational period injure himself.\nand he repeated those very words within a few moments. This recharge was made despite the vigorous argument of counsel for the appellant that there was no question about foreseeability. It was admitted that the defendant Tennessy foresaw the possibility and the risk. The explanation would appear to lie in the answer of the learned trial judge to such submission when he said:\nI don\u2019t think that it went quite this far, that she said that she in fact had both those things in mind at the time. Surely it is a matter of her saying, really, now, in retrospect, \u201cI agree, looking at it, that either one or the other might have happened.\u201d\nIn my opinion, this was a serious misunderstanding of the evidence of the defendant Tennessy in cross-examination. On not one but many occasions, she admitted that she had realized that it was possible for a patient such as Mr. Child, who had been suffering restlessness, confusion and irrational episodes on not infrequent occasions during the period of more than twenty-four hours, to have a repetition of such an episode and to do himself harm. It is perfectly true that the defendant Tennessy was of the opinion that there would not be a repetition of such an episode. She said quite frankly in her evidence that if she had been of the opinion that such an episode would be repeated, as distinguished from might be repeated, she would simply have remained in her room and could most easily have controlled such an episode as she did only an hour and a quarter before she left the room. It was, therefore, the admission of the defendant Tennessy that not only was such an occurrence reasonably foreseeable but that she had foreseen it, and I quote here her exact words:\nI assumed that he wouldn\u2019t go into one of these states.\nTherefore, I am in accord with the submission made by counsel for the appellant that under these circumstances detailed instructions to the jury upon the question of reasonable foreseeability were irrelevant and unnecessary. The jury should have had pointed out to them the defendant Tennessy\u2019s admission that she had foreseen the danger and then the jury should have been instructed to answer question No. 2 by determining whether, under all the circumstances, she acted as a reasonably prudent nurse should have acted when she chose to leave her patient for the purpose of enjoying a coffee break. The jury should have been instructed that they had to consider all of the circumstances not only that the defendant Tennessy had foreseen the risk but that the defendant Tennessy also knew of her patient\u2019s restful and apparently sleeping state when she left him, of the doctor\u2019s verbal prognosis made a few moments before, and of the other occasions when she had left her patient without any harm occurring, but also the circumstances of the frequent irrational episodes during the previous night and day.\nI am further of the opinion that it is proper for a jury in considering whether the actions of the defendant Tennessy were those of a reasonably prudent nurse under all of the circumstances to consider the ease by which injury from a possible recurrence of irrationality could have been avoided, i.e., by remaining in the room herself or requesting someone else on the staff to keep an eye on her patient, and also the necessity or lack of it for the nurse\u2019s departure from the room. I realize that the doctor\u2019s instructions had not called for 24-hour surveillance but it is within the jury\u2019s proper consideration to determine whether even lacking such instructions, in view of the circumstances which existed at the time and for the previous period, a reasonably prudent nurse would have exercised a surveillance perhaps less than a constant 24-hour surveillance but more carefully than that which the defendant Tennessy did exercise. Overseas Tankship (U.K.) Ltd. v. The Miller Steamship Co. Pty. (The Wagon Mound, No. 2)[6], per Lord Reid at pp. 718-19; Watt v. Hertfordshire County Council[7], per Lord Denning at p. 371.\nComing, as I do, to the conclusion that the jury were not led to the consideration of these factors but rather by repeated instructions were asked to consider the irrelevant elements under the circumstances which existed in this case of the reasonable foreseeability of the patient harming himself in an irrational episode, I am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed and that a new trial should be directed. Governor and Company of Adventurers of England Trading into Hudson\u2019s Bay v. Wyrzykowski et al.[8], per Hudson J. at p. 292; Swadling v. Cooper[9], per Lord Hailsham, at p. 10.\nI would allow the appellant\u2019s costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal for British Columbia and I would direct that the costs of the first trial be in the discretion of the judge presiding at a second trial.\nThe judgment of Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.\u2014This is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[10] dismissing an appeal by the appellant from a judgment rendered by Aikins J. sitting with a jury, which dismissed the appellant\u2019s claim for damages allegedly occasioned through the negligence of the respondent Nurse Tennessy and the Vancouver General Hospital.\nAfter careful consideration of the very thorough arguments of counsel, I have concluded that there is nothing which I can usefully add to the reasons for judgment delivered by Bull J.A. on behalf of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia with which I am in full agreement.\nFor the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Bull, I am of opinion that the appellant\u2019s contention that the jury\u2019s verdict was perverse cannot be upheld and that there was no misdirection of the jury by the learned trial judge.\nSince writing the above, I have had the opportunity of reading the reasons for judgment of my brother Spence, with which the Chief Justice has indicated his concurrence, and I think it desirable that I should express myself more fully.\nThe negligence alleged against the plaintiff\u2019s special nurse, Charleen Tennessy, centers around the fact that after having noted that her patient was restless and confused when she first came on duty on the 17th of May, she sent for his doctor and that after the doctor had interviewed him, she left her patient alone for 15 or 20 minutes to go and have her morning cup of coffee and on her return found that he had got out of bed and escaped through the window falling into a canopy on the floor below.\nAt the outset it appears to me to be important to appreciate, as my brother Spence did, that Nurse Tennessy\u2019s duties did not require her to be in the room with her patient at all times. In this regard Dr. White, who was the surgeon in charge of Mr. Child\u2019s case, was asked:\nQ. \u2026You knew he was not getting constant surveillance?\nA. If this constant surveillance means someone in the room with him at all times, I knew that he was not.\nIt was submitted on behalf of the appellant that, in light of the evidence, this case should have been left to the jury on the basis that when the nurse left the room to go for her coffee, she knew that there was a real risk of her patient having another hallucinatory spell and doing harm to himself. On this basis it was contended that the real issue was whether, as Miss Tennessy appreciated this risk, she was acting as a reasonably careful and capable nurse in leaving her patient for the purpose of her own convenience. Looked upon in this light, it was urged by counsel for the appellant that the learned trial judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury along these lines was in effect a failure to charge them as to the basis of the appellant\u2019s case and that the question of foreseeability as such was of secondary importance compared to that of balancing a known risk, although even slight, against personal convenience. My brother Spence appears to adopt this argument but with the greatest respect, I do not share the views which he expressed concerning Miss Tennessy\u2019s knowledge of the existence of a known risk. In this regard my brother Spence said:\nIt was, therefore, the admission of the defendant Tennessy that not only was such an occurrence rea- sonably foreseeable but that she had foreseen it, and I quote here her exact words:\n\u201cI assumed that he wouldn\u2019t go into one of these states.\u201d\nTherefore, I am in accord with the submission made by counsel for the appellant that under these circumstances detailed instructions to the jury upon the question of reasonable foreseeability were irrelevant and unnecessary.\nIn questioning Miss Tennessy on cross-examination about her leaving the room for the coffee break, counsel for the appellant repeatedly invited her to state whether or not at that time she assumed that her patient was going to go into another \u201cconfused state\u201d. At first Miss Tennessy replied \u201cWe try not to assume things\u201d, and she then indicated that she might assume one way or the other. Finally, however, counsel elicited the following answers:\nQ. Now, in view of that background you, as a specialist, special nurse, would you continue your services or treatment\u2014not treatment, service, nursing service on the assumption that he might go into one of these stages at any time, or would you base your nursing services on the assumption that he would not go into one of these conditions?\nA. I would assume an hour and a half later the fact that he was resting quietly, his doctor had visited him, his dressings had been changed, he had had a bowel movement and passed his water, he had had a bath, his linen had been changed, he appeared to be sleeping when I left, had answered the doctor\u2019s questions lucidly, I would assume that he would be perfectly safe while I went for my coffee.\nQ. All right. So you made the assumption, then, in going for your coffee that the patient would not go into one of these confused states that he had been in in increasing frequency during the night?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Is that correct? I see. And had you made, rendered your nursing services on any other assumption, namely, that he might go into one of these confused states you would not have gone for coffee at that time, is that correct?\nA. Well, if I had thought that, of course I wouldn\u2019t have gone for my coffee.\nI do not think that this amounts to anything more than an expression of Miss Tennessy\u2019s opinion that she did not consider it to be within the bounds of reasonable probability that Mr. Child would have a recurrence of one of his \u201cconfused states\u201d and do himself harm while she was away. In this regard her opinion coincided with that of Dr. White who was asked:\nMR. MACKINNON: Q. Doctor, from your knowledge of this case, more particularly your observations that you made on the morning of May 17th, at about 9 a.m., did you form a medical opinion as to the probability of what the patient might do if left unattended for 15 minutes at approximately 9.25 a.m.?\nA. I had at that time complete confidence that he would continue to do well.\nTHE COURT: Just a minute, please.\nA. Because he was so lucid I did not feel he would become confused again.\nIn the course of his cross-examination, Dr. White gave the following answers:\nQ. Yes. And you felt that his improvement was considerable and that his confusion had diminished very rapidly?\nA. Had disappeared.\nQ. Disappeared or diminished\u2014oh, is that it, disappeared?\nA. Yes.\nAt an earlier stage in his examination, the doctor had said of the patient\u2019s condition on the morning of the 17th: \u201cI felt he was much improved. I felt that all our troubles were over\u201d.\nIn relation to the evidence as to \u201creal risk\u201d, I adopt the language of Bull J.A. in the Court of Appeal where he said:\nThat the evidence referred to does constitute appreciation or knowledge of a real risk at the time and place in question is far from clear and it was for the jury alone to consider and weigh and determine its meaning and extent. I am satisfied that the issue of whether or not a possibility that the appellant might be overcome by his illness during Nurse Tennessy\u2019s absence for coffee (and by reason thereof do some irrational act to harm himself) was a \u201creal risk\u201d as opposed to an unlikely or farfetched possibility, was for and before the jury. I do not find it necessary to discuss the effect of the cases of Overseas Tankship (U.K.) Ltd. v. The Miller Steamship Co. Pty. (The Wagon Mound, No. 2)[11], or Bolton v. Stone[12], because, as I have indicated, I am satisfied that Mr. Justice Bull has correctly stated the law relating to the circumstances of this case.\nI think it desirable to stress the fact that the question of liability in the present case is to be determined in light of the circumstances as they existed immediately before Miss Tennessy left the room to go for her coffee break. After an accident it is all too easy to approach the question of fault in light of the event which has happened, and with the greatest respect, it appears to me that such an approach is reflected in the argument made on behalf of the appellant.\nTo suggest that Miss Tennessy was negligent when the opinion upon which she acted coincided with that of the certified surgeon who was in charge of the case, is, in my opinion, to ask more than is required of a reasonably careful and capable nurse.\nAs I have indicated, for all these reasons I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, CARTWRIGHT C.J. and SPENCE J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Bull, Housser & Tupper, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Harper, Gilmour, Grey & Co., Vancouver.\n[1] (1968), 67 W.W.R. 169, 2 D.L.R.

S provided a performance bond issued by the defendant T in the amount of $896,723. S began operations in September 1958 and suspended them in February, alleging that it was unable to continue because of severe snow conditions. After negotiations with F and P, S resumed work but eventually abandoned all work, alleging breach of contract. F and P instituted the present action against T as S\u2019s surety claiming the full amount of the performance bond. The trial judge and the Court of Appeal found that S was in default and was liable for the damages, and also that T was liable under its performance bond. The trial judge awarded an amount of $820,332.10, but this was reduced by the Court of Appeal to $606,873.80. The defendant T appealed to this Court and the plaintiffs F and P cross appealed. Held: The appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed.\nThere was ample evidence to support the findings of the two Courts as to liability, and they should not be disturbed.\nT\u2019s contention that the claim of F and P for overhead, calculated at 30.62 per cent of direct costs, was excessive, must be rejected. There was evidence upon which the trial judge and the majority in the Court of Appeal could make the finding which they did as to the basis upon which overhead was calculated.\nThere are concurrent findings that S was not entitled to an additional credit for grubbing done outside areas designated by the owner.\nThe obligations undertaken by F and P in a subsequent agreement to increase the unit price for clearing were conditional obligations within the meaning of art. 1079 of the Civil Code and never took effect. It follows that the subcontract was not amended.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Robinson J. Appeal dismissed and cross-appeal allowed.\nWalter C. Leggat, Q.C., and Joseph Nuss, for the defendant, appellant.\nRuston B. Lamb, Q.C., and Pierre S\u00e9bastien, for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nABBOTT J.\u2014This appeal is from a majority judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench (Appeal Side)1, rendered on July 26, 1968, allowing the appellant\u2019s appeal in part, and reducing the amount of the judgment at trial to $606,873.80. The judgment of the Superior Court rendered on June 25, 1965, had condemned the appellant to pay respondents $820,332.10 with interest and costs. The respondents cross-appealed and asked that the trial judgment be restored.\nFor convenience, I shall refer to the appellant as The Travelers, to the respondents as Pitts-Foley, and to the mise-en-cause as Stormont.\nThe facts are fully reviewed in the judgments below. Shortly stated they are as follows: On September 8, 1958, Pitts-Foley entered into a contract with Quebec Cartier Mining Company, to build a railroad from Shelter Bay on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River to a mining property located at Lac Jeannine. Pitts-Foley in turn entered into a number of subcontracts, including one with Stormont dated October 21, 1958, for the clearing and grubbing of the right of way. It was a condition of this contract that Stormont would provide a performance bond and this bond was issued by The Travelers on September 16, 1958, in an amount of $896,723.\nStormont began operations in September 1958, prior to the signing of the subcontract, and continued the work until February 27, 1959, when it suspended operations, alleging that it was unable to continue because of severe snow conditions. After negotiations with Pitts\u2011Foley, Stormont resumed work on April 17 and continued, after a fashion, until early in July 1959, when it abandoned all work alleging breach of contract by Pitts-Foley.\nIn August 1960, Stormont sued Pitts-Foley for $657,142.24 as damages for breach of contract and alternatively claimed $494,000 as the value of the work done. In September 1960, Pitts\u2011Foley countered with an action against Stormont for $1,212,648.77 as damages for breach of contract. At the same time, Pitts-Foley instituted the present action against The Travelers as Stormont\u2019s surety claiming $896,723, the full amount of the performance bond. After issues were joined, Pitts-Foley moved to join all three actions for trial at the same time. The two actions between Pitts-Foley and Stormont were ordered to be joined for trial, but for some reason which I cannot understand the application was refused with respect to the action against The Travelers. The Stormont and Pitts-Foley actions were tried before Mr. Justice Andr\u00e9 Demers who, after a long trial, rendered two judgments on July 28, 1964, maintaining Pitts-Foley\u2019s action and dismissing Stormont\u2019s action. The amount of the damages assessed against Stormont, $843,122.48, was not an assessment by the trial judge, but resulted from a consent entered into by the parties before judgment. The Travelers, which was intervenant in Stormont\u2019s action against Pitts-Foley, did not sign this consent and it is a common ground that it is not bound by it.\nAppeals were entered by Stormont from these two judgments and are still pending, awaiting the result of the appeal in this action.\nAfter judgment in the Stormont actions, Pitts-Foley moved to bring the present case on for trial, which took place before Mr. Justice Robinson, during a period extending from January to May, 1965; the parties agreed that all the depositions taken and all the exhibits filed in the Stormont cases would serve as evidence in this case with the right reserved to each party to call additional evidence. Both parties called additional evidence and filed additional exhibits.\nJudgment was rendered on June 25, 1965, condemning The Travelers to pay $820,332.10, the amount claimed by Pitts-Foley in its action, together with interest from the institution of the action, and costs. From this judgment, The Travelers appealed to the Court of Appeal and, as I have said, judgment was rendered on July 26, 1968, allowing the appeal to the extent of $213,458.30, and reducing the judgment of the Superior Court to $606,873.80.\nThe learned trial judge and all the judges in the Court below were unanimous in finding (1) that Stormont was in default to perform its obligations under its subcontract with Pitts\u2011Foley and (2) was liable for the damages sustained by the latter\u2014a view shared by Demers J. in the Stormont cases. The learned trial judge and all the judges in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench also held that The Travelers was liable under its Performance Bond. There was ample evidence to support those findings and I would not disturb them. There remains therefore only the question as to the quantum of damages.\nOn the question of quantum, the principal issues raised by The Travelers before the Court of Appeal and before this Court were (1) Pitts-Foley\u2019s claim for overhead, calculated at 30.62 per cent of direct costs, which The Travelers contended was excessive (2) an additional credit for clearing on the basis that such credit should be calculated at the rate of $202.70 per acre, and not $157.60 per acre as provided in the subcontract, and (3) an additional credit for grubbing done outside areas designated by the owner. The additional credit claimed under this last head was $225,684.\nAs I have stated, the Court below was unanimous as to The Travelers\u2019 liability. The majority (Tremblay C.J. and Montgomery J.) held that The Travelers was entitled to an additional credit for clearing, of $213,458.30, and reduced the damages awarded at trial by that amount. Montgomery J., dissenting in part, would have allowed a further credit by disallowing in part Pitts-Foley\u2019s claim for overhead. Rivard J., dissenting, would have confirmed the trial judgment and dismissed the appeal.\nFrom this summary, it will be seen that there are concurrent findings that Stormont was not entitled to the additional credit for grubbing. This question is fully discussed in the reasons of Rivard J., which on this point were concurred in by Tremblay C.J. and Montgomery J. I am in agreement with those reasons and there is nothing I could usefully add.\nAs to the basis upon which overhead was calculated, there was evidence upon which the trial judge and the majority in the Court of Appeal could make the finding which they did. I agree with that finding.\nAs I have stated, Pitts-Foley cross-appealed from the majority decision in the court below which reduced the damages awarded at trial from $820,332.70 to $606,873.80. That finding was based upon the interpretation and effect of an agreement dated April 13, 1959, under the terms of which, subject to certain conditions, the unit price to be paid to Stormont for clearing the right of way might be increased from $157.60 per acre to $202.70.\nStormont in breach of its subcontract had abandoned work at the end of February 1959 giving as its reason severe weather conditions. It seems clear, however, that the real purpose of the suspension was to force price concessions from Pitts-Foley. Be that as it may, the latter made every effort to get Stormont back on the job and a series of proposals and counter-proposals culminated in an agreement evidenced by a letter dated April 13, 1959.\nThat letter reads:\nStormont General Contractors Limited,\n2345 Viau Street,\nMontreal, P.Q.\nAttention: Mr. J.G. Joncas,\nPresident.\nGentlemen:\nThis will confirm the arrangements made between us concerning the clearing to be done by you in connection with the construction of the railway facilities from Shelter Bay, Quebec to Lac Jeannine under the contract between ourselves dated October 21, 1958. Subject to compliance by you with all the conditions stipulated in this letter and in the event of your actual cost for such clearing exceeding the contract price at the specified rate of $157.60 per acre, we shall, in lieu of such contract price, pay you your actual cost for such clearing not exceeding $202.70 per acre as determined and certified by our auditors.\nFuture payments for clearing shall be made as follows:\nI. We shall make progress payments under Article IV of the contract on the basis of the unit price of $157.60 per acre;\nII. When all acres to be cleared under the contract have been felled and stacked we shall within 30 days of acceptance of such acres by the owners pay such additional sum as may be required to adjust the unit per acre to your actual cost for clearing, to the extent above provided, as determined and certified by our auditors, less all amounts withheld by the Owners to cover burning not completed;\nIII. When all burning has been completed and accepted by the Owners we shall pay any balance then due to you for burning.\nThe conditions stipulated are that:\n(a) You shall recommence on or before the 20th day of April, 1959, continue without interruption and complete all your work under the contract in accordance with work schedules to be submitted by you and approved by us as conforming with the requirements of provision 16 of Appendix \u201cA\u201d to the contract;\n(b) You shall supply evidence acceptable to us on or before the 20th day of April 1959 that the principal amount of the Performance Bond with The Travelers Insurance Company, provided by you under the contract, covers complete performance of the work and payment therefor as provided above;\n(c) You shall give our auditors access to your books and records at any time during business hours for the purpose of determining your actual costs of clearing.\nAlso subject to your compliance with the above conditions, we undertake to deduct from the total clearing to be performed by you under the contract the total of the acres cleared by us for you during the suspension of your operations since March 2, 1959. We shall assume the entire cost of such clearing done by us and retain all payments received by us from the Owners in respect thereof.\nThis letter, when accepted by you, will constitute a binding agreement between us and except as expressly modified hereby our contract of October 21, 1958 shall remain in full force and effect.\nIf this letter is acceptable to you, kindly sign the enclosed copy and return it to us.\nVery truly yours,\nPITTS-FOLEY\nmc:\nL.G.

Gerard Joncas The Travelers Indemnity Company hereby consents to the modification outlined in this letter.\nOscar H. Gaudet\nOSCAR H. GAUDET\nAttorney-in-fact\nThe obligations undertaken by Pitts-Foley in that letter, in my opinion, were conditional obligations within the meaning of art. 1079 of the Civil Code and never took effect. Rivard J. stated the position accurately and concisely when he said:\n[TRANSLATION] Work started again on April 13, 1959, but was abandoned for good on July 6, 1959. Grubbing was resumed only on May 23 and was obviously stopped also on July 6. The conditions laid down by Pitts-Foley in the April 13 agreement were not complied with by Stormont, and Pitts-Foley cannot be considered in default by paying to Stormont only the prices stipulated in the original contract.\nIt follows that the subcontract between Stormont and Pitts-Foley was not amended and, in establishing its claim for damages, Pitts-Foley was not obliged to pay or to credit Stormont with any unit price for clearing other than that provided for in the subcontract dated October 21, 1958.\nFor the foregoing reasons and for those of Rivard J., with which I am in agreement, I would dismiss the appeal and allow the cross-appeal in both cases with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs; cross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Foster, Watt, Leggat, Colby, Rioux & Malcolm, Montreal.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, respondents: Lafleur & Brown, Montreal.\n[1] [1968] Que.

Day Appellant;\nand\nThe Minister of National Revenue Respondent.\n1969: May 30, June 3; 1969: October 7.\nPresent: Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nTaxation\u2014Income tax\u2014Dividend stripping\u2014Appropriation of corporation\u2019s undistributed income on hand to shareholders\u2014Winding up, discontinuance or reorganization of business\u2014Dividend deemed to have been received by shareholders\u2014Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, ss. 38(1), 81(1), 137(2).\nIn 1961, the appellants owned almost all the shares of an active company having substantial assets and an undistributed income of $728,652 on hand. A new company was incorporated in Ontario in which the appellants held shares in the same proportion as their respective holdings in the old company. Ail the assets of the old company were sold to the new company in exchange for a promissory note for $2,611,769. The new company obtained a bank loan to pay the old company which used the cash thus received to purchase preferred shares in two Vancouver based companies. The appellants sold their shares in the old company to the two Vancouver companies for cash at dollar for dollar on capital and 95 per cent on undistributed income. The appellants then reinvested part of that cash in debentures of the new company. When all the transactions had been completed, the undistributed income of the old company was in the hands of the appellants partly in cash and partly in debentures of the new company, without any income tax having been paid on such distribution. The Minister reassessed the appellants under s. 81(1) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148. The Exchequer Court confirmed the assessment but based its judgment on the application of ss. 137(2) and 8(1) of the Act. The taxpayers appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe case is plainly covered by s. 81(1) of the Act. There was a winding up and a discontinuance of the business of the old company, although there was no formal liquidation under the Winding up Act or the winding up provisions of the Ontario Companies Act. It was unnecessary to express any opinion on the scope of s. 137(2) of the Act.\nAPPEALS from a judgment of Gibson J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], in an income tax matter. Appeals dismissed.\nJohn J. Robinette, Q.C., and J.G. Edison, Q.C., for the appellant Conn Stafford Smythe.\nH.H. Stikeman, Q.C., and Bruce Verch\u00e8re, for the appellants Conn Smythe and Clarence H. Day.\nW.B. Williston, Q.C., G.W. Ainslie, Q.C., and A.D. Givens, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.\u2014These income tax appeals are the result of re-assessments made by the Minister against the appellants for the 1961 taxation year. Their appeals to the Exchequer Court1 have been dismissed. In my opinion, these further appeals should also be dismissed.\nThe re-assessments were made on the ground that the appellants had received and failed to report as income for the year 1961 undistributed income of a company\u2014C. Smythe Limited\u2014in which they were shareholders. Their shareholdings in that company were in these proportions:\nConn Smythe.........................................................\n52%\nConn Stafford Smythe..........................................\n30.8%\nClarence H. Day....................................................\n16%\nA. M. Boyd.............................................................\n1.2% The Minister took no proceedings against A.M. Boyd.\nIn the year 1961 C. Smythe Limited was an active company with substantial assets and \u201cundistributed income on hand\u201d amounting to $728,652. When transactions which I next propose to outline had been completed this undistributed income was in the hands of the shareholders of C. Smythe Limited in the form of $275,336 in cash and $453,316 in the form of non-interest bearing debentures of a newly incorporated company, C. Smythe for Sand Limited. From this point on I will refer to the two companies as the \u201cold company\u201d and the \u201cnew company\u201d. The application for incorporation of the new company is dated December 13, 1961. The letters patent are dated December 15, 1961, although they were not issued and recorded by the Provincial Secretary until January 4, 1962. This makes no legal difference to the transactions in question.\n1. On December 15, 1961, the directors of the old company authorized the sale by the old company of all its assets to the new company.\n2. On December 15, 1961, the directors of the new company met and:\n(a) authorized the allotment of 10,000 common shares of the company to the shareholders of the old company in the same proportion as their respective holdings in that company;\n(b) authorized the creation of non-interest bearing debentures not exceeding $2,750,000 to mature 15 December 1981; and\n(c) approved the purchase of all the assets of the old company.\n3. On December 20th, F.H. Cameron Ltd. and Dabne Enterprises (two Vancouver based companies) agreed to purchase all the issued shares of the old company for cash at dollar for dollar on capital and 95 per cent on undistributed income.\n4. On December 22nd, it was agreed that the closing of this transaction would be in Vancouver on December 28th. 5. On December 27th, final figures for closing were agreed upon, namely:\nTotal assets of the old company (including undistributed income of $728,652).............\n$2,611,769\nDiscount of 5 per cent of undistributed income...........................................................\n$36,433\nAdd further fee to F.H. Cameron Ltd. and Dabne Enterprises Ltd.................................\n5,000\n41,433\nPurchase price of shares.............................\n$2,570,336\n6. On December 27th, arrangements were made with the Toronto-Dominion Bank in Toronto whereby the bank made a loan of $316,769 repayable on January 2, 1962, to the new company. This loan was secured by a fixed deposit of $800,000, title to which had been transferred by the old company to the new company.\n7. On December 28th, arrangements were made with the Toronto-Dominion Bank in Toronto for a draft in the amount of $2,611,769 to be drawn on the Toronto-Dominion Bank in Vancouver at debit to the new company and made payable to the old company.\n8. On December 28th, the Bank of Montreal in Vancouver opened an account in the name of the old company authorizing F.H. Cameron and Bone (one of his associates) as signing agents. The Bank also lent $1,285,000 to F.H. Cameron Ltd. and $1,280,000 to Dabne Enterprises and obtained promissory notes for these amounts, which were credited to the respective accounts of the two companies. Immediately two drafts were drawn upon these accounts for $1,285,168 (F.H. Cameron Ltd.) and $1,285,168 (Dabne) and made payable to the Toronto-Dominion Bank, Vancouver.\n9. On December 28th, during the middle hours of the day, simultaneous meetings were held at the head office of the Toronto-Dominion Bank, Toronto, and the main branch of the Toronto-Dominion Bank in Vancouver. The outcome of the meetings was that all the shareholders of the old company resigned as officers and directors of that company and its seal, records and share capital were handed over to Cameron and his associates. There was an exchange of bank drafts; the Toronto-Dominion draft of $2,611,769 was. credited to the old company\u2019s account in the Bank of Montreal, Vancouver, while the Bank of Montreal drafts in the amount of $2,570,336 were transferred to the Toronto-Dominion Bank, Vancouver. In Toronto, the latter bank credited $2,295,000 to the account of the new company and paid out the following amounts:\nConn Smythe.............................................\n$143,175\nC. Stafford Smythe...................................\n84,763\nC.H. Day....................................................\n44,054\nA.M. Boyd..................................................\n3,344\n$275,336\nAnd finally, a balance sheet of the new company drawn before these transactions but giving effect to them showed a bank overdraft of $316,769, paid-up capital of $10,000 and non\u2011interest bearing debentures (which were held by the shareholders) in the amount of $2,285,000, totalling in all $2,611,769.\n10. On January 2, 1962, two cheques, each for a sum of $1,305,600, were drawn against the account of the old company at the Bank of Montreal, Vancouver, by Cameron and his associate Bone. These were deposited in the accounts of F.H. Cameron Ltd. and Dabne Enterprises Ltd. and simultaneously, these accounts were debited to repay the loans made by the bank.\n11. On January 2nd (at 4.30) the directors of the old company authorized that company to invest $2,611,200 in preference shares of F.H. Cameron Ltd. and Dabne Enterprises, which it did.\nIn summary, the result of these transactions is as follows:\nParty\u2014Partie\nBefore\u2014Avant\nAppellants\nC. Smythe\nC.S. Smythe\nC.H.

Dabne Entreprises Ltd,\nN\u00e9ant\nThere is only one possible conclusion from an examination of these artificial transactions and that must be that their purpose was to distribute or appropriate to the shareholders the \u201cundistributed income on hand\u201d of the old company. No oral or other documentary evidence is needed to supplement this examination. There was, however, an abundance of other evidence. This was a well-considered scheme adopted on the advice of professional advisers after other means of extraction of the undistributed income\u2014including payment of a tax under the provisions of s. 105(b) of the Act\u2014had been weighed and rejected.\nIn my opinion, s. 81(1) of the Act clearly applies and imposes the taxation demanded by the notices of re-assessment. Section 81(1) reads:\n81. (1) Where funds or property of a corporation have, at a time when the corporation had undistributed income on hand, been distributed or otherwise appropriated in any manner whatsoever to or for the benefit of one or more of its shareholders on the winding-up, discontinuance or re- organization of its business, a dividend shall be deemed to have been received at that time by each shareholder equal to the lesser of\n(a) the amount or value of the funds or property so distributed or appropriated to him, or\n(b) his portion of the undistributed income then on hand.\nIt is unnecessary to appeal to any other sections of the Act. This section covers specifically the case before us.\nGibson J. in the Exchequer Court defined the main issue for decision in the following terms:\nThe main issue for decision is whether or not these transactions resulted in the conferral of a benefit on the appellants within the meaning of subsection (2) of section 137 of the Income Tax Act; and in the event that the decision on the main issue is in the affirmative, a subsidiary issue for decision is whether the amount of such benefit should be assessed under section 8(1) or section 81(1) of the Income Tax Act.\nWith respect, it is unnecessary and undesirable that the issue should be defined in these terms. I think the case is plainly covered by s. 81(1) of the Act and that it is unnecessary to express any opinion on the scope of s. 137(2) of the Act.\nThere appears to be no doubt that the reassessments were made under s. 81(1) of the Act on the basis that there had been a winding-up, discontinuance or reorganization of the old company. Gibson J. was in doubt on this point although he expressed the opinion that had he been the assessor, he would have come to the conclusion that there was no winding-up, discontinuance or reorganization of the business of the old company within the meaning of s. 81(1).\nWith this opinion I do not agree and I would base my judgment on this section and this section alone. These assessments should be made under this section with the necessary consequences of a tax credit under s. 38(1). This, I understand, is what the assessor did.\nThe Exchequer Court leaves the result untouched but bases its judgment on the application of s. 137(2) and s. 8(1). If these were applied there would be no dividend tax credit. There is an inconsistency here in the judgment of the Exchequer Court. I would hold that there was a winding-up and a discontinuance of the business of the old company, although it is apparent that there was no formal liquidation under the Winding-up Act or the winding-up provisions of the Ontario Companies Act.\nI am content to adopt the judgment of Maclean J. in Merritt v. Minister of National Revenue[2]:\nI entertain no difficulty over the construction to be given the words \u201cwinding-up, discontinuance or reorganization,\u201d as used in s. 19(1) of the Act. In construing those words we must look at the substance and form of what was done here. In the case In Re South African Supply and Cold Storage Company (1904) 2 Ch.D., 268, Buckley J. had to consider whether or not there had been a winding-up \u201cfor the purpose of reconstruction or amalgamation,\u201d and he said \u201cthat neither the word reconstruction nor the word amalgamation has any definite legal meaning. Each is a commercial and not a legal term, and, even as a commercial term has no exact definite meaning.\u201d I think that would be equally true of the words of s. 19(1) which I have just mentioned. There was no \u201cwinding-up\u201d of the Security Company by a liquidator, but there was in fact, I think, a winding-up of the business of that company and I think the word \u201cwinding-up\u201d may be given that meaning here, although I need not definitely so decide because, in any event, there was a \u201cdiscontinuance\u201d of the business of the Security Company, and whether that was brought about by a sale to or amalgamation with the Premier Company is, in my opinion, immaterial. I therefore think there is no room for any dispute of substance but that the Security Company discontinued its business in a real and commercial sense, and that for a consideration it disposed of all its property and assets, however far that may carry one in deciding the issues in this case. There is, therefore, no necessity for attempting any precise definition of the words \u201cwinding-up, discontinuance or reorganization.\u201d What was done with the business of the Security Company fell somewhere within the meaning and spirit of those words. Neither do I entertain any doubt that there was a distribution of the property of the Security Company among its shareholders, in the sense contemplated by s. 19(1) of the Act, under the terms of the Agreement after its ratification by the shareholders of the Security Company. It is immaterial, in my opinion, that the consideration received by the appellant for her shares happened to reach her directly from the Premier Company and not through the medium of the Security Company.\nThis judgment was appealed to this Court[3] and is reported in (1942) S.C.R. 269. This Court affirmed the conclusion of Maclean J. that there had been a winding-up, discontinuance or reorganization. The partial reversal of Maclean J. was based solely on a different interpretation of the scope of the application of the then s. 19(1)\u2014namely, what taxation years it applied to. Section 19(1) was the predecessor of the present s. 81(1) and for the purpose of these reasons, there is no difference between the two.\nWhen this series of transactions was completed, the old company had preference shares of the two dividend-stripping companies\u2014F.H. Cameron Ltd. and Dabne Enterprises Ltd.\u2014in Vancouver, and no other assets. The assets behind the preference shares of these two companies were shares of companies which had been through the same mill as the old company in this case.\nThe plain facts are that at the end of all this activity\n(a) the shareholders of the old company were shareholders in the new company in the same proportions as they held shares in the old company. They had subscribed for these shares and their position as such shareholders is not questionable.\n(b) But when the old company transferred its assets to the new company, the total consideration should have been received by the old company.\n(c) That consideration was $2,611,769. If the new company wished to secure the purchase price by debentures, these should have been issued and delivered to the old company. Instead, we find cash and debentures in the hands of the shareholders of the old company. There are appropriate ways of making such a distribution but these ways would involve the payment of tax. Particularly, there was no sale of the shares of the old company to the dividend-stripping companies. The shares were transferred to these companies, with a fee of $41,433, for the purpose of enabling them to perform certain shuffles with the cheques and bank drafts to produce the result stated in these reasons. Taxation cannot be avoided by the transactions that were put through in this case. The orderly series of moves made on the closing in Vancouver does not assist the appellants.\nI would dismiss these appeals with costs and affirm the re-assessments made under s. 81(1).\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant, Conn Stafford Smythe: Edison, Aird & Berlis, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the appellants, Conn Smythe and Clarence H.

She had been there since about 2 p.m. About 9 p.m. a noisy altercation developed between them. The defendant B, who was the bar manager employed by the company, testified that on several occasions he asked them to keep quiet. He said that when their language \u201creally got rough\u201d he walked from behind the bar, put his hand on the plaintiff\u2019s shoulder and ordered him to get out. The plaintiff had no memory as to what occurred following the argument with his companion, but evidence given on his behalf was to the effect that B violently and without cause struck the plaintiff with the result that the plaintiff fell striking his head heavily on the tile floor. The evidence by B and supported by evidence of other customers was that he merely touched the plaintiff\u2019s shoulder and arms and drew him to his feet and then left him standing while he turned to pick up the plaintiff\u2019s jacket and the plaintiff, due to his intoxicated condition, fell to the floor and struck his head.\nAn action for assault against B and his employer was tried before a jury. The following question was answered by the jury in the negative: Did the defendant Balaban, without lawful excuse, commit an assault and battery on the plaintiff Mann? On the basis of this answer, the action was dismissed. On appeal, the Court of Appeal, by unanimous decision, dismissed the appeal. An appeal to this Court was taken solely on objection to the charge of the trial judge to the jury, the objection being that the trial judge misdirected the jury in saying that the onus of proof was on the plaintiff with respect to the issues of justification, lawful excuse and the use of reasonable force.\nHeld: (Martland and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and a new trial granted.\nPer Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ.: In an action for assault, it has been established that it is for the plaintiff to prove that he was assaulted and that he sustained an injury thereby. Then it is upon the defendant to establish the defences, firstly, that the assault was justified and, secondly, that the assault even if justified was not made with unreasonable force.\nThe trial judge did not put the case to the jury in accordance with these principles. In such a case as the present, where the evidence was wildly contradictory, the jury should be carefully instructed on which of the two parties bore the burden of proving a particular fact or establishing the particular issue.\nThe misdirection might well have affected the verdict and caused a miscarriage of justice. Therefore, despite the fact that no objection was made by counsel for the plaintiff at the close of the charge, the appeal should be allowed and a new trial granted.\nPer Martland and Judson JJ., dissenting: The charge to the jury, in the light of the pleadings, the evidence adduced, and the agreement of the parties as to the issue to be put to the jury, was a proper one. In the circumstances, the jury was not called upon to determine whether a particular degree of force was or was not excessive. If the jury believed the story told by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, the force used was obviously excessive. If they believed the defendant\u2019s story, no assault had been committed at all. That was the position at the conclusion of the trial, and in the light of all the evidence the question of onus was no longer of any significance.\nFurthermore, even if the charge could be said to be inadequate in relation to the matter of onus of proof, there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occasioned to the plaintiff which would permit the ordering of a new trial within the requirement of s. 28(1) of The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 197.\n[Cook v. Lewis, [1951] S.C.R. 830; Miska v. Sivec, [1959] O.R. 144; O\u2019Tierney v. Concord Tavern Ltd., [1960] O.W.N. 533; Ristow v. Wetstein, [1934] S.C.R. 128; Leslie v.

The incidents which gave rise to it occurred in the Ladies\u2019 Beverage Room in the Company\u2019s hotel, in Galt, Ontario, during the evening of December 23, 1965, when the defendant sought to have the plaintiff leave the premises.\nThe action was tried before a jury, which, in answer to the following question, gave the following answer:\nQuestion 1: Did the defendant Balaban, without lawful excuse, commit an assault and battery on the plaintiff Mann?\nAnswer: No.\nOn the basis of this answer, the action was dismissed, no order being made as to costs. An appeal to the Court of Appeal of Ontario, by unanimous decision, was dismissed, with costs. There were no written reasons. The present appeal is from that judgment. There was a sharp conflict in the evidence presented at the trial, in respect of some of the incidents which had occurred. The plaintiff arrived at the hotel at about 6 p.m. and was seated at a table, with Evelyn Killoran, with whom he was living as man and wife. She had been there since about 2 p.m. About 9 p.m. a noisy altercation developed between them.\nThe defendant, who was the bar manager employed by the Company, on several occasions asked them to keep quiet. The defendant said that when their language \u201creally got rough\u201d he walked from behind the bar, put his hand on the plaintiff\u2019s shoulder and ordered him to get out.\nThe evidence as to what then occurred is conflicting. The plaintiff had no memory as to what occurred, but Mrs. Killoran said that, without having said anything, the defendant hit the plaintiff on the side of the head, picked him up and threw him hard on the floor. Two other witnesses said that the defendant had thrown the plaintiff to the floor.\nThe defendant said that, after being told to leave, the plaintiff started to get up. He was not steady on his feet, and the defendant grabbed him to prevent his falling. When the plaintiff got to the aisle, near the table where he had been sitting, the defendant released his hold, and the plaintiff fell to the floor. This version of the incident was supported by several other witnesses.\nThe plaintiff struck his head on the floor and sustained serious injuries.\nFollowing the evidence, the learned trial judge charged the jury. No objection, save as to one minor matter, not relevant to this appeal, was made by counsel for the plaintiff. The questions put to the jury were framed with the agreement of counsel for all parties.\nCounsel for the appellant, in this appeal, contends that there was misdirection, or non-direction, in the charge to the jury, as to the onus of proof, occasioning a miscarriage of justice to the appellant. The objection to the charge relates chiefly to the following passages in it:\nNow, in this action the plaintiff, Mr. Mann, says he was unlawfully assaulted by the defendant, Mr. Balaban, and that he sustained damages by reason of the injuries he suffered because of this assault. If the plaintiff is to succeed, he must prove it and he must prove it on the reasonable balance of probabilities. In other words, for the plaintiff to succeed you members of the jury must be satisfied that he was probably assaulted without lawful excuse by the defendant, Mr. Balaban, and that, as a result of this, he probably sustained damages and, if this has been done, you will then assess a sum which will reasonably compensate Mr. Mann for such damages.\nNow, in addition to this, if the plaintiff is to succeed against the defendant hotel company, you must be satisfied not only that Mr. Balaban probably assaulted the plaintiff without lawful excuse, but that he did so in the course of his employment with the defendant hotel company. As I have said, in so far as this trial is concerned, an assault without lawful excuse may be defined as the intentional application of unlawful force by the defendant to the person of the plaintiff.\n* * *\nNow, for the plaintiff, of course, the case is that Mr. Balaban used excessive force under the circumstances; that the force he used was unreasonable and was entirely out of proportion to what the occasion required. That is what the plaintiff submits. It is for you to say whether that is true or not. You see, for the plaintiff, Mr. Mann, it is said, \u201cWell, let us say he was arguing in the beverage room. Let us say he was using foul language. Let us say he was creating some disturbance that nevertheless, assuming all this to be the case, there should have been some way for Mr. Balaban to remove him from the premises without fracturing his skull.\u201d\n* * *\nNow, there is the case pretty well, you see. For the plaintiff the case is that there was an excess of force used that Mr. Balaban came around and that he picked the plaintiff, Mr. Mann, from the chair and threw him on the floor. That is one part of the case.\n* * *\nWell, there is the one story of Mr. Balaban with force that was unreasonable and unwarranted so it is submitted by the plaintiff picking the plaintiff up out of the chair and by the excess of force causing him to find himself on the floor of the beverage room with a fractured skull.\nAnd the other picture that is presented by the defence is that the defendant, Balaban, in keeping order in the beverage room, as he was entitled to do, assisted, and was assisting, the plaintiff to get from the chair in which he was sitting out so that he could be removed from the beverage room and that he wasn\u2019t using any more force than was reasonable or necessary to accomplish that purpose. And that he had previously asked the plaintiff to leave, but the plaintiff had not left.\nImmediately following the passage just cited, the learned trial judge went on to say as follows:\nNow, it is for you to say what you believe in connection with this. You have heard all the witnesses as to just what occurred.\nNow, this is what I would like to say to you, and this is the law, with respect to this matter of expelling a person from premises. If you wished someone to leave your premises ordinarily no force at all is justified until he has been requested to leave and has been given a reasonable opportunity to leave. If it becomes necessary to use force to make someone leave your premises then it is lawful to use only such force as may be necessary to accomplish that purpose. It is not lawful to use more force than is necessary to accomplish that purpose. Where greater force than necessary or reasonable has been used to expel an intruder that constitutes an unlawful assault. That is an assault without lawful excuse and the intruder is entitled to compensation for the excess of force so used.\nIt is argued that the learned trial judge should have directed the jury that, if the plaintiff proved an assault, the onus shifted to the defendants to prove that such assault was justified or made with lawful excuse and that the force used was reasonable. Reliance was placed upon the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in O\u2019Tierney v. Concord Tavern Ltd.[1], in which it was held that the trial judge had misdirected the jury when he said, when instructing them in an action for assault, arising out of the plaintiff\u2019s ejection from a tavern, that the burden of proof was on the plaintiff to show that the defendant used excessive force.\nThe report of the case states:\nThe Court was unanimous in the opinion that on that ground the appeal must succeed. It had been laid down in Miska v. Sivec, [1959] O.R. 144, that in an action of this nature where the defendant set up a plea of justification for the force used, the burden of proving that the force used was not excessive in the circumstances rested upon the defendant.\nThe defendant, in the present case, did not set up any plea of justification. The plaintiff, in his statement of claim, pleaded as follows:\n4. The Defendant Walter Balaban was employed with the Royal Hotel as a waiter and unlawfully committed a grievous bodily assault upon the Plaintiff, causing severe, painful and personal injuries and causing personal injuries to the Plaintiff.\nThe defendant, by his statement of defence, denied this.\nCounsel for the plaintiff, in his opening remarks to the jury, outlined what he proposed to prove, as follows:\nNow, I propose to call evidence which will show that Warren Mann was a patron and a customer at the Royal Hotel and he was sitting in the ladies\u2019 beverage room and he was sitting with his lady friend who he lives with in a common law relationship. They had lived so for a year or so. It was their custom to imbibe at the Royal Hotel in Galt and did on this date which was December 23rd, 1965.\nNow, I propose to call evidence which will indicate that they were having an argument regarding a proposed trip by Warren Mann to Toronto and getting money for the trip from Mrs. Mann. And while this was going on, I will call evidence to indicate that Mr. Walter Balaban, the bar manager, who was standing behind the bar, came out from behind the bar and struck and threw Mr. Warren Mann to the floor.\nIt is clear that counsel for the plaintiff did not contest the right of the defendant to eject the plaintiff, under the circumstances, because, in the course of his charge, the learned trial judge said this:\nYou see, for the plaintiff, Mr. Mann, it is said, \u201cWell, let us say he was arguing in the beverage room. Let us say he was using foul language. Let us say he was creating some disturbance that nevertheless, assuming all this to be the case, there should have been some way for Mr. Balaban to remove him from the premises without fracturing his skull.\u201d\nThe issue before the jury was stated in the question, which had been agreed upon by counsel:\nDid the defendant Balaban, without lawful excuse, commit an assault and battery on the plaintiff Mann?\nIt is in the light of these circumstances that the charge to the jury must be considered and it must be considered as a whole, and in relation to the evidence which had been adduced. The plaintiff\u2019s case, upon the evidence of his witnesses, was that he had suffered serious injuries as a result of having been hurled to the floor by the defendant. The defendant\u2019s case was that there had been no assault causing injury to the plaintiff. If the laying of his hand by the defendant on the plaintiff\u2019s shoulder could be regarded as a technical assault it was abundantly clear that that act could not and did not cause any injury to the plaintiff. According to the defendant\u2019s evidence, supported by witnesses, apart from this act, all that the defendant did was to steady the plaintiff, when he rose to his feet, to prevent his falling.\nThe essential issue was, therefore, clear. Did the jury accept the plaintiff\u2019s contention that he had been thrown to the floor, or the defendant\u2019s contention that the plaintiff had not been thrown to the floor.\nIn the circumstances of this case the jury was not called upon to determine whether a particular degree of force was or was not excessive. If the jury believed the story told by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, the force used was obviously excessive. If they believed the defendant\u2019s story, no assault had been committed at all. That was the position at the conclusion of the trial, and in the light of all the evidence the question of onus was no longer of any significance. That issue was clearly stated by the learned trial judge in the passage from his reasons, already quoted, when he said:\nWell, there is the one story of Mr. Balaban with force that was unreasonable and unwarranted so it is submitted by the plaintiff picking the plaintiff up out of the chair and by the excess of force causing him to find himself on the floor of the beverage room with a fractured skull.\nAnd the other picture that is presented by the defence is that the defendant, Balaban, in keeping order in the beverage room, as he was entitled to do, assisted, and was assisting, the plaintiff to get from the chair in which he was sitting out so that he could be removed from the beverage room and that he wasn\u2019t using any more force than was reasonable or necessary to accomplish that purpose. And that he had previously asked the plaintiff to leave, but the plaintiff had not left.\nNow, it is for you to say what you believe in connection with this. You have heard all the witnesses as to just what occurred.\nIn my opinion the charge to the jury in this case, in the light of the pleadings, the evidence adduced, and the agreement of the parties as to the issue to be put to the jury, was a proper one. Furthermore, even if the charge can be said to be inadequate in relation to the matter of onus of proof, in the circumstances of this case I can find no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occasioned to the plaintiff which would permit the ordering of a new trial within the requirement of s. 28(1) of The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 197, which provides:\n28.\u2014(1) A new trial shall not be granted on the ground of misdirection or of the improper admission or rejection of evidence, or because the verdict of the jury was not taken upon a question that the judge at the trial was not asked to leave to the jury, or by reason of any omission or irregularity in the course of the trial, unless some substantial wrong or miscarriage has been thereby occasioned.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pro- nounced on March 4, 1968. By that judgment, the Court of Appeal dismissed, without written reasons, an appeal from the judgment of King J. pronounced on February 2, 1967. That judgment was rendered on the verdict of a jury and was one in which the plaintiff\u2019s action was dismissed.\nThe action was for damages which the plaintiff sustained in the premises of the defendant Fersu Hotel Limited on December 23, 1965. In the statement of claim, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant Walter Balaban, being an employee of the Royal Hotel as a waiter, unlawfully committed a grievous bodily assault on the plaintiff causing severe injuries. The defendant Balaban denied that he unlawfully committed an assault on the plaintiff and alleged that he was acting in the course of his employment and on the instructions of his employer. The defendant Fersu Hotel Limited also pleaded that the defendant Balaban had not committed an unlawful assault and further that if he had done so he was not acting in the course of his employment.\nCounsel for the respondent in this Court relied on the issue set up in those pleadings and submitted that the jury\u2019s answer had been simply a factual one that no assault had occurred. However, when one refers to the evidence at trial, it is clear that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was that he had been assaulted and assaulted unlawfully, and the defendant put in issue that the assault was merely a technical assault, that was fully justified and that no unnecessary force had been used. The defendant also sought to prove that the plaintiff had not been injured by any such technical assault as he had sustained his injuries when he fell on the floor of the beverage room and that such fall was caused by his own intoxicated condition rather than by any action of the defendant Balaban.\nThe first question which the learned trial judge put to the jury was this:\nDid the defendant Balaban, without lawful excuse, commit an assault and battery on the plaintiff Mann?\nThe jury\u2019s answer to that question was \u201cNo\u201d. Other questions were put to the jury but the jury did not find it necessary, in view of the above answer, to deal with any of the other questions.\nThe appeal to this Court is taken solely on objection to the charge of the learned trial judge to the jury. The objection is that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury in saying that the onus of proof was on the appellant, that is, the plaintiff, with respect to the issues of justification, lawful excuse and the use of reasonable force. Before I deal in some detail with that charge, a short recital of some facts should be given.\nThere was a great mass of contradictory testimony but certain circumstances are established. in the evidence without any contradiction. The plaintiff, the appellant here, arrived at the Fersu Hotel Limited premises, known as the Royal Hotel, in the City of Galt, at about 6:00 p.m. on the afternoon of December 23, 1965. There is no evidence that the plaintiff, prior to that time, had on that day consumed any liquor. The plaintiff swore that he had not done so. Following the events with which this action is concerned, at a time firmly established by the evidence of Constable Landry as being between 11:20 and 11:30 p.m., he saw the plaintiff sitting or lying against the front wall of the Royal Hotel with a waiter leaning over him who was either attempting to assist the plaintiff to his feet or lowering the plaintiff to the sidewalk. Therefore, the plaintiff had been inside that beverage room and of course there for the purpose of consuming beer from 6:00 p.m. until a moment or two before 11:20 p.m. The plaintiff has testified that he had 7 or 8 drinks of draft beer during that period and little is needed to infer that at the time of the occurrence giving rise to this action he was intoxicated to a very considerable extent. The action, however, is simply one for assault and is not based on any allegation that the defendant Balaban or his co-defendant the hotel company permitted the plaintiff to become intoxicated and incapacitated. The plaintiff himself, due to the effect of his injuries and particularly to a concussion which he received when his head struck the floor, has no memory whatsoever of anything following an argument between him and his companion Mrs. Killoran with whom he was living as man and wife at the time. Therefore, the evidence as to what occurred is given by various patrons of the beverage room and by the defendant Balaban and other waiters. As one might expect, under those circumstances, the evidence given on behalf of the plaintiff would appear to be to the effect that the defendant Balaban violently and without cause struck the plaintiff with the result that the plaintiff fell striking his head heavily on the tile floor. The evidence by the defendant Balaban and supported by evidence of other customers was that he merely touched the plaintiff\u2019s shoulder and arms and drew him to his feet and then left him standing while he turned to pick up the plaintiff\u2019s jacket and the plaintiff, due to his intoxicated condition, fell to the floor and struck his head. After the latter event, however it had been caused, another waiter simply took the plaintiff, put him over his shoulder, carried him out to the street and set him down against the wall. It was this latter action which was observed by Constable Landry at between 11:20 and 11:30 p.m.\nIn the light of these circumstances, I turn to the consideration of the charge by the learned trial judge. Having outlined the essential law as to what is an assault, the learned trial judge said:\nNow, in this action the plaintiff, Mr. Mann, says he was unlawfully assaulted by the defendant, Mr. Balaban, and that he sustained damages by reason of the injuries he suffered because of this assault. If the plaintiff is to succeed, he must prove it and he must prove it on the reasonable balance of probabilities. In other words, for the plaintiff to succeed you members of the jury must be satisfied that he was probably assaulted without lawful excuse by the defendant, Mr. Balaban, and that, as a result of this, he probably sustained damages and, if this has been done, you will then assess a sum which will reasonably compensate Mr. Mann for such damages. Now, in addition to this, if the plaintiff is to succeed against the defendant hotel company, you must be satisfied not only that Mr. Balaban probably assaulted the plaintiff without lawful excuse, but that he did so in the course of his employment with the defendant hotel company. As I have said in so far as this trial is concerned, an assault without lawful excuse may be defined as the intentional application of unlawful force by the defendant to the person of the plaintiff.\nAfter discussing some of the evidence, the learned trial judge continued:\nNow, for the plaintiff, of course, the case is that Mr. Balaban used excessive force under the circumstances; that the force he used was unreasonable and was entirely out of proportion to what the occasion required. That is what the plaintiff submits. It is for you to say whether that is true or not. You see, for the plaintiff, Mr. Mann, it is said, \u201cWell, let us say he was arguing in the beverage room. Let us say he was using foul language. Let us say he was creating some disturbance that nevertheless assuming all this to be the case, there should have been some way for Mr. Balaban to remove him from the premises without fracturing his skull.\nAnd having dealt with some of the evidence further, both that given on behalf of the plaintiff and that given on behalf of the defendants, the learned trial judge continued:\nAnd the other picture that is presented by the defence is that the defendant, Balaban, in keeping order in the beverage room, as he was entitled to do, assisted, and was assisting, the plaintiff to get from the chair in which he was sitting out so that he could be removed from the beverage room and that he wasn\u2019t using any more force than was reasonable or necessary to accomplish that purpose. And that he had previously asked the plaintiff to leave, but the plaintiff had not left.\nNow, it is for you to say what you believe in connection with this. You have heard all the witnesses as to just what occurred.\nHe then outlined the law, saying, in part:\nNow, this is what I would like to say to you, and this is the law, with respect to this matter of expelling a person from premises. If you wished someone to leave your premises ordinarily no force at all is justified until he has been requested to leave and has been given a reasonable opportunity to leave. If it becomes necessary to use force to make someone leave your premises then it is lawful to use only such force as may be necessary to accomplish that purpose. It is not lawful to use more force than is necessary to accomplish that purpose. Where greater force than necessary or reasonable has been used to expel an intruder that constitutes an unlawful assault. That is an assault without lawful excuse and the intruder is entitled to compensation for the excess of force so used.\nIn an action for assault, it has been, in my view, established that it is for the plaintiff to prove that he was assaulted and that he sutained an injury thereby. The onus is upon the plaintiff to establish those facts before the jury. Then it is upon the defendant to establish the defences, firstly, that the assault was justified and, secondly, that the assault even if justified was not made with any unreasonable force and on those issues the onus is on the defence.\nIn Cook v. Lewis[2], the present Chief Justice of this Court said at p. 839:\nWith the greatest respect, I think that the learned trial judge did not charge the jury correctly in regard to the onus of proof of negligence. While it is true that the plaintiff expressly pleaded negligence on the part of the defendants he also pleaded that he was shot by them and in my opinion the action under the old form of pleading would properly have been one of trespass and not of case. In my view, the cases collected and discussed by Denman J. in Stanley v. Powell (1891), 1 Q.B.D. 86, establish the rule (which is subject to an exception in the case of highway accidents with which we are not concerned in the case at bar) that where a plaintiff is injured by force applied directly to him by the defendant his case is made by proving this fact and the onus falls upon the defendant to prove \u201cthat such trespass was utterly without his fault.\u201d In my opinion Stanley v. Powell rightly decides that the defendant in such an action is entitled to judgment if he satisfies the onus of establishing the absence of both intention and negligence on his part. In Miska v. Sivec[3], Morden J.A. at p. 148, in discussing the plea of self-defence in an assault charge, said:\nSelf-defence is an answer to a claim for assault but only when the force used was not unreasonable in the circumstances. The reasonableness of the force is an integral part of the defence and, in my opinion, must be established by a defendant pleading son assault demesne.\nIn an action based on circumstances much similar to the present one, O\u2019Tierney v. Concord Tavern Ltd.[4], at p. 533 Roach J.A. said:\nThe Court was unanimous in the opinion that on that ground the appeal must succeed. It had been laid down in Miska v. Sivec, [1959] O.R. 144, that in an action of this nature where the defendant set up a plea of justification for the force used, the burden of proving that the force used was not excessive in the circumstances rested upon the defendant.\nWith respect, I am of the view that the learned trial judge did not put the case to the jury in accordance with the principles which I have outlined. When the learned trial judge said:\nNow in this action the plaintiff, Mr. Mann, says he was unlawfully assaulted by the defendant, Mr. Balaban, and that he sustained damages by reason of the injuries he suffered because of this assault. If the plaintiff is to succeed, he must prove it and he must prove it on the reasonable balance of probabilities. In other words, for the plaintiff to succeed you members of the jury must be satisfied that he was probably assaulted without lawful excuse by the defendant, Mr. Balaban, and that, as a result of this, he probably sustained damages and, if this has been done, you will then assess a sum which will reasonably compensate Mr. Mann for such damages.\nthe learned trial judge was putting on the plaintiff the burden of proving that he was assaulted and that there was no lawful excuse for the assault. The defendants should have had put upon them the burden of proving that there was lawful excuse for the assault. Again, in the paragraph as to excessive force which I have cited above, the charge is cast on the basis that the plaintiff must prove that the force was \u201cunreasonable and entirely out of proportion to what the occasion required\u201d, while it should plainly have been put that the defendant had the onus of proving that the force used was reasonable and was in proportion to what the occasion required. In my view, it is not sufficient to say, as the learned trial judge did:\nNow it is for you to say what you believe in connection with this. You have heard all the witnesses as to just what occurred.\nwithout stressing to them the fact that the burden of proving the allegation shifted from plaintiff to defendant after the plaintiff had proved the assault and the damage which he alleged was caused by the assault. In such a case as the present, where the evidence was wildly contradictory, the jury should be carefully instructed on which of the two parties bore the burden of proving a particular fact or establishing the particular issue. So, the answer of the jury to the question which I have set out above cannot be considered an answer that the plaintiff failed to prove assault but rather that it may well be interpreted that the plaintiff failed to prove an assault without legal justification and might reflect the jury\u2019s erroneous assumption from the learned trial judge\u2019s charge to them that the plaintiff had the duty of proving that there was no legal justification.\nFor these reasons, I am in agreement with the submission of counsel for the appellant that the learned trial judge\u2019s charge was defective and defective in a most important particular.\nCounsel for the respondent has pointed out that at the close of the learned trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury, there was no objection made to the charge by the counsel for the plaintiff. In fact, counsel for the plaintiff said: \u201cI have no comments, My Lord. As far as I feel, you properly charged the jury and I see no objection to it.\u201d Therefore, the counsel for the respondents con- tended that, under these circumstances, the plaintiff cannot now successfully obtain an order for a new trial. This matter has been considered on many occasions both in this Court and elsewhere. In Ristow v. Wetstein[5], Smith J., said at pp. 132-3:\nThere was a complete failure to direct the attention of the jury to this evidence on which a finding of negligence on the part of the driver might have been properly based, and in addition there was an express direction that the jury might disregard the most vital part of it. This was misdirection involving a mistrial and a miscarriage of justice in the sense that the plaintiff\u2019s case was not properly submitted to the jury. A new trial was therefore properly ordered, notwithstanding the fact that no objection was taken to the charge.\nIn Leslie v. The Canadian Press[6], Kerwin C.J. was considering the trial judge\u2019s charge in a libel action and said at p. 874:\n\u2026 I am of opinion that the preferable rule and the one that should be adopted is that it is sufficient for the complaining party to show that a misdirection may have affected a verdict and not that it actually did so; and that, if an appellate Court is in doubt as to whether it did or not, it is then for the opposite party to show that the misdirection did not in fact affect the verdict.\nFor the reasons which I have already outlined, I am of the opinion that the misdirection might well have affected the verdict and caused a miscarriage of justice. Therefore, despite the fact that no objection was made by counsel for the plaintiff at the close of the charge, I would allow this appeal and grant a new trial. In view, however, of that lack of objection, I am of the opinion that the plaintiff should not be allowed any costs of the first trial. However, in the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the fourth ground of appeal is set out as follows:\n4. The jury were misdirected as to the law in respect to assault and also the law in respect to trespass and as to what is involved in law in the excessive use of force.\nTherefore, in my view, the appellant should have the costs incurred in the Court of Appeal and in this Court. The costs of the new trial should be in the discretion of the judge presiding thereat. I would dispose of the appeal in the above fashion.\nAppeal allowed with costs, MARTLAND and JUDSON JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Simmers, Edwards, Jenkins, Thompson & Jenkins, Galt.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent, Fersu Hotel Ltd.: Lochead, Sills, Osborne, Madorin & Bean, Kitchener.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent, Walter Balaban: Sims, Baver, Sims & Giffen, Kitchener.\n[1] [1960] O.W.N. 533.\n[2] [1951] S.C.R. 830.\n[3] [1959] O.R. 144.\n[4] [1960] O.W.N. 533.\n[5] [1934] S.C.R. 128.\n[6] [1956] S.C.R. 871.\n",

The treatment of the fractures of the jaw consisted of the insertion of Kirschner wires and these wires protruded from the left cheek. The plaintiff was discharged from hospital eight days after the accident, and the Kirschner wires remained in his cheek for about four weeks.\nAt trial, the jury awarded the plaintiff general damages of $15,000. The Court of Appeal allowed the defendant\u2019s appeal and directed a new trial limited to the quantum of damages only. The conclusion that there should be a new trial was based solely upon the fact that the trial judge had permitted the submission to the jury of two photographs of the plaintiff which were taken during the period immediately following his discharge from hospital. The Court of Appeal disagreed with the opinion of the trial judge that these photographs were not in- clined to inflame the jury. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the Court of Appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at trial restored.\nPer Judson, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ.: The photographs showed graphically, although not horribly, the condition of the plaintiff as the result of his injuries and treatment in the few weeks after the accident. The photographs were relevant and were therefore admissible and should have gone to the jury unless their prejudicial effect was so great that it would exceed their probative value. The decision as to the prejudicial effect was essentially one for the exercise of the personal discretion of the trial judge in the particular circumstances of each case.\nThere was no justification for any interference with the award.\nPer Ritchie J.: The oral descriptions given by the doctors as to the effect of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries on his appearance and the nature of the medical treatment to which he was subjected were clearly relevant and admissible. This being the case, there was no valid ground for excluding the photographs which had the effect of providing the jury with a graphic illustration of the plaintiff\u2019s condition during the course of his treatment as described by the doctors.\n[Noor Mohamed v.

Appeal allowed and judgment at trial restored.\nH.G. Chappell, Q.C., and A.L. McKenzie, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant. M. Lerner, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of Judson, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by\nSPENCE J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 pronounced on June 27, 1968, whereby that Court allowed the appeal from the judgment of Grant J. pronounced on November 21, 1967, after trial by jury at Walkerton, Ontario. By its judgment, the Court of Appeal for Ontario, directed a new trial limited to the quantum of damages only.\nAt trial, the jury had awarded the appellant general damages of $15,000.\nMcGillivray J.A., in giving judgment for the Court of Appeal, based his conclusion that there should be a new trial solely upon the fact that the learned trial judge had permitted the submission to the jury of two photographs of the appellant which were produced and marked as exhibits at the trial and which, of course, the jury took with them into the room when they considered their verdict.\nThe accident occurred on September 9, 1966, and the appellant sustained injuries to which reference will be made hereafter. He was removed from the scene of the accident to the hospital at Listowel and on the same day from there to the Victoria Hospital at London. On the same night, he was operated on and the fractures of the jaw and cheekbone as well as the various lacerations were treated surgically. The surgical treatment of the fractures of the jaw, of course, consisted of the insertion of Kirschner wires and these wires protruded from the left cheek. The appellant was discharged from the hospital on September 17, i.e., eight days after the accident, and the Kirschner wires remained in his cheek for about four weeks. During that period of four weeks, the two photographs of the appellant were taken. His counsel sought to produce these photographs as exhibits during the examination-inchief of Dr. R.W. Granger, the surgeon who had carried out the treatment. Counsel for the respondents objected and after a rather lengthy argument the Court ruled that the photographs might be produced in evidence. During the course of the argument by counsel, Grant J. remarked:\nHIS LORDSHIP: This type of pin is so common that I would wonder if most of the jury hadn\u2019t already seen this type of pin actually holding together the teeth in the face of someone. I understand it thoroughly without the pictures and would understand it thoroughly without the pictures. The face does not display in the photograph any indication of great pain or suffering at the time.\nMR. LERNER: I thought I might have something in my notes but I don\u2019t have.\nHIS LORDSHIP: My thought is it depends to a great extent upon the question of whether it is inclined to inflame the jury or not. X-rays are not admitted because of their technical nature and the grave chance that they will be misunderstood. That elementis not present here.\n* * *\nHIS LORDSHIP: I don\u2019t think these pictures are offensive in that they will inflame a jury. My thought is that they are more apt, because of the expression shown by the subject of the picture, that they indicate no pain or suffering at the moment. I would think, Mr. McKenzie, you might do better with oral evidence, but that is for you to decide. I am inclined to say I will not stop you from putting these pictures in. You may do so if you want. I do say if they were pictures of the pins only I would say no because they add practically nothing to what the doctor has said, but it is most difficult for the doctor to explain exactly the condition of the scar at that time and it is for that purpose, if you will fix the exact date these pictures were taken. I suppose you haven\u2019t the photographer here, have you? After the jury had retired to its room to consider its verdict, it returned to put the following question:\nMR. FOREMAN: My Lord, some of the jury have asked how far are we to go to the future of these. I was just taking the present condition of these men or are we to go into the future? Anything what happen might happen in the future or just stop at the present time?\nto which His Lordship replied:\nHIS LORDSHIP: If in your opinion the evidence indicates that either of these men will suffer any damage in the future as result of injuries they received you are entitled and should give consideration to that.\nAs I have said, the jury found general damages of $15,000. In his reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal for Ontario, McGillivray J.A. said:\nI am wholly in accord with the trial judge when he says that so far as pictures of the pins are concerned they add nothing to the detail and clear evidence of the medical witnesses, supplemented as it was by the evidence of the plaintiff himself. I am not in accord with his belief that most of the Bruce County jurymen who were trying the case had observed people, or indeed any person, with pins such as these, and having corks, in the ends protruding from the face. I am satisfied indeed that such a sight would be a shock to many people. I am also of the opinion that a layman with the pictures before him might reach an erroneous opinion regarding the degree of pain and suffering connected with the treatment shown and might overlook, as a consequence, what had been established by the evidence. I consider the pictures to be inflammatory so I turn to consider whether, notwithstanding that fact, their admission was justified to better explain the evidence or as a necessary addition to it.\nThe occasions are frequent upon which a judge trying a case with the assistance of a jury is called upon to determine whether or not a piece of evidence technically admissible may be so prejudicial to the opposite side that any probative value is overcome by the possible prejudice and that therefore he should exclude the production of the particular piece of evidence. In the case of photographs, this occurs more frequently in the trials of criminal offences and more usually in murder trials. The matter is always one which is difficult for the trial judge and in itself essentially a decision in which the trial judge must exercise his own carefully considered personal discretion.\nIn the present case, there is no doubt that these two photographs were relevant and were therefore admissible. They show graphically, although I am strongly of the opinion not horribly, the condition of the plaintiff as the result of his injuries and treatment in the few weeks after the accident. The surgeon, in his evidence, stated that he found it difficult to describe in words the appearance of the appellant. Reference was made during the course of the trial to their evidentiary value as showing the condition of the scar at that time, and it was the opinion of the learned trial judge that he understood thoroughly the treatment and the type of pin employed without the pictures. The difficulty, of course, was not whether the learned trial judge would understand the treatment and the type of pin but whether the members of the jury would, and if there were some photographic material which would illustrate that treatment without being overly prejudicial in its effect, then that material should be available to the jury. In the present case, the appellant was entitled to damages not only because of the pain and suffering and any disability continuing in the future but, at any rate, in part, because he went around for some considerable time with these visible wires, their ends covered by large corks, protruding from the left side of his face. He would have all the discomfort connected therewith, for instance, in attempting to sleep, any possible contact with his face even when shaving, and in many other ways. Moreover, as the learned trial judge pointed out, the photographs did show with accuracy the scars as they existed at that time. Those scars were as visible to other persons as they were to the camera and the visibility of those scars to such persons from the moment when they were received is an element of damage which the appellant was entitled to have the jury consider.\nTherefore, I believe that the photographs were admissible and should have gone to the jury unless their prejudicial effect was so great that it would exceed their probative value.\nAs I have quoted above, the learned trial judge was of the opinion that such Kirschner wires now were so common that most of the members of the jury would have already seen this type of pin in someone\u2019s face. He was of the opinion that they were not inclined to inflame the jury. McGillivray J.A. in his reasons for judgment, which I have quoted above in part, was not in accord with that belief and said he was satisfied that such a sight would shock many people. It is my respectful opinion that the decision as to what would and what would not shock members of a jury can best be determined by the trial judge who sits in the court room with them and who charges them and can appreciate their reactions. I would be slow to express an opinion contrary to that of the trial judge upon the subject.\nFew Canadian or Commonwealth cases consider the submission of such material in jury trials.\nThe respondent cited only two and my research has produced very few additional examples. The reason for such paucity of authority is, I think, plain. The decision must be essentially one for the exercise of the personal discretion of the trial judge in the particular circumstances of each case. This view is, in my opinion, confirmed by statements made in the authorities. In Noor Mohamed v. The King[2], Lord Du Parcq, at p. 192, in considering evidence of the accused\u2019s connection with other alleged offences, said:\nIt is right to add, however, that in all such cases the judge ought to consider whether the evidence which it is proposed to adduce is sufficiently substantial, having regard to the purpose to which it is professedly directed, to make it desirable in the interest of justice that it should be admitted. If, so far as that purpose is concerned, it can in the circumstances of the case have only trifling weight, the judge will be right to exclude it. To say this is not to confuse weight with admissibility. The distinction is plain, but cases must occur in which it would be unjust to admit evidence of a character gravely prejudicial to the accused even though there may be some tenuous ground for holding it technically admissible. The decision must then be left to the discretion and the sense of fairness of the judge.\n(The italicizing is my own.)\nIn Gray v. LaFleche[3], Williams C.J.K.B., said at p. 349, when considering whether the plaintiff\u2019s injured member should be exhibited to the jury when in a jury trial:\nWhen, in a jury trial, the plaintiff seeks to invoke the rule laid down in Sornberger v. C.P.R. (1897), 24 O.A.R. 263, different considerations must be applied. As Chancellor Boyd pointed out, it is purely within the discretion of the trial Judge whether or not he will permit the practice there approved.\nIn Rex v. O\u2019Donnell[4], a prosecution for murder which had occurred during a rape, objection was made before the Court of Appeal for Ontario to the production at trial of certain photographs of the body of the victim on the ground that that prejudiced the jury against the accused. Mulock C.J.O. dismissed all the objections in a short statement:\nThe photographs in question served the useful purpose of corroborating the evidence as to the treatment to which Ruth Taylor was subjected by her assailant. It was not believable that the sight of these photographs prejudiced the jury against the accused. This ground of appeal should be dismissed.\nMasten J. at p. 532 simply excluded any consideration of prejudice if the photographs were admissible.\nIn Regina v. Creemer and Cormier[5], McKinnon J.A. said at pp. 154-5:\nIn my opinion, Ground 1 of the notice of appeal is not tenable. Photographs properly verified on oath by a person able to speak to their accuracy are admissible: Regina v. Toison (1864), 4 F. & F. 103, 176 E.R. 488. In Canada photographs have been admitted in evidence which showed the charred remains of a murdered person as they appeared at the time of a post-mortem examination: Rex v. Arthur Bannister, 10 M.P.R. 391, 66 C.C.C. 38, [1936] 2 D.L.R. 795. And photographs of the body of a woman found murdered as it appeared on the scene of the murder have been held admissible as. against the person charged with the crime: Rex v. O\u2019Donnell, 65 C.C.C. 299, [1936] 2 D.L.R. 517.\nAll the cases dealing with the admissibility of photographs go to show that such admissibility depends on (1) their accuracy in truly representing the facts; (2) their fairness and absence of any intention to mislead; (3) their verification on oath by a person capable to do so. The photograph here questioned, and others, was taken by Constable Sulewski, R.C.M.P., who for the past four and one-half years has been engaged in photography, fingerprints and related fields. He testified that the coloured photograph in question is a true representation as he saw it. The defence does not contend that this photograph was inaccurate or that it was introduced with an intention to mislead, but that it was calculated to arouse a sympathetic reaction. For the reasons noted, I would dismiss Ground 1 of the appeal.\nA similar view was reached by Baxter C.J. in Rex v. Bannister[6], and again in R. v. O\u2019Leary[7]. Although as McKinnon J.A. pointed out in the Creemer case the photographs exhibited what might well be regarded as horrible, being admissible, the prejudicial effect was regarded as no bar to their admission. It might well be that those views are too inflexible and that they fail to reflect the balancing of the probative value as against the prejudicial effect.\nIn Green v. The King[8], Latham C.J. said at p. 172:\nIt is objected that certain photographs showing the bodies of the murdered women were inadmissible in evidence and should not have been shown to the jury and that certain evidence given by a witness, Mrs. Brannigan, and another witness, Mr. Hewat, also was inadmissible. I can see no reason for holding that any of this evidence was inadmissible. No principle of law was stated the application of which would result in the exclusion of the evidence in question.\nIn The King v. Cartman[9], Fair J. ruled upon an objection made at a trial as to the production of certain photographs. The learned trial judge said at p. 728:\nThe Crown says that each photograph is necessary in order that the Crown\u2019s case may be presented as clearly as possible. It states that the different photographs do not deal with the same aspect of the matter, in that they do not present the same physical facts, and that the facts will not be as fully explained to the jury as they should be unless all the photographs are put in.\nSo, on the assumption that the nature and number of the photographs might prejudice the minds of the jury, it seems that they cannot be excluded because they have considerable probative value.\nBut, in saying that, I am not saying that I think the presentation of the photographs would have a prejudicial effect on the jury\u2019s impartial judgment. The circumstances in which the body of this poor woman were found were gruesome, and the photographs record these shocking circumstances; but I think that the jury themselves would separate the purposes for which the photographs are put in evidence from any impression they may have on first seeing them. As the case proceeds, the photographs will be regarded by them in the ordinary and proper way as matters of evidence, to be considered in relation only to the matters which they prove.\nI think, therefore, that all the photographs are admissible, should be admitted, and none of them should be made the subject of a suggestion by the Court that the Crown should not tender them as evidence.\nAs I have said, McGillivray J.A. based his reasons for directing a new trial upon the submission of these two photographs to the jury. He did, however, say:\nWith all respect to the learned trial judge, I consider the photographs in question to have been without evidentiary value. Their admission did nothing to assist the jury in its deliberations but might readily have distorted in the minds of the jury the degree of the damages to be assessed particularly as these were the only photographs before them in the jury room. That this has occurred I believe to be evidenced in the sum awarded for general damages. Without underrating in any way the seriousness of the injuries suffered by the plaintiff when one considers the limited period of disability as well as the remarkable degree of recovery made the general damages awarded are, I am satisfied, substantially above those justified by the evidence.\nMcGillivray J.A., of course, realized that the opinion of the Court of Appeal that the damages awarded by the jury were \u201csubstantially above those justified by the evidence\u201d was not of itself enough to justify interfering with the jury\u2019s verdict. Even if the damages had been assessed by a judge without the assistance of a jury then, apart from error in principle, such damages could only have been altered by the appellate tribunal \u201cif the amount awarded is so inordinately low or so inordinately high that it must be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage\u201d: Nance v. British Columbia Railway Company[10], per Viscount Simon at p. 613. That statement has been quoted and adopted in a series of cases in this Court: Fagnan v. Ure et al.[11]; Widrig v. Strazer et al.[12]; Gorman v. Hertz Drive Yourself Stations of Ontario Ltd. et al.[13]\nMoreover, in the present case, the assessment was made by a jury. Viscount Simon in the Nance case, supra, continued:\nThe last named case further shows that when on a proper direction the quantum is ascertained by a jury, the disparity between the figure at which they have arrived and any figure at which they could properly have arrived must, to justify correction by a court of appeal, be even wider than when the figure has been assessed by a judge sitting alone. The figure must be wholly \u201cout of all proportion\u201d (per Lord Wright, Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, Ltd., [1942] A.C. 601, 616).\nMcGillivray J.A. described the appellant\u2019s injuries, their treatment, the appellant\u2019s condition at the time of the trial, and the prognosis, in these terms:\nThe plaintiff\u2019s injuries were sustained in a motor vehicle accident on September 9th, 1966. He suffered severe injuries to his face and head with less serious injuries to his right knee, right chest and left shoulder. In detail there was a large irregular laceration on the left side of his face, a laceration through the lining of his mouth, complex fractures extending from under the right eye through the bridge of the nose under the left eye to the left cheek bone, described as a floating maxilla, upper jaw displaced downward and outward with the entire face structure displaced and with the lower jaw fractured in three places with displacement.\nAt the time of the accident the plaintiff was in the process of having all but nine of his teeth removed. Due to remedial measures taken following the accident these remaining teeth have been affected and it is said will also need to be removed.\nThe plaintiff suffered a mild concussion at the accident. He was taken to the hospital at Listowel and then transferred to the Victoria Hospital in London. There can be little doubt that his pain was severe during this period. At London under a general anaesthetic his facial bones were replaced as nearly as possible in their anatomical location and were fixed in position with two \u2018Kirschner\u2019 pins which protruded from his face. Fine wires were also put through the gum around the bases of the upper and lower teeth and the upper and lower teeth were wired together. There were also numerous small particles of glass removed from his left cheek and stitches were put in the cheek. The stitches were removed seven days later.\nThe plaintiff made quite a rapid recovery in view of the serious character of his injuries. At the end of four days he was ambulatory and eight days after admission to the hospital he was permitted to return home. He was examined two weeks after discharge by Dr. Grainer [sic] and again at four weeks after discharge he was seen and the Kirschner pins were removed. He was seen again two weeks later, six weeks after the accident, at which time the wires around his teeth were removed. He never required or sought medical attention thereafter. He resumed work at nine weeks after the accident and has lost no time from work since then.\nAt the time of the trial, March 20th, 1967, the plaintiff\u2019s nine front teeth had yet to be removed. He had a scar some two inches in length extending from the corner of his mouth into the left cheek. It was said not to be a revolting feature and while quite visible up to 12 or 14 feet away was not readily discernible at 20 feet. Some other minor scars were not very noticeable. He had full movement of his face. He complained of some gagging in swallowing but his surgeon who examined him prior to trial could find no condition in the plaintiff\u2019s mouth to account for this. The plaintiff also had numbness in two small areas on his face. He stated that there was a continual ache in the neighbourhood of his left cheek bone which became acute in the wind or when the weather was cold. In short he had made a rapid and surprisingly complete recovery from the serious facial injuries which he had suffered. It was fairly obvious as well that he had not sought to prolong his recovery and return to work.\nIt is difficult to characterize the sum of $15,000 awarded by the jury for the injuries and disabilities outlined by the learned justice in appeal as being \u201cinordinately high\u201d let alone \u201cout of all proportion\u201d. I am of the opinion that there was no justification for any interference with the award based on the amount thereof. Indeed, even if I were of the opinion that the photographs had been improperly admitted I would have thought that the appellant here, the respondent in the Court of Appeal, would, in that Court, have had a most convincing argument for the application of s. 28(1) of The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 197, which provides:\nA new trial shall not be granted on the ground of misdirection or of the improper admission or rejection of evidence, or because the verdict of the jury was not taken upon a question that the judge at the trial was not asked to leave to the jury, or by reason of any omission or irregularity in the course of the trial. unless some substantial wrong or miscarriage has been thereby occasioned.\nand could well have submitted that the appeal in that Court should have been dismissed.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and restore the judgment of Grant J. The appellant is entitled to his costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal for Ontario. RITCHIE J.\u2014I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by my brother Spence and I agree with him that this appeal should be allowed, but as I have reached the same conclusion for slightly different reasons, I find it desirable to express my view of the matter separately.\nThis appeal is limited to the question of the amount of general damages which the jury should have awarded to the appellant for the injuries which he sustained and in my opinion on this issue, the oral descriptions given by the doctors as to the effect of the appellant\u2019s injuries on his appearance and the nature of the medical treatment to which he was subjected were clearly relevant and admissible. This being the case, I can see no valid ground for excluding the photographs here in question which had the effect of providing the jury with a graphic illustration of the appellant\u2019s condition during the course of his treatment as described by the doctors.\nMy brother Spence has made reference to the judgment of Williams C.J.K.B., in Gray v. La\u2011Fleche[14], and to the cases there cited. In that case Chief Justice Williams held that where a plaintiff in a malpractice suit is claiming damages for bodily injuries, he is not entitled to show to the jury injured parts of the body which are not normally exposed, provided however that in the discretion of the trial judge such parts of the body may be exhibited in order to have the nature and extent of the damage explained by medical witnesses. In my view there is a clear distinction between the display of such injured parts of the body for the sole purpose of having them seen by the jury and the introduction of photographs taken during the course of the medical treatment for the injuries sustained. The photographs in the present case serve to illustrate the nature of the treatment to which the appellant was subjected and in this sense they form a part of the narrative of his illness and recovery and are both relevant and admissible.\nThere are cases where photographs which are relevant may nevertheless be excluded from the evidence in the discretion of the trial judge on the ground that they are inflammatory, but no basis has been established in the present case for holding that the learned trial judge erred in failing to exclude the photographs on that ground.\nMy brother Spence has also referred to a number of criminal cases in which photographs were tendered depicting the condition of a victim after murder or bodily assault. In some of these cases the trial judge exercised his discretion to exclude the evidence on the ground that it was of trifling weight and was prejudicial to the accused. In criminal cases where the sole issue is the guilt or innocence of the accused, it is understandable that such photographs should be excluded unless they can be shown to contain some evidence directly connecting the accused with the commission of the crime with which he is charged; but no such question can arise in the present case where the sole issue depends upon the jury\u2019s assessment of the compensation to be awarded for injuries sustained by the appellant. The photographs depicting the condition of these injuries while the appellant was under medical treatment relate directly to this issue and are therefore admissible.\nI agree with my brother Spence that the award of $15,000 made by the learned trial judge in this case cannot be said to be inordinately high and I would accordingly allow this appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Shepherd, McKenzie, Plaxton, Little & Jenkins, London.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Lerner, Lerner, Bradley, Cherniak & Granger, London.\n[1] [1968] 2 O.R. 683, 70 D.L.R.

L\u2019appelant a obtenu la permission d\u2019en appeler \u00e0 cette Cour sur les deux questions de droit suivantes: (1) les directives concernant le caract\u00e8re de l\u2019explication de l\u2019appelant \u00e9taient-elles conformes \u00e0 la loi, et (2), le juge a-t-il err\u00e9 en droit en permettant \u00e0 la Couronne de rappeler l\u2019accus\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin alors que la preuve de la d\u00e9fense \u00e9tait close et que la Couronne avait commenc\u00e9 sa contre-preuve.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nOn doit rejeter le grief que le juge au proc\u00e8s, en parlant d\u2019explications raisonnablement vraies au lieu de parler d\u2019explications qui peuvent \u00eatre raisonnablement vraies, aurait plac\u00e9 l\u2019accus\u00e9 dans l\u2019obligation de prouver hors de tout doute raisonnable que son explication \u00e9tait raisonnablement vraie. Ce qui importe, c\u2019est que dans leur substance, sinon dans leur forme, les directives correspondent ad\u00e9quatement aux exigences de la loi. Dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le juge a expliqu\u00e9 ce qu\u2019il fallait entendre par une explication qui est raisonnablement vraie et a expos\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une explication qui, au regard des circonstances, peut avoir du bon sens, est vraisemblable ou qui engendre un doute; il a dit que, pour repousser la pr\u00e9somption r\u00e9sultant de la possession r\u00e9cente, l\u2019accus\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9 de convaincre le jury hors de tout doute que son explication \u00e9tait vraie, et, plusieurs fois, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 innocent et que dans tous les cas, la Couronne gardait toujours le fardeau absolu de prouver la culpabilit\u00e9 hors de tout doute raisonnable. L\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9 de reprocher au juge d\u2019avoir d\u00e9plac\u00e9 le fardeau de la preuve.\nQuant \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me question, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de la consid\u00e9rer parce que ce nouvel interrogatoire de l\u2019accus\u00e9 n\u2019a rien ajout\u00e9 qui puisse emp\u00eacher la Cour de conclure que le verdict aurait n\u00e9cessairement \u00e9t\u00e9 le m\u00eame si cet incident n\u2019avait pas eu lieu.\nCriminal law\u2014Possession of stolen bonds\u2014Explanation by accused\u2014Whether onus of proof displaced by trial judge\u2014Recall by the Crown of accused as a witness after the defence had closed its case and the Crown had started its rebuttal\u2014Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 296, 597(1)(b).\nThe appellant, a business man of Quebec City, was convicted of the possession of ten bonds which had been stolen in Montreal. The appellant said that he received the bonds the day after the theft and that he disposed of them the following day. His explanation consisted in admitting that he had helped, for a financial consideration, an unknown man from Montreal to defraud the taxing authorities and in denying knowledge that the bonds had been stolen. The conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the following questions of law: (1) whether the instructions to the jury concerning the appellant\u2019s explanation complied with the law, and (2), whether the trial judge erred in law in giving leave to the Crown to recall the accused as a witness after the defence had closed its case and the Crown had started its rebuttal.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe objection that the trial judge, when speaking of explanations reasonably true instead of explanations which may reasonably be true, had placed on the accused the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that his explanation was reasonably true, could not be entertained. What is important is that the instructions, in their substance if not in their form, should adequately meet the requirements of the law. In the present case, the judge explained what was to be understood by an explanation which is reasonably true and stated that it is an explanation which, having regard to the circumstances, makes sense, is plausible or raises a doubt; he said that the accused did not have, in order to rebut the presumption raised by the recent possession, to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that his explanation was true, and stated several times that the accused was presumed innocent and that at all events the Crown had at all times the absolute onus of proving the guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It could not be said that the trial judge had displaced the onus of proof.\nIt was not necessary to consider the second question because this new examination of the accused did not add anything which could prevent the Court from concluding that the verdict would have necessarily been the same if that incident had not taken place.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec[1], affirming the appellant\u2019s conviction for possession of stolen bonds.

Les directives donn\u00e9es au jury, en ce qui concerne le caract\u00e8re de l\u2019explication susceptible en droit de repousser la pr\u00e9somption r\u00e9sultat de la possession r\u00e9cente d\u2019objets vol\u00e9s, sont-elles conformes \u00e0 la loi?\n2. Le juge au proc\u00e8s a-t-il err\u00e9 en droit alors que, la d\u00e9fense ayant d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sa preuve close et la couronne ayant commenc\u00e9 sa contre-preuve, il a permis \u00e0 la couronne, nonobstant l\u2019objection de la d\u00e9fense, d\u2019appeler l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins et de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 le contre-interroger? Il convient d\u2019exposer bri\u00e8vement les faits. Les obligations mentionn\u00e9es dans l\u2019acte d\u2019accusation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vol\u00e9es, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, dans la nuit du 10 au 11 novembre 1964, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019une effraction commise \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence de M. et Mme Charles A. Davison. D\u00e8s le lendemain du vol, soit dans la matin\u00e9e du 12 novembre 1964, ces obligations sont, dans la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, en la possession de l\u2019appelant, homme d\u2019affaires y exer\u00e7ant diff\u00e9rents commerces. Les circonstances dans lesquelles l\u2019appelant raconte avoir re\u00e7u ces d\u00e9bentures le 12 novembre et en avoir dispos\u00e9 d\u00e8s le jour suivant, sont relat\u00e9es en d\u00e9tail aux raisons de jugement de M. le juge Choquette, auxquelles ses coll\u00e8gues ont donn\u00e9 leur accord. Il suffit de r\u00e9sumer. Au cours de la matin\u00e9e du 12 novembre, l\u2019un des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019appelant, R.C. Handy, pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 celui-ci, comme \u00e9tant un repr\u00e9sentant d\u2019une maison de courtage de Montr\u00e9al, un soi-disant courtier du nom de Jimmy Bundy. Cette pr\u00e9sentation faite, celui-ci expose qu\u2019un de ses clients, d\u00e9tenteur des obligations en question, a des probl\u00e8mes avec l\u2019imp\u00f4t et pour cette raison, est pr\u00eat \u00e0 vendre ces valeurs \u00e0 10 pour cent de moins que le prix parce que s\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9clar\u00e9, il perdrait 50 pour cent, soit plus de $4,000; et Bundy d\u2019ajouter que son client insiste pour que la vente soit faite imm\u00e9diatement, loin de Montr\u00e9al, au nom d\u2019une autre personne et dans des circonstances ne laissant aucune trace susceptible d\u2019alerter le minist\u00e8re du Revenu national. L\u2019appelant ne veut pas acheter directement parce que il n\u2019a pas le temps de s\u2019occuper de cette affaire mais songeant qu\u2019un nomm\u00e9 Michel Camirand, ancien vendeur d\u2019obligations, a tout le temps voulu, il s\u2019informe de ce dernier pour savoir si la proposition de Bundy l\u2019int\u00e9resse. Camirand lui conseille alors de ne pas acheter ces obligations avant que leur valeur et le fait qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019obligations vol\u00e9es, ne soient v\u00e9rifi\u00e9s. Il sugg\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de se les faire remettre par Bundy et de les lui transmettre ensuite aux fins de cette v\u00e9rification. Bundy consent \u00e0 remettre les titres \u00e0 l\u2019appelant en \u00e9change d\u2019un r\u00e9c\u00e9piss\u00e9. L\u2019appelant porte alors les obligations \u00e0 Camirand. D\u00e8s le lendemain, soit le 13 novembre, Camirand vend les obligations \u00e0 une maison de courtage, au nom d\u2019un client fictif, nomm\u00e9ment Marcel Larue, 333, rue Notre\u2011Dame, Thetford Mines, P.Q.\u2014Notons incidemment que Camirand a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait fait la v\u00e9rification pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, alors que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve, plusieurs jours sont requis pour v\u00e9rifier si des obligations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9es comme vol\u00e9es.\u2014La vente \u00e9tant faite, la maison de courtage \u00e9met un ch\u00e8que au montant de $8,714.19 au nom de la personne fictive; un employ\u00e9 endosse le ch\u00e8que, l\u2019encaisse \u00e0 la banque, en remet le produit \u00e0 Camirand qui le remet ensuite \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, moins une commission de 5 pour cent, soit environ $435, qu\u2019il garde pour lui-m\u00eame. L\u2019appelant, \u00e0 son tour, remet le solde \u00e0 Bundy, moins une commission de 5 pour cent. Ainsi donc et dans toute cette affaire, il ressort que le nom de l\u2019appelant, celui de Handy, celui de Bundy, celui du v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire des d\u00e9bentures n\u2019apparaissent aucunement dans la transaction; le re\u00e7u que l\u2019appelant dit avoir donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Bundy, lorsque celui-ci lui a remis les d\u00e9bentures, n\u2019est pas produit; Camirand ne donne aucun re\u00e7u \u00e0 l\u2019appelant lorsque ces d\u00e9bentures lui sont remises pour \u00eatre vendues ou pour la commission de $435 qu\u2019il a gard\u00e9e; Bundy ne donne aucun re\u00e7u \u00e0 l\u2019appelant pour les $7,842.78 que celui-ci lui a remis; l\u2019appelant ne donne aucun re\u00e7u \u00e0 Bundy pour sa commission ou celle de Camirand; et une commision totale de 10 pour cent, soit environ $871, est pay\u00e9e alors que la commission r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, suivant la preuve, est de 2\u00bd \u00e0 3 pour cent. Enfin, ni Bundy, ni Handy sont entendus comme t\u00e9moins et les seuls exhibits produits dans la cause consistent dans les obligations en question, trois \u00e9tats de compte \u00e9manant des courtiers o\u00f9 elles furent vendues et un certificat attestant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Charles A. Davison. En somme, d\u00e9clare M. le juge Choquette, avec l\u2019accord de ses coll\u00e8gues, l\u2019explication de l\u2019appelant consiste \u00e0 avouer qu\u2019il a aid\u00e9, moyennant finance, un inconnu de Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 frauder le fisc d\u2019une somme d\u2019au moins $4,000 et \u00e0 nier que Bundy lui ait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ou que lui-m\u00eame ait pens\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019obligations vol\u00e9es. Et M. le juge Choquette de conclure:\nSur le tout, les circonstances sont tellement suspectes que l\u2019on peut dire qu\u2019elles auraient convaincu tout homme raisonnable qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019obligations vol\u00e9es; que si l\u2019appelant ne l\u2019a pas r\u00e9alis\u00e9, c\u2019est qu\u2019il s\u2019est d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment refus\u00e9 \u00e0 le savoir, qu\u2019il a volontairement ferm\u00e9 les yeux \u00e0 une \u00e9vidence que tout homme ordinaire eut clairement per\u00e7ue. Il y a dans sa conduite plus que de l\u2019insouciance ou de la simple n\u00e9gligence; on y trouve tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments permettant au jury de conclure \u00e0 sa culpabilit\u00e9. Armstrong v. La Reine (1966) B.R. 695; Kenny\u2019s Outlines of Criminal Law, 18e \u00e9dition, 1962, n\u00b0 360, note 2, p. 357.\nIl va sans dire que les seules questions de droit que nous sommes appel\u00e9s \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer et d\u00e9terminer en cet appel sont celles sur lesquelles la permission d\u2019appeler fut accord\u00e9e. Le premier grief de l\u2019appelant est que, au cours de ses instructions aux jur\u00e9s, relativement au caract\u00e8re de l\u2019explication susceptible de repousser la pr\u00e9somption r\u00e9sultant du fait de la possession r\u00e9cente, le juge a parl\u00e9 d\u2019explications raisonnablement vraies au lieu de parler d\u2019explications qui peuvent \u00eatre raisonnablement vraies et il a de la sorte, dit-on,\u2014et c\u2019est l\u00e0 l\u2019essence m\u00eame du grief\u2014plac\u00e9 l\u2019accus\u00e9 dans l\u2019obligation de prouver hors de tout doute raisonnable que son explication \u00e9tait raisonnablement vraie. La Cour d\u2019appel a rejet\u00e9 ce grief et avec cette d\u00e9cision, nous sommes tous, pour les raisons ci-apr\u00e8s, respectueusement d\u2019accord.\nLa possession r\u00e9cente des obligations par l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait l\u2019un des faits qui, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des circonstances incriminantes concernant leur r\u00e9ception et leur disposition, devait, avec le reste de la preuve, \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration, comme \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve, dans l\u2019examen de la question de savoir si l\u2019appelant savait qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019obligations vol\u00e9es. La loi sur la possession r\u00e9cente est expos\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on compl\u00e8te, concise et fid\u00e8le dans la 10e \u00e9dition de Phipson on Evidence, \u00e0 la page 53, au n\u00b0 106:\nOn charges of stealing or receiving, proof of recent possession of the stolen property by the accused, if unexplained or not reasonably explained, or if, though reasonably explained, the explanation is disbelieved, raises a presumption of fact, though not of law, that he is the thief or receiver according to the circumstances; and upon such unexplained, or not reasonably explained, possession, or disbelieved explanation, the jury may (though not must) find him guilty. It is not, however, for the accused to prove honest dealing with the property, but for the prosecution to prove the reverse; and if an explanation be given which the jury think may be true, though they are not convinced that it is, they must acquit, for the main burden of proof (i.e. that of establishing guilt beyond reasonable doubt) rests throughout upon the prosecution, and in this case will not have been discharged.\nD\u2019o\u00f9 l\u2019on voit qu\u2019un des dangers contre lequel le juge doit se garer, en formulant ses directives de droit sur la question et particuli\u00e8rement sur le caract\u00e8re de l\u2019explication donn\u00e9e par l\u2019accus\u00e9, est que son adresse aux jur\u00e9s, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un tout, laisse ou puisse raisonnablement laisser aux jur\u00e9s l\u2019impression que d\u00e8s que la possession r\u00e9cente est \u00e9tablie, le fardeau de la preuve passe de la poursuite \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense et que c\u2019est alors \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 de satisfaire les jur\u00e9s qu\u2019il a une explication raisonnable \u00e0 offrir, que cette explication est vraie ou que ses agissements en ce qui concerne les objets vol\u00e9s \u00e9taient honn\u00eates. Le juge doit inviter les jur\u00e9s \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de toutes les circonstances de la cause, si l\u2019explication donn\u00e9e par l\u2019accus\u00e9 peut \u00eatre vraie et les directives qu\u2019il doit alors leur donner doivent traduire (i) l\u2019obligation qu\u2019ils ont d\u2019acquitter l\u2019accus\u00e9 s\u2019ils sont d\u2019avis que l\u2019explication donn\u00e9e peut \u00eatre vraie bien qu\u2019ils ne soient pas convaincus qu\u2019elle le soit et (ii) le droit, mais non l\u2019obligation, qu\u2019ils ont, en se fondant sur la pr\u00e9somption d\u00e9coulant de la possession r\u00e9cente, de trouver l\u2019accus\u00e9 coupable s\u2019ils ne croient pas ou trouvent d\u00e9raisonnable de croire en l\u2019explication donn\u00e9e. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, l\u2019appelant a raison de dire que le juge au proc\u00e8s a parl\u00e9 d\u2019explications raisonnablement vraies au lieu de parler, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de cette Cour dans Richler v. Le Roi[2] et dans Ungaro v. Le Roi[3], d\u2019explications qui peuvent \u00eatre raisonnablement vraies. Cependant, et ainsi qu\u2019on s\u2019en est exprim\u00e9 aux raisons de jugement en Cour d\u2019appel, ces mots n\u2019ont pas de valeur sacramentelle. En fait, ni cette Cour dans ces causes, ni la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Angleterre dans Rex. v. Schama[4], sur laquelle se fondent ces d\u00e9cisions, n\u2019ont alors pr\u00e9tendu innover en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la substance du droit et, \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, la Cour d\u2019appel dans Rex v. Schama, supra, s\u2019est servie tant\u00f4t de l\u2019expression which may reasonably be true et tant\u00f4t de l\u2019expression which might be true. Ce qui importe, c\u2019est que dans leur substance, sinon dans leur forme, les directives correspondent ad\u00e9quatement aux exigences de la loi. Dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance a expliqu\u00e9 aux jur\u00e9s ce qu\u2019il fallait entendre par une explication qui est raisonnablement vraie et leur a expos\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une explication qui, au regard des circonstances r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es par la preuve, peut avoir du bon sens, est vraisemblable ou qui engendre un doute; il leur a dit que, pour repousser la pr\u00e9somption r\u00e9sultant de la possession r\u00e9cente, l\u2019accus\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9 de les convaincre hors de tout doute que son explication \u00e9tait vraie et, plusieurs fois, il leur a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 innocent et que dans tous les cas, la Couronne gardait toujours le fardeau absolu de prouver sa culpabilit\u00e9 hors de tout doute raisonnable. Apr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 l\u2019adresse dans son entier, nous sommes tous d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9 de reprocher au juge d\u2019avoir d\u00e9plac\u00e9 le fardeau de la preuve. Le second grief de l\u2019appelant est n\u00e9 du fait qu\u2019apr\u00e8s que l\u2019accus\u00e9 eut \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu comme t\u00e9moin en d\u00e9fense, que la d\u00e9fense eut d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sa preuve close et que la Couronne eut commenc\u00e9 sa contre-preuve, la Couronne a demand\u00e9 et obtenu du juge, nonobstant l\u2019objection de la d\u00e9fense, la permission de rappeler l\u2019accus\u00e9 pour lui poser quelques questions additionnelles. En ce faisant, dit l\u2019appelant, le juge a commis une erreur de droit. La Cour d\u2019appel a rejet\u00e9 cette pr\u00e9tention en consid\u00e9rant que tant que l\u2019instruction n\u2019est pas termin\u00e9e, le juge a discr\u00e9tion pour permettre que de nouvelles questions soient pos\u00e9es \u00e0 un t\u00e9moin d\u00e9j\u00e0 entendu.

Quelques jours plus tard, les m\u00eames intim\u00e9es pr\u00e9sent\u00e8rent \u00e0 la Commission une requ\u00eate, bas\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 33 du Code du travail, S.R.Q. 1964, c. 141, pour faire suspendre les n\u00e9gociations de renouvellement de la convention collective. La Commission d\u00e9clara non recevable la requ\u00eate pour suspension des n\u00e9gociations pour le motif qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas juridiction pour l\u2019accorder. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure a alors rejet\u00e9 une demande pour obtenir l\u2019\u00e9mission d\u2019un bref de mandamus dirig\u00e9 contre la Commission pour la forcer d\u2019entendre les intim\u00e9es sur le m\u00e9rite de leur demande de suspension. Ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvers\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019appel qui a accord\u00e9 le bref de mandamus. La Commission en appela \u00e0 cette Cour, o\u00f9 la question en litige \u00e9tait de savoir si la Commission avait refus\u00e9 d\u2019exercer une comp\u00e9tence que l\u2019art. 33 du Code du travail lui conf\u00e8re.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel de la Commission doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLa Commission a err\u00e9 en droit en \u00e9tablissant une distinction que l\u2019art. 33 du Code du Travail n\u2019autorise pas, et a ainsi refus\u00e9 d\u2019exercer une comp\u00e9tence que la loi lui faisait un devoir d\u2019exercer. L\u2019art. 33 conf\u00e8re \u00e0 la Commission un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et, r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les tribunaux ne doivent pas intervenir dans l\u2019exercice d\u2019un tel pouvoir. Cependant si un tribunal comme la Commission erre en droit dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du texte qui lui conf\u00e8re comp\u00e9tence, les tribunaux ordinaires doivent intervenir et le mandamus est le recours appropri\u00e9 pour forcer un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 exercer une comp\u00e9tence que la loi lui conf\u00e8re.\nLabour\u2014Jurisdiction of Labour Relations Board of Quebec\u2014Collective agreement\u2014Petition by rival union for certification and for suspension of negotiations for renewal of agreement\u2014Mandamus to oblige Board to hear petitioners\u2014Labour Code, R.S.Q. 1964, c. 141, s. 33\u2014Collective Agreement Decrees Act, R.S.Q. 1964, c. 143\u2014Code of Civil Procedure, art. 844, 845.\nWhile a group of unions, affiliated to the Confederation of National Trade Unions, were negotiating the renewal of a collective agreement to which they were parties, the respondent unions, affiliated to the Canadian Labour Congress, presented to the Labour Relations Board 41 petitions in certification to represent the same employees. A few days later, the same respondents presented to the Board a petition, based on s. 33 of the Labour Code, R.S.Q. 1964, c. 141, to suspend the negotiations for renewal of the collective agreement. The Board refused to grant the suspension of the negotiations on the ground that it did not have jurisdiction to do so. The Superior Court rejected a petition for the issue of a writ of mandamus against the Board to force it to hear the respondents on the merits of their petition for suspension. That judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal which granted the writ of mandamus. The Board appealed to this Court, where the question in issue was whether the Board had refused to exercise a jurisdiction it had under s. 33 of the Labour Code.\nHeld: The appeal of the Board should be dismissed.\nThe Board had erred in law in making a distinction which s. 33 of the Labour Code did not authorize, and had thereby refused to exercise a jurisdiction it was bound by law to exercise. Section 33 gives to the Board a discretionary power and as a general rule, the Courts will not interfere in the exercise of such a power. However, if a tribunal such as the Board has erred in law in the interpretation of the text giving it jurisdiction, mandamus is the proper recourse to force an inferior tribunal to exercise its jurisdiction.

La Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec1, dans un jugement unanime rendu le 22 janvier 1968, a cass\u00e9 ce jugement et ordonn\u00e9 que la requ\u00eate soit retourn\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission pour que celle-ci la d\u00e9cide \u00e0 son m\u00e9rite. D\u2019o\u00f9 le pourvoi de la Commission devant cette Cour.\nIl n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, pour disposer de cet appel, de relater tous les faits \u00e0 l\u2019origine du conflit. Il suffit de rappeler qu\u2019un groupe de syndicats affili\u00e9s \u00e0 la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Syndicats nationaux \u00e9tait partie \u00e0 une convention collective \u00e0 laquelle le \u00abD\u00e9cret relatif \u00e0 l\u2019industrie et aux m\u00e9tiers de la construction pour la r\u00e9gion de Qu\u00e9bec\u00bb avait conf\u00e9r\u00e9 l\u2019extension juridique en vertu de la Loi de la convention collective, S.R.Q. 1941, c. 103, devenue, lors de la refonte de 1964, la Loi des d\u00e9crets de convention collective, S.R.Q. 1964, c. 143. Le 25 mai 1965, soit 60 jours avant la date pr\u00e9vue pour l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9cret, les intim\u00e9es, affili\u00e9es au Congr\u00e8s du Travail du Canada, d\u00e9pos\u00e8rent aupr\u00e8s de la Commission 41 requ\u00eates en accr\u00e9ditation, dans le but de repr\u00e9senter les m\u00eames salari\u00e9s. Quelques jours plus tard, soit le 12 juillet 1965, elles pr\u00e9sent\u00e8rent \u00e0 la Commission une requ\u00eate pour faire suspendre les n\u00e9gociations qui avaient alors cours entre les syndicats mis-en-cause et l\u2019Association des Constructeurs de Qu\u00e9bec en vue du renouvellement de leur convention collective.\nLe texte qui conf\u00e8re comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 la Commission pour accorder une telle requ\u00eate est l\u2019art. 33 du Code du Travail que l\u2019on retrouve d\u2019ailleurs dans la d\u00e9cision de la Commission ci-apr\u00e8s cit\u00e9e.\nLa seule question en litige est la suivante: La Commission a-t-elle refus\u00e9 d\u2019exercer une comp\u00e9tence que l\u2019art. 33 du Code du Travail lui conf\u00e8re? L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du texte de la d\u00e9cision en cause est d\u2019une importance capitale et c\u2019est pourquoi je la cite au long:\nL\u2019article 33 du Code du Travail dont on demande l\u2019application se lit comme suit:\n\u00abLorsqu\u2019elle est saisie d\u2019une requ\u00eate en accr\u00e9ditation, revision ou r\u00e9vocation d\u2019accr\u00e9ditation, la Commission peut ordonner la suspension des n\u00e9gociations et des d\u00e9lais de n\u00e9gociations collectives et emp\u00eacher le renouvellement d\u2019une convention collective.\nEn ce cas, les conditions de travail pr\u00e9vues dans telle convention demeurent en vigueur jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Commission et les dispositions de l\u2019article 48 s\u2019appliquent.\u00bb\nLes n\u00e9gociations vis\u00e9es par l\u2019article 33 sont celles qui se rapportent \u00e0 une convention collective susceptible d\u2019avoir effet sous l\u2019empire du Code du Travail, selon les dispositions du chapitre III du Code.\nIl semble \u00e9vident que la requ\u00eate telle que formul\u00e9e vise les n\u00e9gociations se rapportant \u00e0 un accord entre une collectivit\u00e9 d\u2019employeurs et une collectivit\u00e9 de groupements de salari\u00e9s, en vue de r\u00e9aliser sous l\u2019empire de la Loi de la Convention Collective (S.R.Q. 1941, chap. 163), une r\u00e9glementation par arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil, dans le cadre de ladite loi, des conditions de travail devant r\u00e9gir les salari\u00e9s d\u2019une occupation et d\u2019un territoire donn\u00e9s.\nUn tel accord vise l\u2019industrie en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et non pas tel ou tel employeur en particulier, D\u2019ailleurs, aucun employeur particulier vis\u00e9 par l\u2019une quelconque des requ\u00eates en accr\u00e9ditation all\u00e9gu\u00e9es n\u2019est mise en cause sur la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sentement soumise. La juridiction conf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission par l\u2019article 33 du Code du Travail ne peut avoir pour objet un accord de cette nature et de cette port\u00e9e.\nLes dispositions d\u2019un d\u00e9cret, sauf le cas exceptionnel de l\u2019article 10a de la Loi de la Convention Collective lequel par le fait m\u00eame confirme la r\u00e8gle, ne peuvent faire obstacle aux demandes d\u2019accr\u00e9ditation sous le Code du Travail par des groupements de salari\u00e9s m\u00eame r\u00e9gis par tel d\u00e9cret. Voir \u00e0 ce sujet la d\u00e9cision de la Commission des Relations Ouvri\u00e8res en date du 9 mars 1964 dans l\u2019affaire du Conseil des M\u00e9tiers du B\u00e2timent et de la Construction de Montr\u00e9al et Banlieue vs Canadian Vickers Limited.\nCorr\u00e9lativement, des demandes d\u2019accr\u00e9ditation ne peuvent pas faire \u00e9chec aux discussions d\u2019un accord du genre de celui poursuivi par les n\u00e9gociations all\u00e9gu\u00e9es.\nLa structure des relations patronales-ouvri\u00e8res vis\u00e9e par le Code du Travail et celle pr\u00e9vue par la Loi de la Convention Collective sont d\u2019un ordre diff\u00e9rent et ne peuvent \u00eatre confondues ou paralys\u00e9es dans leur fonctionnement l\u2019une par l\u2019autre.\nLa demande de suspension des n\u00e9gociations doit donc, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme non recevable.\nLa demande exprim\u00e9e par la deuxi\u00e8me conclusion de la requ\u00eate \u00e0 l\u2019effet d\u2019ordonner aux intim\u00e9es de \u00absuspendre toute n\u00e9gociation et de surseoir \u00e0 la signature de toute convention collective\u00bb d\u00e9passe la port\u00e9e des all\u00e9gations qui la pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent et n\u2019appara\u00eet pas support\u00e9e par celles-ci, dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se ou une telle conclusion viserait une convention collective particuli\u00e8re (et destin\u00e9e \u00e0 valoir comme telle) entre un employeur d\u00e9termin\u00e9 et le groupe de ses salari\u00e9s.\nQuant \u00e0 la conclusion \u00e0 l\u2019effet d\u2019ordonner de cesser de percevoir ou de retenir les prestations syndicales, elle ne peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e, la Commission n\u2019ayant pas en toute hypoth\u00e8se autorit\u00e9 pour modifier un contrat d\u00e9j\u00e0 pass\u00e9 si tel contrat existe.\nPOUR CES MOTIFS la Commission d\u00e9clare non recevable la requ\u00eate produite par les requ\u00e9rants le 12 juillet 1965.\n(Les italiques sont de moi.)\nIl me para\u00eet \u00e9vident, \u00e0 la lecture de cette d\u00e9cision, en particulier les passages que j\u2019ai soulign\u00e9s, que la Commission a d\u00e9clin\u00e9 une juridiction qu\u2019elle avait en refusant de se prononcer sur le m\u00e9rite de la demande de suspension.\nL\u2019article 33 conf\u00e8re \u00e0 la Commission un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et, r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les tribunaux ne doivent pas intervenir dans l\u2019exercice d\u2019un pouvoir comme celui-l\u00e0. Cependant, il est bien \u00e9tabli que, si un tribunal comme la Commission erre en droit dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du texte qui lui conf\u00e8re comp\u00e9tence, les tribunaux ordinaires doivent intervenir, et le mandamus est le recours appropri\u00e9 pour forcer un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 exercer une comp\u00e9tence que la loi lui conf\u00e8re. Ce recours est maintenant consign\u00e9 aux art. 844 et 845 du nouveau Code de proc\u00e9dure civile sous le titre \u00abMoyen de se pourvoir en cas de refus d\u2019accomplir un devoir qui n\u2019est pas de nature purement priv\u00e9e.\u00bb\nJe suis enti\u00e8rement d\u2019accord avec la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec que la Commission a err\u00e9 en droit, en \u00e9tablissant une distinction que l\u2019art. 33 du Code du Travail n\u2019autorise pas, et qu\u2019ainsi elle a refus\u00e9 d\u2019exercer une comp\u00e9tence que la loi lui faisait un devoir d\u2019exercer.

Le premier versement devait avoir lieu le 10 mai 1960. Au contrat, il \u00e9tait stipul\u00e9 qu\u2019un billet n\u00e9gociable avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 par l\u2019acheteur au vendeur.

Il est en preuve qu\u2019avant la premi\u00e8re \u00e9ch\u00e9ance, United Loan connaissait le d\u00e9faut de livraison. L\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante, cette compagnie devenait insolvable et le fiduciaire vendait \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, avec le concours de la Banque Imp\u00e9riale, le contrat de vente conditionnelle avec le billet qui n\u2019en avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tach\u00e9. Une carte comptable indiquant que seuls les deux premiers versements avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7us et portant la mention \u00abnon livr\u00e9\u00bb fut aussi remise \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Cette derni\u00e8re d\u00e9tacha le billet et intenta une poursuite fond\u00e9e exclusivement sur cet effet en pr\u00e9tendant avoir les droits d\u2019un d\u00e9tenteur r\u00e9gulier. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action pour le motif que le billet \u00e9tait nul faute de consid\u00e9ration. Ce jugement fut infirm\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire de la Cour d\u2019appel.

Weinberg, [1956] R.C.S. 553. La preuve non contredite d\u00e9montre que le vendeur devait livrer le manteau avant l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du premier versement. Si dans ces conditions il se servait, pour obtenir de l\u2019argent, d\u2019un document reconnaissant la livraison sans r\u00e9v\u00e9ler le fait de la non livraison, il commettait une fraude. Ce fait ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 \u00e0 United Loan, celle-ci connaissait le vice du titre et il fallait alors que l\u2019on prouve sa bonne foi, ce qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tent\u00e9.\nLa pr\u00e9tention que la banque n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9tentrice r\u00e9guli\u00e8re parce qu\u2019elle avait pris l\u2019effet en garantie collat\u00e9rale vient \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans Bonenfant c. La Banque Canadienne de Commerce, [1930] R.C.S. 386. La banque \u00e9tait d\u00e9tentrice r\u00e9guli\u00e8re au moins jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de la dette garantie collat\u00e9rallement. Il faut donc admettre que l\u2019intim\u00e9e doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme aux droits de la banque et comme cette derni\u00e8re a pris l\u2019effet avant l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance, il importe peu, si on le tient pour un billet au sens de la Loi sur les lettres de change, que la cession subs\u00e9quente \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e ait eu lieu alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en souffrance, l\u2019art. 57 ne faisant pas de distinction \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nDans le cas pr\u00e9sent, l\u2019effet n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un billet au sens de l\u2019art. 176(1) de la Loi sur les lettres de change. Ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9 c\u2019est le tout, le billet non d\u00e9tach\u00e9 du contrat. En examinant ce tout il est impossible d\u2019en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que la promesse de l\u2019acheteur \u00e9tait inconditionnelle. Le cas pr\u00e9sent diff\u00e8re de Killoran c. Monticello State Bank (1921), 61 R.C.S. 528.\nBills and notes\u2014Promissory note attached to a conditional sale contract\u2014Both assigned as a whole to a holder\u2014Action by assignee exclusively on the note\u2014Object of sale not delivered\u2014Is the assignee a holder in due course\u2014Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 15, ss. 57, 58(2), 176(1).\nOn April 7, 1960, the appellant purchased a fur coat and signed a conditional sale contract on a printed form of a finance company, United Loan Corporation, which stated that the seller would remain owner until payment of all the instalments. The first of these instalments was to be made on May 10, 1960. The contract stipulated that a negotiable promissory note had been given by the purchaser to the seller. This note was on the same sheet as the contract and was endorsed by the seller to United Loan. The coat was never delivered and the seller went bankrupt a few months later. On April 13, 1960, the contract, with the note still attached to it, was in the hands of United Loan which, on April 26, 1960, transferred it as collateral to the Imperial Bank. At the time of the signature of the contract, the appellant had also signed a series of cheques, each covering one instalment. These cheques were in the hands of United Loan which cashed only the first two, payment of the others having been stopped by the appellant. The evidence showed that before the due date of the first instalment, United Loan knew that the coat had not been delivered. The following year, United Loan went bankrupt and the trustee, with the bank\u2019s consent, sold to the respondent the appellant\u2019s contract to which the note was still attached. The respondent was also given an accounting card indicating that two payments had been made and a mention \u201cnot delivered\u201d. The respondent detached the note and sued exclusively on that instrument alleging that it had the rights of a holder in due course. The Superior Court dismissed the action on the ground that the note was null for lack of consideration. This judgment was reversed by a majority decision in the Court of Appeal. An appeal was launched to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nWhen there has been fraud at the origin of a negotiable instrument, the burden of proving good faith is on the holder: Benjamin v. Weinberg, [1956] S.C.R. 553. The uncontradicted evidence showed that the seller had to deliver the coat before the date of the first instalment. If, in order to obtain a loan, he was using a document acknowledging delivery without revealing the fact of the non delivery, he was committing a fraud. The fact of the non delivery having been revealed to United Loan, the latter knew the defect of the title and it was up to it to prove its good faith, which was not attempted to be done.\nThe contention that the bank was not a holder in due course because it had received the note as collateral goes against the judgment of this Court in Bonenfant v. The Canadian Bank of Commerce, [1930] S.C.R. 386. The bank was a holder in due course at least up to the amount of the debt guaranteed collaterally. It must therefore be admitted that the respondent must be considered in the rights of the bank and, as the latter had taken possession of the note before its maturity it matters not under s. 57 of the Bills of Exchange Act that its subsequent delivery to the respondent took place when it was overdue, so long as the instrument is considered a note within the meaning of the Act.\nHowever, the instrument was not a note according to s. 176(1) of the Bills of Exchange Act. What was delivered was the note attached to the contract, forming a whole. A scrutiny of the whole reveals that the promise made by the buyer was not unconditional. The present case differs from the judgment in Killoran v. Monticello State Bank (1921), 61 S.C.R. 528.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], reversing a judgment of Morin J.

Le prix total, taxe comprise, \u00e9tait de $792 payable en 24 versements de $33 chacun \u00e0 partir du 10 mai. En m\u00eame temps que la commande adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Durand Fourrures Inc., il a sign\u00e9 un \u00abContrat de vente conditionnelle\u00bb selon une formule imprim\u00e9e de United Loan Corporation, une \u00abcompagnie de finance\u00bb. Dans ce document, le vendeur est d\u00e9crit comme Durand & Coutu Enrg. La premi\u00e8re condition inscrite au verso se lit comme suit:\n1. Le vendeur restera propri\u00e9taire des choses pr\u00e9sentement vendues jusqu\u2019\u00e0 parfait paiement final du prix de la vente \u00e0 temp\u00e9rament: si l\u2019acheteur fait d\u00e9faut d\u2019en acquitter le prix conform\u00e9ment aux conditions arr\u00eat\u00e9es aux pr\u00e9sentes, le vendeur aura le droit, \u00e0 son choix, soit d\u2019exiger le paiement imm\u00e9diat des versements \u00e9chus, soit de reprendre possession dudit appareil sans indemnit\u00e9 ni sans \u00eatre tenu de rembourser l\u2019argent d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7u par le vendeur en acompte du prix de vente \u00e0 temp\u00e9rament, et dans ce cas, l\u2019acheteur se trouvera lib\u00e9r\u00e9 quant au solde du prix de la vente \u00e0 temp\u00e9rament.\nLe montant inscrit comme total des paiements diff\u00e9r\u00e9s est $792 payable au bureau de United Loan en 24 versements mensuels de $33 \u00e0 partir du 10 mai 1960, avec la stipulation suivante:\nUn billet promissoire n\u00e9gociable a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 par l\u2019Acheteur au Vendeur comme pi\u00e8ce constatant ledit Total des Paiements Diff\u00e9r\u00e9s mais non pas en paiement d\u2019icelui.\nEn fait, il n\u2019y a qu\u2019un seul document le \u00abbillet\u00bb est la partie inf\u00e9rieure de la feuille de papier dont la partie sup\u00e9rieure est intitul\u00e9e \u00abContrat de vente conditionnelle\u00bb. Entre les deux, il n\u2019y a qu\u2019une ligne pointill\u00e9e. Le \u00abbillet\u00bb porte \u00e0 gauche en travers, la mention \u00abInstrument n\u00e9gociable\u00bb, au verso, il s\u2019y trouve un endossement imprim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de United Loan Corporation. La signature du vendeur y figure \u00e0 l\u2019endroit appropri\u00e9. On constate \u00e9galement plus bas un endossement au nom de United Loan Corporation. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019au moment d\u2019instituer l\u2019action que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9tach\u00e9 le \u00abbillet\u00bb du contrat.\nLors de la signature de la commande et du contrat de vente conditionnelle, le vendeur avait verbalement promis de livrer le manteau de fourrure dans deux ou trois semaines. En fait, il ne l\u2019a jamais livr\u00e9 et il a fait faillite quelques mois plus tard. Cependant, d\u00e8s le 13 avril, le contrat de vente conditionnelle, billet compris, \u00e9tait entre les mains de United Loan \u00e0 son si\u00e8ge social \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Le 26 avril, celle-ci le remettait \u00e0 la Banque Imp\u00e9riale avec un grand nombre d\u2019autres effets semblables, en garantie collat\u00e9rale d\u2019avances d\u00e9passant le million de dollars.\nEn m\u00eame temps que la commande et le contrat de vente conditionnelle, l\u2019appelant avait sign\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie de ch\u00e8ques au montant de $33 chacun, faits \u00e0 Tordre de Durand & Coutu Enrg. et payables \u00e0 chacune des \u00e9ch\u00e9ances. Ces ch\u00e8ques, (ou plut\u00f4t ces traites: Leduc c. La Banque d\u2019Hochelaga)[2], avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 endoss\u00e9s et United Loan les avait en sa possession, ce qui lui permit d\u2019encaisser les deux premiers. Apr\u00e8s cela, l\u2019appelant les ayant contremand\u00e9s, le paiement fut refus\u00e9 et les menaces de poursuite n\u2019obtinrent aucun r\u00e9sultat. Il faut ajouter qu\u2019avant la premi\u00e8re \u00e9ch\u00e9ance, United Loan connaissait le d\u00e9faut de livraison; un de ses employ\u00e9s ayant, par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pouse de l\u2019appelant si son manteau lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9; elle avait r\u00e9pondu n\u00e9gativement.\nL\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante, United Loan devenait insolvable \u00e0 son tour et, le 19 octobre 1961, le fiduciaire de ses d\u00e9tenteurs de billets garantis vendait \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, avec le concours de la Banque, un certain nombre de cr\u00e9ances parmi lesquelles se trouvait la r\u00e9clamation contre l\u2019appelant. C\u2019est en ex\u00e9cution de cette convention que le contrat de vente conditionnelle, avec le \u00abbillet\u00bb qui n\u2019en avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tach\u00e9, fut remis \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. On lui remit \u00e9galement une carte comptable indiquant que seuls les deux premiers versements mensuels avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7us et portant la mention \u00abNon livr\u00e9\u00bb. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ayant d\u00e9tach\u00e9 le \u00abbillet\u00bb intenta une poursuite fond\u00e9e exclusivement sur cet effet, et elle pr\u00e9tend avoir les droits d\u2019un d\u00e9tenteur r\u00e9gulier.\nLa Cour sup\u00e9rieure a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le billet nul faute de consid\u00e9ration, consid\u00e9rant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas les droits d\u2019un d\u00e9tenteur r\u00e9gulier\u00bb\nEn appel[3], ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9 par le motif suivant auquel une majorit\u00e9 s\u2019est ralli\u00e9e:\nLa U.L.C. ayant remis le billet contre valeur et avant qu\u2019il ne f\u00fbt en souffrance, elle doit \u00eatre r\u00e9put\u00e9e avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tenteur r\u00e9gulier, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il ne soit prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait de mauvaise foi lorsqu\u2019elle a pris le billet, ou qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7u avis d\u2019un vice affectant le titre de Durand & Coutu Enrg.\nOr, cette preuve n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. Il est vrai que l\u2019\u00e9pouse du d\u00e9fendeur a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait averti la U.L.C. par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone que l\u2019objet de la vente ne lui avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9; mais cela se passait quelque dix jours apr\u00e8s la signature du billet et sa n\u00e9gociation \u00e0 la U.L.C. Il est vrai aussi que la U.L.C. savait que le billet avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 en paiement d\u2019un manteau vendu \u00e0 temp\u00e9rament, puisque le contrat de vente lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 c\u00e9d\u00e9. Mais ce contrat ne contenait rien qui p\u00fbt lui faire soup\u00e7onner que le manteau n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9; au contraire, l\u2019acheteur y reconnaissait avoir re\u00e7u l\u2019objet de la vente.\nAvec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, ce motif me para\u00eet erron\u00e9. On y consid\u00e8re que c\u2019est au d\u00e9fendeur qu\u2019il incombait de faire la preuve de la mauvaise foi de United Loan. Or, notre Cour, confirmant un arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec, a statu\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019il y a eu fraude \u00e0 l\u2019origine d\u2019un effet de commerce il incombe \u00e0 celui qui l\u2019a pris de prouver sa bonne foi (Benjamin c. Weinberg)[4]. Ici, la preuve non contredite d\u00e9montre que le vendeur devait livrer le manteau de fourrure avant l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du premier versement. Si dans ces conditions il se servait, pour obtenir de l\u2019argent, d\u2019un document reconnaissant la livraison sans r\u00e9v\u00e9ler le fait de la non livraison, il me semble \u00e9vident qu\u2019il commettait une fraude. D\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, s\u2019il r\u00e9v\u00e9lait le fait \u00e0 United Loan, il est clair que celle-ci connaissait le vice de titre. A mon avis, c\u2019est ce qu\u2019il faut d\u00e9duire de la seule preuve au dossier: l\u2019appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique destin\u00e9 \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier la livraison. Si l\u2019on voulait pr\u00e9tendre que United Loan \u00e9tait de bonne foi, il fallait que l\u2019on prouve cette bonne foi et cette preuve on n\u2019a pas tent\u00e9 de la faire.\nCela cependant est loin de disposer du litige car le \u00abbillet\u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9 \u00e0 la Banque avant l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du premier versement et une preuve compl\u00e8te a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite des circonstances de ce transport et de la bonne foi de la Banque. A l\u2019audition, le procureur de l\u2019appelant a admis que celle-ci \u00e9tait d\u00e9tentrice contre valeur, mais il a soutenu que parce qu\u2019elle avait pris l\u2019effet en garantie collat\u00e9rale elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9tentrice r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Cette pr\u00e9tention vient \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un arr\u00eat unanime de notre Cour confirmant un jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec (Bonenfant c. La Banque Canadienne de Commerce)[5]. On a jug\u00e9 que dans de telles conditions cette banque \u00e9tait d\u00e9tentrice r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, au moins jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence du montant de la dette en garantie collat\u00e9rale de laquelle l\u2019effet lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9. Ici, l\u2019acte de vente fait voir que le montant d\u00fb \u00e0 la Banque d\u00e9passait celui des cr\u00e9ances c\u00e9d\u00e9es et dont elle touchait en totalit\u00e9 le prix vers\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, \u00e9tant d\u2019ailleurs oblig\u00e9e de subir une d\u00e9duction au cas de d\u00e9faut de livraison. Il faut donc admettre que l\u2019intim\u00e9e doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme aux droits de la Banque et comme cette derni\u00e8re a pris l\u2019effet avant l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance, il importe peu, si on le tient pour un billet au sens de la Loi sur les lettres de change, que la cession subs\u00e9quente \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e ait eu lieu alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en souffrance, l\u2019article 57 ne faisant pas de distinction \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nIl faut donc rechercher si le document, base de l\u2019action, est vraiment un \u00abbillet\u00bb au sens de la Loi sur les lettres de change. Pour cela il faut qu\u2019il soit sans condition (art. 176.1). Il est \u00e9vident que l\u2019effet dont il s\u2019agit n\u2019est sans condition que si on le consid\u00e8re ind\u00e9pendamment du contrat de vente conditionnelle. D\u00e8s que l\u2019on consid\u00e8re le tout, la premi\u00e8re condition d\u00e9montre que la promesse de payer est conditionnelle: advenant la reprise de l\u2019effet vendu, l\u2019acheteur est lib\u00e9r\u00e9. On ne saurait douter que le m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat doit se produire advenant d\u00e9faut de livraison. Ici, la preuve d\u00e9montre que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a acquis les droits d\u00e9coulant du contrat de vente conditionnelle et du \u00abbillet\u00bb comme un tout. On voit qu\u2019elle a fait publier des avis comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une vente de cr\u00e9ance. Il est clair qu\u2019elle voulait \u00eatre en mesure d\u2019exercer les droits d\u00e9coulant du contrat de vente aussi bien que ceux d\u00e9coulant du \u00abbillet\u00bb. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en vue de l\u2019institution de la poursuite qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9tach\u00e9 le \u00abbillet\u00bb pour pr\u00e9tendre le consid\u00e9rer comme un contrat distinct et inconditionnel. Nous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0 nous demander ce que serait la situation si l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et avant elle la Banque, avaient pris le \u00abbillet\u00bb d\u00e9tach\u00e9 du contrat. Ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9, dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, c\u2019est le tout. En examinant le tout, il est impossible d\u2019en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que la promesse de l\u2019acheteur est inconditionnelle. Ce n\u2019est donc pas un billet. Il faut signaler que le contrat produit en la pr\u00e9sente cause diff\u00e8re de celui qui figurait sur le billet qui a fait l\u2019objet de la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans Killoran c.

Avant d\u2019avoir pu se relever, il fut frapp\u00e9 accidentellement \u00e0 la t\u00eate par la botte d\u2019un autre \u00e9colier qui glissait derri\u00e8re lui. Il n\u2019y avait pas de surveillant \u00e0 cet endroit. L\u2019action est bas\u00e9e sur les motifs que cette pente durant la saison d\u2019hiver repr\u00e9sentait un danger inh\u00e9rent, qu\u2019on avait fait d\u00e9faut d\u2019y parer par des moyens raisonnables et qu\u2019il y avait eu manque de surveillance. Le juge au proc\u00e8s partagea la responsabilit\u00e9 et en attribua 75 pour-cent aux d\u00e9fendeurs et 25 pour-cent \u00e0 la victime. Seuls les d\u00e9fendeurs en appel\u00e8rent de ce jugement. La Cour d\u2019appel l\u2019a infirm\u00e9 et a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action. Le demandeur en appela \u00e0 cette Cour. Arr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre accueilli.\nLe juge au proc\u00e8s \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 d\u2019attribuer aux d\u00e9fendeurs une responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019au moins 75 pour-cent. En principe, il n\u2019y a pas de faute \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 des enfants normaux de s\u2019amuser \u00e0 glisser sur une glissade. Un tel amusement peut parfois, cependant, suivant les circonstances ou en l\u2019absence de certaines pr\u00e9cautions, offrir certains dangers pr\u00e9visibles. Dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019accident s\u2019est produit dans un endroit exclusivement destin\u00e9 en tout temps de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00e0 servir aux \u00e9coliers comme passage du trottoir de la municipalit\u00e9 \u00e0 la cour de l\u2019\u00e9cole. Les autorit\u00e9s n\u2019ignoraient pas le danger et avaient donn\u00e9 des instructions au concierge de sabler au besoin et interdisait aux enfants d\u2019y glisser. Dans le cas o\u00f9 un dommage est caus\u00e9 \u00e0 un \u00e9l\u00e8ve par un de ses condisciples, pendant qu\u2019ils sont sous la surveillance des instituteurs, il appartient \u00e0 ces derniers de repousser la pr\u00e9somption de responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019art. 1054 du Code Civil. Dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019invoquer cette pr\u00e9somption. Les d\u00e9fendeurs \u00e9taient clairement en faute. La preuve \u00e9tablit le d\u00e9faut des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s des d\u00e9fendeurs de voir \u00e0 l\u2019entretien de cette pente et de satisfaire au devoir de surveillance des enfants confi\u00e9s \u00e0 leurs soins.\nNegligence\u2014Liability\u2014School Commissioners\u2014Schoolboy injured after falling while sliding in entrance to school yard\u2014Grounds in icy condition and used as a slide by the boys\u2014Lack of maintenance and supervision\u2014Civil Code, art. 1054.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s son, an 8-year old schoolboy, was injured when he fell while using as a slide the passage-way used as an entrance from the street to the defendants\u2019 school, the surface of which, having a slope of 20 to 30 degrees, was in an icy condition. Before he could get up, another boy who was sliding behind struck him accidentally on the head with his boot. There was no supervisor at that location. The action alleged that this slope represented during the winter months an inherent danger, that there had been default in using reasonable means to correct it and that there had been lack of supervision. The trial judge assessed the fault at 75 per cent against the defendants and 25 per cent against the victim. The defendants only appealed from that judgment. The Court of Appeal reversed it and dismissed the action. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe trial judge was justified in assessing the defendants with at least 75 per cent of the liability. In principle, there is no fault in permitting normal children to have fun by sliding on a slide. However, such play can sometimes, depending on the circumstances or the lack of certain precautions, present certain foreseeable dangers. In the present case, the accident occurred on a location used exclusively all year round by the schoolboys as a passage-way from the sidewalk of the municipality to the school yard. The authorities knew of the danger and had given instructions to the janitor to spread sand if necessary and had forbidden the boys from using it as a slide. When a schoolboy is injured by another, while under the supervision of a schoolmaster, the onus of rebutting the presumption of liability under art. 1054 of the Civil Code is on the schoolmaster. In the present case, it was not necessary to invoke that presumption. The defendants were clearly at fault. The evidence established the lack of maintenance on the part of the defendants\u2019 employees and the lack of supervision.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec[1], reversing a judgment of Robinson J. Appeal allowed.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec1, infirmant un jugement du Juge Robinson. Appel accueilli.\nGilles Godin, c.r., pour le demandeur, appelant.\nMichel Rioux, pour les d\u00e9fendeurs, intim\u00e9s.\nLe jugement de la Cour fut rendu par\nLE JUGE FAUTEUX:\u2014Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un pourvoi contre un arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel[2], infirmant un jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure qui condamnait les intim\u00e9s \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, en sa qualit\u00e9 de tuteur de Gilles Chartier, une somme de $15,255.48, \u00e0 titre de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nLes faits donnant lieu \u00e0 cette cause se passent le 8 janvier 1958, sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la Commission scolaire administr\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9s, soit \u00e0 l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie St-Germain d\u2019Outremont. A ce temps, les \u00e9coliers devaient, pour entrer dans le b\u00e2timent de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie, utiliser une entr\u00e9e donnant sur la cour de l\u2019\u00e9cole et, pour acc\u00e9der \u00e0 cette cour, devaient n\u00e9cessairement, en quittant le trottoir de la rue Bellingham, s\u2019engager et descendre dans un passage longeant, \u00e0 ciel ouvert, le b\u00e2timent et accusant sur une faible distance une pente abrupte d\u2019environ 20 \u00e0 30 degr\u00e9s. A cause de cette pente et de la circulation des enfants, ce passage devenait souvent glac\u00e9 durant la saison d\u2019hiver et, \u00e0 moins d\u2019\u00eatre alors couvert de sable ou autres substances, offrait, \u00e0 la connaissance des ma\u00eetres, une v\u00e9ritable glissoire que ces \u00e9coliers de 6 \u00e0 14 ans ne manquaient gu\u00e8re d\u2019utiliser comme telle, nonobstant l\u2019interdiction qui leur en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. Telle \u00e9tait la situation et telle \u00e9tait, depuis deux ou trois jours, la condition dangereuse de ce passage,\u2014suivant la preuve retenue par le juge au proc\u00e8s,\u2014lorsque le 8 janvier, comme d\u2019ailleurs tous les autres jours de classe, une trentaine ou quarantaine d\u2019\u00e9coliers devaient s\u2019y engager apr\u00e8s \u00eatre all\u00e9s prendre le repas du midi \u00e0 la maison. En l\u2019absence du surveillant \u00e0 cet endroit, les enfants se lanc\u00e8rent sur cette glissoire et ce d\u2019une mani\u00e8re d\u00e9crite comme suit au t\u00e9moignage d\u2019Alain Chartier, fr\u00e8re a\u00een\u00e9 de Gilles: ils se garochaient sur la glissade, alors, il y avait des bousculades, \u00e7a tombait\u2026 Certains d\u2019entre eux, apr\u00e8s avoir ainsi descendu la pente, la remontaient pour glisser \u00e0 nouveau au lieu de se rendre \u00e0 la cour. A la suite d\u2019une deuxi\u00e8me glissade, Gilles Chartier, alors \u00e2g\u00e9 de 8 ans, fit une chute au bas de la pente. Saisi d\u2019un \u00e9tourdissement, il ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas encore relev\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019un \u00e9colier plus \u00e2g\u00e9, qui glissait derri\u00e8re lui, tr\u00e9bucha lui-m\u00eame au m\u00eame endroit et le heurta, avec sa botte, \u00e0 la tempe gauche. Le surveillant qui se trouvait dans la cour fut alert\u00e9, l\u2019enfant fut conduit \u00e0 la clinique de l\u2019\u00e9cole et, par la suite, \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital d\u2019o\u00f9 il ne sortit qu\u2019apr\u00e8s plusieurs semaines, affect\u00e9 d\u2019un trouble visuel lui infligeant pour la vie une incapacit\u00e9 admise de 13 pour-cent. D\u2019o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9sente action en dommages, bas\u00e9e, en somme, sur la conjugaison du danger inh\u00e9rent au caract\u00e8re abrupt de cette pente durant la saison d\u2019hiver, du d\u00e9faut d\u2019y parer par des moyens raisonnables et du manque de surveillance des enfants dont les agissements contribuaient \u00e0 la conversion de ce passage en glissoire.\nLa Cour sup\u00e9rieure jugea, en substance, que les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s des intim\u00e9s, charg\u00e9s de l\u2019entretien de ce passage, du soin et de la discipline des enfants, avaient manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs devoirs et que si, comme ils l\u2019avaient affirm\u00e9, ils avaient interdit aux enfants de glisser \u00e0 cet endroit, ils ne s\u2019\u00e9taient gu\u00e8re souci\u00e9s d\u2019assurer, par une surveillance raisonnable, que cette directive fut suivie mais qu\u2019ils avaient plut\u00f4t tol\u00e9r\u00e9 leur conduite. La Cour nota, d\u2019autre part, que nonobstant son \u00e2ge, Gilles Chartier, qui \u00e9tait un \u00e9colier brillant, aurait d\u00fb r\u00e9aliser qu\u2019il s\u2019exposait au danger en participant \u00e0 ces glissades d\u00e9sordonn\u00e9es. Jugeant que la responsabilit\u00e9 devait \u00eatre partag\u00e9e, la Cour en attribua une proportion de 75 pour-cent aux intim\u00e9s et 25 pour-cent \u00e0 la victime et condamna les intim\u00e9s \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l\u2019appelant \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 une somme de $15,255.48, repr\u00e9sentant les trois-quarts des dommages prouv\u00e9s.\nSeuls les intim\u00e9s appel\u00e8rent de ce jugement; de sorte que il y a chose jug\u00e9e en ce qui concerne la part de responsabilit\u00e9 attribu\u00e9e au jeune Chartier par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure. En Cour d\u2019appel, on a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que la question \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9tait de savoir s\u2019il est fautif de permettre \u00e0 des jeunes gar\u00e7ons normaux de s\u2019amuser en glissant sur une glissade; et on d\u00e9clara que cette question avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solue de fa\u00e7on n\u00e9gative dans la cause de L\u2019\u0153uvre des terrains de jeux de Qu\u00e9bec v. Cannon[3], et qu\u2019au m\u00eame effet se trouvaient les arr\u00eats dans Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al v. Lamoureux[4], O\u2019Brien v. Les Commissaires d\u2019\u00e9coles de la Municipalit\u00e9 de Ste-Ursule[5] et Lavall\u00e9e v. Les Commissaires d\u2019\u00e9coles pour la Municipalit\u00e9 de St-Germain de Grantham[6]. D\u2019autre part, on pr\u00e9cisa que la condamnation de la cit\u00e9 dans Cit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke v. Ferland[7] \u00e9tait due \u00e0 une circonstance sp\u00e9ciale, soit \u00e0 un d\u00e9faut de surveillance qui avait permis \u00e0 un enfant de chausser des patins et de s\u2019aventurer sur la glissoire am\u00e9nag\u00e9e par la ville. On nota enfin que le jeune Chartier avait gliss\u00e9 volontairement. L\u2019appel fut donc maintenu, le jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure infirm\u00e9 et l\u2019action de l\u2019appelant \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 fut rejet\u00e9e. De l\u00e0 l\u2019appel \u00e0 cette Cour.\nAvec le plus grand respect pour l\u2019opinion exprim\u00e9e en Cour d\u2019appel, il faut dire imm\u00e9diatement que nous sommes tous d\u2019avis que le juge au proc\u00e8s, qui a vu et entendu les t\u00e9moins, \u00e9tait, en raison des faits qu\u2019il a retenus comme prouv\u00e9s, justifi\u00e9 en droit d\u2019attribuer aux intim\u00e9s une responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019au moins 75 pour-cent. Certes et en principe, il n\u2019y a pas de faute \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 des enfants normaux de s\u2019amuser \u00e0 glisser sur une glissade. Inoffensif en soi, un tel amusement peut parfois, cependant, suivant les circonstances ou en l\u2019absence de certaines pr\u00e9cautions, offrir certains dangers pr\u00e9visibles. Il va de soi que ces circonstances sont \u00e9minemment variables ainsi qu\u2019en t\u00e9moignent les causes cit\u00e9es aux motifs du jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel. Toutefois, ce qui distingue fondamentalement le cas qui nous occupe de ceux qu\u2019on a d\u00fb consid\u00e9rer dans ces causes, c\u2019est que dans celles-l\u00e0 il s\u2019agissait d\u2019accidents survenus au cours de jeux pratiqu\u00e9s dans un terrain de jeux, de r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation ou un parc, alors que dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019accident s\u2019est produit dans un endroit exclusivement destin\u00e9 en tout temps de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00e0 servir aux \u00e9coliers comme passage du trottoir de la municipalit\u00e9 \u00e0 la cour de l\u2019\u00e9cole. Les glissades auxquelles ce groupe d\u2019enfants de 6 \u00e0 14 ans se livrait sur cette pente abrupte, sans aucune surveillance, dans le d\u00e9sordre, la bousculade et la cohue, offraient s\u00fbrement pour les plus jeunes sinon pour leurs a\u00een\u00e9s un danger que les autorit\u00e9s n\u2019ignoraient pas et qu\u2019elles entendaient conjurer en donnant des instructions au concierge de sabler au besoin ce passage et en interdisant aux enfants d\u2019y glisser. Ces directives n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9es et on ne para\u00eet pas s\u2019\u00eatre souci\u00e9 de voir \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elles le fussent. Les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s des intim\u00e9s \u00e0 qui \u00e9taient confi\u00e9es la garde et la surveillance de ces enfants, \u00e9taient tenus de les prot\u00e9ger, par une vigilance raisonnable, contre un danger qu\u2019ils avaient ainsi jug\u00e9 pr\u00e9visible et que, en fait, ils avaient pr\u00e9vu. Dans le cas o\u00f9 un dommage est caus\u00e9 \u00e0 un \u00e9l\u00e8ve par un de ses condisciples, pendant qu\u2019ils sont sous la surveillance des instituteurs, il appartient \u00e0 ces derniers de repousser la pr\u00e9somption de responsabilit\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e9dictent \u00e0 leur endroit les dispositions de l\u2019article 1054 C.C. Dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019invoquer cette pr\u00e9somption. La preuve \u00e9tablit le d\u00e9faut des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s des intim\u00e9s de voir, comme ils y \u00e9taient tenus et pouvaient facilement le faire, \u00e0 l\u2019entretien de cette pente abrupte et glissante, et de satisfaire au devoir de surveillance des enfants confi\u00e9s \u00e0 leurs soins. L\u2019accident r\u00e9sulte de la conjugaison de ces fautes qui entra\u00eene la responsabilit\u00e9 des intim\u00e9s.\nPour ces raisons, nous sommes tous d\u2019accord que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu, la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel infirm\u00e9e et le dispositif du jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure r\u00e9tabli; le tout avec d\u00e9pens en cette Cour et en Cour d\u2019appel.\nAppel accueilli avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureur du demandeur, appelant: G.

L\u2019intim\u00e9e oppose, entre autres moyens, que l\u2019appel \u00e0 cette Cour est futile.

The respondent pleaded, inter alia, that the appeal to this Court was futile. The applicant argued that the judge before whom such a motion is presented does not have to consider whether there are reasonable grounds of appeal because it was up to the Court and not to a judge in chambers to dismiss a futile appeal summarily.\nHeld: The application should be granted.\nIt should be left to the tribunal to decide whether an appeal should be dismissed summarily because of its futility.\nThe second ground invoked by the respondent that the applicant had, a few days after the first judgment, hypothecated some of his immovables in favour of his attorney in the case and sold them to a third party subject to that hypothec, could not be entertained.

Dans ces circonstances, j\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 au procureur de l\u2019appelant de d\u00e9clarer par \u00e9crit quels sont les motifs raisonnables d\u2019appel vis\u00e9s par son certificat \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate. Cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\nIl faut maintenant ajouter que l\u2019appelant a soutenu \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa requ\u00eate que, de toute fa\u00e7on, le juge qui en est saisi n\u2019a pas \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer s\u2019il existe r\u00e9ellement des motifs raisonnables d\u2019appel parce que c\u2019est au tribunal et non \u00e0 un juge qu\u2019il appartient de rejeter sommairement un appel futile. D\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a invoqu\u00e9 un jugement rendu par mon coll\u00e8gue, le juge Spence, le 5 d\u00e9cembre 1967, par lequel il a refus\u00e9 une requ\u00eate semblable par le motif suivant:\nI am of the opinion therefore that the appeal is so hopeless that I could not justify requiring the defendant to expend the moneys necessary to defend the appeal with no hope of recovering the costs after success and that would be the effect of granting leave to appeal in forma pauperis.\n(Bridge c. Herzog, non publi\u00e9.)\nApr\u00e8s avoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 avec mon coll\u00e8gue, je suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion avec laquelle il est d\u2019accord qu\u2019il vaut mieux laisser au tribunal le soin de juger si un appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 sommairement parce qu\u2019il est futile.\nQuant \u00e0 l\u2019autre moyen invoqu\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, je ne vois pas comment je pourrais en tenir compte alors que le d\u00e9lai pour l\u2019institution d\u2019une action paulienne est expir\u00e9.\nPour ces motifs, la requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelant est accord\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens \u00e0 suivre le sort de l\u2019appel, l\u2019appelant est dispens\u00e9 de fournir cautionnement et de verser des honoraires au r\u00e9gistraire et son appel est admis sans autre formalit\u00e9 sous r\u00e9serve du droit de l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019en demander le rejet.\nRequ\u00eate accord\u00e9e.",

The possession of the films and their showing on three occasions to some ten persons were admitted. The respondent admitted also that the films were obscene. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment at trial. The Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Court of Appeal has rightly concluded that the showing of obscene pictures to a friend or of showing an obscene film within an individual residence does not per se constitute a criminal offence and is not sufficient to establish the intention to circulate the films.

En date du 15 juin 1967, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ainsi que le procureur de la Couronne produisirent pour valoir comme preuve dans la pr\u00e9sente cause une admission de faits dans laquelle certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019infraction \u00e9taient admis, notamment:\n1. Le pr\u00e9venu admet que des films ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9s en sa possession par la Police Provinciale \u00e0 son appartement en mai 1965;\n2. Le pr\u00e9venu admet que lesdits films sont obsc\u00e8nes au sens pr\u00e9vu par le Code Criminel, \u00e0 l\u2019article 150, paragraphe 1-a;\n3. Le pr\u00e9venu admet que lesdits films obsc\u00e8nes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 projet\u00e9s sur \u00e9cran \u00e0 son appartement par lui-m\u00eame et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vus par une dizaine de personnes en octobre 1964 et en mars-avril 1965;\n4. Les parties admettent que les pr\u00e9sentes admissions constituent la preuve compl\u00e8te de part et d\u2019autre, se r\u00e9servant, cependant, tout droit de plaider sur toutes questions de droit qui se soul\u00e8vent dans le pr\u00e9sent proc\u00e8s et de donner chacun leur interpr\u00e9tation de la preuve ainsi soumise.\nIl n\u2019y eut aucune enqu\u00eate dans cette cause et aucun t\u00e9moin ne fut entendu.\nLe Juge de premi\u00e8re instance en date du 8 septembre 1967 acquittait le pr\u00e9venu de l\u2019accusation telle que port\u00e9e contre lui. Le 13 juin 1968, la Cour du banc de la reine[2], form\u00e9e des honorables Juges Pratte, Hyde et Rinfret, confirmait le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance et rejetait l\u2019appel de la Couronne avec dissidence du savant Juge Rinfret.\nLa possession des films et la projection de ces films en trois occasions devant une dizaine de personnes sont admises; les films ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s obsc\u00e8nes et ceci est \u00e9galement admis par l\u2019accus\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame.\nLa seule question qui se pose est de savoir si le pr\u00e9venu les avait en sa possession \u00abaux fins de les mettre en circulation\u00bb.\nLe savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a dit dans ses motifs:\nPour ma part, je crois que la mise en circulation dont parle l\u2019article 150 du Code criminel doit avoir un caract\u00e8re public, tout comme les autres actions d\u00e9fendues par le m\u00eame article, soit la publication et la distribution de tels objets. Le fait que dans le m\u00eame article la mise en circulation soit juxtapos\u00e9e au mot \u00abpublication\u00bb qui contient le mot \u00abpublic\u00bb et au mot \u00abdistribution\u00bb, me convainc que la mise en circulation doit avoir un caract\u00e8re public.\nDans la Cour d\u2019appel, le Juge Pratte a dit:\nSelon le sens ordinaire des mots, mettre une chose en circulation c\u2019est la faire passer de main en main, ce qui \u00e9voque l\u2019id\u00e9e de dessaisisse- ment, temporaire ou d\u00e9finitif: ce que l\u2019on garde pour soi n\u2019est pas en circulation. Mais l\u2019on invoque une d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019Appel de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse (Regina v. Berringer, 122 C.C.C., 350) pour pr\u00e9tendre que l\u2019article 150 vise \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir toute communication d\u2019images ou autres choses obsc\u00e8nes, et que par cons\u00e9quent, les mots \u00abmettre en circulation\u00bb doivent \u00eatre entendus de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 comprendre m\u00eame le seul fait de montrer priv\u00e9ment une image obsc\u00e8ne. Or, dit-on, projeter un film, c\u2019est en faire voir les images, donc les mettre en circulation.\nSauf tout le respect d\u00fb aux tenants de cette opinion, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord; et cela pour les raisons que voici.\nD\u2019abord, s\u2019agissant de mati\u00e8re p\u00e9nale, les termes employ\u00e9s par le l\u00e9gislateur doivent \u00eatre pris dans leur sens ordinaire: c\u2019est une r\u00e8gle fondamentale d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation.\nEn second lieu, il se trouve que la communication, par la vue, d\u2019une image obsc\u00e8ne, est pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe (2)a de l\u2019article 150 ci-apr\u00e8s:\n\u00abCommet une infraction, quiconque, sciemment et sans justification ni excuse l\u00e9gitime, vend, expose \u00e0 la vue du public, ou a en sa possession \u00e0 une telle fin, quelque \u00e9crit, image, mod\u00e8le, disque de phonographe ou autre chose obsc\u00e8ne;\u00bb\nLes termes de cette disposition font voir clairement que le l\u00e9gislateur a entendu faire une distinction entre la mise en circulation (art. 150(1)a), d\u2019une part, et l\u2019exposition \u00e0 la vue d\u2019autre part (art. 150(2)a). Si l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 devait \u00eatre suivie, il faudrait conclure que le fait de montrer une image obsc\u00e8ne, que ce soit priv\u00e9ment ou en public, est toujours un acte criminel; et comme l\u2019article 154 \u00e9dicte la m\u00eame peine pour la mise en circulation que pour l\u2019exposition \u00e0 la vue du public, il s\u2019ensuivrait que la disposition du paragraphe 2a concernant l\u2019exposition \u00e0 la vue du public serait absolument superflue. Or, on sait que le l\u00e9gislateur ne parle pas inutilement.\nSi donc l\u2019exposition \u00ab\u00e0 la vue du public\u00bb est mentionn\u00e9e dans le paragraphe 2a, c\u2019est que le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu que celle-l\u00e0 seule, et non pas l\u2019exposition priv\u00e9e, constitue un crime.\nJe dirais donc que le fait de montrer des images obsc\u00e8nes \u00e0 un ami ou de projeter un film obsc\u00e8ne dans l\u2019intimit\u00e9 de son foyer n\u2019est pas en soi un crime, ni ne suffit pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019intention de les mettre en circulation, encore qu\u2019il puisse aider \u00e0 prouver cette intention. Si, par exemple, il \u00e9tait \u00e9tabli, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, que Rioux avait projet\u00e9 ces films en vue de trouver un acheteur ou un emprunteur, l\u2019accusation serait prouv\u00e9e. Mais tel n\u2019est pas le cas. Le fait que Rioux ait eu ces films en sa possession, pendant plusieurs mois porte plut\u00f4t \u00e0 penser qu\u2019il les a projet\u00e9s pour sa propre satisfaction et celle de ses amis, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019avec l\u2019intention de les mettre en circulation.\net le Juge Hyde:\nI see no intent by the use of the word \u201ccirculates\u201d or \u201ccirculation\u201d to broaden the offence. Dissemination by circulation must be of a public nature. I think of circulation as used in reference to a circulating library or a newspaper or periodical. The Shorter Oxford Dictionary, for example, gives \u201cTo pass from place to place, from hand to hand, or from mouth to mouth; to pass into the hands of readers, as a newspaper\u201d. The recently published Random House Dictionary equates it with distribution, thus: \u201cTo be distributed or sold, especially over a wide area\u201d.\nBefore I am prepared to hold that private use of written matter or pictures within an individual\u2019s residence may constitute a criminal offence, I require a much more specific text of law than we are now dealing with. It would have been very simple for parliament to have included the word \u201cexhibit\u201d in this section if it had wished to cover this situation.\nJe souscris aux motifs de ces savants Juges et je ne crois pas n\u00e9cessaire de rien y ajouter. En cons\u00e9quence je rejetterais l\u2019appel.\nAppel rejet\u00e9.\nProcureur de l\u2019appelante: L.

Le Conseil fut d\u2019opinion que les travailleurs de l\u2019unit\u00e9 propos\u00e9e \u00e9taient employ\u00e9s \u00e0 une entreprise ou affaire \u00e0 laquelle s\u2019applique la premi\u00e8re partie de la Loi sur les relations industrielles et sur les enqu\u00eates visant les diff\u00e9rends du travail, S.R.C. 1952, c. 152, et que, de plus, cette unit\u00e9 \u00e9tait une unit\u00e9 habile \u00e0 n\u00e9gocier collectivement. La compagnie appelante s\u2019est alors adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure pour obtenir la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019un bref d\u2019assignation pour faire surseoir \u00e0 toute proc\u00e9dure subs\u00e9quente et pour faire reviser la d\u00e9cision du Conseil. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance accorda la d\u00e9livrance du bref. La Cour d\u2019appel rejeta la requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelante pour le motif que la Cour sup\u00e9rieure n\u2019avait, en vertu de l\u2019art. 846 du nouveau Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, aucun pouvoir de surveillance ou de contr\u00f4le sur les proc\u00e9dures et d\u00e9cisions du Conseil. L\u2019appelante a obtenu la permission d\u2019en appeler \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre accueilli.\nTant en vertu de sa loi organique qu\u2019en vertu des pouvoirs inh\u00e9rents \u00e0 sa fonction, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure poss\u00e8de depuis avant la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de surveillance et contr\u00f4le sur les organismes qui rel\u00e8vent maintenant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement et qui exercent une action judiciaire ou quasi judiciaire dans les affaires de la province et rendent des d\u00e9cisions qui y sont ex\u00e9cutoires. De sorte que toute personne qui se pr\u00e9tend l\u00e9s\u00e9e dans ses droits, par suite d\u2019un exc\u00e8s de juridiction de la part d\u2019un organisme f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, peut, afin de les faire reconna\u00eetre et en assurer le respect, recourir \u00e0 cette autorit\u00e9. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure a donc juridiction pour contr\u00f4ler l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une d\u00e9cision quasi judiciaire rendue par le Conseil canadien, lorsque cette ex\u00e9cution doit affecter les droits des justiciables de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et y \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e. En l\u2019absence de moyens prescrits pour faire appel \u00e0 ce pouvoir de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, les justiciables peuvent, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la disposition de l\u2019art. 20 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, recourir \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure applicable dans le cas des tribunaux administratifs relevant de la comp\u00e9tence de la l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec.\nLe Conseil a, prima facie, exc\u00e9d\u00e9 sa juridiction en exer\u00e7ant le pouvoir d\u2019accr\u00e9ditation que lui conf\u00e8re la premi\u00e8re partie de la Loi sur les relations industrielles et sur les enqu\u00eates visant les diff\u00e9rends du travail. L\u2019entreprise de l\u2019appelante n\u2019entre pas dans l\u2019une des cat\u00e9gories d\u2019entreprises mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019art. 53 de cette Loi. Tenant compte des faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la requ\u00eate, et non pas des faits que le Conseil a jug\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9s devant lui, et vu que les op\u00e9rations de l\u2019appelante sont conduites \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res ou dans ses environs imm\u00e9diats mais que la requ\u00eate ne fait pas voir que ses op\u00e9rations se rattachent \u00e0 du transport extra-provincial, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9, \u00e0 ce stade pr\u00e9liminaire de la proc\u00e9dure, d\u2019accorder la d\u00e9livrance du bref d\u2019assignation.\nLabour\u2014Procedure\u2014Motion to evoke\u2014Canada Labour Relations Board\u2014Board subject to the superintending and reforming power of the Superior Court\u2014Code of Civil Procedure, art. 33, 846\u2014Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 152.\nThe Canada Labour Relations Board granted the petition of the respondent union to be certified as bargaining agent of a group of employees of the appellant company employed in its maritime operations within the harbour of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res or in its immediate vicinity on the St. Lawrence River, in the province of Quebec. The Board held that the employees of the proposed unit were employed in connection with an undertaking or business to which Part I of the Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 152, applied and that, furthermore, this unit was a unit competent to bargain collectively. The appellant company petitioned the Superior Court for the issuance of a writ of summons to suspend all subsequent proceedings and to have the decision of the Board revised. The trial judge granted the issuance of the writ. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant\u2019s petition on the ground that the Superior Court did not have, under art. 846 of the new Code of Civil Procedure, any superintending or reforming power over the proceedings and decisions of the Board. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe Superior Court has since before Confederation, as much by virtue of its constitutive statute as by virtue of the powers inherent in its functions, the authority of superintendence and reform over the bodies now under the jurisdiction of the Parliament exercizing a judicial or quasi-judicial action over provincial undertakings and which make decisions enforceable therein. Consequently, any person claiming that its rights have been encroached upon as a result of an excess of jurisdiction on the part of a federal body, can, in order to have these rights recognized and to ensure that they be respected, have recourse to that authority. The Superior Court has therefore jurisdiction to control the execution of a quasi-judicial decision rendered by the Board, when that execution affects the rights of the people of the province of Quebec and is to be carried out therein. In the absence of prescribed provisions to invoke this power of the Superior Court, one can have recourse to the procedure applicable in the case of administrative tribunals under the jurisdiction of the legislature of Quebec, as provided for by art. 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nThe Board has, prima facie, exceeded its jurisdiction in exercising the power of certification given to it by Part I of the Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act. The undertaking of the appellant does not fall under any of the categories of undertakings mentioned in s. 53 of the Act. Taking into account the facts alleged in the motion, and not the facts as found by the Board, and considering that the operations of the appellant are pursued at Trois-Rivi\u00e8res or in its immediate vicinity but that the petition did not disclose that its operations were in connection with extra-provincial transport, the trial judge was justified, at this preliminary stage of the procedure, to grant the issuance of the writ of summons.\nAPPEAL from two judgments of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], reversing a judgment of Dorion C.J. Appeal allowed.\nAPPEL de deux jugements de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec1, infirmant un jugement du Juge en Chef Dorion. Appel accueilli.\nL\u00e9opold Langlois, c.r., pour l\u2019appelante. Rodrigue B\u00e9dard, c.r., et Roger Thibodeau, c.r., pour les intim\u00e9s, le Conseil et R.L. Fournier et J.L. MacDougall.\nPhil Cutler, Ross Goodwin et Pierre Langlois, pour l\u2019intim\u00e9, le Syndicat.\nLe jugement de la Cour fut rendu par\nLE JUGE FAUTEUX:\u2014Le Syndicat intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate au Conseil canadien des relations ouvri\u00e8res, ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9 le Conseil canadien, pour \u00eatre accr\u00e9dit\u00e9 comme agent n\u00e9gociateur d\u2019un certain groupe de salari\u00e9s de l\u2019appelante pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux op\u00e9rations maritimes qu\u2019elle poursuit dans les limites du port de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res ou ses environs imm\u00e9diats sur le fleuve Saint-Laurent, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. L\u2019unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation propos\u00e9e par le Syndicat est ainsi d\u00e9crite dans sa demande:\nAll boats running D.O.T. Pilots to ships belonging to the Three River Boatmen.\nL\u2019appelante a contest\u00e9 cette requ\u00eate. Elle a soumis principalement et avec vigueur qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une entreprise locale, intra-provinciale qui, en raison de sa nature, n\u2019est pas comprise dans la cat\u00e9gorie des entreprises ou affaires auxquelles s\u2019applique la premi\u00e8re partie de la Loi sur les relations industrielles et sur les enqu\u00eates visant les diff\u00e9rends du travail, S.R.C. 1952, c. 152, ci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9sign\u00e9e sous le nom de Loi sur les diff\u00e9rends du travail. Et sans pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 cette objection fondamentale, l\u2019appelante a plaid\u00e9 que l\u2019unit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de laquelle se rapporte la demande du Syndicat ne constitue pas une unit\u00e9 habile \u00e0 n\u00e9gocier collectivement et que la majorit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s de cette unit\u00e9 ne sont pas membres en r\u00e8gle du Syndicat. Apr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate et audition, le Conseil canadien rejeta l\u2019objection principale de l\u2019appelante en s\u2019appuyant sur les consid\u00e9rations suivantes quant aux faits:\nRespondent operates five boats designated as service boats or ships\u2019 tenders at the harbour of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res to provide the transport of pilots from and to the Canada Department of Transport office at Trois-Rivi\u00e8res to be put aboard or brought ashore from ships proceeding up or down the St. Lawrence River including trans ocean, eastern coastal and domestic shipping in order to provide such ships with the pilotage services required for navigation purposes on the section of the St. Lawrence River serviced from the Trois-Rivi\u00e8res Canada Department of Transport station. The Respondent may be called upon also to transport on its boats customs officers and medical officers for other departments of the Government of Canada and shipping companies\u2019 agents on ships\u2019 business to ships pro- ceeding up river and may transport also ships\u2019 officers and crewmen from shore to ship and ship to shore for ships anchored in the river in the vicinity of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res on request of the ship\u2019s captain; however, the requirements for these services are irregular.\nIt is clear from the evidence that the primary purpose of the Respondent\u2019s undertaking in which its service boats are engaged is the transport of pilots from shore to ship and ship to shore to ships requiring pilotage services in proceeding up and down the St. Lawrence River. For this purpose the Respondent provides a 24 hour per day service operating on a 3 shift per diem basis. These service boats operate within a radius of some 5 miles up and down stream from the harbour. The crew on each of these service boats consists of a captain and a seaman. The shore based personnel employed by the Respondent to service these boats consists of 2 marine engineers, a mechanic, a machinist, a maintenance man and a labourer. All of these employees together with a clerk who is in charge of a shop maintained by the Respondent at St. Antoine de Tilly where its boats are built and repaired comprise the proposed bargaining unit.\nEn droit, le Conseil canadien invoqua la d\u00e9cision du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans Paquet et al v. Corporation of Pilots for and below the Harbour of Quebec and Attorney General for Canada[2] et la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans Eastern Canada Stevedoring Company Limited[3]. Et se r\u00e9sumant, le Conseil canadien disposa en ces termes de l\u2019objection fondamentale de l\u2019appelante:\nThe Board concludes on the evidence that the Respondent\u2019s primary business involves directly an aspect of pilotage. It has been held that the subject of pilotage falls exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada\u2014see Paquet v. Pilots\u2019 Corporation (1920) A.C. 1029. Furthermore to the limited extent that the Respondent provides services going beyond the subject of pilotage, it would appear that these services should be properly regarded as an essential part of navigation and shipping within the principles recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada in Eastern Canada Stevedoring Company Limited Reference (1955) S.C.R. 529.\n\u00c9tant ainsi d\u2019opinion que les travailleurs de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation propos\u00e9e \u00e9taient employ\u00e9s \u00e0 une entreprise ou affaire \u00e0 laquelle s\u2019applique la premi\u00e8re partie de la Loi sur les diff\u00e9rends du travail et que, de plus, cette unit\u00e9 \u00e9tait une unit\u00e9 habile \u00e0 n\u00e9gocier collectivement, le Conseil canadien accorda la demande d\u2019accr\u00e9ditation du Syndicat.\nC\u2019est alors que, afin de se pourvoir contre cette d\u00e9cision du Conseil canadien, l\u2019appelante, en janvier 1967, s\u2019adressa, par requ\u00eate, \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, district de Qu\u00e9bec, pour obtenir la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019un bref d\u2019assignation, adress\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9s, leur enjoignant de surseoir \u00e0 toute proc\u00e9dure d\u00e9coulant de cette d\u00e9cision, de transmettre le dossier \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et d\u2019y compara\u00eetre pour voir statuer sur la requ\u00eate et la demande d\u2019un jugement d\u00e9clarant que le Conseil canadien n\u2019a pas juridiction pour accr\u00e9diter le Syndicat comme agent n\u00e9gociateur de ses employ\u00e9s et revisant, en cons\u00e9quence, la d\u00e9cision du Conseil canadien. Cette requ\u00eate fut signifi\u00e9e au Conseil canadien, \u00e0 son bureau \u00e0 Ottawa, en en laissant une copie \u00e0 J. Lorne MacDougall, son administrateur en chef, et \u00e0 son bureau \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, en en laissant une copie \u00e0 Roger L. Fournier, agent des relations industrielles. Les intim\u00e9s comparurent devant M. le juge en chef Dorion, object\u00e8rent \u00e0 la d\u00e9livrance du bref d\u2019assignation et demand\u00e8rent qu\u2019il y e\u00fbt une enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9alablement \u00e0 la plaidoirie en droit. Cette demande fut refus\u00e9e. Le savant juge rappela, par ailleurs, en rendant subs\u00e9quemment jugement sur la requ\u00eate, le principe voulant que sur une requ\u00eate de ce genre, le juge ne soit pas appel\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9cider le fond du litige, qu\u2019il peut fort bien arriver que, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une enqu\u00eate et lorsque tous les faits relativement \u00e0 la cause auront \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9s, le Tribunal en vienne \u00e0 la conclusion que le rem\u00e8de demand\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9, mais que, pour ce qui est de la requ\u00eate demandant la d\u00e9livrance du bref, il faut s\u2019en rapporter aux faits qui sont all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la requ\u00eate.\nIl convient \u00e0 ce point de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux all\u00e9gations de faits contenues dans la requ\u00eate. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de les relater ici textuellement. Il suffit d\u2019indiquer l\u2019essence des faits qui sont pertinents et que le juge, au stade de la demande de la d\u00e9livrance du bref, a le droit sinon l\u2019obligation de tenir comme av\u00e9r\u00e9s. Voici ces faits: l\u2019appelante a sa principale place d\u2019affaires \u00e0 St-Antoine de Tilly, comt\u00e9 de Lotbini\u00e8re, o\u00f9 elle construit, r\u00e9pare et entretient des bateaux. Elle a aussi sur la rive nord du Saint-Laurent \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res une autre place d\u2019affaires consistant dans un terrain riverain, b\u00e2timents y \u00e9rig\u00e9s, et un quai, lou\u00e9s d\u2019un particulier, d\u2019o\u00f9 elle conduit les op\u00e9rations de quatre vedettes \u00e0 moteur, une remorque de rivi\u00e8re et un chaland, dont le port d\u2019attache est \u00e0 cet endroit. Ces divers bateaux sont utilis\u00e9s pour assister les navires qui man\u0153uvrent dans le port de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res ou au transbordement de passagers entre navires et rives du Saint-Laurent, dans les limites du port de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res ou ses environs imm\u00e9diats. Le chaland est utilis\u00e9 au transport de pi\u00e8ces lourdes entre navires et les rives du Saint-Laurent, toujours dans le port de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res et ses environs imm\u00e9diats. Ces services de l\u2019appelante sont requis et r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s par les propri\u00e9taires des navires auxquels ils sont rendus ou par leurs agents. Les taux en vigueur pour ces services sont n\u00e9goci\u00e9s et approuv\u00e9s par la Shipping Federation of Canada ou la Dominion Marine Association, associations qui entre elles groupent la presque totalit\u00e9 des propri\u00e9taires de navires naviguant sur le fleuve Saint-Laurent. Les bateaux de l\u2019appelante n\u2019ont jamais navigu\u00e9 ailleurs que dans les limites de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, soit toujours dans les environs imm\u00e9diats de la ville de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res sauf lorsqu\u2019ils ont \u00e0 descendre, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion, \u00e0 ses chantiers de St-Antoine de Tilly, comt\u00e9 de Lotbini\u00e8re. Enfin, on all\u00e8gue le fait que l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019appelante est d\u2019un caract\u00e8re exclusivement intra-provincial et que le Conseil canadien a m\u00e9sinterpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la preuve faite devant lui pour rendre la d\u00e9cision attaqu\u00e9e.\nApr\u00e8s avoir pris la requ\u00eate en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance consid\u00e9ra que les faits dont il devait tenir compte \u00e9taient ceux qui \u00e9taient all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la requ\u00eate et non ceux qui \u00e9taient relat\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision du Conseil canadien, que ces faits se rapportent exclusivement \u00e0 des op\u00e9rations de transport intra-provincial, que prima facie le Conseil canadien a exc\u00e9d\u00e9 sa juridiction en appliquant les dispositions de la Loi sur les diff\u00e9rends du travail aux activit\u00e9s de l\u2019appelante et que ces all\u00e9gations de faits, support\u00e9es par affidavit, justifient, en droit, les conclusions recherch\u00e9es dans la demande. Il consid\u00e9ra de plus que la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a juridiction pour contr\u00f4ler l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une d\u00e9cision rendue par le Conseil canadien, lorsque cette ex\u00e9cution doit se faire dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. En cons\u00e9quence, il accorda la requ\u00eate enjoignant aux intim\u00e9s de suspendre toute proc\u00e9dure et transmettre au greffe de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure le dossier complet de l\u2019affaire afin qu\u2019il soit d\u00e9termin\u00e9 si la d\u00e9cision du Conseil canadien est ex\u00e9cutoire quant aux employ\u00e9s de l\u2019appelante et il ordonna la suspension de toute proc\u00e9dure relative \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de cette d\u00e9cision.\nDe l\u00e0 deux appels distincts \u00e0 la Cour du banc de la reine[4], soit l\u2019appel conjoint du Conseil canadien et ses officiers MacDougall et Fournier et l\u2019appel du Syndicat. Ces appels furent entendus simultan\u00e9ment par un banc compos\u00e9 de MM. les juges Rinfret, Montgomery et Salvas. Le Syndicat, d\u2019une part, persista \u00e0 soutenir que le Conseil canadien avait juridiction en ce qui a trait aux relations entre l\u2019appelante et ses travailleurs. Le Conseil canadien, d\u2019autre part, adopta les arguments du Syndicat et ajouta que la Cour sup\u00e9rieure n\u2019avait, en vertu de l\u2019art. 846 du nouveau Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, aucun pouvoir de surveillance ou de contr\u00f4le sur ses proc\u00e9dures ou ses d\u00e9cisions. La Cour d\u2019appel accepta cette pr\u00e9tention du Conseil canadien et pour cette raison jugea inopportun de se prononcer sur l\u2019application de la Loi sur les diff\u00e9rends du travail et la juridiction du Conseil canadien en ce qui concerne les activit\u00e9s pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es de l\u2019appelante. Les appels furent maintenus et la requ\u00eate de la compagnie Three Rivers Boatman Ltd. fut rejet\u00e9e.\nL\u2019appelante demanda alors et obtint la permission d\u2019appeler \u00e0 cette Cour de ces jugements.\nAinsi qu\u2019il appert des motifs donn\u00e9s par M. le juge Montgomery, avec l\u2019accord de ses coll\u00e8gues, la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel se fonde sur les dispositions du premier paragraphe de l\u2019art. 846 C.P.C., lues \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de celles de l\u2019art. 33 du nouveau Code qui \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 en vigueur au temps de l\u2019institution des proc\u00e9dures en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le premier paragraphe de l\u2019art. 846 se lit comme suit:\n846. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure peut, \u00e0 la demande d\u2019une partie, \u00e9voquer avant jugement une affaire pendante devant un tribunal soumis \u00e0 son pouvoir de surveillance ou de contr\u00f4le, ou reviser le jugement d\u00e9j\u00e0 rendu par tel tribunal:\nCe qu\u2019il faut entendre par tribunal soumis \u00e0 son pouvoir de surveillance ou de contr\u00f4le appara\u00eet, dit-on, aux dispositions suivantes de l\u2019art. 33 C.P.C.\n33. A l\u2019exception de la Cour d\u2019appel, les tribunaux relevant de la comp\u00e9tence de la L\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec, ainsi que les corps politiques et les corporations dans la province, sont soumis au droit de surveillance et de r\u00e9forme de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, en la mani\u00e8re et dans la forme prescrites par la loi, sauf dans les mati\u00e8res que la loi d\u00e9clare \u00eatre du ressort exclusif de ces tribunaux, ou de l\u2019un quelconque de ceux-ci, et sauf dans les cas o\u00f9 la juridiction d\u00e9coulant du pr\u00e9sent article est exclue par quelque disposition d\u2019une loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ou particuli\u00e8re.\nD\u2019o\u00f9 l\u2019on conclut qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un tribunal relevant de la comp\u00e9tence de la L\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec et que tel n\u2019\u00e9tant pas le cas du Conseil canadien\u2014que le Parlement a cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la Loi sur les diff\u00e9rends du travail,\u2014les dispositions de l\u2019art. 846 C.P.C. ne peuvent s\u2019appliquer au Conseil canadien et offrir \u00e0 l\u2019appelante le moyen de se pourvoir contre l\u2019absence ou les exc\u00e8s de juridiction de ce tribunal administratif f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Il se peut, poursuit M. le juge Montgomery, que, en vertu d\u2019une loi d\u2019avant la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration ou en vertu du droit commun, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure ait retenu une certaine autorit\u00e9 pour restreindre un exc\u00e8s de juridiction de la part d\u2019un tribunal administratif f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, que ce soit au moyen de certiorari ou prohibition, recours remplac\u00e9s, pr\u00e9cise-t-il, par celui qu\u2019\u00e9tablit l\u2019art. 846 du nouveau Code. Toutefois, \u00e0 son avis, cette question ne saurait se pr\u00e9senter, vu que l\u2019appelante a choisi d\u2019exercer le recours \u00e9tabli au nouveau Code, recours inapplicable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pour les raisons ci-dessus indiqu\u00e9es. Enfin, le savant juge a not\u00e9 que, alors que le pr\u00e9sent appel \u00e9tait en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 devant la Cour d\u2019appel, un autre banc de cette Cour, compos\u00e9 de MM. les juges Taschereau, Owen et Choquette, avait jug\u00e9, dans une cause concernant le Conseil canadien, le m\u00eame Syndicat et Agence Maritime Inc., que le Conseil canadien n\u2019\u00e9tait pas soumis \u00e0 la juridiction de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019art. 846 C.P.C. et suivants. Dissident, M. le juge Choquette aurait rejet\u00e9 cet appel; il exprima l\u2019opinion que s\u2019il \u00e9tait vrai que l\u2019art. 33 et partant l\u2019art. 846 visent les tribunaux relevant de la comp\u00e9tence de la L\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec et que le Conseil canadien tire son existence d\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, le texte de ces articles ne prive pas la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle d\u00e9tient en vertu de sa loi organique et des pouvoirs inh\u00e9rents \u00e0 sa fonction. Et M. le juge Choquette ajouta que le bref d\u00e9livr\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019art. 846 et suivants vaut comme bref d\u2019assignation ordinaire et que, par sa requ\u00eate, Agence Maritime Inc. avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de d\u00e9clarer que la d\u00e9cision du Conseil canadien \u00e9tait nulle et de nul effet. Cet arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel dans Agence Maritime Inc. est pr\u00e9sentement l\u2019objet d\u2019un pourvoi devant notre Cour.\nAvec le plus grand respect, je dois dire que je ne puis partager la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle la Cour d\u2019appel en est arriv\u00e9e.\nAu jour o\u00f9 elle fut cr\u00e9\u00e9e en 1849, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure acquit en pl\u00e9nitude la juridiction civile de premi\u00e8re instance et particuli\u00e8rement la juridiction de surveillance jusqu\u2019alors exerc\u00e9e par la Cour du Banc du Roi, cf 12 Victoria, c. 38, art. VII. Au m\u00eame temps, on d\u00e9cr\u00e9ta que les brefs de pr\u00e9rogatives, aff\u00e9rents \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de cette juridiction de surveillance, \u00e9maneraient d\u00e9sormais de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, cf 12 Victoria, c. 41, art. XVI. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure devenait ainsi nantie du pouvoir de surveillance, bas\u00e9 sur la common law, qu\u2019exer\u00e7ait en Angleterre la Court of King\u2019s Bench sur laquelle la Cour du Banc du Roi fut model\u00e9e. Cette loi du contr\u00f4le judiciaire sur les tribunaux, corps politiques ou corporations exer\u00e7ant des pouvoirs judiciaires ou quasi judiciaires, nous vient du droit public anglais introduit au Qu\u00e9bec lors et par suite de la cession. On r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 cette juridiction de surveillance, que poss\u00e9dait en Angleterre la Court of B.R. (Banco Regis), dans la cause de Groenvelt v. Burwell[5]. Il s\u2019agissait du pourvoi d\u2019un m\u00e9decin contre une d\u00e9cision des Censeurs du Coll\u00e8ge des M\u00e9decins de Londres, le condamnant \u00e0 une amende et \u00e0 la prison. On objecta que le m\u00e9decin \u00e9tait sans rem\u00e8de, le statut ne pr\u00e9voyant pas de writ of error ou de certiorari. Le Juge en chef Holt d\u00e9clara:\nThat a certiorari lies, for no court can be intended exempt from the superintendency of the king in this court of B.R. (Banco Regis). It is a consequence of every inferior jurisdiction of record that their proceedings be removable into this court, to inspect the record and see whether they keep themselves within the limits of their jurisdiction\u2026\nEt on trouve au Qu\u00e9bec, avant 1849, une application de cette loi sur le contr\u00f4le judiciaire dans Hamilton v. Fraser[6], o\u00f9, dans une d\u00e9cision rendue en 1811, la Cour du Banc du Roi accueillit une demande de prohibition contre la Cour de Vice-Amiraut\u00e9 et dans King v. Gingras[7], o\u00f9, dans une d\u00e9cision rendue en 1833, la Cour provinciale des appels fit droit \u00e0 une demande de certiorari dirig\u00e9e contre les Commissaires charg\u00e9s de l\u2019\u00e9rection des \u00e9glises. \u00c9cartant de la consid\u00e9ration, pour l\u2019instant, les dispositions de l\u2019art. 33 du nouveau Code, dont il sera question ci-apr\u00e8s, on doit retenir que depuis 1849, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a toujours conserv\u00e9 et exerc\u00e9 cette juridiction, concurremment pour un temps seulement avec la Cour de Circuit. Quant \u00e0 la conservation de ce droit, on peut r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux arts. 1031 et 1220 du premier code de proc\u00e9dure civile, entr\u00e9 en vigueur avant la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration, soit le 28 juin 1867, aux arts. 1003 et ss. et 1292 et ss. du second code de proc\u00e9dure civile entr\u00e9 en vigueur le 1er septembre 1897 et \u00e0 l\u2019art. 846,\u2014qui sera ci\u2011apr\u00e8s consid\u00e9r\u00e9,\u2014du nouveau Code en vigueur depuis le 1er septembre 1966. Et quant \u00e0 l\u2019exercice de cette juridiction de surveillance \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de personnes ou organismes relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement et exer\u00e7ant des pouvoirs quasi judiciaires, on peut r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux d\u00e9cisions suivantes: Hon. G. Ouimet, Atty. Gen. v. Hon. J.H. Gray[8], cas d\u2019un arbitre nomm\u00e9 par le Gouvernement du Canada en vertu de l\u2019art. 142 de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord Britannique; The United Shoe Machinery Company of Canada v. The Hon. Charles Laurendeau et al.[9], cas d\u2019une commission si\u00e9geant en vertu de la Loi des enqu\u00eates sur les coalitions (1910) 9-10 Ed. VII, c 9; The Montreal Street Railway Co. v. The Board of Conciliation & Investigation et al.[10], cas d\u2019un conseil de conciliation et d\u2019enqu\u00eate nomm\u00e9 en vertu de la Loi des enqu\u00eates en mati\u00e8re de diff\u00e9rends industriels (1907) 6-7 Ed. VII, c. 20; Reid v. Charpentier et al.[11], cas d\u2019arbitres nomm\u00e9s en vertu de l\u2019art. 196 de l\u2019Acte des chemins de fer du Canada, 1906, S.R.C., c. 37 The Lachine, Jacques-Cartier & Maisonneuve Railway Co.[12], encore un cas d\u2019arbitres nomm\u00e9s en vertu de la m\u00eame loi des chemins de fer; Goulet v. Winters et al.[13], cas d\u2019une cour martiale si\u00e9geant en vertu de la Loi de la Milice, 1906 S.R.C., c. 41; Poulin v. Casgrain[14], cas d\u2019un juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure agissant, comme persona designata, en mati\u00e8re de contestation d\u2019\u00e9lection f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, 1927 S.R.C., c. 50; Stanley and others v. The Canada Labour Relations Board et al.[15], o\u00f9 r\u00e9f\u00e9rence est faite \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique dans Vantel Broadcasting Co. Ltd. v. Canada Labour Relations Board[16]. C\u2019est en 1957, par la loi 5-6 Elizabeth II, c. 15, art. 1, que la L\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec amenda l\u2019art. 50 C.P.C.,\u2014reproduit \u00e0 l\u2019art. 33 du nouveau Code,\u2014pour statuer express\u00e9ment que le droit de surveillance ou de r\u00e9forme de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure sur les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs serait limit\u00e9 aux tribunaux relevant de la comp\u00e9tence de la L\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec. Une l\u00e9gislature est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer dans les limites de sa comp\u00e9tence. La L\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence pour modifier et rien n\u2019indique qu\u2019elle ait entendu modifier, par cet amendement de 1957, l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de surveillance et contr\u00f4le que la Cour sup\u00e9rieure poss\u00e8de depuis avant la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration, tant en vertu de sa loi organique qu\u2019en vertu des pouvoirs inh\u00e9rents \u00e0 sa fonction, sur les organismes qui rel\u00e8vent maintenant de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement et qui exercent une action judiciaire ou quasi judiciaire dans les affaires de la province et rendent des d\u00e9cisions qui y sont ex\u00e9cutoires. Seul comp\u00e9tent pour ce faire, depuis 1867, cf. art. 129 de la Loi imp\u00e9riale, 30-31 Victoria, c. 3 , (Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord Britannique), le Parlement n\u2019a pas, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement du moins, attribu\u00e9, \u00e0 une autre cour, ce droit de contr\u00f4le et de surveillance. Il s\u2019ensuit que la Cour sup\u00e9rieure poss\u00e8de toujours cette autorit\u00e9 dont elle h\u00e9rita, par statut, de la Cour du Banc du Roi en 1849, de sorte que toute personne qui se pr\u00e9tend l\u00e9s\u00e9e dans ses droits, par suite d\u2019un exc\u00e8s de juridiction de la part d\u2019un organisme f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, peut, afin de les faire reconna\u00eetre et en assurer le respect, recourir \u00e0 cette autorit\u00e9. On reconna\u00eet d\u2019ailleurs aux dispositions de l\u2019art. 31 du nouveau Code de proc\u00e9dure civile que la Cour sup\u00e9rieure est le tribunal de droit commun et qu\u2019elle conna\u00eet en premi\u00e8re instance de toute demande qu\u2019une disposition formelle de la loi n\u2019a pas attribu\u00e9e exclusivement \u00e0 un autre tribunal. C\u2019est l\u00e0 un principe de droit public, bas\u00e9 sur la common law, qu\u2019on trouve exprim\u00e9 en ces termes par le Vicomte Haldane, \u00e0 la page 962, dans Board v. Board[17]:\nIf the right exists, the presumption is that there is a Court which can enforce it, for if no other mode of enforcing it is prescribed, that alone is sufficient to give jurisdiction to the King\u2019s Court of Justice. In order to oust this jurisdiction, it is necessary, in the absence of a special law excluding it altogether, to plead that jurisdiction exists in some other court.\nEt plus loin, \u00e0 la page 963, le savant juriste ajoute\u2026 nothing shall be intended to be out of the jurisdiction of a superior court but that which especially appears to be so. Dans les cas o\u00f9 le moyen d\u2019exercer un droit n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu, on peut, prescrit l\u2019art. 20 du nouveau Code, y sup- pl\u00e9er par toute proc\u00e9dure non incompatible avec les r\u00e8gles contenues dans ce Code ou avec quelque autre disposition de la loi. En fait et ainsi que le notent les r\u00e9dacteurs de ce nouveau Code, l\u2019art. 846 r\u00e9unit les dispositions des arts. 1003 et 1292 du Code pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, concernant respectivement la prohibition et le certiorari. Et les r\u00e9dacteurs pr\u00e9cisent que ces recours, \u00e0 cause de la connexit\u00e9 qui existe entre eux, au point que bien souvent la distinction \u00e9tait difficile \u00e0 \u00e9tablir, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fusionn\u00e9s pour n\u2019en former qu\u2019un seul. Ainsi donc, et nonobstant sa double fonction, le recours mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 846 n\u2019est pas nouveau. Diff\u00e9rent dans sa forme et non dans son essence, ce recours ne diff\u00e8re pas substantiellement des recours jusqu\u2019alors utilis\u00e9s pour se pourvoir, de fa\u00e7on sommaire et efficace, contre les exc\u00e8s de juridiction des tribunaux administratifs.\nJe dirais donc, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de M. le juge en chef Dorion, que la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a juridiction pour contr\u00f4ler l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une d\u00e9cision quasi judiciaire rendue par le Conseil canadien, lorsque cette ex\u00e9cution doit affecter les droits des justiciables de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et y \u00eatre effectu\u00e9e. En l\u2019absence de moyens prescrits pour faire appel \u00e0 ce pouvoir de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, les justiciables peuvent, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la disposition de l\u2019art. 20 C.P.C., recourir \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure applicable dans le cas des tribunaux administratifs relevant de la comp\u00e9tence de la L\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec.\nIl reste maintenant \u00e0 se demander si, prima facie, le Conseil canadien a exc\u00e9d\u00e9 sa juridiction en exer\u00e7ant, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le pouvoir d\u2019accr\u00e9ditation que lui conf\u00e8re la premi\u00e8re partie de la Loi sur les diff\u00e9rends du travail. Il nous faut donc rechercher si la premi\u00e8re partie de ce statut s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019appelante ou, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, si cette entreprise entre dans l\u2019une des cat\u00e9gories d\u2019entreprises mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019art. 53 de ce statut, dont il convient de citer les dispositions suivantes:\n53. La Partie I s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des travailleurs employ\u00e9s aux ouvrages, entreprises ou affaires qui rel\u00e8vent de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative du Parlement du Canada, ou relativement \u00e0 l\u2019exploitation de ces choses, y compris, mais non de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 restreindre la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de:\na) les ouvrages, entreprises ou affaires ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s ou exerc\u00e9s pour ou concernant la navigation et la marine marchande, int\u00e9rieures ou maritimes, y compris la mise en service de navires et le transport par navires partout au Canada; b) les chemins de fer, canaux, t\u00e9l\u00e9graphes et autres ouvrages et entreprises, reliant une province \u00e0 une ou plusieurs autres provinces, ou s\u2019\u00e9tendant au del\u00e0 des limites d\u2019une province;\nc) les lignes de vapeurs et autres navires reliant une province \u00e0 une ou plusieurs autres provinces, ou s\u2019\u00e9tendant au del\u00e0 des limites d\u2019une province;\nd) les bacs transbordeurs entre une province et une autre, ou entre une province et tout pays autre que le Canada;\ne) \u2026\nf) \u2026\ng) \u2026\nh) \u2026\net \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des patrons de ces travailleurs dans leurs rapports avec ces derniers, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des syndicats ouvriers et organisations patronales compos\u00e9s desdits travailleurs ou patrons.\nLes faits dont il faut tenir compte pour d\u00e9cider du caract\u00e8re juridique des op\u00e9rations de l\u2019appelante sont ceux qui sont all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans sa requ\u00eate et non ceux que le Conseil canadien a jug\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9s devant lui. Le Conseil ne saurait, en effet, s\u2019attribuer une juridiction en mal interpr\u00e9tant la preuve qu\u2019on lui a soumise et voil\u00e0 bien pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le fait qu\u2019on lui reproche \u00e0 la requ\u00eate et que nous devons pr\u00e9sumer, au moins pour l\u2019instant, au stade pr\u00e9liminaire o\u00f9 en est cette requ\u00eate, ainsi que le veut la disposition du second alin\u00e9a de l\u2019art. 847 C.P.C. Ainsi donc et tenant compte des faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s, nous devons retenir que, rationae loci, les op\u00e9rations maritimes de l\u2019appelante sont poursuivies dans le port de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res ou ses environs imm\u00e9diats sur le fleuve Saint-Laurent, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Quant \u00e0 la nature de ces op\u00e9rations, la requ\u00eate ne fait pas voir dans quelle mesure elles peuvent se rattacher \u00e0 du transport intra-provincial ou extra-provincial. Ce manque de pr\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9 par les juges de la Cour d\u2019appel ainsi qu\u2019il appert de l\u2019extrait suivant des motifs de jugement donn\u00e9s par M. le juge Montgomery, avec l\u2019accord de ses coll\u00e8gues:\nAll parties recognize that the leading case on this question is the reference to the Supreme Court regarding the validity of the Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act, commonly known as the Eastern Canada Stevedoring case, 1955, S.C.R. 529. In that case a majority of the Supreme Court held that the act applied to the relations between employees and a company that performed loading and unloading services entirely within the port of Toronto, because the employer\u2019s activities related to \u201cnavigation and shipping\u201d within the meaning of Section 91(10) of the British North America Act. On the face of it, this decision is favourable to the contentions of the Appellants, but Respondent maintains that it is distinguishable on the facts. When we turn to the facts of the present case, we find that they are not clearly set forth in the petition. Respondent does not admit that the findings of fact in the Board\u2019s judgment are correct but opposed Appellant\u2019s attempt to make evidence at the hearing of the petition. I am therefore of the opinion that we should not attempt to decide the merits of the question on the record as it stands.\nVu que la requ\u00eate fait voir que les op\u00e9rations de l\u2019appelante sont conduites \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res ou dans ses environs imm\u00e9diats mais qu\u2019elle ne fait pas voir que ses op\u00e9rations se rattachent \u00e0 du transport extra-provincial, le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9, \u00e0 ce stade pr\u00e9liminaire de la proc\u00e9dure, d\u2019accorder la d\u00e9livrance du bref d\u2019assignation.\nPour toutes ces raisons, j\u2019accueillerais l\u2019appel des jugements prononc\u00e9s, le 15 mai 1968, par la Cour du banc de la reine, dans les dossiers portant les num\u00e9ros 7076 et 7080 de ses dossiers, et je r\u00e9tablirais le dispositif du jugement de premi\u00e8re instance; le tout avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel accueilli avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelante: Langlois & Langlois, Qu\u00e9bec.\nProcureurs des intim\u00e9s, le Conseil, R.L.

La compagnie a alors appel\u00e9 \u00e0 cette Cour. Elle a invoqu\u00e9 le moyen retenu par le juge dissident en Cour d\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019en prenant la moyenne de la valeur \u00e9conomique, telle que rectifi\u00e9e par lui, et de la valeur de remplacement on obtient un montant de $3,050,000 mais qu\u2019un acheteur n\u2019accepterait pas de payer ce montant alors qu\u2019il peut obtenir un immeuble semblable mais vacant pour $2,500,000. D\u2019o\u00f9 la conclusion du juge qu\u2019il faudrait fixer la valeur r\u00e9elle \u00e0 $2,650,000.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLa valeur de remplacement est, tout comme la valeur \u00e9conomique, une estimation th\u00e9orique faite selon des crit\u00e8res adopt\u00e9s dans un but d\u2019uniformit\u00e9.

Cette valeur de remplacement ne peut donc pas \u00eatre \u00e9quitablement employ\u00e9e comme l\u2019a fait le juge dissident. Bien qu\u2019il y ait eu une erreur manifeste dans le jugement du Bureau de revision quant \u00e0 la superficie lou\u00e9e par \u00e9tage, cette erreur n\u2019a pas caus\u00e9 pr\u00e9judice parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas influ\u00e9 sur le calcul, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait correctement, de la valeur locative ayant servi \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la valeur \u00e9conomique.\nMunicipal corporations\u2014Municipal valuation of property\u2014Real value\u2014Economic value\u2014Replacement value\u2014Rental value\u2014City of Montreal Charter, 1959-60, 8-9 Eliz. II, c. 102.\nThe grounds advanced by the appellant company against the municipal valuation of $3,127,000 placed on its property were successively rejected by the Board of Revision, the Magistrate\u2019s Court and the Court of Appeal. It then appealed to this Court. The appellant invoked the ground advanced by the dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal that by taking the average between the economic value, as adjusted by him, and the replacement value a sum of $3,050,000 was obtained but that a buyer would not pay that price when he could have a similar building but vacant for $2,500,000. The judge then concluded that the real value should be fixed at $2,650,000.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe replacement value is, as well as the economic value, a theoretical estimate calculated according to criteria adopted for purposes of uniformity. That value does not mean that one could purchase a similar lot and build an identical building for that price. That is in evidence. Such replacement value could not equitably be used as the dissenting judge did.\nAlthough there was a manifest error as to the rented area on each floor, that error was not prejudicial as it did not influence the computation, which was correctly made, of the rental value which had served to determine the economic value.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec[1], affirming the municipal valuation of a property.

Echenberg, pour l\u2019appelante.\nRoger Pigeon, c.r., et Pierre Godbout, c.r., pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nLe jugement de la Cour fut rendu par\nLE JUGE PIGEON:\u2014Le litige a trait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation municipale d\u2019un immeuble. Les griefs de l\u2019appelante ont \u00e9t\u00e9 suc- cessivement rejet\u00e9s par le Bureau de revision, la Cour de magistrat et la Cour d\u2019appel[2]. Comme il s\u2019agit essentiellement d\u2019une question de fait, il est clair qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019intervenir \u00e0 moins d\u2019une erreur manifeste. De tous les moyens soumis par l\u2019appelante, deux seulement soul\u00e8vent une telle question.\nIl y a en premier lieu le moyen qui fait l\u2019objet de la dissidence du juge en chef de la Province. Apr\u00e8s avoir rectifi\u00e9 comme il lui para\u00eet \u00e0 propos de le faire la base du calcul de la \u00abvaleur \u00e9conomique\u00bb, il obtient en prenant la moyenne de cette valeur et de la \u00abvaleur de remplacement\u00bb un montant de $3,050,000, soit pratiquement le m\u00eame chiffre que l\u2019\u00e9valuation contest\u00e9e de $3,127,000 pour le r\u00f4le d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le 1er d\u00e9cembre 1955 et sensiblement plus que l\u2019\u00e9valuation port\u00e9e au r\u00f4le ant\u00e9rieur. Cependant, il dit ensuite:\nM\u00eame en tenant compte des baux existants, je ne crois pas qu\u2019 \u00abun acheteur qui n\u2019est pas oblig\u00e9 d\u2019acheter, mais qui d\u00e9sire acheter\u00bb accepte de payer $3,050,000 pour un immeuble alors qu\u2019il peut en obtenir un semblable mais vacant pour $2,500,000.\nEt il conclut que pour rendre justice aux parties, il faudrait fixer la valeur r\u00e9elle \u00e0 $2,650,000.\nA l\u2019encontre de ce raisonnement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait valoir que la valeur de remplacement fix\u00e9e au chiffre ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9 est, tout comme la valeur \u00e9conomique, une estimation th\u00e9orique faite selon des crit\u00e8res adopt\u00e9s dans un but d\u2019uniformit\u00e9. Elle ne signifie pas que l\u2019on puisse acheter un terrain semblable et construire un immeuble identique \u00e0 ce prix. Au contraire, on a la preuve au dossier qu\u2019alors que dans cette \u00abvaleur de remplacement\u00bb le terrain est estim\u00e9 \u00e0 $86,900, c\u2019est $350,000 que l\u2019appelante a d\u00e9bours\u00e9 pour s\u2019en porter acqu\u00e9reur. Quant au b\u00e2timent, il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il aurait fallu en 1955 d\u00e9bourser plus que les $2,500,000 pour le reconstruire. Il faut donc dire que la \u00abvaleur de remplacement\u00bb comme elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie ne peut pas \u00e9quitablement servir de base au raisonnement ci-dessus relat\u00e9 lequel suppose qu\u2019il s\u2019agit vraiment du prix courant.\nLe second moyen d\u00e9coule d\u2019une erreur incontestable dans le long jugement du Bureau de revision. On y a dit que la superficie lou\u00e9e par \u00e9tage \u00e9tait de 14,810 p.c. alors que les baux d\u00e9montrent 13,810 p.c. En \u00e9tudiant la d\u00e9cision on se rend compte, cependant, que cette erreur n\u2019a pas caus\u00e9 pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019appelante parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas influ\u00e9 sur le calcul de la valeur locative servant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la \u00abvaleur \u00e9conomique\u00bb. Ce calcul a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait correctement. C\u2019est seulement en critiquant la m\u00e9thode de calcul propos\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante que l\u2019on s\u2019est servi du chiffre inexact pour en d\u00e9duire que la superficie non comprise dans les baux \u00e0 chaque \u00e9tage repr\u00e9sente 7.5 pour-cent de la superficie totale. Si l\u2019on avait employ\u00e9 le chiffre exact, on aurait trouv\u00e9 13.6 pour-cent. Vu que ce calcul avait pour seul objet de d\u00e9montrer que le chiffre de 25 pour-cent propos\u00e9 par l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait excessif, la conclusion aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 la m\u00eame sans l\u2019erreur, l\u2019\u00e9cart demeurant encore tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ciable.\nJe suis d\u2019avis de rejeter l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelante: Chait, Aronovitch, Salomon, Gelber, Reis & Bronstein, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9e: Pag\u00e9, Mercier & Beauregard, Montr\u00e9al.\n[1] [1968] B.R. 277.\n[2] [1968] B.R. 277.",

Dans l\u2019action, qu\u2019il a intent\u00e9e en d\u00e9cembre 1960, le demandeur a assign\u00e9 l\u2019institution hospitali\u00e8re et le m\u00e9decin responsable du service d\u2019anesth\u00e9sie. Par la suite, le 25 avril 1962, le demandeur apprit que l\u2019anesth\u00e9sie avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pratiqu\u00e9e par un autre m\u00e9decin et, avec l\u2019autorisation du tribunal, il a modifi\u00e9 sa poursuite et assign\u00e9 le v\u00e9ritable anesth\u00e9siste. Le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance a statu\u00e9 que l\u2019h\u00f4pital et l\u2019anesth\u00e9siste \u00e9taient solidairement responsables.\nLa Cour d\u2019appel, par un jugement majoritaire, a infirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision rendue contre l\u2019h\u00f4pital et a retenu celle contre le m\u00e9decin anesth\u00e9siste. Le juge dissident aurait annul\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision contre l\u2019anesth\u00e9siste seulement en se fondant sur les dispositions relatives \u00e0 la prescription d\u2019un an pour \u00abl\u00e9sions ou blessures corporelles\u00bb. Le demandeur et le m\u00e9decin anesth\u00e9siste ont interjet\u00e9 appel de cette d\u00e9cision.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel du demandeur contre l\u2019institution hospitali\u00e8re doit \u00eatre accueilli et l\u2019appel du m\u00e9decin anesth\u00e9siste rejet\u00e9.\nQuand une personne subit un pr\u00e9judice par suite d\u2019un \u00e9v\u00e9nement ou d\u2019une initiative qui normalement n\u2019aurait pas eu ce r\u00e9sultat et qu\u2019on peut conclure en toute probabilit\u00e9 que la chose ne se serait pas produite en l\u2019absence de faute, il existe une pr\u00e9somption de fait (art. 1238 et 1242 C.C.) qui conclut \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 de celui qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage. Comme on ne peut pas, en mati\u00e8re civile, exiger un degr\u00e9 de certitude autre que celui d\u2019une probabilit\u00e9 raisonnable, la pr\u00e9somption ci-dessus s\u2019applique au m\u00e9decin anesth\u00e9siste.\nOn doit conclure \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle de l\u2019h\u00f4pital du fait que l\u2019anesth\u00e9siste dont le choix n\u2019\u00e9tait pas laiss\u00e9 au patient, et qui ne pouvait pour cette raison \u00eatre son mandataire, \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 salari\u00e9 de l\u2019h\u00f4pital faisant partie d\u2019un service qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, juridiquement distinct des autres services de cette institution.\nNegligence\u2014Physicians\u2019 liability\u2014Presumption of fact arising under art. 1242 of the Civil Code\u2014Whether the physician was a servant of the hospital\u2014Interruption of prescription by court action as against another joint and several debtor\u2014Civil Code, art. 1054, 1238, 1242, 2231, 2262.\nPrior to a minor surgery, which he underwent on January 11, 1960, in the H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Chicoutimi, a spinal anaesthesia was administered to the plaintiff following which his lower limbs were paralyzed. In an action he initiated in December 1960, the plaintiff sued both the hospital and the physician in charge of the department of anaesthesia. At a later date, on April 22, 1962, the plaintiff was informed that the anaesthesia had been performed by another doctor and, with the Court\u2019s permission, he amended his claim to join in the action the proper person. The Court found that the hospital and the anaesthetist were jointly liable. The Court of Appeal, by a majority, allowed the appeal as regards the hospital but maintained the decision of the Superior Court against the anaesthetist. The dissenting judge would have allowed the anaesthetist\u2019s appeal on the basis of that article of the Civil Code which provides for a one\u2011year time limitation for claims arising out of \u201cbodily injuries\u201d. Both the plaintiff and the anaesthetist appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The plaintiff\u2019s appeal as against the hospital should be allowed and the anaesthetist\u2019s appeal dismissed.\nIf damage is caused to someone by reason of an event or operation which normally would not have such a result and if it can further be shown that, in all probability, it would not have happened that way in the absence of a fault, there is a presumption of fact (art. 1238 and 1242 C.C.) as against the person who has caused the damage. Inasmuch as in civil matters no higher degree of certainty than a reasonable probability can be required, the presumption above applies to the anaesthetist.\nThe hospital\u2019s liability is based on the fact that the anaesthetist, who was not the patient\u2019s choice and who, for this reason, was not his agent, was a salaried employee of the hospital and a staff member of a department that was not, at the time, a separate legal entity.\nAPPEALS from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], reversing in part a judgment of Miquelon J.

Toutefois, \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate, il a admis que les signes observ\u00e9s d\u00e9montraient l\u2019existence d\u2019une l\u00e9sion au niveau de la moelle \u00e9pini\u00e8re appuyant ainsi l\u2019opinion du docteur Lionel Lemieux, expert en neurologie, \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il y avait des indices certains d\u2019atteinte de la moelle.\nMalgr\u00e9 tous les traitements, le demandeur est rest\u00e9 invalide. On a m\u00eame constat\u00e9 lors de l\u2019enqu\u00eate en 1964 que son degr\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 \u00e9tait plus prononc\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de septembre 1960, et ne pourrait que s\u2019aggraver davantage.\nSaisie d\u2019une poursuite contre l\u2019h\u00f4pital et l\u2019anesth\u00e9siste, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure (Paul Miquelon J.) les a condamn\u00e9s solidairement \u00e0 payer une indemnit\u00e9 de $58,216.33.\nEn Cour d\u2019appel la majorit\u00e9 (Brossard et Salvas JJ.) a infirm\u00e9 la condamnation contre l\u2019h\u00f4pital. Taschereau J. dissident, aurait au contraire annul\u00e9 la condamnation contre l\u2019anesth\u00e9siste.\nA l\u2019encontre de cet arr\u00eat, les deux parties se sont pourvues devant nous, le demandeur pour faire r\u00e9tablir la condamnation prononc\u00e9e contre l\u2019h\u00f4pital, l\u2019anesth\u00e9siste pour faire annuler la sienne.\nDisons d\u2019abord en ce qui concerne la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019anesth\u00e9siste, qu\u2019il y a sur l\u2019existence d\u2019une faute pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e contre lui identit\u00e9 d\u2019opinion entre le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et tous ceux de la Cour d\u2019Appel. Ceux de la majorit\u00e9 ont conclu \u00e0 l\u2019irresponsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019h\u00f4pital uniquement parce qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas voulu admettre que l\u2019anesth\u00e9siste devait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de l\u2019h\u00f4pital. Quant au dissident, c\u2019est seulement pour cause de prescription qu\u2019il aurait rejet\u00e9 la poursuite contre l\u2019anesth\u00e9siste.\nEnsuite, il faut noter que les d\u00e9fendeurs ont admis au proc\u00e8s que le pr\u00e9judice subi par le demandeur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par l\u2019anesth\u00e9sie caudale qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 administr\u00e9e. Ils contestent cependant le bien-fond\u00e9 de la conclusion que l\u2019on en a tir\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une faute dans l\u2019administration de l\u2019anesth\u00e9sie. Le principe sur lequel on s\u2019est fond\u00e9 pour conclure ainsi a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 comme suit par le juge Taschereau (avant de devenir juge en chef) dans un arr\u00eat sans dissidence de cette Cour, Parent c. Lapointe[3]:\nQuand, dans le cours normal des choses, un \u00e9v\u00e9nement ne doit pas se produire, mais arrive tout de m\u00eame, et cause un dommage \u00e0 autrui, et quand il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019il ne serait pas arriv\u00e9 s\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu de n\u00e9gligence, alors, c\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019auteur de ce fait \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il y a une cause \u00e9trang\u00e8re, dont il ne peut \u00eatre tenu responsable et qui est la source de ce dommage. Si celui qui avait le contr\u00f4le de la chose r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 \u00e9tablir \u00e0 la satisfaction de la Cour, l\u2019existence du fait extrins\u00e8que, il aura droit au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019exon\u00e9ration.\nCes phrases \u00e9crites dans une affaire d\u2019accident d\u2019automobile ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9es applicables \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 m\u00e9dicale: Cardin c. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[4], un arr\u00eat unanime de cette Cour. C\u2019est \u00e0 bon droit que les tribunaux du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 l\u2019instar de ceux des autres provinces et de Grande\u2011Bretagne ont depuis assez longtemps rejet\u00e9 une certaine th\u00e9orie d\u2019apr\u00e8s laquelle en mati\u00e8re de responsabilit\u00e9 m\u00e9dicale, une preuve directe de la faute aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire. Les textes qui admettent la preuve par pr\u00e9somption de fait (art. 1238, 1242, C.C.) ne font aucune distinction et il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019en introduire arbitrairement.\nIl faut donc uniquement rechercher si la preuve faite \u00e9tait suffisante pour permettre de conclure qu\u2019en toute probabilit\u00e9 ce qui s\u2019est produit ne serait pas arriv\u00e9 en l\u2019absence de faute. Je dis \u00aben toute probabilit\u00e9\u00bb car il est clair que lorsque dans le texte ci-dessus cit\u00e9 le juge Taschereau dit \u00abil est \u00e9vident\u00bb, il n\u2019entend pas exiger un degr\u00e9 de certitude autre que celui qui doit servir \u00e0 juger les causes civiles, soit une probabilit\u00e9 raisonnable. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une certitude hors de tout doute raisonnable qui est exig\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re criminelle seulement. Encore moins peut-on exiger une certitude math\u00e9matique, une d\u00e9monstration qui exclut toute autre probabilit\u00e9. Dans Montreal Tramways c. L\u00e9veill\u00e9[5], cette Cour a admis une pr\u00e9somption de fait comme preuve suffisante de la relation de cause \u00e0 effet entre une chute faite par une femme enceinte et la difformit\u00e9 de son enfant.\nIci, il y a s\u00fbrement une preuve suffisante pour d\u00e9montrer que la paralysie ne devait pas normalement se produire comme cons\u00e9quence d\u2019une anesth\u00e9sie caudale bien administr\u00e9e. Le docteur Comtois, chef du service d\u2019anesth\u00e9sie de l\u2019h\u00f4pital, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019on y avait pratiqu\u00e9 plus de 10,000 anesth\u00e9sies de ce genre sans qu\u2019un pareil r\u00e9sultat se produise. Quant au t\u00e9moin expert de la d\u00e9fense en mati\u00e8re d\u2019anesth\u00e9sie, le Docteur Dubeau, il a parl\u00e9 d\u2019un seul autre cas sans d\u2019aucune mani\u00e8re affirmer qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un accident in\u00e9vitable. Certains anesth\u00e9sistes ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 leur avis il \u00e9tait possible qu\u2019une sensibilit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019anesth\u00e9sique employ\u00e9, la \u00abxiloca\u00efne\u00bb additionn\u00e9e d\u2019adr\u00e9naline, ait caus\u00e9 l\u2019inflammation grave qui s\u2019est produite, mais d\u2019autres l\u2019ont ni\u00e9 cat\u00e9goriquement, et parmi ces derniers on trouve le chef du service d\u2019anesth\u00e9sie de l\u2019h\u00f4pital, le docteur Comtois. Apr\u00e8s avoir mentionn\u00e9 diverses r\u00e9actions possibles telles qu\u2019une chute de pression, il a dit:\nAlors \u00e7a, ce sont des choses qu\u2019on rencontre assez souvent, mais de l\u00e0 \u00e0 avoir des parapl\u00e9gies, et des paralysies, non.\nIl faut dire que la seule explication sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e par la d\u00e9fense pour expliquer l\u2019accident en excluant une faute, savoir une susceptibilit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019anesth\u00e9sique utilis\u00e9, est une pure hypoth\u00e8se qui n\u2019est aucunement d\u00e9montr\u00e9e et que la preuve tend fortement \u00e0 exclure. Au reste, tous les t\u00e9moignages m\u00e9dicaux sont unanimes \u00e0 constater l\u2019absence de toute contre\u2011indication pour le genre d\u2019anesth\u00e9sie employ\u00e9e.\nIl faut maintenant observer que l\u2019on n\u2019a aucunement d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour d\u2019appel avaient fait erreur en jugeant que la pr\u00e9somption n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 repouss\u00e9e. Il est bien vrai que l\u2019anesth\u00e9siste a jur\u00e9 \u00eatre certain d\u2019avoir fait correctement l\u2019injection de l\u2019anesth\u00e9sique et d\u2019avoir bien v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 en lisant l\u2019\u00e9tiquette sur les deux fioles qu\u2019il avait inject\u00e9 la solution voulue. Cela ne suffisait pas pour obliger le tribunal \u00e0 conclure \u00e0 l\u2019absence de faute surtout lorsque l\u2019accident n\u2019\u00e9tait pas expliqu\u00e9. Dans Parent c. Lapointe, le conducteur de l\u2019automobile avait bien jur\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait aucunement senti venir le sommeil. On a cependant refus\u00e9 de le croire et on l\u2019a jug\u00e9 coupable d\u2019avoir commis la faute de conduire une automobile alors qu\u2019il avait sommeil.\nIci, pour justifier le tribunal de ne pas accepter l\u2019affirmation de l\u2019anesth\u00e9siste, il y a plus que le r\u00e9sultat inexpliqu\u00e9 de l\u2019injection. Il y a \u00e9galement le fait que son t\u00e9moignage malgr\u00e9 sa sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas convaincant parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a aucun souvenir pr\u00e9cis de ce cas particulier. Ce n\u2019est pas parce qu\u2019il se souvient exactement de ce qu\u2019il a fait qu\u2019il affirme ne pas avoir commis d\u2019erreur mais uniquement parce qu\u2019il est convaincu d\u2019avoir fait comme il fait toujours. Il se souvient si peu de ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 que jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019on lui montre que l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re en charge de la salle de r\u00e9veil y avait not\u00e9 une visite de sa part, il affirme ne pas y avoir \u00e9t\u00e9. A cela, il faut ajouter que la technique d\u00e9crite par l\u2019anesth\u00e9siste et qui consiste \u00e0 m\u00e9langer dans un petit bocal deux solutions d\u2019anesth\u00e9sique dont une seule devait renfermer de l\u2019adr\u00e9naline, ne permet aucunement d\u2019exclure l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se de toutes sortes d\u2019erreurs conciliables avec les effets observ\u00e9s.\nIl faut maintenant rechercher si la majorit\u00e9 en Cour d\u2019appel a eu raison de statuer que \u00able contrat conclu entre l\u2019h\u00f4pital et le docteur Vigneault n\u2019a pas cr\u00e9\u00e9 entre eux les liens de pr\u00e9position de ma\u00eetre \u00e0 domestique ou de mandant \u00e0 mandataire envisag\u00e9s par le dernier alin\u00e9a de l\u2019article 1054 C.C. ou par les articles 1720 et 1731 C.C.\u00bb. Le juge Brossard dit \u00e0 ce sujet:\nAvec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour les opinions contraires, il ne m\u2019est pas possible, m\u00eame de faire un rapprochement, juridiquement ou autrement, entre le contrat qui intervient entre une institution d\u2019hospitalisation et le malade qu\u2019elle re\u00e7oit et le contrat d\u2019entreprise auquel sont parties des entrepreneurs en travaux de plomberie ou d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 ou en enl\u00e8vement de vidanges, ni surtout d\u2019assimiler juridiquement le contrat qui intervient entre une institution hospitali\u00e8re et un m\u00e9decin au contrat de travail liant les entrepreneurs susdits \u00e0 un plombier, un \u00e9lectricien ou un boueur; sans transformer l\u2019obligation n\u00e9e du premier contrat en obligation de r\u00e9sultat ou modifier celle n\u00e9e du second contrat en obligation de moyens.\nAvec respect, ce raisonnement me para\u00eet aller \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la d\u00e9cision unanime rendue dans Cardin c. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al[6]. Depuis l\u2019arr\u00eat de cette Cour dans S\u0153urs de St-Joseph c. Fleming[7], personne ne soutient que les techniciens, infirmi\u00e8res et infirmiers ne doivent pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s. Il est cependant indubitable qu\u2019ils sont susceptibles de commettre des fautes professionnelles dans l\u2019administration de traitements ou autres soins m\u00e9dicaux. Nul ne pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019on impose \u00e0 un h\u00f4pital une obligation de r\u00e9sultat en le tenant pour responsable du pr\u00e9judice d\u00e9coulant de fautes commises par eux dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de leurs fonctions. En effet, leur responsabilit\u00e9 s\u2019appr\u00e9cie d\u2019apr\u00e8s le m\u00eame crit\u00e8re que celle des m\u00e9decins, on ne les juge pas en faute du seul fait qu\u2019un traitement ne procure pas la gu\u00e9rison. Cependant, lorsqu\u2019il y a lieu de le faire, on leur applique comme aux m\u00e9decins la pr\u00e9somption que la Cour d\u2019appel est unanime \u00e0 admettre contre ces derniers. Puisque l\u2019on rejette \u00e0 bon droit une th\u00e9orie de la responsabilit\u00e9 m\u00e9dicale impliquant une r\u00e8gle de preuve autre que le principe ordinaire acceptant les pr\u00e9somptions de fait, je ne vois pas comment on peut consid\u00e9rer que l\u2019application aux m\u00e9decins de la r\u00e8gle ordinaire sur la relation de pr\u00e9position est inconciliable avec une conception exacte de la responsabilit\u00e9 dont il s\u2019agit.\nIci, l\u2019anesth\u00e9siste \u00e9tait l\u2019employ\u00e9 salari\u00e9 de l\u2019h\u00f4pital En outre de son salaire \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9sident en anesth\u00e9sie, il recevait un montant mensuel fixe pr\u00e9lev\u00e9 sur les honoraires per\u00e7us par l\u2019h\u00f4pital comme frais d\u2019anesth\u00e9sie charg\u00e9s aux patients. Le demandeur n\u2019a eu rien \u00e0 voir dans le choix de son anesth\u00e9siste. Celui-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le chef du service d\u2019anesth\u00e9sie de l\u2019h\u00f4pital. On ne saurait pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019il soit ensuite pass\u00e9 sous la direction du chirurgien car l\u2019anesth\u00e9sie \u00e9tait faite quand celui-ci est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la salle d\u2019op\u00e9ration. De plus, il faut souligner que le service d\u2019anesth\u00e9sie \u00e9tait \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 un service de l\u2019h\u00f4pital et non une entreprise distincte. Certains t\u00e9moins ont pr\u00e9tendu que le patient avait toujours le droit de choisir son anesth\u00e9siste. Consid\u00e9rant l\u2019ensemble de la preuve sur ce point, la seule conclusion possible c\u2019est qu\u2019il pouvait \u00eatre apport\u00e9 des exceptions \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle d\u2019apr\u00e8s laquelle l\u2019anesth\u00e9sie \u00e9tait pratiqu\u00e9e par un m\u00e9decin du service d\u2019anesth\u00e9sie d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le chef de ce service.\nOn a fait \u00e9tat d\u2019un document sign\u00e9 par le demandeur lors de son entr\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital et qui se lit comme suit:\nPar la pr\u00e9sente j\u2019autorise le m\u00e9decin ou les m\u00e9decins en charge du soin de M. Charles\u2011Eug\u00e8ne Martel, \u00e0 administrer tout traitement ou \u00e0 administrer tels\nNom du patient.\nanesth\u00e9siques et \u00e0 accomplir telles op\u00e9rations jug\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires ou recommandables dans le diagnostic, et le traitement de ce patient.\nOn ne saurait voir l\u00e0 autre chose qu\u2019un consentement aux interventions. Il ne s\u2019y trouve rien qui modifie la nature juridique du contrat entre le demandeur et l\u2019h\u00f4pital. Celui-ci est clairement une convention par laquelle l\u2019\u00e9tablissement s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 fournir des soins au demandeur. C\u2019est en ex\u00e9cution de ce contrat que l\u2019anesth\u00e9sie a \u00e9t\u00e9 pratiqu\u00e9e sans qu\u2019intervienne aucune relation contractuelle entre l\u2019anesth\u00e9siste et le demandeur: ni lui, ni son m\u00e9decin traitant, ni son chirurgien n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9s \u00e0 ce sujet. L\u2019anesth\u00e9siste en l\u2019occurrence a donn\u00e9 ses soins comme l\u2019y obligeait son contrat d\u2019emploi avec l\u2019h\u00f4pital et comme l\u2019ont fait les autres membres du personnel: radiologistes, techniciens de laboratoire, infirmi\u00e8res, infirmiers, etc. Sa qualit\u00e9 de m\u00e9decin sp\u00e9cialiste n\u2019y change rien. Il serait contraire aux faits prouv\u00e9s que de consid\u00e9rer l\u2019h\u00f4pital comme un mandataire ayant requis pour le compte du demandeur les services professionnels de l\u2019anesth\u00e9siste. Ce n\u2019est pas ce qui s\u2019est produit.\nLe pr\u00e9judice subi par le demandeur ayant donc \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par une faute pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e de l\u2019anesth\u00e9siste au cours de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 par l\u2019h\u00f4pital, il faut conclure \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle de l\u2019institution.\nCette conclusion suffit \u00e0 disposer du plaidoyer de prescription invoqu\u00e9 par l\u2019anesth\u00e9siste. Quand le demandeur a intent\u00e9 son action en d\u00e9cembre 1960, il croyait que c\u2019\u00e9tait le docteur Gaston Comtois qui avait pratiqu\u00e9 l\u2019anesth\u00e9sie. En effet, le rapport d\u2019anesth\u00e9sie porte sur la derni\u00e8re ligne en regard du mot \u00abAnesth\u00e9siste\u00bb la signature suivante: \u00abVigneault Comtois\u00bb. Il a donc dirig\u00e9 sa poursuite contre l\u2019h\u00f4pital et le docteur Comtois et ce n\u2019est qu\u2019au cours d\u2019un interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable de ce dernier, le 25 avril 1962, qu\u2019il a appris que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas lui qui l\u2019avait anesth\u00e9si\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s cette r\u00e9v\u00e9lation inattendue, le demandeur s\u2019est d\u00e9sist\u00e9 de sa poursuite contre le docteur Comtois et, avec l\u2019autorisation du tribunal, il l\u2019a amend\u00e9e pour assigner comme d\u00e9fendeur solidaire avec l\u2019h\u00f4pital le v\u00e9ritable anesth\u00e9siste, le docteur Vigneault. Si la demande n\u2019\u00e9tait pas accueillie contre l\u2019h\u00f4pital, il faudrait rechercher si la prescription d\u2019un an \u00abpour l\u00e9sions ou blessures corporelles\u00bb devrait \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agirait d\u2019une responsabilit\u00e9 contractuelle ou parce qu\u2019il y aurait eu impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019agir. Mais vu que l\u2019on doit conclure \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019h\u00f4pital, il me semble \u00e9vident que la prescription interrompue par la signification de l\u2019action \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement interrompue contre l\u2019anesth\u00e9siste, art. 2231 C.C., premier alin\u00e9a:\n2231. Tout acte qui interrompt la prescription contre l\u2019un des d\u00e9biteurs solidaires, l\u2019interrompt contre tous.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s une jurisprudence bien \u00e9tablie, il y a solidarit\u00e9 entre tous les responsables d\u2019un m\u00eame dommage d\u00e9lictuel ou quasi-d\u00e9lictuel. Dans The Grand Trunk Railway et la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al c. McDonald,[8] cette Cour a statu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9 qu\u2019il y a solidarit\u00e9 entre deux employeurs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019obligation d\u00e9coulant des fautes distinctes commises par leurs pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s respectifs et ayant caus\u00e9 le pr\u00e9judice. Vu qu\u2019en l\u2019occurrence, il fallait pour justifier la condamnation contre le second employeur, la municipalit\u00e9, statuer que la prescription avait \u00e9t\u00e9 interrompue par la poursuite contre le premier, la conclusion \u00e0 l\u2019existence de la solidarit\u00e9 est un motif essentiel de l\u2019arr\u00eat. Il va de soi que si l\u2019on reconna\u00eet la solidarit\u00e9 entre deux commettants pour un dommage d\u00e9coulant de la faute commune de leurs pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s, \u00e0 plus forte raison faut-il l\u2019admettre entre le commettant et le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9. Parmi les nombreux arr\u00eats en ce sens on peut citer: Beaubien c. Laframboise[9], Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al c. Beauvais[10].\nJe ne puis cependant m\u00e9conna\u00eetre la difficult\u00e9 qui est signal\u00e9e par les juges Taschereau et Fauteux dans Modern Motor Sales Ltd. c. Masoud[11], et qui d\u00e9coule de l\u2019art. 1106 C.C. Ce texte ajout\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9daction du titre des obligations se lit comme suit:\n1106. L\u2019obligation r\u00e9sultant d\u2019un d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit commis par deux personnes ou plus est solidaire.\n1106. The obligation arising from the common offence or quasi-offence of two or more persons is joint and several.\nOn ne saurait nier qu\u2019\u00e0 proprement dire le commettant est responsable du d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit commis par son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions sans l\u2019avoir commis lui-m\u00eame. D\u2019apr\u00e8s les dictionnaires, le d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit c\u2019est le fait fautif, non la responsabilit\u00e9 qui en d\u00e9coule.\nA ce sujet il faut observer que dans l\u2019affaire McDonald le juge en chef et le juge Brodeur, les seuls \u00e0 \u00e9tudier la question de solidarit\u00e9, se sont largement appuy\u00e9s sur la jurisprudence de la Cour de Cassation, Or, au Code Napol\u00e9on, apr\u00e8s les art. 1200, 1201 et 1202 correspondant substantiellement aux art. 1103, 1104 et 1105 C.C. (sauf le dernier alin\u00e9a), on ne trouve aucune disposition analogue \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1106. Au Code p\u00e9nal, l\u2019art. 55 vise seulement \u00ables individus condamn\u00e9s pour un m\u00eame crime ou un m\u00eame d\u00e9lit\u00bb. En France, on ne peut donc se fonder que sur l\u2019art. 1200 C.N. pour conclure \u00e0 la solidarit\u00e9 entre personnes civilement responsables d\u2019un m\u00eame dommage. C\u2019est bien ce que d\u00e9cidait autrefois la Cour de Cassation, ainsi dans un arr\u00eat du 17 mars 1902 (Hayem et comp. c. Nico D.P. 1902, 1, 541), on lit:\nAttendu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait constant et reconnu par toutes les parties, que Nico et Christmann se trouvaient oblig\u00e9s, envers Hayem et comp., \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration int\u00e9grale du pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9sultant pour ces derniers de quasi-d\u00e9lits auxquels tous deux avaient particip\u00e9, de mani\u00e8re que chacun des d\u00e9biteurs pouvait y \u00eatre contraint pour la totalit\u00e9, et que le payement, fait par un seul aurait eu pour effet de lib\u00e9rer l\u2019autre;\u2014Attendu que ces conditions, qui sont celles d\u00e9terminant, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019art. 1200 c. civ., l\u2019existence de la solidarit\u00e9 entre les d\u00e9biteurs, leur rendaient applicable l\u2019art. 1285 c. civ., d\u2019apr\u00e8s lequel la remise ou d\u00e9charge conventionnelle au profit de l\u2019un des cod\u00e9biteurs solidaires lib\u00e8re tous les autres, \u00e0 moins que le cr\u00e9ancier n\u2019ait express\u00e9ment r\u00e9serv\u00e9 ses droits contre ces derniers;\nInvariablement, l\u2019objection \u00e0 la solidarit\u00e9 dans des cas semblables a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019art. 1202 C.N., qui correspond aux deux premiers alin\u00e9as de l\u2019art. 1105 C.C. Quoique le Code d\u00e9cr\u00e8te \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1200: \u00abIl y a solidarit\u00e9 de la part des d\u00e9biteurs, lorsqu\u2019ils sont oblig\u00e9s \u00e0 une m\u00eame chose, de mani\u00e8re que chacun puisse \u00eatre contraint pour la totalit\u00e9, et que le payement fait par un seul lib\u00e8re les autres envers le cr\u00e9ancier\u00bb, on soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019y a qu\u2019une obligation in solidum si la loi ou la convention ne l\u2019a pas qualifi\u00e9e \u00absolidaire\u00bb et cela parce qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019art. 1202 on dit ensuite: \u00abLa solidarit\u00e9 ne se pr\u00e9sume point; il faut qu\u2019elle soit express\u00e9ment stipul\u00e9e. Cette r\u00e8gle ne cesse que dans les cas o\u00f9 la solidarit\u00e9 a lieu de plein droit, en vertu d\u2019une disposition de la loi\u00bb. Cette mani\u00e8re de voir sur laquelle les auteurs sont divis\u00e9s, semble pr\u00e9valoir actuellement en jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise. Les juges Bissonnette et Rinfret y ont fait \u00e9cho dans Blumberg c. Wawanesa Mutual Ins. Co.[12] sans que ce motif soit retenu par une majorit\u00e9. Cette Cour[13] a confirm\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat sans se prononcer sur cette question. C\u2019est aussi ce qu\u2019il semble \u00e0 propos de faire dans le cas pr\u00e9sent. Comme il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019une obligation quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider si la solidarit\u00e9 d\u00e9coule de l\u2019art. 1103 ou de l\u2019art. 1106 du Code civil\nIl convient d\u2019observer qu\u2019il n\u2019est aucunement contraire \u00e0 la notion de solidarit\u00e9 que de consid\u00e9rer solidaires \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du cr\u00e9ancier deux d\u00e9biteurs dont l\u2019un est, envers l\u2019autre, responsable du tout. Cette \u00e9ventualit\u00e9 est pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1120.\n1120. Si l\u2019affaire pour laquelle la dette a \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e solidairement ne concerne que l\u2019un des cod\u00e9biteurs, celui-ci est tenu de toute la dette vis-\u00e0-vis des autres cod\u00e9biteurs, qui ne sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s par rapport \u00e0 lui que comme ses cautions.\nLe fait que dans la poursuite \u00e0 l\u2019origine on ait mentionn\u00e9 le docteur Comtois et non le docteur Vigneault comme cod\u00e9- biteur ne saurait emp\u00eacher l\u2019effet interruptif de la demande. L\u2019amendement apport\u00e9 ult\u00e9rieurement est admis par la jurisprudence: Lefaivre c. Fontaine[14]. De toute fa\u00e7on, la demande initiale \u00e9tait suffisamment libell\u00e9e contre l\u2019h\u00f4pital en all\u00e9guant le fait cause du dommage, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019erreur dans le nom de l\u2019auteur et il faut appliquer le second alin\u00e9a de l\u2019art. 2224 C.C.:\nCette interruption se continue jusqu\u2019au jugement d\u00e9finitif et elle vaut pour tout droit et recours r\u00e9sultant de la m\u00eame source que la demande.\nPour ces raisons, je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir avec d\u00e9pens l\u2019appel de Charles-Eug\u00e8ne Martel contre l\u2019H\u00f4tel-Dieu St-Vallier; d\u2019infirmer le jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine afin de rejeter avec d\u00e9pens l\u2019appel de l\u2019h\u00f4pital contre le jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure en date du 18 juin 1965, et de r\u00e9tablir la condamnation solidaire prononc\u00e9e contre lui et contre le d\u00e9fendeur Patrick Vigneault au montant de $58,216.33 avec int\u00e9r\u00eat depuis l\u2019assignation et les d\u00e9pens.

Chaque nouvel acqu\u00e9reur s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 dans le contrat d\u2019achat \u00e0 payer la somme encore due aux intim\u00e9s. Le dernier acqu\u00e9reur n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 la poursuite. En ce qui a trait aux cinq autres la Cour sup\u00e9rieure n\u2019a accueilli l\u2019action que contre le premier \u00e9tant d\u2019avis que les op\u00e9rations subs\u00e9quentes n\u2019avaient cr\u00e9\u00e9 aucun lien de droit entre les autres d\u00e9fendeurs et les intim\u00e9s qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas partie au contrat. La Cour d\u2019appel, par un jugement majoritaire, a condamn\u00e9 les d\u00e9fendeurs solidairement avec le premier ayant conclu qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une clause de stipulation pour autrui et que la signification de la poursuite aux d\u00e9fendeurs \u00e9tait une manifestation suffisante de la volont\u00e9 des intim\u00e9s de l\u2019accepter. Deux des d\u00e9fendeurs ont interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9.\nLe texte de la clause en litige contenue dans les contrats de vente successifs intervenus entre les appelants (d\u00e9fendeurs) \u00e9tant une stipulation pour autrui (art. 1029 C.C.) elle entra\u00eenait pour chacun l\u2019obligation de payer la dette et non seulement celle de subir l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que.\nLe fait que les acqu\u00e9reurs successifs ont accept\u00e9 la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de paiement ne lib\u00e8re pas les autres d\u00e9biteurs qui ont fait la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation \u00e0 moins d\u2019une intention contraire qui ne se pr\u00e9sume pas (art. 1173 C.C).\nSans qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire de se prononcer sur la question de savoir s\u2019il r\u00e9sulte une solidarit\u00e9 du fait de la pluralit\u00e9 des d\u00e9biteurs, chacun d\u2019eux est redevable du montant entier de la dette. Real Property\u2014Sale\u2014Stipulation for the benefit of a third party\u2014Delegation of debtor\u2014Responsibility of delegating party towards original creditor\u2014Joint and several liability\u2014Civil Code, art. 1029, 1173.\nThe respondents, who originally had sold an hotel known as \u201cAuberge Mario\u201d, claimed the balance due on the purchase price from six successive purchasers. As a condition of the contract of sale, each purchaser had agreed to pay the balance owing to the respondents. The person who had last purchased the property did not dispute the claim. With respect to the five others the Superior Court upheld the claim as against the first purchaser only because, in the Court\u2019s opinion, there was no privity of contract between the respondents and the other defendants inasmuch as the respondents were not a party to the subsequent deals. The Court of Appeal, by a majority, held that the other purchasers of the property were also jointly and severally liable for the whole debt in that their undertakings were, in fact, a stipulation for the benefit of a third person and the service of a writ was sufficient to indicate the appellants\u2019 intention to accept the benefit of the stipulation made in their favour. Two of the defendants appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe provision contained in the successive purchase contracts executed by the appellants (defendants) was a stipulation for the benefit of a third person (art. 1029 C.C.), each appellant did not merely agree to suffer the hypothec but made himself personally liable for the debt (art. 1173 C.C.).\nThe fact that each successive purchaser accepted the delegation of the debt did not operate as a discharge because such a discharge must have been intended by all the parties concerned and that intention cannot be presumed.\nIrrespective of whether or not a joint and several liability existed by reason of the plurality of debtors, each debtor was personally liable for the whole debt.\nAPPEALS from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], reversing a decision in favour of certain defendants rendered by Smith J.

Dans ce dernier acte, on trouve sous le titre \u00abPrix\u00bb les stipulations suivantes:\nLa pr\u00e9sente vente est faite pour le prix de $50,250.00 dont $21,000.00 que le vendeur reconna\u00eet avoir re\u00e7u dont quittance pour autant.\nQuant \u00e0 la balance l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur s\u2019engage \u00e0 la payer de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\n(1) Une somme de $2,450.00 payable pour et \u00e0 l\u2019acquit du vendeur \u00e0 M.

Calixte Boisvert et G\u00e9rard Leblanc, \u00e0 qui pareille somme est due aux termes d\u2019un acte re\u00e7u devant Me P.A.

Canadian Indemnity[2], les appelants ont invoqu\u00e9 deux autres d\u00e9cisions: Reeves c. Perrault[3], et Legault c. Des\u00e8ve[4]. Ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre ne supporte leurs pr\u00e9tentions, c\u2019est le contraire qu\u2019il faut dire.\nDans l\u2019affaire Reeves, cette Cour a formellement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019un vendeur d\u2019immeuble a recours contre le tiers qui, s\u2019en portant subs\u00e9quemment acqu\u00e9reur avec plus grande \u00e9tendue, s\u2019engage envers l\u2019acheteur \u00e0 en payer le prix. Si en l\u2019occurrence l\u2019on n\u2019a admis le recours que pour une partie de ce prix c\u2019est uniquement parce qu\u2019avant d\u2019accepter la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de paiement, le cr\u00e9ancier avait exerc\u00e9 l\u2019action hypoth\u00e9caire contre l\u2019immeuble qu\u2019il avait vendu et en avait obtenu le d\u00e9laissement. On a appliqu\u00e9 le passage suivant de Pont (Priv. & Hypo., suite de Marcad\u00e9, n\u00b0 1180) qui est cit\u00e9 par le juge Taschereau (\u00e0 p. 630):\nSeulement, les cr\u00e9anciers devront soigneusement \u00e9viter, dans ces divers cas de mettre en avant l\u2019action hypoth\u00e9caire, s\u2019ils tiennent \u00e0 conserver l\u2019action personnelle qu\u2019ils ont contre le tiers d\u00e9tenteur; s\u2019ils concluaient tout d\u2019abord au d\u00e9laissement, ou s\u2019ils proc\u00e9daient aux poursuites par la sommation de payer ou de d\u00e9laisser ils seraient cens\u00e9s renoncer par cela m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019action personnelle, et d\u00e9sormais, ils seraient non recevables \u00e0 l\u2019exercer.\nIl n\u2019est aucunement n\u00e9cessaire de se demander si ce principe devrait aujourd\u2019hui s\u2019appliquer en regard de la l\u00e9gislation actuelle sur la proc\u00e9dure car ici la situation est tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rente: les intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas d\u2019abord exerc\u00e9 l\u2019action hypoth\u00e9caire mais bien l\u2019action personnelle. Ce n\u2019est que par amendement qu\u2019ils y ont joint, non pas \u00e0 proprement parler des conclusions hypoth\u00e9caires qui impliquent une demande de d\u00e9laissement mais des conclusions en d\u00e9claration de privil\u00e8ge. Le cumul des actions \u00e9tant maintenant permis, ils avaient indubitablement le droit de les joindre \u00e0 leur demande personnelle sans renoncer \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re. Au contraire, dans Reeves c. Perrault c\u2019est bien une action hypoth\u00e9caire proprement dite et suivie de d\u00e9laissement qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e et c\u2019est le d\u00e9laissement impliquant \u00e9viction qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant \u00e9teint, avant l\u2019acceptation de la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de paiement, une partie de la cr\u00e9ance proportionnelle \u00e0 la valeur de l\u2019immeuble d\u00e9laiss\u00e9.\nDans Legault c. Des\u00e8ve, le d\u00e9fendeur avait acquis un immeuble par dation en paiement \u00ab\u00e0 la charge de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que\u00bb le grevant en faveur du demandeur. Il s\u2019agissait de savoir si cette stipulation l\u2019obligeait seulement \u00e0 subir l\u2019action hypoth\u00e9caire sans recours en garantie ou si elle avait \u00e9galement pour effet de cr\u00e9er une obligation personnelle. On en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019en l\u2019occurrence le d\u00e9fendeur avait seulement consenti \u00e0 subir l\u2019\u00e9viction, le juge Mignault disant (\u00e0 p. 75):\nOn aurait pu \u00e9viter toute \u00e9quivoque en disant: \u00e0 la charge de payer l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que de $15,000.00 ci-apr\u00e8s mentionn\u00e9e, et alors il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 certain que Lecavalier et Chass\u00e9 voulaient faire une d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de paiement, et non pas seulement se prot\u00e9ger contre un recours \u00e9ventuel en garantie de la part de Des\u00e8ve.\nDans le cas pr\u00e9sent, aucun doute n\u2019est possible. Les actes d\u2019achat sign\u00e9s par les appelants stipulent tous deux la charge de payer la dette dont il s\u2019agit et non pas seulement celle de subir le privil\u00e8ge qui la garantit. Cela ressort tant de la stipulation elle-m\u00eame que du fait que cet engagement est stipul\u00e9 comme partie du prix de vente. En prenant l\u2019immeuble chacun des appelants s\u2019est oblig\u00e9 \u00e0 en payer le prix et a convenu que cette obligation jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de la somme qui fait l\u2019objet du pr\u00e9sent litige serait ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e par le paiement aux intim\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019acquit du d\u00e9biteur primitif.\nLes appelants ont soutenu devant nous que cet engagement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 par la revente de l\u2019immeuble avant que les intim\u00e9s eussent accept\u00e9 la stipulation en leur faveur. Cette question de r\u00e9vocation a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e par cette Cour dans l\u2019affaire Reeves. On y a not\u00e9 que l\u2019action hypoth\u00e9caire et le d\u00e9laissement avaient pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 l\u2019acceptation de la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de paiement et que par cons\u00e9quent l\u2019obligation s\u2019\u00e9tait trouv\u00e9e \u00e9teinte jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de la valeur de l\u2019immeuble d\u00e9laiss\u00e9 avant que l\u2019acceptation ait lieu. Ici, rien de tel ne se pr\u00e9sente. Aucune des ventes successives n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e et jamais l\u2019un des vendeurs n\u2019a r\u00e9voqu\u00e9 la stipulation en faveur des intim\u00e9s. Tout ce que chacun d\u2019eux a fait a \u00e9t\u00e9 de charger un nouvel acqu\u00e9reur d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter son obligation \u00e0 sa place. On ne se lib\u00e8re pas d\u2019une obligation en chargeant un tiers de l\u2019ex\u00e9cuter. M\u00eame en acceptant la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de paiement, le cr\u00e9ancier ne lib\u00e8re pas le d\u00e9biteur primitif mais acquiert un d\u00e9biteur additionnel \u00e0 moins d\u2019une intention contraire qui ne se pr\u00e9sume pas. C\u2019est ce que l\u2019art. 1173 C.C. exprime dans les termes suivants:\n1173. La d\u00e9l\u00e9gation par laquelle un d\u00e9biteur donne \u00e0 son cr\u00e9ancier un nouveau d\u00e9biteur qui s\u2019oblige envers le cr\u00e9ancier, n\u2019op\u00e8re point de novation \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il ne soit \u00e9vident que le cr\u00e9ancier entend d\u00e9charger le d\u00e9biteur qui fait la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation.\nQuelle est la cons\u00e9quence de la pluralit\u00e9 de d\u00e9biteurs d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une telle situation? En r\u00e9sulte-t-il solidarit\u00e9? Sur ce point la doctrine et la jurisprudence sont divis\u00e9es. Cependant, on est unanime \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre que chacun des d\u00e9biteurs est redevable du montant entier de la dette. C\u2019est \u00e9videmment pour que cette question n\u2019ait pas besoin d\u2019\u00eatre tranch\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente cause que les demandeurs ont conclu non pas \u00e0 une condamnation solidaire mais \u00e0 une condamnation in solidum. Comme on l\u2019a vu, la Cour d\u2019appel a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de prononcer une condamnation solidaire en ajoutant cependant que celle-ci \u00e9tait sans effet \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des d\u00e9fendeurs entre eux. Les motifs de jugement font voir que l\u2019on entendait par l\u00e0 prononcer une condamnation ayant exactement les m\u00eames cons\u00e9quences juridiques que celles que les demandeurs recherchaient par leurs conclusions in solidum, savoir une condamnation de chacun des d\u00e9fendeurs \u00e0 payer la totalit\u00e9 de la dette de telle fa\u00e7on que l\u2019acquittement par un lib\u00e8re tous les autres mais sans les autres effets sp\u00e9ciaux de la solidarit\u00e9. Vu qu\u2019en la pr\u00e9sente cause ces autres effets de la solidarit\u00e9 n\u2019ont pas besoin d\u2019\u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s, il ne para\u00eet pas qu\u2019il y ait lieu d\u2019intervenir pour modifier la formule adopt\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel ce qui n\u2019implique cependant aucune expression d\u2019opinion sur cette question de solidarit\u00e9.\nJe suis d\u2019avis de rejeter les appels avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppels rejet\u00e9s avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureur de l\u2019appelant Fernand Proulx: Brissette, St-Jacques et Dureault, Longueuil.\nProcureur de l\u2019appelante Dame Odilon Beno\u00eet: Jacques Pag\u00e9, Sherbrooke. \u2018\nProcureurs des intim\u00e9s: Letarte, St-Hilaire, De Blois, De Ban\u00e9, Proulx, Becotte et Parent, Qu\u00e9bec.\n[1] [1969] B.R. 461.\n[2] [1937] R.C.S. 368.\n[3] (1885), 10 R.C.S. 616.\n[4] (1920), 61 R.C.S. 65.",

L\u2019accident est survenu dans une agglom\u00e9ration urbaine sur une route bien \u00e9clair\u00e9e. Le temps \u00e9tait clair et le pav\u00e9 sec. D\u2019apr\u00e8s les constatations faites apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident, la trace laiss\u00e9e par la motocyclette de l\u2019appelant, qui avait appliqu\u00e9 les freins en voyant la man\u0153uvre du camion, \u00e9tait de 68 pieds. Une fois \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019une seconde fracture lorsqu\u2019il tenta, avec l\u2019autorisation de son m\u00e9decin, de se lever et de marcher \u00e0 l\u2019aide de b\u00e9quilles sur sa jambe qui n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9e. Il perdit l\u2019\u00e9quilibre en voulant franchir une porte munie d\u2019un ressort. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure sur la poursuite du p\u00e8re de l\u2019appelant, qui agissait en sa qualit\u00e9 personnelle et en tant que tuteur, a imput\u00e9 l\u2019accident \u00e0 la faute commune du motocycliste et du camionneur. Quant aux dommages subis par l\u2019appelant en raison de sa seconde fracture \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas directement imputables \u00e0 l\u2019accident de circulation. La Cour d\u2019appel a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure sur l\u2019un et l\u2019autre point. L\u2019appelant, devenu majeur, a interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 cette Cour. Le p\u00e8re a obtenu l\u2019autorisation de se joindre \u00e0 lui comme appelant pour faire valoir sa r\u00e9clamation personnelle, m\u00eame si le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 \u00e9tait inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 $10,000.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel est accueilli.\nEn l\u2019absence de preuve d\u2019une faute imputable au motocycliste et ayant contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019accident, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit \u00eatre tenu totalement responsable, parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas observ\u00e9 les dispositions du Code de la route en s\u2019engageant \u00e0 gauche de la ligne m\u00e9diane pour tenter de compl\u00e9ter son virage sans s\u2019assurer qu\u2019aucun v\u00e9hicule ne venait en sens inverse.\n\u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la seconde fracture n\u2019est nullement attribuable \u00e0 une faute de la victime et que, d\u2019autre part, sa condition \u00e9tait une cons\u00e9quence directe du premier accident, c\u2019est \u00e0 ce premier accident qu\u2019il faut rattacher la seconde fracture subie \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital.\nMotor vehicle\u2014Collision between a truck and a motorcycle\u2014Contributory negligence\u2014Second accident in hospital\u2014Whether directly attributable to the first accident\u2014Highway Code, R.S.Q. 1964, c. 231, s. 40(13), (18).\nOn the evening of June 10, 1965, at approximately 9:30 (P.M.), the appellant, who was then 17 years of age, suffered an open fracture of his shin-bone and a multiple fracture of his thigh-bone when the motorcycle he was riding on collided with a small size truck coming in the opposite direction. The driver of the truck had suddenly attempted to complete a left turn without signalling his intention otherwise than by a sign with his arm. The accident happened in an urban area on a well lighted road. It was a clear night and the pavement was dry. According to the findings made after the accident the tire marks left on the pavement by the motorcycle when the appellant applied the brakes after he had noticed the truck move extended over a distance of sixty-eight feet. Once in the hospital the appellant sustained a further fracture of his injured leg. While he attempted, with his doctor\u2019s permission, to get out of his bed and to walk on his other leg using the assistance of crutches, he lost his balance and fell as he was trying to pass through a door equipped with a spring device. Upon a claim by the appellant\u2019s father, who was acting both for himself and as his son\u2019s tutor, the Superior Court found that both the driver of the motorcycle and the driver of the truck were at fault. As regards the damages sustained by the appellant by reason of his leg being fractured a second time at the hospital, the Court expressed the view that his further injuries were not directly attributable to the traffic accident. The Court of Appeal confirmed the above decision of the Superior Court on both points. The appellant, now of full age, appealed to this Court. The father was authorized to join in the action although his claim was under $10,000.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nIn the absence of a fault attributable to the driver of the motorcycle which would have contributed to the accident, the respondent should be held fully liable, in that he had not complied with the provisions of the Highway Code by crossing the center line and entering the left hand side of the road without making sure that there was no vehicle coming in the opposite direction.\nIn view of the fact that the second fracture was in no way attributable to the victim\u2019s fault and that, on the other hand, his condition was a direct consequence of the first accident, both accidents should be regarded as interrelated.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], affirming a judgment of Veilleux J.

L\u2019intim\u00e9, qui venait en sens inverse au volant d\u2019un petit camion, fit soudainement un virage \u00e0 gauche pour s\u2019engager dans une rue transversale. Malgr\u00e9 un freinage \u00e9nergique, la motocyclette vint frapper en plein milieu le flanc droit du camion et le motocycliste fut gri\u00e8vement bless\u00e9 subissant une fracture ouverte du tibia droit de m\u00eame qu\u2019une fracture ouverte comminutive et multifragmentaire du f\u00e9mur droit. Pour comble de malheur, alors que la victime \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital et y marchait avec des b\u00e9quilles, un faux mouvement lui fit porter une partie de son poids sur la jambe bless\u00e9e provoquant la rupture de la fracture du f\u00e9mur en voie de gu\u00e9rison et il a fallu faire ult\u00e9rieurement une r\u00e9duction sanglante avec greffe osseuse.\nLa Cour sup\u00e9rieure, sur la poursuite du p\u00e8re agissant tant personnellement qu\u2019en qualit\u00e9 de tuteur, a jug\u00e9 l\u2019accident imputable \u00e0 la faute commune du motocycliste et du camionneur. De plus, elle a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les dommages d\u00e9coulant de la seconde fracture \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital comme n\u2019\u00e9tant pas imputables \u00e0 l\u2019accident de circulation, de telle sorte que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 payer que la moiti\u00e9 d\u2019une partie du pr\u00e9judice total.\nLa Cour d\u2019appel ayant confirm\u00e9, le motocycliste devenu majeur s\u2019est pourvu devant nous et permission a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e \u00e0 son p\u00e8re de se joindre \u00e0 lui comme appelant pour faire valoir sa r\u00e9clamation personnelle quoique le montant soit inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 $10,000.\nL\u2019accident est survenu dans un chemin pav\u00e9 de 40 pieds de largeur, rue principale de Bromptonville. C\u2019\u00e9tait le 10 juin 1965, vers 9 h. 30 du soir, le temps \u00e9tait clair et le pav\u00e9 sec. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la version non contredite du motocycliste, son phare \u00e9tait allum\u00e9. Comme le dit le juge de premi\u00e8re instance:\nIl est assez difficile de comprendre la version du d\u00e9fendeur qui nous dit qu\u2019il n\u2019a pu voir la motocyclette alors qu\u2019il pouvait voir 500 pieds devant lui.\nCependant, il a partag\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 par le motif suivant:\nQuant au jeune Rodrigue Chartier, il devait certainement aller plus vite qu\u2019il nous dit, car avant de venir en collision avec le v\u00e9hicule du d\u00e9fendeur, sa motocyclette a laiss\u00e9 des traces sur une distance de 68 pieds. S\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 une vitesse moindre, vu la largeur de la rue, il aurait pu contourner le v\u00e9hicule du d\u00e9fendeur et \u00e9viter la collision. Dans ces circonstances, la responsabilit\u00e9 sera partag\u00e9e \u00e9galement.\nIl s\u2019agit essentiellement d\u2019une question de fait sur laquelle le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 en appel, par cons\u00e9quent, suivant une r\u00e8gle depuis longtemps \u00e9tablie (Lefeunteum c. Beaudoin)[2], nous ne devons intervenir que s\u2019il y a clairement erreur dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve. Celle-ci est extr\u00eamement succincte. Le d\u00e9fendeur qui circulait dans une rue bien \u00e9clair\u00e9e, on voit les r\u00e9verb\u00e8res sur les photographies, d\u00e9clare simplement qu\u2019il n\u2019a rien vu venir. Andr\u00e9 Ouellette, qui \u00e9tait assis \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de lui dans le camion, dit qu\u2019il a aper\u00e7u la motocyclette \u00abtrop vite pour dire un mot\u00bb, il ajoute qu\u2019il n\u2019a \u00abpas remarqu\u00e9 s\u2019il y avait de l\u2019\u00e9clairage dessus\u00bb et il relate qu\u2019apr\u00e8s le choc le d\u00e9fendeur a dit: \u00abveux-tu bien me dire qui c\u2019est qui nous frappe \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re comme \u00e7a?\u00bb\nQuant au motocycliste, il affirme qu\u2019il a appliqu\u00e9 les freins \u00e0 environ 60 pieds du camion au moment o\u00f9 celui-ci commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 faire son virage \u00e0 gauche sans l\u2019avoir pr\u00e9alablement signal\u00e9 par un feu clignotant. Cela n\u2019est pas contredit par l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui dit \u00abj\u2019ai sorti mon bras\u00bb. Le chiffre de 68 pieds mentionn\u00e9 par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni par l\u2019agent de l\u00e0 paix qui a mesur\u00e9 la trace apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident. Aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite de la vitesse qu\u2019il fallait en d\u00e9duire. De m\u00eame, aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite qu\u2019\u00e0 30 milles \u00e0 l\u2019heure, vitesse maximum permise \u00e0 l\u2019endroit dont il s\u2019agit, le motocycliste aurait pu contourner le camion et \u00e9viter la collision. On sait cependant, comme les photographies l\u2019indiquent, que le motocycliste d\u00e9valait une pente appr\u00e9ciable. Dans ces conditions, o\u00f9 sont dans la preuve les \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9cessaires pour conclure \u00e0 un exc\u00e8s de vitesse? Nous ne savons pas quelle influence la d\u00e9clivit\u00e9 a pu jouer dans la longueur de la trace, n\u2019ayant aucune indication pr\u00e9cise \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. De m\u00eame, rien ne nous fait voir si la longueur de la trace de freinage pour la motocyclette dont il s\u2019agit doit \u00eatre sensiblement la m\u00eame que pour une automobile. Par contre, nous savons que la visibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait d\u2019au moins 500 pieds ce qui fait que l\u2019on voit fort mal quel r\u00f4le une vitesse excessive aurait pu jouer dans cet accident.\nPour ce qui est de la possibilit\u00e9 de contourner le camion, la seule preuve est la r\u00e9ponse du motocycliste \u00e0 la question du juge: \u00abj\u2019\u00e9tais rendu trop proche\u00bb. On voit mal comment le tribunal pouvait juger autrement en l\u2019absence de toute preuve \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cette affirmation, on voit \u00e9galement mal comment cette man\u0153uvre aurait pu se faire tout en freinant, mais sans freiner, il aurait fallu passer derri\u00e8re le camion avant qu\u2019il ne soit engag\u00e9 dans la rue transversale. Au reste, s\u2019il est vrai que la rue est large, les photographies montrent au centre une double ligne blanche qu\u2019il est interdit de franchir. En le faisant le motocycliste, dont la vue \u00e9tait obstru\u00e9e par le camion, risquait d\u2019aller heurter de face un v\u00e9hicule venant en sens inverse et c\u2019est ce qu\u2019il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au juge avoir redout\u00e9. Les faits de la pr\u00e9sente cause sont substantiellement identiques \u00e0 ceux qui ont fait l\u2019objet de l\u2019arr\u00eat de notre Cour dans Latreille c. Lamontagne et Carri\u00e8re[3] et il convient d\u2019y appliquer ce que mon coll\u00e8gue, le juge Fauteux, y a dit au nom de la majorit\u00e9 (\u00e0 p. 104):\nEn droit, l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui voulait tourner \u00e0 gauche, devait, suivant le Code de la route, 8-9 Eliz. II, c. 67, art. 36, para. 18, s\u2019approcher de la ligne m\u00e9diane de la route 29, continuer en ligne droite jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la ligne m\u00e9diane de la rue St-\u00c9douard et effectuer le virage \u00e0 gauche d\u00e8s que la voie \u00e9tait libre. Il devait aussi, suivant le para. 13 du m\u00eame article, c\u00e9der le passage \u00e0 tout v\u00e9hicule venant en direction inverse et entrant dans l\u2019intersection ou qui en \u00e9tait si pr\u00e8s qu\u2019il pouvait y avoir danger de tourner devant ce v\u00e9hicule. Ce qui est certain, c\u2019est qu\u2019en quittant sa droite pour conduire \u00e0 gauche de la ligne blanche, avant d\u2019arriver au c\u00f4t\u00e9 est de l\u2019intersection, puis, \u00e9tant arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 ce point, en tentant de reprendre sa droite, comme semble fortement l\u2019indiquer la position des roues d\u2019avant du camion, ou en immobilisant, comme lui-m\u00eame Ta pr\u00e9tendu, son v\u00e9hicule compl\u00e8tement \u00e0 gauche de la ligne blanche, Carri\u00e8re a viol\u00e9 le Code de la route, il a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une situation propre \u00e0 jeter la confusion dans l\u2019esprit des personnes venant en sens oppos\u00e9, et au regard de toutes les circonstances r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es par la preuve, il a cr\u00e9\u00e9 le danger que ces dispositions du Code de la route avaient pour objet de conjurer et dont l\u2019inobservance, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, eut l\u2019accident pour cons\u00e9quence.\nAvec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour le juge de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et ceux de la Cour d\u2019appel, il faut donc dire que l\u2019on a fait erreur en partageant \u00e9galement la responsabilit\u00e9 entre celui qui a fait la man\u0153uvre ill\u00e9gale, cause de l\u2019accident, et celui qui n\u2019a pu r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9viter. En l\u2019absence de preuve d\u2019une faute imputable au motocycliste et ayant contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019accident, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit en \u00eatre tenu totalement responsable.\nPour ce qui est maintenant de l\u2019accident survenu \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital et qui a caus\u00e9 une seconde fracture, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a dit simplement: \u00ables dommages comme r\u00e9sultat de cette chute ne doivent pas \u00eatre imput\u00e9s au d\u00e9fendeur\u00bb. En Cour d\u2019appel le juge Casey a dit:\nAfter having been in the hospital with a broken leg for some time, Appellant\u2019s son was allowed to go home, but not to use the injured leg. Some time later, he returned to the hospital to have his cast removed. While there, he had an accidental fall and broke the same leg again.\nThe trial judge refused to allow any of the damages arising out of this second accident. In the circumstances disclosed by the evidence, I am satisfied that this decision was well founded.\nQuelles sont ces circonstances r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es par la preuve? On les trouve uniquement dans le t\u00e9moignage de la victime. En effet, tout ce que le m\u00e9decin a dit c\u2019est qu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment- l\u00e0 il lui avait donn\u00e9 la permission de se lever et de marcher sur une jambe, celle qui n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9e, avec des b\u00e9quilles. Il ne sait pas ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9. Quant au bless\u00e9, il a au proc\u00e8s r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 en substance ce qu\u2019il avait dit \u00e0 l\u2019interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable:\nLe matin, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9jeun\u00e9, je suis parti pour aller \u00e0 la toilette, pour la porte c\u2019est une chose \u00e0 air, pour revenir elle revient assez vite, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s un pied avant d\u2019\u00eatre ferm\u00e9e compl\u00e8tement, elle revient tranquillement, j\u2019ai mis ma b\u00e9quille pour la retenir, la porte a frapp\u00e9 dessus, j\u2019ai perdu l\u2019\u00e9quilibre. Pour me garantir, j\u2019ai mis mon pied \u00e0 terre, en mettant mon pied \u00e0 terre, \u00e7a recass\u00e9 et j\u2019ai tomb\u00e9 sur le dos.\nPeut-on conclure de cette preuve que ce second accident est imputable \u00e0 une faute de la victime ou doit-on, au contraire, le rattacher au premier dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 est responsable? Il est \u00e9vident que si le jeune homme n\u2019avait pas subi une premi\u00e8re fracture par la faute de l\u2019intim\u00e9, il n\u2019aurait pas subi la seconde. On ne peut pas lui reprocher d\u2019avoir march\u00e9 avec des b\u00e9quilles. Son m\u00e9decin le lui avait prescrit. \u00c9videmment, il lui avait \u00e9galement dit de ne pas faire porter son poids sur la jambe bless\u00e9e mais de se supporter avec des b\u00e9quilles. Cependant, sans le faire expr\u00e8s, il a perdu l\u2019\u00e9quilibre en voulant passer dans une porte \u00e0 ressort. Faut-il voir l\u00e0 une faute? Celui qui est oblig\u00e9 de marcher avec des b\u00e9quilles n\u2019est \u00e9videmment pas entra\u00een\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire mais on ne peut s\u00fbrement pas le lui reprocher. S\u2019il est oblig\u00e9 de s\u2019y aventurer, c\u2019est comme cons\u00e9quence du premier accident dont la responsabilit\u00e9 est imputable \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nDans son m\u00e9moire, l\u2019appelant fait \u00e9tat d\u2019instructions donn\u00e9es \u00e0 un jury par le juge Yves Bernier de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure dans les termes suivants:\nAlors, ce sera \u00e0 vous de d\u00e9cider si cette deuxi\u00e8me section du tendon est due \u00e0 l\u2019accident d\u2019automobile, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral o\u00f9 il fut mis par cet accident, ou si c\u2019est d\u00fb \u00e0 une faute personnelle du demandeur, de sa part en cette occasion au retour de l\u2019h\u00f4pital. A-t-il pris un risque, a-t-il fait quelque chose d\u2019insens\u00e9, a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gligent? Et vous pouvez vous demander si sa condition dans laquelle il se trouvait n\u2019est pas aussi une cause \u00e0 ce deuxi\u00e8me incident.\n\u00c9tait-ce d\u00fb \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat du tendon, \u00e0 sa faiblesse, \u00e0 la faiblesse de celui-ci ou \u00e0 une conduite n\u00e9gligente ou repr\u00e9hensible de la part du demandeur?\nIci la preuve ne d\u00e9montre pas que la seconde fracture soit le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019une faute de la victime. Comme elle est \u00e9videmment par ailleurs la cons\u00e9quence de la condition dans laquelle cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019est trouv\u00e9e par suite du premier accident, il faut l\u2019y rattacher. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance ayant fait l\u2019estimation des dommages en excluant ce qu\u2019il croyait devoir rattacher \u00e0 la seconde fracture, une nouvelle estimation devient n\u00e9cessaire.\nPour les souffrances, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que ce qui en a occasionn\u00e9 le plus a \u00e9t\u00e9 la derni\u00e8re intervention avec pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement d\u2019un greffon sur la cr\u00eate iliaque. Il y a donc lieu d\u2019accorder $1,000 au lieu des $300 allou\u00e9s par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance. Pour les inconv\u00e9nients, il semble \u00e0 propos de doubler le montant de $200. Pour l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 totale temporaire, la preuve justifie le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 par l\u2019appelant dans son factum, savoir $5,785. Par contre, il ne semble pas que l\u2019on doive modifier le montant de $8,000 accord\u00e9 pour incapacit\u00e9 partielle permanente vu que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance ne para\u00eet pas avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que celle-ci avait \u00e9t\u00e9 aggrav\u00e9e par l\u2019accident survenu \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital. Pour ces raisons, le montant accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant Rodrigue Chartier est fix\u00e9 \u00e0 $15,185 au Heu de $5,250 (la moiti\u00e9 de $10,500).\nQuant \u00e0 la condamnation en faveur de l\u2019appelant Andr\u00e9 Chartier, il faut ajouter \u00e0 la somme de $1,873.50, \u00e0 laquelle le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a estim\u00e9 ses dommages avant d\u2019en retrancher la moiti\u00e9 pour responsabilit\u00e9 partag\u00e9e, la somme de $550 pour partie du compte du chirurgien imputable au second accident et $100 pour frais de voyage et de d\u00e9placement \u00e0 ce sujet. La condamnation en faveur d\u2019Andr\u00e9 Chartier sera donc port\u00e9e \u00e0 $2,523.50.\nPour ces motifs, je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir l\u2019appel des appelants avec les d\u00e9pens d\u2019un seul appel pour le tout en cette Cour et en Cour d\u2019appel; d\u2019infirmer le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel et de modifier le jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure pour porter \u00e0 $2,523.50 le montant accord\u00e9 au demandeur Andr\u00e9 Chartier, et \u00e0 $15,185 la somme payable \u00e0 Rodrigue Chartier \u00e0 titre de demandeur ayant repris l\u2019instance \u00e0 la place de son tuteur.\nAppel accueilli avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureur des appelants: G\u00e9rard Boudreau, Sherbrooke.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9: Leblanc, Barnard, Leblanc, Allaire, B\u00e9dard & Fournier, Sherbrooke.\n[1] [1969] B.R. 80.\n[2] (1897), 28 R.S.C. 89.\n[3] [1967] R.C.S. 95.",

The respondent argued that the delay of 30 days prescribed by s. 18 of the Divorce Act, 1968 (Can.), 16-17 Eliz. II, c. 24, were expired and that this Court did not have the power to grant leave. The petitioner argued that ss. 41 and 64 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, applied and that the delays therein mentioned were not expired.\nHeld: The motion for leave to appeal must be dismissed.\nThe Court had no jurisdiction to grant the motion. The provisions of s. 18 of the Divorce Act were applicable by virtue of the principle that the provisions of a special law, in case of conflict with those of a general law, override those of the general law.\nAPPLICATION for leave to appeal in a divorce matter.

Lacombe, pour l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nLe jugement de la Cour fut rendu par\nLE JUGE FAUTEUX:\u2014Dans une requ\u00eate, dat\u00e9e du 25 avril 1969 et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 cette Cour le 20 mai dernier, dame Massicotte, \u00e9pouse de l\u2019intim\u00e9 Boutin, demande la permission d\u2019interjeter appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision rendue le 19 mars 1969 par la Cour d\u2019appel de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Par cette d\u00e9cision, la Cour d\u2019appel a rejet\u00e9 le pourvoi que dame Massicotte avait log\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un jugement conditionnel de divorce, prononc\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, le 29 novembre 1968, par M. le juge Hector Perrier, si\u00e9geant en Cour sup\u00e9rieure (Division des divorces), en vertu de la Loi sur le divorce, 16-17 Eliz. II, c. 24.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019oppose \u00e0 cette demande. Il repr\u00e9sente qu\u2019aux termes de la loi particuli\u00e8re qui r\u00e9git la mati\u00e8re, soit la Loi sur le divorce, la Cour supr\u00eame n\u2019a plus, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le pouvoir d\u2019accorder la permission demand\u00e9e. Au soutien de cette pr\u00e9tention, l\u2019intim\u00e9 invoque les dispositions du deuxi\u00e8- me alin\u00e9a de Tart. 18 de cette loi, lesquelles prescrivent qu\u2019une telle permission peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e dans les trente jours du jugement ou de l\u2019ordonnance frapp\u00e9s d\u2019appel ou dans le d\u00e9lai plus long que la Cour supr\u00eame ou un juge de cette Cour peuvent, avant l\u2019expiration de ces trente jours, fixer ou accorder; et l\u2019intim\u00e9 signale que ce d\u00e9lai de trente jours est expir\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nD\u2019autre part, la requ\u00e9rante se retranche sur les dispositions de l\u2019art. 41 de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame.\nIl convient de juxtaposer le texte de l\u2019art. 41(1) et (2) de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame et celui de l\u2019article 18 de la Loi sur le divorce.\nLoi sur la Cour supr\u00eame:\n41. (1) Sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (3), il peut \u00eatre interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame, avec l\u2019autorisation de cette Cour, contre tout jugement d\u00e9finitif ou autre de la plus haute cour de dernier ressort dans une province, ou de l\u2019un de ses juges, o\u00f9 jugement peut \u00eatre obtenu dans la cause particuli\u00e8re dont on veut appeler \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame, qu\u2019une autre cour ait refus\u00e9 ou non l\u2019autorisation d\u2019en appeler \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame.\n(2) L\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel aux termes du pr\u00e9sent article peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e pendant la p\u00e9riode fix\u00e9e par l\u2019article 64 ou dans les trente jours qui la suivent, ou dans tel autre d\u00e9lai prorog\u00e9 que la Cour supr\u00eame ou un juge peut fixer ou accorder, soit avant, soit apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration desdits trente jours.\nNotons que la p\u00e9riode fix\u00e9e par l\u2019art. 64 est de soixante jours, les mois de juillet et ao\u00fbt \u00e9tant exclus dans le calcul de ces soixante jours.\nLoi sur le divorce:\n18. (1) Appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel rendue en vertu de l\u2019article 17 peut \u00eatre interjet\u00e9, sur une question de droit, devant la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, avec la permission de cette Cour.\n(2) La permission d\u2019interjeter appel en vertu du pr\u00e9sent article peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e dans les trente jours du jugement ou de l\u2019ordonnance frapp\u00e9s d\u2019appel ou dans le d\u00e9lai plus long que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada ou un juge de cette Cour peuvent, avant l\u2019expiration de ces trente jours, fixer ou accorder.\nLes soulign\u00e9s sont de moi.\nIl est manifeste que ces dispositions de l\u2019art. 41 sont inconciliables avec celles de l\u2019art. 18, et ce, non seulement quant \u00e0 la nature des questions sur lesquelles un appel peut \u00eatre interjet\u00e9 avec la permission de la Cour, mais aussi quant au d\u00e9lai dans lequel la Cour a le pouvoir d\u2019accorder cette permission et quant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode de temps pendant laquelle la Cour ou un juge de la Cour a le pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9tendre ce d\u00e9lai. G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, lorsque le Parlement donne \u00e0 cette Cour ou \u00e0 Tun de ses juges le pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9tendre le d\u00e9lai dans lequel une permission d\u2019appeler peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e, il permet que ce pouvoir puisse \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 m\u00eame apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9. Tel est le cas, par exemple, dans la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame, cf. art. 41(2), dans le Code criminel, cf. art. 599 et dans la Loi sur la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier, cf. art. 82(3).\nTelle n\u2019est pas la situation sous la Loi sur le divorce. Sous cette loi, la Cour ou l\u2019un de ses juges n\u2019ont aucun pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9tendre le d\u00e9lai de trente jours, apr\u00e8s son expiration. La disposition de l\u2019art. 18 sur le point est claire et pr\u00e9cise.\nLa requ\u00e9rante peut-elle, dans les circonstances, invoquer victorieusement les dispositions de l\u2019art. 41 de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame? En pr\u00e9sence de deux lois du Parlement, dont l\u2019une, g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, a pour objet l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la Cour supr\u00eame et la d\u00e9finition de la juridiction d\u2019appel de cette Cour et l\u2019autre, sp\u00e9ciale, a exclusivement pour objet le divorce et \u00e9puise, sur le sujet, la mati\u00e8re de la loi, nous devons, \u00e0 mon avis, appliquer le principe voulant que les dispositions de la loi sp\u00e9ciale, dans le cas o\u00f9 elles sont inconciliables avec celles de la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, priment celles de la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Maintes fois, ce principe et sa raison d\u2019\u00eatre ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s. On en trouve l\u2019expression dans Re Township of York and Township of North York[1]:\nIt is, of course, elementary that special legislation overrides general legislation in case of a conflict\u2014the general maxim is Generalia specialibus non derogant\u2014see Lancashire Asylums Board v. Manchester Corporation, (1900) 1 Q.B. 458, at p. 470, per Smith, L.J.\u2014even where the general legislation is subsequent; Barker v. Edgar, (1898) A.C. 748, at p. 754, in the Judicial Committee. The reason is that the Legislature has given attention to the particular subject and made provision for it, and the presumption is that such provision is not to be interfered with by general legislation intended for a wide range of objects: Craies on Statute Law, 3rd ed., p. 317.\nJe dirais donc que nous n\u2019avons pas juridiction pour accorder la demande de dame Massicotte et, pour cette raison, je rejetterais avec d\u00e9pens la requ\u00eate pour permission d\u2019appeler.\nRequ\u00eate rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs de la requ\u00e9rante: Deschesnes, de Grandpr\u00e9, Colas, Godin et Lapointe, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00ea: Martineau, Walker, Allison, Beaulieu, Phelan et Tetley, Montr\u00e9al.\n[1] (1925), 57 O.L.R. 644 at 648.",

Ces navires effectuent le transport g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de marchandises dans les limites et \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur des eaux de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, particuli\u00e8rement entre Montr\u00e9al et Qu\u00e9bec et les ports le long du fleuve Saint-Laurent. L\u2019appelante a sept bureaux r\u00e9gionaux et installations portuaires, tous situ\u00e9s dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Ces navires ont en trois circonstances seulement, et ceci exceptionnellement, fait des voyages au-del\u00e0 des limites territoriales de la province, soit deux \u00e0 Toronto en 1964 et un en Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse en 1965.\nSur la demande du syndicat intim\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre accr\u00e9dit\u00e9 comme agent n\u00e9gociateur des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019appelante, le Conseil canadien des relations ouvri\u00e8res a ordonn\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019un scrutin. L\u2019appelante s\u2019est alors adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure pour obtenir, en vertu des art. 846 et 847 du Code de proc\u00e9dure civile, la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019un bref introductif d\u2019instance pour faire suspendre les proc\u00e9dures.

Par un jugement majoritaire, la Cour d\u2019Appel rejeta la requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelante pour le motif que le Conseil n\u2019\u00e9tait pas soumis au droit de surveillance et de r\u00e9forme de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure.

Le droit de gr\u00e8ve et le droit de n\u00e9gocier collectivement ainsi que la d\u00e9termination de mati\u00e8res telles que les heures de travail, les taux des salaires, les conditions de travail et autres semblables, sont une partie essentielle de l\u2019administration et de l\u2019op\u00e9ration de toute entreprise commerciale ou industrielle. Le pouvoir de r\u00e9glementer ces mati\u00e8res dans le cas d\u2019une entreprise tombant sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 du Parlement appartient au Parlement. Le m\u00eame principe s\u2019applique aux entreprises du ressort l\u00e9gislatif des provinces. La Loi qu\u2019on a voulu appliquer \u00e0 l\u2019appelante\u2014Loi sur les relations industrielles et sur les enqu\u00eates visant les diff\u00e9rends du travail\u2014ne peut r\u00e9gir que les entreprises qui sont du ressort du Parlement. Tel n\u2019\u00e9tant pas le cas de l\u2019appelante, elle ne peut y \u00eatre assujettie. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e9tait donc justifi\u00e9 d\u2019autoriser la d\u00e9livrance du bref.\nLabour relations\u2014Motion to evoke decision of Canada Labour Relations Board\u2014Superintending and reforming power of the Superior Court\u2014Navigation and shipping\u2014Jurisdiction of Canada Labour Relations Board\u2014Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 152, s. 55(a), (c)\u2014B.N.A. Act, ss. 91(10), (29), 92(10)(a), (b)\u2014Code of Civil Procedure, art. 20, 33, 846, 847.\nThe appellant owned and operated three coastal boats attached to the port of Quebec for general cargo transport within the limits of and in the interior waters of the province of Quebec, particularly between Montreal and Quebec and ports along the St. Lawrence River. The appellant operated seven regional port offices and facilities all within the province of Quebec. On three exceptional circumstances only, these boats went twice to Toronto in 1964 and once to Nova Scotia in 1965.\nOn the petition of the respondent Union for certification for the appellant\u2019s employees, the Canada Labour Relations Board ordered that a vote be taken. The appellant then applied to the Superior Court under art. 846 and 847 of the Code of Civil Procedure for the issuance of a writ of summons to suspend all subsequent proceedings. The trial judge granted the issuance of the writ. By a majority judgment, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant\u2019s petition on the ground that the Board was not subject to the superintending and reforming power of the Superior Court. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court. Held: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe Superior Court has a superintending and reforming power under art. 20 and 846 of the Code of Civil Procedure over the procedings and decisions of the Canada Labour Relations Board (Three Rivers Boatman Limited v. Conseil canadien des relations ouvri\u00e8res et al., [1969] S.C.R. 607).\nOn the evidence, the maritime operations of the appellant were intraprovincial and were limited to the territory of the province of Quebec. The three exceptional trips outside the province did not change the permanent character of the appellant\u2019s undertaking. Furthermore, to leave the interior waters in order to go from one point to another in the same province, as the appellant\u2019s boats must do to go from the City of Quebec to Gasp\u00e9, could not be considered as going beyond the limits of the province within the meaning of s. 92(10) of the B.N.A. Act and s. 53(c) of the Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act.\nAlthough the power given to Parliament by s. 91(10) of the B.N.A. Act had to be interpreted liberally, in a case such as the present one and excepting what concerned the navigation aspect, the provisions of s. 91(29) and s. 92(1) (a) and (b) have the collective effect of excluding from the jurisdiction of Parliament the maritime transport undertakings, the operations of which are carried out strictly within the same province. The right to strike and the right to bargain collectively as well as the determination of such matters as hours of work, rates of wages, working conditions and the like, are a vital part of the management and operation of any commercial or industrial undertaking. The power to regulate these matters in the case of an undertaking which falls within the legislative authority of Parliament lies with Parliament. The same principle applies to undertakings which fall within the legislative authority of the provinces. The statute which is sought to be applied to the appellant\u2014The Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act\u2014can only regulate undertakings which fall under the legislative authority of Parliament. This is not the case of the appellant. The trial judge was therefore justified in authorizing the issuance of the writ.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of C\u00f4t\u00e9 J.

Le jugement de la Cour fut rendu par\nLE JUGE FAUTEUX:\u2014L\u2019appelante se pourvoit contre un arr\u00eat majoritaire de la Cour d\u2019appel[2], qui infirme une d\u00e9cision de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure autorisant la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019un bref introductif d\u2019instance (847 C.P.C.) enjoignant aux intim\u00e9s de suspendre, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 jugement final sur le bref, toutes proc\u00e9dures relatives \u00e0 la tenue d\u2019un scrutin ordonn\u00e9 le 2 novembre 1966 par le Conseil canadien des relations ouvri\u00e8res et toutes proc\u00e9dures relatives \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de cette ordonnance.\nCet appel soul\u00e8ve deux points.\nLe premier consiste \u00e0 savoir si la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a un pouvoir de surveillance et de r\u00e9forme sur les proc\u00e9dures ou d\u00e9cisions du Conseil canadien,\u2014organisme qui rel\u00e8ve de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement et qui exerce des pouvoirs judiciaires ou quasi-judiciaires,\u2014et, dans l\u2019affirmative, si, en l\u2019absence de moyens prescrits pour faire appel \u00e0 ce pouvoir de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, les justiciables peuvent recourir \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure applicable dans le cas de tribunaux administratifs relevant de la comp\u00e9tence de la L\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec. Disposons imm\u00e9diatement de cette premi\u00e8re question en disant que cette Cour y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9pondu affirmativement dans une d\u00e9cision, rendue le 13 mai 1969, dans la cause de Three Rivers Boatman Ltd. v. Conseil canadien des relations ouvri\u00e8res, Roger L. Fournier, J. Lorne MacDougall et Syndicat international des marins canadiens[3].\nLa deuxi\u00e8me question est de savoir si, prima facie, le Conseil canadien a exc\u00e9d\u00e9 sa juridiction, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, en proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 exercer le pouvoir d\u2019accr\u00e9ditation que lui conf\u00e8re la premi\u00e8re partie de la Loi sur les relations industrielles et sur les enqu\u00eates visant les diff\u00e9rends du travail, S.R.C. 1952, c. 152, ci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9sign\u00e9e sous le titre abr\u00e9g\u00e9 de Loi sur les diff\u00e9rends du travail. Il nous faut donc rechercher si, comme en a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le Conseil canadien, la premi\u00e8re partie de ce statut s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019appelante ou, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, si cette entreprise entre dans l\u2019une des cat\u00e9gories d\u2019entreprises mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019art. 53 de la Loi sur les diff\u00e9rends du travail.\nA ces fins, les faits et les seuls faits dont il y a lieu de tenir compte sont ceux qu\u2019expose la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure par l\u2019appelante pour obtenir la d\u00e9livrance du bref introductif d\u2019instance. En effet, nous n\u2019avons pas \u00e0 nous pr\u00e9occuper des faits que le Conseil canadien a jug\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9s devant lui. Le Conseil canadien ne saurait, en effet, s\u2019attribuer une juridiction en m\u00e9sinterpr\u00e9tant ou ignorant la preuve qu\u2019on lui a soumise et c\u2019est l\u00e0 le fait qu\u2019on lui reproche \u00e0 la requ\u00eate et que nous devons, \u00e0 l\u2019instar des autres faits qui y sont all\u00e9gu\u00e9s, pr\u00e9sumer au stade pr\u00e9liminaire o\u00f9 en est cette requ\u00eate, ainsi que le veut la disposition du second alin\u00e9a de l\u2019art. 847 C.P.C. et ainsi, par ailleurs, qu\u2019en ont convenu les parties. R\u00e9sumons ces faits.\nConstitu\u00e9e suivant les lois de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et ayant sa principale place d\u2019affaires en la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, l\u2019appelante poss\u00e8de et exploite trois navires caboteurs dont Qu\u00e9bec est le port d\u2019attache. Ces navires n\u2019effectuent que le transport g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de marchandises et ce, seulement dans les limites et \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur des eaux de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, particuli\u00e8rement entre Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, les ports de la rive nord et les ports de la rive sud du Saint-Laurent. L\u2019appelante a, de plus, sept bureaux r\u00e9gionaux et installations portuaires, tous situ\u00e9s dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, soit dans les ports de Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Baie Comeau, Sept\u00celes, Matane, Ste-Anne-des-Monts et Gasp\u00e9. Elle ne fait aucun acheminement de fret (freight forwarding), ni ne s\u2019en occupe en dehors de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Ces navires n\u2019ont qu\u2019en trois circonstances pr\u00e8s, et ceci exceptionnellement et seulement dans le but de compl\u00e9ter des cargaisons, fait des voyages au-del\u00e0 des limites territoriales de la province, soit deux \u00e0 Toronto, aux cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1964, et un \u00e0 Pugwash, en Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse, au cours de 1965. Il n\u2019appert pas que les navires de l\u2019appelante soient sortis de la province en 1966.\nDisons incidemment qu\u2019on all\u00e8gue d\u2019autres faits dans la requ\u00eate. Ainsi, on all\u00e8gue qu\u2019un syndicat autre que le syndicat intim\u00e9, nomm\u00e9ment le District 50 United Mines Workers of America, unit\u00e9 locale 13946, est d\u00e9j\u00e0 et ce, depuis 1964, le repr\u00e9sentant, accr\u00e9dit\u00e9 par la Commission des relations ouvri\u00e8res de Qu\u00e9bec, du m\u00eame groupe de travailleurs dont le syndicat intim\u00e9 cherche \u00e0 se faire accr\u00e9diter comme repr\u00e9sentant par le Conseil canadien. Ce fait ajoute sans doute \u00e0 l\u2019importance de la question de juridiction soulev\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante, mais c\u2019est l\u00e0, cependant, un fait \u00e9tranger \u00e0 la solution de cette question. Il convient maintenant de reproduire les dispositions suivantes de l\u2019art. 53 de la Loi sur les diff\u00e9rends du travail.\n53. La Partie I s\u2019applique \u00e0. l\u2019\u00e9gard des travailleurs employ\u00e9s aux ouvrages, entreprises ou affaires qui rel\u00e8vent de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative du Parlement du Canada, ou relativement \u00e0 l\u2019exploitation de ces choses, y compris, mais non de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 restreindre la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de:\na) les ouvrages, entreprises ou affaires ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s ou exerc\u00e9s pour ou concernant la navigation et la marine marchande, int\u00e9rieures ou maritimes, y compris la mise en service de navires et le transport par navires partout au Canada;\nb) les chemins de fer, canaux, t\u00e9l\u00e9graphes et autres ouvrages et entreprises, reliant une province \u00e0 une ou plusieurs autres provinces, ou s\u2019\u00e9tendant au del\u00e0 des limites d\u2019une province;\nc) les lignes de vapeurs et autres navires reliant une province \u00e0 une ou plusieurs autres provinces, ou s\u2019\u00e9tendant au del\u00e0 des limites d\u2019une province;\nd) les bacs transbordeurs entre une province et une autre, ou entre une province et tout pays autre que le Canada;\ne) \u2026\nf) \u2026\ng) \u2026\nh) \u2026\net \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des patrons de ces travailleurs dans leurs rapports avec ces derniers, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des syndicats ouvriers et organisations patronales compos\u00e9s desdits travailleurs ou patrons.\nEn Cour sup\u00e9rieure, M. le juge C\u00f4t\u00e9, s\u2019appuyant principalement sur les diverses opinions exprim\u00e9es par les membres de cette Cour dans Validity and Applicability of the Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act, maintenant cit\u00e9e sous le titre abr\u00e9g\u00e9 de Eastern Canada Stevedoring Co. Ltd.[4], consid\u00e9ra que les all\u00e9gations de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019appelante suffisaient \u00e0 classer son entreprise comme entreprise de navigation intra-provinciale et jugea que, dans l\u2019\u00e9tat actuel du dossier et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019une preuve au contraire soit rapport\u00e9e, il y avait, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, une apparence de droit suffisante pour agr\u00e9er les conclusions de la requ\u00eate et permettre ainsi un d\u00e9bat entre les parties sur le fond du litige, tant en fait qu\u2019en droit. En cons\u00e9quence, il autorisa la d\u00e9livrance du bref introductif d\u2019instance et ordonna la suspension de toutes proc\u00e9dures relatives \u00e0 la tenue du scrutin ordonn\u00e9 par le Conseil canadien et la suspension de toutes proc\u00e9dures relatives \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de cette ordonnance. En Cour d\u2019appel[5], MM. les juges Taschereau et Owen exprim\u00e8rent l\u2019avis que le Conseil canadien n\u2019\u00e9tait pas soumis au pouvoir de surveillance et de r\u00e9forme de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et, pour cette raison, ne se sont pas prononc\u00e9s sur la question qui nous occupe. Dissident, M. le juge Choquette affirma, au contraire, la juridiction de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et jugea que, pris dans leur ensemble, les all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de la requ\u00eate en \u00e9vocation ne d\u00e9montrent pas que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance ait err\u00e9, ni en d\u00e9cidant que jusqu\u2019\u00e0 preuve du contraire l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait une affaire intra-provinciale, ni en autorisant la d\u00e9livrance du bref demand\u00e9 et ni en sursoyant aux proc\u00e9dures du Conseil canadien.\nAu regard des faits dont nous devons tenir compte \u00e0 ce stade pr\u00e9liminaire de la requ\u00eate en \u00e9vocation, il nous faut conclure que les op\u00e9rations maritimes de l\u2019appelante se limitent au territoire de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. On a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 mettre en doute cette conclusion de fait en soulevant deux moyens. On a d\u2019abord invoqu\u00e9 les trois voyages, effectu\u00e9s par les navires de l\u2019appelante, en dehors des limites de la province et on a, de plus, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 que, voyageant sur le fleuve Saint-Laurent pour se rendre de la ville de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 celle de Gasp\u00e9, les navires de l\u2019appelante doivent n\u00e9cessairement franchir les fronti\u00e8res des eaux int\u00e9rieures du Canada, suivant la d\u00e9finition donn\u00e9e \u00e0 cette expression dans et aux fins de la Loi sur la marine marchande, S.R.C. 1952, c. 29, art. 2(41).\nEn ce qui concerne le premier moyen, je dirais, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de M. le juge Choquette de la Cour d\u2019appel, que ce n\u2019est pas trois voyages effectu\u00e9s exceptionnellement au-del\u00e0 des limites de la province, soit deux en 1964 et un seul en 1965, qui suffisent \u00e0 changer le caract\u00e8re permanent de l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019appelante. Dans Re Tank Truck Transport Ltd.[6] et dans Regina v. Cooksville Magistrate\u2019s Court, Ex parte Liquid Cargo Lines Ltd.[7], d\u00e9cisions cit\u00e9es par le syndicat intim\u00e9 au soutien de ce premier moyen, les faits sont diff\u00e9rents. Dans la premi\u00e8re de ces causes, le voiturier d\u00e9tenait, pour le transport de marchandises, un permis de la province d\u2019Ontario, un permis du f\u00e9d\u00e9ral pour le transport de marchandi- ses entre l\u2019Ontario et le Qu\u00e9bec et un permis de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 concern\u00e9e aux \u00c9tats-Unis pour le transport d\u2019un certain produit d\u2019un point aux \u00c9tats-Unis \u00e0 un autre point au Canada. Bien que les divers voyages, en dehors des limites de la province d\u2019Ontario, n\u2019\u00e9taient pas effectu\u00e9s suivant un horaire arr\u00eat\u00e9, ils \u00e9taient raisonnablement r\u00e9guliers; ce qui n\u2019est pas le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. J\u2019ajouterai que cette d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame d\u2019Ontario, non seulement ne supporte pas la pr\u00e9tention du syndicat intim\u00e9 mais elle va pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019encontre, ainsi qu\u2019il appert du passage ci-apr\u00e8s \u00e0 la page 172 du recueil:\nI agree with counsel for the respondent that not every undertaking capable of connecting Provinces or capable of extending beyond the limits of a Province does so in fact. The words \u201cconnecting\u201d and \u201cextending\u201d in s. 92(10)(a) must be given some significance. For example a trucking company or a taxicab company taking goods or passengers occasionally and at irregular intervals from one Province to another could hardly be said to be an undertaking falling within s. 92(10)(a). As appears from the Winner case and the Underwater Gas Developers case, \u201cundertaking\u201d involves activity and I think that to connect or extend, that activity must be continuous and regular, but if the facts show that a particular undertaking is continuous and regular, as the undertaking is in this case, then it does in fact connect or extend and falls within the exception in 10(a) regardless of whether it is of greater or less in extent than that which is carried on within the Province.\nDans la seconde cause, le voiturier offrait et fournissait un service extra-provincial de fa\u00e7on constante et ininterrompue \u00e0 tous ceux qui en faisaient la demande.\nIl faut donc \u00e9carter ce premier moyen comme non fond\u00e9.\nEn ce qui concerne le second, bas\u00e9 sur la Loi sur la Marine marchande, je dirais que ce moyen ne peut \u00eatre soulev\u00e9 vu qu\u2019il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 sp\u00e9cifiquement dans la requ\u00eate que, sauf les trois voyages ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9s, les navires de l\u2019appelante naviguent dans les limites et \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur des eaux de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Je ne vois gu\u00e8re, par ailleurs, que ce soit aller au-del\u00e0 des limites de la province, au sens de l\u2019art. 92(10) de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord Britannique et de l\u2019art. 53(c) de la Loi sur les diff\u00e9rends du travail, que de sortir des eaux int\u00e9rieures pour aller d\u2019un point \u00e0 un autre dans la m\u00eame province.\nIl faut donc retenir qu\u2019au regard du dossier, tel que pr\u00e9sentement constitu\u00e9, les op\u00e9rations maritimes de l\u2019appelante sont des op\u00e9rations intra-provinciales. M\u00eame si tel est le cas, dit-on de la part des intim\u00e9s, ces op\u00e9rations rel\u00e8vent quand m\u00eame de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement en raison de l\u2019art. 91(10) (Navigation and Shipping) du statut de 1867 et sont assujetties \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du Conseil canadien en vertu du paragraphe d\u2019ouverture et de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (a) de l\u2019art. 53 de la Loi sur les diff\u00e9rends du travail. Cette assertion repose purement et simplement sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019on donne aux articles cit\u00e9s et aucunement sur un fait aff\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019appelante et susceptible de donner \u00e0 cette entreprise un aspect requ\u00e9rant une consid\u00e9ration particuli\u00e8re. On ne saurait accueillir l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e sans \u00eatre conduit \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019en \u00e9dictant les dispositions des art. 91(29) et 92(10)(a) du statut de 1867 et de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (c) de l\u2019art. 53 de la Loi sur les diff\u00e9rends du travail, le L\u00e9gislateur a parl\u00e9 pour ne rien dire. En ce qui concerne particuli\u00e8rement les dispositions de l\u2019art. 53, il me para\u00eet clair que l\u2019alin\u00e9a (c), visant les lignes de vapeurs et autres navires reliant une province \u00e0 une ou plusieurs autres provinces, ou s\u2019\u00e9tendant au-del\u00e0 des limites d\u2019une province, implique n\u00e9cessairement que les autres lignes ne sont pas vis\u00e9es. Il faut en conclure que lorsque dans l\u2019alin\u00e9a (a) du m\u00eame article on mentionne la navigation et transport par navires, on ne vise pas ce qui se trouve implicitement exclu par la disposition de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (c). En somme et si lib\u00e9ralement que doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 le pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au Parlement par l\u2019art. 91(10) du statut de 1867, ainsi qu\u2019en a jug\u00e9 le comit\u00e9 judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans City of Montreal v. Montreal Harbour Commissioners[8], je suis d\u2019avis que dans un cas comme celui qui nous occupe et sauf en ce qui concerne l\u2019aspect navigation, les dispositions des art. 91(29) et 92(10)(a) et (b) ont collectivement pour effet d\u2019exclure de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement les entreprises de transport maritime dont les op\u00e9rations sont effectu\u00e9es strictement \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur d\u2019une m\u00eame province. Dans Commission du salaire minimum v. Bell Telephone Co. of Canada[9], cette Cour a unanimement approuv\u00e9 le principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 comme suit par mon coll\u00e8gue, M. le juge Abbott, dans le renvoi touchant la validit\u00e9 de la loi qui r\u00e9git le Conseil canadien[10]:\nThe right to strike and the right to bargain collectively are now generally recognized, and the determination of such matters as hours of work, rates of wages, working conditions and the like, is in my opinion a vital part of the management and operation of any commercial or industrial undertaking. This being so, the power to regulate such matters, in the case of undertakings which fall within the legislative authority of Parliament lies with Parliament and not with the Provincial Legislatures.\nCela implique \u00e9videmment qu\u2019en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale c\u2019est la l\u00e9gislation provinciale qu\u2019il faut appliquer en ces mati\u00e8res aux entreprises du ressort l\u00e9gislatif des provinces. Il reste \u00e9videmment certaines exceptions \u00e0 faire sp\u00e9cialement pour ce qu\u2019il faut consid\u00e9rer comme relevant de l\u2019aspect navigation. Il n\u2019est s\u00fbrement pas \u00e0 propos d\u2019entreprendre de d\u00e9finir l\u2019\u00e9tendue du champ d\u2019application de ces exceptions, il suffit de dire que cela ne saurait s\u2019\u00e9tendre \u00e0 la mati\u00e8re qui nous concerne: la loi qu\u2019on a voulu appliquer \u00e0 l\u2019appelante ne peut r\u00e9gir que les entreprises qui sont du ressort du Parlement. Tel n\u2019\u00e9tant pas le cas de l\u2019appelante, elle ne peut y \u00eatre assujettie.\nCes consid\u00e9rations me paraissent suffisantes pour conclure que dans l\u2019\u00e9tat actuel du dossier, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 d\u2019autoriser la d\u00e9livrance du bref demand\u00e9 et de surseoir aux proc\u00e9dures du Conseil canadien.\nJe ferais droit au pourvoi de l\u2019appelante, infirmerais le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel et r\u00e9tablirais le dispositif du jugement de premi\u00e8re instance; le tout avec d\u00e9pens en cette Cour et en Cour d\u2019appel.\nAppel accueilli avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelante: Byers, McDougall, Casgrain & Stewart, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs des intim\u00e9s, le Conseil, R.L.

La r\u00e9clamation porte sur les dommages d\u00e9coulant du d\u00e9c\u00e8s en vertu de l\u2019art. 1056 du Code Civil aussi bien que ceux dus aux h\u00e9ritiers en vertu de l\u2019art. 1053. Plus d\u2019un an apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son mari, la demanderesse a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate demandant la permission d\u2019amender le bref et la d\u00e9claration pour joindre comme d\u00e9fendeur solidaire un nomm\u00e9 Lampron qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9tendument le fournisseur de la cuisini\u00e8re \u00e0 gaz dont l\u2019explosion a provoqu\u00e9 l\u2019incendie. La requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e en Cour sup\u00e9rieure pour le motif qu\u2019il y avait prescription. La Cour d\u2019appel a modifi\u00e9 ce jugement en permettant l\u2019amendement \u00e0 seule fin d\u2019exercer la r\u00e9clamation en vertu de l\u2019art. 1053 C.C. La demanderesse a obtenu la permission d\u2019appeler \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre accueilli.\nVu l\u2019\u00e9tat de la jurisprudence et vu que l\u2019amendement dont il s\u2019agit est susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre attaqu\u00e9 par d\u2019autres moyens, il semble plus sage de s\u2019abstenir d\u2019\u00e9mettre une opinion sur toute cause \u00e9ventuelle de d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du droit d\u2019action, avant l\u2019amendement m\u00eame. La requ\u00eate de la demanderesse pour amender le bref et la d\u00e9claration doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9e.\nPrescription\u2014Claim in damages based on art. 1053 and 1056 of the Civil Code\u2014Death in fire of hotel\u2014Motion to amend writ and declaration to summon joint and several defendant\u2014Whether interruption of prescription applies to claim arising from the death\u2014Civil Code, art. 1053, 1056, 1106, 2188, 2224, 2231, 2262\u2014Code of Civil Procedure, art. 202.\nFollowing the death of her husband in the fire that destroyed an hotel owned by the defendant, the plaintiff, personally and as tutrix of her children, claimed damages from the defendant. The claim was for damages resulting from the death under art. 1056 as well as for damages due to the heirs under art. 1053. More than one year after her husband\u2019s death, the plaintiff moved to amend the writ and the declaration to include as a joint and several defendant one Lampron who allegedly had supplied the gas stove, the explosion of which had provoked the fire. The motion was dismissed by the Superior Court on the basis that there was prescription. The Court of Appeal varied the judgment by allowing the amendment only with respect to the claim based on art. 1053 C.C. The plaintiff was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nIn view of the authorities and of the fact that the amendment in question may be contested by other means, it seems preferable to abstain from giving an opinion on a possible cause of loss of the right of action, before the amendment is made. The plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend the writ and the declaration should be allowed.\nAPPEAL from a judgement of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], varying a judgment of Beaudoin J. Appeal allowed.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec1, modifiant un jugement du Juge Beaudoin. Appel accueilli.\nGilles Duguay, pour la demanderesse, appelante.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur, intim\u00e9, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audition.\nLe jugement de la Cour fut rendu par\nLE JUGE PIGEON:\u2014A la suite du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son mari dans un incendie, l\u2019appelante a intent\u00e9 contre l\u2019intim\u00e9 une action en responsabilit\u00e9. Agissant \u00e9galement comme tutrice de ses enfants, elle r\u00e9clame pour elle et pour eux $50,400 \u00e0 titre de dommages d\u00e9coulant du d\u00e9c\u00e8s et $1,600 qui leur seraient dus comme h\u00e9ritiers du d\u00e9funt pour frais fun\u00e9raires et effets personnels d\u00e9truits dans l\u2019incendie.\nA cette action intent\u00e9e contre le propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019immeuble incendi\u00e9, elle a, subs\u00e9quemment voulu joindre comme d\u00e9fendeur un nomm\u00e9 Valmore Lampron qui serait le fournisseur de la cuisini\u00e8re \u00e0 gaz propane dont l\u2019explosion a provoqu\u00e9 l\u2019incendie. Dans ce but elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure une requ\u00eate demandant la permission d\u2019amender le bref et la d\u00e9claration pour all\u00e9guer les fautes qu\u2019elle reproche au nomm\u00e9 Lampron et conclure \u00e0 une condamnation solidaire contre les deux d\u00e9fendeurs.\nSelon la pratique au Qu\u00e9bec, l\u2019avis de cette requ\u00eate n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 qu\u2019au d\u00e9fendeur d\u00e9j\u00e0 poursuivi, l\u2019intim\u00e9 Marineau, et non pas au nouveau d\u00e9fendeur que l\u2019appelante d\u00e9sire assigner. Apr\u00e8s audition des procureurs des deux parties, la requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par les motifs suivants:\nCONSID\u00c9RANT qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019encontre de ladite requ\u00eate, on a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au tribunal que la demanderesse n\u2019\u00e9tait plus dans les d\u00e9lais pour poursuivre ledit Lampron vu qu\u2019il y avait prescription;\nCONSID\u00c9RANT qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019article 4 de sa d\u00e9claration, la demanderesse all\u00e8gue que son \u00e9poux est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 22 septembre 1964;\nCONSID\u00c9RANT que la demanderesse, dans son action, poursuivait tant en vertu de l\u2019article 1053 du code civil qu\u2019en vertu de l\u2019article 1056 et que dans ce dernier cas, elle devait poursuivre pendant l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00e0 compter du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son \u00e9poux;\nEn appel[2], ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 par un arr\u00eat permettant l\u2019amendement \u00e0 seule fin d\u2019exercer la r\u00e9clamation de $1,600 \u00e0 titre d\u2019h\u00e9ritiers du d\u00e9funt. On admet que l\u2019appelante est recevable \u00e0 soutenir qu\u2019il y a eu interruption de la prescription par l\u2019assignation de l\u2019un de ceux qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9tend \u00eatre ses d\u00e9biteurs solidaires. Cependant, on d\u00e9cide que l\u2019interruption de prescription pr\u00e9vue aux art. 2224 et 2231 du Code civil ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 la prescription ou d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1056 auquel renvoie le para. 2 de l\u2019art. 2262. Citant ce que le Conseil Priv\u00e9 a dit de ces deux derniers articles dans Robinson c. C.P.R.[3], le juge Montgomery, dissident, aurait repouss\u00e9 cette distinction et admis la requ\u00eate pour le tout. Cette derni\u00e8re opinion m\u00e9rite s\u00fbrement d\u2019\u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e attentivement car notre Cour semble, dans Grand Trunk Railway et Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al c. McDonald[4], avoir admis l\u2019interruption de prescription tant \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par 1056 C.C. que de celui qui est pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 la charte de la ville de Montr\u00e9al.\nCependant, avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et ceux de la Cour d\u2019appel, il para\u00eet clair qu\u2019il vaut beaucoup mieux en la pr\u00e9sente cause adopter la m\u00eame attitude que la Cour d\u2019appel dans Coupal c. Crispino[5]. On a infirm\u00e9 un jugement refusant de permettre un amendement parce que le droit d\u2019action \u00e9tait \u00e9teint par prescription, le regrett\u00e9 juge Bissonnette disant (\u00e0 p. 192):\ncomme cet amendement est susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre attaqu\u00e9 par d\u2019autres moyens, il semble plus sage de s\u2019abstenir d\u2019\u00e9mettre une opinion sur toute cause \u00e9ventuelle de d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du droit d\u2019action, avant l\u2019amendement m\u00eame.\nIl faut bien songer que lorsqu\u2019un amendement est ainsi refus\u00e9, le demandeur peut se pourvoir en appel. Alors on risque qu\u2019il se trouve, comme dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, \u00e0 compara\u00eetre seul devant le tribunal, le premier d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019ayant aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 prendre le risque de demander le rejet d\u2019un appel o\u00f9 ce n\u2019est pas lui mais celui qu\u2019on n\u2019a pas encore assign\u00e9 qui est r\u00e9ellement vis\u00e9. Le demandeur se voit donc oblig\u00e9 de subir les frais d\u2019un appel \u00e0 seule fin de faire d\u00e9cider qu\u2019on ne doit pas trancher la question de prescription.\nIl est bien vrai que l\u2019art. 2188 C.C. permet aux tribunaux de suppl\u00e9er d\u2019office le moyen r\u00e9sultant de la prescription dans les cas o\u00f9 la loi d\u00e9nie l\u2019action. Cela ne veut pas n\u00e9cessairement dire qu\u2019ils doivent le faire avant m\u00eame que le d\u00e9fendeur soit assign\u00e9. Au surplus, si les r\u00e8gles du titre de la prescription ne s\u2019appliquent pas en l\u2019occurrence, peut-on se fonder sur celle-l\u00e0 pour le d\u00e9cider?\nPour ces raisons je conclus qu\u2019il faut infirmer le jugement de la Cour d\u2019Appel et r\u00e9former le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure aux fins de permettre l\u2019amendement du bref et de la d\u00e9claration suivant la requ\u00eate de la demanderesse appelante. Quant aux d\u00e9pens de l\u2019incident et ceux des appels, il me para\u00eet que dans les circonstances il faut r\u00e9server au juge du fond le soin de les adjuger.\nAppel accueilli.\nProcureurs de la demanderesse, appelante: Duguay, Salois & Boyer, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs du d\u00e9fendeur, intim\u00e9: L\u00e9tourneau, Stein, Marseille, Bienvenue, Delisle & Larue, Qu\u00e9bec, et Boulet & Venne, Grand\u2019M\u00e8re.\n[1] [1969] B.R. 11.\n[2] [1969] B.R. 11.\n[3] [1892] A.C. 481.\n[4] (1918), 57 R.C.S. 268.\n[5] [1965] B.R. 189.",

Les demandeurs sont la veuve et les enfants d\u2019un passager b\u00e9n\u00e9vole d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 lorsque le v\u00e9hicule dans lequel il se trouvait, appartenant \u00e0 un nomm\u00e9 Roy et conduit par lui, entra en collision avec une autre automobile. Roy et son passager \u00e9taient tous deux \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de la d\u00e9fenderesse. Roy, qui lui aussi a \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e9, faisait un voyage pour le compte de la d\u00e9fenderesse, mais son passager voyageait pour ses fins personnelles \u00e0 la connaissance de la d\u00e9fenderesse. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a imput\u00e9 l\u2019accident enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 la faute de Roy et il a condamn\u00e9 la d\u00e9fenderesse solidairement avec les h\u00e9ritiers de Roy, tant sur la poursuite de l\u2019autre automobiliste que sur celle des demandeurs. La Cour d\u2019appel a confirm\u00e9 la condamnation contre la d\u00e9fenderesse en faveur de l\u2019autre automobiliste mais elle a infirm\u00e9 celle qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e contre elle en faveur des demandeurs.

La d\u00e9fenderesse n\u2019a pas interjet\u00e9 appel de la d\u00e9cision en faveur de l\u2019autre automobiliste.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nL\u2019article 1054 du Code Civil ne d\u00e9cr\u00e8te la responsabilit\u00e9 des ma\u00eetres et commettants qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard \u00abdu dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs domestiques et ouvriers dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles\u00bb ils sont employ\u00e9s. A l\u2019\u00e9gard des autres usagers de la route Roy \u00e9tait \u00abdans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles\u00bb il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9. Mais tel n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le cas lorsque Roy transportait son compagnon de travail. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait aucunement charg\u00e9 par son employeur de cette mission. C\u2019est lui seul qui \u00e0 titre personnel et non comme pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le faisait non dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de son employeur mais dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat exclusif de son compagnon de travail qui se d\u00e9pla\u00e7ait pour ses affaires personnelles. L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation stricte des mots \u00abdans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions\u00bb implique une distinction entre les actes faits dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions et les actes qui sont seulement accomplis \u00e0 l\u2019occasion des fonctions ou qui ne s\u2019y rattachent que par des circonstances de temps, de lieu et de service.\nMaster and servant\u2014Automobile\u2014Collision\u2014Employee driving his own vehicle in the performance of his duties\u2014Fellow-worker travelling as a gratuitous passenger for personal matters\u2014Liability of employer towards other users of the road but not towards the gratuitous passenger\u2014Civil Code, art. 1053, 1054.\nThe plaintiffs are the widow and the children of a gratuitous passenger killed when a vehicle in which he had taken place and which was owned and driven by one Roy, collided with another automobile. Roy and his passenger were both employed by the defendant. Roy, who was also killed, was travelling in the execution of his duties, but his passenger was travelling on personal matters with the knowledge of the defendant. On the actions taken by both the driver of the other automobile and the plaintiffs, the trial judge found that the accident was wholly attributable to the fault of Roy and held the defendant jointly and severally liable with Roy\u2019s heirs. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment against the defendant in favour of the driver of the other automobile but set aside the one pronounced against the defendant in favour of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court. The defendant did not appeal against the decision in favour of the driver of the other automobile. Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\nArticle 1054 of the Civil Code enacts that the masters and employers are responsible only for the \u201cdamage caused by their servants and workmen in the performance of the work for which they are employed\u201d. With respect to the other users of the road Roy was \u201cin the performance of the work for which\u201d he was employed. But such was not the case when Roy gave a ride to his fellow-worker. He was not performing this service for his employer. He was doing it in his personal capacity and not as a servant of the defendant. He was not acting in the interest of his employer but in the exclusive interest of his fellow-worker who was travelling on personal matters. Strictly construed, the words \u201cin the performance of the work\u201d imply a distinction between what is done in the performance of the work and what is done only on the occasion of the work or is connected with the work only by circumstances of time, location and service.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen;s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], reversing as to the appellants only a judgment of Mayrand J. Appeal dismissed.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec1, infirmant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des appelants seulement un jugement du Jug\u00e9 Mayrand. Appel rejet\u00e9.\nMarcel Cinq-Mars, c.r., pour les demandeurs, appelants.\nA.J. Campbell, c.r., pour la d\u00e9fenderesse, intim\u00e9e.\nLe jugement de la Cour fut rendu par\nLE JUGE PIGEON:\u2014Les appelants sont la veuve et les enfants d\u2019Edmond Bonenfant qui a trouv\u00e9 la mort dans une collision d\u2019automobiles alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait passager b\u00e9n\u00e9vole dans la voiture d\u2019un nomm\u00e9 Ren\u00e9 Roy. Celui-ci, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps, \u00e9tait acheteur au service de plusieurs soci\u00e9t\u00e9s. Lors de l\u2019accident il faisait un voyage pour le compte de l\u2019une d\u2019elles, l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il \u00e9tait en route de Solbec vers Val d\u2019Or en passant par Montr\u00e9al o\u00f9 il se proposait d\u2019arr\u00eater prendre son \u00e9pouse et sa fille. Edmond Bonenfant qui \u00e9tait au service du m\u00eame employeur lui avait demand\u00e9 de l\u2019emmener jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Montr\u00e9al d\u2019o\u00f9 il se proposait de continuer jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Peterborough pour une visite \u00e0 sa famille. Ren\u00e9 Roy y avait consenti \u00e0 la connaissance de leur employeur commun. Ayant entendu simultan\u00e9ment des poursuites dirig\u00e9es \u00e0 la fois contre les h\u00e9ritiers de Ren\u00e9 Roy et ses employeurs, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a jug\u00e9 l\u2019accident enti\u00e8rement imputable \u00e0 sa faute et condamn\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e solidairement avec les h\u00e9ritiers tant sur la poursuite de l\u2019autre automobiliste que sur celle des appelants.\nAu contraire, la Cour d\u2019appel laissant subsister la condamnation contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e en faveur de l\u2019autre automobiliste, a infirm\u00e9 celle qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e contre elle en faveur des appelants.\nL\u2019appel devant nous ne soul\u00e8ve qu\u2019une seule question, savoir: Cette distinction est-elle justifi\u00e9e? En effet, l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne nie pas maintenant qu\u2019elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 bon droit condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 indemniser l\u2019autre automobiliste. Elle admet qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des autres usagers de la route Ren\u00e9 Roy conduisant sa propre voiture \u00e9tait, en l\u2019occurrence, \u00abdans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles\u00bb il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9. Elle nie cependant qu\u2019il en ait \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019Edmond Bonenfant parce que celui-ci \u00e9tait passager b\u00e9n\u00e9vole dans la voiture pour ses fins personnelles. Par cons\u00e9quent, dit-elle, Ren\u00e9 Roy agissait en dehors de ses fonctions en transportant b\u00e9n\u00e9volement un compagnon de travail puisque ses fonctions ne consistaient pas \u00e0 faire pareil transport.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance a refus\u00e9 de suivre la jurisprudence des tribunaux du Qu\u00e9bec sur ce point y compris deux arr\u00eats r\u00e9cents de la Cour d\u2019appel. Son motif est le suivant:\nLa relation de commettant \u00e0 pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 r\u00e9sulte d\u2019un \u00e9tat de fait, de relations entre ces deux personnes et ne d\u00e9pend pas des rapports que l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre peut avoir \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une tierce personne.\nAu contraire, en Cour d\u2019appel, le juge en chef a dit:\nA mon avis, rien ne s\u2019oppose \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne agisse dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de plusieurs fonctions en m\u00eame temps. Lors de l\u2019accident, Roy ex\u00e9cutait son mandat envers Solbec, mais il agissait aussi en son nom personnel en voiturant Bonenfant. Quant aux tiers, ils pouvaient choisir celle des fonctions qui leur \u00e9tait plus avantageuse. Key pouvait consid\u00e9rer Roy comme voiturant Bonenfant et agissant en son nom personnel ou comme ex\u00e9cutant son mandat envers Solbec et engageant la responsabilit\u00e9 de celle-ci. Quant \u00e0 Bonenfant, il ne peut consid\u00e9rer Roy que comme celui qui le transporte.\n...\nSi l\u2019accident \u00e9tait survenu au cours du trajet entre East Sullivan et Montr\u00e9al, aurait-il fallu tenir Solbec responsable des dommages qu\u2019auraient pu subir l\u2019\u00e9pouse et la fille de Roy? Il me r\u00e9pugnerait d\u2019en venir \u00e0 cette conclusion. Tant que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada ne se prononcera pas en sens contraire, je suivrai la jurisprudence \u00e9tablie dans les d\u00e9cisions cit\u00e9es.\nCe dernier raisonnement semble pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable. Comme les juges Anglin et Mignault l\u2019ont fait observer dans Curley c. Latreille[2], l\u2019art. 1054 du Code Civil du Qu\u00e9bec ne d\u00e9cr\u00e8te la responsabilit\u00e9 des ma\u00eetres et commettants qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard \u00abdu dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs domestiques et ouvriers dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles\u00bb ils sont employ\u00e9s, en anglais, \u00abfor the damage caused by their servants and workmen in the performance of the work for which they are employed\u00bb. Sous le Code Napol\u00e9on o\u00f9 Ton dit seulement \u00abdans les fonctions\u00bb, on a pu croire que cette expression vise m\u00eame les faits accomplis \u00ab\u00e0 l\u2019occasion de\u00bb l\u2019exercice des fonctions (Beaudry-Lacantinerie & Barde, Obligations, T.4, no. 1274), ou bien qu\u2019il suffit que l\u2019acte dommageable se rattache aux fonctions \u00abpar des circonstances de temps, de lieu et de service\u00bb (D.P. 74.2.52). Sous le Code du Qu\u00e9bec, cela n\u2019est pas possible.\nDans Vaillancourt c. La Compagnie de la Baie d\u2019Hudson[3], cette Cour a admis que l\u2019exercice abusif des fonctions reste dans le cadre de leur ex\u00e9cution au sens de l\u2019article. Cela ne signifie pas qu\u2019il soit possible d\u2019appliquer le texte en dehors de ce cadre, savoir l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles l\u2019auteur du dommage est employ\u00e9. Il me semble clair que ce n\u2019est pas \u00abdans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions\u00bb auxquelles il \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 que Ren\u00e9 Roy transportait son compagnon de travail. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait aucunement charg\u00e9 par son employeur de cette mission. C\u2019est lui seul qui \u00e0 titre personnel et non comme pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le faisait non dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de son employeur mais dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat exclusif de son compagnon de travail. En effet, celui-ci ne se d\u00e9pla\u00e7ait pas pour les affaires de son employeur mais pour ses affaires personnelles.\nOn ne peut nier que par des circonstances de temps, de lieu et de service le transport se. rattachait aux fonctions de Ren\u00e9 Roy, mais cela ne suffit pas pour qu\u2019il y ait responsabilit\u00e9. L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation stricte des mots \u00abdans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions\u00bb \u00e0 laquelle notre Cour s\u2019est arr\u00eat\u00e9e dans Curley c. Latreille implique une distinction entre les actes faits dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions et les actes qui sont seulement accomplis \u00e0 l\u2019occasion des fonctions ou qui ne s\u2019y rattachent que par des circonstances de temps, de lieu et de service. Ces deux possibilit\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9es et rejet\u00e9es d\u00e9finitivement par cet arr\u00eat.\nIl semble d\u2019ailleurs que Ton n\u2019en viendrait pas \u00e0 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente en suivant la derni\u00e8re interpr\u00e9tation adopt\u00e9e par la Cour de Cassation dans l\u2019arr\u00eat des Chambres R\u00e9unies du 9 mars 1960 (\u00c9poux Biehner c. Huret\u2014D. 1960.329), savoir qu\u2019il faut rechercher s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un \u00abacte ind\u00e9pendant du rapport de pr\u00e9position\u00bb. Evidemment, il ne s\u2019agit pas ici comme dans cette affaire-l\u00e0, d\u2019un acte accompli contre le gr\u00e9 de l\u2019employeur ni \u00e0 son insu, toutefois il est bien s\u00fbr que ni la connaissance, ni m\u00eame l\u2019assentiment du patron ne peuvent avoir pour effet de faire entrer dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions un acte qui en est ind\u00e9pendant.\nLes appelants, tout comme le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, objectent que le d\u00e9placement de Ren\u00e9 Roy en automobile \u00e9tait en l\u2019occurrence fait dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions d\u2019acheteur. Il leur para\u00eet illogique qu\u2019un m\u00eame acte, savoir la fausse man\u0153uvre cause de l\u2019accident, soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme accompli dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un autre automobiliste et non \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du passager b\u00e9n\u00e9vole. La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette objection c\u2019est que la question cruciale qu\u2019il faut se poser est la suivante: le dommage dont il s\u2019agit a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des fonctions? A l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019autre automobiliste, la r\u00e9ponse doit \u00eatre affirmative puisque Ren\u00e9 Roy l\u2019a caus\u00e9 en faisant un voyage qu\u2019il avait mission de faire. A l\u2019\u00e9gard du compagnon d\u2019infortune et de ses d\u00e9pendants, la r\u00e9ponse doit, au contraire, \u00eatre n\u00e9gative parce que le dommage a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 non pas dans l\u2019accomplissement de la mission confi\u00e9e par l\u2019employeur mais en rendant un service personnel pour des fins personnelles et non celles de l\u2019employeur.\nPour ces motifs, je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs des demandeurs, appelants: Cinq-Mars, Grimard et B\u00e9langer, Rouyn.\nProcureurs de la d\u00e9fenderesse, intim\u00e9e: Brais, Campbell, Pepper, Durand, Riopel et Laffoley, Montr\u00e9al.\n[1] [1968] B.R. 846.\n[2] (1920), 60 R.C.S. 131, 55 D.L.R. 461.\n[3] [1923] R.C.S. 414, [1923] 2 D.L.R. 1008.",

Il signa une renonciation au droit d\u2019appel. De 1964 \u00e0 1967, il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 plusieurs requ\u00eates pour faire rejeter l\u2019ordonnance de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive. Finalement, en 1967, il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de bref d\u2019habeas corpus avec certiorari auxiliaire, qui fut rejet\u00e9e par le juge en chef Wilson. Le principal moyen dont l\u2019appelant a fait \u00e9tat est qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u un avis de sept jours francs de la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019art. 661(1) du Code criminel, et que par cons\u00e9quent le magistrat n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019audition.\nA l\u2019audition devant le magistrat, l\u2019appelant a admis avoir eu signification de l\u2019avis \u00e9crit, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit comme pi\u00e8ce au dossier, mais on ne trouve pas la moindre allusion \u00e0 la date de cette signification. La pi\u00e8ce a \u00e9t\u00e9 perdue. L\u2019appelant a produit une longue d\u00e9claration sous serment. Cette d\u00e9claration consiste en grande partie en une argumentation, dans laquelle il tire la conclusion que l\u2019avis n\u2019a pas pu \u00eatre signifi\u00e9 sept jours francs avant l\u2019audition. Cette d\u00e9claration ne sp\u00e9cifie ni o\u00f9, ni quand l\u2019avis lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9. Dans leurs d\u00e9clarations sous serment, le magistrat et le substitut du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral affirment qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019audition on a prouv\u00e9 \u00e0 la satisfaction du magistrat que l\u2019appelant avait re\u00e7u un avis de sept jours francs. La d\u00e9claration sous serment du constable qui a signifi\u00e9 l\u2019avis affirme qu\u2019il croit avoir respect\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai. Par un jugement majoritaire, la Cour d\u2019appel a confirm\u00e9 de refus de la demande du bref. L\u2019appelant en a appel\u00e9 \u00e0 cette Cour et par la suite a obtenu la permission d\u2019appeler du recours par voie de certiorari.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, le Juge en Chef Cartwright et les Juges Hall, Spence et Pigeon \u00e9tant dissidents.\nLes Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson et Ritchie: L\u2019article 682(b) du Code criminel s\u2019applique aux circonstances de l\u2019affaire et emp\u00eache d\u2019\u00e9carter l\u2019ordonnance du magistrat par voie de certiorari. Si l\u2019on peut dire que les mots \u00abque l\u2019affaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e au fond\u00bb dans l\u2019art. 682(b) ne s\u2019appliquent que dans les cas o\u00f9 la Cour a juridiction, l\u2019article n\u2019a pas de sens. Le bref de certiorari porte principalement sur la question de la comp\u00e9tence du tribunal inf\u00e9rieur. On a voulu que l\u2019article s\u2019applique, et il s\u2019applique de fait \u00e0 cause de ses termes, aux cas o\u00f9 s\u2019il n\u2019existait pas, la comp\u00e9tence du tribunal pourrait \u00eatre contest\u00e9e par voie de certiorari. L\u2019article vise \u00e0 emp\u00eacher la coexistence de deux recours. Par ses termes, il s\u2019applique dans tous les cas qui tombent sous le coup de ses dispositions, \u00e0 toute tentative de faire r\u00e9former une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 ou une ordonnance par voie de certiorari. Cette opinion ne va pas \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019arr\u00eat de cette Cour dans l\u2019affaire Smith c. R., [1959] R.C.S. 638.\nIl n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e, savoir si, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des dispositions de l\u2019art. 691 du Code criminel, cette Cour a juridiction pour accueillir l\u2019appel du jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel refusant le certiorari.\nLa mention que l\u2019accus\u00e9 avait re\u00e7u un avis de sept jours francs de la demande n\u2019est pas une exigence n\u00e9cessaire du mandat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t.\nM\u00eame en admettant que l\u2019art. 682(b) n\u2019emp\u00eache pas de proc\u00e9der par voie de certiorari, l\u2019appel n\u2019est pas recevable au fond. A la lumi\u00e8re des faits, il incombait \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, lors de sa demande de bref de certiorari, fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019insuffisance de l\u2019avis, d\u2019\u00e9tablir le fait par une preuve positive et certaine. Il ne s\u2019est pas d\u00e9charg\u00e9 de ce fardeau.\nLe Juge en Chef Cartwright et les Juges Hall et Spence, dissidents: L\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u un avis de sept jours francs ainsi que l\u2019exige l\u2019art. 662(1)(b) du Code, le magistrat \u00e9tait incomp\u00e9tent ab initio et le mandat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t doit \u00eatre tenu pour invalide. La Cour peut en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce rechercher si l\u2019avis requis a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9. L\u2019article 682(b) du Code ne prive pas effectivement les tribunaux du pouvoir d\u2019accorder le certiorari en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. L\u2019opinion pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante est fortement \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019art. 682 ne fait pas obstacle au certiorari lorsque les proc\u00e9dures qu\u2019on veut con- tester sont nulles ab initio. En cons\u00e9quence, les tribunaux de premi\u00e8re instance et d\u2019appel avaient le droit d\u2019examiner le dossier afin de d\u00e9terminer si le magistrat \u00e9tait sans comp\u00e9tence ab initio, et cette Cour a le m\u00eame droit et le m\u00eame devoir.\nSi la question \u00e9tait res integra, la conclusion serait la m\u00eame. Cette cause n\u2019est pas vis\u00e9e par la teneur litt\u00e9rale de l\u2019art. 682, car l\u2019art. 661 ne pr\u00e9voit pas que la personne soit appel\u00e9e \u00e0 formuler un plaidoyer. De plus, on ne peut pas dire que \u00abl\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e au fond\u00bb si en fait et en droit le magistrat n\u2019avait pas acquis la comp\u00e9tence n\u00e9cessaire pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019audition. A d\u00e9faut de l\u2019avis requis, le d\u00e9bat devant le magistrat ne consistait pas un proc\u00e8s mais une nullit\u00e9.\nLe mandat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e9tait d\u00e9fectueux parce qu\u2019il indique que l\u2019ordonnance a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue par un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur mais ne fait pas voir que l\u2019avis imp\u00e9rieusement prescrit par l\u2019art. 662(1)(b) comme condition pr\u00e9alable du droit pour le magistrat d\u2019entendre la demande ait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant ni qu\u2019on en ait produit une copie comme cela est exig\u00e9. Lorsqu\u2019il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9, comme dans cette cause, qu\u2019une condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019acquisition par le tribunal inf\u00e9rieur de la comp\u00e9tence n\u00e9cessaire pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019audition n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie et que le mandat est muet sur ce point, l\u2019art. 61 de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame offre un moyen rapide de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019all\u00e9gation est bien fond\u00e9e.\nLa conclusion de la majorit\u00e9 en Cour d\u2019appel, \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019avis requis a effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant sept jours francs avant l\u2019audition ne peut pas \u00eatre retenue. On ne peut pas dire que l\u2019appelant a le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer ce qui devrait \u00eatre au dossier.\nLe Juge Hall, dissident: L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation selon laquelle l\u2019art. 682 du Code refuse le droit de faire \u00e9carter l\u2019ordonnance \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 dire qu\u2019une personne trouv\u00e9e coupable par suite d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure entach\u00e9e de nullit\u00e9 n\u2019a pas de recours par voie de certiorari si un appel aurait pu \u00eatre interjet\u00e9. L\u2019article n\u2019entra\u00eene pas cette conclusion. Lorsque le l\u00e9gislateur a dit \u00ablorsque le d\u00e9fendeur a comparu et plaid\u00e9, et que l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e \u00e0 fond\u00bb il entendait dire un proc\u00e8s ou une audition r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, non une proc\u00e9dure nulle au point de vue juridique. Les termes employ\u00e9s dans l\u2019art. 682 sont tr\u00e8s explicites, mais ils ne sont pas plus explicites, ni n\u2019ont un sens plus large que ceux qu\u2019on trouve dans bien des lois qui renferment des dispositions privatives dont la loi Labour Relations Act d\u2019Ontario est un exemple. Il ne serait pas logique de pr\u00e9tendre que l\u2019art. 682 constitue un obstacle absolu au certiorari dans une cause o\u00f9 la libert\u00e9 humaine est en jeu quand on ne consid\u00e8re pas que les dispositions tout aussi explicites \u00e0 l\u2019effet de supprimer ce recours dans les lois r\u00e9gissant les relations de travail peuvent avoir cet effet. Il faut n\u00e9cessairement conclure que s\u2019il y a eu d\u00e9faut de comp\u00e9tence, il ne peut y avoir eu de jugement au fond au sens de l\u2019art. 682.\nLe Juge Pigeon, dissident: Les proc\u00e9dures relatives \u00e0 une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive constituent une instance distincte de l\u2019inculpation \u00e0 la suite de laquelle on les intente. On ne peut appliquer l\u2019art. 682(b) du Code \u00e0 une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive alors que la proc\u00e9dure sur la demande d\u2019une telle sentence ne pr\u00e9voit pas que l\u2019inculp\u00e9 soit appel\u00e9 \u00e0 plaider. L\u2019appelant est dans la m\u00eame situation que dans Smith c. La Reine, [1959] R.C.S. 638, il n\u2019a pas plaid\u00e9. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019appelant a droit au certiorari.\nLe dossier d\u00e9montre que, devant le magistrat on n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019un avis de sept jours francs avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 comme l\u2019exige imp\u00e9rativement l\u2019art. 662 du Code. M\u00eame si l\u2019appelant pouvait valablement admettre avoir re\u00e7u l\u2019avis, une telle d\u00e9claration n\u2019est pas suffisante en mati\u00e8re criminelle. On ne peut pas pr\u00e9sumer que la pi\u00e8ce perdue d\u00e9montrait que le d\u00e9lai de sept jours avait \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9. Les d\u00e9clarations sous serment ne l\u2019ont pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9.\nLe magistrat a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 sans preuve compl\u00e8te d\u2019un avis signifi\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux exigences de la loi, et ce d\u00e9faut a eu pour effet de le priver de sa juridiction. L\u2019article 683(1) d\u00e9fend de proc\u00e9der en l\u2019absence d\u2019avis. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une condition pr\u00e9alable de l\u2019exercice valable de la juridiction.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement majoritaire de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique[1], confirmant le refus par le juge en chef Wilson de la demande d\u2019un bref d\u2019habeas corpus avec certiorari auxiliaire pour faire rejeter une ordonnance de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive.

Le juge Norris, de la Cour d\u2019appel, dissident, aurait accueilli l\u2019appel.\nEn vertu du par. 3 de l\u2019art. 691 du Code criminel, paragraphe que le chapitre 53 des Statuts du Canada 1964-65, sanctionn\u00e9 le 3 avril 1965, a \u00e9tabli, l\u2019appelant peut de plein droit interjeter appel \u00e0 cette Cour d\u2019un arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel confirmant le refus d\u2019une demande de bref d\u2019habeas corpus.

Ult\u00e9rieurement, la Cour a ordonn\u00e9 une nouvelle audition. Celle-ci a eu lieu le 2 juin devant la Cour au complet et l\u2019affaire a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\nM\u00eame si cela n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas essentiel \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision que nous devons rendre, je vais relater bri\u00e8vement la marche des proc\u00e9dures qui se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9es jusqu\u2019ici dans cette affaire pour autant qu\u2019on puisse le faire d\u2019apr\u00e8s le dossier assez fragmentaire produit en premi\u00e8re instance, en appel et devant nous.\nLe 6 mars 1958, l\u2019appelant s\u2019est avou\u00e9 coupable devant le magistrat Hunter sur l\u2019accusation d\u2019avoir commis un acte de grossi\u00e8re ind\u00e9cence avec une autre personne du sexe masculin, ce en violation de l\u2019art. 149 du Code criminel.\nLe 22 avril 1958 le magistrat Hunter a statu\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait atteint de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle et il l\u2019a condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 deux ann\u00e9es d\u2019emprisonnement sur l\u2019accusation de grossi\u00e8re ind\u00e9cence et en plus \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive.\nLe 18 mai 1958 l\u2019appelant a sign\u00e9 un acte de renonciation dans lequel il d\u00e9clarait avoir choisi de ne pas interjeter appel contre sa condamnation ou la sentence.\nLe 8 f\u00e9vrier 1964, l\u2019appelant a donn\u00e9 avis d\u2019une demande \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel pour faire proroger le d\u00e9lai d\u2019appel.\nLe 7 mai 1965, cette demande fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel, compos\u00e9e du juge Bird, juge en chef de la Colombie-Britannique, et des juges Davey et MacLean. Sans que l\u2019avocat de la Couronne soit appel\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre la parole, la Cour, par jugement oral, refusa la prorogation du d\u00e9lai de m\u00eame que la permission de r\u00e9tracter la renonciation \u00e0 interjeter appel.\nLe juge en chef Bird termina ainsi l\u2019expos\u00e9 des motifs de sa d\u00e9cision:\n[TRADUCTION] \u2026Dans les circonstances tout en n\u2019\u00e9tant pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 donner un ordre, je demanderais au substitut de voir si l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e com- pl\u00e8tement au minist\u00e8re du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans l\u2019espoir que l\u2019on fera une investigation compl\u00e8te sur le bien-fond\u00e9 des all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de cet individu.\nComme le dit mon coll\u00e8gue, le juge Davey, notre objectif c\u2019est, avant tout, de nous assurer qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019injustice et quoique cette cour n\u2019ait pas le pouvoir apr\u00e8s tout ce temps de faire enqu\u00eate sur la situation que Saunders dit avoir exist\u00e9, nous avons le sentiment qu\u2019il y a peut-\u00eatre un fond de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 dans ce qu\u2019il affirme et de cette fa\u00e7on nous aimerions \u00eatre s\u00fbrs que l\u2019affaire fera l\u2019objet d\u2019une investigation compl\u00e8te par les responsables de l\u2019administration de la justice en cette province.\nDans l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de ses motifs le juge Davey, alors juge d\u2019appel, se d\u00e9clara d\u2019accord pour sugg\u00e9rer ainsi au substitut que l\u2019on devrait faire une investigation.\nEn septembre 1965, l\u2019appelant a donn\u00e9 avis d\u2019une demande de bref d\u2019habeas corpus avec certiorari auxiliaire.\nLes 12 et 19 novembre 1965, le juge Branca, si\u00e9geant alors en premi\u00e8re instance, entendit la demande et le 23 novembre 1965, il la rejeta.

La d\u00e9claration sous serment du requ\u00e9rant ne soul\u00e8ve ni d\u00e9montre aucun d\u00e9faut de juridiction.\nJe m\u2019empresse d\u2019ajouter que si le pouvoir de surveillance accord\u00e9 \u00e0 cette Cour lui permettait d\u2019examiner la preuve en cette affaire, la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 ou constatation de fait en tant qu\u2019elle d\u00e9clare le requ\u00e9rant atteint de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle serait cass\u00e9e imm\u00e9diatement pour les motifs indiqu\u00e9s.\nC\u2019est d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment que j\u2019ai compl\u00e8tement pass\u00e9 en revue la preuve et les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents dans l\u2019espoir et l\u2019attente que les avocats signaleront la chose \u00e0 ceux qui peuvent avoir le droit de corriger l\u2019injustice commise en cette cause, ce que cette Cour pour les motifs indiqu\u00e9s n\u2019a malheureusement pas dans les circonstances le pouvoir de faire.\nL\u2019appelant a interjet\u00e9 appel de la d\u00e9cision du juge Branca. L\u2019appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu les 24 et 25 mars 1966 et l\u2019arr\u00eat prononc\u00e9 \u00e0 la cl\u00f4ture de l\u2019audition. Le juge Davey, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque juge d\u2019appel, fonda sa d\u00e9cision sur le seul article 682(b) du Code criminel, en disant que l\u2019appelant aurait pu en appeler de la sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive et ne l\u2019avait pas fait. Le juge d\u2019appel Lord fut du m\u00eame avis. Le juge d\u2019appel Bull exprima son accord dans les termes suivants:\n[TRADUCTION] Je suis d\u2019accord qu\u2019il faut rejeter l\u2019appel, mais je le fais avec quelque r\u00e9pugnance. Je dis avec r\u00e9pugnance parce qu\u2019il me para\u00eet y avoir eu plusieurs erreurs \u00e0 l\u2019audition qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la condamnation. Malgr\u00e9 cela je consid\u00e8re que le magistrat avait plein pouvoir de faire la d\u00e9claration et prononcer la sentence. Comme le dit mon savant coll\u00e8gue, il faut rejeter l\u2019appel.\nIl convient de signaler ici que ni le juge Branca, ni la Cour d\u2019appel n\u2019ont fait mention du principal moyen dont on a fait \u00e9tat devant cette Cour, savoir qu\u2019il n\u2019appert pas que l\u2019avis prescrit par l\u2019alin\u00e9a (b) du par. 1 de l\u2019art. 662 du Code criminel comme il se lisait lors de l\u2019audition devant le magistrat Hunter, ait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant sept jours francs avant l\u2019audition. Il est \u00e0 noter que le juge Branca, dans le passage pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 de ses motifs, dit que la d\u00e9claration sous serment de l\u2019appelant ne soul\u00e8ve aucun d\u00e9faut de juridiction.\nDans cette d\u00e9claration de l\u2019appelant il n\u2019est fait mention de l\u2019avis qu\u2019aux paragraphes 20 et 22 qui se lisent comme suit:\n[TRADUCTION] 20. Le substitut n\u2019a pas produit \u00e0 l\u2019audition une preuve de signification de l\u2019avis de la demande.\n* * *\n22. Le substitut n\u2019a pas produit une copie de cet avis de la demande au greffier du tribunal ou au magistrat.\nOn voit qu\u2019il n\u2019y est pas question de la suffisance du d\u00e9lai donn\u00e9 par l\u2019avis. En lisant en entier les motifs du juge Branca, on voit clairement qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas parl\u00e9 de la question de savoir si l\u2019appelant avait re\u00e7u assez longtemps \u00e0 l\u2019avance un avis de pr\u00e9sentation de la demande.\nLe 31 mars 1966, l\u2019appelant a produit un avis de requ\u00eate pour permission d\u2019appeler et pour prorogation du d\u00e9lai afin d\u2019interjeter appel de la d\u00e9cision du magistrat Hunter. Cette demande fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 27 mai 1966 au juge en chef de la C.-B., le juge Bird, si\u00e9geant avec les juges d\u2019appel Tysoe et McFarlane, et elle fut rejet\u00e9e le 7 juin 1966. Les motifs de la Cour d\u2019appel, expos\u00e9s par le juge en chef Bird, rel\u00e8vent trois moyens invoqu\u00e9s par l\u2019appelant et pr\u00e9cisent que celui-ci n\u2019en a invoqu\u00e9 aucun autre. Aucun de ces trois moyens ne soul\u00e8ve la question de savoir si l\u2019appelant a re\u00e7u un avis de sept jours francs de la pr\u00e9sentation de la demande au magistrat Hunter.\nLe 18 mai 1967, l\u2019appelant a donn\u00e9 avis de la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une demande de bref d\u2019habeas corpus avec certiorari auxiliaire. Cette demande fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au juge en chef Wilson et rejet\u00e9e le 7 ao\u00fbt 1967 ainsi qu\u2019il est relat\u00e9 au premier alin\u00e9a du pr\u00e9sent expos\u00e9 de motifs.\nLes pi\u00e8ces qui nous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produites ne contiennent pas de motifs par \u00e9crit du juge en chef Wilson. Ce savant juge a, toutefois, le 16 ao\u00fbt 1967, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019art. 588(1) du Code criminel un rapport ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9:\n[TRADUCTION] Mon rapport en cette affaire sera bref. La m\u00eame condamnation a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e par M. le juge Branca sur une pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente requ\u00eate pour habeas corpus avec certiorari auxiliaire et il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le 23 novembre 1965 ses motifs \u00e9crits de rejet. Je ne puis faire mieux. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9 je puis dire que le mandat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t n\u2019\u00e9tant pas contest\u00e9, je ne pouvais voir de motif valable d\u2019accorder l\u2019habeas corpus. Quant au certiorari il m\u2019a paru exclu par l\u2019article 682 du Code criminel et j\u2019ai aussi consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que la demande devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e pour les motifs donn\u00e9s par le juge Branca, si\u00e9geant alors en premi\u00e8re instance.\nA l\u2019appui de sa demande devant le juge en chef Wilson, l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un affidavit de quatre-vingt-seize alin\u00e9as dont le vingti\u00e8me est ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9:\n[TRADUCTION] 20. Je n\u2019ai pas eu un avis de sept jours francs avant le proc\u00e8s ainsi que la loi le requiert avant que la Cour ait juridiction de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019audition pour d\u00e9cider si l\u2019accus\u00e9 est atteint de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle.\nOn remarquera que le juge en chef Wilson ne traite pas la question de savoir si le magistrat Hunter \u00e9tait d\u00e9pourvu de juridiction du fait du pr\u00e9tendu d\u00e9faut d\u2019avoir donn\u00e9 un avis de sept jours francs de la demande visant \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait atteint de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle.\nUne Cour de cinq juges entendit l\u2019appel de la d\u00e9cision du juge en chef Wilson. Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, le juge Norris, dissident, aurait accueilli l\u2019appel. Le juge d\u2019appel Tysoe r\u00e9digea l\u2019opinion majoritaire \u00e0 laquelle les juges d\u2019appel Bull, McFarlane et Robertson ont souscrit.\nAvant d\u2019examiner les motifs de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel il convient de citer le texte de l\u2019art. 691 du Code criminel comme il se lit pr\u00e9sentement tout comme \u00e0 la date de la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au juge en chef Wilson.\n691. (1) Appel peut \u00eatre interjet\u00e9 \u00e0 la cour d\u2019appel contre une d\u00e9cision qui accorde ou refuse le secours demand\u00e9 dans des proc\u00e9dures par voie de mandamus, de certiorari ou de prohibition.\n(2) Sauf ce qui est pr\u00e9vu ci-apr\u00e8s au pr\u00e9sent article, les dispositions de la Partie XVIII s\u2019appliquent, mutatis mutandis, aux appels interjet\u00e9s sous le r\u00e9gime du pr\u00e9sent article.\n(3) Lorsqu\u2019une demande de bref d\u2019habeas corpus ad subjiciendum est refus\u00e9e par un juge d\u2019une cour ayant juridiction en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, aucune demande ne peut \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e de nouveau pour les m\u00eames motifs, soit \u00e0 la m\u00eame cour ou au m\u00eame juge, soit \u00e0 quelque autre cour ou juge, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019une preuve nouvelle ne soit fournie, mais il y a appel de ce refus \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel et si, lors de cet appel, la demande est refus\u00e9e un nouvel appel peut \u00eatre interjet\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada.\n(4) Lorsqu\u2019un bref d\u2019habeas corpus ad subjiciendum est \u00e9mis par un juge, aucun appel de cette d\u00e9cision ne peut \u00eatre interjet\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019instance d\u2019une partie quelconque, y compris le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la province en cause ou le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada.\n(5) Lorsqu\u2019un jugement est d\u00e9livr\u00e9 au moment du rapport d\u2019un bref d\u2019habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, il peut en \u00eatre interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel et il y a appel d\u2019un jugement de cette derni\u00e8re Cour \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, si cette Cour l\u2019autorise, \u00e0 l\u2019instance du demandeur ou du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la province en cause ou du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, mais non \u00e0 l\u2019instance de quelque autre partie.\n(6) Un appel en mati\u00e8re d\u2019habeas corpus doit \u00eatre entendu par la cour \u00e0 laquelle il est adress\u00e9 \u00e0 une date rapproch\u00e9e, que ce soit pendant les sessions prescrites de la cour ou en dehors de cette p\u00e9riode.\nTous les membres de la Cour d\u2019appel furent d\u2019avis qu\u2019une \u00abpreuve nouvelle\u00bb avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie devant le juge en chef Wilson, parce que la premi\u00e8re transcription des proc\u00e9dures devant le magistrat Hunter, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie \u00e0 l\u2019appelant par le st\u00e9nographe de la Cour et produite devant le juge Branca, \u00e9tait manifestement incompl\u00e8te tandis que la seconde transcription, beaucoup plus compl\u00e8te, n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 la dis- position de l\u2019appelant qu\u2019apr\u00e8s que le juge Branca eut prononc\u00e9 son jugement. Il est clair que cette conclusion \u00e9tait juste et que, par cons\u00e9quent, les dispositions du par. 3 de l\u2019art. 691 n\u2019emp\u00eachaient pas la pr\u00e9sentation de la demande au juge en chef Wilson.\nDans l\u2019expos\u00e9 de ses motifs, le juge d\u2019appel Tysoe, apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9sum\u00e9 les proc\u00e9dures ant\u00e9rieures, relata l\u2019all\u00e9gation de l\u2019appelant, savoir que la preuve faite devant le juge en chef Wilson d\u00e9montrait que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u un avis de sept jours francs de la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au magistrat Hunter en vue de faire d\u00e9clarer l\u2019appelant atteint de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle, que, par cons\u00e9quent, le magistrat n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019audition, que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait ill\u00e9galement d\u00e9tenu et qu\u2019il avait droit ex debito justitiae au recours de l\u2019habeas corpus. Il examina ensuite les all\u00e9gations du substitut du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, savoir (i) que le mandat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t est en apparence valide, (ii) que dans de telles proc\u00e9dures la Cour ne peut aller en dehors du mandat et (iii) que lorsque le magistrat proc\u00e8de en vertu de l\u2019article 661 du Code criminel il ne si\u00e8ge pas dans une cour inf\u00e9rieure mais dans une cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nLe juge d\u2019appel Tysoe n\u2019a pas admis ces all\u00e9gations de la Couronne mais il ne semble pas avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en fin de compte qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient insoutenables. Il dit notamment:\n[TRADUCTION] Si la contestation de la juridiction du magistrat r\u00e9ussit, le mandat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t tombe \u00e9galement car, en ce cas, il se trouve avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9 par une personne qui n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de le faire et il est par cons\u00e9quent invalide.\nJe ne suis pas convaincu que la pr\u00e9tention du poursuivant que la cour ne peut aller en dehors du mandat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t soit bien fond\u00e9e. Pour cette raison, je vais rendre ma d\u00e9cision en prenant pour acquis que la Cour du magistrat est un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur et que la cour de premi\u00e8re instance tout comme cette cour a le droit d\u2019aller en dehors du mandat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t pour rechercher si le magistrat qui l\u2019a d\u00e9livr\u00e9 avait juridiction pour tenir l\u2019audition en vertu de l\u2019article 661 et faire la d\u00e9claration sur laquelle le mandat repose.\nIl est clair que le magistrat Hunter constituait une cour inf\u00e9rieure et non une cour sup\u00e9rieure. Cela ressort du Magistrates Act en vigueur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de l\u2019audition, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 195, modifi\u00e9 par le chapitre 45 des lois de 1955 (C.\u2011B.), aujourd\u2019hui chapitre 36 des lois de Colombie-Britannique 1962, en particulier les articles 3, 4 et 5. Cela ressort \u00e9galement des art. 2(13)(b), 2(14)(d) et 659(a) du Code criminel.\nImm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s le dernier passage cit\u00e9, le juge d\u2019appel Tysoe poursuit:\n[TRADUCTION] Le substitut du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a conc\u00e9d\u00e9, \u00e0 bon droit, que, malgr\u00e9 l\u2019article 682 du Code qui se lit comme suit:\n682. Aucune condamnation ou ordonnance ne doit \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e par certiorari\n(a) lorsqu\u2019un appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 interjet\u00e9, que l\u2019appel ait \u00e9t\u00e9 ou non poursuivi jusqu\u2019\u00e0 sa conclusion; ou\n(b) lorsque le d\u00e9fendeur a comparu et plaid\u00e9, que l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e au fond, et qu\u2019un appel aurait pu \u00eatre interjet\u00e9, mais que le d\u00e9fendeur ne l\u2019a pas interjet\u00e9,\nil y a lieu \u00e0 certiorari si le savant magistrat a agi en cette affaire sans juridiction, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire qu\u2019ab initio il n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de statuer sur la demande du minist\u00e8re public si l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9ellement eu sept jours francs d\u2019avis.\nDe prime abord, cette concession surprend du fait que la Cour qui a statu\u00e9 sur l\u2019appel du jugement du juge Branca a fond\u00e9 son arr\u00eat sur les seules dispositions de l\u2019art. 682 et que le juge en chef Wilson a aussi fond\u00e9 son jugement en partie sur cet article. Mais il faut se rappeler que la seule fois o\u00f9 l\u2019appelant fut repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat avant l\u2019audition en Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019appel du jugement du juge en chef Wilson ce fut lors de la pr\u00e9sentation de la demande devant le juge Branca. Or, nous l\u2019avons signal\u00e9, rien dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 minutieux des motifs de jugement de ce juge ne donne \u00e0 penser que la question fut soulev\u00e9e devant lui. C\u2019est au cours de l\u2019audition de l\u2019appel du jugement du juge en chef Wilson que pour la premi\u00e8re fois il fut soutenu que par suite du pr\u00e9tendu d\u00e9faut d\u2019avis de sept jours francs le magistrat n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019audition.\nS\u2019il est vrai que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u un avis de sept jours francs ainsi que l\u2019exige l\u2019art. 662(1)(b) du Code criminel, le magistrat \u00e9tait alors incomp\u00e9tent ab initio et, comme l\u2019ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 tous les juges de la Cour d\u2019appel, le mandat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t doit \u00eatre tenu pour invalide.\nLes deux questions qui se posent sont les suivantes: (i) la Cour peut-elle en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce rechercher si l\u2019avis requis a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 et (ii) dans l\u2019affirmative, doit-elle d\u00e9cider qu\u2019il l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9. C\u2019est sur la deuxi\u00e8me question que le juge d\u2019appel Norris ne fut pas de l\u2019avis de la majorit\u00e9.\nSur la premi\u00e8re question, le juge Tysoe a dit que le substitut avait raison de conc\u00e9der que l\u2019art. 682 du Code criminel n\u2019enl\u00e8ve pas le droit au certiorari, et il a examin\u00e9 certaines d\u00e9cisions \u00e0 l\u2019appui. Devant notre Cour cependant, l\u2019avocat du minist\u00e8re public soutient que le par. (b) de l\u2019art. 682 prive effectivement les tribunaux du pouvoir d\u2019accorder le certiorari en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. A mon avis, cette pr\u00e9tention doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Je n\u2019ai pas l\u2019intention de citer dans le d\u00e9tail les nombreuses d\u00e9cisions o\u00f9 les tribunaux ont \u00e9tudi\u00e9 l\u2019art. 682. Ces d\u00e9cisions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 collig\u00e9es dans Martin\u2019s Annual Criminal Code, 1968, aux pages 635 \u00e0 642. La pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance est fortement \u00e0 l\u2019appui de l\u2019avis si clairement exprim\u00e9 par le juge Hall, alors juge en chef de la Cour du Banc de la reine, dans Regina v. Phillips[2] et par le juge Spence dans Regina v. Heins[3]: l\u2019article 682 ne fait pas obstacle au certiorari lorsque les proc\u00e9dures qu\u2019on veut contester sont nulles ab initio.\nAdmettre le raisonnement de l\u2019avocat du minist\u00e8re public sur cette question signifierait que l\u2019affaire Smith v. The Queen[4] a \u00e9t\u00e9 mal jug\u00e9e. Dans cette cause-l\u00e0, le juge Campbell avait rejet\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pour certiorari aux fins d\u2019annuler une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9clarant \u00abjeune d\u00e9linquant\u00bb un gar\u00e7on de 14 ans. Par un arr\u00eat majoritaire, la Cour d\u2019appel du Manitoba avait confirm\u00e9 le rejet. Dans cette Cour, ces d\u00e9cisions furent infirm\u00e9es et la d\u00e9claration fut annul\u00e9e. Il est vrai que l\u2019on n\u2019y a pas fait mention de l\u2019art. 682 dans les motifs mais dans sa dissidence, en Cour d\u2019appel du Manitoba, le juge en chef Adamson en avait parl\u00e9. Cet arr\u00eat est consign\u00e9 sous le titre Regina v. Gerald X (or G.S.)[5]. A la page 106 on trouve ce passage des motifs du juge en chef:\n[TRADUCTION] Le certiorari est le recours appropri\u00e9 au cas d\u2019incomp\u00e9tence d\u2019un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur. Le certiorari est le recours voulu pour soulever l\u2019insuffisance de l\u2019assignation: 13 Can. Abr. 1706; Re Ruggles (1902) 5 Can. C.C. 163, 35 N.S.R. 57; Code crim. art. 682, 683 et 691; Paulowich v. Dankochuk, 73 Can. C.C. 273, (1940) 2 D.L.R. 106, 48 Man. R. 6.\nLe juge Coyne, qui a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 les motifs de la majorit\u00e9, s\u2019exprime ainsi, comme on le voit \u00e0 la page 127:\n[TRADUCTION] L\u2019appelant a droit d\u2019appel en vertu de l\u2019article 37 mais il n\u2019a pas choisi de l\u2019exercer. En appel il aurait pu soulever toutes les questions qui se pr\u00e9sentent en cette instance. La d\u00e9claration a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par le juge de la Cour des jeunes d\u00e9linquants et l\u2019amende impos\u00e9e le 23 septembre. Le d\u00e9lai pour demander la permission d\u2019interjeter appel se terminait le 3 octobre et ne pouvait \u00eatre prorog\u00e9 par permission sp\u00e9ciale apr\u00e8s le 23 du m\u00eame mois. Les pr\u00e9sentes proc\u00e9dures ne furent institu\u00e9es que le 23 novembre.\nJe ne crois pas qu\u2019on doive supposer que cette Cour n\u2019ait pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les dispositions de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (b) de l\u2019article 682.\nA mon avis l\u2019art. 682 n\u2019exclut pas en la pr\u00e9sente cause le pouvoir d\u2019accorder le certiorari auxiliaire du bref d\u2019habeas corpus et les tribunaux de premi\u00e8re instance et d\u2019appel avaient le droit d\u2019examiner le dossier afin de d\u00e9terminer si le magistrat \u00e9tait sans comp\u00e9tence ab initio.\nJ\u2019en suis venu \u00e0 cette conclusion parce qu\u2019elle me semble s\u2019accorder avec l\u2019opinion juridique pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante. Mon avis serait le m\u00eame, toutefois, si la question \u00e9tait res integra. Il est clair que l\u2019alin\u00e9a (a) de l\u2019art. 682 ne s\u2019applique pas aux circonstances de l\u2019affaire en instance; il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019appel.\nLes dispositions de l\u2019art. 682 qui nous int\u00e9ressent sont les suivantes:\n682. Aucune condamnation ou ordonnance ne doit \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e par certiorari\n* * * (b) lorsque le d\u00e9fendeur a comparu et plaid\u00e9, que l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e au fond, et qu\u2019un appel aurait pu \u00eatre interjet\u00e9, mais que le d\u00e9fendeur ne l\u2019a pas interjet\u00e9.\nAppliquons ce texte aux faits du litige. La d\u00e9cision du magistrat d\u00e9clarant que l\u2019appelant est atteint de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle (d\u00e9cision qui entra\u00eene obligatoirement une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive) n\u2019est pas une \u00abcondamnation\u00bb mais il se peut qu\u2019on puisse \u00e0 juste titre la consid\u00e9rer comme une \u00abordonnance\u00bb au sens de l\u2019article. Il est clair que l\u2019appelant a comparu devant le magistrat et qu\u2019un appel de la d\u00e9cision du magistrat aurait pu \u00eatre interjet\u00e9 mais il est \u00e9galement clair qu\u2019aucun plaidoyer n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9; les dispositions de l\u2019art. 661 du Code criminel ne pr\u00e9voient pas que la personne au sujet de laquelle on doit faire enqu\u00eate pour d\u00e9terminer si elle est atteinte de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle soit appel\u00e9e \u00e0 formuler un plaidoyer. Il s\u2019ensuit que cette cause n\u2019est pas vis\u00e9e par la teneur litt\u00e9rale de l\u2019art. 682.\nIl y a plus. Comment peut-on dire que \u00abl\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e au fond\u00bb si en fait et en droit le magistrat qui pr\u00e9tendait pr\u00e9sider le \u00abproc\u00e8s\u00bb n\u2019avait pas acquis la comp\u00e9tence n\u00e9cessaire pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019audition de la demande? A d\u00e9faut de l\u2019avis requis les d\u00e9bats devant le magistrat ne constituaient pas un proc\u00e8s mais une nullit\u00e9. Sur ce point, il n\u2019y eut aucune divergence d\u2019opinions en Cour d\u2019appel. Il est clair que le juge Tysoe, qui a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 les motifs de la majorit\u00e9, aurait accueilli l\u2019appel s\u2019il n\u2019avait pas conclu que l\u2019avis requis avait effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9.\nL\u2019alin\u00e9a (b) du par. (1) de l\u2019art. 662 du Code criminel, comme il se lisait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de l\u2019audition devant le magistrat Hunter, est explicite. En voici le texte:\n(b) Une demande selon le paragraphe (1) de l\u2019article 661 ne peut pas \u00eatre entendue, \u00e0 moins que le poursuivant n\u2019en ait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 un avis de sept jours francs et que copie de l\u2019avis n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au bureau du greffier de la cour ou du magistrat, lorsque ce dernier agit sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la Partie XVI.\nLa signification de l\u2019avis de m\u00eame que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une copie sont clairement des conditions pr\u00e9alables du droit pour le magistrat d\u2019entendre la demande. Le bref de certiorari est un tr\u00e8s ancien bref de pr\u00e9rogative. Son objet est de permettre \u00e0 la cour qui correspond \u00e0 la Court of Queen\u2019s Bench en Angleterre (en l\u2019occurrence la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie-Britannique) de contr\u00f4ler les d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs et de veiller \u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils n\u2019outrepassent pas leur juridiction. Il est clair que dans l\u2019affaire dont nous sommes saisis c\u2019est un recours appropri\u00e9 accessible \u00e0 l\u2019appelant \u00e0 moins que l\u2019art. 682 ne lui en enl\u00e8ve le droit. Le pouvoir du Parlement de supprimer ce recours est indiscutable. Toutefois, je suis d\u2019avis que pour en arriver l\u00e0 il faut que cela se fasse en termes clairs et explicites. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit pourquoi je suis d\u2019avis que les circonstances de l\u2019instance ne sont pas vis\u00e9es par l\u2019art. 682 m\u00eame si \u00e0 l\u2019encontre, je le crois, de l\u2019opinion pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante, on devait d\u00e9cider que cet article peut enlever le droit au certiorari dans les cas o\u00f9 l\u2019on all\u00e8gue que le tribunal inf\u00e9rieur a agi sans comp\u00e9tence ab initio.\nEn recherchant l\u2019intention du Parlement on peut consid\u00e9rer les r\u00e9sultats qui d\u00e9coulent de deux interpr\u00e9tations possibles des termes d\u2019une loi. S\u2019il est av\u00e9r\u00e9 (question qui reste \u00e0 d\u00e9cider) que l\u2019avis prescrit par l\u2019alin\u00e9a (b) du par. (1) de l\u2019art. 662 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant et si l\u2019on d\u00e9cide que l\u2019art. 682 a enlev\u00e9 le droit au certiorari il en r\u00e9sulte que l\u2019appelant qui n\u2019avait pas d\u2019avocat, qui a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son droit d\u2019appel, qui a laiss\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9couler le d\u00e9lai pour interjeter appel demeure sans recours bien qu\u2019il soit sous le coup d\u2019une sentence d\u2019emprisonnement pour le reste de ses jours, une sentence qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e par un magistrat qui n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour statuer que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait atteint de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle ni pour imposer une sentence en cons\u00e9quence. Je ne puis penser que le Parlement ait voulu un tel r\u00e9sultat. Quand je dis que l\u2019appelant reste sans recours, je n\u2019oublie pas que la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique avait, et a encore, je le suppose, le pouvoir de proroger le d\u00e9lai d\u2019appel. Mais l\u2019appelant ne peut r\u00e9clamer une telle prorogation comme un droit; il ne peut la demander que par faveur. Deux fois il l\u2019a sollicit\u00e9e mais sans succ\u00e8s. La deuxi\u00e8me fois, la Cour d\u2019appel \u00e9tait indubitablement au courant de ce qu\u2019avait dit le juge Branca dans les motifs que j\u2019ai cit\u00e9s. Par contre, s\u2019il appert que le magistrat a agi sans comp\u00e9tence le bref de certiorari doit \u00eatre d\u00e9livr\u00e9 ex debito justitiae. A mon avis, si le Parlement avait voulu que le droit au certiorari soit enlev\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur a outrepass\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence il aurait ajout\u00e9 au d\u00e9but de l\u2019art. 682 quelque chose comme par exemple \u00abm\u00eame dans le cas d\u2019un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur qui a agi sans aucune comp\u00e9tence\u00bb. Il est inutile d\u2019\u00e9piloguer sur l\u2019invraisemblance d\u2019une telle intention du Parlement.\nPour toutes ces raisons, je suis convaincu que dans la cause dont nous sommes saisis le droit au certiorari n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9.\nParvenu \u00e0 cette conclusion, il ne semble pas vraiment n\u00e9cessaire que j\u2019\u00e9tudie l\u2019autre argument invoqu\u00e9 par M. Kennedy, savoir que le mandat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t produit \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie-Britannique et dont le texte a \u00e9t\u00e9 consign\u00e9 en entier ci-dessus est d\u00e9fectueux parce qu\u2019il indique que l\u2019ordonnance en vertu de laquelle l\u2019appelant est d\u00e9tenu a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue par un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur mais ne fait pas voir que l\u2019avis imp\u00e9rieusement prescrit par l\u2019alin\u00e9a (b) du par. (1) de l\u2019art. 662 du Code criminel comme condition pr\u00e9alable du droit pour le magistrat d\u2019entendre la demande ait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant ni qu\u2019on en ait produit une copie comme cela est exig\u00e9. Toutefois, comme d\u2019autres membres de cette Cour ont examin\u00e9 et rejet\u00e9 cet argument, il me para\u00eet \u00e0 propos de dire ce que j\u2019en pense.\nSur ce point, il convient de rappeler, tout d\u2019abord que l\u2019objet de la demande de l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas un simple certiorari mais bien un bref d\u2019habeas corpus avec certiorari auxiliaire. Le paragraphe (3) de l\u2019art. 691 du Code donne express\u00e9ment droit d\u2019appel \u00e0 cette Cour du rejet par la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019une demande de bref d\u2019habeas corpus ad subjiciendum. D\u2019autre part, l\u2019art. 61 de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame lui accorde le pouvoir de d\u00e9livrer un bref de certiorari \u00aben vue de faire produire toutes les pi\u00e8ces d\u00e9pos\u00e9es ou les proc\u00e9dures prises devant toute cour, tout juge ou juge de paix, et qui sont jug\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires pour une enqu\u00eate, un appel ou autre proc\u00e9dure port\u00e9e devant la Cour\u00bb. Comme on l\u2019a vu, M. Kennedy a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de bref de certiorari conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cet article 61. Le paragraphe (3) de l\u2019art. 691 du Code et l\u2019art. 61 de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame doivent se lire l\u2019un en regard de l\u2019autre. S\u2019il y a divergence entre leurs dispositions et l\u2019art. 682 du Code, elles doivent l\u2019emporter; generalia specialibus non derogant.\nJ\u2019en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le mandat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t est d\u00e9fectueux pour le motif invoqu\u00e9 par M. Kennedy et ci-dessus expos\u00e9. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 signal\u00e9 que le magistrat Hunter constituait un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur. Une r\u00e8gle depuis longtemps \u00e9tablie est ainsi \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 10e \u00e9dition, \u00e0 la page 101:\n[TRADUCTION] En dernier lieu, on a dit qu\u2019il y a une distinction \u00e0 faire entre les ordonnaces d\u2019une cour sup\u00e9rieure et celles d\u2019un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur; dans le premier cas la r\u00e8gle est: \u00abOmnia rite acta esse praesumuntur\u00bb, dans le second, c\u2019est: \u00abDe non apparentibus et non existentibus eadem est ratio\u00bb. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le texte d\u2019une ordonnance d\u00e9montre l\u2019existence de la juridiction d\u2019une cour sup\u00e9rieure mais, s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur c\u2019est indispensable.\nPuis \u00e0 la page 646:\n[TRADUCTION] Il faut cependant, outre cette observation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, noter soigneusement que, dans les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs et les proc\u00e9dures devant un magistrat, la maxime \u00abomnia praesumuntur rite esse acta\u00bb n\u2019est pas applicable aux fins d\u2019attribuer une juridiction.\nLes mots soulign\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en italiques par l\u2019auteur. Un arr\u00eat de la Chambre des lords, conforme \u00e0 l\u2019opinion unanime des juges, et consign\u00e9 sous le titre Mayor and Aldermen of the City of London v. Richard Henry Cox et al[6], appuie enti\u00e8rement cet \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de la r\u00e8gle, comme on peut le voir notamment aux pages 262 et 263.\nDire que le mandat doit indiquer que l\u2019avis prescrit a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 et qu\u2019une copie en a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite n\u2019implique pas que l\u2019on va lib\u00e9rer un d\u00e9tenu lorsque l\u2019avis a effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 et produit. En ce cas on pourra produire un mandat corrig\u00e9 et appliquer les dispositions de l\u2019art. 683 du Code.\nLorsqu\u2019il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9, comme dans cette cause, qu\u2019une condition pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019acquisition par le tribunal inf\u00e9rieur de la comp\u00e9tence n\u00e9cessaire pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019audition n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie et que le mandat est muet sur ce point, l\u2019art. 61 de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame offre un moyen rapide de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019all\u00e9gation est bien fond\u00e9e.\nLa r\u00e8gle \u00e0 suivre est formul\u00e9e avec pr\u00e9cision dans Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, supra, \u00e0 la page 647, comme suit:\n[TRADUCTION] Bien qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019indiquer la comp\u00e9tence du tribunal inf\u00e9rieur, il n\u2019y a pas de formule sp\u00e9ciale pour la d\u00e9montrer. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure investie du droit de contr\u00f4ler le tribunal inf\u00e9rieur doit pouvoir v\u00e9rifier d\u2019une fa\u00e7on ou d\u2019une autre l\u2019existence de la comp\u00e9tence requise pour la validit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure, peu importe de quelle fa\u00e7on pourvu qu\u2019elle puisse la constater. On peut donc dire que la r\u00e8gle c\u2019est que s\u2019il appert du texte des proc\u00e9dures que le tribunal inf\u00e9rieur \u00e9tait comp\u00e9tent on les tiendra pour r\u00e9guli\u00e8res, mais cela n\u2019aura pas lieu autrement, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire s\u2019il appert que le tribunal inf\u00e9rieur n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence ou s\u2019il y a doute \u00e0 ce sujet. La vieille r\u00e8gle sur la comp\u00e9tence c\u2019est que rien n\u2019est en dehors de la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019une cour sup\u00e9rieure que ce qui en est express\u00e9ment exclu et rien n\u2019est de la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur que ce qui lui est express\u00e9rent attribu\u00e9. Encore une fois, dans toutes proc\u00e9dures devant un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur, il est n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019affaire est de sa comp\u00e9tence.\nM\u00eame si cela ne me para\u00eet pas strictement n\u00e9cessaire, parce que j\u2019estime que nous sommes d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement saisis des proc\u00e9dures du tribunal inf\u00e9rieur, je suis d\u2019avis de d\u00e9livrer un bref de certorari en vertu de l\u2019art. 61 de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame pour qu\u2019elles soient produites devant cette Cour.\nLa cons\u00e9quence de tout ce que j\u2019ai dit jusqu\u2019ici c\u2019est qu\u2019\u00e0 mon avis les cours de premi\u00e8re instance et d\u2019appel avaient le droit et le devoir d\u2019examiner le dossier des proc\u00e9dures devant le magistrat de m\u00eame que les d\u00e9clarations sous serment produites devant le juge en chef Wilson aux fins de v\u00e9rifier si l\u2019avis prescrit par l\u2019alin\u00e9a (b) du par. (1) de l\u2019art. 662 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment donn\u00e9 et produit, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire aux fins de juger si le magistrat avait comp\u00e9tence pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Cela signifie que cette Cour a le m\u00eame droit et le m\u00eame devoir. L\u2019autre question est celle de savoir si la conclusion de la majorit\u00e9 en Cour d\u2019appel, \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019avis requis a effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant sept jours francs avant l\u2019audition peut \u00eatre retenue. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 toutes les pi\u00e8ces au dossier, je suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019elle ne peut l\u2019\u00eatre.\nEn toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne puis souscrire \u00e0 l\u2019opinion du juge Tysoe, exprim\u00e9e en ces termes:\n[TRADUCTION] A mon avis, dans les circonstances, l\u2019appelant a le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u l\u2019avis de sept jours francs prescrit par l\u2019alin\u00e9a (b) du paragraphe (1) de l\u2019article 662 du Code. Ce fardeau est lourd. Il est \u00e9vident que lorsque l\u2019appelant a, comme le fait voir l\u2019extrait ci-dessus du proc\u00e8s-verbal, formellement admis avoir re\u00e7u signification de l\u2019avis, il a d\u00fb avoir l\u2019intention de faire croire au magistrat qu\u2019il ne contestait pas la suffisance de l\u2019avis d\u2019audition de la demande qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9. Cela, il me semble, ajoute au fardeau qui incombe \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de d\u00e9montrer p\u00e9remptoirement, s\u2019il le peut, qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ellement re\u00e7u l\u2019avis prescrit par le Code.\nLa marche des proc\u00e9dures semble d\u00e9montrer que ce ne fut qu\u2019au moment de l\u2019audition devant la Cour d\u2019appel que l\u2019appelant se rendit compte qu\u2019il avait droit \u00e0 un avis de sept jours francs. Il ne met pas en question la r\u00e9ception d\u2019un avis. Tout ce qu\u2019il veut faire valoir c\u2019est qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u l\u2019avis de sept jours francs avant l\u2019audition. Il n\u2019y a pas de pr\u00e9somption qu\u2019il \u00e9tait au fait lorsqu\u2019il a reconnu devant le magistrat avoir re\u00e7u l\u2019avis. Je souscris \u00e0 ce qu\u2019a dit Lord Atkin dans Evans v. Bartlam[7] et qui est consign\u00e9 \u00e0 la page 479:\n[TRADUCTION] Je ne suis pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 admettre qu\u2019il y a en droit une pr\u00e9somption que les r\u00e8gles et ordonnances de la cour sup\u00e9rieure sont connues de tous, pas m\u00eame des juges. De fait, il n\u2019y a pas et il n\u2019y a jamais eu une pr\u00e9somption que la loi est connue de tous. Il y a bien le principe que l\u2019ignorance de la loi n\u2019est pas une excuse, mais c\u2019est une maxime d\u2019une port\u00e9e et d\u2019un effet bien diff\u00e9rents.\nSi devant le magistrat Hunter on avait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement fait la proc\u00e9dure et conserv\u00e9 les pi\u00e8ces, le dossier remis \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame de la Colombie-Britannique aurait renferm\u00e9 une copie de l\u2019avis donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant et une preuve, par proc\u00e8s-verbal ou d\u00e9position sous serment, de la date de la signification. On n\u2019y trouve rien de tel. Comment peut-on dire que l\u2019appelant a le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer ce qui devrait \u00eatre au dossier?\nComme l\u2019a signal\u00e9 le juge Norris, la longue d\u00e9claration de l\u2019appelant consiste en grande partie en une argumentation. Mais la conclusion qu\u2019il cherche \u00e0 tirer semble in\u00e9luctable: si la d\u00e9claration du constable qui a signifi\u00e9 l\u2019avis \u00e0 l\u2019appelant est exacte et la signification a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite au Palais de justice \u00e0 Cloverdale, l\u2019avis n\u2019a pas pu \u00eatre signifi\u00e9 sept jours francs avant l\u2019audition.\nSur cet aspect de la question je souscris en substance aux raisons du juge d\u2019appel Norris et je ne r\u00e9p\u00e9terai pas ce qu\u2019il a dit.\nAvant de terminer, je veux faire une derni\u00e8re observation. Il est indiscutable que les proc\u00e9dures pr\u00e9vues par les art. 660 et 661 du Code criminel, qui mettent en jeu la libert\u00e9 de l\u2019accus\u00e9 pour le reste de ses jours, sont strictissimi juris. Au cours d\u2019un proc\u00e8s pour acte criminel l\u2019art. 562 du Code, tout comme au cours d\u2019un proc\u00e8s pour infraction punissable sur d\u00e9claration sommaire de culpabilit\u00e9 le par. 5 de l\u2019art. 708, permet \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 ou son avocat d\u2019admettre tout fait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 contre lui afin de dispenser d\u2019en faire la preuve. Quand il n\u2019y a pas de plaidoyer de culpabilit\u00e9, l\u2019accus\u00e9 ne peut effectivement admettre des all\u00e9gations mixtes de fait et de droit. A mon avis, c\u2019est pour l\u2019avocat du poursuivant une pratique peu souhaitable que de s\u2019abstenir de faire la preuve formelle de l\u2019avis prescrit par le par. (1) de l\u2019art. 662 et de compter sur un aveu oral impr\u00e9cis fait par un accus\u00e9 qui n\u2019est pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat.\nApr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9crit ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, j\u2019ai eu l\u2019avantage de lire les motifs de mon coll\u00e8gue, le juge Pigeon, et je suis enti\u00e8rement d\u2019accord avec lui.\nPour les motifs exprim\u00e9s par mon coll\u00e8gue et pour ceux que j\u2019ai ci-dessus expos\u00e9s, je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir l\u2019appel, d\u2019annuler l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel et le jugement du juge en chef Wilson et d\u2019ordonner qu\u2019un jugement soit enregistr\u00e9 (i) annulant la d\u00e9cision du magistrat que l\u2019appelant est atteint de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle, (ii) annulant la sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive, (iii) annulant le mandat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et (iv) ordonnant que l\u2019appelant soit lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\nJe suis en outre d\u2019avis de d\u00e9livrer en conformit\u00e9 de l\u2019art. 689 du Code criminel un ordre prot\u00e9geant contre toutes proc\u00e9dures civiles le magistrat et les agents qui ont ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 la sentence ou le mandat.\nLe jugement des Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson et Ritchie a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par\nLE JUGE MARTLAND\u2014Le 6 mars 1958, l\u2019appelant comparaissait devant le Magistrat Hunter, \u00e0 Cloverdale, Colombie-Britannique, plaidait coupable \u00e0 une inculpation d\u2019avoir commis, en contravention de l\u2019art. 149 du Code criminel un acte de grossi\u00e8re ind\u00e9cence, et \u00e9tait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable de cet acte criminel. Son dossier indiquait deux condamnations ant\u00e9rieures pour des d\u00e9lits du m\u00eame genre, ce que l\u2019appelant a reconnu \u00eatre exact.\nLe prononc\u00e9 de la sentence a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9 \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure. L\u2019appelant comparaissait \u00e0 nouveau devant le Magistrat le 28 mars 1958. C\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment, selon le dossier, que le procureur de la Couronne a fait part \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de son intention de demander \u00e0 entendre des t\u00e9moignages afin de d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait atteint de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle puisqu\u2019on a requis l\u2019appelant de d\u00e9signer l\u2019un des deux psychiatres qui devaient t\u00e9moigner, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de l\u2019art. 661(2) du Code criminel. L\u2019appelant dit qu\u2019il a demand\u00e9 que son m\u00e9decin personnel recommande un psychiatre de son choix.\nL\u2019enqu\u00eate fut ajourn\u00e9e au 15 avril, et le 15 avril elle fut report\u00e9e au 22 avril. C\u2019est le 22 avril que le Magistrat entendit les t\u00e9moignages; il a alors condamn\u00e9 l\u2019appelant \u00e0 une peine de deux ann\u00e9es de p\u00e9nitencier sur l\u2019accusation port\u00e9e, \u00e0 laquelle celui-ci avait plaid\u00e9 coupable, en plus d\u2019imposer la d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive.\nL\u2019appelant n\u2019interjeta pas appel dans les d\u00e9lais prescrits. En f\u00e9vrier 1964, il faisait une demande de prolongation du d\u00e9lai d\u2019appel. La Cour d\u2019appel a entendu cette demande le 7 mai 1965 et l\u2019a rejet\u00e9e. En septembre 1965, l\u2019appelant fit une requ\u00eate pour bref d\u2019habeas corpus avec certiorari auxiliaire. L\u2019une des all\u00e9gations de sa requ\u00eate se lisait ainsi:\n[TRADUCTION] QUE la Cour n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour entendre une demande faite en vertu de l\u2019art. 661(1)(b), o\u00f9 l\u2019audition a imm\u00e9diatement suivi la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9, parce que l\u2019article qui stipule que la demande doit \u00eatre faite APR\u00c9S la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 et un avis de sept jours francs n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9.\nLa d\u00e9claration sous serment faite par l\u2019appelant \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa requ\u00eate n\u2019indiquait ni o\u00f9 ni quand on lui avait signifi\u00e9 l\u2019avis, et n\u2019invoquait pas non plus d\u2019autre fait pour \u00e9tayer l\u2019all\u00e9gation pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e.\nLors de la pr\u00e9sentation de cette requ\u00eate en premi\u00e8re instance, l\u2019appelant s\u2019\u00e9tait fait repr\u00e9senter par un avocat. La requ\u00eate fut rejet\u00e9e. Lors de l\u2019appel, un avocat agissait \u00e0 titre b\u00e9n\u00e9vole (amicus curiale) et comme procureur de la Couronne. Le rejet a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9.\nLe 31 mars 1966, l\u2019appelant fit une nouvelle demande de prolongation du d\u00e9lai d\u2019appel de l\u2019ordonnance qui le d\u00e9clarait atteint de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle et le condamnait \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive. Cette nouvelle demande fut entendue le 26 mai et rejet\u00e9e le 7 juin. Le Juge en chef a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par \u00e9crit les motifs de la Cour. De ce jugement, je retiens ceci:\n[TRADUCTION] Par suite des all\u00e9gations de Sanders devant cette Cour, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de sa demande de prolongation de d\u00e9lai en 1965, celle-ci a demand\u00e9 au procureur de la Couronne de porter \u00e0 la connaissance du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral les repr\u00e9sentations de Sanders au sujet de l\u2019irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de proc\u00e9dures devant le Magistrat de Cloverdale, en vue de faire mener une enqu\u00eate compl\u00e8te sur les circonstances entourant les proc\u00e9dures devant le Magistrat Hunter. Le procureur de la Couronne a fait part \u00e0 cette Cour, au cours de sa plaidoirie, que le minist\u00e8re du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral avait fait mener l\u2019enqu\u00eate par l\u2019un de ses agents et que le rapport de ce dernier \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des pr\u00e9tentions de Sanders.\nLe Juge Branca, dans les motifs de son jugement sur la requ\u00eate d\u2019habeas corpus mentionn\u00e9e plus haut, a formul\u00e9 des critiques s\u00e9v\u00e8res quant \u00e0 la conduite de l\u2019affaire devant le Magistrat Hunter, se fondant probablement sur des all\u00e9gations de m\u00eame nature que celles qu\u2019avait faites Sanders dans sa premi\u00e8re demande de permission d\u2019en appeler. Toutefois, le Juge Branca a trouv\u00e9 que la preuve des pr\u00e9tendues irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s au niveau des proc\u00e9dures en premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisante pour justifier la conclusion que le Magistrat avait agi sans comp\u00e9tence.\nA l\u2019audition des requ\u00eates courantes devant cette Cour, Sanders a comparu personnellement, disant qu\u2019il ne voulait pas d\u2019un avocat de l\u2019assistance judiciaire et qu\u2019il plaiderait seul. Il invoquait les motifs suivants:\n1. Que la Cour avait le droit d\u2019\u00e9tudier sa cause au fond avant de d\u00e9cider si elle devait accorder une prolongation de d\u00e9lai pour lui permettre d\u2019en appeler.\n2. Que le fond de sa cause justifiait une prolongation de d\u00e9lai parce qu\u2019il ressort d\u2019une nouvelle transcription des proc\u00e9dures faites devant le savant Magistrat le 22 avril 1958, que la transcription fournie \u00e0 cette Cour lors de la premi\u00e8re demande de prolongation de d\u00e9lai \u00e9tait incompl\u00e8te.\n3. Que la renonciation \u00e0 l\u2019appel, sign\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant le 18 mai 1958, n\u2019emp\u00eachait pas la Cour d\u2019accorder une prolongation du d\u00e9lai pour demander l\u2019autorisation d\u2019interjeter appel.\nIl n\u2019invoquait pas d\u2019autre motif.\n* * *\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9tude de la transcription maintenant fournie par Sanders et sp\u00e9cialement d\u2019apr\u00e8s les propos qu\u2019il aurait prononc\u00e9s \u00e0 la fin des proc\u00e9dures du 22 avril, je suis satisfait qu\u2019il n\u2019a subi aucun pr\u00e9judice de la fa\u00e7on dont elles se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9es. Ses propos d\u2019alors, \u00e0 mon avis, permettent de conclure sans aucun doute qu\u2019il ne consid\u00e9rait pas \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 qu\u2019il avait subi un pr\u00e9judice quelconque.\nA cause de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de pr\u00e9judice formul\u00e9e par Sanders, la Cour a jug\u00e9 bon, sur cette demande de prolongation de d\u00e9lai, d\u2019examiner avec soin le dossier des proc\u00e9dures devant le Magistrat. J\u2019en conclus qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de motif qui justifie d\u2019accorder une prolongation de d\u00e9lai \u00e0 l\u2019appelant pour qu\u2019il puisse en appeler de l\u2019ordonnance qui le d\u00e9clare psychopathe sexuel criminel ou de la peine impos\u00e9e par le savant Magistrat.\nLa demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e.\nC\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019audition de cette derni\u00e8re demande que l\u2019appelant a produit pour la premi\u00e8re fois, un avis dat\u00e9 du 31 mars 1958 et adress\u00e9 \u00e0 lui, l\u2019informant qu\u2019on se proposait de demander, le 15 avril 1958, \u00e0 Cloverdale, Colombie-Britan- nique, une audition pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il \u00e9tait atteint de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle. L\u2019avis \u00e9tait sign\u00e9 par A.K. Thompson, procureur de la Couronne.\nLa requ\u00eate qui a donn\u00e9 lieu au pr\u00e9sent pourvoi est une deuxi\u00e8me requ\u00eate d\u2019habeas corpus avec certiorari auxiliaire, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 18 mai 1967. Cette requ\u00eate ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e, l\u2019appel de ce refus a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu par un banc de cinq Juges et a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9. Le Juge d\u2019appel Norris \u00e9tait dissident.\nLe Juge d\u2019appel Tysoe, en donnant les motifs de la Cour, dit:\n[TRADUCTION] La situation dans la cause qui est pr\u00e9sentement devant cette Cour est assez particuli\u00e8re. Une partie du dossier de la Cour du magistrat est introuvable. Les seules pi\u00e8ces disponibles, tant devant le tribunal inf\u00e9rieur que devant nous, sont: le mandat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t, deux transcriptions des proc\u00e9dures devant le Magistrat le 22 avril 1958, l\u2019avis de demande signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant et les d\u00e9clarations sous serment mentionn\u00e9es plus loin.\nLa premi\u00e8re transcription que le st\u00e9nographe officiel a fournie \u00e0 l\u2019appelant est manifestement incompl\u00e8te. La seconde, produite par la Couronne, a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9e par le st\u00e9nographe officiel apr\u00e8s que le Juge Branca eut rendu son jugement. Elle est beaucoup plus compl\u00e8te que la premi\u00e8re et elle est authentiqu\u00e9e: \u00abRapport fid\u00e8le des t\u00e9moignages et des proc\u00e9dures, transcrit d\u2019apr\u00e8s mes notes st\u00e9nographiques prises le 22 avril 1958\u00bb. Au sujet de la signification de l\u2019avis qu\u2019on voulait, devant le Magistrat Hunter, faire une demande de conclusion en vertu de l\u2019art. 661 du Code criminel, on trouve le passage suivant dans la deuxi\u00e8me transcription:\nLE SUBSTITUT: Votre Honneur, vous vous souviendrez qu\u2019en cette affaire \u00e0 l\u2019audition pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente j\u2019ai fait une demande en vertu du paragraphe 1 de l\u2019article 661 du Code criminel, un avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 et il est dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019admettre pour \u00e9viter la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019en faire la preuve.\nLE MAGISTRAT: Alors, M. Sanders, on vous a signifi\u00e9 une copie de cet avis?\nM. SANDERS: C\u2019est exact.\nLE MAGISTRAT: Et, au bas, c\u2019est votre signature par laquelle vous l\u2019admettez?\nM. SANDERS: Oui.\nLE MAGISTRAT: C\u2019est une copie de ce que j\u2019ai en main ici pr\u00e9sentement?\nM. SANDERS: Oui, c\u2019est exact.

Le 28 mars 1958, \u00e0 Cloverdale, dans la province de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, en pr\u00e9sence de Francis Stewart Sanders et de l\u2019avocat de la Couronne, M.A. Kenneth Thompson, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 \u00e0 ma satisfaction que Francis Stewart Sanders avait re\u00e7u un avis \u00e9crit de sept jours francs qu\u2019une demande en vertu de l\u2019art. 661 du Code criminel du Canada, tel qu\u2019il se lisait alors, serait faite pour le faire d\u00e9clarer lui, ledit Francis Stewart Sanders, atteint de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle et le faire condamner \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive.\nLa d\u00e9claration sous serment du substitut Thompson dit que:\n[TRADUCTION] 7. Je me souviens qu\u2019un avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Francis Stewart Sanders de notre intention de le faire d\u00e9clarer atteint de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle et je me souviens avoir prouv\u00e9 en Cour, \u00e0 la satisfaction du Magistrat, qu\u2019un avis lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment donn\u00e9 mais je suis incapable de dire \u00e0 quelle date ledit avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 Francis Stewart Sanders.\nLa d\u00e9claration sous serment du caporal Dempsey, de la Gendarmerie Royale du Canada, se lit comme il suit:\n[TRADUCTION] 4. Avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audition pour faire d\u00e9clarer Francis Stewart Sanders atteint de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle, j\u2019ai personnellement signifi\u00e9 audit Francis Stewart Sanders copie de l\u2019avis de la demande pour le faire d\u00e9clarer atteint de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle.\n5. La dite signification a eu lieu au palais de justice de Cloverdale, dans la municipalit\u00e9 de Surrey, dans la province de la Colombie-Britannique.\n6. Je crois sinc\u00e8rement que j\u2019ai signifi\u00e9 ledit avis audit Francis Stewart Sanders au moins sept jours francs avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audition, parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de la premi\u00e8re demande de cette nature o\u00f9 j\u2019instrumentais et je me rappelle tr\u00e8s bien avoir lu les dispositions des articles 661 et 662 du Code criminel tels qu\u2019ils se lisaient alors, avant de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la signification \u00e0 Francis Stewart Sanders.\nL\u2019appelant a produit une d\u00e9claration sous serment, o\u00f9 il mentionne pour la premi\u00e8re fois l\u2019avis de demande dat\u00e9 du 31 mars 1958, avis qu\u2019il admet avoir re\u00e7u. Cette d\u00e9claration ne sp\u00e9cifie ni o\u00f9 ni quand l\u2019avis lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 et n\u2019affirme pas non plus que l\u2019appelant ne se souvient pas de ces faits. Il dit plut\u00f4t:\n[TRADUCTION] 18. Je n\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 ni oralement, ni par \u00e9crit avant de faire mon choix ou d\u2019enregistrer mon plaidoyer, le 16 mars 1958, qu\u2019une nouvelle accusation serait port\u00e9e contre moi, savoir celle que j\u2019\u00e9tais atteint de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle.\n19. Je n\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 ni oralement, ni par \u00e9crit d\u2019une telle demande avant qu\u2019elle soit faite devant le tribunal, le 28 mars 1958.\n20. Je n\u2019ai pas eu un avis de sept jours francs avant le proc\u00e8s ainsi que la loi le requiert avant que la Cour ait juridiction de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019audition pour d\u00e9cider si l\u2019accus\u00e9 est atteint de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle.\nQuant \u00e0 la question de la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019avis, la d\u00e9claration pr\u00e9sente le raisonnement suivant:\n1. L\u2019appelant n\u2019a eu aucun avis avant le 28 mars 1958.\n2. L\u2019avis est dat\u00e9 du 31 mars 1958.\n3. Le caporal Dempsey d\u00e9clare avoir fait la signification au palais de justice de Cloverdale.\n4. Apr\u00e8s le 28 mars, l\u2019appelant ne s\u2019est trouv\u00e9 au palais de justice que les 15 et 22 avril.\n5. Si l\u2019avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 le 15 ou le 22 avril, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pu avoir un avis de sept jours francs de l\u2019audition tenue le 22 avril.\nLes articles du Code criminel qui s\u2019appliquent ici se lisaient comme il suit au moment de l\u2019audition:\n661. (1) Lorsqu\u2019un accus\u00e9 est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable\n(a) d\u2019une infraction vis\u00e9e par\n(i) l\u2019article 136;\n(ii) l\u2019article 138; (iii) l\u2019article 141;\n(iv) l\u2019article 147;\n(v) l\u2019article 148; ou\n(vi) l\u2019article 149; ou\n(b) d\u2019une tentative de commettre une infraction pr\u00e9vue par une disposition mentionn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a (a),\nla cour peut, sur demande, avant de prononcer sentence, entendre des t\u00e9moignages sur la question de savoir si le d\u00e9linquant est atteint de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle.\n(2) A l\u2019audition d\u2019une demande pr\u00e9vue par le paragraphe (1), la cour peut entendre les t\u00e9moignages qu\u2019elle estime n\u00e9cessaires, mais elle doit entendre les t\u00e9moignages d\u2019au moins deux psychiatres, dont l\u2019un doit \u00eatre nomm\u00e9 par le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\n(3) Lorsque la cour juge que l\u2019accus\u00e9 est atteint de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle, elle doit, nonobstant les dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente loi ou de toute autre loi du Parlement du Canada, lui imposer au moins deux ans d\u2019emprisonnement pour l\u2019infraction dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable et, en plus, imposer une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive.\n662. (1) Les prescriptions suivantes s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des demandes pr\u00e9vues par la pr\u00e9sente Partie, savoir:\n* * *\n(b) une demande selon le paragraphe (1) de l\u2019article 661 ne peut pas \u00eatre entendue, \u00e0 moins que le poursuivant n\u2019en ait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 un avis de sept jours francs et que copie de l\u2019avis n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au bureau du greffier de la cour ou du magistrat, lorsque ce dernier agit sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la partie XVI.\n(2) Une demande pr\u00e9vue par la pr\u00e9sente Partie doit \u00eatre entendue et d\u00e9cid\u00e9e avant le prononc\u00e9 de la sentence pour l\u2019infraction dont l\u2019accus\u00e9 est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable et doit \u00eatre entendue par la cour sans jury.\nCes articles pr\u00e9voient que, lorsqu\u2019une personne est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un des actes criminels y mentionn\u00e9s, la cour qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l\u2019accus\u00e9 coupable peut, avant d\u2019imposer une peine, entendre des t\u00e9moignages suppl\u00e9mentaires afin de d\u00e9terminer si la personne d\u00e9clar\u00e9e coupable est psychopathe sexuel criminel. Si la cour juge que l\u2019accus\u00e9 est psychopathe sexuel criminel, elle doit le condamner \u00e0 une peine d\u2019au moins deux ans \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019acte criminel dont l\u2019accus\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable et en plus imposer la d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive. L\u2019audition des t\u00e9moignages sup- pl\u00e9mentaires ne constitue pas une proc\u00e9dure s\u00e9par\u00e9e, elle constitue une continuation des proc\u00e9dures qui ont amen\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9, telle audition ne servant qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9cider de la peine \u00e0 imposer.\nLa pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate d\u2019habeas corpus avec certiorari auxiliaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par le juge en chef Wilson. Dans son rapport \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel, il motive son jugement de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\n[TRADUCTION] Mon rapport en cette affaire sera bref. La m\u00eame condamnation a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e par M. le Juge Branca sur une pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente requ\u00eate pour habeas corpus avec certiorari auxiliaire et il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le 23 novembre 1965 ses motifs \u00e9crits de rejet. Je ne puis faire mieux. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9 je puis dire que le mandat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t n\u2019\u00e9tant pas contest\u00e9, je ne pouvais voir de motif valable d\u2019accorder l\u2019habeas corpus. Quant au certiorari, il m\u2019a paru exclu par l\u2019article 682 du Code criminel et j\u2019ai aussi consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que la demande devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e pour les motifs donn\u00e9s par le Juge Branca, si\u00e9geant alors en premi\u00e8re instance.\nL\u2019article 682 pr\u00e9voit que:\n682. Aucune condamnation ou ordonnance ne doit \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e par certiorari\n(a) lorsqu\u2019un appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 interjet\u00e9, que l\u2019appel ait \u00e9t\u00e9 ou non poursuivi jusqu\u2019\u00e0 sa conclusion; ou\n(b) lorsque le d\u00e9fendeur a comparu et plaid\u00e9, que l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e au fond, et qu\u2019un appel aurait pu \u00eatre interjet\u00e9, mais que le d\u00e9fendeur ne l\u2019a pas interjet\u00e9.\nEn Cour d\u2019appel, le substitut a admis qu\u2019il y aurait lieu \u00e0 certiorari si le magistrat avait agi sans juridiction, en ce sens que ce dernier n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence ab initio pour entendre la demande de la Couronne si l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas de fait re\u00e7u un avis de sept jours francs.\nLors de la premi\u00e8re audition devant cette Cour, le 5 d\u00e9cembre 1968, celle-ci a demand\u00e9 aux avocats de produire une plaidoirie \u00e9crite sur l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019art. 682. Ces plaidoiries ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produites. L\u2019appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9entendu par la Cour au complet le 2 juin 1969.\nA mon avis, l\u2019art. 682 emp\u00eache d\u2019\u00e9carter l\u2019ordonnance du magistrat par voie de certiorari pour les motifs suivants:\n1. La sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive est une ordonnance. 2. L\u2019appelant a comparu devant le Magistrat et il a plaid\u00e9 coupable \u00e0 l\u2019accusation port\u00e9e contre lui en vertu de l\u2019art. 149. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable de cet acte criminel, la Cour qui l\u2019avait ainsi reconnu coupable avait le pouvoir et l\u2019obligation, si on lui en faisait la demande, d\u2019entendre des t\u00e9moignages suppl\u00e9mentaires pour d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait psychopathe sexuel criminel et d\u2019imposer la peine appropri\u00e9e. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019enregistrer un nouveau plaidoyer en rapport avec cette enqu\u00eate.\n3. L\u2019appelant \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent lors de l\u2019audition des t\u00e9moignages suppl\u00e9mentaires pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il \u00e9tait psychopathe sexuel criminel et l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e au fond.\n4. En vertu de l\u2019art. 667(1) il aurait pu en appeler de la peine de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive, mais il ne l\u2019a pas fait dans les d\u00e9lais prescrits.\nVu les circonstaces de l\u2019affaire, je conclus que l\u2019art. 682(b) du Code s\u2019applique ici.\nL\u2019appelant a toutefois all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019on ne pouvait pas dire \u00abque l\u2019affaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e au fond\u00bb au sens de l\u2019art. 682(b) s\u2019il n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u l\u2019avis de sept jours francs pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019art. 662(1)(b) car, si tel \u00e9tait le cas, la cour \u00e9tait incomp\u00e9tente pour entendre l\u2019affaire, de sorte qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait pas eu de proc\u00e8s.\nSi l\u2019on peut dire que ces dispositions ne s\u2019appliquent que dans les cas o\u00f9 la cour a juridiction, l\u2019art. 682(b) n\u2019a pas de sens. Le bref de certiorari porte principalement sur la question de la comp\u00e9tence du tribunal inf\u00e9rieur. Dans l\u2019affaire R. v. Nat Bell Liquors, Limited[8], au bas de la page 154, Lord Sumner d\u00e9finit l\u2019objet du bref de certiorari de la fa\u00e7on suivante: [TRADUCTION] \u00abSon objet est d\u2019\u00e9tudier les actes du tribunal inf\u00e9rieur et de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019ordonnance rendue \u00e9tait de la comp\u00e9tence de ce dernier.\u00bb\nSi l\u2019objet du certiorari est de d\u00e9terminer si une ordonnance rendue par un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur \u00e9tait de la comp\u00e9tence de celui-ci et s\u2019il y avait lieu \u00e0 certiorari toutes les fois que le tribunal n\u2019a pas juridiction, nonobstant l\u2019art. 682(b), la disposition en question aurait une port\u00e9e tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9e. Si la cour \u00e9tait comp\u00e9tente, il n\u2019y aurait pas lieu \u00e0 certiorari, tout \u00e0 fait ind\u00e9pendamment de l\u2019art. 682. Si la cour n\u2019\u00e9tait pas comp\u00e9tente et si cette interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9tait la bonne, il y aurait lieu \u00e0 certiorari, nonobstant l\u2019art. 682.\nA mon avis, on a voulu que l\u2019article s\u2019applique, et il s\u2019applique de fait \u00e0 cause de ses termes, aux cas o\u00f9, s\u2019il n\u2019existait pas, la comp\u00e9tence du tribunal pourrait \u00eatre contest\u00e9e par voie de certiorari. Si le pr\u00e9venu a comparu devant un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur, s\u2019il a enregistr\u00e9 un plaidoyer, si le tribunal a ensuite jug\u00e9 au fond l\u2019affaire mise en cause par le plaidoyer, et que le pr\u00e9venu veuille faire renverser le jugement du tribunal, il doit, si la loi lui donne le droit d\u2019en appeler, tenter de faire r\u00e9former le jugement par voie d\u2019appel seulement. L\u2019article vise, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il s\u2019applique, \u00e0 emp\u00eacher la coexistence de deux recours et \u00e0 limiter le pourvoi \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019appel lorsque l\u2019appel est permis.\nJe ne n\u00e9glige pas le fait qu\u2019il est possible d\u2019agir par certiorari si le tribunal inf\u00e9rieur a fait d\u00e9faut de se conformer \u00e0 la loi ou a outrepass\u00e9 sa juridiction. Lord Sumner, parlant du droit de regard d\u2019un tribunal sup\u00e9rieur sur les actes du tribunal inf\u00e9rieur dans l\u2019affaire Nat Bell cit\u00e9e plus haut dit, \u00e0 la page 156:\n[TRADUCTION] Ce droit de regard porte sur deux points: d\u2019une part, l\u2019\u00e9tendue, la nature et les conditions d\u2019exercice de la comp\u00e9tence du tribunal inf\u00e9rieur, d\u2019autre part, le respect de la loi dans l\u2019exercice de cette comp\u00e9tence.\nIl n\u2019y a rien, cependant, dans la r\u00e9daction de l\u2019art. 682 qui tende \u00e0 en limiter l\u2019application aux seuls cas o\u00f9 la contestation se fonde sur l\u2019inobservance de la loi dans l\u2019application de la comp\u00e9tence m\u00eame du tribunal, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire l\u2019erreur de droit \u00e9vidente au dossier m\u00eame. Par ses termes m\u00eames, il s\u2019applique, dans tous les cas qui tombent sous le coup de ses dispositions, \u00e0 toute tentative de faire r\u00e9former une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 ou une ordonnance par voie de certiorari.\nEn d\u00e9pit des termes de l\u2019art. 682, qui me paraissent tr\u00e8s clairs, des cours provinciales ont jug\u00e9 que cet article ne constituait pas un obstacle au certiorari dans des affaires qu\u2019on a parfois qualifi\u00e9es d\u2019\u00abexceptionnelles\u00bb. Dans l\u2019affaire. Thibault[9], le Juge Aikins dit, \u00e0 la p. 419:\n[TRADUCTION] L\u2019art. 682 est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 en termes tr\u00e8s clairs et si le Parlement, en l\u2019\u00e9dictant, avait l\u2019intention d\u2019enlever \u00e0 une cour sup\u00e9rieure le droit d\u2019accorder le certiorari partout o\u00f9 l\u2019article s\u2019applique, il est difficile d\u2019imaginer qu\u2019il ait pu choisir des mots plus justes et plus convaincants.\nToutefois, compte tenu de l\u2019opinion de l\u2019avocat de la Couronne selon laquelle, nonobstant les dispositions de l\u2019art. 682, il y a quand m\u00eame lieu \u00e0 certiorari dans certaines circonstances exceptionnelles et \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui veut que, si un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur outrepasse sa comp\u00e9tence, m\u00eame une disposition expresse \u00e0 l\u2019effet d\u2019\u00e9carter le recours au certiorari n\u2019enl\u00e8ve pas \u00e0 une cour sup\u00e9rieure le droit d\u2019exercer ce pouvoir (voir In re Trade Union Act 1944; Bruton v. Regina City Policemen\u2019s Assn., Local N\u00b0 155 (1945) 2 W.W.R. p. 273 (Cour d\u2019appel de la Saskatchewan); Re Toronto Newspaper Guild and Globe Printing Co. (1953) 2 R.C.S. p. 18, 106 C.C.C. p. 225, confirmant (1952) O.R. p. 345, 102 C.C.C. p. 318; et Re Dauphin (Town) and Director of Public Welfare and Close (1955-56) 17 W.W.R. p. 628, 63 Man. R. p. 222, confirm\u00e9 (1956) 19 W.W.R. p. 97, 24 C.R. p. 238). Je m\u2019appuie sur le crit\u00e8re d\u2019apr\u00e8s lequel, dans des circonstances exceptionnelles, il y a lieu \u00e0 certiorari \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9, nonobstant l\u2019art. 682.\nDans l\u2019affaire R. c. Phillips[10], le Juge Hall, alors Juge en chef de la Cour du Banc de la Reine, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il fallait accorder le certiorari dans une affaire o\u00f9 la d\u00e9nonciation \u00e9tait nulle en droit du fait qu\u2019elle \u00e9non\u00e7ait deux infractions, parce que les proc\u00e9dures \u00e9taient nulles ab initio.\nDans l\u2019affaire Krakat[11], le Juge Hughes a conclu que les circonstances \u00e9taient \u00absi exceptionnelles\u00bb que le bref pouvait \u00eatre accord\u00e9 ex debito justitiae. Dans cette affaire, c\u2019est la conduite du proc\u00e8s par le magistrat qui faisait l\u2019objet du grief.\nDans la cause R. c. White[12], le Juge Riley \u00e9crit, \u00e0 la page 357:\n[TRADUCTION] Je crois que, si l\u2019on retient les doctrines des \u00abcirconstances exceptionnelles\u00bb, du \u00abd\u00e9ni de justice\u00bb et de \u00abl\u2019absence totale de comp\u00e9tence\u00bb, la disposition statutaire cit\u00e9e n\u2019enl\u00e8ve pas sa comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 la cour sup\u00e9rieure et que pour le faire, il faudrait que la disposition soit r\u00e9dig\u00e9e en termes beaucoup plus rigoureux.\nCe sont l\u00e0 des exemples d\u2019affaires o\u00f9 le certiorari a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9, malgr\u00e9 les dispositions de l\u2019art. 682. Les \u00abcas exceptionnels\u00bb dont il s\u2019agit comprennent ceux o\u00f9 l\u2019on a trouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait d\u00e9faut de comp\u00e9tence ou d\u00e9ni de justice. En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence envers les opinions qui y sont exprim\u00e9es, il me semble bien, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit plus haut, que ce sont l\u00e0 des cas particuliers o\u00f9 le certiorari est le recours normal. En affirmant que malgr\u00e9 que le Parlement ait, en termes tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, \u00e9dict\u00e9 que le recours au certiorari serait refus\u00e9 au pr\u00e9venu qui a enregistr\u00e9 un plaidoyer, dont l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e au fond et qui pouvait en appeler, le tribunal a encore droit d\u2019accorder le bref, les d\u00e9cisions en question me semblent constituer un refus des tribunaux d\u2019appliquer les dispositions de l\u2019art. 682 aux affaires qu\u2019ils consid\u00e8rent comme \u00abexceptionnelles\u00bb.\nJ\u2019ai cit\u00e9 jusqu\u2019ici des arr\u00eats de tribunaux de premi\u00e8re instance. Je m\u2019arr\u00eaterai maintenant aux d\u00e9cisions des cours d\u2019appel qui traitent de la question. Je me limiterai aux d\u00e9cisions rendues apr\u00e8s 1955, puisque les dispositions de l\u2019art. 682(b) different beaucoup de celles de l\u2019art 1129 de l\u2019ancien Code.\nOn nous a cit\u00e9 deux jugements de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Saskatchewan: R. ex. rel. Lotochinski v. Antonenko[13] et Re Wilfong[14]. Dans ces deux causes, le certiorari a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9. Dans la premi\u00e8re, le Juge d\u2019appel Gordon reprend \u00e0 son compte l\u2019affirmation du Juge McKay dans l\u2019affaire R. ex. rel. Sanderson v. Eremko[15], selon laquelle: [TRADUCTION]. \u00abLorsque on peut en appeler d\u2019une conviction sommaire, il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019accorder le certiorari sauf s\u2019il se trouve des circonstances sp\u00e9ciales\u00bb. Ce jugement date de bien avant la mise en vigueur de l\u2019art. 682(b) et la disposition n\u2019est pas d\u00e9battue dans l\u2019affaire Antonenko. Dans la deuxi\u00e8me affaire cit\u00e9e, l\u2019art. 682 n\u2019est pas analys\u00e9. On y mentionne aussi, \u00e0 la p. 614, l\u2019arr\u00eat de cette Cour dans l\u2019affaire Smith v. R.[16] en ces termes:\n[TRADUCTION] En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne crois pas que le principe adopt\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire Reg. v. Gerald X (ou G.S.) d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9e, soit applicable \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Dans cette cause, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que lorsque la cour a agi sans comp\u00e9tence ou a outrepass\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence, le bref, quoique discr\u00e9tionnaire doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9 ex debito justitiae. A mon avis, il y a une grande diff\u00e9rence entre le cas o\u00f9 le tribunal a agi ainsi et celui o\u00f9 le tribunal a rendu, dans les limites de sa comp\u00e9tence, une d\u00e9cision qui peut \u00eatre contraire \u00e0 la Loi. Voir Rex v. Stafford JJ. (1940) 2 K.B. p. 33, 109 L.J.K.B. p. 584 et Reg. v. Campbell, (1956) 2 All. E.R. p. 280. Dans le premier cas, le recours au certiorari est accord\u00e9 ex debito justitiae, dans l\u2019autre, il n\u2019en est pas n\u00e9cessairement ainsi.\nJ\u2019examinerai les cons\u00e9quences de l\u2019arr\u00eat Smith plus loin.\nLa Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique, dans l\u2019affaire R. v. Fawcus[17], a refus\u00e9 le certiorari, mais elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si l\u2019art. 682 l\u2019en aurait emp\u00each\u00e9. Le Juge d\u2019appel Maclean, qui a donn\u00e9 les motifs de la Cour \u00e9crit, \u00e0 la page 98:\n[TRADUCTION] Vu la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j\u2019en arrive, il ne m\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019art. 682(b) a pour effet d\u2019\u00e9carter le certiorari dans cette affaire. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu que l\u2019article en question ne s\u2019applique pas dans certaines \u00abcirconstances sp\u00e9ciales\u00bb. Tout ce que je peux dire, c\u2019est que je doute qu\u2019il puisse exister de ces \u00abcirconstances sp\u00e9ciales\u00bb, hormis l\u2019absence totale de comp\u00e9tence ab initio, qui feraient que l\u2019art. 682(b) n\u2019ait pas d\u2019effet lorsque le requ\u00e9rant avait un droit d\u2019appel inconditionnel par voie de proc\u00e8s de novo.\nAu Manitoba, dans l\u2019affaire Dauphin (Town) v. Director of Public Welfare[18], le Juge d\u2019appel Schultz, qui donne les motifs de la Cour cite ceux du Juge de premi\u00e8re instance, le Juge DuVal. A la page 101, le Juge Schultz dit:\n[TRADUCTION] Le Juge DuVal exprime son opinion en ces termes:\n\u00abLe bref de certiorari est, en common law un bref de pr\u00e9rogative auquel il est permis de re- courir, nonobstant toute disposition statutaire \u00e0 l\u2019effet contraire, pour faire r\u00e9viser les d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs et r\u00e9former celles-ci selon la loi toutes les fois qu\u2019il y a eu d\u00e9faut, absence ou abus de comp\u00e9tence\u00bb.\nCet \u00e9nonc\u00e9 veut dire que, lorsqu\u2019un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur outrepasse sa comp\u00e9tence, aucun texte du Parlement \u00e0 l\u2019effet contraire n\u2019a pour cons\u00e9quence de restreindre le droit du tribunal sup\u00e9rieur d\u2019accorder le certiorari. L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation litt\u00e9rale de l\u2019art. 682(a) laisse peu de doutes sur le but de la disposition: ce but est d\u2019enlever tout droit au certiorari \u00abLorsqu\u2019un appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 interjet\u00e9\u00bb. On s\u2019est rarement servi de mots plus clairs et plus pr\u00e9cis pour examiner le but du l\u00e9gislateur. N\u00e9anmoins, une \u00e9tude de la jurisprudence semble d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e par le Juge DuVal est la bonne. Il cite l\u2019opinion \u00e9mise par le Juge en chef Martin de la Saskatchewan dans l\u2019affaire Bruton v. Regina City Policemen\u2019s Association (1945) 2. W.W.R. p. 273, opinion souvent reprise et suivie depuis, o\u00f9 le savant Juge en chef dit, \u00e0 la p. 283:\n\u00abAu Canada, on a bien des fois jug\u00e9 que la suppression explicite dans une loi du recours au certiorari n\u2019enl\u00e8ve pas \u00e0 la Cour le droit d\u2019\u00e9mettre un tel bref ou d\u2019annuler une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 si les magistrats ont agi sans comp\u00e9tence, parce que, dans un tel cas, le tribunal inf\u00e9rieur ne se trouvait pas vis\u00e9 par la disposition qui supprime le recours au certiorari; m\u00eame des dispositions explicites n\u2019enl\u00e8vent pas \u00e0 un tribunal sup\u00e9rieur son droit de regard s\u2019il y a eu d\u00e9faut de comp\u00e9tence de la part du tribunal inf\u00e9rieur\u00bb.\nCette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie dans nombre d\u2019autres affaires qui sont rapport\u00e9es au Tremeear\u2019s Supplement d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9, \u00e0 la p. 360. Le Juge DuVal mentionne en particulier l\u2019affaire In re Toronto Newspaper Guild and Globe Printing Co. (1953) 2 R.C.S. p. 18 et conclut:\n\u00abIl semblerait qu\u2019une interdiction qui n\u2019enl\u00e8ve pas express\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure le droit qui lui appartient en propre d\u2019exercer ce recours tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9cial qu\u2019est le certiorari ne s\u2019applique pas si le tribunal inf\u00e9rieur ou administratif a outrepass\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence ou a refus\u00e9 de l\u2019exercer\u00bb.\nPour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cet argument, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re l\u2019opinion du Juge d\u2019appel Laidlaw, de la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario, relat\u00e9e dans l\u2019affaire R. v. Kennedy[19]:\n[TRADUCTION] On peut dire, pour commencer, qu\u2019une disposition \u00e9cartant le certiorari telle que celle de l\u2019art. 682 n\u2019a pas pour but de valider les proc\u00e9dures menant \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 une ordonnance de la cour, si la cour n\u2019avait pas juridiction; ce n\u2019est pas dans ce but qu\u2019on l\u2019a ins\u00e9r\u00e9 au Code. Cet article du Code n\u2019entend pas couvrir le tribunal inf\u00e9rieur ni admettre un d\u00e9ni de justice par le pr\u00e9tendu exercice d\u2019une comp\u00e9tence. Mais je crois que le but vis\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 682(b) \u00e9tait d\u2019emp\u00eacher une personne qui veut se soustraire \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 une ordonnance d\u2019un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur et la faire renverser d\u2019avoir deux recours possibles, au choix.\nLorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question, \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel, de savoir si l\u2019art. 682 s\u2019appliquait, on a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 comme dans l\u2019affaire Dauphin v. Director of Public Welfare (d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9e) \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Toronto Newspaper Guild, Local 87, American Newspaper Guild v. Globe Printing Company[20]. Dans cette affaire-l\u00e0, la Cour jugeait des actes d\u2019une commission administrative cr\u00e9\u00e9e en vertu d\u2019une loi intitul\u00e9e The Labour Relations Act (Ont.), c. 51 et qui stipulait que les ordonnances, d\u00e9cisions et d\u00e9crets de la Commission seraient d\u00e9finitifs et ne seraient pas sujets \u00e0 r\u00e9vision par certiorari ou autrement.\nLe Juge Kerwin, alors juge pu\u00een\u00e9 de la Cour Supr\u00eame, disait, \u00e0 la p. 23:\n[TRADUCTION] Nous partons du principe que, lorsque un corps l\u00e9gislatif souverain cr\u00e9e un tribunal administratif, il entend que ce tribunal reste dans les limites de sa comp\u00e9tence. En Angleterre et au Canada, on a constamment jug\u00e9 qu\u2019une cour sup\u00e9rieure a le droit et l\u2019obligation de veiller \u00e0 ce qu\u2019un tribunal tel que la Commission des relations ouvri\u00e8res de l\u2019Ontario n\u2019agisse pas sans comp\u00e9tence.\nCet \u00e9nonc\u00e9 s\u2019accorde avec celui de nombre d\u2019arr\u00eats selon lesquels l\u2019inclusion dans une loi d\u2019un article d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant que les arr\u00eats d\u2019un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur seront d\u00e9finitifs n\u2019a pas pour effet de permettre \u00e0 celui-ci d\u2019outrepasser dans ses propres d\u00e9cisions sa comp\u00e9tence statutaire. Ce principe se fonde, comme le Juge Kerwin le signale, sur la pr\u00e9somption que le corps l\u00e9gislatif qui cr\u00e9e un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur n\u2019entend pas permettre \u00e0 celui-ci d\u2019outrepasser la comp\u00e9tence qu\u2019il lui assigne en vertu de sa loi organique, m\u00eame si cette loi veut rendre ses d\u00e9cisions d\u00e9finitives. L\u2019art. 682 du Code criminel fait partie d\u2019un code complet de lois p\u00e9nales, il se trouve \u00e0 la Partie XXIII que le Parlement a consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019application, en droit p\u00e9nal, des recours extraordinaires que sont le certiorari, l\u2019habeas corpus, le mandamus et la prohibition. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une disposition d\u2019irr\u00e9vocabilit\u00e9. Il n\u2019y est pas question de permettre \u00e0 un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur d\u2019outrepasser sa comp\u00e9tence ni de d\u00e9cider lui-m\u00eame de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive des questions touchant sa propre comp\u00e9tence. Il dit ceci: si quelqu\u2019un a interjet\u00e9 appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision, il n\u2019aura pas droit au certiorari. Il \u00e9dicte en plus que si une personne a enregistr\u00e9 un plaidoyer, si l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e au fond, s\u2019il y avait un droit d\u2019appel de la d\u00e9cision rendue, et s\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9, cette personne ne peut ensuite se pourvoir par certiorari.\nUn pr\u00e9venu qui conteste la comp\u00e9tence du tribunal qui se pr\u00e9pare \u00e0 le juger peut faire objection \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du tribunal et refuser d\u2019enregistrer un plaidoyer. Dans ces conditions il peut avoir recours au ceriorari. S\u2019il enregistre un plaidoyer, l\u2019affaire est jug\u00e9e au fond par la suite et il a droit d\u2019en appeler; il ne peut alors contester la comp\u00e9tence du tribunal que par voie d\u2019appel.\nIl n\u2019y a aucun doute quant au pouvoir du Parlement de limiter de cette fa\u00e7on le droit \u00e0 un recours extraordinaire et c\u2019est ce qu\u2019il a fait en termes clairs. Il n\u2019est pas non plus permis de pr\u00e9tendre que le Parlement a voulu que le certiorari serve \u00e0 forcer un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 rester dans les limites de sa comp\u00e9tence, parce qu\u2019il est \u00e9vident que le but de l\u2019art. 682 est d\u2019en arriver \u00e0 cette fin par la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019appel, lorsque celui-ci est possible, et non par le certiorari.\nCette opinion va-t-elle \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019arr\u00eat de cette Cour dans l\u2019affaire Smith v. R. (d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9e)? Je ne le crois pas. Cette affaire portait sur la conclusion d\u2019un juge de la Cour pour jeunes d\u00e9linquants de Winnipeg \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait un d\u00e9linquant. Une demande en cassation du jugement sans la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019un bref de certiorari fut rejet\u00e9e, rejet qui fut confirm\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019appel. L\u2019appelant porta sa cause devant cette Cour, qui accueillit l\u2019appel. J\u2019ai \u00e9tudi\u00e9 les factums produits et constat\u00e9 que l\u2019application possible de l\u2019art. 682 \u00e0 l\u2019affaire en question n\u2019y est pas soulev\u00e9e. Il n\u2019est pas fait mention de l\u2019article dans les motifs du jugement de cette Cour et la possibilit\u00e9 que l\u2019art. 682 s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019affaire n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 envisag\u00e9e. Je ne crois pas que l\u2019article aurait pu \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s parce qu\u2019il appert clairement qu\u2019on n\u2019avait pas donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019enfant l\u2019occasion d\u2019enregistrer un plaidoyer et que de fait il ne l\u2019avait pas fait.\nOn a aussi cit\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire Crane v. Director of Public Prosecutions[21], comme exemple d\u2019annulation d\u2019un proc\u00e8s qui s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9roul\u00e9 devant un tribunal comp\u00e9tent. Il s\u2019agissait de deux pr\u00e9venus accus\u00e9s s\u00e9par\u00e9ment qui avaient subi leur proc\u00e8s ensemble. La Court of Criminal Appeal et la Chambre des Lords ont toutes deux conclu que le proc\u00e8s \u00e9tait nul.\nLes circonstances de cette affaire ne se retrouvent pas dans celle qui nous occupe pr\u00e9sentement, mais elle est int\u00e9ressante \u00e0 noter parce que la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 laquelle on a eu recours pour obtenir le jugement est celle de l\u2019appel de la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9. Si Crane n\u2019avait pas exerc\u00e9 son droit d\u2019appel, sa condamnation, bien qu\u2019elle ait r\u00e9sult\u00e9 d\u2019un proc\u00e8s d\u00e9clar\u00e9 nul en appel, n\u2019aurait pas pu \u00eatre autrement contest\u00e9e, puisqu\u2019on sait que dans cette cause, entendue devant un \u00abrecorder\u00bb des Quarter Sessions, le recours au certiorari \u00e9tait impossible. (R. v. Boaler[22], R. v. Justice of the Central Criminal Court[23], R. v. Chairman, County of London Quarter Sessions[24]).\nMon interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019art. 682 n\u2019implique pas n\u00e9cessairement que le Parlement ait voulu valider ce qui est nul. Pour \u00e9tablir que des proc\u00e9dures nulles en elles-m\u00eames sont effectivement nulles, comme dans l\u2019affaire Crane, il faut n\u00e9cessairement s\u2019adresser par quelque moyen \u00e0 un tribunal sup\u00e9rieur. Le Parlement a parfaitement le droit de d\u00e9terminer ce moyen, et, \u00e0 mon avis, \u00e0 l\u2019art. 682 il dit clairement que, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 l\u2019article s\u2019applique, ce moyen est l\u2019appel et l\u2019appel seulement. Je ne crois pas que cette interpr\u00e9tation entra\u00eene les cons\u00e9quences monstrueuses (monstrous consequences) dont parle lord Kenyon en rapport avec un article de la loi de faillite analys\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire Fowler v. Padget[25]. Cependant, quelles que soient les cons\u00e9quences, je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il appartient au Parlement de les appr\u00e9cier et de modifier le texte si n\u00e9cessaire.\nJe crois que l\u2019art. 682(b) constitue un obstacle, dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, \u00e0 la cassation de l\u2019ordonnance par voie de certiorari.\nVu la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j\u2019en arrive, il ne m\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e, savoir si, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des dispositions de l\u2019art. 691 du Code criminel, cette Cour a juridiction pour accueillir l\u2019appel du jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel refusant le certiorari.\nL\u2019autre point \u00e0 d\u00e9cider est celui de l\u2019appel du refus d\u2019accorder le bref d\u2019habeas corpus. L\u2019appelant a ici droit d\u2019appel expr\u00e8s, en vertu de l\u2019art. 691(3) du Code criminel. On a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 de la part de l\u2019appelant que le mandat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e9tait d\u00e9fectueux en ce qu\u2019il ne mentionnait pas que le Magistrat avait acquis juridiction du fait que la poursuite avait signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant l\u2019avis de sept jours francs de la demande requis par l\u2019art. 662(1)(b) du Code criminel.\nLe mandat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t se lit comme suit:\n[TRADUCTION] Attendu que Francis Stewart SANDERS, ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9 le \u00abpr\u00e9venu\u00bb, a \u00e9t\u00e9 ce jour d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable sur une inculpation d\u2019avoir lui ledit Francis Stewart SANDERS, entre le 1er d\u00e9cembre 1957 et le 1er mars 1958, \u00e0 ou pr\u00e8s de Newton, C.-B., dans la municipalit\u00e9 de Surrey, \u00e9tant de sexe masculin, ill\u00e9galement commis un acte de grossi\u00e8re ind\u00e9cence avec Roy Flack, une autre personne de sexe masculin, contrairement \u00e0 la loi applicable en ce cas.\nAttendu que ledit Francis Stewart SANDERS a \u00e9t\u00e9, suivant l\u2019article 661 du Code criminel du Canada, d\u00e9clar\u00e9 atteint de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle et qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le pr\u00e9venu pour son infraction soit enferm\u00e9 dans le p\u00e9nitencier de la Colombie\u2011Britannique \u00e0 New Westminster pour la p\u00e9riode de deux (2) ans, et en plus qu\u2019il lui soit impos\u00e9 une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive. Il s\u2019agit simplement de savoir s\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de mentionner aussi qu\u2019on lui avait signifi\u00e9 un avis de sept jours francs de la demande. Aucun des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents qu\u2019ont invoqu\u00e9s les avocats de l\u2019appelant ne l\u2019affirme: la formule 18, \u00e0 la Partie XXVI du Code ne para\u00eet pas faire de cette mention une exigence n\u00e9cessaire du mandat de d\u00e9p\u00f4t. A mon avis, cet argument n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9.\nM\u00eame en admettant que l\u2019art. 682(b) n\u2019emp\u00eache pas de proc\u00e9der par voies de certiorari, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel n\u2019est pas recevable au fond.\nIl n\u2019y a aucun doute que le Magistrat avait comp\u00e9tence pour entendre et juger de la demande de la Couronne, soit qu\u2019il d\u00e9termine avant le prononc\u00e9 de la sentence si l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait atteint de psychopathie sexuelle criminelle. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une affaire o\u00f9 la cour a pr\u00e9tendu juger d\u2019une question sur laquelle elle n\u2019avait pas l\u00e9galement pouvoir de statuer. Le Magistrat ne devait pas entendre la demande \u00e0 moins qu\u2019on ait signifi\u00e9 un avis de sept jours francs \u00e0 l\u2019appelant.\nLe 22 avril 1958, avant d\u2019entendre aucun t\u00e9moignage en rapport avec la demande, l\u2019avocat de la poursuite a avis\u00e9 le magistrat, en pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019appelant, que l\u2019avis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant qui \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 en admettre la signification pour dispenser la Couronne d\u2019en faire preuve. L\u2019appelant a alors admis avoir eu signification de l\u2019avis \u00e9crit, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit comme pi\u00e8ce au dossier. Le magistrat savait \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 que l\u2019appelant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 averti, le 28 mars, que la Couronne entendait pr\u00e9senter une telle demande puisque c\u2019est \u00e0 cette date qu\u2019on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de d\u00e9signer l\u2019un des deux psychiatres dont le t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire, ce que l\u2019appelant admet. Dans les circonstances, le magistrat \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 de pr\u00e9sumer, ce qu\u2019il a sans doute fait, qu\u2019on avait rempli toutes les formalit\u00e9s concernant l\u2019avis.\nSi l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas admis la signification de l\u2019avis et si la preuve de cette signification n\u2019avait pas \u00e9tabli la suffisance de celui-ci, le magistrat aurait ajourn\u00e9 l\u2019audition jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019un avis en r\u00e8gle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9.\nA la lumi\u00e8re de ces faits, il incombait \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, lors de sa demande de bref de certiorari, en mai 1967 (fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019insuffisance de l\u2019avis), d\u2019\u00e9tablir le fait par une preuve positive et certaine. Il a admis avoir re\u00e7u l\u2019avis, mais il n\u2019a pas dit quand il l\u2019a re\u00e7u. Il n\u2019a pas dit o\u00f9 celui-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9. Il n\u2019a pas dit non plus qu\u2019il ne se souvenait plus o\u00f9 ni quand il l\u2019a re\u00e7u. Il all\u00e8gue seulement, par d\u00e9duction, qu\u2019en s\u2019appuyant sur la d\u00e9claration sous serment du caporal Dempsey quant \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de la signification et sur sa propre d\u00e9claration quant aux dates o\u00f9 il s\u2019est trouv\u00e9 \u00e0 cet endroit, il ne peut avoir re\u00e7u un avis de sept jours francs.\nPour contredire cette all\u00e9gation, nous avons la d\u00e9claration sous serment du Magistrat o\u00f9 il affirme qu\u2019il \u00e9tait satisfait qu\u2019on avait donn\u00e9 un avis de sept jours francs et celle du substitut \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il avait \u00e9tabli \u00e0 la satisfaction du Magistrat que l\u2019avis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement signifi\u00e9 et celle du caporal Dempsey qui se rappelle avoir lu les exigences de l\u2019article quant \u00e0 l\u2019avis et qui y dit sa conviction qu\u2019il y a eu un avis d\u2019au moins sept jours.\nLa copie de l\u2019avis que l\u2019appelant a produite comme \u00e9tant celle qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e est dat\u00e9e du 31 mars 1958 et mentionne que demande sera faite en vertu de l\u2019art. 662(1) du Code criminel le 15 avril 1958, \u00e0 la salle d\u2019audience, \u00c9difice municipal, \u00e0 Cloverdale (C.-B.). La pr\u00e9tention soulev\u00e9e par la d\u00e9claration de l\u2019appelant est \u00e0 l\u2019effet que, si celle du caporal Dempsey quant \u00e0 la signification \u00e0 l\u2019appelant \u00e0 Cloverdale est exacte, cette signification a eu lieu soit le 15 soit le 22 avril 1958. Cependant, cette affirmation implique aussi que, bien que le caporal Dempsey ait lu les prescriptions relatives \u00e0 l\u2019avis qui doit \u00eatre de sept jours francs, il aurait n\u00e9anmoins signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant le jour m\u00eame mentionn\u00e9 dans l\u2019avis comme date de l\u2019audition ou une semaine apr\u00e8s cette date. En l\u2019absence de toute d\u00e9claration de l\u2019appelant quant \u00e0 l\u2019endroit et au moment de la signification, je trouve ceci difficile \u00e0 croire.\nJe souscris aux motifs exprim\u00e9s par le Juge d\u2019appel Tysoe, qui a rendu le jugement au nom de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour d\u2019appel et a dit:\n[TRADUCTION] Je crois qu\u2019il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019une affaire o\u00f9 l\u2019appelant avait sp\u00e9cialement \u00e0 fournir une preuve convaincante de son all\u00e9gation qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas eu un avis de sept jours francs. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, je ne doute nullement qu\u2019il sache tr\u00e8s bien o\u00f9 et quand il a eu signification de l\u2019avis. Toutefois, il n\u2019a pas jug\u00e9 bon de d\u00e9clarer ces faits sous serment. A la lumi\u00e8re des circonstances, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas apport\u00e9 une preuve suffisamment convaincante pour justifier la Cour de trouver qu\u2019il s\u2019est d\u00e9charg\u00e9 du fardeau de la preuve, fardeau qui reposait sur lui.\nEn cons\u00e9quence, je rejetterais l\u2019appel.\nLE JUGE HALL (dissident)\u2014Je souscris enti\u00e8rement aux motifs exprim\u00e9s par mon coll\u00e8gue, le Juge en chef. Je n\u2019ai que quelques points \u00e0 souligner quant \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et au sens de l\u2019art. 682 du Code criminel. Cet article se lit comme suit:\n682. Aucune condamnation ou ordonnance ne doit \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e par certiorari\n(a) lorsque un appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 interjet\u00e9, que l\u2019appel ait \u00e9t\u00e9 ou non poursuivi jusqu\u2019\u00e0 sa conclusion; ou\n(b) lorsque le d\u00e9fendeur a comparu et plaid\u00e9, que l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e au fond, et qu\u2019un appel aurait pu \u00eatre interjet\u00e9, mais que le d\u00e9fendeur ne l\u2019a pas interjet\u00e9.\nL\u2019interpr\u00e9tation selon laquelle cet article refuse le droit de faire \u00e9carter l\u2019ordonnance dont il est question ici \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 dire qu\u2019une personne trouv\u00e9e coupable par suite d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure entach\u00e9e de nullit\u00e9 n\u2019a pas de recours par voie de certiorari si un appel aurait pu \u00eatre interjet\u00e9. Je ne puis accepter cette interpr\u00e9tation. A mon avis, l\u2019art. 682 n\u2019entra\u00eene pas cette conclusion. Je refuse de pr\u00eater une telle intention au Parlement. Je crois que lorsque le l\u00e9gislateur a dit: \u00ablorsque le d\u00e9fendeur a comparu et plaid\u00e9, que l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e au fond\u00bb il entendait dire un proc\u00e8s ou une audition r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, non une proc\u00e9dure nulle au point de vue juridique.\nLe l\u00e9gislateur a sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 que l\u2019article s\u2019applique lorsque:\n(1) un appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 interjet\u00e9; ou\n(2) (a) le d\u00e9fendeur a comparu;\n(b) le d\u00e9fendeur a plaid\u00e9;\n(c) l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e au fond;\n(d) un appel aurait pu \u00eatre interjet\u00e9.\nChacune des conditions \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es doit \u00eatre satisfaite. Dans ce cas-ci, comme le signale le Juge en chef, aucun plaidoyer n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 et il n\u2019y avait aucune disposition \u00e0 cet effet. Ce fait est \u00e0 retenir. L\u2019article 682 ne s\u2019applique que lorsque toutes les conditions qu\u2019il impose sont remplies.\nOn dit qu\u2019en \u00e9dictant l\u2019art. 682 le Parlement a arr\u00eat\u00e9, en des termes tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, que le certiorari serait refus\u00e9 si les conditions mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 cet article \u00e9taient remplies. Je reconnais que les termes employ\u00e9s dans l\u2019art. 682 sont tr\u00e8s explicites, mais ils ne sont pas plus explicites, ni n\u2019ont un sens plus large que ceux qu\u2019on trouve dans bien des lois qui renferment des dispositions privatives. La loi intitul\u00e9e Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202 en est un exemple. L\u2019art. 80 de cette loi se lit comme suit:\n[TRADUCTION] Aucune d\u00e9cision, ordonnance, directive, d\u00e9claration ou sentence de la Commission ne pourra faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une contestation ou d\u2019une r\u00e9vision dans ou par aucune cour; aucune cour ne pourra rendre d\u2019ordonnance, ni permettre aucune action ou proc\u00e9dure par voie d\u2019injonction, de jugement d\u00e9claratoire, de certiorari, de mandamus, de prohibition, de quo warranto ou autrement visant \u00e0 contester ou \u00e0 faire r\u00e9viser les d\u00e9cisions de la Commission ou \u00e0 lui d\u00e9fendre ou \u00e0 l\u2019emp\u00eacher de faire quelqu\u2019acte que ce soit.\nOn en trouve un autre exemple dans la loi intitul\u00e9e Trade Union Act 1944, 2e session, c. 69 (Sask.), dont parlait le Juge en chef Martin de la Saskatchewan dans la cause Bruton v. Regina City Policemen\u2019s Association[26]:\n[TRADUCTION] L\u2019art. 15 de la Loi stipule qu\u2019il n\u2019y aura pas d\u2019appel des ordonnances de la Commission et que lesdites ordonnances ne seront pas sujettes \u00e0 r\u00e9vision par voie de certiorari. La suppression, par le l\u00e9gislateur, du recours au certiorari ne joue pas dans tous les cas. Il est en effet clairement \u00e9tabli par la jurisprudence que, nonobstant qu\u2019une loi contienne une disposition supprimant le recours au certiorari, les tribunaux auront quand m\u00eame recours \u00e0 ce bref si la condamnation ou l\u2019ordonnance dont on appelle d\u00e9passe la comp\u00e9tence de l\u2019organisme qui l\u2019a prononc\u00e9e ou rendue. Dans la cause Colonial Bank of Australasia v. Willan, (1874) L.R. 5 P.C. p. 417, 43 L.J.P.C. p. 39, sir James W. Colville, en donnant l\u2019opinion du Comit\u00e9 judiciaire du Conseil priv\u00e9, analyse la jurisprudence apr\u00e8s avoir conclu que la loi en cause enlevait aux tribunaux le droit de d\u00e9livrer des brefs de certiorari. Voir aussi Rex v. Nat Bell Liquors, Ltd, (1922) 2 W.W.R. p. 30, (1922) 2 A.C. p. 128, 91 L.J.P.C. p. 146, 37 C.C.C. p. 129; Laws of England de Halsbury, 2e \u00e9d. vol. 9, p. 862; Municipal Corporations de Dillon, 5e \u00e9dition, vol. 4, p. 2791.\nAu Canada, on a bien des fois jug\u00e9 que la suppression explicite dans une loi du recours au certiorari n\u2019enl\u00e8ve pas \u00e0 la Cour le droit d\u2019\u00e9mettre un tel bref ou d\u2019annuler une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 si les magistrats ont agi sans comp\u00e9tence parce que, dans un tel cas, le tribunal inf\u00e9rieur ne se trouvait pas vis\u00e9 par la disposition qui supprime le recours au certiorari; m\u00eame des dispositions explicites n\u2019enl\u00e8vent pas \u00e0 un tribunal sup\u00e9rieur son droit de regard s\u2019il y a un d\u00e9faut de comp\u00e9tence de la part du tribunal inf\u00e9rieur. Voir Rex v. Collier (1917) 51 N.S.R. p. 64, 28 C.C.C. p. 87; Rex v. Slipp, Ex parte Monahan (1928) 54 N.B.R. p. 550, 51 C.C.C. p. 15; Rex v. Cook, (1908) 18 O.L.R. p. 215, 14 C.C.C. p. 495, (motifs du Juge Anglin \u00e0 la p. 499); Rex v. Yarrow (1922) 51 O.R.L. p. 509, 38 C.C.C. p. 269, (motifs du Juge en chef (Common Pleas) Meredith, p. 271); Rex v. Richmond (1917) 2 W.W.R. p. 1200, 12 Alta. L.R. p. 133, 29 C.C.C. p. 89, (motifs du Juge Stuart, p. 1204).\nLes termes explicites de l\u2019art. 80 de la loi intitul\u00e9e Labour Relations Act, cit\u00e9 plus haut, n\u2019ont pas emp\u00each\u00e9 cette Cour, dans la cause Jarvis v. Associated Medical Services Inc.[27], d\u2019exercer son droit de regard par voie de certiorari quand elle eut jug\u00e9 que le tribunal inf\u00e9rieur avait exc\u00e9d\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence ou que cette derni\u00e8re lui faisait d\u00e9faut. Je ne crois pas qu\u2019il serait logique de pr\u00e9tendre que l\u2019art. 682 constitue un obstacle absolu au certiorari dans une cause o\u00f9 la libert\u00e9 humaine est en jeu quand on ne consid\u00e8re pas que des dispositions tout aussi explicites \u00e0 l\u2019effet de supprimer ce recours dans les lois r\u00e9gissant les relations de travail peuvent avoir cet effet. Le Juge Cartwright, alors Juge pu\u00een\u00e9, disait dans Jarvis, \u00e0 la page 502:\n[TRADUCTION] Les dispositions de cet article, si on l\u2019interpr\u00e8te de la fa\u00e7on la plus favorable \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, ont pour effet d\u2019\u00e9carter la comp\u00e9tence des tribunaux sup\u00e9rieurs vis-\u00e0-vis toute d\u00e9cision de la Commission, si celle-ci agit dans les limites de la comp\u00e9tence qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative. A l\u2019in- t\u00e9rieur de ces limites, elle peut commettre des erreurs de fait ou de droit. Mais il m\u2019est impossible d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019article de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 lui faire dire que si la Commission pr\u00e9tend rendre une d\u00e9cision qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence de rendre au sens de la Loi, l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 reste sans recours\u2026\nLa teneur des termes ne peut emp\u00eacher cette Cour de d\u00e9cider si le tribunal qui a rendu l\u2019ordonnance en cause \u00e9tait comp\u00e9tent ou non; en d\u2019autres mots, la comp\u00e9tence assum\u00e9e par le tribunal inf\u00e9rieur peut toujours \u00eatre mise en question. Il faut n\u00e9cessairement en conclure que s\u2019il y a eu d\u00e9faut de comp\u00e9tence il ne peut y avoir eu de jugement au fond au sens de l\u2019art. 682.\nMon coll\u00e8gue, le Juge Martland, d\u00e9clare dans ses motifs qu\u2019il opte pour le point de vue exprim\u00e9 par le Juge d\u2019appel Laidlaw, de la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario, dans la cause R. v. Kennedy[28], o\u00f9 le savant Juge d\u2019appel dit qu\u2019il est d\u2019avis:\n[TRADUCTION] \u2026que le but vis\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 682(b) \u00e9tait d\u2019emp\u00eacher une personne qui veut se soustraire \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 une ordonnance d\u2019un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur et la faire infirmer d\u2019avoir deux recours possibles, au choix.\nDans la cause Kennedy, la juridiction du magistrat pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e. Dans la requ\u00eate pour l\u2019\u00e9mission d\u2019un bref de certiorari, on all\u00e9guait que le magistrat avait perdu juridiction du fait que: (1) il n\u2019y avait pas eu de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e; (2) la condamnation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e apr\u00e8s un ajournement de plus de huit jours; (3) le proc\u00e8s avait \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9 sans motif raisonnable ni probable et men\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on malicieuse. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 \u00e0 fond le dossier du proc\u00e8s et la transcription des proc\u00e9dures devant le magistrat, le Juge d\u2019appel Laidlaw a conclu qu\u2019il y avait eu en fait un jugement au fond \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le plaidoyer de culpabilit\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 par l\u2019avocat de Kennedy en pr\u00e9sence de ce dernier et confirm\u00e9 par Kennedy lui-m\u00eame lorsque le magistrat lui a pos\u00e9 la question directement. Il semble donc clair que la d\u00e9claration du Juge d\u2019appel Laidlaw allait au del\u00e0 de ce qui \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour d\u00e9cider de la cause et doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un obiter dictum. De toute \u00e9vidence, le Juge d\u2019appel Laidlaw n\u2019entendait pas donner une interpr\u00e9tation d\u00e9finitive de l\u2019art. 682(b) puisqu\u2019il fait pr\u00e9c\u00e9der l\u2019opinion rapport\u00e9e plus haut de ceci:\n[TRADUCTION] A mon avis, le premier point \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer dans le pr\u00e9sent appel est celui de savoir si l\u2019accus\u00e9 avait le droit de porter la cause se trouvant devant magistrat au tribunal sup\u00e9rieur, par voie de certiorari. L\u2019art. 682(b) du Code criminel stipule express\u00e9ment qu\u2019aucune condamnation ou ordonnance ne doit \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e par certiorari \u00ablorsque le d\u00e9fendeur a comparu et plaid\u00e9, que l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e au fond, et qu\u2019un appel aurait pu \u00eatre interjet\u00e9\u00bb. On peut dire, pour commencer, qu\u2019une disposition \u00e9cartant le certiorari telle que celle de l\u2019art. 682 n\u2019a pas pour but de valider les proc\u00e9dures menant \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 une ordonnance de la cour, si la cour n\u2019avait pas juridiction; ce n\u2019est pas dans ce but qu\u2019on l\u2019a ins\u00e9r\u00e9 au Code. Cet article du Code n\u2019entend pas couvrir le tribunal inf\u00e9rieur ni admettre un d\u00e9ni de justice par le pr\u00e9tendu exercice d\u2019une comp\u00e9tence. (Les italiques sont de moi.)\nLes deux derni\u00e8res phrases indiquent que selon le Juge d\u2019appel Laidlaw l\u2019art. 682(b) ne posait pas un obstacle absolu au certiorari, sauf dans les cas o\u00f9 l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e au fond et o\u00f9 un appel aurait pu \u00eatre interjet\u00e9.\nOn n\u2019a qu\u2019\u00e0 se reporter aux conditions rigoureuses qui doivent \u00eatre satisfaites pour en appeler du jugement d\u2019une cour des poursuites sommaires en vertu des art. 722 et 724 du Code criminel (voir R. v. Perehudoff[29], qui suivait Dennis v. The Queen[30]) pour constater comment l\u2019obiter dictum du Juge d\u2019appel Laidlaw est erronn\u00e9 en tant que principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nPar exemple, l\u2019art. 724(1)(b) se lit comme suit:\n724. (1) Les dispositions suivantes s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des appels interjet\u00e9s \u00e0 la cour d\u2019appel, savoir:\n* * *\n(b) Lorsqu\u2019un appel est port\u00e9 d\u2019une condamnation ou d\u2019une ordonnance qui prescrit le paiement d\u2019une amende ou d\u2019une somme d\u2019argent et impose une p\u00e9riode d\u2019emprisonnement \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de paiement, l\u2019appelant doit (i) demeurer sous garde jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019appel soit entendu,\n(ii) contracter un engagement, ou\n(iii) d\u00e9poser aupr\u00e8s de la cour des poursuites sommaires le montant de l\u2019amende ou de la somme d\u2019argent \u00e0 payer et un montant suppl\u00e9mentaire qui, de l\u2019avis de la cour des poursuites sommaires, suffit \u00e0 couvrir les frais de l\u2019appel;\u2026\nIl en r\u00e9sulte qu\u2019une personne cens\u00e9ment condamn\u00e9e par une cour des poursuites sommaires \u00e0 payer une amende, disons de $500 et, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de paiement de l\u2019amende \u00e0 une peine de six mois d\u2019emprisonnement doit, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019art. 724(1)(b), soit demeurer sous garde, soit contracter un engagement pour la somme que d\u00e9termine la Cour (et qui sera sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 $500), soit encore d\u00e9poser aupr\u00e8s de la Cour la somme d\u00e9termin\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019art. 724(1)(b)(iii). La personne condamn\u00e9e doit n\u00e9cessairement ex\u00e9cuter l\u2019une des options, m\u00eame si la personne qui constituait la cour en vertu de l\u2019art. 692(1)(g) n\u2019avait pas la juridiction exig\u00e9e par cet alin\u00e9a. Si la personne ainsi condamn\u00e9e au lieu d\u2019en appeler reste sous garde pendant plus de soixante jours, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai d\u2019appel, elle peut obtenir r\u00e9paration et se faire lib\u00e9rer au moyen de l\u2019habeas corpus. Il ressort donc que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art. 682 dans l\u2019affaire Kennedy, d\u2019apr\u00e8s laquelle ce m\u00eame article a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9venir l\u2019alternative de recours, au choix de la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable, ne tient pas. Si, d\u2019autre part, la personne ainsi condamn\u00e9e paie l\u2019amende et les frais, n\u2019en appelle pas dans les soixante jours, mais s\u2019aper\u00e7oit apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai d\u2019appel que celui qui a prononc\u00e9 la culpabilit\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas juridiction, elle se trouverait, si l\u2019on s\u2019en tient \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019art. 682 donn\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Kennedy, sans aucun recours en droit et elle devrait porter sa condamnation sa vie durant. Il me r\u00e9pugne de penser que le Parlement a voulu que quelqu\u2019un soit dans une position aussi f\u00e2cheuse dans le cas o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9tendue condamnation a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e par une personne agissant de sa propre initiative au sens du mot anglais \u00abvolunteer\u00bb ou par quelqu\u2019un qui n\u2019\u00e9tait plus en fonction au moment de la \u00abcondamnation\u00bb.\nOn pourrait croire que ce sont l\u00e0 des cas rares; pourtant il y a eu des condamnations prononc\u00e9es par des magistrats dont la commission avait pris fin ou avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e. On a \u00e9galement vu des magistrats dont la comp\u00e9tence territoriale \u00e9tait limit\u00e9e et qui ont pr\u00e9tendu condamner des pr\u00e9venus pour une infraction commise hors du territoire o\u00f9 ils avaient juridiction. On trouve facilement d\u2019autres exemples, entre autres des cas o\u00f9 la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le aucune infraction connue en droit. Il ne fait pas de doute qu\u2019une pr\u00e9tendue condamnation qui ne porte sur aucune infraction au sens de la loi est un acte nul: Rex. v. Perron[31], Regina v. Jones[32] et la cause tr\u00e8s r\u00e9cente Regina v. Vallee[33], o\u00f9 la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait lieu \u00e0 certiorari, en d\u00e9pit de l\u2019art. 682, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s que la personne d\u00e9clar\u00e9e coupable en eut appel\u00e9, sans succ\u00e8s, \u00e0 la Cour de comt\u00e9 en vertu de la Partie XXIV du Code du fait qu\u2019il y avait eu \u00abcondamnation\u00bb sur une \u00abinfraction\u00bb inexistante en droit.\nLa cause Crane v. Director of Public Prosecutions[34] est int\u00e9ressante quant \u00e0 la valeur de proc\u00e9dures qui sont nulles bien qu\u2019elles aient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites devant une cour qui avait manifestement comp\u00e9tence en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Dans cette cause, la Chambre des lords a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019un proc\u00e8s tenu devant la cour des Quarter Sessions de Leicester \u00e9tait nul parce que deux prisonniers accus\u00e9s s\u00e9par\u00e9ment avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s ensemble devant un m\u00eame jury. Le fait que les inculp\u00e9s n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en accusation conjointement n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019attention du \u00abrecorder\u00bb, ni \u00e0 celle des avocats comparaissant dans cette cause. Lord Parmoor dit des proc\u00e9dures devant le \u00abrecorder\u00bb:\n[TRADUCTION] \u00ab\u2026Il n\u2019y a eu qu\u2019un pr\u00e9tendu proc\u00e8s qui est nul ab initio\u2026\u00bb et que \u00abdans un proc\u00e8s nul, il ne peut y avoir ni condamnation, ni verdict, ni jugement\u00bb. Cependant, si l\u2019on retient l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation donn\u00e9e dans l\u2019affaire Kennedy, tel que recommand\u00e9 par mon coll\u00e8gue, le Juge Martland, il en d\u00e9coule qu\u2019on pr\u00e9tend que le Parlement a \u00e9dict\u00e9 qu\u2019une proc\u00e9dure nulle aux yeux de la loi, une chose invalide ab initio, devra \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e pour toujours comme une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 valide \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une personne ill\u00e9galement condamn\u00e9e, d\u00e8s que le d\u00e9lai d\u2019appel limit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu dans la Partie XXIV du Code aura expir\u00e9. La cause Crane ne donne pas lieu au certiorari parce que la Cour de premi\u00e8re instance y si\u00e9geait comme Court of Oyer and Terminer pour juger les pr\u00e9venus sur acte d\u2019accusation. Elle ne constituait pas un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur, non plus que dans R. v. Chairman, County of London Quarter Sessions. Les m\u00eames observations s\u2019appliquent aux causes The King v. Justices of the Central Criminal Court[35] et Reg. v. Boaler[36], la Central Criminal Court constituant une cour sup\u00e9rieure dont les proc\u00e9dures et les d\u00e9cisions n\u2019\u00e9taient pas sujettes \u00e0 r\u00e9vision par certiorari. En cons\u00e9quence, le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait pas eu lieu \u00e0 certiorari dans l\u2019affaire Crane, et les autres cit\u00e9es plus haut, n\u2019a aucun rapport avec ce qui nous pr\u00e9occupe ici. Il n\u2019y avait en cause alors aucune disposition similaire \u00e0 celle de l\u2019art. 682.\nLe Parlement, en \u00e9dictant l\u2019art. 682, n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention d\u2019\u00e9tablir ou de donner un moyen de faire d\u00e9clarer non avenues des proc\u00e9dures nulles en elles-m\u00eames. Il entendait plut\u00f4t priver une personne de son droit tr\u00e8s ancien de faire annuler, en recourant au bref de pr\u00e9rogative qu\u2019est le certiorari (un droit qui ne trouve pas son origine au Parlement), ce qui est d\u00e9j\u00e0 nul en droit ou ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait sans comp\u00e9tence ou par abus de comp\u00e9tence. Aussi, si le Parlement veut abolir ce droit, il doit le faire en termes tr\u00e8s explicites, et il est clairement \u00e9dict\u00e9 que l\u2019art. 682 ne doit s\u2019appliquer que lorsque \u00able d\u00e9fendeur a comparu et plaid\u00e9, que l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e au fond\u00bb. L\u2019art. 682 n\u2019\u00e9tablit pas un recours mais entend abolir un droit.\nTout cela m\u2019incline \u00e0 dire que je dois refuser de pr\u00eater une pareille intention au l\u00e9gislateur, en empruntant pour ce faire les mots de lord Kenyon dans la cause Fowler v. Padget[37]:\n[TRADUCTION] J\u2019adopterais n\u2019importe quelle interpr\u00e9tation que les termes de la loi peuvent permettre pour \u00e9viter les cons\u00e9quences monstrueuses qui d\u00e9couleraient n\u00e9cessairement de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019on veut lui donner\u2026\nEn cons\u00e9quence, j\u2019accueillerais l\u2019appel aux fins pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es par le Juge en chef. LE JUGE PIGEON (dissident)\u2014Le 6 mars 1958, l\u2019appelant a fait un aveu de culpabilit\u00e9 sur une inculpation de grossi\u00e8re ind\u00e9cence. Ensuite le 22 avril, vu deux semblables condamnations ant\u00e9rieures, une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e en outre d\u2019une condamnation \u00e0 deux ans de d\u00e9tention pour la derni\u00e8re infraction. Il n\u2019avait pas d\u2019avocat et loin d\u2019interjeter appel il signa comme le permet l\u2019art. 49 de la Loi sur les p\u00e9nitenciers, S.R.C. 1952, c. 206, une renonciation au droit d\u2019appel. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s plus de cinq ans de d\u00e9tention qu\u2019il entreprit les multiples proc\u00e9dures relat\u00e9es par mes coll\u00e8gues. Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi est \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un arr\u00eat confirmant le rejet d\u2019une demande d\u2019habeas corpus avec certiorari auxiliaire.\nJe dois dire tout d\u2019abord qu\u2019\u00e0 mon avis les proc\u00e9dures relatives \u00e0 une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive constituent une instance distincte de l\u2019inculpation \u00e0 la suite de laquelle on les intente, alors qu\u2019au contraire la sentence prononc\u00e9e \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 est partie int\u00e9grante de l\u2019instance introduite par l\u2019inculpation. Ce caract\u00e8re d\u2019instance distincte ressort de l\u2019ensemble des dispositions du Code criminel touchant la sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive (Partie XXI) et sp\u00e9cialement de l\u2019art. 667 sur le droit d\u2019appel en ce cas. La jurisprudence de notre Cour qui, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une telle sentence, admet le pourvoi sur permission sp\u00e9ciale en vertu de l\u2019art. 41 de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame malgr\u00e9 l\u2019exception visant tout jugement \u00abacquittant ou d\u00e9clarant coupable, ou annulant ou confirmant une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 ou un acquittement d\u2019un acte criminel\u00bb, implique n\u00e9cessairement que le jugement pronon\u00e7ant une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive est rendu dans une instance distincte de celle qui donne naissance \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 (Poole c. Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine[38]).\nIl faut maintenant noter que lorsque le Parlement a en 1947 (c. 55, art. 18) \u00e9tabli en premier lieu les dispositions visant la d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive, aucune modification n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9e au Code criminel touchant les recours autres que l\u2019appel. Tandis que pour cette nouvelle sorte d\u2019instances on pr\u00e9voyait explicitement un droit d\u2019appel de la sentence, aucune modification n\u2019\u00e9tait apport\u00e9e au titre des recours extraordinaires (Partie XXII). Le nouveau Code criminel n\u2019a pas modifi\u00e9 la situation sous ce rapport et au titre des recours extraordinaires (Partie XXIII), on ne trouve rien qui vise sp\u00e9cialement ce genre d\u2019instances. En particulier, l\u2019art. 682 se lit comme suit:\n682. Aucune condamnation ou ordonnance ne doit \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9e par certiorari\n(a) lorsqu\u2019un appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 interjet\u00e9, que l\u2019appel ait \u00e9t\u00e9 ou non poursuivi jusqu\u2019\u00e0 sa conclusion; ou\n(b) lorsque le d\u00e9fendeur a comparu et plaid\u00e9, que l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e au fond, et qu\u2019un appel aurait pu \u00eatre interjet\u00e9, mais que le d\u00e9fendeur ne l\u2019a pas interjet\u00e9.\nComment doit-on appliquer l\u2019alin\u00e9a (b) de ce texte \u00e0 une sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive alors que la proc\u00e9dure sur la demande d\u2019une telle sentence ne pr\u00e9voit pas que l\u2019inculp\u00e9 soit appel\u00e9 \u00e0 plaider? Faut-il dire que puisqu\u2019il est seulement appel\u00e9 \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, il suffit qu\u2019il ait comparu et n\u2019ait pas interjet\u00e9 appel pour \u00eatre priv\u00e9 du recours par voie de certiorari? En mati\u00e8re p\u00e9nale, cela ne semble pas possible. La privation d\u2019un droit ne peut r\u00e9sulter que d\u2019un texte formel. Si celui que l\u2019on trouve dans le code ne s\u2019applique pas exactement parce que l\u2019une des conditions ne peut pas \u00eatre remplie, il faut d\u00e9cider comme on l\u2019a fait pour l\u2019art. 41 de la Loi sur la Cour supr\u00eame: la disposition privative ne s\u2019appliquant pas exactement \u00e0 la sentence de d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive, on ne peut l\u2019y appliquer par analogie ou par extension. Une interpr\u00e9tation extensive d\u2019une clause privative comme l\u2019art. 682 du Code criminel serait une d\u00e9cision sans pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent en jurisprudence britannique.\nLes dispositions sp\u00e9ciales \u00e9tablies pour le droit d\u2019appel d\u00e9montrent qu\u2019en introduisant dans notre droit p\u00e9nal l\u2019instance en condamnation \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention pr\u00e9ventive, le Parlement a vu la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9voir explicitement le droit d\u2019appel mutatis mutandis, les dispositions ordinaires touchant les instances par inculpation d\u2019acte criminel n\u2019\u00e9tant pas textuellement applicables \u00e0 ce nouveau genre d\u2019instances. Tant qu\u2019il n\u2019arr\u00eatera pas des dispositions analogues au sujet des recours extraordinaires, nous ne pourrons faire autrement que les appliquer comme elles se lisent. Pour ce motif, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelant est dans la m\u00eame situation que dans Smith c. Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine[39], il n\u2019a pas plaid\u00e9.\nAyant conclu que l\u2019appelant a droit au certiorari, je dois dire ensuite qu\u2019\u00e0 mon avis le dossier d\u00e9montre que, devant le magistrat Hunter on n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019un avis de sept jours francs lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 comme l\u2019exige imp\u00e9rativement l\u2019art. 662 du Code criminel. Le dossier fait voir qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019audition devant le magistrat, au lieu de faire la preuve de l\u2019avis par le t\u00e9moignage du constable qui l\u2019a signifi\u00e9, on y a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 au moyen d\u2019une d\u00e9claration faite volontairement devant le tribunal par l\u2019accus\u00e9. Le texte fourni par le st\u00e9nographe officiel est comme suit:\n[TRADUCTION] LE SUBSTITUT: Votre Honneur, vous vous souviendrez qu\u2019en cette affaire \u00e0 l\u2019audition pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente j\u2019ai fait une demande en vertu du paragraphe 1 de l\u2019article 661 du Code criminel, un avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 et il est dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019admettre pour \u00e9viter la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019en faire la preuve.\nLE MAGISTRAT: Alors, M. Sanders, on vous a signifi\u00e9 une copie de cet avis?\nM. SANDERS: C\u2019est exact.\nLE MAGISTRAT: Et, au bas, c\u2019est votre signature par laquelle vous l\u2019admettez?\nM. SANDERS: Oui.\nLE MAGISTRAT: C\u2019est une copie de ce que j\u2019ai en main ici pr\u00e9sentement?\nM. SANDERS: Oui, c\u2019est exact.\nPI\u00c9CE N\u00b0 1, AVIS.\nLa pi\u00e8ce a malheureusement \u00e9t\u00e9 perdue; il n\u2019y a au dossier que la copie qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 et que ce dernier a produite r\u00e9cemment avec une de ses d\u00e9clarations sous serment. On remarquera que la d\u00e9claration faite par l\u2019appelant porte seulement sur la signification de l\u2019avis. On n\u2019y trouve pas la moindre allusion \u00e0 la date de cette signification, ni \u00e0 l\u2019intervalle prescrit entre le jour de la signification et celui de l\u2019audition. En mati\u00e8re civile, cette d\u00e9claration serait sans doute suffisante vu la r\u00e8gle que les parties sont li\u00e9es par la fa\u00e7on dont les proc\u00e9dures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 conduites. A mon avis, en mati\u00e8re criminelle, il ne saurait en \u00eatre ainsi en face d\u2019une exigence imp\u00e9rieuse de la loi et sp\u00e9cialement lorsque l\u2019accus\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat. Le principe \u00e0 suivre est celui que l\u2019on applique quand il n\u2019y a pas eu objection \u00e0 une preuve ill\u00e9gale; en mati\u00e8re p\u00e9nale, cette omission ne couvre pas n\u00e9cessairement l\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9.\nD\u2019ailleurs on peut se demander si l\u2019appelant pouvait valablement admettre avoir re\u00e7u l\u2019avis prescrit par l\u2019art. 662. En effet, le dernier paragraphe se lit comme suit:\n(3) Aux fins de l\u2019article 660, lorsque l\u2019accus\u00e9 admet les all\u00e9gations contenues dans l\u2019avis mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a (b) du paragraphe (1), il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de prouver ces all\u00e9gations.\n(M\u00eame si la correction n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite que l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante (1959, ch. 71, a. 30), il faut \u00e9videmment lire l\u2019alin\u00e9a (a) et non l\u2019alin\u00e9a (b) puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agit des fins de l\u2019article 660.)\nSi l\u2019on a pris la peine de dire qu\u2019\u00abaux fins de l\u2019article 660\u00bb (repris de justice), il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de faire la preuve des all\u00e9gations contenues dans l\u2019avis si l\u2019accus\u00e9 les admet, cela implique certainement qu\u2019il est toujours n\u00e9cessaire de prouver les faits requis pour les fins de l\u2019art. 661 (psychopathie sexuelle criminelle), autrement la disposition serait totalement inutile. Or ici, c\u2019est bien de l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 661 qu\u2019il s\u2019agit: il est donc clair que l\u2019accus\u00e9 ne pouvait pas en les admettant dispenser de la preuve des faits. Sans exprimer d\u2019opinion ferme sur ce point, je vois mal comment on peut sou- tenir que cette r\u00e8gle ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 la preuve d\u2019un fait aussi essentiel \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de cette proc\u00e9dure que la signification d\u2019un avis de sept jours francs, sans laquelle le l\u00e9gislateur d\u00e9fend express\u00e9ment de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019audition.\nIl faut maintenant observer que rien ne fait voir que sur le document perdu il y avait une date de signification d\u00e9montrant que le d\u00e9lai prescrit avait \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9. On n\u2019en trouve aucune sur la copie produite par l\u2019appelant. Il est vrai que lui-m\u00eame ne nous renseigne pas sur ce point mais juridiquement on ne peut pas le lui reprocher. Il n\u2019a pas \u00e0 contredire une preuve que l\u2019on ne trouve pas au dossier. Il lui suffit d\u2019en signaler l\u2019absence.\nJe ne crois pas que l\u2019on puisse pr\u00e9sumer que la pi\u00e8ce perdue d\u00e9montrait que le d\u00e9lai de sept jours avait \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9. La condamnation ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9e par un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur, l\u2019accomplissement des formalit\u00e9s prescrites ne se pr\u00e9sume pas. Comme la pi\u00e8ce a \u00e9t\u00e9 perdue, on aurait sans doute pu prouver par des d\u00e9clarations sous serment que cette mention s\u2019y trouvait. On ne l\u2019a pas fait.\nDans sa d\u00e9claration sous serment, le magistrat se contente d\u2019affirmer qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019audition on a prouv\u00e9 \u00e0 sa satisfaction que l\u2019appelant avait re\u00e7u un avis de sept jours francs. En disant cela il ne fait que r\u00e9it\u00e9rer sa conclusion sur ce point-l\u00e0. Or, c\u2019est un principe incontestable qu\u2019un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur ne peut pas se donner juridiction en concluant sans preuve suffisante \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un fait dont sa juridiction d\u00e9pend. Comme nous l\u2019avons vu, la d\u00e9claration faite \u00e0 l\u2019audience par l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait incompl\u00e8te et ne d\u00e9montrait pas qu\u2019une exigence essentielle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie, savoir le d\u00e9lai de sept jours francs. En l\u2019absence de toute autre preuve que ce fait-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 autrement, la seule conclusion juridiquement possible c\u2019est que le magistrat s\u2019est m\u00e9pris sur la port\u00e9e de la d\u00e9claration faite \u00e0 l\u2019audience par l\u2019appelant. Il a sans doute cru que l\u2019appelant avait admis implicitement que le d\u00e9lai prescrit avait \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9 alors que le texte ne justifie pas une telle conclusion. Pour ce qui est de la d\u00e9claration du substitut, il suffit de dire qu\u2019elle n\u2019ajoute rien \u00e0 celle du magistrat.\nIl reste celle du constable. Lui non plus ne dit aucunement que sur la pi\u00e8ce perdue la date de la signification \u00e9tait inscrite et que cette date \u00e9tait d\u2019au moins sept jours francs ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle de l\u2019audition. Tout ce qu\u2019il affirme c\u2019est qu\u2019il croit avoir respect\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai parce qu\u2019il se rappelle avoir v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 les exigences du Code. D\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, il d\u00e9clare avoir fait la signification \u00e0 Cloverdale. Or, apr\u00e8s la date du 31 mars qui est celle de l\u2019avis d\u2019apr\u00e8s la copie vers\u00e9e au dossier et dont l\u2019authenticit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9e, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Cloverdale que le 15 avril et le 22 avril, jour de l\u2019audition. Il est donc impossible que le d\u00e9lai ait \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9 en signifiant \u00e0 l\u2019endroit indiqu\u00e9 par le constable.\nLa d\u00e9claration sous serment de l\u2019appelant quant aux dates o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Cloverdale n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9e. De plus, comme il \u00e9tait prisonnier, le minist\u00e8re public devait \u00eatre en mesure d\u2019en v\u00e9rifier l\u2019exactitude et puisqu\u2019il n\u2019a pas apport\u00e9 de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cette affirmation, ce fait doit \u00eatre aujourd\u2019hui tenu pour prouv\u00e9. La conclusion c\u2019est que le constable a d\u00fb faire erreur quant au d\u00e9lai et que l\u2019avis n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 de sept jours francs. M\u00eame s\u2019il a soigneusement lu l\u2019art. 662 il n\u2019a pas n\u00e9cessairement bien compris ce que signifie \u00absept jours francs\u00bb ni correctement fait le calcul et il ne l\u2019affirme pas. Puisqu\u2019il a signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 Cloverdale, ce doit \u00eatre le 15 avril.\nEn d\u00e9finitive, \u00e0 mon avis, il faut dire que la d\u00e9claration sous serment du constable ne suppl\u00e9e pas \u00e0 l\u2019insuffisance du dossier et ne d\u00e9montre pas que le d\u00e9lai prescrit ait \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9. Il est s\u00fbr que c\u2019est une omission \u00e0 laquelle on aurait pu facilement rem\u00e9dier si l\u2019accus\u00e9 l\u2019avait signal\u00e9e au lieu d\u2019admettre sans protester ce qu\u2019on lui demandait d\u2019admettre. En mati\u00e8re civile, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, cela constituerait s\u00fbrement une fin de non recevoir mais, \u00e0 mon avis, il ne saurait en \u00eatre ainsi en droit criminel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une exigence imp\u00e9rative de la loi surtout \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un inculp\u00e9 qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas assist\u00e9 d\u2019un avocat.\nEn \u00e9tant venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le magistrat a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 sans preuve compl\u00e8te d\u2019un avis signifi\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux exigences de la loi, il me faut maintenant, vu les dispositions du par. 1 de l\u2019art. 683 du Code criminel, rechercher si le d\u00e9faut dont il s\u2019agit a eu pour effet de priver le magistrat de sa juridiction. Le texte qui prescrit l\u2019avis est on ne peut plus explicite:\nUne demande selon le paragraphe (1) de l\u2019article 661 ne peut pas \u00eatre entendue a moins que le poursuivant n\u2019en ait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9 un avis de sept jours francs\u2026\nJ\u2019ai soulign\u00e9 les mots \u00abne peut pas \u00eatre entendue\u00bb parce qu\u2019ils me semblent impliquer n\u00e9cessairement que le magistrat n\u2019a pas le pouvoir d\u2019entendre la demande \u00e0 moins que l\u2019avis ait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9ellement donn\u00e9. Le texte ne dit pas qu\u2019il faut prouver \u00e0 la satisfaction du magistrat que l\u2019avis a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9. Il d\u00e9fend de proc\u00e9der en l\u2019absence d\u2019avis. Il me para\u00eet impossible de voir dans le texte une disposition dont le Parlement a voulu que le magistrat soit juge. Il semble bien au contraire avoir voulu clairement en faire une condition de l\u2019exercice valable de la juridiction.\nDans L\u2019Alliance des Professeurs catholiques de Montr\u00e9al c. La Commission des Relations ouvri\u00e8res[40], cette Cour a statu\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait agi sans juridiction en pronon\u00e7ant sans avis \u00e0 l\u2019appelante l\u2019annulation d\u2019un certificat. Dans Regina v. County of London Quarter Sessions Appeals Committee, Ex parte Rossi[41], la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Angleterre, sur une demande de certiorari, a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 un tribunal inf\u00e9rieur comme ayant agi sans juridiction pour avoir erron\u00e9ment trait\u00e9 comme suffisant un avis donn\u00e9 par une lettre recommand\u00e9e qui n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9. Enfin, dans Dennis c. La Reine[42], les motifs de la majorit\u00e9 expriment formellement l\u2019avis qu\u2019un juge de la Cour de comt\u00e9, saisi d\u2019un appel d\u2019une d\u00e9claration sommaire de culpabilit\u00e9, avait \u00e0 bon droit d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas juridiction parce que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas signifi\u00e9 l\u2019avis d\u2019appel \u00e0 la personne prescrite par l\u2019art. 722 du Code criminel. Je note au surplus que tous les juges qui ont rendu l\u2019arr\u00eat en Cour d\u2019appel dans la pr\u00e9sente cause ont exprim\u00e9 l\u2019opinion que si l\u2019avis prescrit n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9ellement \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 d\u2019une fa\u00e7on conforme aux exigences du Code, le magistrat agissait sans juridiction. C\u2019est la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle il faut en venir. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un fait sur lequel devait porter son enqu\u00eate et o\u00f9 le mal-jug\u00e9 ne peut constituer un vice de comp\u00e9tence. Il s\u2019agit au contraire d\u2019une condition pr\u00e9alable de l\u2019exercice valable de la juridiction. Il faut que cette condition soit remplie pour qu\u2019il puisse agir validement.\nPour les motifs ci-dessus, je suis d\u2019accord avec les conclusions du juge en chef, y compris celle qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019ordre pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019art. 689 du Code criminel pour la protection du magistrat et des agents de la paix.\nAppel rejet\u00e9, LE JUGE EN CHEF CARTWRIGHT et LES JUGES HALL, SPENCE et PIGEON \u00e9tant dissidents.\nProcureur de l\u2019appelant: C.R.

Le b\u00e2timent \u00e9tait muni de gicleurs automatiques. Par contrat avec la propri\u00e9taire, la d\u00e9fenderesse s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e \u00e0 fournir un service de surveillance de ces gicleurs et S avait pris \u00e0 sa charge le co\u00fbt de ce service. Avant la fermeture de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement pour deux semaines de vacances, un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 du service des incendies a demand\u00e9 au g\u00e9rant local de la d\u00e9fenderesse qu\u2019on apporte une attention particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 tout appel venant de ces lieux. Dans la nuit qui suit, un incendie se d\u00e9clare et un gicleur se d\u00e9clenche et l\u2019\u00e9teint. Mais il s\u2019\u00e9coule une heure avant que les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de la d\u00e9fenderesse alertent les pompiers auxquels seuls il appartient d\u2019arr\u00eater l\u2019\u00e9coulement de l\u2019eau. Les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9venus qu\u2019il y avait lieu d\u2019apporter une attention sp\u00e9ciale aux b\u00e2timents et sont venus d\u2019abord \u00e0 l\u2019immeuble voisin dont un signal avait \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u en m\u00eame temps. En vertu de leurs contrats avec S, les demanderesses sont tenues de l\u2019indemniser des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts. Elles obtiennent la subrogation et intentent une poursuite conjointe contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Celle-ci plaide absence de faute et de lien de droit. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a statu\u00e9 que la d\u00e9fenderesse avait commis une faute en ne prenant pas imm\u00e9diatement sur r\u00e9ception des signaux les dispositions n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 une v\u00e9rification imm\u00e9diate de la situation et en ne pr\u00e9venant pas sans d\u00e9lai le service des incendies. Il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que cette faute engageait la responsabilit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9fenderesse envers S malgr\u00e9 l\u2019absence de lien contractuel. La Cour d\u2019appel a infirm\u00e9 ce jugement. Les demanderesses en ont appel\u00e9 \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9. La Cour d\u2019appel a raison de dire que la d\u00e9fenderesse n\u2019avait pas par la loi l\u2019obligation de faire ce qu\u2019on lui reproche d\u2019avoir omis, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire pr\u00e9venir avec diligence les pompiers d\u00e8s la r\u00e9ception des signaux. La d\u00e9fenderesse n\u2019est pas un service public charg\u00e9 de surveiller g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement tout un secteur, elle est une entreprise priv\u00e9e qui ne contracte l\u2019obligation de surveillance par le truchement d\u2019une installation \u00e9lectrique qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de celui qui s\u2019abonne \u00e0 son service. Il est vrai que l\u2019existence de relations contractuelles n\u2019exclut aucunement la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une obligation d\u00e9lictuelle ou quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle d\u00e9coulant du m\u00eame fait. Cependant, le premier des \u00e9l\u00e9ments requis pour donner naissance \u00e0 une telle responsabilit\u00e9 est \u00e9videmment une faute.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, province de Qu\u00e9bec[1], infirmant un jugement du Juge Brossard.

Pour la protection contre les risques d\u2019incendie, le b\u00e2timent \u00e9tait muni de gicleurs automatiques. Par contrat avec la propri\u00e9taire, l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e \u00e0 fournir un service de surveillance de ces gicleurs et par son bail Sportland Shoe avait pris \u00e0 sa charge le co\u00fbt de ce service. Celle-ci avait, en outre, conclu directement avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e un autre contrat en vertu duquel cette derni\u00e8re fournissait un service d\u2019alarme pour le cas d\u2019effraction.\nLe vendredi 5 juillet 1957, apr\u00e8s midi, un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 du service des incendies de la ville de Montr\u00e9al, inform\u00e9 de la fermeture imminente de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement pour deux semaines de vacances, se rend sur les lieux avec un enqu\u00eateur d\u2019une association d\u2019assureurs et, avec un repr\u00e9sentant de Sportland Shoe, fait la visite de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement. Cette pr\u00e9caution est motiv\u00e9e par le fait que l\u2019ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, \u00e0 la m\u00eame \u00e9poque, un incendie d\u2019origine criminelle s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 et avait caus\u00e9 des dommages consid\u00e9rables. La visite termin\u00e9e, le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 du service des incendies fait un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique au g\u00e9rant local de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, lui rappelle les \u00e9v\u00e9nements de l\u2019ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente et demande qu\u2019on apporte une attention particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 tout appel venant de ces lieux. Dans la nuit qui suit, un incendie se d\u00e9clare, un gicleur se d\u00e9clenche et l\u2019\u00e9teint mais il s\u2019\u00e9coule une heure avant que les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e alertent les prompiers auxquels seuls il appartient d\u2019arr\u00eater l\u2019\u00e9coulement de l\u2019eau. Ayant re\u00e7u simultan\u00e9ment des signaux venant du b\u00e2timent occup\u00e9 par Sportland Shoe et d\u2019un immeuble voisin, le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait cru qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait seulement d\u2019une hausse subite de pression et non d\u2019un d\u00e9clenchement de gicleur. Au lieu d\u2019alerter imm\u00e9diatement les pompiers, il attend d\u2019avoir des hommes disponibles. Ces derniers ne sont pas pr\u00e9venus qu\u2019il y a lieu de porter une attention speciale \u00e0 la Sportland Shoe. Ils s\u2019en vont donc d\u2019abord \u00e0 l\u2019immeuble voisin et n\u2019y trouvent rien d\u2019anormal. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019ensuite, pr\u00e8s d\u2019une heure apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9ception des signaux, qu\u2019ils constatent enfin ce qui s\u2019est produit et pr\u00e9viennent les pompiers.\nEn vertu de leurs contrats avec Sportland Shoe les appelantes sont tenues de l\u2019indemniser des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts qui s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8vent \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de $50,000; Elles obtiennent la subrogation et intentent une poursuite conjointe contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Celle-ci plaide absence de faute et de lien de droit.\nEn Cour sup\u00e9rieure, le juge Brossard a statu\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait commis une faute en ne prenant pas imm\u00e9diatement sur r\u00e9ception des signaux les dispositions n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 une v\u00e9rification imm\u00e9diate de la situation et, faute de ne pouvoir les prendre imm\u00e9diatement, en ne pr\u00e9venant pas sans d\u00e9lai le service des incendies. Il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que cette faute engageait la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e envers Sportland Shoe malgr\u00e9 l\u2019absence de lien contractuel et il a estim\u00e9 les dommages en d\u00e9coulant \u00e0 la moiti\u00e9 du pr\u00e9judice total, soit \u00e0 $22,484.70.\nLa Cour d\u2019appel[2] a infirm\u00e9 ce jugement. Les motifs essentiels de l\u2019arr\u00eat prononc\u00e9 par le juge en chef de la Province et sur lesquels ses quatre coll\u00e8gues ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019accord sont comme suit:\nIl me para\u00eet clair que le premier juge a raison d\u2019\u00e9carter le contrat pass\u00e9 entre Dominion Electric et madame Fischler. Sportland n\u2019est pas partie \u00e0 ce contrat et ni elle ni ses cessionnaires ne peuvent l\u2019invoquer.\nIl me para\u00eet clair aussi que l\u2019omission peut constituer une faute, mais seulement lorsqu\u2019il y a obligation d\u2019agir, \u00abde faire, soit des actes prescrits par la loi, soit des actes que les rapports n\u00e9cessaires des hommes doivent faire consid\u00e9rer comme obligatoires\u00bb (Carpentier et du Saint, R\u00e9pertoire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, tome XXXII, vis Responsabilit\u00e9 civile, n\u00b0 343, p. 883).\nDans le cas pr\u00e9sent, le retard est d\u00fb d\u2019abord \u00e0 une mauvaise interpr\u00e9tation du signal re\u00e7u et ensuite au fait que les employ\u00e9s de Dominion Electric ont v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 d\u2019abord l\u2019immeuble voisin de celui de Sportland Shoe. Dominion Electric avait-elle envers Sportland Shoe l\u2019obligation civile d\u2019alerter les pompiers d\u00e8s la r\u00e9ception du signal et de v\u00e9rifier d\u2019abord l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de Sportland Shoe? Il me semble que cette obligation ne lui est impos\u00e9e ni par la loi, ni par \u00ables rapports n\u00e9cessaires des hommes\u00bb. Il me semble qu\u2019un citoyen qui a connaissance, par un moyen quelconque, qu\u2019un syst\u00e8me de gicleurs automatiques se d\u00e9clenche dans deux immeubles n\u2019est pas civilement tenu d\u2019alerter les pompiers et d\u2019aller v\u00e9rifier un immeuble plut\u00f4t que l\u2019autre. Si Dominion Electric avait cette obligation civile, ce ne peut \u00eatre qu\u2019en vertu de l\u2019engagement contract\u00e9 par son directeur Neely lors de sa conversation avec le capitaine Rowe le 5 juillet 1957. Mais alors, nous sommes sortis du domaine d\u00e9lictuel ou quasi-d\u00e9lictuel. C\u2019est une obligation que Dominion Electric aurait assum\u00e9e par son directeur. Or, le premier juge prononce que cette conversation ne constitue pas un contrat. Je crois qu\u2019il a raison. Aux motifs qu\u2019il donne j\u2019ajouterai celui que la preuve d\u00e9montre sans contradiction que Neely n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de lier Dominion Electric par contrat.\nJe conclus que Dominion Electric n\u2019a commis aucune faute envers Sportland Shoe parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait aucune obligation d\u2019accomplir l\u2019acte qu\u2019on lui reproche d\u2019avoir omis.\nLes faits de la pr\u00e9sente cause se rapprochent de ceux qui donn\u00e8rent lieu \u00e0 notre arr\u00eat Banque de Montr\u00e9al v. Boston Insurance Company (1963, B.R. 487) confirm\u00e9 par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada (1964, R.C.S. v). Je dois dire d\u2019abord qu\u2019il ne me para\u00eet pas tout \u00e0 fait certain que Sportland Shoe et ses cessionnaires ne peuvent pas invoquer le contrat entre Madame Fischler et l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire cependant de rechercher si vraiment Sportland Shoe a pris la charge du contrat sans ce b\u00e9n\u00e9fice car, m\u00eame si elle pouvait s\u2019en pr\u00e9valoir, la clause suivante ferait obstacle \u00e0 la r\u00e9clamation:\n[TRADUCTION] 5. Il est convenu entre les parties que Dominion Company n\u2019est pas un assureur, que le tarif ci-apr\u00e8s stipul\u00e9 est \u00e9tabli uniquement d\u2019apr\u00e8s la valeur probable du service pour le bon fonctionnement de l\u2019installation d\u00e9crite et qu\u2019advenant l\u2019omission de fournir le service et une perte en r\u00e9sultant, la responsabilit\u00e9 sera limit\u00e9e \u00e0 la somme de cinquante dollars ($50), montant auquel elle est fix\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de dommages liquid\u00e9s.\nJe ne vois pas comment sur une poursuite fond\u00e9e sur le contrat nous pourrions ne pas donner effet \u00e0 cette stipulation d\u2019un montant nominal de dommages tout comme il faut en principe donner effet \u00e0 une stipulation de non-responsabilit\u00e9: Glengoil Steamship Co. c. Pilkington[3]. Il n\u2019est pas question qu\u2019il y ait ici faute lourde comme dans l\u2019affaire Canada Steamship Lines Ltd. v. The King[4]. Il est \u00e9galement clair que la conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 une convention distincte affranchie des conditions du contrat avec Madame Fischler.\nIl faut donc, par cons\u00e9quent, rechercher uniquement si la Cour d\u2019appel a \u00e0 bon droit \u00e9cart\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle sur laquelle le juge de premi\u00e8re instance avait bas\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision. Dans son jugement, ce dernier dit:\nPar rapport \u00e0 Madame Fischler, d\u2019une part, et \u00e0 la Sportland Shoe, d\u2019autre part, la d\u00e9fenderesse et ses pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e9taient dans une situation identique \u00e0 celle d\u2019un conducteur d\u2019automobile par rapport, d\u2019une part, \u00e0 son employeur envers lequel il a des obligations contractuelles et, d\u2019autre part, envers les tiers, automobilistes ou pi\u00e9tons, envers lesquels il a une obligation de prudence.\nAvec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour le savant juge, il me faut dire que la comparaison est inexacte. L\u2019obligation du conducteur d\u2019automobile envers les tiers, ou plus exactement le devoir de pru- dence qui lui incombe, est \u00e9tablie de fa\u00e7on incontestable par la loi. Ici, au contraire, il me para\u00eet que la Cour d\u2019Appel a raison de dire que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas par la loi l\u2019obligation de faire ce qu\u2019on lui reproche d\u2019avoir omis, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire pr\u00e9venir avec diligence les pompiers d\u00e8s la r\u00e9ception de signaux provenant de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de Sportland Shoe. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019est pas un service public charg\u00e9 de surveiller g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement tout un secteur, elle est une entreprise priv\u00e9e qui ne contracte l\u2019obligation de surveillance d\u2019un \u00e9tablissement par le truchement d\u2019une installation \u00e9lectrique qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de celui qui s\u2019abonne \u00e0 son service. Le devoir qu\u2019on lui reproche d\u2019avoir omis de remplir et en raison duquel on pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019elle a commis une faute g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice de responsabilit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas de ceux qui incombent \u00e0 tous, c\u2019est au contraire uniquement une obligation contractuelle dont elle est charg\u00e9e.\nIl est vrai que l\u2019existence de relations contractuelles n\u2019exclut aucunement la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une obligation d\u00e9lictuelle ou quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle d\u00e9coulant du m\u00eame fait. Encore faut-il pour que cela soit possible que se rencontrent tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments requis pour donner naissance \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re responsabilit\u00e9. Le premier de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments est \u00e9videmment une faute. Pour qu\u2019il y ait faute, il est essentiel comme cela d\u00e9coule du texte de l\u2019art. 1053 C.C., qu\u2019il y ait soit un fait positif dommageable et non justifiable, soit l\u2019omission d\u2019accomplir un devoir envers la partie l\u00e9s\u00e9e.\nA l\u2019audition, comme dans un factum prolixe, on nous a cit\u00e9 beaucoup de jurisprudence et de doctrine pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019un devoir dont la violation constitue une faute peut fort bien exister sans qu\u2019un texte formel en proclame l\u2019existence. Cela n\u2019est pas douteux mais ne signifie aucunement qu\u2019il y a lieu de consid\u00e9rer comme un tel devoir une obligation qui ne d\u00e9coule pas de la loi mais uniquement d\u2019un contrat avec un tiers.\nComme la Cour d\u2019appel l\u2019a fait \u00e0 bon droit observer, cette derni\u00e8re conception de la responsabilit\u00e9 civile signifierait qu\u2019envers les tiers qui ne sont pas parties au contrat, celui-ci pourrait imposer des obligations plus lourdes que celles qui en d\u00e9coulent en faveur du contractant. Il en serait ainsi chaque fois qu\u2019on y trouve une exclusion ou une limitation de responsabilit\u00e9. On nous a cit\u00e9 de nombreux arr\u00eats touchant la responsabilit\u00e9 du manufacturier d\u2019une chose dangereuse envers des personnes qui n\u2019ont pas contract\u00e9 avec lui. En pareil cas, la source de la responsabilit\u00e9 est le manquement au devoir que l\u2019on reconna\u00eet au manufacturier de ne pas mettre de telles choses sur le march\u00e9 et ce devoir est ind\u00e9pendant de son obligation contractuelle de vendeur: Ross c. Dunstall[5]. Il en va de m\u00eame pour le propri\u00e9taire d\u2019un immeuble lou\u00e9 envers les personnes que le locataire y re\u00e7oit. La responsabilit\u00e9 du dommage d\u00e9coulant d\u2019un \u00e9tat d\u00e9fectueux lui incombe comme propri\u00e9taire de la chose et elle existe ind\u00e9pendamment de ses obligations contractuelles de bailleur. On pourrait multiplier les exemples et dans tous les cas o\u00f9 la responsabilit\u00e9 quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue l\u2019on constaterait que le fondement en est l\u2019existence d\u2019un devoir autre que celui qui d\u00e9coule uniquement d\u2019une obligation contractuelle.\nL\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens. Ce rejet est prononc\u00e9 sur le fond car, au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audition la permission d\u2019appeler a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e sans frais aux appelantes; leur pourvoi de plein droit \u00e9tait irrecevable vu que le montant en litige doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 s\u00e9par\u00e9ment pour chacune mais l\u2019intim\u00e9e de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 avait omis d\u2019en demander le rejet pour ce motif.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs des demanderesses, appelantes: Tansey, de Grandpr\u00e9, Bergeron, Monet, Lavery & O\u2019Donnell, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs de la d\u00e9fenderesse, intim\u00e9e: Monette, Filion, Clerk, Michaud, Barakett & L\u00e9vesque, Montr\u00e9al.\n[1] [1967] B.R. 767.\n[2] [1967] B.R. 767.\n[3] (1897), 28 R.C.S. 146.\n[4] [1952] A.C. 192, 1 All E.R. 305, 2 D.L.R. 786, 5 W.W.R.

Le tr\u00e9sorier de la province s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 louer aux demandeurs trois de ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s pendant cinq ans, moyennant un loyer \u00e9gal \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de 6 pour-cent l\u2019an sur la valeur des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e9tablie aux actes de transport plus les taxes annuelles. Les demandeurs avaient le privil\u00e8ge de faire des paiements sup\u00e9rieurs au loyer ainsi d\u00e9termin\u00e9 pour racheter ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s aux prix \u00e9tablis par les diff\u00e9rents actes de transport.\nLes demandeurs ont all\u00e9gu\u00e9 l\u2019inex\u00e9cution de la convention sous plusieurs rapports et, en cons\u00e9quence, en ont demand\u00e9 la r\u00e9solution et r\u00e9clam\u00e9 la r\u00e9trocession des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s et le remboursement des sommes qu\u2019ils avaient vers\u00e9es \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse en vertu de cette convention. Par demande reconventionnelle, la d\u00e9fenderesse a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 des demandeurs OG et IG en paiement des sommes dues en vertu des baux relatifs aux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s vis\u00e9es par la convention et de Green\u2019s Garage et de B Ltd. le paiement d\u2019un billet \u00e0 ordre souscrit par le premier de m\u00eame que le remboursement de leur d\u00e9couvert de compte.\nLes demandeurs ont pr\u00e9tendu, dans leur d\u00e9fense, \u00e0 la demande reconventionnelle, que tous les actes et conventions de la d\u00e9fenderesse vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019action \u00e9taient nuls parce que faits en vertu de la loi dite The Treasury Branches Act, S.R.A. 1955, c. 344, et que cette Loi \u00e9tait ultra vires des pouvoirs de la L\u00e9gislature d\u2019Alberta.\nLa Cour d\u2019appel a confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9 la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance que les pr\u00e9tentions des demandeurs ne justifiaient pas un recours en dommages ou en r\u00e9solution. Quant \u00e0 la demande reconventionnelle, la majorit\u00e9 des juges de la Cour d\u2019appel ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis que les demandeurs en tant qu\u2019emprunteurs, n\u2019avaient pas le droit d\u2019invoquer l\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 de la Loi comme moyen de d\u00e9fense. En cons\u00e9quence, ils n\u2019ont pas cru n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019adjuger sur cette question. Tous les juges de la Cour d\u2019appel, \u00e0 l\u2019exception d\u2019un, ont opin\u00e9 que les transports de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s faits en ex\u00e9cution de la convention constituaient un paiement partiel de la dette des demandeurs, sauf que ceux des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qu\u2019on leur avait lou\u00e9es n\u2019avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s qu\u2019en garantie et non en paiement partiel. En cons\u00e9quence, la Cour d\u2019appel a modifi\u00e9 le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance qui rejetait l\u2019action des demandeurs et accueillait la demande reconventionnelle de la d\u00e9fenderesse en biffant du jugement la disposition qui autorisait la d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 prendre possession de ces trois propri\u00e9t\u00e9s. Les demandeurs en appel\u00e8rent \u00e0 cette Cour et la d\u00e9fenderesse a produit un contre-appel.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel et le contre-appel doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s, les Juges Hall et Spence \u00e9tant en partie dissidents.\nLe Juge en Chef Cartwright et les Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie et Pigeon: M\u00eame si la pr\u00e9tention \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e que la loi The Treasury Branches Act \u00e9tait inconstitutionnelle, parce qu\u2019elle se rapporte au commerce de banque, qui est de la comp\u00e9tence exclusive du Parlement du Canada, et que le tr\u00e9sorier de la province n\u2019avait pas, en droit, le pouvoir de pr\u00eater aux demandeurs les sommes que de fait il leur a avanc\u00e9es, la jurisprudence d\u00e9montre clairement que, comme la transaction n\u2019avait rien d\u2019ill\u00e9gal et que tout au plus le tr\u00e9sorier de la province n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de faire cr\u00e9dit, les demandeurs n\u2019avaient pas de d\u00e9fense \u00e0 opposer \u00e0 l\u2019action en recouvrement des sommes en tant qu\u2019argent re\u00e7u. Ind\u00e9pendamment de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la Loi, les demandeurs sont l\u00e9galement tenus de rembourser les sommes que la d\u00e9fenderesse leur a vers\u00e9es. Les demandeurs ne peuvent pas r\u00e9clamer les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qu\u2019ils ont c\u00e9d\u00e9es en paiement ou en garantie de paiement des sommes qu\u2019ils devaient l\u00e9galement \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse.\nL\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas une d\u00e9fense \u00e0 la demande reconventionnelle de la d\u00e9fenderesse et, dans les circonstances, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider si la Loi est ultra vires des pouvoirs de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative d\u2019Alberta.\nDe plus, les transports des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 lou\u00e9es aux demandeurs \u00e9taient des transports en garantie de la dette des demandeurs.\nLes Juges Hall et Spence, en partie dissidents: II faut conclure (i) que The Treasury Branches Act est ultra vires; (ii) que le fait d\u2019exploiter les treasury branch ne constitue pas un acte d\u2019exercice de la pr\u00e9rogative royale; (iii) Qu\u2019ind\u00e9pendamment de l\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 de la Loi, la demanderesse a droit de recouvrer les sommes qu\u2019elle a pr\u00eat\u00e9es aux demandeurs.\nAyant trouv\u00e9 que The Treasury Branches Act est ultra vires, il s\u2019ensuit que la convention entre les demandeurs et le tr\u00e9sorier de la province n\u2019existe pas en droit. Cela n\u2019annule pas pour autant les actes r\u00e9ellement accomplis par les demandeurs, savoir les cessions pures et simples de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse. Toutefois, la convention \u00e9tant nulle, les demandeurs n\u2019ont pas de droit d\u2019action ni en r\u00e9solution ni en dommages.\nDu fait que la convention est nulle, la d\u00e9fenderesse ne peut pas retenir les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s transport\u00e9es en garantie en vertu de cette convention.\nArr\u00eats mentionn\u00e9s: Re Coltman; Coltman c.

Un bref examen des proc\u00e9dures \u00e9crites aidera cependant \u00e0 d\u00e9finir les questions en jeu dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. Bien que les demandeurs (appelants en cette Cour) aient all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que Green\u2019s Garage a \u00e9mis des ch\u00e8ques \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de Consolidated Finance Corporation et de certaines autres soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de financement pour une somme totale de $76,031.97, que Breckenridge Speedway Ltd. en a \u00e9mis pour $36,398.49 et Twin Town Motors Ltd. pour $20,000, et qu\u2019avant la pr\u00e9sentation pour paiement d\u2019aucun desdits ch\u00e8ques Oscar Green, pour le compte de tous les appelants, en a contremand\u00e9 le paiement \u00e0 la Calder Treasury Branch, ils n\u2019ont pas pris de conclusions fond\u00e9es sur ces all\u00e9gations. Au proc\u00e8s, l\u2019avocat des appelants les a d\u00e9crites comme l\u2019essentiel de l\u2019historique de la transaction dans son ensemble.\nSur ce point, je suis d\u2019accord avec mon coll\u00e8gue, le Juge Hall, que peu importe qu\u2019il y ait eu ou non un contre-ordre de paiement des ch\u00e8ques, les demandeurs en ont ratifi\u00e9 le paiement; c\u2019est aussi ce qu\u2019a conclu \u00e0 juste titre le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance.\nLes demandeurs demandent essentiellement l\u2019annulation de la convention dat\u00e9e du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1958, intervenue entre Oscar Green, Irene Janet Green et Breckenridge Speedway Ltd. d\u2019une part et le Tr\u00e9sorier de la Province d\u2019autre part, au sujet de comptes \u00e0 la Calder Treasury Branch, et par laquelle les demandeurs ont convenu de transporter au Tr\u00e9sorier de la Province d\u2019Alberta les biens suivants: 1. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e sous le nom de Green\u2019s Garage situ\u00e9e \u00e0 Wainwright (Alberta) et accessoires.\n2.

La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Glenlyon, b\u00e2timents et terrains, en banlieue d\u2019Edmonton.\n6.

Campbell, de Viking Motors, \u00e0 Viking (Alberta).\nLe Tr\u00e9sorier de la Province s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 \u00e0 cr\u00e9diter aux comptes de Breckenridge Speedway Limited et de Green\u2019s Garage, \u00e0 la Calder Treasury Branch, les sommes mentionn\u00e9es aux actes de transport de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Wainwright, de celle de Green\u2019s Garage Body Shop, \u00e0 Edmonton, de la maison d\u2019Oscar et Irene Janet Green \u00e0 Edmonton, et de celles de Valleyview et de Glenlyon. Le Tr\u00e9sorier de la Province s\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9galement engag\u00e9 \u00e0 louer aux demandeurs les trois premi\u00e8res propri\u00e9t\u00e9s ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9es, pendant cinq ans, moyennant un loyer \u00e9gal \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de 6 pour cent l\u2019an sur la valeur des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e9tablie aux actes de transport plus les taxes annuelles. Les demandeurs avaient le privil\u00e8ge de faire des paiements sup\u00e9rieurs au loyer ainsi d\u00e9termin\u00e9 pour racheter ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s aux prix \u00e9tablis par les diff\u00e9rents actes de transport. Il \u00e9tait \u00e9galement entendu que les demandeurs se verraient accorder un cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l\u2019exploitation pendant cinq ans, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de $15,000.\nLes actes de transport ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9s au cours des mois de novembre et d\u00e9cembre 1958, et en \u00e9tablissent la valeur comme suit:\nLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Wainwright..............................................\n$35,000\nLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Green's Garage \u00e0 Edmonton...............\n16,000\nLa maison des Green \u00e0 Edmonton.................................\n12,000\nLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Valleyview...............................................\n1,500\nLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Glenlyon..................................................\n6,000 Les demandeurs, dans leur d\u00e9claration, ont all\u00e9gu\u00e9 l\u2019inex\u00e9cution de la convention sous plusieurs rapports et, en cons\u00e9quence, en ont demand\u00e9 la r\u00e9solution et r\u00e9clam\u00e9 la r\u00e9trocession des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s et le remboursement des sommes qu\u2019ils avaient vers\u00e9es \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse en vertu de cette convention.\nPar demande reconventionnelle, la d\u00e9fenderesse a r\u00e9clam\u00e9: des demandeurs Oscar Green et Irene Janet Green le paiement des sommes dues en vertu des baux relatifs aux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s vis\u00e9es par la convention; de Green\u2019s Garage et de Breckenridge Speedway Limited le paiement d\u2019un billet \u00e0 ordre souscrit par Green\u2019s Garage de m\u00eame que le remboursement de leur d\u00e9couvert de compte.\nC\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment que les demandeurs ont pr\u00e9tendu, dans leur d\u00e9fense \u00e0 la demande reconventionnelle, que tous les actes et conventions de la d\u00e9fenderesse vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019action \u00e9taient nuls parce que faits en vertu de la loi dite The Treasury Branches Act, S.R.A. 1955, c. 344 (ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9e \u00abla Loi\u00bb) et que cette Loi \u00e9tait ultra vires des pouvoirs de la L\u00e9gislature d\u2019Alberta.\nSur la demande en r\u00e9solution, le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu:\n[TRADUCTION] J\u2019ai \u00e9tudi\u00e9 toutes les pr\u00e9tentions des demandeurs et en les analysant je ne trouve pas qu\u2019elles justifient un recours en dommages ou en r\u00e9solution.\nSur ce point pr\u00e9cis, la Cour d\u2019appel a confirm\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9. A mon avis, cette conclusion n\u2019a pas \u00e0 \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e.\nQuant \u00e0 la demande reconventionnelle, le Juge en chef Smith et les Juges d\u2019appel Johnson et Kane ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis que les demandeurs, en tant qu\u2019emprunteurs, n\u2019avaient pas le droit d\u2019invoquer l\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 de la Loi comme moyen de d\u00e9fense. En cons\u00e9quence, ils n\u2019ont pas cru n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019adjuger sur cette question. Les Juges d\u2019appel Porter et Allen ont opin\u00e9 que la Loi \u00e9tait ultra vires des pouvoirs de la L\u00e9gislature d\u2019Alberta, parce qu\u2019elle se rapporte au \u00abcommerce de banque\u00bb, qui est de la comp\u00e9tence exclusive du Parlement du Canada. Tous les juges de la Cour d\u2019appel, \u00e0 l\u2019exception du Juge Porter, ont opin\u00e9 que les transports de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s faits en ex\u00e9cution de la convention du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1958 constituaient un paiement partiel de la dette des demandeurs, sauf que ceux des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de Wainwright, de Green\u2019s Garage Body Shop et de la maison des Green, qu\u2019on leur avait lou\u00e9es, n\u2019avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s qu\u2019en garantie et non en paiement partiel.\nEn cons\u00e9quence, la Cour d\u2019appel a modifi\u00e9 le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance qui rejetait l\u2019action des demandeurs et accueillait la demande reconventionnelle de la d\u00e9fenderesse en biffant du jugement la disposition qui autorisait la d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e0 prendre possession de ces trois propri\u00e9t\u00e9s.\nA mon avis, le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel est bien fond\u00e9, et j\u2019en arrive \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision sans trouver n\u00e9cessaire de statuer sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la Loi. Les questions \u00e0 d\u00e9cider dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi sont le droit de la d\u00e9fenderesse de recouvrer des demandeurs les sommes que leur a pr\u00eat\u00e9es la Treasury Branch et la validit\u00e9 de la convention du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1958, par laquelle le titre \u00e0 certaines propri\u00e9t\u00e9s des demandeurs passait \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse, soit \u00e0 titre de paiement partiel soit en garantie de paiement.\nL\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9, dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, est \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la Loi \u00e9tant invalide parce qu\u2019elle se rapporte au commerce de banque, le Tr\u00e9sorier de la Province n\u2019avait pas, en droit, le pouvoir de pr\u00eater aux demandeurs les sommes que de fait il leur a avanc\u00e9es. M\u00eame si cette pr\u00e9tention \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e, la jurisprudence qu\u2019a cit\u00e9e mon coll\u00e8gue, le Juge Hall, et celle qu\u2019on trouve dans les motifs du Juge en chef Smith et du Juge d\u2019appel Johnson d\u00e9montrent clairement que, comme la transaction n\u2019avait rien d\u2019ill\u00e9gal et que tout au plus le Tr\u00e9sorier de la Province n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de faire cr\u00e9dit, les demandeurs n\u2019avaient pas de d\u00e9fense \u00e0 opposer \u00e0 l\u2019action en recouvrement des sommes en tant qu\u2019argents re\u00e7us. Des affaires cit\u00e9es dans ces motifs, je ne mentionnerai que les deux suivantes: Re Coltman; Coltman v. Coltman[2]; In re K.L. Tractors Ltd.[3] II en r\u00e9sulte donc que, ind\u00e9pendamment de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la Loi, les demandeurs sont l\u00e9galement tenus de rembourser les sommes que la d\u00e9fenderesse leur a vers\u00e9es.\nApr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tabli ce point, je m\u2019attacherai maintenant \u00e0 la convention du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1958 et aux transports de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 faits en ex\u00e9cution de cette derni\u00e8re. Par elle, les demandeurs s\u2019engageaient \u00e0 c\u00e9der \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse certaines propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, soit \u00e0 titre de paiement partiel de leur dette soit en garantie du remboursement de celle-ci. Les actes de transport ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi d\u2019Alberta et le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le Tr\u00e9sorier de la Province. Il n\u2019y a rien d\u2019ill\u00e9gal \u00e0 ce que la d\u00e9fenderesse devienne propri\u00e9taire d\u2019immeubles situ\u00e9s en Alberta.\nLes demandeurs veulent qu\u2019un jugement ordonne \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse de leur r\u00e9troc\u00e9der les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s. Ils pr\u00e9tendent que la convention est nulle du fait qu\u2019elle est intervenue dans l\u2019exploitation d\u2019un commerce de banque, ce qui n\u2019est pas de la comp\u00e9tence de la Province. Mais l\u2019objet de la convention, sauf la promesse de faire cr\u00e9dit aux demandeurs qui n\u2019est pas en litige ici, \u00e9tait de pourvoir au remboursement ou \u00e0 la garantie d\u2019une obligation en souffrance. Pour les motifs que j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9s, les demandeurs ne peuvent pas se soustraire \u00e0 cette obligation de rembourser, m\u00eame si les pr\u00eats avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits sans autorisation l\u00e9gale. Dans les circonstances, je ne vois pas comment les demandeurs pourraient r\u00e9clamer ce qu\u2019ils ont c\u00e9d\u00e9 en paiement ou en garantie de paiement des sommes qu\u2019ils devaient l\u00e9galement \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse.\nLe Conseil priv\u00e9 a eu \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre une question \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s semblable dans l\u2019affaire Ayers v. The South Australian Banking Company[4]. Dans cette affaire-l\u00e0, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une loi de l\u2019Australie m\u00e9ridionale qui permettait le nantissement de laine sans d\u00e9livrance mat\u00e9rielle au cr\u00e9ancier gagiste. La banque avait fait \u00e0 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 une avance de fonds garantie par un tel nantissement. La banque a intent\u00e9 contre le syndic de la faillite de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui avait contract\u00e9 l\u2019emprunt, une action en d\u00e9tournement (in trover) pour recouvrer une somme \u00e9gale \u00e0 la valeur de la laine. Un des moyens de d\u00e9fense \u00e9tait que les statuts de la banque renfermaient une disposition lui interdisant de faire des pr\u00eats garantis par des marchandises.\nLa banque a eu gain de cause. Voici ce que dit de ce moyen de d\u00e9fense le Lord Juge Mellish, \u00e0 la p. 558:\n[TRADUCTION] M. Manisty a soulev\u00e9 un autre point au sujet des statuts (de l\u2019intim\u00e9e), il a invoqu\u00e9 l\u2019article qui stipule qu\u2019il ne sera pas permis \u00e0 la Banque de faire des pr\u00eats garantis par des marchandises. L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de cet article pourrait sans doute soulever bon nombre de probl\u00e8mes qui sont s\u00fbrement d\u2019un grand int\u00e9r\u00eat, mais \u00e9galement tr\u00e8s difficiles \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre, aussi leurs Seigneuries ne croient-ils pas n\u00e9cessaire de donner leur avis \u00e0 ce sujet. On peut se demander quelles sont en v\u00e9rit\u00e9 les op\u00e9rations auxquelles la disposition s\u2019applique et en particulier si elle s\u2019applique \u00e0 cette affaire-ci. On peut aussi se demander si, de toute fa\u00e7on, le fait de passer outre \u00e0 cette interdiction n\u2019a pas comme seule cons\u00e9quence de permettre \u00e0 la Couronne d\u2019annuler les lettres-patentes. Le seul point que leurs Seigneuries jugent n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9claircir en rapport avec la pr\u00e9sente affaire est le suivant: quelle que soit la port\u00e9e de cette disposition, elle n\u2019emp\u00eache pas la translation du titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 aux marchandises ou aux immeubles, s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019autre cause de nullit\u00e9. La seule d\u00e9fense qu\u2019on pourrait soulever ici (on ne plaide pas l\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9) est celle du d\u00e9faut de possession, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que les demandeurs n\u2019ont jamais acquis ni droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ni droit de possession. Leurs Seigneuries sont d\u2019avis que quelles qu\u2019en soient les autres cons\u00e9quences, la disposition n\u2019a pas pour effet d\u2019emp\u00eacher la translation du titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nIl y a d\u2019autres circonstances dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire qui sont \u00e0 l\u2019avantage de la d\u00e9fenderesse. Il n\u2019y a pas ici de conflit avec les droits d\u2019autres cr\u00e9anciers des demandeurs. De plus, la d\u00e9fense a un autre atout encore plus important. Si la Loi est inconstitutionnelle, comme le pr\u00e9tendent les demandeurs, le Tr\u00e9sorier de la province, qui est un ministre de la Couronne, aurait outrepass\u00e9 ses pouvoirs en pr\u00eatant de l\u2019argent aux demandeurs. Les fonds ainsi pr\u00eat\u00e9s appartenaient \u00e0 la Couronne; les pr\u00eats aux demandeurs constitueraient donc un emploi non-autoris\u00e9 des deniers de la Couronne, auquel les demandeurs et le Tr\u00e9sorier de la province auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 parties. L\u2019acte abusif du ministre de la Couronne ne pourrait pas emp\u00eacher cette derni\u00e8re d\u2019exiger le paiement des sommes vers\u00e9es. Ce n\u2019est pas au Tr\u00e9sorier de la province que les demandeurs ont transport\u00e9 les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mais bien \u00e0 la Couronne. Ces transports tenaient lieu de paiement ou de garantie de paiement de sommes d\u2019argent que les demandeurs sont l\u00e9galement tenus de rembourser. La Couronne a, en droit, un bon titre \u00e0 ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s.\nLes demandeurs ne peuvent pas exiger la r\u00e9trocession des immeubles par la Couronne \u00e0 moins qu\u2019ils ne puissent prouver qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas oblig\u00e9s de rembourser les sommes dont les immeubles effectuaient, en partie, le remboursement ou le garantissaient. Si leur pr\u00e9tention que la loi est inconstitutionnelle est fond\u00e9e, ils ne peuvent pas faire cette preuve parce qu\u2019alors ils ont touch\u00e9 de l\u2019argent de la Couronne en vertu d\u2019un acte abusif d\u2019un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de la Couronne, acte auquel ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 parties.\nEn d\u00e9finitive, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas une d\u00e9fense \u00e0 la demande reconventionnelle de la d\u00e9fenderesse et, dans les circonstances, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider si la Loi est ultra vires des pouvoirs de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e l\u00e9gislative d\u2019Alberta.\nLa seule question qui reste est de savoir si les transports \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de Wainwright, de Green\u2019s Garage Body Shop et de la maison des Green constituaient des cessions pures et simples en paiement partiel de la dette des demandeurs ou si elles n\u2019\u00e9taient que des transports en garantie. Pour les motifs qu\u2019a exprim\u00e9s le Juge d\u2019appel Allen et auxquels le Juge en chef Smith et les Juges d\u2019appel Johnson et Kane ont souscrit, je suis d\u2019avis que le transport de ces trois propri\u00e9t\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019en garantie.\nA mon avis, il faut confirmer le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel. En cons\u00e9quence, je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens et le contre-appel avec d\u00e9pens. L\u2019intervenant n\u2019a droit \u00e0 aucun d\u00e9pens.\nLe jugement des Juges Hall et Spence a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par\nLE JUGE HALL (en partie dissident)\u2014Il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019un pourvoi \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un arr\u00eat de la division d\u2019appel de la Cour Supr\u00eame de l\u2019Alberta[5] rendu sur l\u2019appel d\u2019un jugement du Juge Primrose. Par leur action, les appelants, pr\u00e9tendant que la Calder Treasury Branch avait pay\u00e9 sans droit certains ch\u00e8ques dont le paiement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 contremand\u00e9, demandaient la r\u00e9solution d\u2019une convention intervenue entre eux et l\u2019intim\u00e9e le 8 d\u00e9cembre 1958, la r\u00e9trocession de certaines propri\u00e9t\u00e9s que les appelants avaient transport\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e en mai 1959 et une reddition de compte. Par demande reconventionnelle, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 la possession des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s et un jugement pour le montant de certains loyers et pr\u00eats d\u2019argent. Le Juge Primrose a d\u00e9bout\u00e9 les appelants de leur action et a donn\u00e9 jugement \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e lui accordant, entre autres choses, la possession des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s. Dans leur demande, les appelants all\u00e9guaient que la loi de la province d\u2019Alberta intitul\u00e9e The Treasury Branches Act est ultra vires. La division d\u2019appel, tout en jugeant que cette loi est ultra vires, a n\u00e9anmoins confirm\u00e9 le jugement du Juge Primrose refusant la r\u00e9solution de la convention et donnant jugement pour la somme r\u00e9clam\u00e9e dans la demande reconventionnelle. Cependant, elle a trouv\u00e9 que trois des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s dont il est question dans l\u2019action avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9es en garantie et elle a ordonn\u00e9 une reddition de compte \u00e0 ce sujet. Les trois propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en question sont d\u00e9sign\u00e9es partout dans la preuve et les jugements comme (a) \u00abGreen\u2019s Body Shop\u00bb, (b) la \u00abmaison\u00bb, (c) la \u00abpropri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Wainwright\u00bb.\nLes appelants, demandeurs dans l\u2019action, par leur pourvoi devant cette Cour, all\u00e8guent que le Juge Primrose et la division d\u2019appel ont fait erreur:\n1. En ne d\u00e9cidant pas que les sommes d\u00e9bours\u00e9es par la Calder Treasury Branch en paiement de ch\u00e8ques des appelants pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s apr\u00e8s un contre-ordre de paiement n\u2019\u00e9taient pas recouvrables.\n2. En d\u00e9cidant que, dans ces circonstances, il n\u2019\u00e9tait ni juste, ni \u00e9quitable que les appelants plaident que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir, du point de vue constitutionnel, de faire des conventions et prendre des garanties sur immeuble pour obtenir le remboursement des sommes pay\u00e9es pour des ch\u00e8ques contremand\u00e9s.\n3. En ne d\u00e9cidant pas que dans ces circonstances les appelants avaient de droit de plaider l\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9. 4. En ne concluant pas que la Calder Treasury Branch avait fait les conventions et pris les garanties dans l\u2019exercice d\u2019un commerce de banque, que le Tr\u00e9sorier de la Province de l\u2019Alberta exploitait en vertu, ou par abus, des dispositions de la loi dite The Treasury Branches Act, ch. 344 des Statuts revis\u00e9s de l\u2019Alberta, 1955 et amendements.\n5. En ne concluant pas que ladite loi The Treasury Branches Act est ultra vires des pouvoirs de la Province d\u2019Alberta en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique.\n6. En ne concluant pas que ledit commerce de banque est ultra vires des pouvoirs de la Province d\u2019Alberta en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique.\n7. En ne concluant pas que les conventions faites et garanties prises sont ultra vires des pouvoirs de la Province d\u2019Alberta en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique.\n8. En ne concluant pas que, pour ces motifs, la Cour ne peut rendre lesdites conventions et garanties ex\u00e9cutoires.\n9. En ne concluant pas que, dans les circonstances, les appelants avaient droit \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution desdites conventions.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e a donn\u00e9 avis de son intention de se pourvoir par contre-appel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la division d\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Wainwright pour faire r\u00e9tablir la d\u00e9cision du Juge Primrose. L\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend avoir droit \u00e0 cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 comme propri\u00e9taire r\u00e9el, libre de tout droit de rachat en faveur de l\u2019appelante Breckenridge Speedway Ltd. et soutient qu\u2019aucun des appelants n\u2019en a eu la possession depuis 1960. Lors de l\u2019audition devant cette Cour, permission a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e de modifier le contre-appel et d\u2019y inclure, outre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Wainwright, les autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u00e9sign\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant \u00abGreen\u2019s Body Shop\u00bb et \u00abla maison\u00bb.\nLe 30 octobre 1967, le Juge en chef du Canada a rendu l\u2019ordonnance suivante:\n[TRADUCTION] IL EST ORDONN\u00c9 de faire signifier imm\u00e9diatement au Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, et aux correspondants \u00e0 Ottawa des Procureurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux des Provinces, sauf le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Alberta qui est d\u00e9j\u00e0 partie, un avis de la question constitutionnelle soulev\u00e9e dans ce pourvoi, avec une copie des motifs de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la division d\u2019appel de la Cour Supr\u00eame de l\u2019Alberta et une copie de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, laquelle question constitutionnelle peut \u00eatre \u00e9nonc\u00e9e comme suit:\n1. \u00abLa Loi dite The Treasury Branches Act, ch. 344 des Statuts revis\u00e9s de l\u2019Alberta et amendements, est-elle ultra vires des pouvoirs de la province de l\u2019Alberta en tant que loi relative au commerce de \u00abbanque\u00bb en contravention des dispositions de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique?\n2. Les affaires transig\u00e9es par les Treasury Branch de la province d\u2019Alberta sont\u2011elles ultra vires des pouvoirs de la Province d\u2019Alberta parce que ces affaires ne sont pas autoris\u00e9es par la loi?\u00bb\nET IL EST DE PLUS ORDONN\u00c9 que toutes les demandes d\u2019intervention soient rapportables \u00e0 l\u2019hon. Juge en chef du Canada, en chambre, le 27e jour de novembre 1967, \u00e0 10 heures du matin.\nLe Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada demanda \u00e0 intervenir dans la cause. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 se faire repr\u00e9senter par avocat et \u00e0 produire un factum. Aucune province n\u2019a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 intervenir.\nLes faits qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 ce litige et \u00e0 la question constitutionnelle sus-mentionn\u00e9e sont compliqu\u00e9s et ils furent contest\u00e9s au d\u00e9but. Les appelants, Oscar Green et Irene Janet Green, sont mari et femme. Pendant tout le temps o\u00f9 se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s les faits pertinents au litige, Mme Green \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire d\u2019un garage \u00e0 Edmonton (Alberta) connu sous le nom de \u00abGreen\u2019s Garage\u00bb. Un autre appelant, Breckenridge Speedway Ltd. (ci-apr\u00e8s nomm\u00e9e \u00abBreckenridge\u00bb) exploitait un garage \u00e0 Wainwright, dans la m\u00eame province. Green\u2019s Garage et Breckenridge \u00e9taient tous deux g\u00e9r\u00e9s par Oscar Green.\nEn 1956, Green\u2019s Garage faisait la vente d\u2019automobiles neuves et usag\u00e9es, \u00e0 Edmonton et ailleurs dans la province, tandis que Breckenridge exploitait le m\u00eame commerce \u00e0 Wainwright. Green\u2019s Garage achetait ses voitures neuves d\u2019un concessionnaire connu sous le nom de \u00abWaterloo Motors\u00bb tandis qu\u2019\u00e0 Wainwright, Breckenridge les achetait directement de la compagnie Ford. Les op\u00e9rations en cause dans ces proc\u00e8s impliquaient le financement des achats d\u2019automobiles par une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui, dans la preuve, est d\u00e9sign\u00e9e sous le nom de \u00abConsolidated Finance\u00bb (ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9e \u00abConsolidated\u00bb). Lorsque Green\u2019s Garage commandait une voiture \u00e0 Waterloo, la livraison \u00e9tait faite \u00e0 charge d\u2019un nantissement donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Consolidated par Waterloo pour le prix de gros. Consolidated payait alors la voiture \u00e0 Waterloo et la livrait \u00e0 Green\u2019s Garage, grev\u00e9e d\u2019un nantissement pour se garantir. On disait de ces voitures qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient \u00aben financement de gros\u00bb. Quand Green\u2019s Garage vendait la voiture \u00e0 cr\u00e9dit par contrat de vente conditionnelle, il \u00e9mettait un ch\u00e8que \u00e0 Consolidated pour acquitter le financement de gros et r\u00e9gler le nantissement. Consolidated remettait alors \u00e0 Green\u2019s Garage un ch\u00e8que \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de celui-ci repr\u00e9sentant le montant \u00e0 recevoir du client en vertu du contrat de vente conditionnelle. Si l\u2019acheteur manquait \u00e0 ses engagements en vertu du contrat de vente conditionnelle, on reprenait l\u2019automobile qui \u00e9tait remise sur le financement de gros en vertu d\u2019un contrat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral intervenu entre Green\u2019s Garage et Consolidated. Le solde d\u00fb \u00e9tait alors d\u00e9duit des sommes payables en vertu des autres contrats de vente conditionnelle c\u00e9d\u00e9s \u00e0 Consolidated. Cette m\u00e9thode, \u00e0 cause du nombre de voitures qu\u2019elle impliquait, finit par donner lieu \u00e0 une dispute ou m\u00e9sentente entre Green\u2019s Garage et Consolidated quant au montant de l\u2019endettement de Green\u2019s Garage envers Consolidated.\nEn septembre 1956, Green\u2019s Garage jugea que Consolidated retenait sans raison la somme de $11,600 en rapport avec des v\u00e9hicules repris. Pour renforcer sa situation vis-\u00e0-vis Consolidated, Green\u2019s Garage retint les contrats de vente conditionelle relatifs aux nouvelles ventes au lieu de les livrer imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 Consolidated comme il avait eu l\u2019habitude de le faire. A chacun des contrats, on trouvait attach\u00e9 un ch\u00e8que de Green\u2019s Garage ou de Breckenridge en faveur de Consolidated pour le montant du financement de gros sur le contrat en question.\nOscar Green, l\u2019un des appelants, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que Green\u2019s Garage voulait retenir les contrats de vente conditionnelle et les ch\u00e8ques jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le diff\u00e9rend avec Consolidated au sujet des voitures reprises soit r\u00e9gl\u00e9. Il a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, vers la fin de septembre 1956, alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait absent pour la fin de semaine, un repr\u00e9sentant de Consolidated est venu au Green\u2019s Garage et s\u2019est empar\u00e9 d\u2019une bo\u00eete pleine de contrats de vente conditionnelle avec les ch\u00e8ques y attach\u00e9s. Green a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant de ce fait \u00e0 son retour le dimanche soir. Les ch\u00e8ques \u00e9taient tir\u00e9s sur la Treasury Branch de Calder (une agence de celle d\u2019Edmonton) \u00e9tablie par le Tr\u00e9sorier de la Province d\u2019Alberta en vertu des dispositions de la loi dite The Treasury Branches Act, S.R.A. 1942, c. 29. Green\u2019s Garage d\u00e9posait des fonds \u00e0 l\u2019agence de Calder tout au long de 1956 (il \u00e9tait un d\u00e9posant depuis 1950). En 1956, au moment de sa constitution, Breckenridge est devenu un d\u00e9posant \u00e0 l\u2019agence de Calder. En 1955, M. et Mme Green avaient fait des emprunts \u00e0 la Treasury Branch de Calder et ils avaient souscrit en avril et en novembre 1955 des billets au montant de $2,600 et de $10,500 respectivement. De fait, les appelants, Green\u2019s Garage et Breckenridge faisaient leurs op\u00e9rations bancaires \u00e0 l\u2019agence de Calder du Treasury Department.\nOscar Green a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, le lendemain du jour o\u00f9 il a appris que le repr\u00e9sentant de Consolidated avait pris les contrats de vente conditionnelle et les ch\u00e8ques, il a dans la matin\u00e9e avis\u00e9 un nomm\u00e9 Skelton, g\u00e9rant de la Treasury Branch \u00e0 Calder, de refuser le paiement des ch\u00e8ques pris par Consolidated. Il a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, malgr\u00e9 le contre-ordre de paiement, Skelton a honor\u00e9 les ch\u00e8ques et remis l\u2019argent \u00e0 Consolidated. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de Green, le montant total de ces ch\u00e8ques \u00e9tait de $198,985.86, d\u2019o\u00f9 un d\u00e9couvert consid\u00e9rable dans le compte de Green\u2019s Garage. Le 5 octobre 1956, ce d\u00e9couvert se chiffrait \u00e0 $123,322.99. Le 3 octobre 1956, des ch\u00e8ques pour une somme de $36,398.49 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9bit\u00e9s au compte de Breckenridge; le solde cr\u00e9diteur de ce compte \u00e9tant important, il ne se trouva pas \u00e0 d\u00e9couvert.\nLa preuve montre clairement que Skelton n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 faire cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 Green\u2019s Garage \u00e0 concurrence du d\u00e9couvert au 5 octobre 1956. Skelton a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 honorer les ch\u00e8ques tir\u00e9s par Green\u2019s Garage, de sorte que le 20 octobre 1956 ce dernier devait $142,546 \u00e0 la Treasury Branch. Breckenridge devait $6,680.67 \u00e0 la m\u00eame date. Pour les appelants le contre-ordre de paiement des ch\u00e8ques pris par Consolidated est d\u2019une importance capitale. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Green, le contre-ordre a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 verbalement. Le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a trouv\u00e9 qu\u2019en fait le contre-ordre a r\u00e9ellement \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9. Voici ce qu\u2019il dit \u00e0 ce sujet:\n[TRADUCTION] L\u2019affaire a abouti quand les demandeurs, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9mis des ch\u00e8ques \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de financement, ont donn\u00e9 ordre \u00e0 Skelton d\u2019en refuser le paiement. Je ne doute pas que Skelton ait re\u00e7u cette directive mais, quelques jours plus tard, il alla trouver le demandeur Green, pour lui dire qu\u2019il avait pay\u00e9 les ch\u00e8ques.\nLes appelants se fondent sur cette conclusion de fait comme sur la conclusion cl\u00e9, la pierre angulaire, de leur cause.\nLa preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette conclusion est mince. Skelton n\u2019a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s. Il ressort du t\u00e9moignage de M.H. Pitcher, administrateur des liquidations au bureau-chef des Treasury Branch \u00e0 Edmonton, que Green n\u2019a pas parl\u00e9 de cela avant le mois de d\u00e9cembre 1960. Green, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir dit \u00e0 Pitcher et \u00e0 un nomm\u00e9 Olive, surintendant \u00e0 la Treasury Branch, lors d\u2019une entrevue au bureau du directeur vers octobre ou novembre 1956, qu\u2019il avait contremand\u00e9 le paiement des ch\u00e8ques mais que Skelton les avait pay\u00e9s quand m\u00eame. On n\u2019entendit plus parler de cette question si importante jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que Green en fasse mention dans une lettre, dat\u00e9e du 17 d\u00e9cembre 1960 et adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Pitcher. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, je ne peux donner \u00e0 la conclusion sur ce point l\u2019effet que les appelants pr\u00e9tendent qu\u2019elle doit avoir. Peu importe que le paiement des ch\u00e8ques ait \u00e9t\u00e9 contremand\u00e9 et qu\u2019on ait pass\u00e9 outre \u00e0 cet ordre, la preuve \u00e9tablit clairement que les appelants ont ratifi\u00e9 le paiement des ch\u00e8ques, conclusion \u00e0 laquelle le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9 d\u2019arriver. Les appelants ont continu\u00e9 \u00e0 transiger avec la Calder Treasury Branch, en prenant pour acquis qu\u2019ils avaient re\u00e7u les sommes que repr\u00e9sentaient les ch\u00e8ques et qu\u2019ils les devaient \u00e0 la Treasury Branch. Le 20 octobre 1956, ils ont souscrit en sa faveur des billets au montant total de $140,000, soit le d\u00e9couvert total, \u00e0 date, des comptes de Green\u2019s Garage et de Breckenridge. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve et les livres de la Treasury Branch, les appelants devaient $150,558.10 au 8 d\u00e9cembre 1958.\nC\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 qu\u2019est intervenue la convention que j\u2019\u00e9tudierai plus loin, car elle a une tr\u00e8s grande importance dans la d\u00e9termination des droits des parties, notamment ceux de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 certaines propri\u00e9t\u00e9s dont on a alors dispos\u00e9.

Pitcher\nM.H. Pitcher\npour le surintendant.\nPour donner suite \u00e0 cette convention, les parties sign\u00e8rent, en mai 1959, quatre baux avec option d\u2019achat se rapportant aux articles nos 1, 2, 3 et 7 de la convention et ces baux furent remis aux appelants. On doit consid\u00e9rer que ces baux avec option d\u2019achat font partie de la convention du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1958. Sans analyser les baux eux-m\u00eames, on doit dire que chacun d\u2019eux stipulait le paiement d\u2019un loyer d\u00e9termin\u00e9. Pendant quelque temps, les appelants ont pay\u00e9 le loyer des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s vis\u00e9es par les diff\u00e9rents baux mais ils ont fini par cesser de le faire. Au moment du proc\u00e8s, ils ne payaient aucun loyer bien qu\u2019ils eussent encore la jouissance des diff\u00e9rentes propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en vertu des baux. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Wainwright a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue apr\u00e8s le proc\u00e8s et, du consentement des parties (voir la minute du jugement), le produit de la vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 en fiducie pour qu\u2019on en dispose comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Wainwright.

De plus cette question est \u00e9galement \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer en regard de la pr\u00e9tention des appelants que, nonobstant leur obligation de rembourser les sommes emprunt\u00e9es, si la loi intitul\u00e9e The Treasury Branches Act est ultra vires, les garanties et les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qu\u2019ils ont transport\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e par la convention du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1958 doivent leur \u00eatre remises.\nJe vais traiter premi\u00e8rement de la question de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de la loi intitul\u00e9e The Treasury Branches Act, deuxi\u00e8mement de l\u2019obligation des appelants de rembourser les sommes qu\u2019ils ont re\u00e7ues de la Treasury Branch, m\u00eame si la loi est ultra vires, troisi\u00e8mement de la pr\u00e9tention des appelants quant \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 et aux cons\u00e9quences de la convention du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1958, et finalement de leur demande de r\u00e9solution et de dommages.\nLa Cour d\u2019appel a d\u00e9j\u00e0 examin\u00e9 la question de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de The Treasury Branches Act. Le Juge en chef Smith de la division d\u2019appel, avec lequel les Juges d\u2019appel Johnson et Kane ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019accord, n\u2019a pas trouv\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019aborder ce point, ayant jug\u00e9 que les appelants ne pouvaient soulever le probl\u00e8me de l\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 dans leur action. \u00c9videmment, cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise avant que le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada n\u2019intervienne pour contester la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de The Treasury Branches Act. Le Juge d\u2019appel Johnson, comme le Juge en chef Smith et le Juge d\u2019appel Allen, a trouv\u00e9 que la convention du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1958 cr\u00e9ait des hypoth\u00e8ques en \u00e9quit\u00e9 (equitable mortgages) sur le \u00abGreen\u2019s Garage Body Shop\u00bb, \u00abla maison\u00bb et la \u00abpropri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Wainwright\u00bb. Les Juges d\u2019appel Porter et Allen, dans des motifs distincts, ont conclu que The Treasury Branches Act \u00e9tait ultra vires. Tous deux ont reconnu aux appelants le droit d\u2019invoquer, dans leur action, l\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 de la loi. Voici ce que dit le Juge d\u2019appel Allen \u00e0 ce sujet:\n[TRADUCTION] Il est bien \u00e9vident d\u2019apr\u00e8s la fa\u00e7on dont je disposerais de cet appel que je consid\u00e8re que rien n\u2019emp\u00eachait les demandeurs de soulever dans leur action l\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 de leurs conventions avec les Treasury Branch.\nLe Juge d\u2019appel Porter dit:\n[TRADUCTION] La d\u00e9fenderesse pr\u00e9tend cependant que la loi emp\u00eache les demandeurs d\u2019invoquer comme d\u00e9fense \u00e0 la demande reconventionnelle au sujet des transports, l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de la loi cr\u00e9ant les soi-disant Treasury Branch.\nSi tel est le cas, nous en arrivons \u00e0 la conclusion \u00e9trange que la d\u00e9fenderesse peut obtenir jugement pour les sommes d\u2019argent, garder les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qu\u2019elle s\u2019est fait transporter et r\u00e9aliser ses garanties. Qu\u2019est-ce que ce justiciable a bien pu faire pour que la Cour lui dise, de m\u00eame qu\u2019\u00e0 ses cr\u00e9anciers, que la Couronne a droit de garder ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s obtenues \u00e0 la faveur d\u2019une convention qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas le droit de faire?\nJe suis aussi de cet avis. Ce n\u2019est pas parce que les appelants ne peuvent soulever la question de l\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 de la loi que l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut recouvrer l\u2019argent qu\u2019elle a pr\u00eat\u00e9 mais bien parce que, ind\u00e9pendamment de cette question, les appelants doivent remettre les sommes qu\u2019ils ont re\u00e7ues. Je ne crois pas pouvoir utilement ajouter quoi que ce soit sous ce rapport aux motifs du Juge d\u2019appel Porter[6]. Il a fait l\u2019historique complet de la loi et il a examin\u00e9 \u00e0 fond ses relations avec le commerce de banque. Il a termin\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 comme suit:\n[TRADUCTION] A mon sens, la loi intitul\u00e9e The Treasury Branches Act est nulle parce qu\u2019elle empi\u00e8te sur un domaine l\u00e9gislatif o\u00f9 elle ne peut s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 cause de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative exclusive dans ce domaine d\u00e9volue au Canada.\nJe suis aussi d\u2019accord avec le Juge d\u2019appel Porter lorsqu\u2019il affirme qu\u2019on ne peut dire que les op\u00e9rations des Treasury Branch constituent des actes d\u2019exercice de la pr\u00e9rogative royale et sont donc valides m\u00eame si la loi est ultra vires. Voici ce que dit le Juge Porter \u00e0 propos de cette pr\u00e9tention:\n[TRADUCTION] \u00abComme on le verra dans l\u2019\u00e9tude ci-apr\u00e8s de la l\u00e9gislation sur les Treasury Branch, le droit de la Couronne de les exploiter d\u00e9coule de la l\u00e9gislation, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0-dire de la loi The Treasury Branches Act. Cons\u00e9quemment l\u2019exploitation n\u2019en peut pas constituer un acte d\u2019exercice de la pr\u00e9rogative royale, qui d\u00e9coule de la common law et non du droit statutaire. Halsbury, Laws of England, 3e \u00e9d. vol. 7, p. 221:\n[TRADUCTION] 463 \u2026 La pr\u00e9rogative royale se d\u00e9finit comme \u00e9tant cette pr\u00e9\u00e9minence dont jouit le Souverain sur toute autre personne en vertu de la common law, non en tant que personne ordinaire mais en raison de sa dignit\u00e9 royale. Elle comprend toutes les dignit\u00e9s, libert\u00e9s, privil\u00e8ges, pouvoirs et droits royaux sp\u00e9ciaux que la common law attribue \u00e0 la Couronne d\u2019Angleterre.\n464 \u2026 En cons\u00e9quence, la pr\u00e9rogative d\u00e9coule et rel\u00e8ve de la common law, le Souverain ne peut en r\u00e9clamer d\u2019autres que celles que lui reconna\u00eet la loi, et il n\u2019en peut r\u00e9clamer aucune \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la Grande Charte, d\u2019un autre statut, ou des libert\u00e9s des citoyens.\nDe plus, la pr\u00e9rogative de la Couronne du chef de la province est corr\u00e9lative de la division des comp\u00e9tences l\u00e9gislatives \u00e9tablies par l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique, entre le f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et les provinces. La pr\u00e9rogative de la Couronne du chef de la Province ne peut s\u2019appliquer aux affaires que la loi intitul\u00e9e The Treasury Branches Act est cens\u00e9e autoriser \u00e0 moins que cette loi ne soit elle-m\u00eame de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative de la province. Dans l\u2019affaire Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Company Limited v. Rex [1916] 1 A.C. 566, le vicomte Haldane dit, \u00e0 la p. 580:\n[TRADUCTION] \u00ab\u2026selon la nouvelle constitution, la r\u00e9partition du pouvoir ex\u00e9cutif suit la r\u00e9partition du pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif.\u00bb\nEn toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne suis pas de l\u2019avis du savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance que l\u2019exploitation des Treasury Branch constitue un acte d\u2019exercice de la pr\u00e9rogative royale.\u00bb\nLe fait que la loi intitul\u00e9e The Treasury Branches Act est ultra vires ne peut priver l\u2019intim\u00e9e du droit de recouvrer les sommes qu\u2019elle a pr\u00eat\u00e9es aux appelants \u00e0 titre d\u2019argent re\u00e7u. Le droit sur ce point est bien d\u00e9fini par le Juge Lush, dans l\u2019affaire Brougham v. Dwyer[7]. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une action intent\u00e9e par une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, en recouvrement d\u2019un pr\u00eat \u00e0 titre d\u2019argent re\u00e7u. Le pr\u00eat avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait au moyen d\u2019un d\u00e9couvert, alors que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 pr\u00eater de cette fa\u00e7on. Le Juge Lush dit, \u00e0 la p. 505:\n[TRADUCTION] Si l\u2019on consid\u00e8re le sens v\u00e9ritable de l\u2019affirmation que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de construction n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de faire cette op\u00e9ration, toute l\u2019affaire devient claire. Les administrateurs de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, croyant agir en son nom et conclure un contrat pour son compte, ont pr\u00eat\u00e9 son argent au d\u00e9fendeur au moyen d\u2019un d\u00e9couvert. Il s\u2019est trouv\u00e9 qu\u2019en droit, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de conclure un tel contrat. Il s\u2019ensuit que le contrat que les administrateurs croyaient avoir conclu n\u2019en \u00e9tait pas un, mais constituait une op\u00e9ration qui, aux yeux de la loi, \u00e9tait inexistante. En cons\u00e9quence, le d\u00e9fendeur avait re\u00e7u des sommes d\u2019argent appartenant \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de construction en vertu d\u2019une op\u00e9ration sans aucune validit\u00e9. Si tel \u00e9tait le cas, j\u2019aurais d\u00fb conclure que, faute de contrat, il y avait lieu \u00e0 une action pour argent re\u00e7u.\nPlus loin, il dit encore:\n[TRADUCTION] Mais si l\u2019on se rappelle le sens de l\u2019expression ultra vires, l\u2019affaire est tout autre. Le contrat n\u2019\u00e9tait inexistant que du seul fait que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de construction n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de le conclure. Il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019autre cause de nullit\u00e9 de ce contrat et il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas ill\u00e9gal de sa nature; mais, parce que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de le conclure, il n\u2019avait pas d\u2019existence en droit. Dans les circonstances, on pouvait accueillir l\u2019action, le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019ayant pas de d\u00e9fense. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une action en recouvrement de sommes pr\u00eat\u00e9es en vertu d\u2019une op\u00e9ration qu\u2019on croyait valide, mais qui de fait ne l\u2019\u00e9tait pas. En principe, je ne vois pas pourquoi on ne devrait pas accueillir une telle action. La Cour d\u2019appel, dans l\u2019affaire Coltman, Coltman v. Coltman, (1881) 19 Ch. D. 64 a statu\u00e9 clairement que, dans un cas tel que celui-ci, si le contrat n\u2019est pas ill\u00e9gal, il n\u2019y a pas de d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l\u2019action. Je suis donc d\u2019avis qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de d\u00e9fense \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente action et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence l\u2019appel devrait \u00eatre accueilli.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, je suis d\u2019accord avec le Juge en chef Smith lorsque, dans ses motifs, il dit:\n[TRADUCTION] Je ne doute pas que la Province d\u2019Alberta peut recouvrer, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat, les sommes qu\u2019elle a pr\u00eat\u00e9es dans le cours de l\u2019exploitation d\u2019une Treasury Branch, m\u00eame si le fait pour la Province de l\u2019exploiter et de faire des pr\u00eats d\u2019argent dans le cours de cette exploitation est hors de sa comp\u00e9tence, en vertu de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique.\nIl est \u00e0 noter que les appelants n\u2019ont pas contest\u00e9 cette assertion. On trouve ce qui suit dans leur factum:\n[TRADUCTION] Il n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9tendu qu\u2019advenant l\u2019annulation des transactions, les appelants pourraient \u00e9viter de rembourser des sommes d\u00fbment vers\u00e9es pour leur compte et \u00e0 leur avantage.\n* * *\nIl est \u00e9vident qu\u2019un emprunteur ne peut frauder son pr\u00eateur sous pr\u00e9texte que celui-ci n\u2019a pas le pouvoir de pr\u00eater. Il n\u2019y a pas de tribunal qui soit impuissant au point de permettre qu\u2019on s\u2019en serve pour frauder un cr\u00e9ancier. Bien que la terminologie ne soit pas encore fix\u00e9e, le principe semble \u00e9vident: c\u2019est tout simplement impossible. La question constitutionnelle est invoqu\u00e9e ici pour faire annuler une convention et faire remettre les parties dans leur situation ant\u00e9rieure, chacune d\u2019elles devant rendre compte \u00e0 l\u2019autre des sommes \u00e0 titre d\u2019argent re\u00e7u.\nLes appelants cherchaient \u00e0 se soustraire seulement au remboursement des sommes que repr\u00e9sentaient les ch\u00e8ques qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le Juge Primrose, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s apr\u00e8s que le paiement en eut \u00e9t\u00e9 contremand\u00e9. Ils refusaient de rembourser ces sommes, non pas parce que la loi \u00e9tait ultra vires mais pour le motif que si une banque paie un ch\u00e8que dont le paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 contremand\u00e9, elle ne peut en recouvrer le montant de son client. Les appelants ne r\u00e9ussissent pas sur ce point parce que, comme l\u2019a conclu \u00e0 juste tire le Juge Primrose, ils ont ratifi\u00e9 le paiement des ch\u00e8ques.\nApr\u00e8s avoir conclu: (1) que The Treasury Branches Act de l\u2019Alberta est ultra vires; (2) que le fait d\u2019exploiter les Treasury Branch ne constitue pas un acte d\u2019exercice de la pr\u00e9rogative royale; (3) qu\u2019ind\u00e9pendamment de l\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9 de la loi, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a droit de recouvrer les sommes qu\u2019elle a pr\u00eat\u00e9es aux appelants, y compris le montant des ch\u00e8ques pay\u00e9s apr\u00e8s contre-ordre, il reste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e et les cons\u00e9quences de la convention du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1958 et des transports en garantie faits en ex\u00e9cution de cette convention. Il y a deux questions \u00e0 d\u00e9cider sous ce rapport: (1) le transport des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e en ex\u00e9cution de la convention du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1958 constituait-il, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s ou de quelques-unes, un paiement partiel \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de la dette des appelants, ou un transport en garantie; (2) quel taux d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat doivent porter les diff\u00e9rentes avances d\u2019argent?\nLe Juge d\u2019appel Allen, exprimant l\u2019opinion majoritaire, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que trois des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s transport\u00e9es en mai 1959 l\u2019avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 en paiement partiel de la dette de l\u2019appelant comme elle existait alors. Je suis d\u2019accord avec cette conclusion. Les termes de la convention du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1958 sont tr\u00e8s clairs sur ce point. Jouissant de sommes d\u2019argent appartenant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, les appelants \u00e9taient oblig\u00e9s de rembourser les sommes que celle-ci leur avait pr\u00eat\u00e9es. Il me para\u00eet certain que ce remboursement pouvait se faire en nature aussi bien qu\u2019en esp\u00e8ces. Le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 aux biens mentionn\u00e9s aux articles nos 4, 5 et 8 \u00e0 la convention du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1958 restera donc \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, libre de tout droit de revendication de la part des appelants ou d\u2019aucun d\u2019eux. Les appelants auront, bien entendu, droit d\u2019\u00eatre cr\u00e9dit\u00e9s de la valeur convenue de ces biens telle qu\u2019indiqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la lettre du 15 mai 1959, soit en tout $12,053.59.\nQuant aux autres propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, soit celles qui d\u2019apr\u00e8s la convention du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1958 de- vaient rester en la possession des appelants et leur \u00eatre lou\u00e9es et, de fait, leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi lou\u00e9es, la minute du jugement de la division d\u2019appel ordonne notamment que celui du Juge de premi\u00e8re instance soit modifi\u00e9 en r\u00e9voquant l\u2019ordonnance de mise en possession des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s suivantes: (a) la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 connue comme \u00abGreen\u2019s Garage Body Shop\u00bb, (b) la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 connue comme \u00abla maison\u00bb, (c) la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 connue comme \u00abla propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Wainwright\u00bb, et en annulant l\u2019ordre de lever les oppositions (caveats) inscrites contre les deux premi\u00e8res. La minute du jugement donne \u00e9galement acte de la convention des parties de surseoir \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du jugement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019issue du pourvoi devant cette Cour et de d\u00e9poser dans un compte en fiducie portant int\u00e9r\u00eat la somme de $25,000 provenant de la vente de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Wainwright pour qu\u2019il en soit dispos\u00e9 comme tenant lieu de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Wainwright. La minute pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement qu\u2019il n\u2019y aura aucune adjudication de d\u00e9pens ni en faveur ni \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019aucune partie.\nAyant trouv\u00e9 que The Treasury Branches Act est ultra vires, je ne puis pas tenir aucun compte de cette conclusion ni du fait lui-m\u00eame. Je suis d\u2019accord avec le Juge d\u2019appel Porter, quand il dit:\n[TRADUCTION] Dans les affaires d\u2019inconstitutionnalit\u00e9, le principe est toujours qu\u2019une personne qui traite avec un corps dont la capacit\u00e9 est limit\u00e9e ne peut faire tourner cette limitation \u00e0 son avantage. La loi ne rend pas la convention ex\u00e9cutoire; elle la consid\u00e8re inexistante et oblige \u00e0 la restitution des sommes ou des biens re\u00e7us parce qu\u2019il serait immoral de permettre \u00e0 la partie avantag\u00e9e de les retenir. Comme la convention est inexistante, la loi emp\u00eache les demandeurs de garder les sommes re\u00e7ues parce qu\u2019elle juge immoral tout acte dont le r\u00e9sultat serait un enrichissement injuste. On pr\u00e9tend cependant que, bien que les demandeurs ne puissent retenir l\u2019argent, la Couronne devrait pouvoir retenir les garanties et ainsi tirer profit et enrichissement d\u2019une transaction qu\u2019en droit elle n\u2019a pas faite. Il est clair que la transaction est nulle \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit et non \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard seulement des justiciables.\nCependant je ne suis pas de son avis et me range plut\u00f4t \u00e0 celui du Juge d\u2019appel Allen pour ce qui est des trois propri\u00e9t\u00e9s transport\u00e9es en paiement partiel et non en garantie, dans le cours du mois de mai 1959. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, si, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, les appelants avaient effectu\u00e9 un paiement en argent de $12,053.59 plut\u00f4t qu\u2019un transport des trois propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, ils ne pourraient d\u2019aucune fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9ter les sommes pay\u00e9es. Je ne vois aucune diff\u00e9rence du fait qu\u2019ils ont effectu\u00e9 le paiement au moyen d\u2019un transport pur et simple des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, pour une valeur fix\u00e9e par entente. \u00c9tant oblig\u00e9s de rembourser, le remboursement est valable m\u00eame si la convention elle-m\u00eame n\u2019a pas d\u2019effet juridique et est nulle en droit.\nDans la reddition de compte qui est ordonn\u00e9e l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat que les appelants auront \u00e0 payer sera calcul\u00e9 aux taux l\u00e9gal de cinq pour cent l\u2019an, sans \u00e9gard au taux stipul\u00e9 dans les billets ou autres effets souscrits par les appelants lorsqu\u2019ils ont re\u00e7u les sommes d\u2019argent. En effet, ce n\u2019est pas en vertu de ces engagements que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a droit \u00e0 ces sommes mais \u00e0 titre d\u2019argent re\u00e7u. Les sommes que les appelants comme emprunteurs, ont en main, par suite de pr\u00eats invalides appartiennent en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui peut les recouvrer non par une action sur contrat ou d\u00e9lit mais par une action en restitution d\u2019argent re\u00e7u: Brooks & Co. v. Blackburn Benefit Society[8].\nIl faudra rendre un compte complet et d\u00e9taill\u00e9 pour \u00e9tablir les sommes que les appelants doivent \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 raison des pr\u00eats qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s de temps \u00e0 autre et qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas encore rembours\u00e9s, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat calcul\u00e9 comme susdit. Dans ce compte, il faudra cr\u00e9diter les appelants de toutes les sommes qu\u2019ils ont vers\u00e9es en vertu des baux avec option d\u2019achat et les d\u00e9biter de toutes les d\u00e9penses faites \u00e0 bon droit par l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour le paiement des taxes, l\u2019entretien et les r\u00e9parations desdites propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat sur toutes ces sommes. L\u2019intim\u00e9e aura jugement contre chacun des appelants s\u00e9par\u00e9ment pour le montant de leur dette respective envers elle, d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par le compte et le calcul des int\u00e9r\u00eats tel qu\u2019ordonn\u00e9 plus haut. Ce compte devra remonter \u00e0 septembre 1956, au moment o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e a pay\u00e9 les ch\u00e8ques qui ont fait l\u2019objet de la contestation et remis l\u2019argent \u00e0 Consolidated. Du fait que la convention du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1958 est nulle, l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne peut retenir les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s transport\u00e9es en garantie en vertu de cette convention. L\u2019intim\u00e9e devra r\u00e9troc\u00e9der ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s (exception faite de \u00abla propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Wainwright\u00bb, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue) \u00e0 celui des appelants qui les lui a remises en mai 1959.\nJ\u2019ai enfin \u00e0 statuer sur la demande des appelants en r\u00e9solution de la convention du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1958. Sur ce point, comme les appelants ont gain de cause dans leur pr\u00e9tention que The Treasury Branches Act est inconstitutionnelle, il s\u2019ensuit que la convention du 8 d\u00e9cembre 1958 n\u2019existe pas en droit: Brougham v. Dwyer (d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9). Cela n\u2019annule pas pour autant les actes r\u00e9ellement accomplis par les appelants, et d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9s, savoir les cessions pures et simples de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour la valeur convenue de $12,053.59. Toutefois, la convention \u00e9tait nulle, les appelants n\u2019ont pas de droit d\u2019action ni en r\u00e9solution ni en dommages. Le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019action en r\u00e9solution et en dommages comme mal fond\u00e9e. Consid\u00e9rant la convention nulle, en droit, je ne vois pas la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tudier ces questions au fond.\nEn cons\u00e9quence, il y aura une d\u00e9claration \u00e0 l\u2019effet que The Treasury Branches Act est ultra vires. Il y aura une reddition de compte, tel que susdit, le taux d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sur les diff\u00e9rentes sommes qu\u2019ont re\u00e7ues les appelants \u00e9tant calcul\u00e9 au taux de cinq pour cent l\u2019an, \u00e0 partir du jour o\u00f9 les diverses sommes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ues par chacun des appelants. L\u2019intim\u00e9e aura jugement pour les sommes qu\u2019\u00e9tablira le compte comme \u00e9tant ce que chacun des appelants, Breckenridge Speedway Limited, Oscar Green et Irene Janet Green, lui doit. Le titre des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s connues comme le \u00abGreen\u2019s Garage Body Shop\u00bb et la \u00abmaison\u00bb sera r\u00e9troc\u00e9d\u00e9 au c\u00e9dant et la somme de $25,000 et int\u00e9r\u00eats accumul\u00e9s, d\u00e9tenue en fiducie pour tenir lieu de \u00abla propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Wainwright\u00bb, sera cr\u00e9dit\u00e9e \u00e0 Breckenridge Speedway Limited dans ledit compte.\nQuant aux d\u00e9pens, les appelants n\u2019ont pas r\u00e9ussi dans leur demande principale, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire de faire d\u00e9duire de leur dette le montant des ch\u00e8ques pay\u00e9s \u00e0 Consolidated qui ont fait l\u2019objet de la contestation, non plus qu\u2019\u00e0 se faire remettre les trois propri\u00e9t\u00e9s donn\u00e9es en paiement partiel. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a perdu son contre-appel. Dans les circonstances ni les appelants, ni l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019auront droit \u00e0 des d\u00e9pens en cette Cour.\nAppel et contre-appel rejet\u00e9s avec d\u00e9pens, les Juges Hall et Spence \u00e9tant partiellement dissidents.\nProcureurs des demandeurs, appelants: Macdonald, Spitz et Lavall\u00e9e, Edmonton.\nProcureurs de la d\u00e9fenderesse, intim\u00e9e: Clement, Irving, Mustard et Rodney, Edmonton.\nProcureur de l\u2019intervenant: Le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada.\n[1] (1967), 61 W.W.R. 257.\n[2] (1881), 19 Ch.D. 64.\n[3] (1961), 106 C.L.R. 318.\n[4] (1871), L.R. 3 P.C. 548.\n[5] (1967), 61 W.W.R. 257.\n[6] (1967), 61 W.W.R. 257 \u00e0 270-279.\n[7] (1913), 108 L.T. 504.\n[8] (1884), 9 App. Cas. 857.",

Le contrat pr\u00e9voyait quatre \u00e9tapes dans la mise en valeur dont la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tait la prospection. S avait le privil\u00e8ge de d\u00e9cider si elle s\u2019engagerait dans la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape, apr\u00e8s avoir termin\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re. Il s\u2019est trouv\u00e9 que, de fait, elle n\u2019a jamais entrepris la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape.\nSelon les termes d\u2019un avenant: 1. S retirait et annulait l\u2019avis o\u00f9 elle avait fait part de son intention de s\u2019engager dans la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de la mise en valeur. 2. DV retirait sa mise en demeure et dispensait S de tous travaux ult\u00e9rieurs pr\u00e9vus au programme \u00e9tabli \u00e0 l\u2019Annexe \u00abF\u00bb du contrat principal. 3. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de mise en valeur \u00e9tait prolong\u00e9e. 4. S convenait d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter les travaux mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019Annexe \u00abA\u00bb des pr\u00e9sentes. 5. Les parties confirmaient les dispositions du contrat principal, sous r\u00e9serve des modifications pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019avenant.\nS a amorc\u00e9 certains travaux pr\u00e9liminaires, mais elle n\u2019a rien fait sur le terrain m\u00eame pour s\u2019acquitter des t\u00e2ches indiqu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019Annexe \u00abA\u00bb. Elle a cess\u00e9 toute activit\u00e9.\nS n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 d\u2019avis pour faire prolonger la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape ni fait conna\u00eetre son intention de s\u2019engager dans la seconde. Les parties ont admis que le contrat avait pris fin et que S avait failli \u00e0 ses obligations contractuelles d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter, comme il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu, les travaux mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019Annexe \u00abA\u00bb. DV a intent\u00e9 contre S une action en dommages pour rupture de contrat. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a accueilli l\u2019action et a accord\u00e9 des dommages, soit la somme de $314,051 pour l\u2019inex\u00e9cution des travaux sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019Annexe \u00abA\u00bb, selon la preuve de ce que co\u00fbterait l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ces travaux. La Cour d\u2019appel, \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9, a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel de S \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de ce jugement et elle a accueilli l\u2019appel incident de DV qui demandait des dommages plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s, en lui accordant un suppl\u00e9ment de $64,976. L\u2019appel devant cette Cour porte seulement sur le montant des dommages.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLa plaidoirie de l\u2019avocat de S n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 convaincre cette Cour que, dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, les tribunaux ont fait erreur en accordant \u00e0 DV des dommages \u00e9quivalant aux d\u00e9penses \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019Annexe \u00abA\u00bb, que S s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e \u00e0 effectuer et qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment omis d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter. La pr\u00e9tention que DV n\u2019\u00e9tait en droit de recevoir, \u00e0 titre de dommages, que la diff\u00e9rence entre la valeur que les terrains auraient eue si les travaux avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, et leur valeur sans ces travaux, et qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune preuve qui permettait d\u2019\u00e9tablir un dommage sur cette base, n\u2019est pas un juste crit\u00e8re pour fixer les dommages.\nIl est impossible de chercher \u00e0 comparer la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mini\u00e8re transform\u00e9e par l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux avec la valeur de cette m\u00eame propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sans ces travaux. Le r\u00e9sultat des travaux d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019Annexe \u00abA\u00bb n\u2019est pas connu, et il en est ainsi du fait que S a choisi de rompre le contrat sign\u00e9 pour leur ex\u00e9cution. Mais, alors que, d\u2019une part, S, par son adh\u00e9sion au contrat, a reconnu que son propre programme de travail valait bien le co\u00fbt de son ex\u00e9cution, vu les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices possibles qu\u2019elle pouvait retirer du contrat et que, d\u2019autre part, DV \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 verser, et a effectivement vers\u00e9, une contrepartie appr\u00e9ciable pour la r\u00e9alisation de ce programme, il \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait judicieux de la part du juge de premi\u00e8re instance d\u2019\u00e9valuer le dommage r\u00e9sultant de la rupture du contrat \u00e0 un montant \u00e9quivalent au co\u00fbt de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux.\nLe droit aux dommages d\u00e9termin\u00e9s de cette mani\u00e8re ne se trouve pas modifi\u00e9 par le fait que DV a conclu avec une autre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 un contrat pour la mise en valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mini\u00e8re, qui n\u2019est devenu ex\u00e9cutoire qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019institution par DV d\u2019une action en dommages contre S, et l\u2019audition de la cause.

Les parties admettent la rupture du contrat et la seule question \u00e0 trancher en cette Cour est celle du montant des dommages.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e, ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9e \u00abDolly Varden\u00bb, a, le 4 mars 1964, pass\u00e9 un contrat portant la date formelle du 1er f\u00e9vrier 1964, avec l\u2019appelante, Sunshine Exploration Ltd., une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019Alberta enregistr\u00e9e en Colombie-Britannique. Cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est une filiale \u00e0 100 p. 100 de la Sunshine Mining Company, constitu\u00e9e dans l\u2019\u00c9tat d\u2019Idaho, qui ne pouvait pas se faire immatriculer en Colombie-Britannique parce que son nom ressemblait \u00e0 celui d\u2019une autre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui y \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 immatricul\u00e9e. Pour cette raison, c\u2019est la filiale qui a sign\u00e9 le contrat, mais il \u00e9tait convenu entre la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00e8re et Dolly Varden, de m\u00eame qu\u2019entre la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00e8re et la filiale, que celle-ci agissait \u00e0 titre d\u2019agent de la premi\u00e8re pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux miniers qu\u2019elle s\u2019engageait \u00e0 faire en vertu du contrat et que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00e8re serait tenue envers Dolly Varden aux m\u00eames obligations que si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 partie au contrat.\nAux fins du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, la situation juridique des deux appelantes est la m\u00eame et je les d\u00e9signerai toutes deux sous le nom de \u00abSun- shine\u00bb, comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une seule et m\u00eame partie au contrat.\nSelon les termes de ce contrat, Dolly Varden accordait \u00e0 Sunshine le droit exclusif de faire la prospection et l\u2019exploitation de certaines de ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mini\u00e8res, situ\u00e9es en Colombie\u2011Britannique et d\u00e9sign\u00e9es dans la convention, le tout aux frais de Sunshine. Le contrat pr\u00e9voyait quatre \u00e9tapes dans la mise en valeur. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape, la prospection, devait permettre \u00e0 Sunshine de d\u00e9terminer quels travaux miniers elle pourrait effectuer \u00e0 des stades ult\u00e9rieurs. La deuxi\u00e8me comportait d\u2019autres travaux de prospection et devait aboutir \u00e0 l\u2019exploitation commerciale. La troisi\u00e8me phase devait permettre \u00e0 chacune des parties de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer leur mise de fonds respective \u00e0 m\u00eame la production. Durant la quatri\u00e8me \u00e9tape, d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme la dur\u00e9e suppl\u00e9mentaire de validit\u00e9 du contrat (soit 50 ans au maximum), il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu que les parties diviseraient \u00e9galement les profits tir\u00e9s de l\u2019exploitation.\nSunshine avait le privil\u00e8ge de d\u00e9cider si elle s\u2019engageait dans la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape, apr\u00e8s avoir termin\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re. Il s\u2019est trouv\u00e9 que, de fait, elle n\u2019a jamais entrepris la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape.\nDolly Varden avait convenu, au moment de la signature du contrat, de c\u00e9der \u00e0 Sunshine la moiti\u00e9 des int\u00e9r\u00eats qu\u2019elle poss\u00e9dait dans les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mini\u00e8res d\u00e9sign\u00e9es dans la convention. Sunshine \u00e9tait d\u2019accord pour remettre \u00e0 un d\u00e9positaire public toutes les pi\u00e8ces constatant la r\u00e9trocession compl\u00e8te \u00e0 Dolly Varden de cette moiti\u00e9 des int\u00e9r\u00eats, lequel d\u00e9positaire devait remettre ces pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 Dolly Varden si Sunshine mettait fin au contrat ou n\u00e9gligeait de signifier son intention de s\u2019engager dans la deuxi\u00e8me phase des travaux. De fait, on a remis ces pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 Dolly Varden.\nLa premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de mise en valeur se d\u00e9finissait comme suit:\n[TRADUCTION] La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape ou p\u00e9riode de mise en valeur signifie la p\u00e9riode commen\u00e7ant le jour de la signature du pr\u00e9sent contrat et se terminant le 31 d\u00e9cembre 1964, \u00e0 moins que l\u2019entrepreneur (Sunshine) n\u2019avise par \u00e9crit la compagnie (Dolly Varden), avant le 30 novembre 1964, de son intention de prolonger la premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode de mise en valeur, auquel cas cette derni\u00e8re se prolongera jusqu\u2019au 30 juin 1965. Sunshine s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e aux conditions qui suivent, quant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de mise en valeur:\n[TRADUCTION] 6.

Sunshine devait tenir \u00e0 jour des dossiers complets et des registres d\u00e9taill\u00e9s des lev\u00e9s, des plans et des analyses, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 tenir Dolly Varden parfaitement renseign\u00e9e sur la nature et les caract\u00e9ristiques des travaux miniers et de leur ex\u00e9cution.\nSunshine a fait du forage de mars \u00e0 octobre 1964, auquel elle a consacr\u00e9 quelque $348,000. Cependant, Dolly Varden \u00e9tait insatisfaite des travaux parce que, disait-elle, Sunshine ne lui avait pas fourni d\u2019\u00e9tats r\u00e9guliers des d\u00e9penses et des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s et qu\u2019elle avait sensiblement chang\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9tendue du programme de forage.\nLe 30 novembre 1964, Dolly Varden a re\u00e7u un avis o\u00f9 Sunshine lui indiquait qu\u2019elle avait l\u2019intention de s\u2019engager dans la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de la mise en valeur. Le 14 janvier 1965, Dolly Varden avisait Sunshine qu\u2019elle lui reprochait d\u2019avoir manqu\u00e9 aux obligations du contrat, et ce sous plusieurs chefs qui \u00e9taient \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s.\nLes administrateurs de Dolly Varden et ceux de Sunshine se sont r\u00e9unis \u00e0 diverses reprises, par la suite. Ils se sont finalement mis d\u2019accord pour signer un avenant, en date formelle du 22 janvier 1965. Selon les termes de cet avenant:\n1. Sunshine retirait et annulait l\u2019avis o\u00f9 elle avait fait part de son intention de s\u2019engager dans la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de la mise en valeur.\n2. Dolly Varden retirait sa mise en demeure et dispensait Sunshine de tous travaux ult\u00e9rieurs pr\u00e9vus au programme \u00e9tabli \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abF\u00bb du contrat principal.\n3. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de mise en valeur \u00e9tait prolong\u00e9e jusqu\u2019au 30 septembre 1965, et Sunshine recevait le privil\u00e8ge de l\u2019\u00e9tendre jusqu\u2019au 31 d\u00e9cembre 1966, pourvu qu\u2019elle en avise l\u2019autre partie avant le 31 ao\u00fbt 1965.\n4. Sunshine convenait de plus:\n[TRADUCTION] Nonobstant toute disposition des pr\u00e9sentes relative \u00e0 la cl\u00f4ture de ladite premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape, l\u2019Entrepreneur ex\u00e9cutera les travaux mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb des pr\u00e9sentes pendant la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de mise en valeur, avant le 1er octobre 1965. Apr\u00e8s avoir commenc\u00e9 les travaux mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb des pr\u00e9sentes, l\u2019Entrepreneur les poursuivra sans interruption; le forage et la mise en valeur desdites propri\u00e9t\u00e9s devront se poursuivre pendant toute la dur\u00e9e des travaux mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb des pr\u00e9sentes. Advenant que les travaux mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb des pr\u00e9sentes ne soient pas termin\u00e9s avant le 1er octobre 1965, la Compagnie se r\u00e9serve le droit de mettre fin au contrat principal en donnant un avis \u00e9crit \u00e0 cet effet \u00e0 l\u2019Entrepreneur. Le fait pour la Compagnie de donner un tel avis mettra fin au contrat principal, sous r\u00e9serve cependant que l\u2019Entrepreneur continuera d\u2019\u00eatre tenu aux obligations relatives \u00e0 la r\u00e9siliation du contrat, stipul\u00e9es \u00e0 la clause n\u00b0 15 du contrat principal. Il est toutefois entendu que la r\u00e9siliation ci-dessus pr\u00e9vue du contrat ne soustraira pas l\u2019Entrepreneur \u00e0 l\u2019obligation de parfaire les travaux mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb.\n5. Les parties confirmaient les dispositions du contrat principal, sous r\u00e9serve des modifications pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019avenant.\nL\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb de l\u2019avenant pr\u00e9voyait l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019un programme convenu de forage au diamant et d\u2019ass\u00e8chement de la mine Torbrit (une des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mini\u00e8res d\u00e9sign\u00e9es au contrat principal), l\u2019\u00e9tude de la profondeur du gisement de la mine Torbrit, la d\u00e9termination par forage au diamant de la largeur du gisement dans la partie est de la mine Torbrit, l\u2019ach\u00e8vement d\u2019environ 5,000 pieds de forage au diamant dans la mine Wolf (une autre propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mini\u00e8re d\u00e9sign\u00e9e au contrat principal), le parach\u00e8vement d\u2019environ 500 pieds de forage au diamant dans les \u00abclaims\u00bb Sussex (autre propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mini\u00e8re d\u00e9sign\u00e9e au contrat principal).\nSunshine a amorc\u00e9 certains travaux pr\u00e9liminaires, mais elle n\u2019a rien fait sur le terrain m\u00eame pour s\u2019acquitter des t\u00e2ches indiqu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb. Elle a cess\u00e9 toute activit\u00e9.\nSelon les termes du contrat principal, tel que modifi\u00e9, la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de mise en valeur devait se terminer le 30 septembre 1965, \u00e0 moins que Sunshine ne prolonge cette phase en donnant avis avant le 31 ao\u00fbt 1965 ou \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle ne signifie son intention, avant cette derni\u00e8re date, de s\u2019engager dans la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de mise en valeur. Sunshine n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 d\u2019avis pour faire prolonger la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape ni fait conna\u00eetre son intention de s\u2019engager dans la seconde.\nLes parties ont admis, dans leur argumentation devant cette Cour, que le contrat avait pris fin et que Sunshine avait failli \u00e0 ses obligations contractuelles d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter, comme il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu, les travaux mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb.\nDolly Varden a intent\u00e9 contre Sunshine une action en dommages pour rupture de contrat. Le proc\u00e8s a dur\u00e9 du 30 janvier au 17 f\u00e9vrier 1967, inclusivement. On a ensuite produit des pi\u00e8ces suppl\u00e9mentaires et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des plaidoiries sur les cons\u00e9quences d\u2019un contrat entr\u00e9 en vigueur le 9 mars 1967 entre Dolly Varden et Newmont Mining Corporation of Canada Limited (ci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9sign\u00e9e sous le nom de \u00abNewmont\u00bb).\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, ce contrat stipulait que Dolly Varden remettrait \u00e0 Newmont la possession, la gestion et l\u2019administration exclusives de ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mini\u00e8res pour y proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des travaux de forage, de prospection et de mise en valeur. Newmont s\u2019engageait \u00e0 faire une \u00e9tude g\u00e9ologique du terrain, comme elle le voudrait, et une \u00e9tude g\u00e9ophysique, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 elle jugerait bon de le faire. Ces \u00e9tudes devaient \u00eatre achev\u00e9es le 31 d\u00e9cembre 1967. Si elle parachevait ces travaux tel que convenu, Newmont pouvait soit mettre fin au contrat, soit le prolonger d\u2019une ann\u00e9e, mais en ce cas, elle serait tenue de d\u00e9penser au moins $200,000 pour la mise en valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Le contrat pr\u00e9voyait deux autres p\u00e9riodes de prolongation d\u2019un an, au gr\u00e9 de Newmont, assorties de d\u00e9penses annuelles d\u2019au moins $300,000. Apr\u00e8s quoi, Newmont pouvait soit r\u00e9silier le contrat, soit am\u00e9nager la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour l\u2019exploitation mini\u00e8re. Dans ce dernier cas, elle en deviendrait propri\u00e9taire mais pour le compte des deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s. Les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices d\u2019exploitation se diviseraient \u00e0 parts \u00e9gales, apr\u00e8s remboursement \u00e0 chacune des parties de ses d\u00e9penses. Newmont ne s\u2019engageait pas \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter les travaux mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb de l\u2019avenant du contrat entre Sunshine et Dolly Varden.\nLe savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance a accord\u00e9 des dommages pour rupture de contrat, soit la somme de $314,051 pour inex\u00e9cution des travaux sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb, selon la preuve de ce que co\u00fbterait l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ces travaux.\nLa Cour d\u2019appel[2], \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9, a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel de Sunshine \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de ce jugement et elle a accueilli l\u2019appel incident de Dolly Varden qui demandait des dommages plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s, en lui accordant un suppl\u00e9ment de $64,976.\nLe pourvoi devant cette Cour porte seulement sur le montant des dommages, l\u2019appelante soutenant que Dolly Varden n\u2019a subi ni prouv\u00e9 aucun dommage du fait de l\u2019inex\u00e9cution des travaux sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb et que c\u2019\u00e9tait une erreur de droit que d\u2019adjuger une somme \u00e9gale au co\u00fbt d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ces travaux. Le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu, en fait:\n[TRADUCTION] Je suis d\u2019avis que le parach\u00e8vement des travaux mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb constituait une \u00e9tape n\u00e9cessaire et justifi\u00e9e en termes \u00e9conomiques dans la mise en valeur de la mine Torbrit.\nVu cette conclusion, et une autre \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les administrateurs de Dolly Varden entendaient faire achever les travaux mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb, le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il fallait d\u00e9terminer le montant des dommages selon les crit\u00e8res que cette Cour a approuv\u00e9s dans l\u2019affaire Cunningham c. Insinger[3]. Il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 d\u2019une affaire o\u00f9 le propri\u00e9taire d\u2019une mine avait accord\u00e9 \u00e0 un concessionnaire une option d\u2019achat \u00e0 prix fixe payable par versements. A l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du premier versement, le concessionnaire sollicita une prorogation de d\u00e9lai. Le propri\u00e9taire y consentit \u00e0 condition que le concessionnaire s\u2019engage\u00e2t \u00e0 faire certains travaux d\u2019am\u00e9nagement non pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019option d\u2019achat. Ces travaux consistaient surtout \u00e0 percer un certain nombre de galeries. Le concessionnaire ayant n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de payer, abandonn\u00e9 la possession de la mine et renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019option d\u2019achat sans avoir ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 les travaux, le propri\u00e9taire en a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 le co\u00fbt \u00e0 titre de dommages et cette Cour a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait droit, le Juge Idington \u00e9tant dissident. L\u2019avocat du concessionnaire, Me Lafleur, avait soutenu que le propri\u00e9taire ne pouvait recouvrer que l\u2019avantage p\u00e9cuniaire qu\u2019il aurait retir\u00e9 de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, dans ce cas, la plus-value donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la mine par suite des travaux.\nLe Juge Duff, alors juge pu\u00een\u00e9, dit \u00e0 la page 14:\n[TRADUCTION] Il ne serait pas prudent, je pense, d\u2019essayer de poser un principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur la fa\u00e7on de fixer les dommages que peut recouvrer un propri\u00e9taire de mine quand le d\u00e9tenteur d\u2019une option d\u2019achat manque \u00e0 son engagement d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter des travaux d\u2019am\u00e9nagement ou de prospection. Il y aura sans doute des cas o\u00f9 le crit\u00e8re invoqu\u00e9 par Me Lafleur dans son plaidoyer sera le seul crit\u00e8re qui s\u2019impose. Quelles que soient alors les difficult\u00e9s et les complications auxquelles la recherche des faits donnera lieu, il sera du devoir de la Cour de d\u00e9terminer la plus-value que les travaux auraient donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. D\u2019autre part, il doit y avoir des cas o\u00f9 le demandeur a un droit strict de recouvrer au moins le co\u00fbt des travaux. S\u2019il \u00e9tait clairement \u00e9tabli, par exemple, que les travaux \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter constituent une partie, une partie essentielle, d\u2019un programme de prospection ou d\u2019am\u00e9nagement indispensable, d\u2019apr\u00e8s un sp\u00e9cialiste, \u00e0 l\u2019exploitation de la mine et n\u00e9cessaire, d\u2019apr\u00e8s des administrateurs s\u00e9rieux, de sorte qu\u2019on devrait raisonnablement pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019advenant l\u2019abandon de l\u2019option, le propri\u00e9taire ferait normalement parachever les travaux, les dommages normaux comprendraient alors le co\u00fbt d\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux et seraient donc recouvrables en droit.\nLe Juge Anglin, alors juge pu\u00een\u00e9, dit \u00e0 la page 16:\n[TRADUCTION] Sur la recommandation de M.M.S. Davys, ing\u00e9nieur des mines, le demandeur a exig\u00e9 que M. Cunningham promette de commencer les travaux imm\u00e9diatement et de les poursuivre sans interruption, avant de lui accorder une prorogation de d\u00e9lai. M. Davys a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Moore et lui \u00e9taient d\u2019accord que les travaux en cause \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires. Le demandeur s\u2019en est remis \u00e0 M. Davys, et on a raison d\u2019en conclure que non seulement il consid\u00e8re ces travaux comme essentiels, mais aussi qu\u2019il les fera ex\u00e9cuter. C\u2019est la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle il faut en venir pour expliquer pourquoi le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance \u00e0 d\u00e9rog\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle ordinaire voulant que le montant des dommages, quand le d\u00e9fendeur omet d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter certains travaux qu\u2019il s\u2019est oblig\u00e9 par contrat \u00e0 faire sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur, s\u2019\u00e9tablisse selon la perte p\u00e9cuniaire r\u00e9elle que subit le demandeur par suite de ce d\u00e9faut, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la diff\u00e9rence entre la valeur qu\u2019aurait eue la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 si le d\u00e9fendeur avait rempli son obligation et la valeur de celle-ci sans l\u2019addition de ces travaux. La question n\u2019est pas sans difficult\u00e9s et, en cette affaire, c\u2019est uniquement parce que je crois que le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance en a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 selon le crit\u00e8re que je viens d\u2019indiquer, ce que la preuve lui permettait de faire, que j\u2019accepte sa d\u00e9termination des dommages.\nOn peut consulter: Pell v.

Dans la derni\u00e8re affaire cit\u00e9e, la Cour d\u2019appel a jug\u00e9 que la violation par un locataire de son engagement de remettre les lieux en bon \u00e9tat donne lieu \u00e0 l\u2019application d\u2019une r\u00e8gle commode r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement suivie depuis longtemps, sp\u00e9cialement dans les affaires de ce genre, et \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 une r\u00e8gle de droit selon laquelle l\u2019\u00e9tendue des dommages subis par le bailleur est \u00e9gale au co\u00fbt des r\u00e9parations qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faites. On peut \u00e9galement relever un arr\u00eat r\u00e9cent de la Chambre d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario: M.J. O\u2019Brien Ltd. v. Freedman, (1923) 25 O.W.N. 240.\nLe Juge Mignault dit \u00e0 la page 17:\n[TRADUCTION] A mon avis, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du contrat que les parties ont conclu par l\u2019\u00e9change de trois lettres dat\u00e9es du 19 octobre, du 26 octobre et du 2 novembre 1918, l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux d\u2019am\u00e9nagement mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe 3 de la lettre de l\u2019appelant, en date du 19 octobre, constituait la compensation pour la prorogation, consentie par l\u2019intim\u00e9, du d\u00e9lai de paiement du solde du premier versement pr\u00e9vu dans le contrat \u00e0 option conclu par les parties. Il ne s\u2019agissait aucunement d\u2019une condition de l\u2019option originale qui devenait inop\u00e9rante si l\u2019appelant n\u2019exer\u00e7ait pas son option d\u2019achat. Au contraire, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019avait int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 stipuler ces travaux d\u2019am\u00e9nagement que pour le cas o\u00f9 l\u2019appelant renoncerait \u00e0 exercer son option. Si ce dernier avait achet\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et en avait pay\u00e9 le prix, l\u2019\u00e9tendue des travaux d\u2019am\u00e9nagement aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 sans importance pour l\u2019intim\u00e9. De plus, la lettre indiquait que les travaux devaient commencer imm\u00e9diatement.\nL\u2019avocat de Sunshine pr\u00e9tend que le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance aurait d\u00fb suivre l\u2019arr\u00eat de cette Cour dans l\u2019affaire Cotter c. General Petroleums Limited[4], et n\u2019aurait d\u00fb accorder que des dommages symboliques.\nDans cette affaire-l\u00e0, Cotter avait accord\u00e9 \u00e0 General Petroleums Limited et \u00e0 Superior Oils, Limited une option sur le p\u00e9trole et le gaz naturel que renfermaient certains terrains qu\u2019il d\u00e9tenait en vertu d\u2019un bail. La clause n\u00b0 2 du contrat stipulait que l\u2019option devait s\u2019exercer avant telle date, en commen\u00e7ant le forage d\u2019un puits sur les terrains en question et en avisant Cotter de ce fait. En vertu de la clause n\u00b0 3, les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s s\u2019\u00e9taient engag\u00e9es \u00e0 exercer l\u2019option dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 \u00e0 la clause n\u00b0 2. Il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu que, si elles n\u2019exer\u00e7aient pas ce droit, Cotter, m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019il serait p\u00e9rim\u00e9, aurait un recours en justice pour le d\u00e9faut des preneurs de remplir leur engagement qui, de l\u2019avis m\u00eame des parties, constituait une consid\u00e9ration importante de l\u2019octroi de l\u2019option. Les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s n\u2019ayant pas tenu leur engagement, Cotter a intent\u00e9 une action en dommages contre elles. En premi\u00e8re instance, on lui a accord\u00e9 une somme \u00e9gale au co\u00fbt du forage d\u2019un puits. En appel, la Chambre d\u2019appel de la Cour supr\u00eame de l\u2019Alberta a jug\u00e9 que la clause n\u00b0 3 \u00e9tait nulle parce qu\u2019inconciliable avec l\u2019ensemble du contrat et \u00e0 rejeter du fait qu\u2019elle en d\u00e9truisait l\u2019objet. En cette Cour, le Juge Locke s\u2019est rang\u00e9 \u00e0 cet avis.\nLe Juge en chef Rinfret et le Juge Kerwin, alors pu\u00een\u00e9, tout en ne partageant pas cette opinion, ont conclu que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ne s\u2019\u00e9taient pas engag\u00e9es \u00e0 forer un puits. Le Juge Kerwin, qui a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 les motifs de cette d\u00e9cision, dit \u00e0 la page 159:\n[TRADUCTION] Le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance s\u2019est fond\u00e9, pour accueillir l\u2019action, sur l\u2019ensemble du bail principal, du contrat en litige et du projet de bail qui l\u2019accompagne, en interpr\u00e9tant comme une obligation de forer un puits l\u2019engagement sur lequel la poursuite est fond\u00e9e. Je ne puis admettre que ce soit la bonne fa\u00e7on d\u2019aborder la question. La clause n\u00b0 4 du contrat stipule que celui qui donne l\u2019option devra sous-louer aux preneurs \u00abs\u2019ils exercent leur option\u00bb. Je ne peux voir dans ce contrat un simple bail. Ce ne serait le cas que si les preneurs avaient de fait exerc\u00e9 leur option. Il me semble qu\u2019on a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 la clause n\u00b0 3 en pr\u00e9voyant que les preneurs pouvaient ne pas exercer leur option et que, s\u2019ils n\u00e9gligeaient de le faire, cela pourrait entra\u00eener certaines cons\u00e9quences. Le bail ne devait intervenir que si les preneurs exer\u00e7aient leur option.\nL\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa cause comme si l\u2019engagement des intim\u00e9es \u00e9tait de forer un puits, ce qui, \u00e0 mon sens, n\u2019est pas l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qu\u2019on doit lui donner, mais il a quand m\u00eame droit \u00e0 plus que des dommages symboliques.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, il y a eu engagement formel d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter les travaux mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb et manquement manifeste \u00e0 cet engagement.\nLe Juge Cartwright, alors juge pu\u00een\u00e9, et le Juge Fauteux qui souscrivait aux m\u00eames motifs, ont conclu que les clauses nos 2 et 3 n\u2019\u00e9taient pas inconciliables et que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s s\u2019\u00e9taient engag\u00e9es \u00e0 forer un puits. Le Juge Cartwright dit \u00e0 la page 172:\n[TRADUCTION] Je crois que, pris dans son ensemble, le contrat du 21 avril 1948 et ses annexes indiquent que les parties ont convenu qu\u2019au plus tard le 1er ao\u00fbt 1948 les intim\u00e9es commenceraient \u00e0 forer un puits de la fa\u00e7on d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 la clause n\u00b0 2 du contrat, que, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de ces travaux, les parties signeraient le sous-bail et que les intim\u00e9es parach\u00e8veraient le forage de la mani\u00e8re indiqu\u00e9e audit sous-bail. Je crois que les intim\u00e9es s\u2019\u00e9taient engag\u00e9es par le contrat non seulement \u00e0 commencer mais \u00e0 terminer le forage du puits dans les d\u00e9lais et suivant les modalit\u00e9s convenus, et que cette obligation les liait depuis la signature du contrat du 21 avril 1948.\nIl conclut ensuite que, dans les circonstances, Cotter n\u2019avait pas le droit de recouvrer pour la violation de l\u2019engagement de forer un puits, le co\u00fbt du forage. Son raisonnement est le suivant (page 174):\n[TRADUCTION] Il reste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer d\u2019apr\u00e8s quel principe et \u00e0 quel montant il faut fixer les dommages.\nLord Atkinson a expos\u00e9 le principe fondamental dans l\u2019affaire Wertheim v. Chicoutimi Pulp Co. [1911] A.C. 301 \u00e0 la p. 307: \u00abEt la loi vise g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, en accordant des dommages pour rupture de contrat, \u00e0 mettre le demandeur, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela peut se faire par l\u2019allocation d\u2019une somme d\u2019argent, dans l\u2019\u00e9tat o\u00f9 il se serait trouv\u00e9 si le contrat avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9\u2026 C\u2019est le principe fondamental. C\u2019est un principe juste.\u00bb Si, dans l\u2019affaire qui est pr\u00e9sentement devant nous, les intim\u00e9es avaient rempli leurs obligations, l\u2019appelant n\u2019aurait pas eu \u00e0 payer une somme de $1,000 au bailleur principal pour obtenir six mois de prolongation. Les parties savaient qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de faire ce paiement, et je suis d\u2019accord avec le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance que cette somme est recouvrable. Quels autres avantages aurait retir\u00e9s l\u2019appelant de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat? Si les intim\u00e9es avaient for\u00e9 le puits \u00e0 la profondeur indiqu\u00e9e et celui-ci avait \u00e9t\u00e9 productif, l\u2019appelant aurait b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9: (a) de sa part de la production et, (b) de l\u2019avantage de voir le bail principal confirm\u00e9 par l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019obligation du locataire de forer un puits et ce, non seulement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des 80 acres d\u00e9crits dans le sous-bail, mais \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des 160 acres qui faisaient l\u2019objet du bail principal. D\u2019autre part, si, comme il est beaucoup plus probable, selon le t\u00e9moignage des g\u00e9ologues, le puits s\u2019\u00e9tait av\u00e9r\u00e9 improductif, l\u2019appelant n\u2019aurait pas joui de l\u2019avantage d\u00e9sign\u00e9 sous (a), mais il aurait quand m\u00eame profit\u00e9 de celui d\u00e9sign\u00e9 sous (b). On doit aussi retenir que, par suite du d\u00e9sistement des intim\u00e9es, l\u2019appelant dispose des 160 acres de terrain libres de tous droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des intim\u00e9es. Celles-ci n\u2019ont rien re\u00e7u de ce qu\u2019elles devaient toucher en vertu du contrat, sauf que, du 21 avril 1948 jusque vers juin 1948, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 elles ont d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 le contrat, elles poss\u00e9daient les 80 acres de terrain et l\u2019appelant ne pouvait en disposer. Dans ces conditions, je ne crois pas que le co\u00fbt du forage corresponde vraiment au montant des dommages. Supposons qu\u2019au lieu de ce qui est stipul\u00e9 dans le contrat l\u2019appelant se soit engag\u00e9 \u00e0 payer $53,500 pour le forage d\u2019un puits, et qu\u2019avant m\u00eame de commencer les travaux et d\u2019avoir re\u00e7u aucun paiement les intim\u00e9es aient refus\u00e9 d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter le contrat. Dans un cas comme celui-l\u00e0, par analogie avec la r\u00e8gle suivie dans les contrats de construction, le montant des dommages serait sans doute la diff\u00e9rence qu\u2019il pourrait y avoir entre le prix convenu pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux et la somme que l\u2019appelant a effectivement d\u00e9bours\u00e9e pour les faire terminer. Je crois que les affaires o\u00f9 l\u2019on a jug\u00e9 que le co\u00fbt du forage \u00e9quivaut au montant des dommages sont celles o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait re\u00e7u de fait la prestation pr\u00e9vue pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux. Telles sont les affaires Cunningham c. Insinger, [1924] R.C.S. 8; et Pell v. Shearman, (1855) 10 Ex. 766 (contrat de forage d\u2019un puits de mine).\nDes passages ci-haut cit\u00e9s, il faut conclure que l\u2019obligation incombant aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de forer un puits, par opposition \u00e0 celle de commencer \u00e0 en forer un, aurait pris naissance seulement si elles avaient exerc\u00e9 leur option et un sous-bail leur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti. Le forage devait avoir pour contrepartie l\u2019octroi d\u2019un sous-bail, et cela ne leur avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la contrepartie pr\u00e9vue pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 totalement fournie \u00e0 Sunshine. En vertu du contrat principal, la moiti\u00e9 des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mini\u00e8res lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9e. En ex\u00e9cution des dispositions de l\u2019avenant, elle a re\u00e7u de Dolly Varden la contrepartie pr\u00e9vue, savoir le retrait de la mise en demeure, la renonciation \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du reste des travaux d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abF\u00bb du contrat principal, la d\u00e9charge de tout manquement ant\u00e9rieur, et une prolongation du terme de la premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode de mise en valeur. En contrepartie, Sunshine a pris l\u2019engagement ferme d\u2019accomplir les travaux d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb, qu\u2019elle a manqu\u00e9 et refus\u00e9 d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter. Pour ces raisons, je consid\u00e8re que les motifs de l\u2019affaire Cotter ne peuvent \u00eatre, dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, d\u2019aucun secours \u00e0 Sunshine.\nLe Juge en Chef Davey de la Cour d\u2019appel est d\u2019accord avec le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance pour admettre que Dolly Varden \u00e9tait en droit de recevoir le montant des d\u00e9penses \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb. Il arrive \u00e0 cette conclusion pour les motifs quelque peu diff\u00e9rents de ceux du juge de premi\u00e8re instance. Il signale que l\u2019opinion du Juge Duff, dans l\u2019affaire Cunningham, selon laquelle il serait imprudent d\u2019essayer de poser un principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur la fa\u00e7on de fixer les dommages subis par un propri\u00e9taire de mine par suite de l\u2019inex\u00e9cution d\u2019un contrat de prospection et d\u2019am\u00e9nagement, repose sur des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents importants, et il cite les suivants:\nDans l\u2019affaire Wertheim v. Chicoutimi Pulp Company, [1911] A.C. 301, cit\u00e9e dans Cunningham c. Insinger et Cotter c. General Petroleums Ltd., Lord Atkinson d\u00e9clare \u00e0 la page 307:\n[TRADUCTION] Et la loi vise g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, en accordant des dommages pour rupture de contrat, \u00e0 mettre le demandeur, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela peut se faire par l\u2019allocation d\u2019une somme d\u2019argent, dans l\u2019\u00e9tat o\u00f9 il se serait trouv\u00e9 si le contrat avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9: Irvine v. Midland Ry. Co. (Ireland), (1880) 6 L.R.Ir. \u00e0 la page 63, suivi par le Baron en chef Palles dans Hamilton v. Magill, (1883) 12 L.R.Ir. \u00e0 la page 202. C\u2019est le principe fondamental. C\u2019est un principe juste. La r\u00e8gle qui veut qu\u2019on s\u2019en rapporte, pour l\u2019\u00e9valuation des dommages, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cart dans le prix du march\u00e9 aux p\u00e9riodes respectives sus-indiqu\u00e9es, a tout simplement pour but d\u2019appliquer ce principe, et, ainsi qu\u2019on l\u2019\u00e9nonce dans une des affaires am\u00e9ricaines cit\u00e9es, elle assure g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement l\u2019indemnisation totale de l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur. Cependant elle se propose uniquement d\u2019assurer l\u2019indemnisation. La valeur marchande est prise en consid\u00e9ration parce qu\u2019elle est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e repr\u00e9senter, aux yeux de l\u2019acheteur, la v\u00e9ritable valeur de la marchandise. En cas de d\u00e9faut de livraison, lorsque l\u2019acheteur n\u2019obtient pas la marchandise achet\u00e9e, on suppose que la valeur de celle-ci, s\u2019il l\u2019avait re\u00e7ue, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9gale \u00e0 sa valeur marchande, et que, s\u2019il avait voulu la remplacer par une autre, il aurait pu l\u2019obtenir \u00e0 ce prix sur le march\u00e9. Dans l\u2019affaire British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company Limited v. Underground Electric Railways Company of London, Limited [1912] A.C. 673, Lord Haldane dit aux pages 688 et 689:\n[TRADUCTION] En vue d\u2019arriver \u00e0 une conclusion sur la question des dommages ainsi soulev\u00e9e, il est essentiel de garder pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 l\u2019esprit certains principes qui, je le pense, sont bien \u00e9tablis. Dans certaines affaires, on rel\u00e8ve des \u00e9nonc\u00e9s de principes r\u00e9gissant l\u2019\u00e9valuation des dommages qui semblent, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, difficilement conciliables. Toutefois, ces divergences apparentes tiennent principalement \u00e0 la nature diverse des questions particuli\u00e8res \u00e0 trancher. Le montant des dommages est une question de fait, et la seule indication que la loi peut donner consiste \u00e0 formuler des principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux qui parfois ne sont pas tr\u00e8s utiles quand il s\u2019agit de traiter de cas particuliers. Les juges qui, dans ces cas, donnent des directives \u00e0 des jur\u00e9s doivent tenir compte de leur caract\u00e8re particulier, et adapter aux diff\u00e9rentes cat\u00e9gories de demandes leur \u00e9nonc\u00e9 des principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux applicables, et cela peut cr\u00e9er use ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 apparente.\nCeci dit, je pense qu\u2019il y a certains principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux qui sont bien \u00e9tablis. Le premier consiste, dans la mesure du possible, \u00e0 remettre celui qui a prouv\u00e9 la rupture de contrat, savoir l\u2019inex\u00e9cution d\u2019un march\u00e9 par lequel il devait obtenir quelque chose, dans une situation aussi avantageuse, pour autant que cela puisse se faire par l\u2019allocation d\u2019une somme d\u2019argent, que si le contrat avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9.\nLe principe fondamental est donc la compensation des pertes p\u00e9cuniaires d\u00e9coulant naturellement de l\u2019inex\u00e9cution;\u2026\nDans l\u2019affaire Monarch Steamship Co. Limited v. Karlshamns Oljefabriker A\/B, [1949] A.C. 196, la Chambre des Lords a suivi le principe appliqu\u00e9 par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire Wertheim v. Chicoutimi Pulp Company, et par le Juge Duff dans l\u2019affaire Cunningham c. Insinger, lequel principe est bas\u00e9 sur Hadley v. Baxendale, (1854), 9 Ex. 341. Lord Wright, aux pages 222 et 223, a repris les passages du discours de Lord Haldane que je viens de citer.\nDans la prochaine citation, tir\u00e9e du discours de Lord Du Parcq (page 232), celui-ci consid\u00e8re que les r\u00e8gles de la juste \u00e9valuation des dommages sont de simples m\u00e9thodes de r\u00e9soudre ce qui, apr\u00e8s tout, est essentiellement une question de fait, et que l\u2019application des r\u00e8gles doit varier selon les circonstances de chaque affaire:\n[TRADUCTION] Je ne mets pas en doute la sagesse des juges qui, dans l\u2019affaire Hadley v. Baxendale et dans plusieurs affaires subs\u00e9quentes o\u00f9 l\u2019on interpr\u00e8te ou explique cette d\u00e9cision classique, ont \u00e9tabli des r\u00e8gles ou principes pour guider ceux auxquels il incombe, de par leurs fonctions de juges ou de jur\u00e9s, d\u2019estimer des dommages. Toutefois, quand on applique ces r\u00e8gles ou principes, il est essentiel de se rappeler ce que mon noble et savant coll\u00e8gue Lord Wright, de m\u00eame que Lord Haldane dans le passage qu\u2019il a cit\u00e9, ont soulign\u00e9, savoir que ce qui doit \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9 est une question de fait et, par cons\u00e9quent, une question du ressort du jury. Les circonstances varient tellement que, m\u00eame si l\u2019on a mis beaucoup de soin \u00e0 formuler des r\u00e8gles g\u00e9n\u00e9rales, celles-ci doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es dans un sens large, et ne pas \u00eatre trop rigoureusement appliqu\u00e9es. Il s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9tablir des principes, de peur que les jur\u00e9s ne commettent des injustices en imposant aux d\u00e9fendeurs une responsabilit\u00e9 qui pourrait s\u2019av\u00e9rer trop l\u00e9g\u00e8re, ou trop lourde. Toutefois, la Cour doit veiller \u00e0 ce que les principes \u00e9tablis ne soient jamais interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s si \u00e9troitement qu\u2019ils emp\u00eachent un jury, ou un juge des faits, de rendre justice aux parties. Les appliquer dans ce sens serait en abuser.\nEn appliquant ces principes, le Juge en Chef Davey en est arriv\u00e9 aux conclusions suivantes:\n[TRADUCTION] Ainsi, en d\u00e9finitive, les appelantes ont re\u00e7u de l\u2019intim\u00e9e toutes les prestations dues en vertu du contrat principal et de l\u2019avenant, en contrepartie de leur engagement d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter les travaux d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abF\u00bb, telle que modifi\u00e9e par l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb, mais elles n\u2019ont rien ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 de ce qu\u2019elles s\u2019\u00e9taient engag\u00e9es \u00e0 faire en vertu de l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e des renseignements qu\u2019elle aurait obtenus par l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb, et pour lesquels elle avait pay\u00e9 en remplissant toutes ses obligations en vertu du contrat principal et de l\u2019avenant.\nSi l\u2019appelante avait rempli ses engagements, l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait re\u00e7u des renseignements valables sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Torbrit. Il est vrai que ces renseignements auraient pu d\u00e9montrer que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avait une grande valeur, ou n\u2019en avait aucune, mais m\u00eame dans cette derni\u00e8re hypoth\u00e8se, les renseignements auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cieux, en ce sens qu\u2019ils auraient permis \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019adopter une attitude r\u00e9aliste, et d\u2019\u00e9conomiser les frais courants de \u00abclaims\u00bb sans valeur. Il semble tout \u00e0 fait clair que la cons\u00e9quence directe et naturelle du d\u00e9faut de l\u2019appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 de priver l\u2019intim\u00e9e de renseignements essentiels sur la valeur de ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s, renseignements pour lesquels elle avait pay\u00e9. Le montant de cette perte est la valeur des renseignements que l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait obtenus si l\u2019appelante avait ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 son contrat en entreprenant le forage. La valeur de ces renseignements ne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par ce qu\u2019ils auraient r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9, puisque cela n\u2019est pas connu, mais par ce qu\u2019il en aurait co\u00fbt\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour les obtenir, en prenant, par analogie, la m\u00e9thode qui veut que la valeur de marchandises achet\u00e9es mais non livr\u00e9es soit leur co\u00fbt de remplacement: Wertheim v. Chicoutimi Pulp Company, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e.\nLes motifs du Juge d\u2019appel Branca pour confirmer le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance sont en substance semblables \u00e0 ceux du Juge en Chef. Le Juge d\u2019appel Nemetz a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019accord avec le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, pour consid\u00e9rer que cette affaire est semblable, quant aux faits, \u00e0 l\u2019affaire Cunningham et qu\u2019il faut appliquer la m\u00eame m\u00e9thode d\u2019\u00e9valuation des dommages.\nLa plaidoirie de l\u2019avocat de Sunshine devant cette Cour n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 me convaincre que, dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, les tribunaux de la Colombie-Britannique ont fait erreur en accordant \u00e0 Dolly Varden des dommages \u00e9quivalant aux d\u00e9penses \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb, que Sunshine s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e \u00e0 effectuer et qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment omis d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter. Ainsi que le pr\u00e9cise Lord Du Parcq dans le passage cit\u00e9 plus haut, ce qu\u2019il fallait d\u00e9cider, pour estimer les dommages, est une question de fait, et l\u2019affaire Cunningham \u00e9tablit clairement qu\u2019aucune r\u00e8gle de droit n\u2019exclut l\u2019application de la m\u00e9thode d\u2019\u00e9valuation des dommages adopt\u00e9e par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance dans cette affaire, quand la Cour l\u2019a jug\u00e9e appropri\u00e9e. Pour les motifs d\u00e9j\u00e0 expos\u00e9s, je ne pense pas que l\u2019affaire Cotter puisse \u00eatre, dans cet appel-ci, d\u2019aucun secours pour Sunshine.\nL\u2019avocat de Sunshine a soutenu que Dolly Varden n\u2019\u00e9tait en droit de recevoir, \u00e0 titre de dommages, que la diff\u00e9rence entre la valeur que les terrains auraient eue si les travaux avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s, et leur valeur sans ces travaux, et qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune preuve qui permettait d\u2019\u00e9tablir un dommage sur cette base. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, je ne pense pas que ce soit un juste crit\u00e8re pour fixer les dommages.\nL\u2019avocat de Sunshine s\u2019est fond\u00e9, \u00e0 ce sujet, sur deux affaires: Wigsell v. School for Indigent Blind[5] et James v. Hutton and J. Cook & Sons Ltd.[6]\nDans le premier cas, l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur d\u2019un terrain s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 \u00e0 construire un mur de briques de sept pieds de haut tout le long de la partie contigu\u00eb au terrain du c\u00e9dant. Le mur n\u2019ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 construit, une action en dommages lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e. La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le terrain contigu n\u2019\u00e9tait pas, de ce fait, d\u00e9pr\u00e9ci\u00e9 d\u2019un montant comparable au co\u00fbt du mur \u00e0 construire.\nLa Cour a refus\u00e9 d\u2019accorder des dommages \u00e9quivalents au co\u00fbt de construction du mur.\nIl s\u2019agissait, dans cette affaire-l\u00e0, d\u2019une stipulation accessoire, semblable \u00e0 une clause restrictive, impos\u00e9e par le vendeur pour prot\u00e9ger son terrain contigu; le montant des dommages, en pareil cas, est habituellement \u00e9tabli d\u2019apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation du terrain contigu par suite de la non-ex\u00e9cution des travaux. Dans des affaires de ce genre-l\u00e0, le c\u00e9dant peut exiger l\u2019ex\u00e9cution m\u00eame du contrat, si le recours en dommages ne prot\u00e8ge pas suffisamment ses droits.\nL\u2019autre affaire concerne l\u2019engagement pris par un locataire autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 faire des changements \u00e0 la devanture d\u2019un magasin qu\u2019il avait lou\u00e9. Il s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 \u00e0 remettre l\u2019immeuble en \u00e9tat, \u00e0 l\u2019expiration du bail, et ce, \u00e0 la demande du propri\u00e9taire. Il ne se conforma pas \u00e0 la demande du bailleur. Il ne fut pas prouv\u00e9 que la remise de l\u2019immeuble en \u00e9tat l\u2019aurait adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 telle ou telle fin, ou qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 endommag\u00e9 ou d\u00e9pr\u00e9ci\u00e9 par la substitution d\u2019une nouvelle devanture \u00e0 l\u2019ancienne.\nLa Cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le bailleur n\u2019avait droit de se faire d\u00e9dommager que pour les dommages effectivement subis et qui, en l\u2019occurrence, \u00e9taient purement symboliques. Toutefois, la Cour fit observer que l\u2019on n\u2019avait pas pr\u00e9tendu que le demandeur n\u2019\u00e9tait pas redevable \u00e0 prouver son intention d\u2019utiliser l\u2019immeuble \u00e0 des fins pour lesquelles la nouvelle devanture ne convenait pas. Je ne consid\u00e8re pas ces affaires-l\u00e0 comme ayant une analogie avec les faits invoqu\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente. L\u2019engagement de l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur, dans l\u2019affaire Wigsell, a, \u00e9t\u00e9 pris \u00e0 l\u2019avantage des terrains adjacents que retenait le c\u00e9dant. On ne pouvait pas, en l\u2019occurrence, d\u00e9terminer en fonction du co\u00fbt de construction du mur dans quelle mesure la valeur de ces terrains \u00e9tait r\u00e9duite par l\u2019inex\u00e9cution de l\u2019engagement. De m\u00eame dans l\u2019affaires James, l\u2019engagement pris par le locataire en rapport avec l\u2019autorisation donn\u00e9e par le bailleur \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019avantage de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019expiration du bail. En l\u2019absence d\u2019une preuve que l\u2019inex\u00e9cution de cet engagement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 nuisible \u00e0 l\u2019usage auquel les lieux \u00e9taient destin\u00e9s, ou \u00e0 leur valeur, \u00e0 l\u2019expiration du bail, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que le bailleur n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en droit de recouvrer le co\u00fbt de la remise en \u00e9tat de la devanture du magasin.\nLes contrats, dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, avaient trait \u00e0 une entreprise commune de prospection, de mise en valeur et d\u2019extraction du minerai renferm\u00e9 dans les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mini\u00e8res. On savait que ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e9taient prometteuses. La premi\u00e8re phase du contrat principal donnait \u00e0 Sunshine l\u2019occasion de voir si la rentabilit\u00e9 \u00e9ventuelle \u00e9tait suffisante pour justifier la d\u00e9cision de s\u2019engager dans la deuxi\u00e8me phase. Dolly Varden avait int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 voir Sunshine s\u2019engager dans les diff\u00e9rentes phases, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019extraction commerciale du minerai, mais, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019une telle progression des travaux, elle devait obtenir, suivant les stipulations du contrat, des renseignements complets sur les travaux effectu\u00e9s, leur r\u00e9sultat et les frais \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir. En un sens, et m\u00eame si le contrat stipulait qu\u2019il ne devait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme cr\u00e9ant une soci\u00e9t\u00e9, les parties \u00e9taient associ\u00e9s dans une entreprise commune.\nLes travaux d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb de l\u2019avenant \u00e9taient des travaux que Sunshine avait jug\u00e9s avantageux, apr\u00e8s une \u00e9tude de la mine Torbrit, et sur l\u2019avis de son g\u00e9ologue en chef. Elle s\u2019est engag\u00e9e \u00e0 effectuer des travaux en contrepartie des avantages consentis par Dolly Varden, et que Sunshine a re\u00e7us en totalit\u00e9. Elle s\u2019est \u00e9videmment engag\u00e9e \u00e0 faire ces travaux, parce qu\u2019elle a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019ils lui seraient pr\u00e9cieux. Dolly Varden a fourni la contrepartie convenue, parce que, si les r\u00e9sultats avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 favorables, sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en valeur; si, par ailleurs, Sunshine n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaite des r\u00e9sultats, elle aurait obtenu des renseignements utiles sur sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Il est clair que dans cette affaire les deux parties ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que les travaux \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter vaudraient les frais occasionn\u00e9s. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une situation enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rente de celles cr\u00e9\u00e9es par les engagements consentis dans les deux affaires susmentionn\u00e9es et dont l\u2019ex\u00e9cution ne pouvait profiter, si peu que ce soit, qu\u2019au c\u00e9dant et au bailleur, respectivement.\nQuand Sunshine a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment rompu, par la suite, son engagement d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter les travaux, quel pouvait \u00eatre le montant des dommages \u00e0 allouer \u00e0 Dolly Varden? Si elle avait donn\u00e9 de l\u2019argent pour les travaux, elle aurait \u00e9videmment eu droit au remboursement de la somme pay\u00e9e, et elle aurait \u00e9galement pu r\u00e9clamer des dommages. La contrepartie fournie n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de l\u2019argent comptant, mais Sunshine, en signant l\u2019avenant, a jug\u00e9 que la valeur de cette contrepartie pouvait justifier les d\u00e9penses n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux.\nIl est impossible, dans ces conditions, de chercher \u00e0 comparer la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mini\u00e8re transform\u00e9e par l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux avec la valeur de cette m\u00eame propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sans ces travaux. Le r\u00e9sultat des travaux d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb n\u2019est pas connu, et il en est ainsi du fait que Sunshine a choisi de rompre le contrat sign\u00e9 pour leur ex\u00e9cution. Mais, alors que, d\u2019une part, Sunshine, par son adh\u00e9sion au contrat, a reconnu que son propre programme de travail valait bien le co\u00fbt de son ex\u00e9cution, vu les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices possibles qu\u2019elle pouvait retirer du contrat, et que, d\u2019autre part, Dolly Varden \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 verser, et a effectivement vers\u00e9, une contrepartie appr\u00e9ciable pour la r\u00e9alisation de ce programme, je consid\u00e8re qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait judicieux de la part du juge de premi\u00e8re instance d\u2019\u00e9valuer le dommage r\u00e9sultant de la rupture du contrat \u00e0 un montant \u00e9quivalent au co\u00fbt de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux. Ce faisant, il a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 se conformer au principe fondamental \u00e9tabli par Lord Atkinson dans l\u2019affaire Wertheim v. Chicoutimi Pulp Co.[7], et cit\u00e9 par le Juge Cartwright dans l\u2019affaire Cotter: [TRADUCTION] Et la loi vise g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, en accordant des dommages pour rupture de contrat, \u00e0 mettre le demandeur, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela peut se faire par l\u2019allocation d\u2019une somme d\u2019argent, dans l\u2019\u00e9tat o\u00f9 il se serait trouv\u00e9 si le contrat avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9.\n\u00c9tant arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 cette conclusion, il me faut maintenant voir si le droit aux dommages d\u00e9termin\u00e9s de cette mani\u00e8re se trouve modifi\u00e9 par le fait que Dolly Varden a conclu avec Newmont un contrat qui n\u2019est devenu ex\u00e9cutoire qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019institution par Dolly Varden d\u2019une action en dommages contre Sunshine, et l\u2019audition de la cause.\nDevant cette Cour, l\u2019avocat de Sunshine n\u2019a pas soutenu que les prestations dues \u00e0 Dolly Varden en vertu de ce dernier contrat pouvaient \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9es en r\u00e9duction des dommages. Sa pr\u00e9tention a \u00e9t\u00e9 que la r\u00e9duction des dommages n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer parce que, a-t-il dit, Dolly Varden n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 avoir subi un dommage quelconque. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9 pourquoi je ne suis pas d\u2019accord avec cette derni\u00e8re affirmation. D\u2019apr\u00e8s sa plaidoirie, le contrat Newmont est pertinent pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019\u00e0 dater de son entr\u00e9e en vigueur, Dolly Varden a abandonn\u00e9 toute possibilit\u00e9 ou intention d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter elle-m\u00eame les travaux d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb, et que, de ce fait, cette affaire ne pr\u00e9sente aucune analogie avec l\u2019affaire Cunningham.\nLa m\u00eame argumentation a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en premi\u00e8re instance, et, \u00e0 ce sujet, le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu comme suit:\n[TRADUCTION] Toutefois, j\u2019ai conclu que ces travaux \u00e9taient justifi\u00e9s \u00e9conomiquement et n\u00e9cessaires dans le cadre du programme g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de mise en valeur de la mine Torbrit. Je retiens aussi le t\u00e9moignage des administrateurs de la compagnie demanderesse, selon lequel c\u2019est leur intention ferme d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter les travaux d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb.\nLe fait que le nouveau contrat pass\u00e9 avec Newmont ne fasse pas sp\u00e9cifiquement allusion \u00e0 ces travaux, et ne comporte aucune mesure relative \u00e0 leur ex\u00e9cution imm\u00e9diate, ne signifie pas que la demanderesse n\u2019a pas l\u2019intention de les ex\u00e9cuter, ou de les faire ex\u00e9cuter, et n\u2019exclut point la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019ils soient ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s. Ces travaux \u00e9tant une \u00e9tape n\u00e9cessaire dans la mise en valeur des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s mini\u00e8res, le recours \u00e0 un nouveau commettant ne peut pas justifier, en lui-m\u00eame, la conclusion que les travaux ne seront pas faits. Je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 remettre en cause cette conclusion. Bien plus, je ne consid\u00e8re pas que le contrat Newmont ait aucune influence sur le sort de ce litige. Le contrat pass\u00e9 avec Sunshine a pris fin \u00e0 l\u2019expiration de la premi\u00e8re phase de mise en valeur. Sunshine n\u2019a donn\u00e9 aucun avis de son intention de prolonger cette p\u00e9riode ou d\u2019entreprendre la seconde phase. Elle a rompu le contrat. A mon avis, imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s la rupture du contrat, et pour les raisons d\u00e9j\u00e0 invoqu\u00e9es, Dolly Varden avait le droit de r\u00e9clamer des dommages \u00e9quivalents au co\u00fbt d\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb, droit qu\u2019elle a fait valoir en intentant une action contre Sunshine. D\u00e8s la rupture du contrat, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mini\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9e pour compte \u00e0 Dolly Varden qui, plus tard, a pu conclure un contrat avec Newmont pour sa mise en valeur. En vertu de ce contrat, les travaux que devait effectuer Newmont \u00e9taient laiss\u00e9s \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion, sous r\u00e9serve de son engagement, si elle d\u00e9cidait d\u2019entamer la seconde phase et les phases ult\u00e9rieures, de d\u00e9penser les montants convenus pour la mise en valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9e d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter les travaux pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb. Dans ces conditions, je ne vois pas comment ce contrat peut porter atteinte au droit de Dolly Varden d\u2019obtenir des dommages \u00e9quivalents au co\u00fbt des travaux d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00abA\u00bb, par suite du d\u00e9faut de Sunshine d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter ces travaux; ce droit d\u2019action a pris naissance au moment de la rupture du contrat Sunshine.\nJe suis d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs des d\u00e9fenderesses, appelantes: Bull, Housser & Tupper, Vancouver.\nProcureurs de la demanderesse, intim\u00e9e: Cumming, Bird, Richards & Co., Vancouver.\n[1] (1968), 69 D.L.R.

Cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 agissait comme entrepreneur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pour la construction de certaines stations du m\u00e9tro de Toronto, sur la ligne Bloor-Danforth. Le 22 septembre 1967, elle a fait cession de ses biens, en faillite, et elle a abandonn\u00e9 les travaux. Les appelants sont des sous-traitants d\u2019Anglin-Norcross et apr\u00e8s sa faillite, ils ont enregistr\u00e9 des r\u00e9clamations de privil\u00e8ge.

Lors de la faillite, la Toronto Transit Commission avait en main:\n(a) le plein montant de la retenue statutaire en vertu de The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, et\n(b) d\u2019autres sommes, repr\u00e9sentant la valeur de travaux dont l\u2019ex\u00e9cution \u00e9tait attest\u00e9e mais le paiement n\u2019avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9.\nIl n\u2019y a pas de probl\u00e8me quant \u00e0 la retenue statutaire.

Les d\u00e9tenteurs des privil\u00e8ges en appellent \u00e0 cette Cour de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel.\nL\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue devant le protonotaire, la Cour d\u2019appel et cette Cour, sur un expos\u00e9 des faits accept\u00e9 par toutes les parties. Devant cette Cour, les avocats ont ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 cet expos\u00e9 une entente sur le sens de deux expressions. Il ne servirait \u00e0 rien de relater l\u2019expos\u00e9 de faits et les deux d\u00e9finitions. Les faits sont clairs. La seule question est la suivante: Qui a droit \u00e0 la priorit\u00e9 sur la somme exc\u00e9dant la retenue statutaire?\nJe suis d\u2019accord avec le jugement de la majorit\u00e9 en Cour d\u2019appel, tant sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act que sur l\u2019analyse de la jurisprudence. En rendant l\u2019arr\u00eat du 11 d\u00e9cembre 1968, la Cour d\u2019appel a suivi son propre arr\u00eat du 15 octobre 1968 dans l\u2019affaire S.I. Guttman Ltd. v. James D. Mokry Ltd. et al.[1], o\u00f9 la question de droit \u00e9tait exactement la m\u00eame.\nL\u2019article 5(1) de The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act accorde \u00e0 quiconque fournit un travail, des services ou des mat\u00e9riaux un privil\u00e8ge limit\u00e9 cependant \u00e0 la somme \u00e0 laquelle le cr\u00e9ancier privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 a droit en justice et \u00e0 celle que le propri\u00e9taire doit en justice payer, sauf dans la mesure o\u00f9 il est autrement prescrit.\nLes articles 9 et 10, qui sont subordonn\u00e9s \u00e0 cette restriction, la r\u00e9it\u00e8rent. Ils se lisent comme suit:\n[TRADUCTION] 9. Sauf disposition contraire aux pr\u00e9sentes, le privil\u00e8ge n\u2019a pas l\u2019effet d\u2019obliger le propri\u00e9taire \u00e0 payer une somme sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle qu\u2019il doit \u00e0 l\u2019entrepreneur.\n10. Sauf disposition contraire aux pr\u00e9sentes, quand une personne autre que l\u2019entrepreneur r\u00e9clame un privil\u00e8ge, sa r\u00e9clamation se limite \u00e0 la somme due \u00e0 l\u2019entrepreneur, sous-traitant ou autre personne pour qui le travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, les services ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus ou les mat\u00e9riaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis ou pos\u00e9s.\nL\u2019art. 11(1) et (2) traite de la retenue. Dans ce cas-ci, elle est de 15 pour cent. Cette somme est disponible en totalit\u00e9 pour les privil\u00e8ges.\nL\u2019art. 11(6) dispose que tous les paiements, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de 85 pour cent dans ce cas-ci, faits de bonne foi par le propri\u00e9taire \u00e0 l\u2019entrepreneur avant qu\u2019une notification \u00e9crite du privil\u00e8ge ait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e, diminuent d\u2019autant le privil\u00e8ge.\nL\u2019art. 11(7) traite de l\u2019affectation de la retenue apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode de retenue.\nL\u2019art. 11(9) interdit au propri\u00e9taire d\u2019affecter la retenue au paiement de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour d\u00e9faut d\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat, il faut l\u2019affecter au paiement des privil\u00e8ges.\nJusqu\u2019ici, il n\u2019y a rien dans la loi qui justifie la r\u00e9clamation des d\u00e9tenteurs des privil\u00e8ges contre la somme exc\u00e9dant la retenue. Les d\u00e9tenteurs de privil\u00e8ges pr\u00e9tendent fonder leur r\u00e9clamation sur l\u2019art. 12(2) de la loi, qui se lit comme suit:\n[TRADUCTION] 12. (2) Tout sous-traitant a droit d\u2019exercer son privil\u00e8ge nonobstant la non ex\u00e9cution ou l\u2019abandon du contrat par n\u2019importe quel entrepreneur ou sous-traitant \u00e0 l\u2019encontre duquel il r\u00e9clame.\nOn a soutenu que cela \u00e9carte toute r\u00e9clamation du propri\u00e9taire en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour non ex\u00e9cution, ou abandon du contrat, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du sous-traitant, ou toute priorit\u00e9 sur le privil\u00e8ge du sous\u2011traitant.\nCet article remonte \u00e0 1923. Ses effets ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s dans Freedman v. Guaranty Trust Co. of Canada[2]. Il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 d\u2019une affaire o\u00f9 l\u2019entrepreneur avait abandonn\u00e9 le contrat et s\u2019\u00e9tait enfui. Sans la promulgation de ce qui constitue maintenant l\u2019article 12(2), pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, le sous-traitant n\u2019aurait eu aucun recours. L\u2019effet de la modification est expos\u00e9 par le Juge d\u2019appel Masten (\u00e0 la page 203) comme suit:\n[TRADUCTION] En d\u2019autres termes il est, par cette disposition de la loi, plac\u00e9 pour l\u2019exercice de son privil\u00e8ge sur le m\u00eame pied que si les travaux, au point o\u00f9 ils en \u00e9taient lors de l\u2019abandon, constituaient pro tanto une ex\u00e9cution l\u00e9gale du contrat et si l\u2019entrepreneur principal \u00e9tait en droit de se faire payer par le propri\u00e9taire, sur une base de quantum meruit, la valeur du travail ex\u00e9cut\u00e9.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, les droits du sous-traitant sont ceux que la loi lui attribuent quels qu\u2019ils soient. On a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le propri\u00e9taire autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 faire valoir, contre le montant d\u00fb \u00e0 l\u2019entrepreneur, le co\u00fbt du parach\u00e8vement de l\u2019immeuble et des dommages pour le retard.\nLe Juge d\u2019appel Schroeder signale, dans l\u2019affaire Guttman, que l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de ce pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 remise en question, m\u00eame pas dans la d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente de la Cour d\u2019appel dans Vaillancourt Lumber Co. Ltd: v. Trustees of Separate School Section No. 2, Township of Balfour et al.[3] Dans les motifs de la Cour d\u2019appel, on a signal\u00e9 comment l\u2019affaire Vaillancourt diff\u00e8re de celle-ci. Le propri\u00e9taire avait re\u00e7u une d\u00e9nonciation \u00e9crite du privil\u00e8ge d\u2019un sous\u2011traitant. Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u cette d\u00e9nonciation, il a fait un autre paiement \u00e0 l\u2019entrepreneur. Cela lui fit perdre la protection accord\u00e9e par l\u2019article 11(6) de la loi:\n[TRADUCTION] 11. (6) Tous les paiements, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de 80 pour cent, tel que d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par le paragraphe 1, ou de 85 pour cent, tel que d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par le paragraphe 2, et tous les paiements autoris\u00e9s par l\u2019application des paragraphes 3 et 4, faits de bonne foi par un propri\u00e9taire \u00e0 un entrepreneur, par un entrepreneur \u00e0 un sous\u2011traitant ou par un sous-traitant \u00e0 un autre sous-traitant avant la notification par \u00e9crit du privil\u00e8ge, de la part de la personne le r\u00e9clamant, au propri\u00e9taire, entrepreneur, ou sous-traitant, selon le cas, ont pour effet de r\u00e9duire pour autant le privil\u00e8ge.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, non seulement la retenue mais aussi la somme additionnelle pay\u00e9e apr\u00e8s la notification du privil\u00e8ge auraient d\u00fb rester \u00e0 la disposition de celui qui le r\u00e9clamait.\nIl n\u2019y a rien de semblable dans le cas pr\u00e9sent. Le propri\u00e9taire n\u2019a fait aucun paiement apr\u00e8s la notification du privil\u00e8ge. Il avait retenu une somme additionnelle et sa r\u00e9clamation pour non ex\u00e9cution du contrat n\u2019est reli\u00e9e qu\u2019\u00e0 cette somme. Il a encore droit au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019article 11(6) et il ne peut \u00eatre astreint \u00e0 rendre cette somme disponible, en plus de la retenue, pour le sous-traitant d\u00e9tenteur de privil\u00e8ge. J\u2019adopte les motifs de la majorit\u00e9 en Cour d\u2019appel dans l\u2019affaire Guttman.\nJe suis d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppels rejet\u00e9s avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelante: Campbell, Godfrey & Lewtas, Toronto.\nProcureurs des intim\u00e9s, The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto et The Toronto Transit Commission: Bassel, Sullivan, Holland & Lawson, Toronto.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9, le Syndic de la faillite de Anglin-Norcross Ontario Limited, Faillie: Harries, Houser, Brown, Houlden & McCallum, Toronto.\n[1] [1969] 1 O.R. 7, 1 D.L.R.

Quoique le demandeur n\u2019\u00e9tait pas bl\u00e2m\u00e9 directement, le rapport r\u00e9v\u00e9lait que le demandeur manquait gravement d\u2019aptitudes pour l\u2019administration. Le d\u00e9fendeur a r\u00e9solu de le muter \u00e0 une autre division du m\u00eame service. Cette mutation ne modifiait pas la classification d\u2019emploi du demandeur, ni son salaire, ni ses droits \u00e0 la pension de retraite. Le demandeur a refus\u00e9 d\u2019accepter la mutation et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment cong\u00e9di\u00e9. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu l\u2019action en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour cong\u00e9diement non motiv\u00e9, mais ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019appel.

En mai 1958, on le nommait surintendant int\u00e9rimaire de ladite division, \u00e0 la suite de la d\u00e9mission du surintendant, un nomm\u00e9 Rousseau. Cette d\u00e9mission r\u00e9sultait d\u2019all\u00e9gations publiques qu\u2019il y avait eu de graves irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s dans l\u2019administration de cette division; par suite de ces accusations l\u2019intim\u00e9 L\u2019Allier, en tant que directeur du Service des travaux publics, avait mis sur pied un comit\u00e9 d\u2019enqu\u00eate.\nLe 30 janvier 1959, le comit\u00e9 d\u2019enqu\u00eate d\u00e9posait son rapport aupr\u00e8s du Comit\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutif de la Ville. Ce rapport r\u00e9v\u00e9lait qu\u2019il y avait eu de graves irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s dans l\u2019administration de la division de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9. Quoique le comit\u00e9 d\u2019enqu\u00eate n\u2019ait pas bl\u00e2m\u00e9 Filion directement dans son rapport, comme le souligne le Juge en chef Tremblay dans les motifs de son jugement, le rapport r\u00e9v\u00e9lait tout de m\u00eame que Filion manquait gravement d\u2019aptitudes pour l\u2019administration, quelle qu\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence en tant qu\u2019ing\u00e9nieur en \u00e9lectricit\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 le rapport du comit\u00e9 d\u2019enqu\u00eate, L\u2019Allier, en sa qualit\u00e9 de directeur du Service des travaux publics, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les services de Filion n\u2019\u00e9taient plus utiles \u00e0 la division de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s quelques h\u00e9sitations, il a r\u00e9solu de le muter \u00e0 une autre division du m\u00eame Service, la division des \u00e9difices. Cette mutation ne modifiait pas la classification d\u2019emploi de Filion en tant qu\u2019assistant-ing\u00e9nieur-surintendant, ni son salaire, ni ses droits \u00e0 la pension de retraite.\nDans ses motifs, le Juge en chef Tremblay r\u00e9sume de la fa\u00e7on suivante ce qui est survenu par la suite:\nL\u2019Allier assigna Filion \u00e0 la division des \u00e9difices. Apr\u00e8s avoir d\u2019abord accept\u00e9, Filion, non satisfait des conditions de travail qui lui sont faites, se ravise et, dans la lettre du 25 mars 1959 cit\u00e9e par monsieur le Juge Casey, ses avocats, en son nom, adoptent l\u2019attitude que leur client a droit de continuer \u00e0 exercer la fonction d\u2019assistant\u2011ing\u00e9nieur\u2011surintendant du service de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 et menacent la ville et L\u2019Allier de proc\u00e9dures judiciaires \u00ab\u00e0 moins que monsieur Filion soit replac\u00e9 dans sa position originaire\u00bb.\nLe 15 avril 1959, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la lettre du 25 mars cit\u00e9e par le Juge en chef, L\u2019Allier recommande au Comit\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutif de cong\u00e9dier Filion, avec effet au 25 mars 1959. Le 22 avril 1959, le Comit\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutif adopte une r\u00e9solution donnant suite \u00e0 cette recommandation.\nLe 22 juillet 1959, l\u2019appelant a intent\u00e9 une action en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats par laquelle il r\u00e9clame la somme de $183,957.80 pour cong\u00e9diement non motiv\u00e9. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu l\u2019action jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de la somme de $129,214.70. La Cour du banc de la reine a infirm\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9.\nVu les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, je ne crois pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019\u00e9tudier les conditions qui r\u00e9gissaient l\u2019emploi de Filion. La question essentielle qui se pose est celle de savoir si Filion \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 de refuser la mutation \u00e0 une autre division du m\u00eame Service, mutation d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par L\u2019Allier en tant que directeur de ce service.

Conclure autrement imposerait dans l\u2019administration de ce service une rigidit\u00e9 injustifiable et paralyserait le service. Il s\u2019ensuit que, par suite du refus de l\u2019appelant d\u2019accepter la d\u00e9cision du directeur, la Ville \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e de cong\u00e9dier l\u2019appelant.\nPour ces motifs, et pour ceux qu\u2019a exprim\u00e9s le Juge en chef Tremblay et auxquels je souscris dans l\u2019ensemble, je rejetterais l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs du demandeur, appelant: G\u00e9linas, Bourque, Lalonde & Beno\u00eet, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs de la d\u00e9fenderesse, Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al: Pag\u00e9, Mercier & Beauregard, Montr\u00e9al\nProcureur du d\u00e9fendeur, L\u2019Allier: D.

Shorteno, d\u00e9clara les requ\u00e9rants coupables sur deux chefs d\u2019accusation de tentative de meurtre.\nL\u2019appel log\u00e9 contre ce verdict de culpabilit\u00e9 fut rejet\u00e9 le 7 ao\u00fbt 1969 par un jugement unanime de la Cour d\u2019appel1, alors form\u00e9e de MM. les Juges Casey, Taschereau, Choquette, Brossard et Salvas.\nLes requ\u00e9rants demandent la permission d\u2019appeler de ce jugement.\nNous sommes tous d\u2019avis que cette demande doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Nous croyons, cependant, qu\u2019il convient de dire un mot en ce qui concerne le grief sur lequel est centr\u00e9e la demande, grief qu\u2019on a invoqu\u00e9 au soutien de l\u2019appel en Cour du Banc de la Reine et qui d\u00e9coule des faits suivants.\nAu cours de l\u2019enqu\u00eate au proc\u00e8s, le procureur des accus\u00e9s tenta de recourir \u00e0 la langue fran\u00e7aise pour l\u2019examen de t\u00e9moins d\u2019expression fran\u00e7aise. Le juge refusa de le lui permettre; il consid\u00e9ra que les deux accus\u00e9s \u00e9taient d\u2019expression anglaise, qu\u2019ils avaient choisi d\u2019\u00eatre jug\u00e9s par un jury compos\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement de jur\u00e9s parlant leur langue, que telle \u00e9tait, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la composition actuelle du jury et qu\u2019au surplus, le procureur des accus\u00e9s, bien que francophone, \u00e9tait parfaitement familier avec la langue anglaise.\nRien n\u2019indique et on n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9tendu devant nous que la demande du procureur des accus\u00e9s avait pour but de paralyser le cours normal des proc\u00e9dures. Aussi bien, convient-il de dire qu\u2019au regard des dispositions de l\u2019art. 133 de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique, le refus du pr\u00e9sident des assises de faire droit \u00e0 sa demande constitue une d\u00e9cision erron\u00e9e sur une question de droit. Ajoutons que sur une question pos\u00e9e sur le point au procureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e au tout d\u00e9but de l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate, ce dernier n\u2019a pas h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre cette erreur.\nPartageant cependant l\u2019opinion unanime de la Cour d\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019aucun tort ou erreur judiciaire n\u2019est r\u00e9sult\u00e9 de cette erreur ou des autres griefs invoqu\u00e9s au soutien de la demande, il s\u2019ensuit que le rejet de l\u2019appel fond\u00e9 sur les dispositions de l\u2019article 592(1)(b)(iii) du Code criminel est bien fond\u00e9.\nLa requ\u00eate pour permission d\u2019appeler est rejet\u00e9e.\nRequ\u00eate rejet\u00e9e.\nProcureur des requ\u00e9rants: Ivan Sabourin, St-Jean.\nProcureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e: L.

L\u2019indemnit\u00e9 ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e \u00e0 $1,589,225 alors que le montant de l\u2019offre \u00e9tait de $669,770, le droit aux d\u00e9pens leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu.

A l\u2019audition, nous avons fait observer \u00e0 leur avocat que, pour ce qui concerne la comp\u00e9tence de cette Cour, l\u2019affaire est identique \u00e0 la cause Clarke c. Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Ontario et autres[1]. Comme ici, la Cour d\u2019appel avait rejet\u00e9, sur requ\u00eate, un appel d\u2019un jugement de premi\u00e8re instance sur une requ\u00eate en revision de la taxation de d\u00e9pens s\u2019\u00e9levant \u00e0 plus de $10,000, soit en l\u2019occurrence \u00e0 $29,230.50. L\u2019appelant ayant form\u00e9 un pourvoi de plein droit \u00e0 cette Cour, les intim\u00e9s ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en annulation le 17 f\u00e9vrier dernier (1969). Ayant consid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audition de cette requ\u00eate la jurisprudence ant\u00e9rieure, notamment Montr\u00e9al Tramways c. Creely[2] ainsi que Wabasso Cotton Co. c. La Commission des relations ouvri\u00e8res[3] sans oublier Fiset c. Morin[4], le tribunal en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel \u00e9tait un jugement d\u00e9finitif dans une affaire o\u00f9 \u00abla mati\u00e8re en litige\u00bb d\u00e9passait $10,000 et, par cons\u00e9quent, susceptible d\u2019appel de plein droit \u00e0 cette Cour en vertu de l\u2019article 36. La d\u00e9cision rendue verbalement par le Juge en chef est comme suit: [TRADUCTION] NOUS sommes tous d\u2019avis que la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas le droit d\u2019interjeter appel du jugement du Juge Lieff sans autorisation en est une qui statue sur un droit acquis de l\u2019appelant. Si ce jugement n\u2019est pas modifi\u00e9, il s\u2019ensuit que l\u2019appelant devra payer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 la somme de $29,230.50. Le montant en litige dans le pourvoi \u00e0 cette Cour est donc de plus de $10,000. La requ\u00eate en annulation est rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nDans les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente cause il para\u00eet \u00e0 propos, comme l\u2019avocat des appelants nous a invit\u00e9s \u00e0 le faire, de traiter sa requ\u00eate comme une demande de prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour loger le pourvoi et de l\u2019accorder aux conditions auxquelles il est ordinairement fait droit \u00e0 une telle demande.\nPour ces motifs, le d\u00e9lai pour interjeter appel \u00e0 cette Cour du jugement rendu par la Cour du Banc de la Reine de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec si\u00e9geant en appel le 15 mai 1969 est prorog\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019expiration de quinze jours \u00e0 compter de la date du pr\u00e9sent jugement, les d\u00e9pens de la requ\u00eate des appelants \u00e9tant \u00e0 leur charge.\nProcureurs des requ\u00e9rants: Desch\u00eanes, de Grandpr\u00e9, Colas, Godin & Lapointe, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9e: Martineau, Walker, Allison, Beaulieu, Tetley & Phelan, Montr\u00e9al.\n[1] [1969] R.C.S. 953.\n[2] [1949] R.C.S. 197, [1949] 2 D.L.R. 404.\n[3] [1953] 2 R.C.S. 469, [1954] 2 D.L.R. 193.\n[4] [1945] R.C.S. 520, [1945] 3 D.L.R. 800.",

Le contrat stipulait que le prix \u00e9tait sujet \u00e0 des ajustements y compris le montant de toute taxe de vente f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou provinciale impos\u00e9e par la loi. Cette exemption a \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9e le 14 juin 1963 par une loi d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant en m\u00eame temps qu\u2019il pouvait \u00eatre accord\u00e9, dans le cas de contrat pour un montant forfaitaire, un remboursement de la taxe devenue payable par un vendeur dont le contrat ne permettait pas d\u2019ajouter la taxe au montant du prix d\u2019achat. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a pay\u00e9 la taxe sous prot\u00eat sur des fonds vers\u00e9s par l\u2019acheteur conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 une convention sous forme de lettre disant que l\u2019acheteur ne reconnaissait aucune obligation de payer la taxe et que l\u2019intim\u00e9e devait demander un remboursement et le remettre \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur. Sans avis au Ministre du Revenu National, une requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame de l\u2019Ontario demandant un jugement d\u00e9claratoire des droits des parties au contrat. La Cour rendit un jugement d\u00e9clarant l\u2019intim\u00e9e seule tenue de payer la taxe. Une p\u00e9tition de droit a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 produite par l\u2019intim\u00e9e demandant le remboursement. La Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier accueillit la p\u00e9tition seulement parce qu\u2019elle se consid\u00e9rait oblig\u00e9e de suivre la d\u00e9cision d\u2019une autre Cour de juridiction \u00e9gale ou \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 moins d\u2019une raison grave. Cependant, la Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que si l\u2019affaire \u00e9tait venue devant elle \u00e0 l\u2019origine, elle aurait conclu autrement. La Couronne en appela \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLe Juge en Chef Cartwright: La Cour supr\u00eame de l\u2019Ontario avait comp\u00e9tence dans l\u2019affaire, tant pour interpr\u00e9ter le contrat que pour rendre un jugement liant les parties en cause. Ce jugement n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un jugement in rem et il liait seulement les parties en cause. Si l\u2019on veut recouvrer certaines sommes de la Couronne en s\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019article permettant le remboursement et si la r\u00e9alisation de la condition prescrite est mise en question, il semble \u00e9vident que la Couronne doit \u00eatre partie \u00e0 l\u2019instance. Le sens v\u00e9ritable du contrat permet \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de recouvrer de l\u2019acheteur le montant de la taxe parce que le texte pr\u00e9voit la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une taxe future qui sera mise \u00e0 la charge de l\u2019acheteur sous forme d\u2019augmentation du prix. Cette Cour n\u2019est aucunement li\u00e9e par le jugement de la Cour de l\u2019Ontario. Il s\u2019ensuit que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne peut recouvrer de la Couronne le montant de la taxe.\nLes Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson et Ritchie: La Cour supr\u00eame de l\u2019Ontario n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour lier la Couronne dans cette affaire. Le contrat pr\u00e9voyait en termes nets la transmission de la taxe \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur. Aux termes de la loi abrogeant l\u2019exemption, la taxe devait \u00eatre pay\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e. La responsabilit\u00e9 pour cette taxe \u00e9tait une question ne concernant que le contribuable et le Ministre. La taxe pay\u00e9e sous prot\u00eat ne pouvait \u00eatre recouvr\u00e9e que par une p\u00e9tition de droit en Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier en vertu de l\u2019art. 18(1) (d) de la Loi sut-la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier. Le probl\u00e8me qui a inqui\u00e9t\u00e9 le juge de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier n\u2019a jamais exist\u00e9 en r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Seule la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier avait comp\u00e9tence pour rendre une d\u00e9cision, sans \u00eatre entrav\u00e9e par le jugement d\u00e9claratoire de la Cour de l\u2019Ontario.\nLes Juges Hall, Spence et Pigeon: Le juge de la Cour de l\u2019Ontario n\u2019avait pas juridiction. Le tribunal comp\u00e9tent pour statuer sur les droits de citoyens parties \u00e0 un contrat c\u2019est la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de leur province. Si l\u2019on examine la question soumise \u00e0 la Cour de l\u2019Ontario \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de tous les faits pertinents, y compris la convention sous forme de lettre en vertu de laquelle tout doute sur le droit pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e de recouvrer de l\u2019acheteur la taxe avait disparu et par l\u2019effet de laquelle c\u2019est pour l\u2019acheteur et non pour elle\u2011m\u00eame que l\u2019intim\u00e9e r\u00e9clame aujourd\u2019hui, on s\u2019aper\u00e7oit que le v\u00e9ritable objet de la requ\u00eate n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de faire d\u00e9cider si l\u2019une des parties avait droit de recouvrer de l\u2019autre la taxe de vente mais bien de faire juger si l\u2019une d\u2019elles avait droit de la recouvrer du gouvernement du Canada au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019autre. Cette affaire \u00e9tait de la comp\u00e9tence exclusive de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier. On ne peut pas consid\u00e9rer l\u2019acheteur comme \u00e9tranger \u00e0 l\u2019affaire. Il se trouve dans la m\u00eame situation qu\u2019une personne pour l\u2019avantage de laquelle un tiers intente une poursuite. Il s\u2019ensuit que la pr\u00e9sente cause doit \u00eatre jug\u00e9e sans tenir compte du jugement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par la Cour de l\u2019Ontario. L\u2019opinion de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier sur la conclusion \u00e0 tirer dans cette alternative est parfaitement exacte.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement du Juge Cattanach de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier du Canada[1], accueillant une p\u00e9tition de droit. Appel accueilli.\nC.R.O. Munro, c.r., et Derek Aylen, pour l\u2019appelante.\nG.F. Henderson, c.r., et B.A. Crane, pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nLE JUGE EN CHEF\u2014Les faits pertinents et les dispositions statutaires applicables sont relat\u00e9s dans les motifs de mon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Pigeon et il n\u2019est pas besoin de les r\u00e9p\u00e9ter. Je veux toutefois insister sur un fait qu\u2019il mentionne, savoir qu\u2019au cours de l\u2019audition dans cette Cour, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelante, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question d\u2019un juge, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que les proc\u00e9dures devant le Juge Landreville avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises ou men\u00e9es de mauvaise foi. Rien n\u2019indique que des mesures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises en vue de faire infirmer ou casser le jugement du Juge Landreville. Le d\u00e9lai d\u2019appel de ce jugement est expir\u00e9 depuis longtemps bien qu\u2019il pourrait encore, je suppose, \u00eatre prolong\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019appel de l\u2019Ontario.\nLorsque la question a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e entre Atlas Steels Company, que j\u2019appellerai Atlas, et l\u2019auteur de la pr\u00e9sente intim\u00e9e quant au sens v\u00e9ri- table du par. (a) de la clause 18 du contrat du 15 avril 1963, il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident qu\u2019en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019art. 10 du chapitre 12, Statuts du Canada 1963, 12 Eliz. II, cit\u00e9 dans les motifs de mon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Pigeon, les seules personnes ayant un int\u00e9r\u00eat p\u00e9cuniaire appr\u00e9ciable dans la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question \u00e9taient la pr\u00e9sente appelante et Atlas. Si l\u2019on devait d\u00e9cider que l\u2019intim\u00e9e pouvait ajouter le montant de la taxe au prix de vente, ce montant lui serait vers\u00e9 par Atlas; si l\u2019on jugeait qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas le faire, elle aurait droit de recouvrer de l\u2019appelante le montant de la taxe. Dans ces circonstances, il est difficile de comprendre pourquoi la question a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e dans une instance \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019appelante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas partie. Nous devons toutefois examiner les circonstances de l\u2019affaire comme elles sont.\nJe pense qu\u2019il est clair que la Cour Supr\u00eame de l\u2019Ontario avait comp\u00e9tence dans l\u2019affaire dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie entre Atlas et l\u2019intim\u00e9e, tant pour interpr\u00e9ter le contrat du 15 avril 1963 que pour rendre un jugement liant les parties en cause. Je crois qu\u2019il est \u00e9galement clair que le jugement prononc\u00e9 par le Juge Landreville n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un jugement in rem et qu\u2019il liait seulement les parties en cause dans cette affaire-l\u00e0.\nDans l\u2019action faisant l\u2019objet du pourvoi, la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier[2] a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie de la m\u00eame question que le Juge Landreville, savoir si d\u2019apr\u00e8s son sens v\u00e9ritable le contrat par \u00e9crit du 15 avril 1963 permettait \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019ajouter la taxe au montant que devait lui remettre Atlas. La question n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de savoir si, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e pourrait effectivement recouvrer la taxe d\u2019Atlas; il s\u2019agissait uniquement de savoir quel \u00e9tait le sens v\u00e9ritable du contrat \u00e9crit.\nDans l\u2019action faisant l\u2019objet du pourvoi, les consid\u00e9rations suivantes, si elles sont fond\u00e9es, savoir (i) que le jugement du Juge Landreville emp\u00eachera l\u2019intim\u00e9e de recouvrer la taxe d\u2019Atlas ou (ii) que, par suite de la correspondance entre Atlas et l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui est relat\u00e9e dans les motifs de mon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Pigeon, l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut garder les sommes qu\u2019Atlas lui a avanc\u00e9es pour le paiement de la taxe, me semblent non perti- nentes et je n\u2019exprime aucune opinion sur leur existence; il serait vain de le faire dans une affaire o\u00f9 Atlas n\u2019est pas partie.\nOn a pr\u00e9tendu, au cours des plaidoiries que, si nous d\u00e9cidions que le jugement du Juge Landreville ne fixe pas le sens \u00e0 donner du contrat, il s\u2019ensuivrait qu\u2019un ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire ou un administrateur ne pourrait faire sans risque la distribution d\u2019une succession imposable d\u2019apr\u00e8s un jugement d\u00e9finitif d\u2019un tribunal provincial interpr\u00e9tant un testament ou d\u00e9cidant sur une preuve contradictoire qui est l\u2019h\u00e9ritier l\u00e9gitime d\u2019un intestat, \u00e0 moins que le tr\u00e9sorier de la Province et le ministre du Revenu national n\u2019aient \u00e9t\u00e9 parties \u00e0 l\u2019instance o\u00f9 le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9. La validit\u00e9 de cet argument n\u2019est pas en cause ici mais il convient de s\u2019y arr\u00eater.\nJ\u2019en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, l\u2019incidence de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur les biens transmis par d\u00e9c\u00e8s et autres droits semblables d\u00e9pend du montant brut de la succession, des sommes transmises aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires et de leur lien de parent\u00e9 avec le d\u00e9funt. Ce sont l\u00e0 des questions qui doivent normalement \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9es par les tribunaux provinciaux selon les lois de la province et, exception faite d\u2019un jugement qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu par fraude ou collusion, il est difficile de supposer que le ministre charg\u00e9 de percevoir le revenu chercherait \u00e0 faire autrement que pr\u00e9lever les imp\u00f4ts exigibles de la succession selon sa r\u00e9partition, conform\u00e9ment au jugement de la Cour.\nD\u2019un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, dans la pr\u00e9sente cause l\u2019art. 10 du chapitre 12, Statuts du Canada 1963, 12 Eliz. II, cit\u00e9 dans les motifs de mon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Pigeon, cr\u00e9e en faveur du contribuable un droit extraordinaire de recouvrer de l\u2019argent de la Couronne advenant une condition explicitement d\u00e9finie. Si l\u2019on veut recouvrer certaines sommes de la Couronne en s\u2019appuyant sur cet article et si la r\u00e9alisation de la condition prescrite est mise en question, il semble \u00e9vident que la Couronne doit \u00eatre partie \u00e0 l\u2019instance o\u00f9 la question doit \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e.\nPassant \u00e0 la question de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du contrat, je suis d\u2019accord avec les motifs expos\u00e9s par le Juge Cattanach au sujet de la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle il serait arriv\u00e9 s\u2019il ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas senti li\u00e9 par le jugement du Juge Landreville, et plus particuli\u00e8rement avec la derni\u00e8re phrase du passage de ces motifs cit\u00e9 par mon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Pigeon:\n[TRADUCTION] Par cons\u00e9quent, il me para\u00eet clair que le texte pr\u00e9voit la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une taxe future qui sera mise \u00e0 la charge de l\u2019acheteur sous forme d\u2019augmentation du prix.\nTandis que le Juge Cattanach a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, par suite de ce qu\u2019il consid\u00e9rait comme son devoir de respect, d\u2019adopter la d\u00e9cision du Juge Landreville de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 sa propre opinion, il est clair que nous ne sommes aucunement li\u00e9s par le jugement du Juge Landreville. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9 mon opinion quant au sens v\u00e9ritable du contrat du 15 avril 1963.\nIl est \u00e9vident que le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019ensemble de toutes les proc\u00e9dures prises jusqu\u2019ici dans cette affaire laisse beaucoup \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer. La Cour Supr\u00eame de l\u2019Ontario, dans un jugement qui para\u00eet lier l\u2019intim\u00e9e mais ne lie pas Sa Majest\u00e9, a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 le contrat comme signifiant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne peut pas recouvrer la taxe d\u2019Atias. Cette Cour, en appel de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier et dans un jugement qui liera l\u2019intim\u00e9e mais qui ne para\u00eet par lier Atlas, interpr\u00e8te le contrat comme signifiant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut recouvrer la taxe d\u2019Atlas et, en cons\u00e9quence, ne peut pas obtenir un remboursement de Sa Majest\u00e9. Toutefois, les circonstances ne nous permettent pas de faire autrement que de prononcer un jugement interpr\u00e9tant le contrat comme il se lit.\nOn a dit, durant les plaidoiries, douter de l\u2019existence d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure par laquelle on aurait pu faire statuer les droits des trois parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, l\u2019appelante, l\u2019intim\u00e9e et Atlas, dans une seule instance o\u00f9 elles auraient toutes \u00e9t\u00e9 parties. Si une telle proc\u00e9dure existe, soit \u00e0 la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier ou \u00e0 la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de la province, on aurait d\u00fb y recourir; s\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune proc\u00e9dure de ce genre, je me permets de sugg\u00e9rer qu\u2019on devrait y pourvoir par une l\u00e9gislation appropri\u00e9e.\nAvant de terminer, je veux insister sur le fait que ma d\u00e9cision est seulement \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne peut recouvrer de l\u2019appelante le montant de la taxe. Afin d\u2019arriver \u00e0 ce r\u00e9sultat il a fallu d\u00e9cider entre l\u2019appelante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e que le sens v\u00e9ritable du contrat entre Atlas et l\u2019intim\u00e9e permet \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re de recouvrer d\u2019Atlas le montant de la taxe. Atlas n\u2019est pas partie \u00e0 cette instance et en cons\u00e9quence ce jugement ne sera pas d\u00e9cisif entre Atlas et l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nJe suis d\u2019avis de disposer du pourvoi comme le propose mon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Pigeon.\nLe jugement des Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson et Ritchie a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par\nLE JUGE JUDSON\u2014Je suis d\u2019accord avec la conclusion du Juge Pigeon que la Cour Supr\u00eame de l\u2019Ontario n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour lier la Couronne du chef du Canada dans cette affaire.\nLa Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise impose la taxe de consommation ou de vente sur le producteur ou fabricant. Lorsque le pr\u00e9sent contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 entre John Bertram et Atlas Steels, la mati\u00e8re du contrat (machines et appareils devant servir \u00e0 la fabrication ou production de marchandises) \u00e9tait exempt\u00e9e de la taxe de vente. Mais, le contrat pr\u00e9voyait en termes nets la transmission de la taxe de vente \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur. En cons\u00e9quence, lorsqu\u2019une loi a abrog\u00e9 l\u2019exemption en 1963, cette taxe, aux termes de ladite loi, devait \u00eatre pay\u00e9e par le fabricant. La responsabilit\u00e9 pour cette taxe \u00e9tait une question ne concernant que le contribuable et le ministre du Revenu national.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le ministre a demand\u00e9 le paiement de ces taxes et elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es sous prot\u00eat. Elles ne pouvaient \u00eatre recouvr\u00e9es que par une p\u00e9tition de droit en Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier. Cette Cour a une juridiction exclusive en premi\u00e8re instance pour toute affaire de ce genre, en vertu de l\u2019art. 18(1)(d) de la Loi sur la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier, qui se lit comme suit:\n18. (1) La Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a aussi juridiction exclusive en premi\u00e8re instance pour entendre et juger les mati\u00e8res suivantes:\n* * *\n(d) toute r\u00e9clamation contre la Couronne fond\u00e9e sur quelque loi du Canada ou sur quelque r\u00e8glement \u00e9dict\u00e9 par le gouverneur en conseil.\nDonc, il importe peu que le fabricant et l\u2019acheteur des machines n\u2019aient pas donn\u00e9 avis au ministre du Revenu national de leur demande \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame de l\u2019Ontario d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter le contrat et de d\u00e9terminer leurs droits. M\u00eame si un tel avis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9, le ministre aurait pu n\u2019en tenir aucun compte. Si cette somme n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e, il aurait pu intenter des poursuites en justice pour la recouvrer en vertu de l\u2019art. 50 de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise, qui se lit comme suit:\n50. (1) Toutes taxes ou sommes exigibles sous le r\u00e9gime de la pr\u00e9sente loi sont recouvrables \u00e0 toute \u00e9poque, pass\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de leur reddition de compte et de leur acquittement, et toutes ces taxes et sommes sont recouvrables, et tous les droits de Sa Majest\u00e9 s\u2019exercent en vertu des pr\u00e9sentes, avec obtention de tous les frais judiciaires, tout comme une dette envers Sa Majest\u00e9 ou un droit susceptible d\u2019\u00eatre exerc\u00e9 par Sa Majest\u00e9, devant la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier ou devant tout autre tribunal de juridiction comp\u00e9tente.\nDans ces poursuites, le choix du tribunal appartient au ministre. Quelle que soit la Cour qu\u2019il choisisse, elle a comp\u00e9tence, sauf appel, pour juger toute l\u2019affaire, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, savoir si le contrat permet l\u2019addition de la taxe \u00e0 la somme payable au fabricant.\nLes amendes pr\u00e9vues par la loi se trouvent \u00e0 l\u2019art. 50, para. (2):\n50. (2) Toute amende encourue pour une infraction quelconque des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente loi peut \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9e en justice et recouvr\u00e9e\n(a) devant la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier du Canada ou tout tribunal de juridiction comp\u00e9tente; ou\n(b) par voie de d\u00e9claration sommaire de culpabilit\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions du Code criminel y relatives.\nEncore une fois, le choix du tribunal appartient au ministre. Quelle que soit la Cour qu\u2019il choisisse pour le recouvrement de ces amendes, elle a la comp\u00e9tence exclusive, sauf appel, pour juger toute l\u2019affaire.\nDonc, le probl\u00e8me qui a inqui\u00e9t\u00e9 le Juge de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi de cette affaire n\u2019a jamais exist\u00e9 en r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Seule la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier avait comp\u00e9tence pour rendre une d\u00e9cision, sans \u00eatre entrav\u00e9e par le jugement d\u00e9claratoire de la Cour Supr\u00eame de l\u2019Ontario. J\u2019accueillerais le pourvoi et je rejetterais la p\u00e9tition de droit, avec d\u00e9pens ici et en Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier.\nLe jugement des Juges Hall, Spence et Pigeon a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par\nLE JUGE PIGEON\u2014Par sa p\u00e9tition de droit l\u2019intim\u00e9e r\u00e9clame le remboursement d\u2019une somme de $451,735.48 qu\u2019elle a pay\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de taxe de vente sur la vente d\u2019un laminoir \u00e0 chaud faite en vertu d\u2019un contrat par \u00e9crit en date du 15 avril 1963 \u00e0 un acheteur qui y est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme \u00abAtlas Steels Company, a division of Rio Algom Mines Ltd.\u00bb et que j\u2019appellerai \u00abAtlas\u00bb.\nA la date du contrat, le laminoir aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 exempt\u00e9 de la taxe de vente \u00e0 titre de machines ou appareils destin\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s dans la fabrication ou la production de marchandises au sens de l\u2019Annexe III de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise. Cependant, cette exemption a \u00e9t\u00e9 ensuite abrog\u00e9e par l\u2019art. 7 du chapitre 12 des lois de 1963. En vertu de l\u2019art. 8 cette abrogation a effet \u00e0 compter du 14 juin 1963. Toutefois, l\u2019art. 10 d\u00e9cr\u00e8te:\n10. (1) Lorsqu\u2019une taxe pr\u00e9vue par la Partie VI de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise est devenue payable par une personne \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de marchandises d\u00e9sign\u00e9es que celle-ci a, au plus tard le 31 d\u00e9cembre 1964, vendues et livr\u00e9es ou affect\u00e9es \u00e0 un usage qui en fait passer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre, en conformit\u00e9 d\u2019un v\u00e9ritable contrat par \u00e9crit\n(a) pr\u00e9voyant la vente de ces marchandises ou leur affectation \u00e0 un tel usage contre un montant forfaitaire \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans le contrat et ne permettant pas que la taxe soit ajout\u00e9e au montant payable \u00e0 cette personne en vertu du contrat, et\n(b) portant la signature des parties audit contrat, appos\u00e9e\n(i) le 13 juin 1963 ou avant cette date, \u2026\nil peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9 \u00e0 cette personne un remboursement de la taxe ou de la partie de celle-ci qui ne pouvait pas selon le contrat \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e au montant payable \u00e0 la personne en cause d\u2019apr\u00e8s ledit contrat, ou une d\u00e9duction de ladite taxe ou partie de taxe, pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e sur l\u2019une quelconque des taxes impos\u00e9es par ladite loi, si la personne en question en fait la demande au ministre du Revenu national, dans les deux ans qui suivent la date o\u00f9 les marchandises ont \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9es par cette personne ou affect\u00e9es par elle \u00e0 cet usage. Dans le contrat avec Atlas, sous le titre \u00abPrice Adjustment\u00bb on trouve la clause 18 comme suit:\n[TRADUCTION] Le prix du laminoir fera l\u2019objet des ajustements suivants:\n(a) le montant de toute taxe de vente f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou provinciale impos\u00e9e par la loi; \u2026\nEn date du 31 d\u00e9cembre 1964 une convention sous forme de lettre fut sign\u00e9e par Atlas, adress\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e et accept\u00e9e par celle-ci dans les termes suivants:\n[TRADUCTION] Nous accusons r\u00e9ception de votre facture en date du 31 d\u00e9cembre 1964 pour le versement de $4,250,000 d\u00fb ce jour en vertu de notre contrat du 15 avril 1963 (tel que modifi\u00e9) pour l\u2019achat d\u2019un laminoir \u00e0 chaud.

Il est entendu et convenu que nous aurons le droit de r\u00e9clamer en justice l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de nos droits et obligations respectifs d\u00e9coulant du contrat du 15 avril 1963 tel que modifi\u00e9.\nIl est de plus entendu et convenu qu\u2019\u00e0 notre demande et \u00e0 nos frais vous aurez recours ou participerez \u00e0 toutes proc\u00e9dures judiciaires que nous pourrons juger opportunes pour obtenir une interpr\u00e9tation d\u00e9finitive en justice des dispositions du contrat susdit concernant l\u2019obligation de payer la taxe de vente f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 toutes autres actions qui pourront \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaires pour obtenir le remboursement de cette taxe de vente f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Si l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation ainsi obtenue a pour r\u00e9sultat le remboursement de la taxe de vente sur le susdit contrat vous nous rembourserez promptement sur r\u00e9ception ladite somme de $340,000 ou la partie que vous en aurez re\u00e7ue ainsi que toutes autres sommes qui pourront ult\u00e9rieurement nous devenir payables de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re au sujet dudit contrat avec l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sur ces montants s\u2019il vous est pay\u00e9.\nConform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cette convention sous forme de lettre, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fit en janvier 1965 un premier paiement de taxe de vente au montant de $340,000. En date du 29 janvier 1965 elle adressa au minist\u00e8re du Revenu national une lettre d\u00e9clarant que cette somme \u00e9tait pay\u00e9e sous prot\u00eat, que les procureurs d\u2019Atlas avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s par le minist\u00e8re que le contrat ne donnait pas droit au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019art. 10 de la loi de 1963 et que:\n[TRADUCTION] On a l\u2019intention de requ\u00e9rir des tribunaux de l\u2019Ontario une interpr\u00e9tation du contrat pour savoir s\u2019il donne \u00e0 notre compagnie le droit de faire supporter par Atlas Steels Company le fardeau de la taxe de vente impos\u00e9e par l\u2019amendement apport\u00e9 \u00e0 la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise \u00e0 compter du 13 juin 1963. Si le r\u00e9sultat de cette interpr\u00e9tation est que nous n\u2019avons pas le droit d\u2019exiger ce paiement d\u2019Atlas Steels Company, nous nous proposons de demander au minist\u00e8re de nous rembourser le susdit montant de $340,000 de m\u00eame que toute autre somme per\u00e7ue de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re d\u2019Atlas Steels Company en vertu du m\u00eame contrat.\nEn juin 1965, sans avis au minist\u00e8re, les avocats d\u2019Atlas pr\u00e9sent\u00e8rent \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame de l\u2019Ontario, en pr\u00e9sence de ceux de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, une requ\u00eate demandant un jugement d\u00e9clarato\u00efre des droits des parties au contrat du 15 avril 1963. La d\u00e9claration sous serment annex\u00e9e \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate ne fait mention d\u2019aucune autre pi\u00e8ce et rien autre chose qu\u2019une copie de cet acte ne para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 produit. Le 2 juillet 1965, le juge Landreville rendit un jugement d\u00e9clarant l\u2019intim\u00e9e seule tenue de payer la taxe de vente. Dans les motifs donn\u00e9s par \u00e9crit \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette d\u00e9cision, l\u2019essentiel est ce qui suit:\n[TRADUCTION] Le contrat entre les parties est au dossier. Les clauses pertinentes sont num\u00e9rot\u00e9es 15, 17 et 18. \u2026 Ayant lu le contrat entier et sp\u00e9cialement les clauses susmentionn\u00e9es, je suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le contrat, tout en faisant mention de la taxe de vente, ne dit pas clairement et explicitement qui doit la payer. La loi subs\u00e9quente imposant au manufacturier l\u2019obligation de payer la taxe, je ne trouve pas dans le contrat le texte clair qu\u2019il faudrait pour d\u00e9placer cette obligation et la reporter sur l\u2019acheteur.\nJ\u2019accepte l\u2019argument de la requ\u00e9rante \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019expression \u00abimpos\u00e9e par la loi\u00bb se rapporte et a trait \u00e0 la taxe qui pouvait alors exister. Il appert que les marchandises en question pouvaient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es exemptes de taxe \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque du contrat.\nApr\u00e8s ce jugement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e paya sous prot\u00eat des montants additionnels pour taxe de vente comme suit:\nLe 29 juillet 1965 ........................................\n$64,770.65\nLe 21 avril 1966...........................................\n$46,964.83\nUne lettre de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en date du 16 septembre 1965 fait voir que le paiement de juillet avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait sur des fonds vers\u00e9s par Atlas. Rien ne d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il en ait \u00e9t\u00e9 autrement pour le paiement d\u2019avril 1966.\nLa demande de remboursement ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e, une p\u00e9tition de droit fut produite le 27 janvier 1967. A l\u2019enqu\u00eate, on produisit une admission de faits ne contenant vraiment rien de plus que le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 que je viens de faire.\nLe juge Cattanach accueillit la p\u00e9tition seulement parce qu\u2019il se consid\u00e9rait oblig\u00e9 de suivre la d\u00e9cision d\u2019une autre cour de juridiction \u00e9gale ou \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 moins d\u2019une raison grave. Il indiqua ce qu\u2019il entendait par une raison grave en citant le passage suivant des motifs du juge en chef McRuer dans Rex v. Northern Electric Co.[3]:\n[TRADUCTION] A mon avis une raison grave \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un jugement ne signifie pas un argument qui semble puissant aux yeux d\u2019un juge en particulier mais quelque chose qui indique que la d\u00e9cision dont il s\u2019agit a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue sans tenir compte d\u2019une loi ou d\u2019un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre suivi. Je ne crois pas que l\u2019on doive consid\u00e9rer qu\u2019une raison est grave en ce sens simplement d\u2019apr\u00e8s la mani\u00e8re de voir personnelle du juge. Le juge Cattanach indiqua clairement que sa conclusion \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e uniquement sur sa conception du respect des d\u00e9cisions judiciaires en d\u00e9clarant:\n[TRADUCTION] \u2026 Je dois dire que si l\u2019affaire \u00e9tait venue devant moi \u00e0 l\u2019origine, sans le jugement du juge Landreville, j\u2019aurais conclu autrement qu\u2019il l\u2019a fait. Tenant compte de l\u2019ensemble du contrat et de ce que je consid\u00e8re comme le vrai sens clair du texte de la clause 18 paragraphe (a), j\u2019aurais jug\u00e9 que les parties entendaient que toute taxe de vente f\u00e9d\u00e9rale impos\u00e9e par la loi donne lieu \u00e0 un ajustement du prix \u00e0 la charge de l\u2019acheteur.\n* * *\nJe ne puis admettre, comme le juge Landreville l\u2019a fait, que l\u2019expression \u00abimpos\u00e9e par la loi\u00bb se rapporte et ait trait \u00e0 la taxe qui pouvait alors exister: premi\u00e8rement, parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas alors de taxe de vente f\u00e9d\u00e9rale impos\u00e9e par la loi, deuxi\u00e8mement, parce que les mots \u00abimpos\u00e9e par la loi\u00bb sont form\u00e9s d\u2019un participe employ\u00e9 comme adjectif pour qualifier \u00abtaxe\u00bb, troisi\u00e8mement, \u00e0 cause de l\u2019addition du mot \u00abtoute\u00bb. Par cons\u00e9quent, il me para\u00eet clair que le texte pr\u00e9voit la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une taxe future qui sera mise \u00e0 la charge de l\u2019acheteur sous forme d\u2019augmentation du prix.\nOn voit donc que le pourvoi nous met en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une situation inusit\u00e9e: le juge de premi\u00e8re instance fait lui-m\u00eame une argumentation tr\u00e8s solide et persuasive \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle il s\u2019est finalement arr\u00eat\u00e9 par suite de ce qu\u2019il consid\u00e9rait comme son devoir de respect envers un jugement d\u2019une autre cour de juridiction \u00e9gale ou \u00e9quivalente. Vu l\u2019importance de cette question, une r\u00e9audition devant le tribunal au complet a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9e.\nEn consid\u00e9rant quelle valeur il faut donner au jugement du juge Landreville, il convient de rechercher d\u2019abord si l\u2019affaire \u00e9tait de sa comp\u00e9tence. Il est s\u00fbr qu\u2019en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le tribunal comp\u00e9tent pour statuer sur les droits de citoyens parties \u00e0 un contrat c\u2019est la cour sup\u00e9rieure de leur province. En v\u00e9rit\u00e9, l\u2019arr\u00eat de cette Cour dans Consolidated Distilleries Ltd. c. Consolidated Exporters Corp. Ltd.[4], d\u00e9montre que la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier n\u2019a pas en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral juridiction pour statuer sur des r\u00e9clamations de citoyens entre eux parce que dans l\u2019article 101 de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9- rique du Nord britannique l\u2019expression \u00abloi du Canada\u00bb d\u00e9signe uniquement des lois de la comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada.\nCependant, lorsque l\u2019on scrute les faits de la pr\u00e9sente cause, on constate que la question soulev\u00e9e par la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame de l\u2019Ontario ne visait pas vraiment les droits des parties entre elles mais uniquement leur r\u00e9clamation contre Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada. En effet, les droits des parties \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate entre elles n\u2019\u00e9taient plus ce qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient apr\u00e8s la signature du contrat primitif. Elles avaient fait une autre convention par l\u2019effet de laquelle il n\u2019y avait plus de diff\u00e9rend entre elles sur l\u2019incidence du fardeau de la nouvelle taxe de vente. Par cette nouvelle convention tout doute sur le droit pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e de recouvrer d\u2019Atlas la taxe de vente avait disparu. Atlas s\u2019\u00e9tait m\u00eame oblig\u00e9e \u00e0 fournir l\u2019argent pour l\u2019acquitter. Parce que les droits des parties n\u2019\u00e9taient plus r\u00e9gis par le contrat primitif mais par la convention subs\u00e9quente Atlas, en juillet 1965, fournit encore de l\u2019argent pour payer la taxe de vente malgr\u00e9 le jugement d\u00e9clarant qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenue de la payer. Notons aussi que par l\u2019effet de la convention sous forme de lettre c\u2019est pour Atlas et non pour elle-m\u00eame que l\u2019intim\u00e9e r\u00e9clame aujourd\u2019hui.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, si l\u2019on examine la question soumise \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame de l\u2019Ontario \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de tous les faits pertinents y compris ceux qui ne lui ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s, on s\u2019aper\u00e7oit que, par suite de la disposition relative au remboursement ins\u00e9r\u00e9e dans la loi de 1963, le v\u00e9ritable objet de la requ\u00eate n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de faire d\u00e9cider si l\u2019une des parties avait droit de recouvrer de l\u2019autre la taxe de vente mais bien de faire juger si l\u2019une d\u2019elles avait droit de la recouvrer du gouvernement du Canada au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019autre. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vraiment un proc\u00e8s entre citoyens mais bien une demande d\u2019une opinion destin\u00e9e \u00e0 servir de base \u00e0 une r\u00e9clamation contre la Couronne dans une situation o\u00f9 cette opinion devait \u00eatre d\u00e9cisive en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e parce que l\u2019existence des autres conditions requises n\u2019\u00e9tait pas contest\u00e9e. Dans ces circonstances, la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019une telle opinion n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de la comp\u00e9tence de la Cour Supr\u00eame de l\u2019Ontario par l\u2019effet de l\u2019alin\u00e9a d du par. 1 de l\u2019art. 18 de la Loi sur la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier, S.R.C. 1952, c. 98: 18. (1) La Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a aussi juridiction exclusive en premi\u00e8re instance pour entendre et juger les mati\u00e8res suivantes:\n* * *\n(d) toute r\u00e9clamation contre la Couronne fond\u00e9e sur quelque loi du Canada ou sur quelque r\u00e8glement \u00e9dict\u00e9 par le gouverneur en conseil;\nIl convient de signaler que la requ\u00eate \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame de l\u2019Ontario fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e sans avis au minist\u00e8re du Revenu national. La lettre du 29 janvier 1965 ne peut aucunement \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme l\u2019\u00e9quivalent d\u2019un avis formel car le minist\u00e8re \u00e9tait seulement inform\u00e9 par l\u00e0 de l\u2019intention d\u2019intenter des proc\u00e9dures, non des proc\u00e9dures elles-m\u00eames. Les fonctionnaires n\u2019\u00e9taient s\u00fbrement pas tenus de chercher \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir si l\u2019on donnerait suite \u00e0 l\u2019intention qu\u2019on leur faisait ainsi conna\u00eetre. Aucun avis n\u2019ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9, il est clair que le d\u00e9faut de comp\u00e9tence peut \u00eatre soulev\u00e9 en la pr\u00e9sente instance. Cela ne veut pas dire qu\u2019il en serait autrement si un avis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 et laisse enti\u00e8re la question de savoir si l\u2019on peut ou doit donner avis de proc\u00e9dures entre citoyens susceptibles d\u2019avoir une incidence sur les droits de la Couronne.\nL\u2019audition devant le Juge Landreville n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une telle proc\u00e9dure. Elle n\u2019avait que les apparences d\u2019un litige entre citoyens. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, par suite de la convention sous forme de lettre du 31 d\u00e9cembre 1964, les avocats des deux parties repr\u00e9sentaient les m\u00eames int\u00e9r\u00eats, ceux d\u2019Atlas. La partie adverse, la Couronne, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. M\u00eame l\u2019adjudication des d\u00e9pens \u00e9tait purement illusoire, par suite de la convention c\u2019est Atlas qui devait les supporter sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 ce que le juge pouvait d\u00e9cider. Le fait d\u2019avoir inform\u00e9 le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019intention de requ\u00e9rir de la Cour Supr\u00eame de l\u2019Ontario une interpr\u00e9tation du contrat primitif semble indiquer que les parties croyaient que, malgr\u00e9 leur convention ult\u00e9rieure, c\u2019\u00e9tait le tribunal comp\u00e9tent. Si tel est le cas, elles \u00e9taient dans l\u2019erreur. A ce moment-l\u00e0, le seul litige \u00e9tait non entre les parties mais avec le gouvernement, par cons\u00e9quent l\u2019affaire \u00e9tait de la comp\u00e9tence exclusive de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier.\nAu cours de l\u2019audition devant cette Cour, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelante, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question d\u2019un juge, a dit qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que les proc\u00e9dures devant le Juge Landreville avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises ou men\u00e9es de mauvaise foi. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9 une des raisons de croire qu\u2019on \u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement de bonne foi. Je ne pense pas cependant que cela soit de quelque utilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Pour d\u00e9terminer les effets juridiques d\u2019un acte, il faut en rechercher la nature. La forme des conventions n\u2019emp\u00eache pas la Cour de d\u00e9terminer la nature r\u00e9elle de l\u2019acte: Monarch Securities Ltd. v. Gold[5], Mass v. Pepper[6].\nSi l\u2019on applique ce principe \u00e0 la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Juge Landreville, la conclusion qui s\u2019impose est que l\u2019objet v\u00e9ritable n\u2019en \u00e9tait pas une adjudication sur les droits des parties entre elles. Le seul but \u00e9tait d\u2019obtenir une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 la Couronne en faveur d\u2019Atlas; l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait demanderesse que nominalement et agissait comme agent ou fiduciaire pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d\u2019Atlas.\nDans ces circonstances, je ne crois pas qu\u2019on puisse consid\u00e9rer Atlas comme \u00e9trang\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019affaire. Elle se trouve dans la m\u00eame situation qu\u2019une personne pour l\u2019avantage de laquelle un tiers intente une poursuite. Dans l\u2019affaire Gough v. Toronto and York Radial R.W. Co.[7], le Juge Middleton, dans un jugement unanimement confirm\u00e9 en appel, dit:\n[TRADUCTION] Quand une compagnie d\u2019assurances intente une poursuite au nom de l\u2019assur\u00e9, il ne fait pas de doute que celui-ci n\u2019est que nominalement demandeur: on peut au besoin exiger de lui un cautionnement pour frais, de plus la compagnie d\u2019assurances est une personne au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de laquelle l\u2019action est intent\u00e9e et, par cons\u00e9quent il y a lieu contre elle \u00e0 l\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable.\nDans l\u2019affaire Deisler c. U.S. Fidelity Co.[8], le Juge Duff (alors Juge pu\u00een\u00e9) a dit (\u00e0 la p. 1053):\n[TRADUCTION] On l\u2019admet, la preuve de l\u2019avis de cession n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. En cons\u00e9quence, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le droit \u00e9crit de la Colombie-Britannique, la cession n\u2019est pas parfaite en tant que cession statutaire, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que l\u2019objet de la r\u00e9clamation n\u2019est pas pass\u00e9 au cessionnaire d\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi. Si l\u2019on consid\u00e8re le transport comme une cession en \u00e9quit\u00e9, l\u2019absence du cessionnaire, vu que la poursuite est intent\u00e9e au nom du c\u00e9dant, ne constitue pas une d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l\u2019action mais seulement un motif pour le d\u00e9fendeur de se servir du cessionnaire pour se prot\u00e9ger. Le c\u00e9dant agissant \u00e0 titre de fiduciaire du cessionnaire en vertu du transport en \u00e9quit\u00e9, l\u2019objet du droit d\u2019action en droit strict appartient au c\u00e9dant, qui en est le d\u00e9tenteur en droit.\nA mon avis, il faut consid\u00e9rer Atlas comme la demanderesse r\u00e9elle dansl\u2019action contre Sa Majest\u00e9, et comme ayant demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame de l\u2019Ontario une d\u00e9cision destin\u00e9e \u00e0 servir de base \u00e0 sa r\u00e9clamation. Comme cette d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait une partie int\u00e9grante du processus de l\u2019adjudication sur sa r\u00e9clamation, c\u2019est la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier qui avait juridiction exclusive pour juger de ce fait-l\u00e0 de m\u00eame que de tous les autres faits dont d\u00e9pendait la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019affaire en premi\u00e8re instance.\nEn \u00e9tant venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le Juge Landreville n\u2019avait pas juridiction en l\u2019occurrence, il s\u2019ensuit que la pr\u00e9sente cause doit \u00eatre jug\u00e9e sans tenir compte du jugement qu\u2019il a rendu. A mon avis, l\u2019opinion du Juge Cattanach sur la conclusion \u00e0 tirer dans cette alternative est parfaitement exacte.\nPour ces raisons, je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir l\u2019appel et de rejeter la p\u00e9tition de droit de l\u2019intim\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens dans les deux cours.\nAppel accueilli avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureur de l\u2019appelant: D.S.

Le demandeur a conduit le bateau jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 ils se sont arr\u00eat\u00e9s pour d\u00e9jeuner. Quand ils sont repartis, l\u2019\u00e9pouse du demandeur a pris les commandes. A l\u2019approche d\u2019un barrage, ils projetaient de passer par l\u2019\u00e9cluse. Rendus tout pr\u00e8s, ils ont bien vu que l\u2019\u00e9cluse n\u2019\u00e9tait pas ouverte \u00e0 la navigation. En fait, la rivi\u00e8re n\u2019\u00e9tait pas encore ouverte \u00e0 la navigation. L\u2019\u00e9pouse du demandeur a alors fait demi-tour et remont\u00e9 le courant dans l\u2019intention de retourner \u00e0 Winnipeg. Le demandeur a alors regard\u00e9 en aval, vu que les rideaux du barrage \u00e9taient tous relev\u00e9s. Il n\u2019y avait plus d\u2019\u00e9criteaux \u00e0 la bou\u00e9e signalant l\u2019existence de la chute. Ces \u00e9criteaux avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9s par les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de la Couronne, avaient apparemment \u00e9t\u00e9 emport\u00e9s par la crue des eaux et n\u2019avaient pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9s. Le demandeur a cru alors que le niveau de l\u2019eau \u00e9tait le m\u00eame des deux c\u00f4t\u00e9s du barrage. Il n\u2019a pu distinguer aucune chute; par contre, il a constat\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait plusieurs personnes qui se promenaient et qui p\u00eachaient dans de petites embarcations de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 du pont. De tout cela, il a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de danger \u00e0 passer sous le pont et il a dit \u00e0 sa femme de le faire. Lorsque le bateau a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 environ 50 pieds du barrage, la d\u00e9nivellation est devenue clairement visible et le bruit de la chute, tr\u00e8s audible. Le courant a entra\u00een\u00e9 le bateau par dessus le barrage, il s\u2019est empli d\u2019eau et a chavir\u00e9. L\u2019\u00e9pouse du demandeur s\u2019est noy\u00e9e. La Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a rejet\u00e9 la p\u00e9tition de droit du demandeur r\u00e9clamant des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Le demandeur en appela \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre accueilli, les Juges Abbott et Ritchie \u00e9tant dissidents.\nLe Juge en Chef Cartwright: L\u2019omission de la part des employ\u00e9s de la Couronne de remplacer les panneaux de signalisation \u00e9tait une n\u00e9gligence et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause efficiente du d\u00e9sastre. Cette n\u00e9gligence a contribu\u00e9 effectivement \u00e0 amener le demandeur et son \u00e9pouse dans une voie p\u00e9rilleuse qu\u2019ils auraient autrement \u00e9vit\u00e9e. La n\u00e9gligence de leur part en manquant d\u2019apercevoir et appr\u00e9cier le danger un peu plus t\u00f4t qu\u2019ils ne l\u2019ont fait ne permet pas de leur imputer toute la responsabilit\u00e9.\nLes Juges Hall et Spence: Les faits de cette cause motivent l\u2019imputation \u00e0 parts \u00e9gales de la n\u00e9gligence au demandeur et \u00e0 la Couronne. L\u2019inattention du demandeur et de son \u00e9pouse et leur d\u00e9faut de garder la ma\u00eetrise du bateau au cours du trajet depuis le point o\u00f9 ils ont fait demi-tour jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019instant o\u00f9 ils ont compris trop tard le danger constituent une n\u00e9gligence qui leur est imputable. L\u2019omission de remplacer les \u00e9criteaux de signalisation qui a amen\u00e9 le demandeur \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter ce qui s\u2019est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 une man\u0153uvre funeste et qui lui a fait croire que son \u00e9pouse pouvait passer sous le pont sans danger constitue une n\u00e9gligence qui est imputable \u00e0 la Couronne. La n\u00e9gligence des deux parties a contribu\u00e9 simultan\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019accident.\nLes Juges Abbott et Ritchie, dissidents: L\u2019omission du demandeur et de son \u00e9pouse de veiller \u00e0 leur propre s\u00e9curit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 le facteur d\u00e9terminant du malheur qui leur est arriv\u00e9. L\u2019absence des \u00e9criteaux de signalisation sur la bou\u00e9e n\u2019a pas contribu\u00e9 en elle-m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019accident, ce dernier r\u00e9sultant uniquement des actes du demandeur et de son \u00e9pouse. Leur conduite n\u00e9gligente est distincte de toute n\u00e9gligence imputable \u00e0 la Couronne et elle est post\u00e9rieure. En dirigeant comme ils l\u2019ont fait leur embarcation de plaisance, ils auraient d\u00fb pr\u00e9voir l\u2019accident qui est survenu.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement du Juge Cattanach de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier du Canada, rejetant la r\u00e9clamation du demandeur soumise par voie de p\u00e9tition de droit. Appel accueilli, les Juges Abbott et Ritchie \u00e9tant dissidents.\nD\u2019A.C.H. McCaffrey et J.F. O\u2019Sullivan, pour le demandeur, appelant.\nDerek H. Aylen et Robert W. Law, pour la d\u00e9fenderesse, intim\u00e9e.\nLE JUGE EN CHEF\u2014Mes coll\u00e8gues les Juges Ritchie et Spence ont r\u00e9sum\u00e9 les faits pertinents dans leurs motifs de jugement, motifs que j\u2019ai eu le privil\u00e8ge de lire.\nJe suis d\u2019accord avec mon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Spence et d\u00e9sire cependant ajouter quelques mots.\nA mon avis, les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avaient aucun motif ou excuse l\u00e9gitime de ne pas remplacer les panneaux de signalisation portant les mots \u00abDanger\u2014Falls Ahead\u00bb; cette omission \u00e9tait une n\u00e9gligence et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause efficiente du d\u00e9sastre qui est survenu. Ma conclusion \u00e0 ce sujet est fond\u00e9e sur les motifs donn\u00e9s par mon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Spence, auxquels je ne vois rien \u00e0 ajouter.\nNi mon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Ritchie ni le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019ont cru n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y avait eu une n\u00e9gligence imputable \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, vu qu\u2019\u00e0 leur avis, m\u00eame s\u2019il en \u00e9tait ainsi, celle de l\u2019appelant et de son \u00e9pouse d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e \u00e9tait la seule cause imm\u00e9diate de l\u2019accident. Je ne puis accepter cette mani\u00e8re de voir. Il me para\u00eet qu\u2019ici la n\u00e9gligence dont l\u2019intim\u00e9e est responsable a contribu\u00e9 effectivement \u00e0 amener l\u2019appelant et son \u00e9pouse dans une voie p\u00e9rilleuse qu\u2019ils auraient autrement \u00e9vit\u00e9e. Je conviens qu\u2019il y a eu n\u00e9gligence de leur part en manquant d\u2019apercevoir et appr\u00e9cier le danger un peu plus t\u00f4t qu\u2019ils ne l\u2019ont fait, mais cette n\u00e9gligence ne permet pas, \u00e0 mon avis, de leur imputer toute la responsabilit\u00e9. Il faut tenir compte, dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du comportement qu\u2019on leur reproche, du fait qu\u2019ils se trouvaient en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un danger imminent, o\u00f9 la n\u00e9gligence imputable \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e les avait conduits.\nJe disposerais du pourvoi de la fa\u00e7on que le propose mon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Spence. Le jugement des Juges Abbott et Ritchie fut rendu par\nLE JUGE RITCHIE (dissident)\u2014Le pourvoi est \u00e0 I\u2019encontre d\u2019un jugement de M. Le Juge Cattanach de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier du Canada par lequel ce dernier rejette la r\u00e9clamation du p\u00e9titionnaire soumise par voie de p\u00e9tition de droit, fond\u00e9e pr\u00e9tendument, sur les dispositions de la Loi sur la responsabilit\u00e9 de la Couronne, 1952-1953 (Can.), c. 30, la loi dite The Trustee Act du Manitoba, S.R.M. 1954, c. 273 et la loi dite The Fatal Accidents Act de cette m\u00eame province, S.R.M. 1954, c. 84.\nDans sa p\u00e9tition, qu\u2019il pr\u00e9sente en qualit\u00e9 d\u2019administrateur de la succession de feu sa femme, Irene May Hendricks, Egan Hendricks r\u00e9clame aux titres suivants: en vertu de The Trustee Act, le montant des frais fun\u00e9raires de sa femme, la perte de son bateau et des dommages g\u00e9n\u00e9raux; pour lui-m\u00eame et pour sa fille, en vertu de The Fatal Accidents Act, des dommages g\u00e9n\u00e9raux r\u00e9sultant du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de sa femme par suite d\u2019un accident o\u00f9 le bateau de M. Hendricks, alors conduit par sa femme, a saut\u00e9 la chute \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9cluse St. Andrew\u2019s \u00e0 Lockport, province du Manitoba, le 19 juin 1966.\nOn ne nie pas que le barrage de Lockport et l\u2019\u00e9cluse St. Andrews sont des ouvrages publics dont le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics a l\u2019administration, la charge et la gestion. On trouve \u00e0 ce sujet un arr\u00eat\u00e9 du Conseil priv\u00e9, du 29 d\u00e9cembre 1949 (C.P. 6514), intitul\u00e9: R\u00e8glements pour l\u2019utilisation et l\u2019exploitation de l\u2019\u00e9cluse St. Andrews, rivi\u00e8re Rouge, Manitoba. En contre\u2011interrogatoire M. Hendricks a finalement admis qu\u2019il connaissait bien cet arr\u00eat\u00e9 qui d\u00e9cr\u00e8te, notamment:\n2. (g) \u00absaison de navigation\u00bb signifie la p\u00e9riode comprise entre l\u2019ouverture et la fermeture de l\u2019\u00e9cluse \u00e0 la circulation.\n4. L\u2019\u00e9cluse sera ouverte jour et nuit pendant la saison de navigation, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019\u00e0 certaines \u00e9poques, des dispositions contraires ne soient prises par les autorit\u00e9s comp\u00e9tentes.\n17. (1) Il incombe au capitaine ou \u00e0 la personne qui a la charge du navire, lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019approche d\u2019une \u00e9cluse ou d\u2019un pont, de s\u2019assurer si cette \u00e9cluse ou ce pont est pr\u00eat \u00e0 laisser entrer ou passer son navire, et il doit r\u00e9duire la vitesse de son navire assez t\u00f4t pour \u00e9viter toute collision avec l\u2019\u00e9cluse ou ses portes ou avec le pont ou les autres ouvrages.\nLes italiques sont de moi.\nJe crois qu\u2019il faut tenir que la digue dormante qui se trouve pr\u00e8s de l\u2019\u00e9cluse et dont il sera question plus loin tombe dans la cat\u00e9gorie d\u00e9sign\u00e9e par l\u2019expression \u00abautres ouvrages\u00bb employ\u00e9e dans l\u2019article que je viens de citer, et qu\u2019il faut consid\u00e9rer que le bateau d\u2019Hendricks est venu en collision avec la digue, en sautant la chute qu\u2019elle produit. Je crois aussi que la preuve montre clairement que bien que les Hendricks aient connu les r\u00e8glements qui viennent d\u2019\u00eatre cit\u00e9s, ils ne les ont pas du tout observ\u00e9s. Quoiqu\u2019ils aient su que l\u2019\u00e9cluse \u00e9tait \u00e0 sec, ils n\u2019ont pas compris que la saison de navigation n\u2019\u00e9tait pas encore ouverte et ils n\u2019ont pas cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9duire la vitesse de leur embarcation assez t\u00f4t pour \u00e9viter d\u2019entrer en collision avec la digue.\nM. Hendricks et sa femme \u00e9taient des fervents du club nautique Redboyne. Cette association \u00e9tait form\u00e9e de personnes qui s\u2019adonnaient \u00e0 la navigation de plaisance sur la rivi\u00e8re Rouge et elle donnait \u00e0 ses membres, dont les Hendricks, tous les renseignements au sujet de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sur l\u2019eau et des conditions de navigation sur la rivi\u00e8re Rouge de m\u00eame que des conseils sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans le maniement des petites embarcations. La rivi\u00e8re Rouge \u00e9tait bien connue des Hendricks, de m\u00eame que le barrage de Lockport et la d\u00e9nivellation de cinq pieds qu\u2019il produisait dans la rivi\u00e8re et qui cr\u00e9ait la chute o\u00f9 l\u2019accident est survenu.\nM. et Mme Hendricks avaient une petite embarcation depuis environ sept ans. A l\u2019automne 1965, ils s\u2019\u00e9taient achet\u00e9 un bateau en fibre de verre, de 19 pieds de longueur et de sept pieds de bau, \u00e9quip\u00e9 d\u2019un moteur hors-bord de 90 chevaux-vapeur. C\u2019est dans ce bateau qu\u2019en compagnie d\u2019un ami nomm\u00e9 John Atkinson, ils sont partis du quai du club nautique Redboyne le 19 juin 1966, emportant leur repas et de la bi\u00e8re, avec l\u2019intention de se promener sur la rivi\u00e8re jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Selkirk, au nord du barrage de Lockport. M. Hendricks a conduit le bateau jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 ils se sont arr\u00eat\u00e9s pour d\u00e9jeuner. C\u2019est Mme Hendricks qui a pris les commandes quand ils sont repartis. M. Hendricks et son ami M. Atkinson se sont assis \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re du bateau, tourn\u00e9s vers la poupe.\nA Lockport, le barrage, ainsi qu\u2019on l\u2019appelle, se compose d\u2019un pont soutenu par cinq gros piliers de b\u00e9ton entre chacun desquels il y a une vanne m\u00e9tallique munie d\u2019un rideau de bois. Ce rideau fonctionne \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s comme un store japonais. Quand la vanne est abaiss\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 s\u2019appuyer sur le sommet de la digue en b\u00e9ton qui est construite pour la recevoir, et que le rideau de bois est ferm\u00e9, l\u2019eau de la rivi\u00e8re se trouve retenue et le barrage fait monter le niveau de l\u2019eau de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 permettre aux embarcations de franchir les rapides Lister et il rend la rivi\u00e8re navigable entre Lockport et Winnipeg, qui se trouve \u00e0 environ 15 milles au sud. M\u00eame si les vannes ne sont pas abaiss\u00e9es, la digue dormante cr\u00e9e par elle-m\u00eame une petite chute d\u2019environ cinq pieds de hauteur ce qui \u00e9tait connu des deux \u00e9poux Hendricks.\nLorsqu\u2019on estime \u00e0 10,300 pieds cubes \u00e0 la seconde le d\u00e9bit de la rivi\u00e8re Rouge au pont Redwood, dans la ville de Winnipeg, soit ordinairement au d\u00e9but de juin, on abaisse les vannes du barrage \u00e0 Lockport et on ferme les rideaux de bois. L\u2019\u00e9cluse situ\u00e9e tout pr\u00e8s du barrage, juste \u00e0 l\u2019ouest, commence \u00e0 fonctionner et il devient possible de naviguer sur la rivi\u00e8re au-del\u00e0 du barrage. La rivi\u00e8re est alors d\u00e9clar\u00e9e ouverte \u00e0 la navigation. En 1966, cela n\u2019eut pas lieu avant le 20 juin. Le jour de l\u2019accident, les vannes m\u00e9talliques \u00e9taient encore relev\u00e9es et le barrage ne retenait aucunement le d\u00e9bit de la rivi\u00e8re. De m\u00eame, le canal de l\u2019\u00e9cluse \u00e9tait \u00e0 sec et il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident que celle-ci ne fonctionnait pas.\nIl ne faut pas oublier que les Hendricks doivent tous deux \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s au courant des r\u00e8glements de la navigation sur la rivi\u00e8re et lorsqu\u2019ils se sont approch\u00e9s du barrage, ont constat\u00e9 que les rideaux \u00e9taient relev\u00e9s et que l\u2019\u00e9cluse \u00e9tait vide, ils auraient d\u00fb savoir que la rivi\u00e8re n\u2019\u00e9tait pas encore ouverte \u00e0 la navigation.\nBien qu\u2019ils aient emprunt\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9cluse \u00e0 plusieurs reprises et aient vu la chute au moins six fois, les Hendricks semblent avoir pens\u00e9 que le niveau de la rivi\u00e8re avait suffisamment mont\u00e9 pour leur permettre de passer en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sous les rideaux ouverts du pont sans rencontrer la d\u00e9nivellation de cinq pieds.\nIl faut dire ici que les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s du minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics, responsables de l\u2019administration du barrage de Lockport, avaient l\u2019habitude de mettre une bou\u00e9e \u00e0 une faible distance au sud du barrage, soit un peu au sud du prolongement du c\u00f4t\u00e9 est du canal qui conduit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cluse. Il y avait normalement deux \u00e9criteaux blancs en bois, fix\u00e9s \u00e0 la bou\u00e9e, \u00e0 angle droit l\u2019un par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019autre, portant l\u2019inscription suivante \u00e0 la peinture rouge: \u00abDanger\u2014Falls Ahead\u00bb. Cependant au cours du printemps de 1966, la crue des eaux a submerg\u00e9 la bou\u00e9e et emport\u00e9 les \u00e9criteaux. Ils n\u2019avaient pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9s le 19 juin 1966.\nA l\u2019approche du barrage, les Hendricks projetaient de passer par l\u2019\u00e9cluse. Rendus tout pr\u00e8s, ils ont bien vu que le canal de l\u2019\u00e9cluse \u00e9tait impraticable et que celle-ci n\u2019\u00e9tait pas ouverte \u00e0 la navigation. D\u2019apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage du p\u00e9titionnaire, sa femme a alors fait demi-tour et remont\u00e9 le courant sur une distance d\u2019environ un quart de mille, en s\u2019\u00e9loignant du barrage dans l\u2019intention de retourner \u00e0 Winnipeg. M. Hendricks dit qu\u2019il a alors regard\u00e9 en aval, vu que les rideaux du barrage \u00e9taient tous relev\u00e9s et observ\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait plus d\u2019\u00e9criteaux \u00e0 la bou\u00e9e. Il a cru alors que le niveau de l\u2019eau \u00e9tait le m\u00eame des deux c\u00f4t\u00e9s du barrage. Il n\u2019a pu distinguer aucune chute; par contre, il a constat\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait plusieurs personnes qui se promenaient et qui p\u00eachaient dans de petites embarcations de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 du pont. De tout cela, il a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de danger \u00e0 passer sous le pont et il a dit \u00e0 sa femme de le faire. L\u00e0-dessus, Mme Hendricks a chang\u00e9 de direction et s\u2019est dirig\u00e9e vers la quatri\u00e8me trav\u00e9e du pont, \u00e0 une vitesse de dix ou douze milles \u00e0 l\u2019heure, selon l\u2019estimation de M. Hendricks. Ce n\u2019est que lorsque le bateau a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 environ cinquante pieds du barrage que la d\u00e9nivellation est devenue clairement visible et le bruit de la chute, tr\u00e8s audible. Mme Hendricks a alors tourn\u00e9 le bateau en travers du courant, de c\u00f4t\u00e9 par rapport au barrage. Le bateau se trouvait donc alors dans une position p\u00e9rilleuse. Au proc\u00e8s, M. Hendricks a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait cri\u00e9 \u00e0 sa femme: \u00abCut it\u00bb (Arr\u00eate-le) bien qu\u2019il ait dit dans une d\u00e9claration ant\u00e9rieure: [TRADUCTION] \u00abMa femme a essay\u00e9 de faire demi-tour et je lui ai dit de faire marche arri\u00e8re. Elle l\u2019a fait mais le moteur est sorti de l\u2019eau.\u00bb Son compagnon, M. Atkinson, a fait une d\u00e9claration dans le m\u00eame sens. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, il est \u00e9tabli que le moteur s\u2019est trouv\u00e9 verrouill\u00e9 l\u2019h\u00e9lice hors de l\u2019eau, de sorte que l\u2019on ne pouvait plus man\u0153uvrer le bateau. Voyant cela, M. Hendricks a pris les commandes \u00e0 la place de sa femme et il a tent\u00e9 d\u2019abaisser le moteur. Le courant a entra\u00een\u00e9 le bateau par-dessus le barrage, il s\u2019est empli d\u2019eau et a chavir\u00e9. En cons\u00e9quence, Mme Hendricks s\u2019est noy\u00e9e.\nLe p\u00e9titionnaire all\u00e8gue que le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de sa femme r\u00e9sulte de l\u2019incurie, l\u2019imprudence et la n\u00e9gligence des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada; il pr\u00e9tend que ces pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s ont fait preuve de n\u00e9gligence en ne fermant pas les vannes avant le 19 juin 1966, en cr\u00e9ant une dangereuse d\u00e9nivellation, en n\u2019avisant pas le public de ce danger au moyen de signaux suffisants, sonores ou visuels, en ne rempla\u00e7ant pas les \u00e9criteaux d\u2019avertissement qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 install\u00e9s sur la bou\u00e9e et emport\u00e9s par la crue, en ne prenant pas les pr\u00e9cautions n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00e9viter tout dommage \u00e0 ceux qui se servent d\u2019embarcations de plaisance, en n\u2019ayant pas de secours d\u2019urgence en cas de besoin et enfin en cr\u00e9ant un pi\u00e8ge sur la rivi\u00e8re Rouge sans en aviser d\u2019aucune fa\u00e7on ceux qui s\u2019y prom\u00e8nent en bateau de plaisance.\nEn d\u00e9fense, la Couronne all\u00e8gue que l\u2019accident r\u00e9sulte de la seule n\u00e9gligence du p\u00e9titionnaire et de feu son \u00e9pouse ou, subsidiairement, que leur n\u00e9gligence commune est la cause prochaine et efficiente de l\u2019accident.\nIl me para\u00eet que s\u2019il y a eu n\u00e9gligence de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, c\u2019est de ne pas avoir remplac\u00e9 les \u00e9criteaux de signalisation sur la bou\u00e9e, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir ceux qui ne connaissent pas cette partie de la rivi\u00e8re du fait qu\u2019il y avait une chute plus loin. Cette omission cr\u00e9ait un \u00e9tat de fait qui pr\u00e9sentait un danger possible pour ceux qui ignoraient l\u2019existence du barrage et de la chute. Mais les Hendricks \u00e9taient parfaitement au courant de l\u2019existence de la chute et du barrage et il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un p\u00e9ril qui pouvait non seulement \u00eatre tr\u00e8s facilement \u00e9vit\u00e9, mais auquel ils se sont m\u00eame expos\u00e9s d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment.\nBien que M. Hendricks ait t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il a cru que le niveau de la rivi\u00e8re s\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9galis\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 lui permettre de passer sous le pont sans danger, je ne crois pas qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 d\u2019une conclusion raisonnable de la part d\u2019une personne qui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu la chute \u00e0 six reprises et utilis\u00e9 le canal et l\u2019\u00e9cluse plus d\u2019une fois. L\u2019\u00e9tat du canal et de l\u2019\u00e9cluse le jour de l\u2019accident aurait d\u00fb lui faire comprendre que la saison de navigation n\u2019\u00e9tait pas encore ouverte \u00e0 cet endroit. A mon avis, l\u2019omission de M. et Mme Hendricks de veiller \u00e0 leur propre s\u00e9curit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 le facteur d\u00e9terminant du malheur qui leur est arriv\u00e9. L\u2019absence des \u00e9criteaux de signalisation sur la bou\u00e9e n\u2019a pas contribu\u00e9 en elle-m\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019accident, ce dernier r\u00e9sultant uniquement des actes du p\u00e9titionnaire et de sa femme. Leur conduite n\u00e9gligente est distincte de toute n\u00e9gligence imputable \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e et elle est post\u00e9rieure. En dirigeant comme ils l\u2019ont fait leur embarcation de plaisance, ils auraient d\u00fb pr\u00e9voir l\u2019accident qui est survenu. La loi dite The Tortfeasors and Contributory Negligence Act, S.R.M. 1954, c. 266, ne peut avoir aucune application en la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\nPour tous ces motifs, je rejetterais l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nLe jugement des Juges Hall et Spence a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par\nLE JUGE SPENCE\u2014Le pourvoi est \u00e0 I\u2019encontre d\u2019un jugement du Juge Cattanach de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier du Canada, prononc\u00e9 le 31 mai 1968, par lequel le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a rejet\u00e9 la p\u00e9tition de droit du demandeur.\nJ\u2019ai eu le privil\u00e8ge de lire les motifs du Juge Ritchie, mais \u00e0 regret, je ne puis \u00eatre d\u2019accord avec ses conclusions.\nPour \u00e9viter les r\u00e9p\u00e9titions, je ne ferai pas un expos\u00e9 des faits aussi complet que celui du Juge Ritchie et ne mentionnerai que ceux qui sont pertinents aux pr\u00e9sents motifs.\nAvant 1903, la rivi\u00e8re Rouge \u00e9tait navigable de la ville de Winnipeg jusqu\u2019au lac du m\u00eame nom, sauf quelques portages. Cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0. afin de rendre navigables, en y \u00e9levant le niveau de l\u2019eau, les rapides Lister qui s\u2019\u00e9tendent sur huit milles depuis un point situ\u00e9 \u00e0 environ cinq milles en amont du barrage et des \u00e9cluses St. Andrew, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a fait construire des installations, qu\u2019on peut d\u00e9crire sommairement de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nAu fond de la rivi\u00e8re, on a coul\u00e9 une digue en b\u00e9ton large d\u2019environ 37 pieds qui s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve jusqu\u2019\u00e0 20 pieds au-dessus du lit de la rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 certains endroits. On a aussi construit un pont pour les voitures imm\u00e9diatement au-dessus du barrage, sur six gros piliers de b\u00e9ton. Le tablier du pont supporte \u00e0 sa partie inf\u00e9rieure une s\u00e9rie de vannes. Ces vannes sont accroch\u00e9es par le haut \u00e0 charni\u00e8re sous le pont, de sorte qu\u2019on peut soit les relever juste au\u2011dessous du tablier du pont en position parall\u00e8le \u00e0 celui-ci ou les laisser tomber \u00e0 la verticale, le bas reposant alors dans une rainure le long du sommet de la digue. Un rideau, qu\u2019on a peut-\u00eatre d\u00e9crit avec justesse comme un store japonais, peut se baisser de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 r\u00e9duire l\u2019espace libre entre le tablier du pont et le sommet de la digue. Lorsque ces rideaux sont abaiss\u00e9s, le niveau de l\u2019eau monte jusqif\u00e0 environ quatorze pieds au-dessus de la digue, selon les conclusions du savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance. D\u2019autre part, quand les rideaux et les vannes dans lesquelles ils se trouvent sont relev\u00e9s, tout l\u2019espace entre les piliers est libre. Le 19 juin 1966, jour de l\u2019accident, il passait 2.4 pieds d\u2019eau par-dessus la digue. Il est donc clair que, les vannes du barrage relev\u00e9es ou abaiss\u00e9es, il y avait sous la surface de l\u2019eau, toujours cach\u00e9 \u00e0 la vue, un obstacle consid\u00e9rable en b\u00e9ton, qui constituait ce que le Juge en chef Duff a d\u00e9crit dans l\u2019affaire Le Roi c. Hochelaga Shipping & Towing Company Ltd.[1] comme [TRADUCTION] \u00abun grave danger pour la navigation\u00bb. Quand les vannes et rideaux \u00e9taient abaiss\u00e9s, le danger pour la navigation \u00e9tait manifeste au premier coup d\u2019\u0153il puisque, en fait, le passage \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement ferm\u00e9 sur toute la largeur de la rivi\u00e8re. Quand les vannes et rideaux \u00e9taient relev\u00e9s, les choses avaient l\u2019aspect de la troisi\u00e8me ouverture de gauche sur la photographie produite au proc\u00e8s comme pi\u00e8ce n\u00b0 5, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que le tout avait l\u2019apparence d\u2019un pont ordinaire enjambant une rivi\u00e8re. Pour permettre la navigation au-del\u00e0 du barrage, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a fait am\u00e9nager, du c\u00f4t\u00e9 ouest de la rivi\u00e8re Rouge, un canal formant chenal et une \u00e9cluse. Le canal a \u00e9t\u00e9 dragu\u00e9 et la terre rejet\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019est du canal entre celui-ci et la rivi\u00e8re de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 former une \u00eele artificielle consid\u00e9rable. Juste en aval du pont, on a am\u00e9nag\u00e9 une \u00e9cluse. Les bateaux venant de Winnipeg, dans le sens du courant, franchissent ces am\u00e9nagements en entrant dans le canal du c\u00f4t\u00e9 ouest de la rivi\u00e8re et en suivant le canal \u00e0 l\u2019ouest de l\u2019\u00eele artificielle jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cluse pour rejoindre la rivi\u00e8re qui continue ensuite vers le nord. Aux termes de la Loi sur les travaux publics, S.R.C. 1952, c. 228, le ministre des Travaux publics avait l\u2019administration, la charge et la gestion de ces am\u00e9nagements et pendant toute la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 les faits pertinents se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s, les employ\u00e9s de ce minist\u00e8re \u00e9taient des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de la Couronne, agissant comme tels dans l\u2019exercice de leurs fonctions. Cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu pour les fins du proc\u00e8s.\nIl \u00e9tait d\u2019usage dans l\u2019exploitation de l\u2019\u00e9cluse et du barrage de relever les vannes et rideaux au cours du mois de novembre et de cesser toute activit\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Au printemps, \u00e0 une date qui variait selon le d\u00e9bit de la rivi\u00e8re, on abaissait les vannes et on fermait les rideaux de sorte qu\u2019au sud, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire en amont du barrage, l\u2019eau montait rapidement. Le canal, qui \u00e9tait vide pendant que le niveau de l\u2019eau \u00e9tait bas, s\u2019emplissait et l\u2019\u00e9cluse recommen\u00e7ait \u00e0 fonctionner. Pour signaler aux embarcations qui descendaient le courant le d\u00e9tour \u00e0 faire par le canal au lieu de suivre le chenal principal, les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de la Couronne avaient plac\u00e9 au milieu de la rivi\u00e8re, un peu au sud de l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 sud de l\u2019\u00eele artificielle, une bou\u00e9e qu\u2019on a d\u00e9crite comme une bou\u00e9e flottante de 6 pieds. Cette bou\u00e9e se composait d\u2019une ancre de 400 livres retenant une plate-forme flottante surmont\u00e9e d\u2019un tube peint en noir.\nLe surintendant du canal a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 qu\u2019en 1964, il avait remarqu\u00e9 que les passagers des petites embarcations prenaient de grands risques en naviguant dans l\u2019anse juste en amont du barrage et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, il avait fait installer sur la bou\u00e9e un m\u00e2t auquel \u00e9taient fix\u00e9s par des vis \u00e0 bois deux \u00e9criteaux. Ceux-ci \u00e9taient \u00e0 angle droit. mesuraient chacun environ trois pieds de longueur sur un pied de hauteur, et portaient la m\u00eame inscription: \u00abDanger\u2014Falls Ahead\u00bb.\nEn 1966, la bou\u00e9e ainsi munie des \u00e9criteaux a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en place le 13 mai. A cette date, l\u2019\u00e9cluse ne fonctionnait pas encore. Les vannes \u00e0 rideaux n\u2019avaient pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 abaiss\u00e9es parce que la rivi\u00e8re n\u2019\u00e9tait pas encore en crue. Une longue exp\u00e9rience avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait ni convenable, ni utile de fermer ces vannes et rideaux avant que le d\u00e9bit de l\u2019eau en aval du pont Redwood dans la ville de Winnipeg, quelque quinze ou dix-huit milles en amont de l\u2019\u00e9cluse St. Andrew, n\u2019ait diminu\u00e9 \u00e0 10,300 pieds cubes \u00e0 la seconde. Apr\u00e8s le 13 mai, la crue de la rivi\u00e8re \u00e9tait telle que la plate-forme de la bou\u00e9e, attach\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019ancre de 400 livres par une cha\u00eene, se trouvait submerg\u00e9e ainsi que la bou\u00e9e, le m\u00e2t et les \u00e9criteaux.\nSelon toute probabilit\u00e9, c\u2019est cette pouss\u00e9e des eaux de la rivi\u00e8re qui a emport\u00e9 les \u00e9criteaux. Le premier s\u2019est d\u00e9tach\u00e9 pendant le mois de mai et, au d\u00e9but de la semaine du 6 juin 1966, le surintendant a remarqu\u00e9 que le second n\u2019\u00e9tait plus au m\u00e2t surmontant la bou\u00e9e. Pour installer les \u00e9criteaux on s\u2019\u00e9tait servi d\u2019une chaloupe de 19 pieds de longueur, remis\u00e9e ensuite dans l\u2019\u00e9cluse par pr\u00e9caution. Apr\u00e8s la disparition du premier \u00e9criteau, le surintendant ne voulait pas sortir la chaloupe de l\u2019\u00e9cluse et prendre le risque d\u2019aller sur la rivi\u00e8re le remplacer, le courant en p\u00e9riode de crue \u00e9tant si fort qu\u2019il aurait mis la vie du personnel en danger. Quand, quelques jours apr\u00e8s le 6 juin, il a remarqu\u00e9 que le second \u00e9criteau avait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 emport\u00e9, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 possible de se servir de la chaloupe pour remplacer les \u00e9criteaux, mais la baisse des eaux avait mis le canal \u00e0 sec et la chaloupe se trouvait immobilis\u00e9e dans l\u2019\u00e9cluse, de sorte qu\u2019on ne pouvait pas s\u2019en servir. De plus, les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de la Couronne s\u2019attendaient que le d\u00e9bit de la rivi\u00e8re diminuerait assez pour permettre d\u2019abaisser les vannes et rideaux. Cette op\u00e9ration aurait fait monter le niveau de l\u2019eau en amont du barrage, ce qui aurait rempli le canal et permis d\u2019utiliser la chaloupe.\nLa fermeture des vannes et rideaux a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise \u00e0 plusieurs reprises \u00e0 cause d\u2019accroissements de d\u00e9bit. Ce n\u2019est que le 20 juin qu\u2019on a abaiss\u00e9 les vannes, soit le lendemain de l\u2019accident mortel dont d\u00e9coule la pr\u00e9sente p\u00e9tition de droit.\nJ\u2019analyserai plus loin la conduite du p\u00e9titionnaire Egan Hendricks. Je veux d\u2019abord consid\u00e9rer l\u2019all\u00e9gation que la Couronne est responsable par suite de la n\u00e9gligence de ses pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s. Il n\u2019y a pas de doute que le barrage en b\u00e9ton dans le chenal navigable constituait un grave danger pour la navigation. Les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de la Couronne, conscients de ce danger, avaient fait placer au-dessus de la bou\u00e9e qui indiquait le d\u00e9tour par le canal des \u00e9criteaux signalant l\u2019existence de la chute en aval. A mon avis, en agissant ainsi les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de la Couronne accomplissaient un devoir de leur charge, celui de signaler le danger pour la navigation, danger que la Couronne avait elle-m\u00eame cr\u00e9\u00e9. Les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de la Couronne, au courant de la disparition des \u00e9criteaux ne les ont pas remplac\u00e9s. Je suis d\u2019avis que tant que durait la forte crue de la rivi\u00e8re, leur omission se justifiait de deux fa\u00e7ons: d\u2019abord pour le motif invoqu\u00e9 par le surintendant, savoir que tenter d\u2019aller sur la rivi\u00e8re en chaloupe aurait mis en danger la vie de l\u2019\u00e9quipage et ensuite parce que vu l\u2019\u00e9tat de crue de la rivi\u00e8re, il ne pouvait y avoir personne \u00e0 mettre en garde. Cependant, apr\u00e8s le 6 juin 1966, les circonstances \u00e9taient \u00e0 mon avis tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes. Le surintendant a admis qu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, il lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 tout \u00e0 fait possible de remplacer les \u00e9criteaux s\u2019il avait eu une embarcation \u00e0 sa disposition. Il a \u00e9galement admis qu\u2019on n\u2019avait pas besoin d\u2019une embarcation tr\u00e8s grande et qu\u2019il aurait suffi d\u2019en. avoir une de la grandeur de leur chaloupe ou de celle du p\u00e9titionnaire Hendricks qui a pass\u00e9 pardessus le barrage. Il est certain qu\u2019on aurait pu assez facilement se procurer une embarcation de ce genre. La chaloupe des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e9tait dans l\u2019\u00e9cluse. Elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas plus grosse que l\u2019em- barcation du p\u00e9titionnaire et bien que l\u2019\u00e9cluse ait \u00e9t\u00e9 vide \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, on aurait pu facilement la tirer par-dessus la berme et la mettre \u00e0 l\u2019eau. Il y avait, dans les environs imm\u00e9diats, d\u2019autres embarcations \u00e9quip\u00e9es de moteurs hors-bord capables de filer \u00e0 20 milles \u00e0 l\u2019heure; on pouvait facilement s\u2019en procurer une, ou bien le minist\u00e8re pouvait louer une embarcation n\u2019importe o\u00f9 entre l\u2019\u00e9cluse St. Andrew et Winnipeg, descendre la rivi\u00e8re comme le p\u00e9titionnaire l\u2019a fait, s\u2019approcher de la bou\u00e9e et remplacer les \u00e9criteaux. Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements que je vais relater ci-apr\u00e8s et qui ont caus\u00e9 l\u2019accident o\u00f9 Mme Hendricks a perdu la vie ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 l\u2019importance de remplacer les \u00e9criteaux de signalisation au-dessus de la bou\u00e9e aussit\u00f4t qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible de le faire. Je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019omission de remplacer ces \u00e9criteaux imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s que le second eut \u00e9t\u00e9 emport\u00e9 constitue une n\u00e9gligence de la part des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de la Couronne. Ce remplacement aurait alors eu lieu vers le 7 ou le 8 juin, soit plus de dix jours avant l\u2019accident qui est \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la pr\u00e9sente p\u00e9tition.\nDans l\u2019affaire Le Roi c. Hochelaga (d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9e), on a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019une omission similaire de signaler un grave danger \u00e0 la navigation donnait lieu \u00e0 l\u2019application des dispositions de l\u2019art. 19(c) de la Loi sur la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier, tel qu\u2019il se lisait alors. La responsabilit\u00e9 de la Couronne est maintenant r\u00e9gie par l\u2019art. 3(1) de la Loi sur la responsabilit\u00e9 de la Couronne, Statuts du Canada, 1952-1953, c. 30, qui se lit comme suit:\n3. (1) La Couronne est responsable in tort des dommages dont elle serait responsable si elle \u00e9tait un particulier en \u00e9tat de majorit\u00e9 et de capacit\u00e9,\n(a) \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un acte pr\u00e9judiciable commis par un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de la Couronne, ou\n(b) \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un manquement au devoir aff\u00e9rent \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, l\u2019occupation, la possession ou le contr\u00f4le de biens.\nA mon avis, la Couronne est responsable en vertu des alin\u00e9as (a) et (b) de cet article.\nL\u2019avocat de la Couronne a cit\u00e9 un certain nombre de pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents que j\u2019ai \u00e9tudi\u00e9s, mais en aucun de ces cas la Couronne n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 exon\u00e9r\u00e9e de sa responsabilit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir cr\u00e9\u00e9 dans un cours d\u2019eau navigable un danger pour la navigation et avoir manqu\u00e9 de signaler ce danger de fa\u00e7on convenable. Dans l\u2019affaire Cleveland-Cliffs SS. Co. c. La Reine[2], la r\u00e9clamation r\u00e9sultait d\u2019un \u00e9chouage et il s\u2019agissait de d\u00e9terminer si celui-ci avait eu lieu dans le chenal balis\u00e9 ou en dehors. Dans ce cas-l\u00e0, il y avait eu \u00e9chouage au fond et non pas accident caus\u00e9 par un obstacle artificiel install\u00e9 sous la surface de l\u2019eau.\nDans l\u2019affaire Iron Ore Transport Co. Ltd. c. La Reine[3], il y avait eu collision avec un objet submerg\u00e9 non identifi\u00e9, mais le p\u00e9titionnaire n\u2019avait pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un obstacle plac\u00e9 par la Couronne.\nDans l\u2019affaire La Reine c. Moss[4], sir Henry Strong, Juge en chef du Canada, dit \u00e0 la p. 331:\n[TRADUCTION] Je reconnais volontiers que, si l\u2019on tient le chenal nord pour navigable, la construction d\u2019un barrage sur la rivi\u00e8re pour servir de pont aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 une atteinte aux droits du public, \u00e0 moins que la Couronne ne la l\u00e9galise de quelque fa\u00e7on. Il ne suffit pas, pour justifier la mise en place d\u2019un obstacle dans une rivi\u00e8re ou un port, que dans l\u2019ensemble, les avantages de l\u2019ouvrage nuisible \u00e0 la navigation d\u00e9passent de beaucoup les inconv\u00e9nients \u00e0 celle-ci.\nComme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait remarquer, dans l\u2019affaire Le Roi c. Hochelaga, d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9e, la Couronne a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue responsable parce qu\u2019elle avait cr\u00e9\u00e9 un grave danger pour la navigation qui a eu des effets tr\u00e8s semblables \u00e0 ceux que nous examinons dans la pr\u00e9sente cause. Dans cette affaire, on avait construit une jet\u00e9e qui s\u2019avan\u00e7ait \u00e0 angle droit \u00e0 partir d\u2019un brise-lames. Avant d\u2019\u00eatre termin\u00e9e, la partie sup\u00e9rieure de la jet\u00e9e s\u2019est bris\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 sur une longueur d\u2019environ 50 pieds laissant la partie inf\u00e9rieure de la charpente et de l\u2019empierrement en place mais compl\u00e8tement submerg\u00e9e. Cette charpente submerg\u00e9e, invisible de la surface, ressemblait au barrage submerg\u00e9 dont il est question ici et par-dessus lequel il passait quelque 28 pouces d\u2019eau le 19 juin 1966. Je suis donc d\u2019avis que le p\u00e9titionnaire a prouv\u00e9 que la Couronne et ses pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s ont commis un acte pr\u00e9judiciable qui la rend responsable aux termes de l\u2019art. 3(1) de la Loi sur la responsabilit\u00e9 de la Couronne. La question que j\u2019\u00e9tudierai ensuite est celle de savoir si le comportement du p\u00e9titionnaire Egan Hendricks et de feu Mme Hendricks les prive du droit de recouvrer des dommages. Egan Hendricks avait demeur\u00e9 \u00e0 Winnipeg toute sa vie et, pendant les 7 ou 8 ans pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant l\u2019accident, il avait fait de la navigation de plaisance sur la rivi\u00e8re Rouge et bon nombre d\u2019autres cours d\u2019eau de la province. Il avait alors une embarcation un peu plus petite et au cours des ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, il avait fait 6 ou 7 fois, dans cette embarcation, le trajet en aval de Winnipeg jusqu\u2019au barrage et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cluse St. Andrew. Au moins \u00e0 trois reprises au cours de ces excursions, il avait emprunt\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9cluse St. Andrews pour se rendre quelque part en aval, au nord du barrage. D\u2019autres fois, il s\u2019\u00e9tait rendu en automobile de Winnipeg \u00e0 cet endroit. Chaque fois, il avait vu les deux \u00e9criteaux fix\u00e9s \u00e0 la bou\u00e9e dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question plus haut. Bien qu\u2019Egan Hendricks ait eu quelque exp\u00e9rience de la navigation et qu\u2019\u00e0 titre de membre du club nautique Redboyne, on lui ait enseign\u00e9 les pr\u00e9cautions \u00e0 prendre dans le maniement des petites embarcations et remis la brochure intitul\u00e9e \u00abSafety Afloat\u00bb o\u00f9 se trouve un aper\u00e7u du syst\u00e8me canadien de balisage, sa d\u00e9position d\u00e9montre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence qu\u2019il n\u2019y comprenait absolument rien et, en r\u00e9sum\u00e9, pensait que les bou\u00e9es n\u2019existaient que pour avertir d\u2019un obstacle sous la surface, sans comprendre leur but primordial, soit le balisage du chenal navigable. Il y a entre Winnipeg et l\u2019\u00e9cluse St. Andrew quelque 13 bou\u00e9es qu\u2019Egan Hendricks a crois\u00e9es au cours des 6 ou 7 excursions qu\u2019il a faites sur la rivi\u00e8re. Or, il ne se souvient pas que quelques-unes sont rouges, alors que, bien entendu, toutes celles qui d\u00e9limitent un c\u00f4t\u00e9 du chenal sont rouges et celles qui d\u00e9limitent l\u2019autre, sont noires.\nVers la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1965, Egan Hendricks et feu Mme Hendricks avaient achet\u00e9 \u00e0 frais communs un nouveau bateau. Celui-ci mesurait 19 pieds de longueur, 7 pieds de bau et environ 4 pieds de profondeur. Il \u00e9tait \u00e9quip\u00e9 d\u2019un moteur hors-bord Johnson de 90 CV et se gouvernait au moyen d\u2019un volant plac\u00e9 \u00e0 tribord \u00e0 l\u2019avant. Le fonctionnement du moteur se commandait par un dispositif install\u00e9 sur la paroi de tribord, une pouss\u00e9e vers l\u2019avant sur un seul levier embrayant d\u2019abord la marche avant et acc\u00e9l\u00e9rant ensuite le moteur selon la pression exerc\u00e9e. De la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re, le mouvement vers l\u2019arri\u00e8re du levier embrayait d\u2019abord la marche arri\u00e8re et acc\u00e9l\u00e9rait ensuite le moteur en marche arri\u00e8re. Quand les Hendricks ont achet\u00e9 ce bateau, il avait un mois d\u2019usage. Il avait tr\u00e8s peu servi, peut-\u00eatre pas du tout en 1965, et tr\u00e8s rarement en 1966. Le 19 juin 1966, le p\u00e9titionnaire Egan Hendricks, feu sa femme et M. John Atkinson, un ami, sont partis du club nautique Redboyne vers une heure de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi. Ils projetaient de descendre la rivi\u00e8re probablement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 Selkirk, qui se trouve beaucoup plus loin au nord, en aval du barrage et de l\u2019\u00e9cluse St. Andrew. C\u2019est le p\u00e9titionnaire, Hendricks qui conduisait au d\u00e9part; feu Mme Hendricks et M. Atkinson l\u2019accompagnaient comme passagers. Pour conduire, M. Hendricks \u00e9tait assis juste derri\u00e8re le volant, \u00e0 tribord et tourn\u00e9 vers l\u2019avant. Il y avait un autre si\u00e8ge \u00e0 babord \u00e9galement face \u00e0 la proue, et derri\u00e8re les si\u00e8ges avant deux autres si\u00e8ges faisant face \u00e0 la banquette arri\u00e8re. Quand le groupe est reparti, apr\u00e8s avoir mang\u00e9, c\u2019est feu Mme Hendricks qui a pris le volant; MM. Hendricks et Atkinson ont pris les si\u00e8ges tourn\u00e9s vers l\u2019arri\u00e8re et ont convers\u00e9 entre eux. Le groupe se dirigeait vers le barrage et l\u2019\u00e9cluse St. Andrew et feu Mme Hendricks conduisait l\u2019embarcation en direction du canal \u00e0 l\u2019ouest de l\u2019\u00eele artificielle vers l\u2019\u00e9cluse. M. Hendricks s\u2019est aper\u00e7u tout de suite, comme sa femme a d\u00fb le faire aussi, que l\u2019\u00e9cluse ne fonctionnait pas, car on pouvait facilement voir le fond du canal, qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 sec. A mon avis, l\u2019ignorance des Hendricks au sujet du syst\u00e8me canadien de balisage n\u2019entre pas en ligne de compte puisque pendant qu\u2019elle conduisait l\u2019embarcation dans le sens du courant, Mme Hendricks a effectivement gard\u00e9 la bou\u00e9e noire \u00e0 tribord et, par cons\u00e9quent, puisque la bou\u00e9e indiquait le c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit du chenal pour la navigation dans le sens du courant, elle a conduit de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 avoir la bou\u00e9e toujours \u00e0 tribord. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9position de M. Hendricks, quand sa femme s\u2019est rendu compte que le canal \u00e9tait ferm\u00e9, elle est revenue dans le chenal avec l\u2019intention de repartir \u00e0 contre-courant vers Winnipeg. MM. Hendricks et Atkinson se sont donc trouv\u00e9s \u00e0 regarder vers le barrage, puisqu\u2019ils \u00e9taient assis face \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re du bateau. M. Hendricks a jur\u00e9 qu\u2019il a alors cru que la rivi\u00e8re continuait au-del\u00e0 des six piliers sans aucun obstacle et sans diff\u00e9rence de niveau \u00e0 la surface de l\u2019eau. Il a m\u00eame vu, en regardant sous le pont, entre les piliers, plusieurs petites embarcations qui se trouvaient au nord du pont et dont les occupants semblaient p\u00eacher. A ce moment-l\u00e0, le bateau des Hendricks se trouvait \u00e0 environ un quart de mille en amont du pont c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire au sud et M. Hendricks a persist\u00e9 \u00e0 affirmer en contre\u2011interrogatoire qu\u2019\u00e0 cet endroit il n\u2019y avait aucun signe visible de chute du niveau de l\u2019eau sous le pont. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, M. Hendricks avait, en 6 ou 7 occasions dans ces parages constat\u00e9 une grosse chute du c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord du pont. Il s\u2019est dit convaincu, quand il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9, que toutes les fois qu\u2019il avait vu ces chutes, les vannes \u00e9taient abaiss\u00e9es et les rideaux ferm\u00e9s. De toute \u00e9vidence, \u00e0 chacune de ces occasions, il s\u2019\u00e9tait attendu \u00e0 voir une chute en aval du barrage. Le r\u00f4le du barrage consistait \u00e0 \u00e9lever le niveau de l\u2019eau et il fallait qu\u2019il y e\u00fbt une chute au nord du barrage. Par contre, le jour de l\u2019accident, il n\u2019y avait aucun barrage. Les vannes avec leurs rideaux \u00e9taient compl\u00e8tement relev\u00e9s sous le tablier du pont. La digue en b\u00e9ton \u00e9tait cach\u00e9e par les 28 pouces d\u2019eau coulant par dessus. \u00c9videmment, un observateur plac\u00e9 au nord du barrage pouvait facilement voir la chute de 4 \u00e0 5 pieds de hauteur, mais pour celui qui se trouvait un quart de mille au sud du barrage, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire en amont de celui-ci, la chute \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait invisible.\nM. Hendricks avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu les \u00e9criteaux signalant l\u2019existence de la chute. Il a remarqu\u00e9 que ce jour-l\u00e0, ces \u00e9criteaux n\u2019\u00e9taient pas l\u00e0. Il s\u2019est \u00e9galement rendu compte qu\u2019il \u00e9tait manifestement impossible de passer par l\u2019\u00e9cluse. Il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 avoir conclu de ces observations que la chute caus\u00e9e par le barrage qu\u2019il avait vue pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment n\u2019existait pas quand le barrage \u00e9tait ouvert et que l\u2019\u00e9cluse ne fonctionnait pas, et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019enl\u00e8vement des \u00e9criteaux indiquait qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de chute \u00e0 craindre et qu\u2019il pouvait sans risque continuer en aval dans son embarcation. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que selon toutes les apparences, ce pont \u00e9tait semblable \u00e0 tous les autres ponts de Winnipeg et l\u2019\u00e9cluse St. Andrew qu\u2019il avait franchis sans accident. Il a donc recommand\u00e9 ou sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 feu sa femme de changer de direction et de passer sous ce pont comme sous tous les autres, lui disant de se tenir au centre de la rivi\u00e8re pour \u00e9viter tout obstacle qui aurait pu se trouver pr\u00e8s des rives. Mme Hendricks s\u2019est dirig\u00e9e \u00e0 une vitesse de 10 \u00e0 12 milles \u00e0 l\u2019heure vers l\u2019ouverture entre le 3e et le 4e piliers, \u00e0 partir du c\u00f4t\u00e9 ouest. Le bateau s\u2019est ainsi approch\u00e9 \u00e0 environ 50 pieds du barrage. C\u2019est alors que feu Mme Hendricks aussi bien que MM. Hendricks et Atkinson se sont rendu compte de l\u2019existence de la chute. Le courant \u00e9tait beaucoup plus rapide et on pouvait entendre le grondement de l\u2019eau tombant pardessus la digue. Mme Hendricks a tent\u00e9 de faire demi-tour pour remonter le courant. Cette man\u0153uvre ne r\u00e9ussit \u00e9videmment qu\u2019\u00e0 placer le bateau en travers du courant. Les t\u00e9moignages sont contradictoires sur la question de savoir si Mme Hendricks a tent\u00e9 de faire marche arri\u00e8re. Au proc\u00e8s, M. Hendricks a affirm\u00e9 cat\u00e9goriquement qu\u2019elle ne l\u2019a pas fait et qu\u2019il ne lui a pas dit de le faire, mais dans sa d\u00e9claration \u00e0 la Gendarmerie royale du Canada, le jour de l\u2019accident, tr\u00e8s peu de temps apr\u00e8s, il a dit:\n[TRADUCTION] Ma femme a essay\u00e9 de faire demi-tour et je lui ai dit de faire marche arri\u00e8re. Elle l\u2019a fait mais le moteur est sorti de l\u2019eau.\nM. John Atkinson, le passager, a dit dans sa d\u00e9claration qu\u2019il a faite en m\u00eame temps:\n[TRADUCTION] En arrivant plus pr\u00e8s, nous avons constat\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait une grande d\u00e9nivellation. Ir\u00e8ne a donc essay\u00e9 de mettre le bateau en marche arri\u00e8re mais elle n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi. Egan a essay\u00e9 de mettre le moteur en marche arri\u00e8re mais le moteur est sorti de l\u2019eau.\nIl y avait un verrou pour tenir le moteur hors-bord du bateau des Hendricks abaiss\u00e9 dans l\u2019eau. Ce verrou se commandait de deux fa\u00e7ons: il y avait sur la planche de bord, juste \u00e0 gauche du volant, un levier qui, actionn\u00e9 dans un sens, faisait remonter le moteur et dans l\u2019autre sens le faisait basculer vers le bas; il y avait \u00e9galement une commande manuelle sur le moteur lui-m\u00eame. On pouvait piloter le bateau en mettant le moteur dans la position abaiss\u00e9e, que le verrou soit enclench\u00e9 ou non. Egan Hendricks a dit dans sa d\u00e9position que lors de l\u2019accident, le verrou n\u2019\u00e9tait pas enclench\u00e9, de sorte que si l\u2019h\u00e9lice donnait contre un obstacle submerg\u00e9, le moteur se rel\u00e8verait sans l\u2019endommager. Il a \u00e9galement admis que quand le verrou n\u2019\u00e9tait pas enclench\u00e9, si l\u2019on faisait subitement marche arri\u00e8re, le moteur sortait de l\u2019eau, avec le r\u00e9sultat que, l\u2019h\u00e9lice et le gouvernail une fois sortis de l\u2019eau, on ne pouvait plus man\u0153uvrer le bateau d\u2019aucune mani\u00e8re.\nLe savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu \u00e0 n\u00e9gligence de la part du p\u00e9titionnaire dans le fait de se servir du bateau sans avoir verrouill\u00e9 le moteur en place. Il s\u2019est s\u00fbrement fi\u00e9 \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re d\u00e9claration de M. Hendricks \u00e0 l\u2019effet que le moteur s\u2019est relev\u00e9 quand on a essay\u00e9 de le mettre en marche arri\u00e8re, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage au proc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019effet que le moteur est sorti hors de l\u2019eau quand il a frapp\u00e9 ce que M. Hendricks a d\u00e9crit comme un \u00e9cueil mais qui devait \u00eatre le sommet de la digue.\nJe suis d\u2019avis que la n\u00e9gligence consistant \u00e0 ne pas avoir verrouill\u00e9 le moteur avant de tenter de le mettre en marche arri\u00e8re n\u2019a pas caus\u00e9 l\u2019accident et n\u2019y a pas contribu\u00e9. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9position de M. Hendricks, ni lui, ni feu sa femme n\u2019ont fait aucune man\u0153uvre pour \u00e9viter l\u2019accident avant que l\u2019embarcation n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 moins de 50 pieds de la digue submerg\u00e9e. M\u00eame s\u2019ils avaient r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 enclencher le verrou du moteur, la marche arri\u00e8re ne leur aurait pas permis d\u2019\u00e9viter la catastrophe durant les quelques secondes que le bateau a mis \u00e0 franchir ces 50 pieds avant de sauter pardessus le barrage. Il \u00e9tait alors irr\u00e9m\u00e9diablement prisonnier du courant vers le barrage. De plus, \u00e0 cause de la tentative de feu Mme Hendricks de faire demi-tour, le bateau se trouvait en travers du courant; m\u00eame la marche arri\u00e8re \u00e0 plein gaz n\u2019aurait pas chang\u00e9 le cours des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont suivi. Ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements sont, naturellement, le franchissement de la digue et un plongeon dans la chute de 5 pieds. Le tourbillonnement de l\u2019eau a retenu le bateau sous la chute, celui-ci s\u2019est empli d\u2019eau et a chavir\u00e9. Mme Hendricks s\u2019est noy\u00e9e.\nDans ces circonstances, est-ce que la n\u00e9gligence d\u2019Egan Hendricks ou de feu sa femme est telle qu\u2019elle le prive du droit d\u2019obtenir r\u00e9paration de la Couronne, soit \u00e0 titre personnel, soit en qualit\u00e9 d\u2019administrateur de la succession de son \u00e9pouse? C\u2019est s\u00fbrement ainsi que le Juge Cattanach en a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans ses motifs de jugement:\n[TRADUCTION] D\u2019apr\u00e8s la th\u00e9orie juridique de la causalit\u00e9, ses actes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 la seule cause prochaine de son malheur. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 toutes fins pratiques, l\u2019auteur de sa propre infortune, bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne soit pas n\u00e9cessairement sans reproche, mais je n\u2019\u00e9mets pas d\u2019opinion sur cette derni\u00e8re question. La loi intitul\u00e9e The Tortfeasors and Contributory Negligence Act, 1954, S.R.M. ch. 266, ne s\u2019applique pas ici parce que, comme je viens de le dire, la n\u00e9gligence des p\u00e9titionnaires a \u00e9t\u00e9 la seule cause du dommage qu\u2019ils ont subi.\nLe Juge Ritchie en est venu \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion. En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je suis d\u2019avis que cela d\u00e9coule d\u2019une appr\u00e9ciation erron\u00e9e de la preuve. D\u2019abord, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, la rivi\u00e8re Rouge est un cours d\u2019eau navigable depuis toujours et le p\u00e9titionnaire avait un droit strict de s\u2019y trouver. Il est vrai que la \u00absaison de navigation\u00bb n\u2019\u00e9tait pas encore ouverte. L\u2019article 1 (g) des R\u00e8glements pour l\u2019utilisation et l\u2019exploitation de l\u2019\u00e9cluse St. Andrews (C.P. 6514\/49), dont le p\u00e9titionnaire a reconnu avoir re\u00e7u une copie lors d\u2019un passage pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent dans l\u2019\u00e9cluse, d\u00e9finit la \u00absaison de navigation\u00bb comme la p\u00e9riode qui s\u00e9pare l\u2019ouverture et la fermeture de l\u2019\u00e9cluse \u00e0 la circulation. L\u2019article 4 \u00e9dicte que l\u2019\u00e9cluse sera ouverte jour et nuit pendant la \u00absaison de navigation\u00bb, mais le p\u00e9titionnaire n\u2019essayait pas d\u2019emprunter l\u2019\u00e9cluse hors de la \u00absaison de navigation\u00bb. L\u2019\u00e9cluse \u00e9tait manifestement ferm\u00e9e, le canal qui y m\u00e8ne \u00e9tant bloqu\u00e9 par un remblai de terre. Ce que l\u2019appelant a voulu faire, c\u2019est passer sous le pont. L\u2019article 17(1) des R\u00e8glements d\u00e9cr\u00e8te:\nNavires s\u2019approchant d\u2019une \u00e9cluse ou d\u2019un pont\n17. (1) Il incombe au capitaine ou \u00e0 la personne qui a la charge du navire, lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019approche d\u2019une \u00e9cluse ou d\u2019un pont, de s\u2019assurer si cette \u00e9cluse ou ce pont est pr\u00eat \u00e0 laisser entrer ou passer son navire, et il doit r\u00e9duire la vitesse de son navire assez t\u00f4t pour \u00e9viter toute collision avec l\u2019\u00e9cluse ou ses portes ou avec le pont ou les autres ouvrages.\nLe p\u00e9titionnaire s\u2019est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re exigence de ce r\u00e8glement en constatant que l\u2019\u00e9cluse n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eate \u00e0 le laisser entrer. Je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il s\u2019est \u00e9galement conform\u00e9 \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me prescription en d\u00e9cidant que le pont \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 le laisser passer. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 insist\u00e9 sur le fait que le p\u00e9titionnaire n\u2019avait jamais vu l\u2019\u00e9cluse, le barrage et le pont sauf quand les vannes et rideaux \u00e9taient abaiss\u00e9s et c\u2019est alors et alors seulement qu\u2019il avait vu une chute du c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord. En ces occasions il avait \u00e9galement remarqu\u00e9 les \u00e9criteaux sur la bou\u00e9e signalant le danger que repr\u00e9sentait la chute (Danger\u2014Falls Ahead), cette chute-l\u00e0 qu\u2019il avait vue. Le jour de l\u2019accident, il a vu en venant du c\u00f4t\u00e9 sud du chenal et ensuite au centre, un pont ordinaire \u00e0 six piliers, sans aucun signe de l\u2019existence d\u2019un barrage ou de vannes. Le p\u00e9titionnaire n\u2019a jamais vu, ni alors, ni ant\u00e9rieurement, la digue en b\u00e9ton. Lorsque le niveau de l\u2019eau \u00e9tait normal, cette digue \u00e9tait recouverte de 14 pieds d\u2019eau, et, quand le barrage \u00e9tait ouvert, de 28 pouces d\u2019eau; Alors que les vannes et rideaux \u00e9taient abaiss\u00e9s les fois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, le p\u00e9titionnaire avait remarqu\u00e9 les \u00e9criteaux pr\u00e9venant de la chute et la chute elle-m\u00eame qui faisait l\u2019objet de l\u2019avertissement.\nPar contre, le 19 juin, les \u00e9criteaux n\u2019\u00e9taient pas l\u00e0 et les vannes et rideaux qu\u2019il savait \u00eatre la cause de la chute \u00e9taient relev\u00e9s. Le p\u00e9titionnaire en a donc conclu que puisque les vannes et les rideaux n\u2019\u00e9taient pas en place pour retenir l\u2019eau et la faire monter, il n\u2019y avait pas de diff\u00e9rence de niveau entre les deux c\u00f4t\u00e9s du pont. Je suis d\u2019avis que le p\u00e9titionnaire \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 de tirer cette conclusion. De l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 il a regard\u00e9, soit \u00e0 environ 400 verges au sud du pont-barrage, il ne pouvait ni voir ni entendre la chute, et il pouvait voir de petites embarcations juste au nord du pont. Le p\u00e9titionnaire ignorait tout de l\u2019existence de la grosse digue en b\u00e9ton qui \u00e9tait totalement submerg\u00e9e. En tenant compte de toutes les circonstances pr\u00e9sentes le 19 juin, je conclus que le p\u00e9titionnaire, quand il s\u2019est lev\u00e9 debout dans son bateau \u00e0 400 verges du pont-barrage et qu\u2019il a regard\u00e9 en direction nord, n\u2019a pas commis une n\u00e9gligence en jugeant que son bateau pouvait sans danger passer sous le pont et en disant \u00e0 sa femme de le faire.\nToutefois, le p\u00e9titionnaire s\u2019est alors assis face \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re et a repris sa conversation avec M. Atkinson. Le bateau allait \u00e0 10 ou 12 milles \u00e0 l\u2019heure environ. A cette vitesse, il a d\u00fb mettre 60 secondes \u00e0 parcourir les 400 verges qui le s\u00e9paraient du pont. Pendant ce temps-l\u00e0, Hendricks aurait d\u00fb tout surveiller tr\u00e8s attentivement. La man\u0153uvre qu\u2019il avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 feu Mme Hendricks de faire \u00e9tait inhabituelle et il ne l\u2019avait jamais ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e auparavant. Il semble que si le p\u00e9titionnaire et les autres occupants de l\u2019embarcation avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 attentifs, ils auraient eu amplement le temps d\u2019arr\u00eater la marche en avant du bateau. On doit se rappeler que les petites embarcations qui se promenaient derri\u00e8re le barrage et qui avaient d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le surintendant \u00e0 installer les \u00e9criteaux de signalisation, avaient \u00e9vit\u00e9 tout accident, bien que leurs occupants aient couru un certain danger. Malheureusement, ni le p\u00e9titionnaire ni feu Mme Hendricks, et encore moins leur passager, M. Atkinson, n\u2019ont remarqu\u00e9 quoi que ce soit d\u2019anormal avant que le bateau ne soit qu\u2019\u00e0 50 pieds en amont de la chute de 4 ou 5 pieds, form\u00e9e par l\u2019eau d\u00e9valant la paroi nord de la digue en b\u00e9ton. Le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a estim\u00e9 que cette digue avait 35 pieds de largeur \u00e0 sa base. D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019esquisse dont il s\u2019est servi (pi\u00e8ce n\u00b0 9) il semble que la digue ait mesur\u00e9 30 pieds de largeur \u00e0 sa partie sup\u00e9rieure. Le bateau devait donc \u00eatre \u00e0 seulement 20 pieds de l\u2019ar\u00eate sud de la digue lorsque feu Mme Hendricks, qui pilotait, et les deux autres occupants se sont rendu compte de leur situation. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait remarquer, il \u00e9tait alors impossible d\u2019\u00e9viter la catastrophe, surtout apr\u00e8s la tentative de feu Mme Hendricks de faire demi-tour, ce qui avait plac\u00e9 l\u2019embarcation en travers du courant pr\u00e9cipit\u00e9. Je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019inattention du p\u00e9titionnaire et de feu Mme Hendricks et leur d\u00e9faut de garder la ma\u00eetrise du bateau au cours du trajet depuis le point o\u00f9 ils ont fait demi-tour jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019instant o\u00f9 ils ont compris trop tard le danger constituent une n\u00e9gligence qui leur est imputable.\nJe ne suis pas d\u2019avis, cependant, qu\u2019il soit possible de dissocier cette n\u00e9gligence de celle que j\u2019ai fait ressortir plus haut et qui est imputable \u00e0 la Couronne. C\u2019est l\u2019omission de remplacer les \u00e9criteaux de signalisation qui a amen\u00e9 le p\u00e9titionnaire \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter ce qui s\u2019est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 une man\u0153uvre funeste et qui lui a fait croire que feu Mme Hendricks pouvait passer sous le pont sans danger. La n\u00e9gligence des deux parties a, \u00e0 mon avis, contribu\u00e9 simultan\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019accident.\nJe suis \u00e9galement d\u2019avis que la n\u00e9gligence du p\u00e9titionnaire et celle de feu Mme Hendricks se confondent. C\u2019est le p\u00e9titionnaire qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de passer sous le pont et qui a dit \u00e0 sa femme de le faire. C\u2019est le p\u00e9titionnaire qui s\u2019est assis tourn\u00e9 vers l\u2019arri\u00e8re et qui n\u2019a pas exerc\u00e9 la surveillance appropri\u00e9e qui lui aurait permis de se rendre compte \u00e0 temps du danger. Toutefois, feu Mme Hendricks, qui avait connaissance des m\u00eames faits que son mari, a conduit l\u2019embarcation et elle aussi a manqu\u00e9 d\u2019apporter la surveillance attentive qui s\u2019imposait. Ils ont commis une n\u00e9gligence commune. En cons\u00e9quence comme le p\u00e9titionnaire r\u00e9clame tant en son nom personnel qu\u2019en qualit\u00e9 d\u2019administrateur de la succession de feu son \u00e9pouse, j\u2019appliquerais la loi dite The Tortfeasors and Contributory Negligence Act, S.R.M. 1954, c. 266. Je suis d\u2019avis que les faits que j\u2019ai soulign\u00e9s motivent l\u2019imputation \u00e0 parts \u00e9gales de la n\u00e9gligence au p\u00e9titionnaire et \u00e0 la Couronne.\nLe savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance, tout en refusant d\u2019accorder des dommages, a, comme il convient, \u00e9tabli de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9taill\u00e9e le montant des dommages qu\u2019il aurait accord\u00e9s s\u2019il avait conclu autrement sur la question de la responsabilit\u00e9. Il fixe ce montant comme suit:\n[TRADUCTION]\n(1) Dommages sp\u00e9cifiques en faveur du p\u00e9titionnaire pour avarie \u00e0 son bateau et perte de biens personnels...........................\n$ 670.00\n(2) Dommages g\u00e9n\u00e9raux en faveur du p\u00e9titionnaire, en son nom personnel...........\nN\u00e9ant\n(3) Dommages sp\u00e9cifiques en vertu de la loi dite The Trustee Act pour frais fun\u00e9raires.......................................................\n929.11\n(4) Dommages g\u00e9n\u00e9raux en vertu des lois dites The Fatal Accidents Act et The Trustee Act pour pertes p\u00e9cuniaires au p\u00e9titionnaire et \u00e0 sa fille...............................\n20,000.00\n(5) Dommages g\u00e9n\u00e9raux en vertu de la loi dite The Trustee Act pour souffrances et perte d\u2019expectative de vie............................\n2,500.00 L\u2019avocat du p\u00e9titionnaire a convenu que les dommages accord\u00e9s par le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance sous le chef n\u00b0 5 sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 inclus sous le chef n\u00b0 4.

Le 25 septembre 1960, un dimanche soir apr\u00e8s la tomb\u00e9e du jour l\u2019appelant, un cultivateur, circulait en voiture \u00e0 St-Narcisse de Lotbini\u00e8re dans le chemin du rang Ste-Anne. Ce chemin vicinal avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment pav\u00e9 en asphalte sur une largeur de 22 pieds. On n\u2019y voyait pas la ligne blanche qui marque le centre des grands chemins. De chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9, il y avait un accotement gravel\u00e9 dont le t\u00e9moin Wilfrid Gagn\u00e9 qui l\u2019a mesur\u00e9, fixe la largeur \u00e0 quatre pieds. La voiture de l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait une plateforme de six pieds de largeur environ install\u00e9e sur des roues d\u2019automobile qu\u2019elle d\u00e9bordait d\u2019environ cinq pouces de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9. Ce v\u00e9hicule \u00e9tait tir\u00e9 par un cheval qui marchait \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00eame droite du pavage, les deux roues du c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit roulant sur l\u2019accotement de gravier. La voiture occupait donc quatre ou cinq pieds de la partie pav\u00e9e du chemin. Elle n\u2019\u00e9tait munie d\u2019aucun \u00e9clairage ou r\u00e9flecteur. L\u2019appelant \u00e9tait assis du c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche, son fils du c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit et il y avait en outre deux petits gar\u00e7ons de huit \u00e0 dix ans. L\u2019appelant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00abfaire le train\u00bb sur la ferme de son fils et s\u2019en revenait \u00e0 la sienne, neuf arpents \u00e0 l\u2019est de l\u2019autre. La voiture servait uniquement au transport de ses quatre occupants.\nQuant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, il revenait de Drummondville en automobile et se rendait chez lui \u00e0 St\u2011Narcisse se dirigeant dans le m\u00eame sens que l\u2019appelant. Il connaissait parfaitement les lieux car il utilisait cette route tous les jours pour se rendre \u00e0 son travail \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec et en revenir. Il convient de noter qu\u2019il travaillait de nuit partant le soir vers 8 h. 30 revenant le matin vers 7 h. 30. Cependant ce soir-l\u00e0, un dimanche, il revenait chez lui apr\u00e8s avoir mang\u00e9 en route. Il circulait phares allum\u00e9s et vit venir en sens inverse une autre automobile. Alors qu\u2019il en \u00e9tait encore \u00e9loign\u00e9 de quatre ou cinq arpents, il baissa ses phares et l\u2019autre en fit autant. Aussit\u00f4t apr\u00e8s l\u2019avoir crois\u00e9, il les releva et aper\u00e7ut le v\u00e9hicule de l\u2019appelant. Il donna un coup de volant \u00e0 gauche et mit les freins mais sans r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 \u00e9viter la collision. Son \u00e9pouse assise \u00e0 sa droite fut tu\u00e9e sur le coup par une planche de la plateforme qui d\u00e9fon\u00e7a le pare-brise. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, il eut la jambe gauche fracass\u00e9e et on dut l\u2019amputer au-dessus du genou. Sa jambe droite fut \u00e9galement bless\u00e9e et il est d\u00e9finitivement incapable de travailler comme cons\u00e9quence de l\u2019accident.\nSaisie de la poursuite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et de la demande reconventionnelle de l\u2019appelant, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure (Wilfrid Girouard J.) a jug\u00e9 les deux parties en faute, l\u2019intim\u00e9 de n\u2019avoir pas diminu\u00e9 sa vitesse \u00e0 l\u2019approche de l\u2019autre automobile, l\u2019appelant d\u2019avoir circul\u00e9 sans lumi\u00e8re. Il a fix\u00e9 les pourcentages de responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9coulant de ces fautes \u00e0 40 pour cent et 60 pour cent respectivement. Ensuite, il a estim\u00e9 \u00e0 $30,000 le pr\u00e9judice d\u00e9coulant du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de l\u2019\u00e9pouse de l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9e de 21 ans, enceinte et m\u00e8re d\u2019une fille de deux ans ainsi que d\u2019un fils de dix mois, attribuant $20,000 au demandeur personnellement et $10,000 en sa qualit\u00e9 de tuteur. Par contre, il a fix\u00e9 \u00e0 $15,000 l\u2019estimation du pr\u00e9judice subi par l\u2019appelant pour incapacit\u00e9 permanente. Avec l\u2019addition des autres chefs de dommages la r\u00e9clamation totale de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9e \u00e0 $31,126.60 et celle de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 $20,469.70. Une fois la compensation effectu\u00e9e suivant les proportions de responsabilit\u00e9, l\u2019appelant s\u2019est trouv\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 payer $8,187.88 avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 compter du 23 janvier 1961.\nLa Cour d\u2019appel[2] a rejet\u00e9 le pourvoi de l\u2019appelant, le juge Badeaux dissident \u00e9tant cependant d\u2019avis que l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre jug\u00e9 seul responsable de l\u2019accident parce que l\u2019appelant laissait aux autres v\u00e9hicules un espace suffisant et n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenu d\u2019avoir soit une lumi\u00e8re, soit un r\u00e9flecteur, \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re de son v\u00e9hicule.\nSur cette question, l\u2019appelant a fait observer que quelques mois avant l\u2019accident, la l\u00e9gislature avait compl\u00e8tement revis\u00e9 les dispositions du Code de la route au sujet des feux et r\u00e9flecteurs (8-9 Eliz. II, c. 67, art. 24). Comme les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, le nouveau texte prescrit des feux rouges \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re des v\u00e9hicules automobiles et remorques et exige aussi un feu rouge ou un r\u00e9flecteur \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re de tout bicycle ou tricycle, mais il ne pr\u00e9voit rien de tel pour les v\u00e9hicules \u00e0 traction animale.\nFaut-il en conclure que le fait de circuler la nuit avec une voiture \u00e0 traction animale d\u00e9pourvue d\u2019un feu ou d\u2019un r\u00e9flecteur ne saurait constituer une faute? Je ne le crois pas. Il ne s\u2019agit pas, comme on le sugg\u00e8re, de se substituer \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislature pour cr\u00e9er une obligation que cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019est toujours refus\u00e9e \u00e0 imposer. Sans m\u00e9conna\u00eetre sa tr\u00e8s grande importance du point de vue de la responsabilit\u00e9 civile, l\u2019article du Code de la route est essentiellement une disposition r\u00e9glementaire sanctionn\u00e9e par une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9. Il est \u00e9vident que tant que la l\u00e9gislature n\u2019y ajoutera pas une disposition applicable au cas dont il s\u2019agit, les gendarmes ne pourront pas dresser de contraventions \u00e0 ce sujet et les tribunaux correctionnels ne pourront pas imposer de peines. Cela ne signifie pas que les tribunaux civils ne peuvent pas juger qu\u2019il y a faute car les dispositions r\u00e9glementaires n\u2019\u00e9puisent pas la liste des obligations qui incombent aux citoyens.\nDepuis plus de trente ans, la jurisprudence des tribunaux du Qu\u00e9bec consid\u00e8re comme une imprudence fautive le fait de circuler le soir dans un chemin public avec une voiture \u00e0 traction animale qui n\u2019est pas munie d\u2019un feu ou d\u2019un r\u00e9flecteur. Je ne vois pas de raison de d\u00e9cider autrement. Il y a bien au dossier une preuve que dans la localit\u00e9 cette imprudence est g\u00e9n\u00e9rale mais cela n\u2019est pas suffisant pour que l\u2019on doive consid\u00e9rer qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un cas o\u00f9 il faut appliquer la r\u00e8gle retenue dans The London & Lancashire c. La Compagnie F.X. Drolet[3], savoir que l\u2019on se disculpe d\u2019une imputation de faute en d\u00e9montrant que l\u2019on s\u2019est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019usage g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement observ\u00e9 et approuv\u00e9. Cet usage d\u00e9plorable pour autant qu\u2019il subsiste ne peut plus \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00abapprouv\u00e9\u00bb en face des nombreuses d\u00e9cisions judiciaires qui l\u2019ont uniform\u00e9ment condamn\u00e9 depuis trente ans. Cette conclusion suffit \u00e0 disposer de la cause. Nous avons pour r\u00e8gle de ne pas intervenir \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de jugements concordants sur une question de fait \u00e0 moins d\u2019une erreur manifeste dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve. Il ne m\u2019est pas possible de venir \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019une telle erreur a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise dans le partage de la responsabilit\u00e9 et l\u2019estimation du pr\u00e9judice. Sur ces deux questions, il ne faut pas rechercher si si\u00e9geant en premi\u00e8re instance nous en serions venus aux m\u00eames chiffres que le premier juge mais bien s\u2019il a fait une appr\u00e9ciation enti\u00e8rement erron\u00e9e de la preuve. C\u2019est ce que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9.\nL\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs du d\u00e9fendeur, appelant: Marquis, Marceau & Jessop, Qu\u00e9bec.\nProcureurs du demandeur, intim\u00e9: Gagnon, de Billy, Cantin & Dionne, Qu\u00e9bec.\n[1] [1965] B.R. 98.\n[2] [1965] B.R. 98.\n[3] [1944] R.C.S. 82, [1944] 1 D.L.R. 561.",

La police l\u2019a trouv\u00e9 dans une chambre d\u2019h\u00f4tel, au lit avec un autre homme, un travesti, et leur position respective l\u2019un par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019autre \u00e9tait telle que la police \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e de penser qu\u2019un acte de grossi\u00e8re ind\u00e9cence avait lieu ou \u00e9tait sur le point d\u2019avoir lieu. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a sembl\u00e9 stup\u00e9fi\u00e9 apr\u00e8s l\u2019arriv\u00e9e des policiers et pendant la conversation qui a suivi. Sa d\u00e9fense, c\u2019est qu\u2019il a cru que son compagnon \u00e9tait une femme. A l\u2019appui de son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, il a offert celui d\u2019un psychiatre. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9cart\u00e9 la preuve psychiatrique, fond\u00e9e sur les interviews et les tests, laquelle \u00e9tait offerte dans le but de montrer que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait un certain m\u00e9canisme de d\u00e9fense qui le faisait r\u00e9agir violemment \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de toute activit\u00e9 homosexuelle et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, il ne se serait pas engag\u00e9, sciemment, dans les relations sexuelles qui font l\u2019objet de l\u2019inculpation. La majorit\u00e9 en Cour d\u2019appel a jug\u00e9 la preuve recevable, a \u00e9cart\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 et a ordonn\u00e9 un nouveau proc\u00e8s. La Couronne en a appel\u00e9 \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre accueilli et la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9tablie, les Juges Ritchie et Spence \u00e9tant dissidents.\nLes Juges Martland et Judson: La preuve en question \u00e9tait irrecevable. On a demand\u00e9 au psychiatre de donner une opinion non sur la capacit\u00e9 intellectuelle chez l\u2019intim\u00e9 de former l\u2019intention de commettre le crime mais sur la question de savoir s\u2019il a, les faits \u00e9tant ce qu\u2019ils sont, v\u00e9ritablement eu cette intention. Il n\u2019y a aucun pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent qui d\u00e9montre qu\u2019un psychiatre peut t\u00e9moigner de cette fa\u00e7on. Ce qu\u2019on veut faire ici, c\u2019est permettre \u00e0 un expert de donner son avis sur la question de l\u2019intention du pr\u00e9venu en se fondant sur une preuve qui n\u2019est pas faite devant le jury et qui consiste en partie d\u2019une preuve de ou\u00ef-dire provenant de l\u2019inculp\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame. La d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans l\u2019affaire Wilband c. R., [1967] R.C.S. 14, ne contredit pas cette conclusion.\nLe Juge Hall: Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance aurait d\u00fb admettre toute la preuve que le psychiatre voulait pr\u00e9senter. Quelles que soient les autres causes de l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019homosexualit\u00e9, les facteurs psychologiques jouent un tr\u00e8s grand r\u00f4le. Il s\u2019ensuit que les t\u00e9moignages de psychiatres sont particuli\u00e8rement appropri\u00e9s dans des affaires o\u00f9 il est question d\u2019homosexualit\u00e9. C\u2019est sa pertinence \u00e0 l\u2019objet du proc\u00e8s qui doit d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert fourni par des psychiatres. La preuve \u00e9tait pertinente \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense qu\u2019on voulait pr\u00e9senter pour le compte de l\u2019intim\u00e9; elle \u00e9tait alors admissible et le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a fait une erreur en la refusant.\nCependant, il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019une affaire o\u00f9 les dispositions de l\u2019art. 592(1)(b)(iii) du Code criminel doivent s\u2019appliquer. La preuve \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du pr\u00e9venu \u00e9tait accablante et le verdict aurait n\u00e9cessairement \u00e9t\u00e9 le m\u00eame, m\u00eame si le jury avait entendu l\u2019opinion que le psychiatre voulait pr\u00e9senter.\nLes Juges Ritchie et Spence, dissidents: Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance aurait d\u00fb admettre la preuve en question. Le fait que les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s employ\u00e9s par le psychiatre pour se former une opinion d\u00e9pendent n\u00e9cessairement d\u2019informations obtenues de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou d\u2019autres personnes, hors la pr\u00e9sence du jury, ne rend point cette opinion irrecevable, bien qu\u2019il puisse \u00eatre un facteur \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration en \u00e9valuant sa force probante. L\u2019on n\u2019aurait pas enfreint la r\u00e8gle contre le ou\u00ef-dire en permettant la preuve de l\u2019opinion psychiatrique que l\u2019on voulait demander au psychiatre de fournir sur l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019esprit normal de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le dossier d\u00e9montre que la preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans le but de faire conna\u00eetre l\u2019opinion du m\u00e9decin selon laquelle cet homme-l\u00e0 poss\u00e9derait un genre de m\u00e9canisme de d\u00e9fense qui le fait r\u00e9agir violemment \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de toute conduite homosexuelle.

Si un tel avis est pertinent, et tel est le cas dans une affaire comme celle-ci, il doit \u00eatre recevable dans un proc\u00e8s comme celui-ci, m\u00eame s\u2019il am\u00e8ne le psychiatre \u00e0 exprimer l\u2019avis que l\u2019inculp\u00e9 ne poss\u00e8de pas la capacit\u00e9 de commettre le crime dont il est accus\u00e9.\nAPPEL de la Couronne d\u2019un jugement majoritaire de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique[1], \u00e9cartant la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et ordonnant un nouveau proc\u00e8s.

Les agents de police ont \u00e9cout\u00e9 pendant quelques minutes devant la porte verrouill\u00e9e. Ils ont entendu des voix d\u2019hommes qui parlaient en fran\u00e7ais. S\u2019\u00e9tant procur\u00e9s la clef de la chambre aupr\u00e8s du gar\u00e7on de nuit de l\u2019h\u00f4tel, les agents sont entr\u00e9s et ont trouv\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 et l\u2019autre personne nus sur un lit. Ils ont constat\u00e9 que l\u2019autre personne \u00e9tait un homme, encore affubl\u00e9 de la perruque blonde de femme et de l\u2019\u00e9pais maquillage qu\u2019on lui avait vu plus t\u00f4t. Bien que les agents de police n\u2019aient pas vu les deux personnes couch\u00e9es faire quoi que ce soit, au moment o\u00f9 ils sont entr\u00e9s la posture de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait telle que sa t\u00eate se trouvait tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s des organes g\u00e9nitaux de celui qui \u00e9tait travesti en femme. Les agents ont vu l\u2019intim\u00e9 changer de position en se retournant vivement dans le lit. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a sembl\u00e9 stup\u00e9fi\u00e9 apr\u00e8s l\u2019arriv\u00e9e des policiers et pendant la conversation qui a suivi avec eux.\nLa d\u00e9fense de l\u2019intim\u00e9 c\u2019est qu\u2019il a cru que son compagnon \u00e9tait une femme.\nLa question de droit \u00e0 d\u00e9cider par le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi est l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de la preuve psychiatrique offerte de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 irrecevable, mais la majorit\u00e9 en Cour d\u2019appel l\u2019a jug\u00e9 recevable.\nL\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9crit comme suit le caract\u00e8re de la preuve qu\u2019il voulait pr\u00e9senter dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 qu\u2019il a fait \u00e0 la Cour au proc\u00e8s:\n[TRADUCTION] Le but que je veux atteindre en offrant cette preuve est de faire d\u00e9crire par le m\u00e9decin l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019esprit normal de M. Lupien, et d\u2019apr\u00e8s cette description lui faire comparer cet \u00e9tat d\u2019esprit normal avec les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s dans la chambre. Lorsque cela aura \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, le m\u00e9decin aura une norme sur laquelle il pourra \u00e9tayer son opinion. Voil\u00e0 fondamentalement la base sur laquelle je pr\u00e9sente cette preuve.\nL\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a alors expos\u00e9 la nature et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la preuve psychiatrique qu\u2019il entendait pr\u00e9senter, comme suit:\n[TRADUCTION] Le m\u00e9decin dira que cet homme a un genre de m\u00e9canisme de d\u00e9fense qui le fait r\u00e9agir violemment \u00e0 tout ce qui est associ\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019homosexualit\u00e9. Il dira que c\u2019est l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019esprit normal. Il confrontera alors cette opinion avec les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui sont survenus cette nuit-l\u00e0 et il dira: \u00abConsid\u00e9rant les deux ensemble et compte tenu de l\u2019effet de l\u2019un sur l\u2019autre, je suis de l\u2019avis suivant, savoir: il doit avoir cru que cette personne \u00e9tait une femme\u00bb, et en autant que sa facult\u00e9 de perception \u00e9tait diminu\u00e9e par ce que j\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 dans la question hypoth\u00e9tique, car sa facult\u00e9 de perception \u00e9tait diminu\u00e9e, il s\u2019est produit l\u2019une des deux choses suivantes, ou il n\u2019a pas per\u00e7u consciemment les organes g\u00e9nitaux qu\u2019il voyait devant lui, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 m\u00eame de r\u00e9aliser que cette personne \u00e9tait un homme, ou aussit\u00f4t qu\u2019il s\u2019en est rendu compte il l\u2019a rejet\u00e9 et il est inconcevable qu\u2019il ne l\u2019ait pas rejet\u00e9.\nL\u2019examen psychiatrique exigeait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 fournisse certains renseignements. Le psychiatre a dit \u00e0 ce sujet:\n[TRADUCTION] C\u2019est l\u00e0 o\u00f9 je dois pr\u00e9sumer de la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de ce qu\u2019il dit sur ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents, ses attitudes, ses sentiments, ses convictions et tout ce qui peut me permettre de me faire une id\u00e9e ou une opinion sur le genre de personne qu\u2019est cet homme fonci\u00e8rement. Pour ce qui est de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question de savoir quel \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019esprit de cet homme \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, ou de savoir ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, ou de savoir ce qu\u2019il pensait \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, non, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de me fier \u00e0 la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de ce qu\u2019il a dit.\nEssentiellement, l\u2019opinion serait \u00e0 l\u2019effet que, si l\u2019on se fonde sur l\u2019examen psychiatrique, la d\u00e9fense de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessairement vraie.\nDans les proc\u00e8s criminels, on pr\u00e9sente le plus souvent une preuve psychiatrique lorsqu\u2019on invoque la d\u00e9fense d\u2019ali\u00e9nation mentale. Il s\u2019agit alors de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019\u00e9tat mental et les t\u00e9moignages d\u2019experts sur les maladies mentales sont tout \u00e0 fait pertinents et admissibles.\nDans les demandes en vertu de l\u2019art. 661 du Code criminel, o\u00f9 il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9cider si l\u2019accus\u00e9 est un d\u00e9linquant sexuel dangereux, la Cour doit entendre le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019au moins deux psychiatres. Cette disposition existe semble-t-il parce que l\u2019on demande \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appr\u00e9cier la probabilit\u00e9 d\u2019un comportement particulier dans l\u2019avenir. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de d\u00e9cider si une personne est coupable d\u2019un crime. C\u2019\u00e9tait au sujet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate de ce genre que le Juge Fauteux, en exposant les motifs de la Cour dans l\u2019affaire Wilband c. La Reine[3], a d\u00e9fini les sources admissibles de renseignements dont le psychiatre peut se servir, y compris les renseignements obtenus par ou\u00ef-dire. Dans l\u2019affaire Fisher c. La Reine[4], il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une accusation de meurtre et la d\u00e9fense \u00e9tait que l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait trop ivre pour \u00eatre capable de former l\u2019intention n\u00e9cessaire. La preuve de la poursuite consistait principalement en une d\u00e9claration de l\u2019accus\u00e9, o\u00f9 il rendait compte de ses all\u00e9es et venues avant et apr\u00e8s l\u2019assassinat, d\u00e9claration qu\u2019il a reconnue. On a permis de pr\u00e9senter une preuve psychiatrique dans cette affaire, afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir la capacit\u00e9 intellectuelle de l\u2019accus\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s avoir lu la d\u00e9claration de l\u2019accus\u00e9, le t\u00e9moin \u00e0 une question hypoth\u00e9tique renfermant en substance les faits essentiels mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration, a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019\u00e0 son avis toute personne capable de faire ce que l\u2019accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 avoir fait, \u00e9tait capable de former l\u2019intention de commettre un meurtre, m\u00eame si elle avait bu 25 verres de bi\u00e8re ou plus.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 pour cause d\u2019ali\u00e9nation mentale, d\u2019ivresse ou autrement de former l\u2019intention de commettre le crime dont il est accus\u00e9. La preuve que l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 voulait pr\u00e9senter ne tendait pas \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que ce dernier \u00e9tait mentalement incapable de former l\u2019intention de commettre le crime dont il \u00e9tait accus\u00e9. Le but de cette preuve \u00e9tait d\u2019\u00e9tablir, en se fondant en partie sur ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait dit au t\u00e9moin, que, parce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 r\u00e9agissait normalement de fa\u00e7on violente aux pratiques homosexuelles, il disait certainement la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 quand, dans les circonstances o\u00f9 on l\u2019a trouv\u00e9 et dont on a fait la preuve, il a dit avoir cru que son compagnon \u00e9tait une femme. En d\u2019autres mots, on demande au psychiatre de donner une opinion non sur la capacit\u00e9 intellectuelle chez l\u2019intim\u00e9 de former une telle intention mais sur la question de savoir s\u2019il a, les faits \u00e9tant ce qu\u2019ils sont, v\u00e9ritablement eu cette intention. On ne nous a cit\u00e9 aucun pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent ni au Canada, ni en Angleterre, qui d\u00e9montre qu\u2019un psychiatre peut t\u00e9moigner de cette fa\u00e7on. Si un tel t\u00e9moignage est tenu pour admissible dans une affaire de ce genre, il ne semble y avoir aucune raison qui emp\u00eacherait dans le cas d\u2019une accusation de meurtre, de pr\u00e9senter une preuve psychiatrique \u00e0 l\u2019effet que le pr\u00e9venu a une aversion inn\u00e9e pour la violence physique, ou dans le cas d\u2019une accusation de vol qu\u2019il a un respect inn\u00e9 du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019autrui.\nJe suis d\u2019accord avec l\u2019opinion exprim\u00e9e par le Juge en chef Davey \u00e0 ce sujet:\n[TRADUCTION] Il est trop dangereux dans les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de cette affaire de permettre la preuve de l\u2019opinion que Lupien n\u2019aurait pas sciemment pos\u00e9 les actes qu\u2019on lui impute parce que, sans n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, elle vient trop pr\u00e8s de la conclusion m\u00eame que le jury doit tirer de la preuve.\nLe jury doit juger de l\u2019intention de l\u2019inculp\u00e9 d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve qui lui est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Ce qu\u2019on veut faire ici, c\u2019est permettre \u00e0 un expert de donner son avis sur cette question en se fondant sur une preuve qui n\u2019est pas faite devant le jury et qui consiste en partie d\u2019une preuve de ou\u00ef\u2011dire provenant de l\u2019inculp\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame. A mon avis, une preuve de ce genre ne doit pas \u00eatre admise.\nJe ne consid\u00e8re pas que la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans l\u2019affaire Wilband (d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9e) contredise cette conclusion. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, la preuve psychiatrique dont il est question dans cette affaire-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait requise pour une demande en vertu de l\u2019art. 661(2) du Code criminel visant \u00e0 faire d\u00e9cider si le pr\u00e9venu d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable \u00e9tait un d\u00e9linquant sexuel dangereux. Cette d\u00e9cision n\u00e9cessitait une audition sur la question de savoir si le pr\u00e9venu \u00e9tait un individu qui causerait vraisemblablement une l\u00e9sion corporelle, une douleur ou un autre mal \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un \u00e0 cause de son impuissance \u00e0 ma\u00eetriser ses impulsions sexuelles, ou qui commettrait vraisemblablement une autre infraction d\u2019ordre sexuel. Sur cette question, le Parlement a exig\u00e9 que la Cour ait l\u2019avantage d\u2019entendre le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019au moins deux psychiatres. Dans l\u2019affaire Wilband, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que ces derniers, pour leur t\u00e9moignage avaient le droit de se former une opinion selon les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s psychiatriques reconnus et de prendre en consid\u00e9ration toutes les sources possibles d\u2019information.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, il s\u2019agit de statuer sur la culpabilit\u00e9 en se fondant sur des faits prouv\u00e9s qui existent d\u00e9j\u00e0 et non de pr\u00e9voir un comportement \u00e0 venir. Le Code n\u2019exige pas dans ce cas-ci qu\u2019on entende le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un psychiatre. On cherche \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter ce t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert sur la question m\u00eame que le jury doit juger, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise.\nPour ces motifs, je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi et de r\u00e9tablir la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 et la sentence.\nLe jugement des Juges Ritchie et Spence a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par\nLE JUGE RITCHIE (dissident)\u2014Ce pourvoi est introduit par le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Colombie-Britannique, en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019art. 598(1)(a) du Code Criminel, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique[5] (le Juge en chef Davey dissident). Cet arr\u00eat \u00e9carte la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour tentative de perp\u00e9trer un acte de grossi\u00e8re ind\u00e9cence, et ordonne un nouveau proc\u00e8s sur ce seul chef d\u2019accusation.\nLa police a trouv\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans une chambre d\u2019h\u00f4tel, au lit avec un autre homme, un travesti, et il n\u2019y a aucun doute, \u00e0 mon avis, que leur position respective l\u2019un par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019autre \u00e9tait telle que la police \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e de penser qu\u2019un acte de grossi\u00e8re ind\u00e9cence avait lieu ou \u00e9tait sur le point d\u2019avoir lieu.\nLa d\u00e9fense principale de l\u2019intim\u00e9 c\u2019est qu\u2019il a toujours cru, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019instant m\u00eame qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 l\u2019entr\u00e9e des policiers dans la chambre, que son compagnon \u00e9tait une femme. A l\u2019appui de son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a offert celui du docteur Newman, psychiatre hautement qualifi\u00e9, qui a assist\u00e9 \u00e0 tout le proc\u00e8s, a eu des entrevues avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 et d\u2019autres personnes, et a soumis l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 certains tests psychiatriques dans le but de d\u00e9terminer son attitude normale envers le sexe.\nLe substitut a soulev\u00e9 une objection \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cette preuve par le Dr Newman. Apr\u00e8s une longue argumentation des avocats des deux parties, le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019interrogatoire par l\u2019avocat de la d\u00e9fense \u00e0 ce sujet devait se limiter \u00e0 poser au m\u00e9decin une question hypoth\u00e9tique: En supposant la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de la preuve fournie au proc\u00e8s et se reportant au moment o\u00f9, aux petites heures du matin, les policiers ont trouv\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans une position compromettante, quelle est son opinion au sujet de l\u2019effet produit sur l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019esprit de l\u2019intim\u00e9 par le manque de sommeil, un programme de travail charg\u00e9 et la consommation d\u2019alcool?\nLe savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a toutefois \u00e9cart\u00e9 la preuve psychiatrique fond\u00e9e sur les entrevues et les tests laquelle \u00e9tait offerte dans le but de montrer que, de l\u2019avis du docteur Newman, Lupien avait un certain m\u00e9canisme de d\u00e9fense qui le faisait r\u00e9agir violemment \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de toute activit\u00e9 homosexuelle et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, il ne se serait pas engag\u00e9, sciemment, dans les relations homosexuelles qui font l\u2019objet de l\u2019inculpation.\nLes membres de la Cour d\u2019appel ont, \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9, \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis que l\u2019opinion du m\u00e9decin, avanc\u00e9e en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question hypoth\u00e9tique qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre admise en preuve. Je suis aussi de cet avis. Mais la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour, en ordonnant un nouveau proc\u00e8s, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance s\u2019est tromp\u00e9 en refusant d\u2019admettre en preuve l\u2019opinion du m\u00e9decin, fond\u00e9e sur les entrevues qu\u2019il avait eues ainsi que sur les tests et proc\u00e9d\u00e9s psychiatriques auxquels il avait soumis l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le pourvoi est bas\u00e9 sur la dissidence du savant Juge en chef au sujet de cette derni\u00e8re question.\nEn rejetant l\u2019opinion formul\u00e9e par le m\u00e9decin par suite de ses propres recherches et tests, le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a cit\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans Bleta c. La Reine[6] o\u00f9 il est dit, \u00e0 la page 564:\n[TRADUCTION] La question de savoir si un pr\u00e9venu \u00e9tait dans un \u00e9tat d\u2019automatisme tel qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u00e9galement responsable au moment o\u00f9 il a commis les actes dont il est accus\u00e9 est une question de fait. C\u2019est peut-\u00eatre en v\u00e9rit\u00e9 la question de fait la plus importante dans une affaire criminelle et c\u2019est parce que l\u2019opinion d\u2019un t\u00e9moin expert sur une telle question ne peut servir qu\u2019\u00e0 jeter la confusion dans les esprits \u00e0 moins que les faits prouv\u00e9s sur lesquels elle est bas\u00e9e n\u2019aient \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement expos\u00e9s au jury, que l\u2019usage s\u2019est \u00e9tabli d\u2019obliger l\u2019avocat recherchant une telle opinion \u00e0 exposer les faits sous la forme d\u2019une question hypoth\u00e9tique.\nDans l\u2019affaire Bleta c. La Reine, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, il s\u2019agissait de d\u00e9cider de quelle fa\u00e7on on doit solliciter d\u2019un t\u00e9moin expert une opinion fond\u00e9e sur la preuve faite au proc\u00e8s en sa pr\u00e9sence. La phrase prise dans le jugement de cette Cour qui est cit\u00e9e par le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance, est imm\u00e9diatement suivie, dans le m\u00eame alin\u00e9a, par ce qui suit:\n[TRADUCTION] Dans les affaires o\u00f9 l\u2019expert est pr\u00e9sent tout au long du proc\u00e8s, il n\u2019est \u00e9videmment pas satisfaisant de lui demander de formuler une opinion fond\u00e9e sur les t\u00e9moignages qu\u2019il a entendus lorsque ceux-ci sont contradictoires, parce que la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une telle question entra\u00eene l\u2019expert \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre la contradiction selon son appr\u00e9ciation personnelle de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins. Le jury n\u2019a alors aucun moyen de savoir sur quelle preuve il fonde son opinion. Toutefois, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il n\u2019y a pas de t\u00e9moignages contradictoires, la m\u00eame difficult\u00e9 ne se pr\u00e9sente pas n\u00e9cessairement et d\u2019autres motifs peuvent donc \u00eatre \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer.\nL\u2019affaire Bleta est venue devant cette Cour par suite d\u2019un pourvoi \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ontario, qui avait accueilli un appel du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et ordonn\u00e9 un nouveau proc\u00e8s, pour le motif, entre autres, qu\u2019un m\u00e9decin cit\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin par la d\u00e9fense [TRADUCTION] \u00abavait \u00e9t\u00e9 ind\u00fbment autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 exprimer une opinion fond\u00e9e sur son appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve\u00bb. Il n\u2019est aucunement question de cela dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire et je ne crois pas que l\u2019affaire Bleta puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ayant \u00e9tabli qu\u2019un avocat ne peut demander \u00e0 un m\u00e9decin au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 d\u2019une personne, une opinion bas\u00e9e sur ses connaissances m\u00e9dicales et sur des questions qu\u2019il a pos\u00e9es au patient hors la pr\u00e9sence du jury.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, on a pr\u00e9tendu que l\u2019opinion du Dr Newman sur la r\u00e9action normale de l\u2019intim\u00e9 aux avances homosexuelles est irrecevable parce qu\u2019elle irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la r\u00e8gle que l\u2019on ne peut faire de preuve par ou\u00ef-dire, vu qu\u2019elle est n\u00e9cessairement fond\u00e9e sur ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 et d\u2019autres personnes lui ont dit au cours des entrevues qu\u2019il a eues et sur les r\u00e9sultats des tests qu\u2019il a faits. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 des d\u00e9clarations faites au m\u00e9decin au cours de son examen psychiatrique n\u2019est aucunement en question. Ce que l\u2019on recherchait ici, c\u2019est un t\u00e9moignage exposant l\u2019opinion \u00e0 laquelle le m\u00e9decin \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 par l\u2019application de ses connaissances m\u00e9dicales \u00e0 une analyse des tendances de l\u2019intim\u00e9, telles que manifest\u00e9es par ses propos, attitudes et r\u00e9actions lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 un interrogatoire, et \u00e0 d\u2019autres proc\u00e9d\u00e9s psychiatriques destin\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9v\u00e9ler son vrai caract\u00e8re. C\u2019est la recevabilit\u00e9 d\u2019une opinion obtenue de cette fa\u00e7on qui est en litige ici. A mon avis, le fait que les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s employ\u00e9s par le psychiatre pour se former une opinion d\u00e9pendent n\u00e9cessairement d\u2019informations obtenues de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou d\u2019autres personnes, hors la pr\u00e9sence du jury, ne rend point cette opinion irrecevable, bien qu\u2019il puisse \u00eatre un facteur \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration en \u00e9valuant la force probante de cette opinion. S\u2019il en \u00e9tait autrement, les tribunaux seraient priv\u00e9s d\u2019un nombre important d\u2019opinions m\u00e9dicales fond\u00e9es sur des m\u00e9thodes cliniques de diagnostic.\nDans l\u2019affaire Wilband c. La Reine[7], on a pr\u00e9tendu que certains t\u00e9moignages donn\u00e9s par des psychiatres, en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019art. 661(2) du Code Criminel, \u00e9taient irrecevables en ce qu\u2019ils allaient \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la r\u00e8gle du ou\u00ef-dire. M. le Juge Fauteux dit, \u00e0 la page 21 de ses motifs:\n[TRADUCTION] AU sujet du ou\u00ef-dire: dans cette affaire, la preuve indique qu\u2019afin de se former une opinion conform\u00e9ment aux proc\u00e9d\u00e9s pyschiatriques couramment reconnus, le psychiatre doit tenir compte de toutes les sources possibles d\u2019information, y compris le ou\u00ef-dire, son activit\u00e9 professionnelle normale ainsi que sa comp\u00e9tence et ses capacit\u00e9s l\u2019habilitant \u00e0 juger de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, pr\u00e9cision et signification de ses sources d\u2019information. Par cons\u00e9quent, bien qu\u2019en d\u00e9finitive sa conclusion puisse reposer, en partie, sur du ou\u00ef-dire, elle n\u2019en reste pas moins une opinion form\u00e9e selon les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s psychiatriques couramment reconnus. On ne peut supposer que le Parlement a voulu que l\u2019opinion formul\u00e9e par le psychiatre pour aider la Cour soit obtenue selon des m\u00e9thodes autres que celles qui sont reconnues dans les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s psychiatriques normaux. La valeur de l\u2019opinion avanc\u00e9e par un psychiatre peut \u00eatre amoindrie dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle est fond\u00e9e sur le ou\u00ef-dire, mais cela touche sa valeur probante et non sa recevabilit\u00e9 en preuve; en effet, cette opinion n\u2019est pas une preuve de la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 des informations, mais une preuve de l\u2019id\u00e9e faite \u00e0 partir de ces informations.\nIl est vrai que, dans l\u2019affaire Wilband, le Juge Fauteux consid\u00e9rait une preuve psychiatrique alors qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de d\u00e9cider si un inculp\u00e9 qui venait d\u2019\u00eatre condamn\u00e9 \u00e9tait un \u00abd\u00e9linquant sexuel dangereux\u00bb; c\u2019est l\u2019\u00e9tat de l\u2019accus\u00e9 plut\u00f4t que sa culpabilit\u00e9 ou son innocence qui \u00e9tait en question, mais j\u2019ai la conviction que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit dans cette affaire sur la r\u00e8gle du ou\u00ef-dire s\u2019applique avec autant de force \u00e0 la situation pr\u00e9sente.\nVu ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019on n\u2019aurait pas enfreint la r\u00e8gle contre le ou\u00ef-dire en permettant la preuve de l\u2019opinion psychiatrique que l\u2019on voulait demander au Dr Newman de fournir sur l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019esprit normal de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Cela est cependant loin de r\u00e9gler la question vu que la dissidence du savant Juge en chef se fonde sur des motifs plus larges. Dans son expos\u00e9, il dit:\n[TRADUCTION] Je rejetterais cette preuve pour ce motif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas recevable dans le but pour lequel on veut la pr\u00e9senter. Il faut comprendre clairement quel est ce but, aussi, je r\u00e9p\u00e8te qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9montrer que la personnalit\u00e9 normale de Lupien et ses m\u00e9canismes de d\u00e9fense l\u2019auraient pouss\u00e9 \u00e0 rejeter toute avance ou relation homosexuelle; ainsi, de l\u2019avis des experts, il ne s\u2019y serait pas sciemment engag\u00e9. Ils ont voulu expliquer la preuve faite en soutenant que Lupien devait avoir cru sinc\u00e8rement que Boisvert \u00e9tait une femme, ou que son intelligence et son jugement avaient d\u00e9failli. Il est trop dangereux dans les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de cette affaire de permettre la preuve de l\u2019opinion que Lupien n\u2019aurait pas sciemment pos\u00e9 les actes qu\u2019on lui impute parce que, sans n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, elle vient trop pr\u00e8s de la conclusion m\u00eame que le jury doit tirer de la preuve. Mais il y a une objection plus fondamentale. C\u2019est tout simplement qu\u2019on demandait aux m\u00e9decins de dire que Lupien \u00e9tait un homme normal, et qu\u2019en tant que tel il avait une r\u00e9pulsion instinctive envers tout acte homosexuel, de sorte qu\u2019il aurait recul\u00e9 devant l\u2019id\u00e9e de s\u2019y adonner. Ce sont les jur\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient appel\u00e9s \u00e0 dire ce qu\u2019un homme normal aurait fait dans ces circonstances, car cela d\u00e9pend de leur connaissance des hommes.\nJe partage l\u2019opinion du Juge en chef \u00e0 l\u2019effet que si la preuve avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans le but de d\u00e9montrer que Lupien est un homme normal, la conclusion \u00e0 tirer sur sa fa\u00e7on d\u2019agir en de telles circonstances aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 du domaine du jury. Mais, en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, le dossier d\u00e9montre, \u00e0 mon avis, que la preuve n\u2019a pas du tout \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans ce but, mais plut\u00f4t dans le but de faire conna\u00eetre l\u2019opinion du m\u00e9decin selon laquelle cet homme-l\u00e0 poss\u00e9derait un genre de m\u00e9canisme de d\u00e9fense qui le fait r\u00e9agir violemment \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de toute conduite homosexuelle. La preuve que le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a rejet\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite, par l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9, dans les termes suivants:\n[TRADUCTION] Or, ici le m\u00e9decin dira\u2014et je suis incapable de le dire aussi bien que lui\u2014le m\u00e9decin dira que cet homme a un genre de m\u00e9canisme de d\u00e9fense qui le fait r\u00e9agir violemment \u00e0 tout ce qui est associ\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019homosexualit\u00e9. Il dira que c\u2019est l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019esprit normal. Il confrontera alors cette opinion avec les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui sont survenus cette nuit-l\u00e0 et il dira: \u00abConsid\u00e9rant les deux ensemble, et compte tenu de l\u2019effet de l\u2019un sur l\u2019autre, je suis de l\u2019avis suivant, savoir: il doit avoir cru que cette personne \u00e9tait une femme\u00bb, et (2) en autant que sa facult\u00e9 de perception \u00e9tait diminu\u00e9e par ce que j\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 dans la question hypoth\u00e9tique, car sa facult\u00e9 de perception \u00e9tait diminu\u00e9e, il s\u2019est produit l\u2019une des deux choses suivantes, ou il n\u2019a pas per\u00e7u consciemment les organes g\u00e9nitaux qu\u2019il voyait devant lui, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 m\u00eame de r\u00e9aliser que cette personne \u00e9tait un homme, ou (2) aussit\u00f4t qu\u2019il s\u2019en est rendu compte il l\u2019a rejet\u00e9 et il est inconcevable qu\u2019il ne l\u2019ait pas rejet\u00e9.\nA mon avis, la preuve que l\u2019on voulait alors faire recevoir est l\u2019opinion du Dr Newman que l\u2019intim\u00e9 est constitu\u00e9 de telle fa\u00e7on qu\u2019il est incapable de former l\u2019intention de commettre un acte homosexuel. Il me semble que la question de savoir si un homme a ou n\u2019a pas de tendances ou penchants homosexuels en est une qui se pr\u00eate tr\u00e8s bien au diagnostic d\u2019un psychiatre, et qu\u2019une telle opinion form\u00e9e dans ce domaine de la conduite humaine est pertinente et recevable dans une affaire comme celle-ci.\nIl ne s\u2019agissait pas ici de fournir une preuve du caract\u00e8re, au sens de r\u00e9putation. Je suis d\u2019avis que la r\u00e8gle \u00e9tablie en 1865 par le Juge en chef Cockburn, dans Regina v. Rowton[8], selon laquelle la preuve du caract\u00e8re ne peut \u00eatre faite que par des t\u00e9moignages sur la r\u00e9putation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019accus\u00e9 dans le milieu auquel il appartient, est singuli\u00e8rement inapplicable \u00e0 l\u2019introduction de t\u00e9moignages de psychiatres sur les pr\u00e9dispositions du pr\u00e9venu.\nL\u2019affaire Rowton a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e bien avant que la psychiatrie ne devienne une discipline m\u00e9dicale reconnue et on ne nous a cit\u00e9 aucune affaire o\u00f9 la r\u00e8gle qu\u2019elle \u00e9tablit a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00e9carter une telle preuve.\nDans l\u2019expos\u00e9 de ses motifs en l\u2019affaire Fisher v. The Queen[9], avec lequel neuf membres de cette Cour ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00abg\u00e9n\u00e9ralement d\u2019accord\u00bb, (voir [1961] R.C.S. 535, \u00e0 la p. 538), le Juge d\u2019appel Aylesworth dit, \u00e0 la page 21, au sujet du t\u00e9moignage du psychiatre cit\u00e9 par la Couronne dans cette affaire-l\u00e0:\n[TRADUCTION] Naturellement, en supposant que les faits qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9s \u00e0 titre d\u2019hypoth\u00e8se sont vrais, il donnait son avis sur l\u2019une des questions les plus importantes soumises au jury pour d\u00e9cision, mais cela ne rend pas son avis irrecevable en soi\u2026 La psychiatrie est une branche relativement moderne et sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e de la m\u00e9decine ayant pour objet l\u2019\u00e9tude de l\u2019esprit, de son fonctionnement, et de l\u2019\u00e9tat mental de l\u2019individu, tel que r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 par sa conversation, son attitude et ses actes. Je n\u2019ai aucun doute que le Dr Easton, sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 en psychiatrie depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, et jouissant de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience que sa position exige, est qualifi\u00e9 pour formuler un avis sur la capacit\u00e9 intellectuelle d\u2019un individu tel que l\u2019appelant de former une certaine intention\u2026\nDans l\u2019affaire Fisher, le pr\u00e9venu, inculp\u00e9 de meurtre, avait fait \u00e0 la police une d\u00e9claration dans laquelle il d\u00e9crivait, par le menu, ses activit\u00e9s durant la soir\u00e9e, jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 l\u2019on pr\u00e9tendait que le meurtre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 commis. Au cours du contre-interrogatoire de certains t\u00e9moins de la poursuite, il est devenu clair qu\u2019on essayait d\u2019\u00e9tablir une d\u00e9fense d\u2019ivresse et, avant de terminer sa preuve, le minist\u00e8re public a cit\u00e9 le Dr Easton, directeur du service de psychiatrie \u00e0 l\u2019Ontario Hospital de New Toronto, et lui a pos\u00e9 une question hypoth\u00e9tique, bas\u00e9e dans une large mesure sur la d\u00e9claration du pr\u00e9venu aux policiers. En r\u00e9ponse, le Dr Easton a exprim\u00e9 l\u2019avis que toute personne capable de faire ce que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait cens\u00e9 avoir fait, \u00e9tait capable de former l\u2019intention de commettre un meurtre, m\u00eame si elle avait bu 25 verres de bi\u00e8re ou plus. A mon avis, l\u2019opinion ainsi sollicit\u00e9e par la poursuite se rapprochait \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00eame de la preuve du fait m\u00eame sur lequel le jury avait \u00e0 se prononcer si la d\u00e9fense d\u2019ivresse devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e et le pr\u00e9venu condamn\u00e9. En se disant d\u2019accord sur l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 en preuve du t\u00e9moignage du psychiatre, le Juge d\u2019appel Aylesworth a conclu, \u00e0 la page 21:\n[TRADUCTION] La relation entre les actes et la conduite de l\u2019appelant et sa capacit\u00e9 intellectuelle, que l\u2019on demandait au m\u00e9decin d\u2019\u00e9tablir, est s\u00fbrement une question au sujet de laquelle le t\u00e9moin pouvait avoir recours \u00e0 ses connaissances sp\u00e9ciales dans ce domaine. Le fait que le t\u00e9moin n\u2019avait pas examin\u00e9 l\u2019appelant ne peut, \u00e0 mon avis, avoir aucune influence sur la recevabilit\u00e9 de son t\u00e9moignage; le seul fondement de son t\u00e9moignage c\u2019est comme on l\u2019a d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, que les actes de l\u2019appelant peuvent avoir l\u2019effet de d\u00e9montrer, aux yeux d\u2019un expert dans le domaine de la psychiatrie, la pr\u00e9sence ou l\u2019absence d\u2019un degr\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 de capacit\u00e9 intellectuelle. Quoique l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de cette preuve doive \u00eatre laiss\u00e9e au jury, elle est \u00e0 mon avis recevable.\n(Les italiques sont de moi.)\nC\u2019est une preuve \u00e9manant d\u2019un sp\u00e9cialiste dans le domaine de la psychiatrie, relativement \u00e0 l\u2019absence d\u2019un degr\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 de capacit\u00e9 de comportement, qu\u2019on a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Je suis d\u2019avis que les paroles du Juge Aylesworth s\u2019appliquent et que \u00abquoique l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de cette preuve doive \u00eatre laiss\u00e9e au jury, elle est\u2026 recevable\u00bb.\nJe suis loin de poser comme r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que la preuve psychiatrique des pr\u00e9dispositions d\u2019une personne \u00e0 ne pas commettre le genre de crime dont il est accus\u00e9 doit \u00eatre admise, mais dans cette affaire-ci il s\u2019agit de grossi\u00e8re ind\u00e9cence entre deux hommes et je pense que les crimes relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019homosexualit\u00e9 sont dans une cat\u00e9gorie \u00e0 part, en ce sens que leurs auteurs poss\u00e8dent souvent des caract\u00e9ristiques qui les rendent collectivement plus facilement identifiables que les criminels ordinaires. Voir Regina v. Thompson[10]. De toute fa\u00e7on, il me para\u00eet qu\u2019un psychiatre est qualifi\u00e9 pour exprimer un avis sur la question de savoir si un homme est pr\u00e9dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019homosexualit\u00e9, ou autrement sexuellement perverti. Si un tel avis est pertinent, il doit \u00eatre recevable dans un proc\u00e8s comme celui-ci, m\u00eame s\u2019il am\u00e8ne le psychiatre \u00e0 exprimer l\u2019avis que l\u2019inculp\u00e9 ne poss\u00e8de pas la capacit\u00e9 de commettre le crime dont il est accus\u00e9.\nPour tous ces motifs, aussi bien que pour ceux exprim\u00e9s par le Juge Bull au nom de la majorit\u00e9 en Cour d\u2019appel, je rejetterais ce pourvoi.\nLE JUGE HALL\u2014Mes coll\u00e8gues, les Juges Martland et Ritchie ont expos\u00e9 dans leurs motifs les faits relatifs au pr\u00e9sent pourvoi.\nJe suis d\u2019accord avec mon coll\u00e8gue Ritchie pour dire que le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance aurait d\u00fb admettre toute la preuve que le Dr Newman, psychiatre, voulait pr\u00e9senter.\nL\u2019homosexualit\u00e9 n\u2019est ni un trouble psychique, ni une maladie mentale, ni un \u00e9tat r\u00e9sultant de la d\u00e9bilit\u00e9 ou d\u2019une infirmit\u00e9 mentale. C\u2019est un attrait et une affection sexuels entre personnes du m\u00eame sexe. Il y a diff\u00e9rents degr\u00e9s d\u2019homosexualit\u00e9, depuis ceux qui n\u2019ont jamais eu un penchant sexuel normal jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ceux qui ne sont homosexuels que dans des circonstances exceptionnelles, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire lorsqu\u2019ils sont totalement isol\u00e9s des personnes de l\u2019autre sexe. Chez ces derniers, l\u2019homosexualit\u00e9 dispara\u00eet ordinairement d\u00e8s qu\u2019ils reviennent \u00e0 un milieu normal. Entre ces extr\u00eames, d\u2019autres ont des tendances homosexuelles et h\u00e9t\u00e9rosexuelles, on dit d\u2019eux qu\u2019ils sont \u00abbisexuels\u00bb. Dans quelque cat\u00e9gorie que se trouve l\u2019homosexuel, son \u00e9tat est une d\u00e9viation acquise de son \u00e9tat normal. Personne n\u2019est pr\u00e9destin\u00e9 \u00e0 sa naissance \u00e0 devenir homosexuel, tout comme personne ne l\u2019est \u00e0 devenir alcoolique ou narco- mane. L\u2019h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9 ne joue aucun r\u00f4le dans cette \u00e9volution; le milieu est, dit-on, le facteur d\u00e9cisif.\nLes ouvrages sur l\u2019homosexualit\u00e9 ne s\u2019accordent pas sur les causes sp\u00e9cifiques de cet \u00e9tat. Cependant tous les \u2018auteurs conviennent que, quelles que soient les autres causes, les facteurs psychologiques jouent un tr\u00e8s grand r\u00f4le et qu\u2019il faut en tenir compte dans ce qu\u2019on peut appeler une explication \u00e0 complexit\u00e9 croissante. La psychiatrie s\u2019est int\u00e9ress\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude de l\u2019homosexualit\u00e9 et\n[TRADUCTION] \u00ab\u2026dans toute la psychiatrie, on trouve que la structure de la personnalit\u00e9 r\u00e9sulte d\u2019une interaction du milieu et des dispositions naturelles, \u00e0 un point tel qu\u2019il est presque possible d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019\u00e9quation suivante: la constitution multipli\u00e9e par le milieu \u00e9gale une constante.\u00bb (They Stand Apart, Windmill Press, Londres, 1955, p. 78.)\nIl s\u2019ensuit donc que les t\u00e9moignages de psychiatres sont particuli\u00e8rement appropri\u00e9s dans des affaires o\u00f9 il est question d\u2019homosexualit\u00e9. C\u2019est sa pertinence \u00e0 l\u2019objet du proc\u00e8s qui doit d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert fourni par des psychiatres. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a admis toute la preuve que pr\u00e9sentait le Dr Newman \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019opinion qu\u2019il voulait exprimer \u00e0 l\u2019effet que le caract\u00e8re normal de Lupien et ses m\u00e9canismes de d\u00e9fense \u00e9taient tels qu\u2019il aurait repouss\u00e9 toute avance homosexuelle et ne s\u2019y serait pas pr\u00eat\u00e9 consciemment. On a permis au Dr Newman de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une question hypoth\u00e9tique, pos\u00e9e en supposant que la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au proc\u00e8s \u00e9tait v\u00e9ridique, mais il n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u l\u2019autorisation d\u2019exprimer l\u2019opinion relat\u00e9e ci-dessus en s\u2019appuyant sur les tests qu\u2019il avait faits et fait faire ainsi que sur ses entretiens avec Lupien.\nLa question est de savoir o\u00f9 l\u2019on doit fixer la limite entre l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 et l\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9. Si la preuve \u00e9tait pertinente \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense qu\u2019on voulait pr\u00e9senter pour le compte de Lupien, et je suis d\u2019avis que tel \u00e9tait le cas, elle \u00e9tait alors admissible et le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a fait une erreur en la refusant.\nIl est vrai, comme le fait remarquer le Juge en chef de la Colombie-Britannique dans ses motifs de dissidence, que la r\u00e9ponse qu\u2019on atten- dait du psychiatre [TRADUCTION] \u00abvient trop pr\u00e8s de la conclusion m\u00eame que le jury doit tirer de la preuve\u00bb. Je ne crois pas pourtant que ce soit l\u00e0 un motif valable de refuser cette preuve. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, on ne peut pas la consid\u00e9rer comme une innovation en mati\u00e8re de preuve m\u00e9dicale. Les psychiatres sont admis \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s leur examen et leur observation d\u2019un inculp\u00e9, parfois longtemps apr\u00e8s le fait, ainsi que d\u2019apr\u00e8s leurs entretiens avec lui et les faits en preuve, cet inculp\u00e9 \u00e9tait incapable de former l\u2019intention n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la perp\u00e9tration du crime dont on l\u2019accuse. Ce genre de t\u00e9moignage est tr\u00e8s voisin, si vraiment il en reste distinct, de la conclusion m\u00eame que le jury doit tirer dans une telle affaire, pour conclure que le pr\u00e9venu est innocent parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019intention qui justifierait une d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9. Il appartient au jury seul de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019importance \u00e0 donner \u00e0 l\u2019opinion d\u2019un expert. Le r\u00f4le du juge de premi\u00e8re instance est de dire aux membres du jury qu\u2019il leur incombe, et \u00e0 eux seulement, d\u2019appr\u00e9cier la preuve.\nLa question \u00e0 laquelle il faut maintenant r\u00e9pondre est de savoir si l\u2019erreur dans ce cas-ci invalide la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 ou s\u2019il faut appliquer les dispositions de l\u2019art. 592(1)(b)(iii), qui se lisent ainsi:\n592. (1) Lors de l\u2019audition d\u2019un appel port\u00e9 contre une condamnation, la Cour d\u2019appel\n(b) peut rejeter l\u2019appel, si\u2026\n(iii) bien que la Cour estime que, pour tout motif mentionn\u00e9 au sous-alin\u00e9a (ii) de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (a), l\u2019appel pourrait \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en faveur de l\u2019appelant, elle est d\u2019avis qu\u2019aucun tort important ou aucune erreur judiciaire grave ne s\u2019est produite\u2026\nLe Juge Cartwright (maintenant Juge en chef du Canada) expose de la fa\u00e7on suivante dans ses motifs en l\u2019affaire Colpitts c. La Reine[11] les conditions n\u00e9cessaires pour l\u2019application de cette disposition:\n[TRADUCTION] Mon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Spence cite dans ses motifs un certain nombre de pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents qui devraient guider la Cour d\u2019appel dans son jugement, une fois l\u2019erreur d\u2019instruction d\u00e9montr\u00e9e, sur la question de savoir si l\u2019on peut affirmer sans crainte qu\u2019il ne s\u2019est produit aucun tort important ni aucune erreur judiciaire grave. A la lecture de ces pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, il faut observer qu\u2019une fois que l\u2019on a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il y a eu erreur de droit au proc\u00e8s, il incombe \u00e0 la poursuite d\u2019\u00e9tablir \u00e0 la satisfaction de la Cour que le verdict aurait n\u00e9cessairement \u00e9t\u00e9 le m\u00eame si cette erreur ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas produite. Cette preuve est une condition pr\u00e9alable de toute application des dispositions de ce sous-alin\u00e9a par la Cour d\u2019appel. La Cour n\u2019est pas tenue de l\u2019appliquer du seul fait que cette obligation se trouve satisfaite.\nL\u2019article reconna\u00eet l\u2019existence de cas o\u00f9, bien qu\u2019il y ait eu erreur de la part du Juge de premi\u00e8re instance, la Cour l\u2019appel peut, \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion, si le poids de la preuve l\u2019incite \u00e0 le faire, juger qu\u2019il n\u2019y a eu aucun tort important ni erreur judiciaire grave. Il s\u2019agit ici de l\u2019un de ces cas. La preuve \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du pr\u00e9venu \u00e9tait accablante et, selon moi, le verdict aurait n\u00e9cessairement \u00e9t\u00e9 le m\u00eame, m\u00eame si le jury avait entendu l\u2019opinion que le Dr Newman voulait pr\u00e9senter.\nJe suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il s\u2019agit ici d\u2019une affaire o\u00f9 les dispositions de l\u2019art. 592(1)(b)(iii) doivent s\u2019appliquer. En cons\u00e9quence, je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir l\u2019appel et de r\u00e9tablir la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 et la sentence.\nAppel accueilli et d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9tablie, LES JUGES RITCHIE et SPENCE \u00e9tant dissidents.\nProcureur de l\u2019appellant: G.L.

II n\u2019y a pas de r\u00e9serve dans les Territoires du Nord-Ouest.

Le texte de l\u2019article rend l\u2019intim\u00e9 coupable d\u2019une infraction en raison d\u2019une fa\u00e7on d\u2019agir qui ne donnerait lieu \u00e0 aucune sanction pour tout autre qu\u2019un Indien.

Il y a une distinction \u00e0 faire entre une d\u00e9\u00adclaration des tribunaux \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019un article ou une partie d\u2019un article d\u2019une loi est inop\u00e9rant et l\u2019abroga\u00adtion d\u2019un tel article, et il faut restreindre la d\u00e9clara\u00adtion aux circonstances de l\u2019affaire o\u00f9 elle est faite. Le mot \u00abloi\u00bb dans l\u2019art. 1(b) de la D\u00e9claration cana\u00addienne des droits doit s\u2019interpr\u00e9ter comme signifiant une \u00abloi du Canada\u00bb. Une personne est priv\u00e9e de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 devant la loi, si pour elle, \u00e0 cause de sa race, un acte qui, pour ses concitoyens canadiens, n\u2019est pas une infraction et n\u2019appelle aucune sanction devient une infraction punissable en justice. L\u2019article 94(b) de la Loi sur les Indiens, qui est une loi du Canada, cr\u00e9e une telle infraction et en l\u2019interpr\u00e9tant, on ne peut que conclure que son application supprime, restreint ou enfreint l\u2019un des droits d\u00e9clar\u00e9s et reconnus dans la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits. L\u2019article est donc inop\u00e9rant.\nLe fait qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas de r\u00e9serve dans les Terri\u00adtoires n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec la question.\nLe Juge Hall : Le concept selon lequel la D\u00e9clara\u00adtion canadienne des droits ne prend effet vis-\u00e0-vis d\u2019une loi du Canada que lorsque cette loi n\u2019accorde pas l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les personnes de la classe vis\u00e9e ou touch\u00e9e par cette loi particuli\u00e8re, doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9. La D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits n\u2019a de valeur et n\u2019a de sens que lorsque, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019unique exception \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art. 2, elle r\u00e9pudie dans chaque loi du Canada la discrimination en raison de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale, de la couleur, de la religion ou du sexe \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des droits de l\u2019homme et des libert\u00e9s fondamentales \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1, de quelque fa\u00e7on que cette discrimination puisse se manifester, non seulement entre Indiens et Indiens, mais entre tous les Canadiens qu\u2019ils soient Indiens ou non-Indiens.\nLe Juge en Chef Cartwright, dissident : L\u2019article 94(b) de la Loi sur les Indiens n\u2019est pas rendu inop\u00e9rant par la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits. L\u2019article est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 en termes clairs et non \u00e9quivoques, et on doit l\u2019appliquer suivant son sens clair. Le Parlement n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019intention de conf\u00e9rer aux tribunaux le pouvoir et de leur imposer la respon\u00adsabilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9clarer inop\u00e9rante toute disposition d\u2019une loi du Canada si le tribunal est d\u2019avis qu\u2019elle enfreint l\u2019un des droits ou libert\u00e9s \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1 de la D\u00e9claration, quoique cette disposition soit exprim\u00e9e en termes clairs et non \u00e9quivoques et que le sens, apr\u00e8s avoir fait appel \u00e0 toutes les r\u00e8gles d\u2019interpr\u00e9ta\u00adtion y compris celle de l\u2019art. 2 de la D\u00e9claration, demeure parfaitement clair. La D\u00e9claration cana\u00addienne des droits enjoint aux tribunaux d\u2019appliquer les lois du Canada et non de refuser de les appliquer.\nLe Juge Abbott, dissident : Il faudrait que les termes employ\u00e9s soient des plus clairs pour pr\u00eater au Parlement l\u2019intention que les tribunaux l\u00e9gif\u00e8rent par le processus judiciaire, ainsi que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits qu\u2019ont adopt\u00e9e les tribunaux des Territoires implique n\u00e9cessairement. L\u2019article 2 de la D\u00e9claration cana\u00addienne des droits n\u2019exprime pas cette intention. Au contraire, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la l\u00e9gislation ant\u00e9rieure l\u2019ar\u00adticle ne donne qu\u2019une simple r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation.\nLe Juge Pigeon, dissident : A l\u2019\u00e9gard de la l\u00e9gisla\u00adtion f\u00e9d\u00e9rale existante, l\u2019art. 2 de la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits \u00e9dicte une r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9ta\u00adtion et n\u2019impose pas aux tribunaux la t\u00e2che de retrancher de cette l\u00e9gislation, chaque fois que la question est soulev\u00e9e, toute disposition qui peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e en conflit avec les droits et libert\u00e9s \u00e9nu\u00adm\u00e9r\u00e9s. L\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 devant la loi, au sens que lui ont donn\u00e9 les Cours des Territoires, exigerait que dans chaque province les Indiens soient soumis aux m\u00eames r\u00e8gles juridiques que les autres, sous tout rapport et non seulement en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nSi l\u2019un des effets de la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits est de rendre inop\u00e9rantes toutes les disposi\u00adtions en vertu desquelles les Indiens en tant que tels ne sont pas trait\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que le grand public, on doit in\u00e9vitablement conclure que le Parlement, en \u00e9dictant la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits, n\u2019a pas seulement modifi\u00e9 fondamentalement le statut des Indiens par ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9 indirect, mais aussi qu\u2019il a assujetti l\u2019exercice futur de l\u2019auto\u00adrit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur les Indiens \u00e0 l\u2019exigence d\u2019une d\u00e9claration expresse \u00abque la loi s\u2019appliquera nonobstant la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits\u00bb. Il est difficile de croire que le Parlement avait cette intention lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9dict\u00e9 la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits. Pris \u00e0 la lettre, les mots \u00e0 l\u2019art. 2 \u00abdoit s\u2019interpr\u00e9ter et s\u2019appliquer de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ne pas supprimer, restreindre ou enfreindre\u00bb n\u2019\u00e9dictent pas plus qu\u2019une r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation.\nEn d\u00e9finitive, on ne peut rien trouver dans la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits qui d\u00e9montre clairement que le Parlement avait l\u2019intention d\u2019\u00e9ta\u00adblir \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des droits de l\u2019homme et des libert\u00e9s fondamentales des principes primordiaux d\u2019ordre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, que les tribunaux devraient appliquer \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la volont\u00e9 clairement exprim\u00e9e du Parlement dans les lois existant \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque. Le Parlement n\u2019a fait rien de plus que de prescrire aux tribunaux d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter et d\u2019appliquer ces lois conform\u00e9ment aux principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la D\u00e9cla\u00adration canadienne des droits, en consid\u00e9rant que les droits et libert\u00e9s reconnus existaient alors et non pas qu\u2019ils seraient \u00e9tablis par les tribunaux.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel des Territoires du Nord-Ouest[1], confirmant un jugement acquittant l\u2019intim\u00e9 de l\u2019inculpation d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 ivre hors d\u2019une r\u00e9serve.

Brian Purdy, pour l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nLE JUGE EN CHEF (dissident)\u2011Les faits per\u00adtinents, qui ne sont pas contest\u00e9s, et la marche des proc\u00e9dures dans les cours des Territoires sont relat\u00e9s dans les motifs de mes coll\u00e8gues les Juges Ritchie et Pigeon, que j\u2019ai eu le privil\u00e8ge de lire.\nEn fait l\u2019intim\u00e9 est indubitablement coupable d\u2019avoir enfreint l\u2019art. 94 (b) de la Loi sur les Indiens. Il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9cider si cette disposition est rendue inop\u00e9rante par la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits, Statuts du Canada 8-9 \u00c9liz. II, c. 44, que j\u2019appellerai ci-apr\u00e8s la D\u00e9claration.\nEn abordant cette question, je vais pr\u00e9sumer que l\u2019art. 94 (b) enfreint r\u00e9ellement le droit de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 devant la loi, tel qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a (b) de l\u2019art. 1 de la D\u00e9claration, du fait que, parce qu\u2019il est un Indien, ce texte le rend coupable d\u2019une infraction en raison d\u2019une fa\u00e7on d\u2019agir qui ne donnerait lieu \u00e0 aucune sanction pour tout autre qu\u2019un Indien.\nC\u2019est, je crois, la premi\u00e8re fois que cette Cour est appel\u00e9e \u00e0 trancher cette question. Dans Robertson et Rosetanni c. La Reine[2], la majorit\u00e9 a jug\u00e9 que les dispositions contest\u00e9es de la Loi sur le dimanche n\u2019enfreignaient pas le droit \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 de religion \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a (c) de l\u2019art. 1. de la D\u00e9claration, elle n\u2019a donc pas statu\u00e9 sur l\u2019opinion que j\u2019ai exprim\u00e9e dans mes motifs de dissidence quant \u00e0 l\u2019effet de la D\u00e9claration sur une disposition d\u2019une loi du Parlement qui en\u00adfreint l\u2019un des droits \u00e9nonc\u00e9s.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause, l\u2019art. 94(b) de la Loi sur les Indiens est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 en termes clairs et non \u00e9quivoques. Aucune r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation ne permet de lui donner un sens autre que celui-ci, savoir : un Indien qui est ivre hors d\u2019une r\u00e9serve est coupable d\u2019une infraction.\nDans les circonstances, le seul choix que nous ayons est soit d\u2019appliquer l\u2019article suivant son sens clair, soit de le d\u00e9clarer inop\u00e9rant, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, de d\u00e9clarer que la Loi sur les Indiens est, pro tanto, abrog\u00e9e par la D\u00e9claration.\nDans Robertson et Rosetanni c. La Reine (d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9e) j\u2019avais \u00e0 examiner une question semblable, vu qu\u2019\u00e0 mon avis la Loi sur le dimanche en\u00adfreignait la libert\u00e9 de religion. Je me suis exprim\u00e9 comme suit, aux pages 661 et 662 :\n[TRADUCTION] Il reste \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer les motifs de jugement du Juge d\u2019appel Davey dans Regina v. Gonzales (1962) 37 C.R. 56, 37 W.W.R. 257, 132 C.C.C. 237, 32 D.L.R. (2d) 290. A la page 239 des C.C.C. Reports, le savant Juge d\u2019appel dit :\n[TRADUCTION] Dans le cas o\u00f9 une loi existante ne va pas \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de ce que mentionnent express\u00e9ment les alin\u00e9as a) \u00e0 g) de l\u2019article 2, mais on pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019elle enfreint autrement certains des droits de l\u2019homme et des libert\u00e9s fondamen\u00adtales \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 1, j\u2019estime que l\u2019article ne l\u2019abroge ni express\u00e9ment ni implicitement. Au contraire, il reconna\u00eet express\u00e9ment le maintien en existence de cette loi tout en pr\u00e9voyant qu\u2019elle doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e et appliqu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ne pas porter atteinte \u00e0 ces droits et libert\u00e9s. Il semble ainsi simplement fournir une r\u00e8gle, un crit\u00e8re d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de cette loi. Le libell\u00e9 m\u00eame de l\u2019art. 2 \u00ab.... soit interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e et appliqu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ne pas abroger .. .\u00bb implique que la loi ant\u00e9\u00adrieure peut \u00eatre raisonnablement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e et appliqu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 \u00e9viter de porter atteinte aux droits et libert\u00e9s \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1. Si la loi ant\u00e9\u00adrieure ne peut \u00eatre ainsi interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e et appliqu\u00e9e, alors l\u2019art. 2 est sans effet et la loi ant\u00e9rieure doit l\u2019emporter conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 son sens clair.\nEn toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne puis accepter ce point de vue. A mon avis, les termes imp\u00e9ratifs de l\u2019article 2 de la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits, cit\u00e9 plus haut, exigent des tribunaux qu\u2019ils refusent d\u2019appli\u00adquer toute loi de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative du Parlement, qui enfreint la libert\u00e9 de religion, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019une loi du Parlement ne d\u00e9clare express\u00e9ment que la premi\u00e8re doit s\u2019appliquer nonobstant la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits. Comme on l\u2019a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, l\u2019art. 5(2) cit\u00e9 plus haut montre bien que la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits doit s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 toutes les lois du Canada existant au moment (Tb elle est entr\u00e9e en vigueur de m\u00eame qu\u2019\u00e0 celles qui sont promulgu\u00e9es par la suite. A mon sens, lorsqu\u2019il y a contradiction irr\u00e9ductible entre une autre loi du Parlement et la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits, cette derni\u00e8re doit pr\u00e9valoir.\nC\u2019est \u00e9videmment au Parlement qu\u2019il appartient de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019imposer, sous peine de sanctions p\u00e9nales, certaines normes de conduite reli\u00adgieuse \u00e0 toute la population. Mais en \u00e9dictant la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits, il a transmis aux tribunaux la responsabilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cider, chaque fois que la question se pose, si cela enfreint la libert\u00e9 de religion au Canada. Dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, j\u2019en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019art. 4 de la Loi sur le dimanche enfreint la libert\u00e9 de religion d\u00e9clar\u00e9e et garantie par la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il doit \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 inop\u00e9rant.\nApr\u00e8s avoir reconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 toute la question avec beaucoup de soin, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des arguments tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieux que nous ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s les avocats, j\u2019en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019opinion ex-prim\u00e9e par le Juge Davey, alors Juge d\u2019appel, dans les motifs cit\u00e9s ci-haut, est celle qu\u2019il faut retenir.\nLa question est la suivante : Est-ce l\u2019intention du Parlement de conf\u00e9rer aux tribunaux le pou-voir et de leur imposer la responsabilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9\u00adclarer inop\u00e9rante toute disposition d\u2019une loi du Canada si le tribunal est d\u2019avis qu\u2019elle enfreint l\u2019un des droits ou libert\u00e9s \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1 de la D\u00e9claration, quoique cette disposition soit ex-prim\u00e9e en termes clairs et non \u00e9quivoques et que le sens, apr\u00e8s avoir fait appel \u00e0 toutes les r\u00e8gles d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation y compris celle de l\u2019art. 2 de la D\u00e9claration, demeure parfaitement clair.\nEn abordant cette question, il ne faut pas oublier que la responsabilit\u00e9 ci-haut mentionn\u00e9e, si elle existe vraiment, est impos\u00e9e \u00e0 tous les Juges de paix, Magistrats, et Juges de n\u2019importe quel tribunal au pays appel\u00e9s \u00e0 appliquer une loi du Canada ou une ordonnance, une r\u00e8gle ou un r\u00e8glement \u00e9tablis en vertu d\u2019une telle loi.\nSi l\u2019on avait voulu que la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette ques\u00adtion soit affirmative, on aurait, \u00e0 mon avis, ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019art. 2 de la D\u00e9claration, quelque chose comme : \u00abet si une loi du Canada ne peut \u00eatre ainsi in\u00adterpr\u00e9t\u00e9e et appliqu\u00e9e, elle sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme inop\u00e9rante ou abrog\u00e9e, pro tanto\u00bb.\nJe crois que dans le passage pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 de mes motifs dans Robertson et Rosetanni c. La Reine mon erreur a \u00e9t\u00e9 de dire que la D\u00e9claration exige des tribunaux qu\u2019ils refusent d\u2019appliquer toute loi du Canada qui enfreint effectivement un des droits ou libert\u00e9s \u00e9nonc\u00e9s alors qu\u2019au contraire, comme le Juge d\u2019appel Davey l\u2019a signal\u00e9, la D\u00e9claration enjoint aux tribunaux d\u2019appliquer une telle loi et non de refuser de l\u2019appliquer.\nPour ces motifs, je disposerais de ce pourvoi comme le propose mon coll\u00e8gue, le Juge Pigeon.\nLe jugement des Juges Fauteux, Martland, Judson, Ritchie et Spence a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par\nLE JUGE RITCHIE\u2011Le pourvoi, que cette Cour a autoris\u00e9, est \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel des Territoires du Nord-Ouest[3]. Cet arr\u00eat a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel de la Couronne \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un jugement du Juge W. G. Morrow, de la Cour territoriale des Territoires du Nord-Ouest acquittant Joseph Drybones, de l\u2019inculpation d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 ivre hors d\u2019une r\u00e9serve, ill\u00e9galement, en con\u00adtravention des dispositions de l\u2019art. 94(b) de la Loi sur les Indiens, S.R.C. 1952, c. 149. La d\u00e9cision du Juge Morrow faisait suite \u00e0 un appel par proc\u00e8s de novo du jugement du Magistrat Anderson-Thompson qui avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 coupable de cette infraction et l\u2019avait condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 payer $10 d\u2019amende et les frais ou, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut, \u00e0 trois jours de d\u00e9tention. L\u2019inculpation de Drybones tenait dans le texte suivant :\n[TRADUCTION] Le 8 avril 1967, ou vers cette date, \u00e0 Yellowknife, dans les Territoires du Nord-Ouest, \u00e9tant un Indien, il \u00e9tait ivre hors d\u2019une r\u00e9serve, ill\u00e9galement, en contravention des dispositions de l\u2019article 94(b) de la Loi sur les Indiens.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 est Indien et il \u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement ivre, le soir du 8 avril 1967, \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4tel Old Stope, \u00e0 Yellowknife, dans les Territoires du Nord-Ouest, o\u00f9 il n\u2019y a pas de \u00abr\u00e9serve\u00bb au sens que donne \u00e0 ce mot la Loi sur les Indiens.\nTraduit devant le Magistrat Anderson-Thomp\u00adson, Drybones, qui ne parlait pas l\u2019anglais, s\u2019avoua coupable de l\u2019infraction pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e. Lors de l\u2019appel, en Cour territoriale, le Juge Morrow doutant beaucoup que Drybones ait bien com\u00adpris le sens de son plaidoyer devant le Magistrat, lui permit de le r\u00e9tracter et l\u2019appel se poursuivit comme proc\u00e8s de novo, sur plaidoyer de non-culpabilit\u00e9. L\u2019article 94 de la Loi sur les Indiens se lit comme suit :\n94. Un Indien qui\n(a) a des spiritueux en sa possession;\n(b) est ivre; ou\n(c) fait ou fabrique des spiritueux hors d\u2019une r\u00e9serve, est coupable d\u2019une infraction et passible, sur d\u00e9claration sommaire de culpabilit\u00e9, d\u2019une amende d\u2019au moins dix dollars et d\u2019au plus cinquante dollars ou d\u2019un emprisonnement n\u2019exc\u00e9dant pas trois mois, ou de l\u2019amende et de l\u2019emprisonnement \u00e0 la fois.\nJe conviens avec la Cour d\u2019appel que les mots \u00abhors d\u2019une r\u00e9serve\u00bb constituent\n[TRADUCTION] ... un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel qui doit \u00eatre prouv\u00e9 clans toute accusation port\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 94. Cependant, une fois qu\u2019il est prouv\u00e9, comme dans l\u2019affaire qui nous int\u00e9resse, que l\u2019infrac\u00adtion n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 commise sur une r\u00e9serve, l\u2019exigence de l\u2019article est satisfaite. Le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas de r\u00e9serve dans les Territoires n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec la question.\nLa question importante dans le pr\u00e9sent appel tient \u00e0 ce que dans les Territoires du Nord-Ouest le fait d\u2019\u00eatre ivre, ailleurs que dans un lieu public, ne constitue une infraction pour personne autre qu\u2019un Indien. L\u2019ordonnance intitul\u00e9e The Liquor Ordinance, (R.O.N.W.T.) 1957, c. 60, art. 19 (1) qui y est d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, \u00e9dicte que :\n[TRADUCTION] Nul ne doit se trouver en \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans un lieu public \u2026 mais \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence de l\u2019art. 94 de la Loi sur les Indiens elle ne prescrit pas une amende minimum et la peine maximum d\u2019emprisonnement y est de 30 jours alors qu\u2019elle est de 3 mois en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens.\nIl s\u2019ensuit donc qu\u2019un Indien qui est ivre chez lui, mais hors d\u2019une r\u00e9serve, est coupable d\u2019une infraction et passible d\u2019une amende d\u2019au moins $10 ou d\u2019un emprisonnement n\u2019exc\u00e9dant pas 3 mois ou des deux peines \u00e0 la fois, alors que n\u2019importe quel autre citoyen des Territoires peut, \u00e0 sa guise, s\u2019enivrer ailleurs que dans un lieu public, sans commettre une infraction. Et m\u00eame si cet autre citoyen est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable de se trouver en \u00e9tat d\u2019ivresse dans un lieu public, la seule peine que pr\u00e9voit l\u2019ordonnance est : [TRADUCTION] \u00abune amende d\u2019au plus $50. ou ... un emprisonnement n\u2019exc\u00e9dant pas 30 jours ou ...les deux peines \u00e0 la fois.\u00bb\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir avec succ\u00e8s devant le Juge Morrow et la Cour d\u2019appel qu\u2019en raison de cette loi, les Indiens des Territoires du Nord-Ouest sont, \u00e0 cause de leur race, priv\u00e9s de \u00abl\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 devant la loi\u00bb dont jouissent les autres Canadiens et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence l\u2019art. 94(b) de la Loi sur les Indiens autorise la suppression, la diminution ou la transgression de l\u2019un des droits de l\u2019homme et libert\u00e9s fondamentales reconnus et d\u00e9clar\u00e9s comme existant au Canada pour tout individu, quelle que soit sa race, par les dispositions de la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits, Statuts du Canada, 8-9 Eliz.

(2) L\u2019expression \u00abloi du Canada\u00bb \u00e0 la Partie I, d\u00e9signe une loi du Parlement du Canada, \u00e9dict\u00e9e avant ou apr\u00e8s la mise en vigueur de la pr\u00e9sente loi, ou toute ordonnance, r\u00e8gle ou r\u00e8glement \u00e9tabli sous son r\u00e9gime, et toute loi ex\u00e9cutoire au Canada ou dans une partie du Canada lors de l\u2019entr\u00e9e en application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, qui est susceptible d\u2019abrogation, d\u2019abolition ou de modifica\u00adtion par le Parlement du Canada.\nLa Cour d\u2019appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019accord avec le Juge Morrow que l\u2019art. 94(b) de la Loi sur les Indiens est inop\u00e9rant par suite de l\u2019adoption de la D\u00e9claration des droits. Aussi, l\u2019avis d\u2019appel \u00e0 cette Cour se limite-t-il au seul motif suivant :\n[TRADUCTION] Que la Cour d\u2019appel des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, en confirmant la d\u00e9cision de la Cour territoriale des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, a fait erreur en acquittant l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019une infraction \u00e0 l\u2019ar\u00adticle 94(b) de la Loi sur les Indiens, S.R.C. 1952, ch. 149, pour le motif que l\u2019art. 94 de la Loi sur les Indiens est rendu inop\u00e9rant en raison de la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits, S.C. 1960, ch. 44 .\nOn a pr\u00e9tendu au nom de l\u2019appelante que d\u2019apr\u00e8s le raisonnement et la conclusion des cours des Territoires la D\u00e9claration des droits rendrait l\u2019art. 94 inop\u00e9rant pour autant que les l\u00e9gisla\u00adtions provinciales ou territoriales feraient une infraction de l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9 ailleurs que dans un lieu public; que l\u2019application de cet article varierait donc non seulement d\u2019un endroit \u00e0 l\u2019autre au Canada, mais aussi d\u2019une \u00e9poque \u00e0 l\u2019autre, suivant les modifications que le provinces ou territoires pourraient apporter \u00e0 leurs lois. Je ne vois pas comment ce raisonnement s\u2019appli\u00adquerait \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire. L\u2019ordonnance dont il est question est une loi du Canada au sens o\u00f9 l\u2019entend l\u2019art. 5(2) de la D\u00e9claration des droits (voir la Loi sur les Territoires du Nord-Ouest, S.R.C. 1952, c. 195, art. 17), et c\u2019est une loi d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale dans les Territoires, tandis que la Loi sur les Indiens, bien qu\u2019\u00e9tant aussi une loi du Canada s\u2019applique aux Indiens seulement. La Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique a d\u00e9j\u00e0 examin\u00e9, dans l\u2019affaire Regina v. Gonzales[4], la question de savoir si la D\u00e9claration des droits rend inop\u00e9rant l\u2019art. 94 de la Loi sur les Indiens du fait qu\u2019il supprime, restreint ou en\u00adfreint le droit des Canadiens de race indienne \u00e0 l\u2019\u00ab\u00e9galit\u00e9 devant la loi\u00bb. Dans cette affaire-l\u00e0, le Juge d\u2019appel Tysoe a conclu de la fa\u00e7on suivante, au nom de la majorit\u00e9 :\n[TRADUCTION] L\u2019art. 94(a) de la Loi sur les Indiens ne supprime ni n\u2019enfreint le droit de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00ab\u00e9galit\u00e9 devant la loi\u00bb comme je l\u2019entends. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019art. 2 de la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits ne l\u2019infirme pas.\nTout en arrivant \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion, le Juge Davey, alors Juge d\u2019appel, qui a donn\u00e9 des motifs diff\u00e9rents de ceux de ses deux coll\u00e8gues, consid\u00e9ra qu\u2019il ne faut voir dans l\u2019art. 1 de la D\u00e9\u00adclaration des droits qu\u2019une r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois en vigueur lors de l\u2019adoption de la D\u00e9\u00adclaration. Ce savant Juge a dit :\n[TRADUCTION] Dans le cas o\u00f9 une loi existante ne va pas \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de ce que mentionnent express\u00e9\u00adment les alin\u00e9as (a) \u00e0 (g) de l\u2019art. 2 mais on pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019elle enfreint autrement certains des droits de l\u2019homme et libert\u00e9s fondamentales \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1, j\u2019estime que l\u2019article ne l\u2019abroge ni express\u00e9\u00adment ni implicitement. Au contraire, il reconna\u00eet express\u00e9ment le maintien en existence de cette loi tout en pr\u00e9voyant qu\u2019elle doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e et appliqu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ne pas porter atteinte \u00e0 ces droits et libert\u00e9s. Il semble ainsi simplement fournir une r\u00e8gle, un crit\u00e8re d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de cette loi. Le libell\u00e9 m\u00eame de l\u2019art, 2 \u00ab.. . soit interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e et appliqu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ne pas abroger ...\u00bb implique que la loi ant\u00e9rieure peut \u00eatre raisonnablement inter\u00adpr\u00e9t\u00e9e et appliqu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 \u00e9viter de porter atteinte aux droits et libert\u00e9s \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1. Si la loi ant\u00e9rieure ne peut \u00eatre ainsi raisonnablement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e et appliqu\u00e9e, alors l\u2019art. 2 est sans effet et la loi ant\u00e9rieure doit l\u2019emporter conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 son sens clair.\nIl se peut que l\u2019application de cette r\u00e8gle d\u2019inter\u00adpr\u00e9tation aux lois existantes n\u00e9cessite un changement dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation judiciaire de certaines lois dont la r\u00e9daction le permet et qu\u2019elle modifie ainsi le droit. La difficult\u00e9 quant \u00e0 l\u2019art. 94(a) de la Loi sur les Indiens c\u2019est qu\u2019il ne permet aucune interpr\u00e9ta\u00adtion qui l\u2019emp\u00eache d\u2019aller \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019art. 1(b) de la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits comme l\u2019interpr\u00e8te l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant. La D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits n\u2019ayant pas pour effet d\u2019abroger une telle loi, il incombe aux tribunaux d\u2019appliquer l\u2019art. 94(a) de la seule fa\u00e7on possible d\u2019apr\u00e8s ses termes clairs, et c\u2019est ce qu\u2019a fait le savant Magistrat lorsqu\u2019il a prononc\u00e9 la condamnation.\nCette affirmation me para\u00eet saper la base m\u00eame de la D\u00e9claration des droits, m\u00e9conna\u00eetre son caract\u00e8re manifeste de d\u00e9claration statutaire des droits de l\u2019homme et des libert\u00e9s fondamentales qu\u2019elle reconna\u00eet, pour la r\u00e9duire \u00e0 n\u2019\u00eatre gu\u00e8re plus qu\u2019une r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois f\u00e9d\u00e9\u00adrales. Toutefois, comme cette mani\u00e8re de voir a re\u00e7u un accueil favorable aupr\u00e8s d\u2019\u00e9minents commentateurs, il me semble important de l\u2019exa\u00adminer en premier lieu.\nJe citerai plus loin l\u2019affaire Robertson et Rosetanni c. La Reine[5], ici je n\u2019en parlerai que pour dire qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019instar des tribunaux des Terri\u00adtoires, je partage l\u2019avis exprim\u00e9 par le Juge en chef actuel, dans ses motifs de dissidence, au sujet de l\u2019opinion pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e du Juge Davey. Voici ce qu\u2019il dit, \u00e0 la page 662 :\n[TRADUCTION] En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne puis accep\u00adter ce point de vue. A mon avis, les termes imp\u00e9\u00adratifs de l\u2019art. 2 de la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits, cit\u00e9 plus haut, exigent des tribunaux qu\u2019ils refusent d\u2019appliquer toute loi de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative du Parlement, qui enfreint la libert\u00e9 de religion, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019une loi du Parlement ne d\u00e9clare express\u00e9ment que la premi\u00e8re doit s\u2019appliquer nonobstant la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits. montre bien que la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits Comme on l\u2019a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, l\u2019art. 5(2) cit\u00e9 plus haut doit s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 toutes les lois du Canada existant au moment o\u00f9 elle est entr\u00e9e en vigueur de m\u00eame qu\u2019\u00e0 celles qui sont promulgu\u00e9es par la suite. A mon sens, lorsqu\u2019il y a contradiction irr\u00e9ductible entre une autre loi du Parlement et la D\u00e9claration cana\u00addienne des droits, cette derni\u00e8re doit pr\u00e9valoir.\nJe ne trouve pas que cette opinion contredise d\u00e9 quelque fa\u00e7on l\u2019avis de la majorit\u00e9 de cette Cour dans l\u2019affaire Robertson et Rosetanni c. La Reine (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e) \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019article contest\u00e9 de la Loi sur le dimanche ne vient pas en conflit avec la D\u00e9claration des droits.\nCependant, avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je suis d\u2019avis que, pour un autre motif, le raisonnement du Juge Davey est insoutenable. La cons\u00e9quence de ce raisonnement c\u2019est que toute loi du Canada qui ne peut \u00eatre \u00abraisonnablement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e et appliqu\u00e9e\u00bb sans enfreindre la D\u00e9claration de droits doit avoir effet nonobstant les dispositions de la D\u00e9claration. Je ne puis concilier cette interpr\u00e9\u00adtation avec le d\u00e9but de l\u2019art. 2 o\u00f9 il est d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 que :\nToute loi du Canada, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019une loi du Parlement du Canada ne d\u00e9clare express\u00e9ment qu\u2019elle s\u2019appliquera nonobstant la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits, doit s\u2019interpr\u00e9ter et s\u2019appliquer de ma\u00adni\u00e8re \u00e0 ne pas supprimer ...\n(Les italiques sont de moi.)\nSi le raisonnement du Juge Davey \u00e9tait juste et s\u2019il fallait interpr\u00e9ter la D\u00e9claration des droits comme signifiant que toutes les lois du Canada qui l\u2019enfreignent nettement doivent avoir effet nonobstant ses dispositions, les mots de l\u2019art. 2 que j\u2019ai soulign\u00e9s seraient inutiles, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019on ne suppose que le Parlement a voulu se r\u00e9server le droit de n\u2019exclure de l\u2019application de la D\u00e9cla\u00adration des droits que les lois dont le sens est obscur.\nIl me semble qu\u2019il faut donner \u00e0 ces mots un sens plus r\u00e9aliste; \u00e0 mon avis, ils indiquent tr\u00e8s clairement que l\u2019art. 2 veut dire, et signifie effec\u00adtivement que, si une loi du Canada ne peut \u00eatre \u00abraisonnablement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e et appliqu\u00e9e\u00bb sans supprimer, restreindre ou enfreindre un des droits ou libert\u00e9s reconnus et proclam\u00e9s dans la D\u00e9cla\u00adration, une telle loi est inop\u00e9rante \u00ab\u00e0 moins qu\u2019une loi du Parlement du Canada ne d\u00e9clare express\u00e9\u00adment qu\u2019elle s\u2019appliquera nonobstant la D\u00e9clara\u00adtion canadienne des droits\u00bb.\nJe crois qu\u2019il y a une distinction \u00e0 faire entre une d\u00e9claration des tribunaux \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019un ar\u00adticle ou une partie d\u2019un article d\u2019une loi est inop\u00e9rant et l\u2019abrogation d\u2019un tel article et qu\u2019il faut restreindre la d\u00e9claration aux circonstances de l\u2019affaire o\u00f9 elle est faite. La situation me para\u00eet analogue \u00e0 celle d\u2019une loi provinciale valide dans un champ autrement inoccup\u00e9 qui devient inop\u00e9rante par suite d\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en conflit.\nIl convient maintenant, je pense, d\u2019\u00e9tudier la th\u00e9orie avanc\u00e9e de la part de l\u2019appelante \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les droits et libert\u00e9s reconnus et d\u00e9clar\u00e9s dans la D\u00e9claration des droits doivent \u00eatre en relation avec les lois du Canada en vigueur le 10 ao\u00fbt 1960, date de la sanction de la D\u00e9claration et \u00eatre d\u00e9limit\u00e9s par ces lois, qui comprennent l\u2019art. 94 de la Loi sur les Indiens. Cette th\u00e9orie s\u2019appuie principalement sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a suivant des motifs de jugement de cette Cour dans l\u2019affaire Robertson et Rosetanni c. La Reine, (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e) :\n[TRADUCTION] Il faut remarquer tout d\u2019abord que la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits ne s\u2019int\u00e9resse pas aux \u00abdroits de l\u2019homme et aux libert\u00e9s fondamentales\u00bb dans un sens abstrait mais \u00e0 ces droits et libert\u00e9s qui existaient au Canada juste avant la promulgation de la loi (voir \u00e9galement l\u2019art. 5(1) ). C\u2019est donc la \u00ablibert\u00e9 de religion\u00bb alors existante dans ce pays qui est sauvegard\u00e9e par les dispositions de l\u2019art. 2 .. .\nLa question dans cette affaire-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait de savoir si la Loi sur le dimanche, en prescrivant que \u00abnu] ne peut l\u00e9galement le dimanche ... exercer ou poursuivre une besogne de son \u00e9tat ordi\u00adnaire ... \u00bb supprime, restreint ou enfreint le droit \u00e0 la \u00ablibert\u00e9 de religion\u00bb. On soutenait de la part de l\u2019appelante que, l\u2019expression \u00ablibert\u00e9 de reli\u00adgion\u00bb dans la D\u00e9claration des droits, signifie [TRADUCTION] \u00abla facult\u00e9 de jouir de la libert\u00e9 que m\u2019accorde ma propre religion, sans \u00eatre astreint aux restrictions qu\u2019impose le Parlement pour faire observer la doctrine d\u2019une foi \u00e0 laquelle je n\u2019ad\u00adh\u00e8re pas\u00bb. Pour examiner cette pr\u00e9tention, il a fallu \u00e9tudier les d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures et d\u00e9ter\u00adminer quelle \u00e9tait la d\u00e9finition reconnue de la \u00ablibert\u00e9 de religion\u00bb comme elle existait au Canada juste avant la promulgation de la D\u00e9claration des droits et c\u2019est dans ce sens, je crois, qu\u2019il faut lire l\u2019extrait des motifs de jugement que je viens de citer. L\u2019alin\u00e9a suivant de ces motifs me para\u00eet le confirmer. Il se lit comme suit :\n[TRADUCTION] Il est donc tr\u00e8s important de bien comprendre le concept de libert\u00e9 de religion qui \u00e9tait reconnu dans ce pays avant la promulgation de la D\u00e9claration des droits et apr\u00e8s la promulgation de la Loi sur le dimanche sous sa forme actuelle.\nSi l\u2019on avait admis que les lois du Canada en vigueur au moment de l\u2019adoption de la D\u00e9clara\u00adtion des droits d\u00e9limitent le droit \u00e0 la \u00ablibert\u00e9 de religion\u00bb y mentionn\u00e9, il n\u2019e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire, pour d\u00e9cider de la validit\u00e9 de la Loi sur le dimanche de se reporter aux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents pour y \u00e9tudier la situation \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019id\u00e9e que l\u2019on se faisait au Canada de la \u00ablibert\u00e9 de religion\u00bb au moment de l\u2019adoption de la D\u00e9claration des droits. Il e\u00fbt suffi de dire que l\u2019expression \u00ablibert\u00e9 de religion\u00bb au sens que lui donne la D\u00e9claration des droits signifie la libert\u00e9 de religion sous r\u00e9serve des dispositions de la Loi sur le dimanche. Cette interpr\u00e9tation aurait cependant \u00e9t\u00e9 contraire aux dispositions de l\u2019art. 5(2) de la D\u00e9claration, dispositions qui la rendent applicable \u00e0 toute \u00abloi du Parlement du Canada \u00e9dict\u00e9e avant ou apr\u00e8s la mise en vigueur de la pr\u00e9sente loi.\u00bb\nDe toute fa\u00e7on, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de sta\u00adtuer sur cette question dans l\u2019affaire Robertson et Rosetanni parce qu\u2019on a jug\u00e9 que la disposi\u00adtion contest\u00e9e de la Loi sur le dimanche n\u2019est pas en conflit avec la D\u00e9claration des droits. Aussi, je ne consid\u00e8re pas que cette d\u00e9cision-l\u00e0 permette de soutenir que la D\u00e9claration des droits doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme subordonn\u00e9e aux lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales en vigueur au moment de son adop\u00adtion. En particulier, je n\u2019estime pas que le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019art. 94(b) de la Loi sur les Indiens limite ou modifie de quelque fa\u00e7on les dispositions de l\u2019art. 1(b) de la D\u00e9claration des droits.\nLe droit dont il est question ici est celui \u00abde l\u2019individu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 devant la loi et \u00e0 la protec\u00adtion de la loi\u00bb. Le Juge Tysoe, qui a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 les motifs du jugement au nom de la majorit\u00e9 en Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique dans l\u2019affaire Gonzales (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e) exprime l\u2019opinion que ces termes, dans la D\u00e9claration des droits, veulent dire :\n[TRADUCTION] Le droit qu\u2019a toute personne touch\u00e9e ou vis\u00e9e par une loi particuli\u00e8re., quelle que soit sa race, son origine nationale, sa couleur, sa religion ou son sexe, d\u2019\u00eatre sur un pied d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 avec toute autre personne touch\u00e9e ou vis\u00e9e par une loi parti. culi\u00e8re, et le droit \u00e0 la protection de la loi.\n(Les italiques sont du Juge Tysoe dans le texte original) Tout comme les juges des Cours des Terri\u00adtoires, je ne puis admettre cette interpr\u00e9tation. Elle aurait pour cons\u00e9quence, il me semble, qu\u2019il faudrait consid\u00e9rer que la loi la plus manifestement discriminatoire envers un groupe ethnique reconna\u00eet \u00e0 chacun des membres de ce groupe \u00abl\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 devant la loi\u00bb si elle est \u00e9galement dis\u00adcriminatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de tous les autres membres du m\u00eame groupe.\nJe pense que le mot \u00abloi\u00bb dans l\u2019art. 1(b) de la D\u00e9claration des droits doit s\u2019interpr\u00e9ter comme signifiant une \u00abloi du Canada\u00bb au sens de la d\u00e9finition \u00e0 l\u2019art. 5(2) (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, une loi du Parlement du Canada, ou une ordonnance, une r\u00e8gle ou un r\u00e8glement \u00e9tablis sous son r\u00e9\u00adgime). Sans rechercher une d\u00e9finition compl\u00e8te de l\u2019expression \u00ab\u00e9galit\u00e9 devant la loi\u00bb, je pense que l\u2019art. 1(b) signifie au moins qu\u2019un individu ou un groupe d\u2019individus ne doit pas \u00eatre trait\u00e9 plus durement qu\u2019un autre en vertu de la loi. J\u2019en conclus donc qu\u2019une personne est priv\u00e9e de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 devant la loi, si pour elle, \u00e0 cause de sa race, un acte qui, pour ses concitoyens canadiens, n\u2019est pas une infraction et n\u2019appelle aucune sanc\u00adtion devient une infraction punissable en justice.\nPour d\u00e9cider la pr\u00e9sente affaire, il me suffit de dire qu\u2019\u00e0 mon avis l\u2019art. 94(b) de la Loi sur les Indiens, qui est une loi du Canada, cr\u00e9e une telle infraction et qu\u2019en l\u2019interpr\u00e9tant on ne peut que conclure que son application supprime, res\u00adtreint ou enfreint l\u2019un des droits d\u00e9clar\u00e9s et reconnus dans la D\u00e9claration des droits. Pour les motifs que je viens d\u2019indiquer, je suis donc d\u2019avis que l\u2019art. 94(b) est inop\u00e9rant.\nPour d\u00e9cider la question soulev\u00e9e par le pour\u00advoi, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019exprimer une opi\u00adnion sur l\u2019application d\u2019aucun autre article de la Loi sur les Indiens.\nPour les motifs ci-dessus, je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi.\nDepuis la r\u00e9daction de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, j\u2019ai eu le privil\u00e8ge de lire les motifs du Juge en chef et du Juge Pigeon. D\u2019apr\u00e8s ces motifs consid\u00e9\u00adr\u00e9s comme un tout, il faut \u00e0 mon sens conclure que, m\u00eame en pr\u00e9sumant que l\u2019application des dispositions d\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la D\u00e9claration des droits prive une cat\u00e9gorie de citoyens du droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 devant la loi \u00e0 cause de leur origine raciale et est ainsi discriminatoire \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard, il faut appliquer ces dispositions nonobstant celles de la D\u00e9claration des droits. Ces opinions de mes coll\u00e8gues m\u2019obligent \u00e0 r\u00e9af\u00adfirmer mon point de vue \u00e0 ce sujet.\nJe suis tout \u00e0 fait d\u2019accord avec le Juge en chef que le probl\u00e8me soulev\u00e9 ici n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9\u00adsolu dans l\u2019affaire Robertson et Rosetanni c. La Reine (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e) et que c\u2019est la premi\u00e8re fois que cette Cour se trouve oblig\u00e9e de le r\u00e9soudre.\nA mon avis, en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019art. 1 de la D\u00e9claration des droits \u00able droit de l\u2019in\u00addividu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 devant la loi\u00bb \u00abquelle que soit sa race\u00bb est reconnu comme un droit qui existe au Canada et les art. 2 et 5 de la D\u00e9claration d\u00e9\u00adcr\u00e8tent que toute loi du Canada \u00e9dict\u00e9e avant ou apr\u00e8s la mise en vigueur de la D\u00e9claration doit, \u00e0 moins que le Parlement ne d\u00e9clare express\u00e9ment le contraire, \u00abs\u2019interpr\u00e9ter et s\u2019appliquer de mani\u00e8\u00adre \u00e0 ne pas supprimer, restreindre ou enfreindre\u00bb l\u2019un quelconque des droits ainsi reconnus ni \u00e0 en \u00abautoriser la suppression, la diminution ou la transgression\u00bb.\nIl est bien possible que l\u2019application judiciaire de la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits donne lieu \u00e0 de grandes difficult\u00e9s mais, \u00e0 mon avis, il faut donner leur plein effet aux dispositions de l\u2019art. 2.\nL\u2019affaire pr\u00e9sentement devant nous d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il existe des lois du Canada qui suppriment, restreignent et enfreignent le droit d\u2019un Indien \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 devant la loi et, \u00e0 mon avis, afin d\u2019appli\u00adquer ces lois en se conformant aux termes expli\u00adcites employ\u00e9s par le Parlement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 2 de la D\u00e9claration des droits il faut d\u00e9clarer que l\u2019art. 94(b) de la Loi sur les Indiens est inop\u00e9rant.\nJe crois utile d\u2019affirmer clairement que ces motifs s\u2019appliquent seulement \u00e0 un cas o\u00f9, en vertu des lois du Canada, est r\u00e9put\u00e9 infraction punissable en droit, pour une personne, \u00e0 cause de sa race, un acte que ses concitoyens canadiens qui ne sont pas de cette race peuvent poser sans encourir aucune sanction. A mon avis, cela est bien loin d\u2019\u00eatre applicable \u00e0 toutes les disposi\u00adtions de la Loi sur les Indiens. LE JUGE ABBOTT (dissident)\u2011Les faits perti\u00adnents, qui ne sont pas contest\u00e9s, sont relat\u00e9s dans les motifs de mes coll\u00e8gues les Juges Ritchie et Pigeon, que j\u2019ai eu le privil\u00e8ge de lire.\nL\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la D\u00e9claration des droits qu\u2019ont adopt\u00e9e les tribunaux des Territoires im\u00adplique n\u00e9cessairement que le Parlementa d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 une partie importante de sa comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative aux tribunaux. Son pouvoir de le faire est incontestable mais, \u00e0 mon avis, il faudrait que les termes employ\u00e9s soient des plus clairs pour pr\u00eater au Parlement l\u2019intention d\u2019adresser aux tribunaux une telle invitation \u00e0 l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer par le processus judiciaire. Je ne trouve pas que l\u2019art. 2 de la D\u00e9claration des droits exprime cette intention. Au contraire, je partage l\u2019opinion exprim\u00e9e par le Juge en chef, par mon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Pigeon et par le Juge Davey, alors Juge d\u2019appel, dans l\u2019affaire Gonzales, \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la l\u00e9gislation ant\u00e9rieure l\u2019article ne donne qu\u2019une simple r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation.\nJe disposerais du pourvoi de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que mon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Pigeon.\nLE JUGE HALL-Je suis d\u2019accord avec les motifs de mon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Ritchie et vou\u00addrais seulement ajouter certaines observations concernant la d\u00e9cision dans Regina v. Gonzales[6].\nLe concept selon lequel la D\u00e9claration cana\u00addienne des droits ne prend effet vis-\u00e0-vis d\u2019une loi du Canada que lorsque cette loi n\u2019accorde pas l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les personnes de la classe vis\u00e9e ou touch\u00e9e par cette loi particuli\u00e8re, comme l\u2019a exprim\u00e9 le Juge Tysoe de la Cour d\u2019appel, \u00e0 la page 264 :\n[TRADUCTION] Venons-en maintenant \u00e0 l\u2019article 1(b) de la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits. Le sens du mot \u00ab\u00e9galit\u00e9\u00bb est bien connu. A mon avis, le mot \u00abdevant\u00bb dans l\u2019expression \u00ab\u00e9galit\u00e9 devant la loi\u00bb, au sens qui lui est donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 1(b), signifie \u00aben pr\u00e9sence de\u00bb. D\u2019apr\u00e8s moi, c\u2019est l\u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9ta\u00adtion correcte de l\u2019expression et il en ressort que \u00ab\u00e9galit\u00e9 devant la loi\u00bb n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec l\u2019applica\u00adtion de la loi \u00e9galement pour tous et de lois \u00e9gales pour tous comme le soutient l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire les m\u00eames lois pour tous, mais avec la situation des personnes vis\u00e9es ou touch\u00e9es par une loi. Elles ont le droit de se voir appliquer la loi telle qu\u2019elle existe, sur un plan d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, sans distinction de personnes,\nest analogue \u00e0 la position prise par la Cour Supr\u00eame des \u00c9tats-Unis dans Plessy v. Ferguson[7], qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e en totalit\u00e9 par la m\u00eame Cour dans son jugement historique sur la d\u00e9s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation, Brown v. Board of Educations[8].\nDans Plessy v. Ferguson la Cour a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019en vertu de la doctrine \u00abdistinct mais \u00e9gal\u00bb les diff\u00e9rentes races se voient accorder l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement lorqu\u2019on [sic] leur fournit des services sensiblement \u00e9gaux bien que distincts. Dans Brown v. Board of Education la Cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la doctrine \u00abdistinct mais \u00e9gal\u00bb \u00e9tait enti\u00e8\u00adrement erron\u00e9e.\nLes situations sociales consid\u00e9r\u00e9es dans Brown v. Board of Education et dans la pr\u00e9sente cause sont, bien entendu, tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes, mais le con\u00adcept philsophique [sic] fondamental est le m\u00eame. La D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits n\u2019atteint pas son but si pour l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 devant la loi elle ne fait qu\u2019\u00e9tablir un rapport d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre Indiens et Indiens; elle n\u2019a de valeur et n\u2019a de sens que lorsque, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019unique exception \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art. 2, elle r\u00e9pudie dans chaque loi du Canada la discrimination en raison de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale, de la couleur, de la religion ou du sexe \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des droits de l\u2019homme et des libert\u00e9s fondamentales \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1, de quelque fa\u00e7on que cette discrimination puisse se manifester, non seulement entre Indiens et In\u00addiens, mais entre tous les Canadiens qu\u2019ils soient Indiens ou non-Indiens.\nLE JUGE PIGEON (dissident)\u2011L\u2019intim\u00e9 est un Indien et l\u2019accusation suivante a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e contre lui devant un Magistrat des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, savoir que,\nLe 8 avril 1967, ou vers cette date, \u00e0 Yellowknife, dans les Territoires du Nord-Ouest, \u00e9tant un Indien, il \u00e9tait ivre hors d\u2019une r\u00e9serve, ill\u00e9galement, en contravention des dispositions de l\u2019article 94(b) de la Loi sur les Indiens.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 a plaid\u00e9 coupable et a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 une amende de $10 et aux frais. A l\u2019occasion de son appel \u00e0 la Cour Territoriale, on lui a permis de r\u00e9tracter son plaidoyer de culpabilit\u00e9. Ayant plaid\u00e9 non coupable, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soutenu que l\u2019art. 94(b) de la Loi sur les Indiens avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu inop\u00e9rant par la D\u00e9claration cana\u00addienne des droits (8-9 Eliz. II, c. 44, que j\u2019ap\u00adpellerai ci-apr\u00e8s la D\u00e9claration\u00bb). Cet argument a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueilli par le Juge Morrow et l\u2019accusation a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e.\nLa Couronne en a appel\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel des Territoires du Nord-Ouest[9]. Cette Cour a refus\u00e9 de suivre la d\u00e9cision contraire de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique dans Regina V. Gonzales[10] et elle a confirm\u00e9 l\u2019acquittement.\nLa Couronne en appelle maintenant \u00e0 notre Cour, en vertu d\u2019une permission sp\u00e9ciale.\nLa question dont nous sommes saisis est de savoir si, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale exis\u00adtante, l\u2019art. 2 de la D\u00e9claration \u00e9dicte une \u201cr\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation ou impose aux tribunaux la t\u00e2che de retrancher de cette l\u00e9gislation, chaque fois que la question est soulev\u00e9e, toute disposition qui peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e en conflit avec les droits et libert\u00e9s \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s; En \u00e9non\u00e7ant ainsi la question, je n\u2019oublie pas que, du fait de la d\u00e9finition de l\u2019expression \u00abloi du Canada\u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019art. 5(2), l\u2019art. 2 s\u2019applique aux lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales \u00e0 venir aussi bien qu\u2019\u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation existante. Toutefois, parce qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas impossible que d\u2019autres consid\u00e9rations entrent en jeu lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agira des lois \u00e0 venir, il me semble opportun de ne pas aller plus loin qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire pour en arriver \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision dans cette affaire, qui ne concerne que la l\u00e9gis\u00adlation existante.\nAvant d\u2019en consid\u00e9rer les dispositions, je dois noter que la D\u00e9claration comporte un pr\u00e9ambule, qui se lit comme suit :\nLe Parlement du Canada proclame que la nation canadienne repose sur des principes qui recon\u00adnaissent la supr\u00e9matie de Dieu, la dignit\u00e9 et la valeur de la personne humaine ainsi que le r\u00f4le de la famille dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019hommes libres et d\u2019institutions libres;\nIl proclame en outre que les hommes et les insti\u00adtutions ne demeurent libres que dans la mesure o\u00f9 la libert\u00e9 s\u2019inspire du respect des valeurs morales et spirituelles et du r\u00e8gne du droit; Et afin d\u2019expliciter ces principes ainsi que les droits de l\u2019homme et les libert\u00e9s fondamentales qui en d\u00e9coulent, dans une D\u00e9claration de droits qui respecte la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative du Parlement du Canada et qui assure \u00e0 sa population la protection de ces droits et de ces libert\u00e9s;\nEnsuite, apr\u00e8s la formule de promulgation et le titre \u00abPartie I\u2011D\u00e9claration des Droits\u00bb, l\u2019art. 1 est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans les termes suivants :\n1. Il est par les pr\u00e9sentes reconnu et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les droits de l\u2019homme et les libert\u00e9s fondamentales ci-apr\u00e8s \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ont exist\u00e9 et continueront \u00e0 exister pour tout individu au Canada quels que soient sa race, son origine nationale, sa couleur, sa religion ou son sexe :\n(a) le droit de l\u2019individu \u00e0 la vie, \u00e0 la libert\u00e9, \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la personne ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la jouissance de ses biens, et le droit de ne s\u2019en voir priv\u00e9 que par l\u2019application r\u00e9guli\u00e8re de la loi;\n(b) le droit de l\u2019individu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 devant la loi et \u00e0 la protection de la loi;\n(c) la libert\u00e9 de religion;\n(d) la libert\u00e9 de parole;\n(e) la libert\u00e9 de r\u00e9union et d\u2019association, et\n(f) la libert\u00e9 de la presse.\nEn consid\u00e9rant les dispositions que je viens de citer, il faut observer que la D\u00e9claration elle-m\u00eame d\u00e9bute par une d\u00e9claration solennelle du Parlement, sous forme de loi portant que, au Canada, les droits et libert\u00e9s \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00abont exist\u00e9 et con\u00adtinueront \u00e0 exister ... \u00bb. Cette d\u00e9claration est l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de la premi\u00e8re disposition de la D\u00e9claration et elle n\u2019est assortie d\u2019aucune r\u00e9serve. Elle est le point de d\u00e9part de cette loi et il n\u2019est pas facile de la concilier avec la pr\u00e9tention qu\u2019en fait ces droits et libert\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9taient pas enti\u00e8rement et compl\u00e8tement existants, mais \u00e9taient restreints par un nombre ind\u00e9termin\u00e9 de dispositions, sta\u00adtutaires et autres, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre.\nIl ne fait pas de doute que lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9dicte des lois le Parlement est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 au courant de l\u2019\u00e9tat du droit (Walker c. Le Roi[11]). A fortiori, doit-il en \u00eatre ainsi lorsque le texte m\u00eame de la loi y fait allusion. Comment peut-on d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e des droits de l\u2019homme et des libert\u00e9s fon\u00addamentales existants si ce n\u2019est en se reportant au texte des lois et autres actes l\u00e9gislatifs, ainsi qu\u2019aux d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux? Il faut aussi tenir compte du fait que les droits et libert\u00e9s \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 1 ne sont pas des concepts juridiques ayant un contenu pr\u00e9cis et invariable. S\u2019il fallait les consid\u00e9rer isol\u00e9ment, beaucoup resterait \u00e0 d\u00e9finir. Toutefois, en d\u00e9cla\u00adrant ces droits et libert\u00e9s comme ils existaient, on les a grandement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s. N\u2019est-ce pas l\u00e0 un but important de l\u2019article 1 et une fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s efficace de d\u00e9finir certains mots cl\u00e9s de la D\u00e9claration?\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause, la question de savoir si toute la l\u00e9gislation existante doit \u00eatre consi\u00add\u00e9r\u00e9e conforme au principe de non-discrimination ne peut manquer de venir imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 l\u2019esprit vu qu\u2019elle d\u00e9coule directement du chef 24 de l\u2019art. 91 de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord bri\u00adtannique, en vertu duquel le Parlement a l\u2019au\u00adtorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative exclusive sur \u00abLes Indiens et les terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour les Indiens\u00bb. Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 le Juge Riddell, dans Rex v. Martin[12], cette disposition conf\u00e8re l\u2019autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gis\u00adlative sur les Indiens en tant qu\u2019Indiens et non autrement. Son objet m\u00eame, en ce qui concerne les Indiens par opposition aux terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour les Indiens, est de permettre au Parlement du Canada d\u2019\u00e9dicter des lois qui ne s\u2019appliquent qu\u2019aux Indiens comme tels et qui, par cons\u00e9quent, ne s\u2019appliquent pas aux citoyens canadiens en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Cette autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative est \u00e9videmment destin\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e sur des mati\u00e8res qui, a l\u2019\u00e9gard de personnes autres que les Indiens, rel\u00e8vent de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative exclusive des provinces. On ne peut certainement pas s\u2019attendre \u00e0 une uniformit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te dans la l\u00e9gislation pro\u00advinciale, sans compter qu\u2019une diversit\u00e9 addition\u00adnelle r\u00e9sulte des lois particuli\u00e8res pour les Ter\u00adritoires. L\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 devant la loi, au sens que lui ont donn\u00e9 les cours des Territoires, exigerait que dans chaque province les Indiens soient soumis aux m\u00eames r\u00e8gles juridiques que les autres, sous tout rapport et non seulement en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9\u00adt\u00e9. En dehors des Territoires, vu la comp\u00e9tence provinciale sur l\u2019\u00e9ducation et la sant\u00e9, les autori\u00adt\u00e9s f\u00e9d\u00e9rales ne pourraient pas facilement fournir ces services sans \u00abdiscrimination\u00bb au sens des cours des Territoires. Si l\u2019un des effets de la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits est de rendre inop\u00e9rantes toutes les dispositions en vertu desquelles les Indiens en tant que tels ne sont pas trait\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que le grand public, on doit in\u00e9vitablement con\u00adclure que le Parlement, en \u00e9dictant la D\u00e9claration, n\u2019a pas seulement modifi\u00e9 fondamentalement le statut des Indiens par ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9 indirect, mais aussi qu\u2019il a assujetti l\u2019exercice futur de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gislative f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur les Indiens \u00e0 l\u2019exigence d\u2019une d\u00e9claration expresse \u00abque la loi s\u2019appliquera nonobstant la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits\u00bb. J\u2019ai peine \u00e0 croire que le Parlement avait cette intention lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9dict\u00e9 la D\u00e9claration. Si l\u2019on entendait supprimer pratiquement la l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur les Indiens, on devrait s\u2019attendre il ce que ce changement important soit fait explici\u00adtement et non subrepticement, pour ainsi dire.\nA l\u2019article 2, les mots essentiels sont que toute loi du Canada, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019exception cit\u00e9e plus haut, \u00abdoit s\u2019interpr\u00e9ter et s\u2019appliquer de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ne pas supprimer, restreindre ou en\u00adfreindre\u00bb l\u2019un quelconque des droits ou des li\u00adbert\u00e9s reconnus et d\u00e9clar\u00e9s dans la D\u00e9claration. Il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9cider si ces mots \u00e9dictent plus qu\u2019une r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation. Pris \u00e0 la lettre, je ne le crois pas. \u00abS\u2019interpr\u00e9ter\u00bb ne comporte cer\u00adtainement rien d\u2019autre. \u00abS\u2019appliquer\u00bb exprime-t-il une intention diff\u00e9rente? Je ne le pense pas. M\u00eame si cela peut sembler un truisme, je dois souligner que ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 demande \u00e0 cette Cour de faire et ce que les cours des Territoires ont effectivement fait, ce n\u2019est pas appliquer la Loi sur les Indiens, mais bien refuser de l\u2019appli\u00adquer.\nL\u2019argument le plus fort contre cette mani\u00e8re de voir dans l\u2019art. 2 une r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation c\u2019est indubitablement que par l\u00e0 l\u2019exception \u00ab\u00e0 moins qu\u2019une loi du Parlement du Canada ne d\u00e9clare express\u00e9ment qu\u2019elle s\u2019appliquera nonobstant la D\u00e9claration canadienne des droits\u00bb perd tout sens pratique. On ne peut nier que l\u2019application d\u2019une r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation n\u2019est pas normalement soumise \u00e0 une telle r\u00e9serve. Au contraire, le principe est qu\u2019elle n\u2019a aucun effet \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la volont\u00e9 clairement exprim\u00e9e du Parlement, sous quelque forme que ce soit. D\u2019autre part, en cherchant \u00e0 donner un effet \u00e0 certains mots de l\u2019art. 2 qui, pour des raisons \u00e9videntes, ne sauraient s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 aucune loi existante, il ne faut jamais oublier le point de d\u00e9part de la D\u00e9claration, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que l\u2019on y d\u00e9clare des droits et libert\u00e9s reconnus comme existants et non pas qu\u2019on les introduit ou \u00e9largit. Si, \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1, la loi signifie ce qu\u2019elle exprime et ne reconna\u00eet et d\u00e9clare que des droits et libert\u00e9s existants, jamais rien de plus qu\u2019une interpr\u00e9ta\u00adtion juste des lois existantes conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la D\u00e9claration ne peut \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre le but vis\u00e9. Il ne peut jamais \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019en d\u00e9clarer aucune inop\u00e9rante en raison d\u2019un conflit avec les droits et libert\u00e9s \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la D\u00e9\u00adclaration, vu que ceux-ci sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9s comme ils y existent. Il me para\u00eet donc que l\u2019art. 2 ne peut pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme le veut l\u2019intim\u00e9 sans venir en conflit avec l\u2019art. 1.\nSi, en ce qui concerne la l\u00e9gislation existante, il fallait choisir entre donner effet \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1 tel qu\u2019\u00e9crit et refuser d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019art. 2 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 donner un effet \u00e0 l\u2019exception, il me semble que le choix devrait donner la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance \u00e0 l\u2019art. 1. C\u2019est la disposition qui \u00e9tablit le principe sur lequel toute la loi se fonde.\nUne autre raison qui s\u2019impose c\u2019est la pr\u00e9\u00adsomption contre toute modification implicite du droit. On ne peut pr\u00e9sumer que le Parlement a l\u2019intention de d\u00e9roger au droit existant plus qu\u2019il ne le d\u00e9clare express\u00e9ment (Maxwell, On Inter\u00adpretation of Statutes, 9e ed., p. 84, cit\u00e9 dans Duchesneau c. Cook[13]). Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, les jugements des tribunaux des Territoires d\u00e9\u00adcident en fait que le Parlement, en \u00e9dictant la D\u00e9claration, a implicitement abrog\u00e9 non seulement une grande partie de la Loi sur les Indiens, mais aussi le principe fondamental que c\u2019est le devoir des tribunaux d\u2019appliquer la loi telle que r\u00e9dig\u00e9e, n\u2019\u00e9tant jamais autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 ne pas donner effet \u00e0 la volont\u00e9 clairement exprim\u00e9e du Parlement. Cela aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 une d\u00e9viation radicale de cette importante r\u00e8gle constitutionnelle britan\u00adnique que d\u2019\u00e9dicter que dor\u00e9navant les tribunaux doivent d\u00e9clarer inop\u00e9rante toute l\u00e9gislation qu\u2019ils consid\u00e8rent non conforme \u00e0 certains prin\u00adcipes juridiques \u00e9nonc\u00e9s en termes tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, ou plut\u00f4t, simplement \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s sans d\u00e9finition.\nEn v\u00e9rit\u00e9, le sens d\u2019expressions telles que \u00abl\u2019application r\u00e9guli\u00e8re de la loi\u00bb, \u00abl\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 de\u00advant la loi\u00bb, \u00abla libert\u00e9 de religion\u00bb, \u00abla libert\u00e9 de parole\u00bb, est largement ind\u00e9fini et presque illimit\u00e9. Selon les opinions individuelles et l\u2019\u00e9volution des id\u00e9es courantes, le contenu actuel de tels concepts juridiques est susceptible d\u2019exten\u00adsion et de variation, comme on peut le voir de fa\u00e7on frappante dans d\u2019autres pays. Dans le syst\u00e8me britannique traditionnel qui est le n\u00f4tre en vertu de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Nord britannique, c\u2019est le Parlement qui est exclusivement responsable de la mise \u00e0 jour de la l\u00e9gisla\u00adtion dans notre monde en \u00e9volution. Si le Parlement du Canada avait eu l\u2019intention de d\u00e9roger \u00e0 ce principe en \u00e9dictant la D\u00e9claration, on serait en droit de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 y trouver cette intention clairement exprim\u00e9e. Au contraire, ce que l\u2019on trouve \u00e0 l\u2019article 1 c\u2019est la volont\u00e9 manifeste de maintenir le principe traditionnel et d\u2019\u00e9viter l\u2019incertitude inh\u00e9rente aux lois r\u00e9dig\u00e9es en termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, en rattachant ces termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble du droit existant et, en fait, en d\u00e9cla\u00adrant les droits de l\u2019homme et libert\u00e9s fondamentales reconnus comme ils existaient alors dans les lois du Canada.\nJe ne vois pas comment on peut consid\u00e9rer que, prendre cela pour l\u2019intention fondamentale, c\u2019est m\u00e9conna\u00eetre le caract\u00e8re manifeste de la D\u00e9claration. Je ne vois pas non plus comment on peut dire que, consid\u00e9rer l\u2019article 2 comme rien de plus qu\u2019une r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, c\u2019est ne pas donner effet \u00e0 la D\u00e9claration. Sur quoi se fonde-t-on pour pr\u00e9sumer que l\u2019on a voulu faire autre chose dans une loi qui n\u2019a pas de carac\u00adt\u00e8re constitutionnel?\nQue les r\u00e8gles d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation soient de moin\u00addre importance que les r\u00e8gles constitutionnelles ne signifie pas qu\u2019elles sont sans importance. Par exemple, dans notre syst\u00e8me juridique, la non-r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 des lois, de m\u00eame que le prin\u00adcipe qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de crime sans intention coupable, ne sont rien de plus que des r\u00e8gles d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation. Cela ne veut certainement pas dire qu\u2019elles sont d\u2019importance secondaire. Des arr\u00eats comme Beaver c. La Reine[14] et La Reine c. King[15] montrent clairement \u00e0 quel point ces principes sont f\u00e9conds. Si le Parlement canadien trouvait opportun de les consacrer dans une loi, pr\u00e9tendrait-on que ceux qui par la suite diraient que leur nature fondamentale est inchang\u00e9e et qu\u2019elles demeurent des r\u00e8gles d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, ne donnent pas \u00e0 cette loi-l\u00e0 son plein effet?\nEn d\u00e9finitive, je ne trouve rien dans la D\u00e9\u00adclaration canadienne des droits qui d\u00e9montre clairement que le Parlement avait l\u2019intention d\u2019\u00e9tablir \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des droits de l\u2019homme et des libert\u00e9s fondamentales des principes primordiaux d\u2019ordre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, que les tribunaux devraient appliquer \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la volont\u00e9 clairement exprim\u00e9e du Parlement dans les lois existant \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque. A mon avis, le Parlement n\u2019a fait rien de plus que de prescrire aux tribunaux d\u2019in\u00adterpr\u00e9ter et d\u2019appliquer ces lois conform\u00e9ment aux principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la D\u00e9claration, en consid\u00e9rant que les droits et libert\u00e9s reconnus existaient alors et non pas qu\u2019ils seraient \u00e9tablis par les tribunaux.\nPour ces motifs, j\u2019accueillerais le pourvoi, j\u2019infirmerais l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel et le jugement de la Cour territoriale des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, et je r\u00e9tablirais la condamnation et la sentence. Vu les conditions de l\u2019ordonnance accordant la permission d\u2019en appeler, je pr\u00e9sume qu\u2019un arrangement satisfaisant a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu pour les frais d\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et qu\u2019aucune direc\u00adtive n\u2019est n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 ce sujet.\nDepuis que j\u2019ai \u00e9crit ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, j\u2019ai eu le privil\u00e8ge de lire les motifs du Juge en chef et je d\u00e9sire ajouter que je suis enti\u00e8rement d\u2019accord avec lui.\nAppel rejet\u00e9, LE JUGE EN CHEF CARTWRIGHT et LES JUGES ABBOTT et PIGEON \u00e9tant dissidents.\nProcureur de l\u2019appelante : D.

(a) de l\u2019annexe V de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise, S.R.C. 1952, c. 100, et que comme tels ils sont assujettis au taux moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 de la taxe de vente pr\u00e9vu a l\u2019art. 32(3) de la Loi. La Commission du tarif lui a donn\u00e9 raison, mais la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a infirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration de la Commission. La Commission en appela \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre accueilli, le Juge Pigeon \u00e9tant dissident.\nLes Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie et Hall: Si l\u2019on prend les mots \u00abfabrication\u00bb et \u00abproduction\u00bb dans leur sens normal et ordinaire, il n\u2019y a rien dans la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise qui oblige \u00e0 leur donner le sens restreint de production dans une g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice, lorsque ces mots s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 une marchandise telle que l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9. La Commission du tarif a correctement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 le par. (a) de l\u2019annexe V et elle n\u2019a pas fait d\u2019erreur de droit. La preuve justifiait amplement la conclusion de la Commission que les transformateurs sont bien en fait destin\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s \u00abdirectement dans la fabrication de marchandises\u00bb. D\u2019apr\u00e8s les dispositions de l\u2019art. 57 de la Loi, cette conclusion n\u2019est pas sujette \u00e0 revision par les tribunaux. Le Juge Pigeon, dissident: La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 sans aucune contradiction que dans le langage courant on ne d\u00e9signe jamais un transformateur comme servant \u00e0 la production de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, mais bien comme servant \u00e0 son transport ou \u00e0 sa distribution. La Commission a commis une erreur de droit en interpr\u00e9tant et appliquant le texte du par.

Pour donner effet \u00e0 l\u2019intention du Parlement de limiter l\u2019exemption \u00e0 ce qui sert \u00e0 la production de marchandises par opposition \u00e0 ce qui sert \u00e0 leur transport ou distribution, il faut s\u2019en tenir \u00e0 la distinction faite partout entre la production d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 qui a lieu uniquement dans les centrales d\u2019\u00e9nergie et le transport et la distribution qui se font par un r\u00e9seau form\u00e9 de transformateurs reli\u00e9s par des c\u00e2bles.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement du Pr\u00e9sident Jackett de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier du Canada[1], dans une affaire en vertu de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise.

La question de droit sur laquelle la permission d\u2019en appeler a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e est formul\u00e9e dans les termes suivants:\n[TRADUCTION] La Commission du tarif a-t-elle commis une erreur de droit en d\u00e9cidant que les transformateurs qui font l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente contestation sont des \u00abmachines et appareils vendus aux fabricants ou producteurs ou import\u00e9s par eux et destin\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s par eux directement dans la fabrication ou la production de marchandises\u00bb, au sens du paragraphe (a) de l\u2019Annexe V de la Loi sur ta taxe d\u2019accise? La contestation vient de l\u2019application de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise et a trait au taux de la taxe de vente applicable en vertu de la Loi \u00e0 certains transformateurs que l\u2019appelante a achet\u00e9s et emploie. La question est de savoir si les transformateurs sont des \u00abmachines et appareils vendus aux fabricants ou producteurs ou import\u00e9s par eux et destin\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s par eux directement dans la fabrication ou la production de marchandises\u00bb, aux termes du par.

L\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle vend \u00e0 ses clients est mesur\u00e9e au moyen d\u2019un compteur appropri\u00e9, en kilowatt heures; elle leur vend g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 destin\u00e9e aux accessoires d\u2019\u00e9clairage et aux accessoires ordinaires de 120 \u00e0 240 volts, bien que de nombreux clients, en particulier les municipalit\u00e9s et les industries, ach\u00e8tent parfois de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 \u00e0 des tensions bien sup\u00e9rieures.\nLes t\u00e9moignages r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que, aux stations g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrices, la requ\u00e9rante produit l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 \u00e0 partir d\u2019une source d\u2019\u00e9nergie qui n\u2019est pas de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, par exemple \u00e0 partir de la force hydraulique ou de l\u2019\u00e9nergie thermique. A ces stations o\u00f9 l\u2019on produit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de l\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique dont la tension est sensiblement plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e que celle qu\u2019emploient les clients de la requ\u00e9rante et inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle qu\u2019emploient certains autres clients, on transforme presque toujours en une tension sup\u00e9rieure l\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique produite par le g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur; lorsqu\u2019elle atteint une tension tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9e, l\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique n\u2019est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas utile \u00e0 la grande majorit\u00e9 des clients de la requ\u00e9rante; en cons\u00e9quence, la requ\u00e9rante en diminue la tension souvent \u00e0 une ou \u00e0 plusieurs sous-stations, mais, de toute fa\u00e7on, \u00e0 un certain endroit le long du r\u00e9seau, \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 du client qui en fait la consommation, au voltage auquel il l\u2019ach\u00e8te ordinairement. La plupart des consommateurs ach\u00e8tent ce genre d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, mais, en revanche, d\u2019autres clients ont besoin de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 \u00e0 haute tension; \u00e0 leur intention, la requ\u00e9rante peut en accro\u00eetre la tension plut\u00f4t que la diminuer ou, dans des cas exceptionnels, elle peut la transmettre, sans lui faire subir aucune transformation, directement \u00e0 ses clients.\nLa hausse et la baisse de la tension s\u2019effectuent par un appareil d\u00e9sign\u00e9 sous le nom de transformateur.\nL\u2019appelante a maintenu que les transformateurs qu\u2019elle emploie pour les fins d\u00e9crites dans cette partie de la d\u00e9claration de la Commission du tarif que j\u2019ai cit\u00e9e sont utilis\u00e9s \u00abdirectement dans la fabrication ou la production de marchandises\u00bb, et a demand\u00e9 une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019ils soient assujettis au taux moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 de la taxe pr\u00e9vu par l\u2019art. 32(3) de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise.\nLe sous-ministre a rejet\u00e9 la demande de l\u2019appelante, en s\u2019appuyant sur le motif suivant:\n[TRADUCTION] Quand l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 quitte la station g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice et entre dans le r\u00e9seau de distribution, le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de production est termin\u00e9 et, \u00e0 notre avis, les machines et appareils utilis\u00e9s au del\u00e0 de ce stade n\u2019entrent pas dans la cat\u00e9gorie des machines et appareils de production. Tous les transformateurs et leurs accessoires utilis\u00e9s ailleurs qu\u2019\u00e0 la station g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice pour amener l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 \u00e0 la tension requise par les clients sont assujettis \u00e0 la taxe de vente au taux de 12 p. 100.\nSe pr\u00e9valant des dispositions de l\u2019art. 57 de ladite Loi, l\u2019appelante a interjet\u00e9 appel \u00e0 la Commission du tarif pour obtenir que la Commission \u00e9mette une d\u00e9claration concernant le taux de la taxe de vente applicable auxdits transformateurs.\nLa Commission du tarif a entendu la preuve, qui traitait du commerce de l\u2019appelante, de la nature de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, du r\u00f4le et du but des transformateurs et d\u2019autres questions pertinentes. Dans sa d\u00e9claration, la Commission en arrive, entre autres, aux conclusions suivantes:\n[TRADUCTION] Il ressort des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que le courant dans l\u2019enroulement primaire d\u2019un transformateur est isol\u00e9 \u00e9lectriquement du noyau du transformateur et de l\u2019enroulement secondaire du transformateur. Par induction \u00e9lectromagn\u00e9tique, provoqu\u00e9e par l\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique du courant alterna- tif primaire, un nouveau courant alternatif distinct se produit dans l\u2019enroulement secondaire d\u2019un transformateur. Le courant dans le circuit secondaire diff\u00e8re ordinairement, non dans le nombre de watts ou de p\u00e9riodes, mais dans le nombre de volts et d\u2019amp\u00e8res. Toutefois, la fonction du transformateur ne consiste pas seulement \u00e0 transmettre le courant primaire, au sens de le faire passer, se d\u00e9placer, ou encore permettre son transport ou son acheminement du circuit primaire au circuit secondaire.\nL\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique que la requ\u00e9rante produit n\u2019est pas une denr\u00e9e qu\u2019elle vend \u00e0 ses clients ou que ceux-ci utilisent ordinairement \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait au pr\u00e9alable subi une transformation; ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 une telle transformation, elle existe sous une forme qui g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement n\u2019est pas vendable parce qu\u2019elle est impropre \u00e0 l\u2019usage de la plupart de ses clients.\n\u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que c\u2019est gr\u00e2ce au proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de transformation en question que l\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique devient utilisable par le client, il faut consid\u00e9rer que cette transformation fait partie int\u00e9grante du proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de fabrication ou de production de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9. La transformation de la tension s\u2019effectue exclusivement dans les transformateurs et par les transformateurs, appareils vendus \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante ou import\u00e9s par elle et destin\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s par elle directement \u00e0 la fabrication ou la production de marchandises.\nLa principale pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019intim\u00e9 devant la Commission du tarif, la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier et cette Cour c\u2019est que les mots \u00abfabrication ou production\u00bb lorsqu\u2019ils s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 une marchandise telle que l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 doivent s\u2019interpr\u00e9ter comme voulant dire fabrication ou production dans le sens de l\u2019anglais \u00abgeneration\u00bb, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire production d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 dans une g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice. La Commission du tarif a rejet\u00e9 cette affirmation mais le savant Pr\u00e9sident de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier l\u2019a accept\u00e9e.\nComme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le Juge en chef Duff, dans l\u2019affaire The King c. Vandeweghe Limited[2]: le mot \u00abproduction\u00bb, tout comme \u00abfabrication\u00bb n\u2019a pas un sens tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cis, par cons\u00e9quent, il faut examiner le contexte pour en fixer la port\u00e9e dans les dispositions que nous devons interpr\u00e9ter. N\u00e9anmoins, si l\u2019on prend ces mots dans leur sens normal et ordinaire, il n\u2019y a rien dans la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise qui oblige \u00e0 leur donner un sens aussi restreint que le voudrait l\u2019intim\u00e9. De plus, leur donner un tel sens serait contraire \u00e0 la preuve qu\u2019a accept\u00e9e la Commission. A mon avis, la Commission a correctement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 le par. (a) de l\u2019annexe V de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise et elle n\u2019a pas fait d\u2019erreur de droit.\nLa Commission a jug\u00e9 que les transformateurs qui font l\u2019objet du litige dans le pr\u00e9sent appel sont bien en fait \u00abdes machines et des appareils vendus \u00e0 l\u2019appelante ou import\u00e9s par elle et destin\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s par elle pour la fabrication de marchandises\u00bb. La preuve justifiait amplement cette conclusion et, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les dispositions de l\u2019art. 57 de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise, cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019est pas sujette \u00e0 r\u00e9vision par les tribunaux.\nJ\u2019accueillerais l\u2019appel, j\u2019annulerais l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier et je r\u00e9tablirais la d\u00e9claration de la Commission du tarif. L\u2019appelante a droit aux d\u00e9pens, dans toutes les Cours.\nLE JUGE PIGEON (dissident)\u2014En vertu de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise la taxe de vente \u00e9tait, jusqu\u2019au 31 mars 1968, payable \u00e0 un taux r\u00e9duit sur les articles \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019Annexe V. Le par. (a) de cette annexe se lit comme suit:\n(a) les machines et appareils vendus aux fabricants ou producteurs ou import\u00e9s par eux et destin\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s par eux directement dans la fabrication ou la production de marchandises.\nL\u2019appelante soutient que les transformateurs qu\u2019elle utilise dans son entreprise de production et de distribution d\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique sont des appareils utilis\u00e9s \u00abdirectement dans la fabrication ou la production de marchandises\u00bb au sens de cette disposition. La Commission du tarif lui a donn\u00e9 raison. Sur appel, le Pr\u00e9sident de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier[3] a infirm\u00e9 cette d\u00e9claration la consid\u00e9rant comme erron\u00e9e en droit, de l\u00e0 le pourvoi.\nIl est admis que l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 est une marchandise au sens de la loi dont il s\u2019agit car elle est mentionn\u00e9e au par. 3 de la Partie VI de l\u2019Annexe III o\u00f9 l\u2019on \u00e9num\u00e8re les marchandises exempt\u00e9es de la taxe de vente. Toute la question est donc de savoir si les transformateurs doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme utilis\u00e9s dans la \u00abproduction\u00bb de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9. En effet, le mot \u00abfabrication\u00bb ne peut pas facilement y \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9. Comme le juge en chef Duff l\u2019a fait observer dans The King c. Vandeweghe Ltd.[4] le mot \u00abproduction\u00bb, tout comme \u00abfabrication\u00bb, n\u2019a pas un sens tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cis, par cons\u00e9quent, il faut examiner le contexte pour en fixer la port\u00e9e. Ici, le contexte indique nettement \u00e0 mon avis que le Parlement a \u00e9tabli une distinction fond\u00e9e sur les principales cat\u00e9gories d\u2019activit\u00e9 \u00e9conomique g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement reconnues. Un taux r\u00e9duit de taxe de vente ou une exemption compl\u00e8te suivant l\u2019\u00e9poque, a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu pour les appareils utilis\u00e9s directement dans la production de marchandises, mais cette faveur ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 ce qui est utilis\u00e9 dans le transport ou la distribution. Le par. (d) de l\u2019Annexe V mentionne le mat\u00e9riel \u00abdevant servir au transport des d\u00e9chets ou des rebuts des machines et appareils\u00bb utilis\u00e9s dans la fabrication ou production ce qui indique bien que, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le mat\u00e9riel de transport n\u2019est pas vis\u00e9. Au par. (e), on mentionne de m\u00eame les camions servant exclusivement aux mines et aux carri\u00e8res hors des grandes routes, et au par. (f), les tracteurs \u00e0 combusion interne servant aux exploitations foresti\u00e8res mais seulement pour le transport des billes de la souche \u00e0 un moyen de transport r\u00e9gulier.\nL\u2019appelante a essentiellement fond\u00e9 son argumentation sur le fait que dans un transformateur les enroulements o\u00f9 circule l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 sont isol\u00e9s l\u2019un de l\u2019autre de telle sorte que le courant \u00e9lectrique qui en sort n\u2019est pas celui qui y p\u00e9n\u00e8tre. Le courant alternatif que l\u2019appareil livre est ordinairement \u00e0 un voltage diff\u00e9rent de celui qui y p\u00e9n\u00e8tre et on affirme que cette transformation donne \u00e0 la marchandise la forme sous laquelle elle est livr\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019usager. Un t\u00e9moin a \u00e9t\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9clarer que techniquement ou scientifiquement on pouvait dire qu\u2019un transformateur \u00abproduit\u00bb de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9. On pourrait peut-\u00eatre le dire mais le fait est qu\u2019on ne le dit pas et si on ne le dit pas c\u2019est parce que dans le langage courant l\u2019op\u00e9ration est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e sous l\u2019aspect \u00e9conomique et ce que l\u2019on appelle \u00abproduction d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9\u00bb c\u2019est uniquement la production d\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique en partant d\u2019une autre forme d\u2019\u00e9nergie.\nLa preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 sans aucune contradiction que dans le langage courant on ne d\u00e9signe jamais un transformateur comme un appareil servant \u00e0 la production de l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 mais bien comme un appareil servant \u00e0 son transport ou \u00e0 sa distribution. Il est vrai que par suite de sa nature sp\u00e9ciale, l\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique doit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, pour son transport et sa distribution \u00eatre transform\u00e9e et retransform\u00e9e et que cela se fait en produisant par induction dans des transformateurs un nouveau courant. Cependant, comme l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 est produite sous forme de courant alternatif pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour permettre cette transformation et retransformation, on ne consid\u00e8re pas ces changements de voltage comme une partie de l\u2019op\u00e9ration \u00abproduction d\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique\u00bb mais comme un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de son transport et de sa distribution. C\u2019est ainsi que dans le vocabulaire usuel on entend l\u2019expression \u00abproduction d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9\u00bb.\nC\u2019est l\u00e0 le crit\u00e8re qui devait guider la Commission du tarif dans sa d\u00e9cision. Pour interpr\u00e9ter et appliquer la loi, elle ne devait pas rechercher comment on pouvait, d\u2019un point de vue scientifique ou technique, envisager la fonction des transformateurs. Elle devait se demander comment cette fonction est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e et d\u00e9crite dans le langage courant. Il est bien \u00e9tabli que ce n\u2019est pas en regard de la th\u00e9orie scientifique ou technique qu\u2019il faut interpr\u00e9ter les lois. On doit, au contraire, s\u2019en tenir au sens usuel des mots (Continental Soya Co. Ltd. c. J.R. Short Milling Co. (Canada) Ltd.[5]; Laboratoire Pentagone Limit\u00e9e c. Parke Davis & Co.[6]).\nA mon avis, la Commission a commis une erreur de droit en interpr\u00e9tant et appliquant le texte du par. (a) de l\u2019Annexe V de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise autrement que d\u2019apr\u00e8s le sens usuel du mot \u00abproduction\u00bb appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 et en faisant pr\u00e9valoir contre le sens usuel la mani\u00e8re de voir d\u2019un savant ou d\u2019un technicien sur la fonction des transformateurs alors que c\u2019est la mani\u00e8re de voir populaire exprim\u00e9e dans le langage courant qu\u2019il fallait suivre.\nPour donner effet \u00e0 l\u2019intention du Parlement de limiter l\u2019exemption dont il s\u2019agit \u00e0 ce qui sert \u00e0 la production de marchandises par opposition \u00e0 ce qui sert \u00e0 leur transport ou distribution, il fallait s\u2019en tenir \u00e0 la distinction faite partout entre la production d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 qui a lieu uniquement dans les centrales d\u2019\u00e9nergie et le transport et la distribution qui se font par un r\u00e9seau form\u00e9 de transformateurs reli\u00e9s par des c\u00e2bles.\nJe n\u2019oublie pas que d\u2019apr\u00e8s plusieurs d\u00e9cisions le fait de donner \u00e0 une marchandise la forme requise pour la rendre acceptable \u00e0 l\u2019usager est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une partie essentielle de la production sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019importance de la transformation (La Reine c. York Marble Tile & Terrazo Ltd.[7]). Ce principe ne doit pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 autre chose que ce qui constitue dans l\u2019acception courante du langage une op\u00e9ration de production de marchandises. Dans toutes les causes o\u00f9 on l\u2019a appliqu\u00e9, que ce soit \u00e0 des pi\u00e8ces de marbre, \u00e0 des fourrures, \u00e0 des montres ou \u00e0 autre chose, il y avait toujours au sens usuel \u00abproduction\u00bb d\u2019un article de commerce. C\u2019est l\u00e0 ce qui fait d\u00e9faut dans le cas pr\u00e9sent.\nJe dois ajouter que m\u00eame sous l\u2019aspect technique ou scientifique, le Pr\u00e9sident de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier me para\u00eet avoir \u00e0 bon droit conclu que la Commission du tarif avait fait erreur. En effet, je pense qu\u2019il a raison de dire qu\u2019au sens de l\u2019Annexe V de la Loi sur la taxe d\u2019accise \u00ab\u00e9lectricit\u00e9\u00bb veut dire \u00ab\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique\u00bb car ce que l\u2019appelante vend se mesure en kilowatt-heures, une unit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9nergie. C\u2019est donc l\u2019\u00e9nergie \u00e9lectrique qui est vendue et livr\u00e9e et non pas le courant qui la v\u00e9hicule. Cependant, je ne suis pas s\u00fbr que cet aspect de la question soit un probl\u00e8me de droit. Au contraire, il me para\u00eet \u00e9vident que le sens \u00e0 donner \u00e0 la disposition qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019appliquer dans le cas pr\u00e9sent est bien exclusivement une question de droit (Canadian Lift Truck c.

Le premier jour du proc\u00e8s et apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9position d\u2019un des t\u00e9moins de la poursuite, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une reconnaissance \u00e9crite de certains faits et a demand\u00e9 que cette d\u00e9cla- ration soit re\u00e7ue conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019art. 562 du Code criminel.

Lorsqu\u2019on veut se pr\u00e9valoir de l\u2019art. 562, il appartient \u00e0 la poursuite et non \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense de pr\u00e9senter le ou les faits qu\u2019elle all\u00e8gue contre le pr\u00e9venu et qu\u2019elle veut lui faire admettre.

La preuve m\u00e9dicale et scientifique a clairement \u00e9tabli que son d\u00e9c\u00e8s est r\u00e9sult\u00e9 d\u2019un empoisonnement par l\u2019arsenic et qu\u2019elle avait absorb\u00e9 des doses d\u2019arsenic durant plusieurs mois avant son d\u00e9c\u00e8s. C\u2019est l\u00e0 un fait que la d\u00e9fense n\u2019a pas d\u00e9ni\u00e9. Il s\u2019agissait donc pour les jur\u00e9s de savoir s\u2019ils \u00e9taient convaincus hors de tout doute raisonnable que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait la personne qui avait administr\u00e9 le poison \u00e0 la victime. C\u2019est \u00e0 bon droit que le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a dit au jury qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait que deux verdicts possibles: \u00abnon coupable\u00bb ou \u00abcoupable de meurtre qualifi\u00e9\u00bb.\nLes Juges d\u2019appel Norris et Bull ont ainsi correctement r\u00e9sum\u00e9 les griefs d\u2019appel devant la Cour d\u2019appel:\n[TRADUCTION] 1.

En raison du caract\u00e8re circonstanciel de la preuve, le jury ne peut pas avoir accord\u00e9 l\u2019importance qu\u2019il aurait d\u00fb \u00e0 la directive du savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance au sujet du principe \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019affaire Hodge (1838) 2 Lewin 227, 168 E.R. 1136, soit la doctrine du doute raisonnable, de telle sorte que son verdict est contraire \u00e0 la preuve ou d\u00e9raisonnable.\nQuant au premier de ces motifs, il ressort que le 25 septembre 1967, soit le premier jour du proc\u00e8s et apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9position d\u2019un des t\u00e9moins de la poursuite, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une reconnaissance \u00e9crite de certains faits \u00abpour dispenser la Couronne d\u2019en faire le preuve\u00bb et a demand\u00e9 que cette d\u00e9claration soit re\u00e7ue conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019art. 562 du Code criminel, qui se lit comme suit:\n562.

Que le 28 juillet 1965, \u00e0 la succursale Broadway et Gambie de la Banque de Commerce canadienne imp\u00e9riale, \u00e0 Vancouver, Ren\u00e9 \u00c9mile Castellani a sign\u00e9 une certaine formule de demande d\u2019emprunt de la Kinross Mortgage Corporation en pr\u00e9sence de M.R.S. Keyes;\n6. Qu\u2019aucune action ou proc\u00e9dure en dissolution du mariage qui unissait Ren\u00e9 \u00c9mile Castellani et Esther Castellani, c\u00e9l\u00e9br\u00e9 le 16 juillet 1946, n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e devant aucun tribunal comp\u00e9tent;\n7. Que Mme Thompson a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 des \u00e9preuves scientifiques connues sous le nom de proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de diffraction des rayons X au Crime Detection Laboratory du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Ontario, dans le but de d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 l\u2019aide de cheveux pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s sur le cadavre d\u2019Esther Castellani de quel sel ou compos\u00e9 provenait l\u2019arsenic, mais que les r\u00e9sultats n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 concluants parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas suffisamment de cheveux;\n8. Que Ren\u00e9 \u00c9mile Castellani et Adelaide Miller ont eu ensemble des relations sexuelles extraconjugales entre l\u2019automne de 1964 et le printemps de 1966 approximativement.\nCette d\u00e9claration est dat\u00e9e du 25 septembre 1967 et porte la signature des deux avocats qui ont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 l\u2019appelant au proc\u00e8s.\nL\u2019avocat de la poursuite ayant soulev\u00e9 une objection, l\u2019argumentation sur la question a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise au lendemain. Pendant l\u2019ajournement, les avocats des deux parties se sont entendus pour admettre les sept premiers paragraphes, mais l\u2019avocat de la poursuite s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019inclusion du paragraphe n\u00b0 8, tandis que celui de l\u2019appelant soutenait qu\u2019en vertu de l\u2019art. 562 il avait le droit de faire cet aveu et avait l\u2019intention de le faire.\nA la suite de l\u2019argumentation en l\u2019absence du jury, le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance, apr\u00e8s avoir dit qu\u2019il regrettait que l\u2019avocat de la pour- suite n\u2019ait pas jug\u00e9 bon d\u2019accepter la d\u00e9claration telle que soumise, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 la poursuite pr\u00e9sentait sa preuve la d\u00e9fense ne pouvait pas faire d\u2019aveu \u00e0 moins que la poursuite ne consente \u00e0 l\u2019accepter. Plus tard, les deux parties ont sign\u00e9 et produit une d\u00e9claration reproduisant les sept premiers paragraphes, mais l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant a soutenu qu\u2019ils avaient, lui et son client, le droit d\u2019exiger l\u2019inclusion des faits mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe n\u00b0 8.\nLa Cour d\u2019appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis que le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance aurait d\u00fb accorder la permission d\u2019admettre les faits mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe n\u00b0 8, les termes de l\u2019art. 562 accordant \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9, selon son interpr\u00e9tation, un droit inconditionnel d\u2019admettre tout fait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 contre lui. On a donc jug\u00e9 que le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance avait commis une erreur de droit. Mais, la Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que cette erreur n\u2019avait caus\u00e9 aucun pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019appelant et qu\u2019il n\u2019en \u00e9tait pas r\u00e9sult\u00e9 un tort important ou une erreur judiciaire. Si j\u2019\u00e9tais de l\u2019avis de la Cour d\u2019appel, savoir que le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a fait une erreur de droit sur la question pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, je serais \u00e9galement d\u2019accord avec elle que cette erreur n\u2019a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 aucun tort important ni \u00e0 une erreur judiciaire, mais, en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne suis pas d\u2019avis que le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a commis une erreur en d\u00e9cidant comme il l\u2019a fait.\nDans une affaire criminelle, vu qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de proc\u00e9dures \u00e9crites, il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019all\u00e9gations pr\u00e9cises des faits susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre admis de fa\u00e7on absolue. Un pr\u00e9venu ne peut admettre un fait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 contre lui avant que l\u2019all\u00e9gation en ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. Lorsqu\u2019on veut se pr\u00e9valoir de l\u2019art. 562, il appartient \u00e0 la poursuite et non \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense de pr\u00e9senter le ou les faits qu\u2019elle all\u00e8gue contre le pr\u00e9venu et qu\u2019elle veut lui faire admettre. Bien entendu, le pr\u00e9venu n\u2019est aucunement tenu d\u2019admettre le fait all\u00e9gu\u00e9; il lui appartient de l\u2019admettre ou de refuser de le faire. Il ne peut pas choisir les termes d\u2019une all\u00e9gation de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 servir ses propres fins et ensuite exiger que cette all\u00e9gation soit admise. Permettre une telle mani\u00e8re de faire n\u2019am\u00e8nerait que de la confusion. L\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019admettre une all\u00e9gation implique le concours de deux personnes, l\u2019une qui fait l\u2019all\u00e9gation et l\u2019autre qui l\u2019admet.\nJ\u2019en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion ci-dessus quant au sens et \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de l\u2019art. 562 en \u00e9tudiant les termes m\u00eames de cet article et ce que le concept d\u2019admettre l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019un fait dans une affaire criminelle implique n\u00e9cessairement. S\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de s\u2019en rapporter aux r\u00e8gles d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, mon opinion se trouverait renforc\u00e9e par l\u2019application de celles qu\u2019a exprim\u00e9es Lord Coke dans l\u2019affaire Heydon[2]. Il semble assez certain qu\u2019avant l\u2019adoption de l\u2019art. 690 du Code criminel de 1892, qui correspond \u00e0 l\u2019art. 562, un inculp\u00e9 accus\u00e9 d\u2019un crime (felony) n\u2019avait pas la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019admettre un fait, m\u00eame s\u2019il d\u00e9sirait le faire et si l\u2019avocat de la poursuite y consentait. C\u2019est ce qui ressort du passage ci-apr\u00e8s du rapport des commissaires qui ont r\u00e9dig\u00e9 le projet de code anglais en 1879. Ce passage est cit\u00e9 dans le Code criminel du Juge Taschereau (1893) 3e \u00e9dition, \u00e0 la p. 800:\n[TRADUCTION] Actuellement, si l\u2019on peut prouver qu\u2019un pr\u00e9venu a admis un fait avant son proc\u00e8s, ce fait est admissible en preuve contre lui, mais si le pr\u00e9venu veut admettre le m\u00eame fait devant le tribunal, on croit que dans le cas d\u2019une accusation de crime (felony) le juge doit lui interdire de le faire.\nLe Juge d\u2019appel Osler, en rendant le jugement au nom de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ontario dans l\u2019affaire Regina v. St. Clair[3], exprime \u00e0 la p. 311 la m\u00eame opinion au sujet de la r\u00e8gle de common law:\n[TRADUCTION] \u2026D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019ancienne et utile classification des actes criminels en crimes et infractions (felonies and misdemeanours), classification dont l\u2019abandon est, \u00e0 mon avis, tr\u00e8s regrettable, ce dont on a accus\u00e9 l\u2019inculp\u00e9e est une simple infraction et la capacit\u00e9 de celle-ci ou de son avocat d\u2019admettre des faits au moment du proc\u00e8s pour les fins de ce proc\u00e8s \u00e9tait indiscutable.\nDans l\u2019affaire Rex v. Foster, (1836) 7 C. & P. 495, l\u2019inculp\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 acquitt\u00e9 d\u2019une accusation du crime d\u2019avoir eu en sa possession un moule servant \u00e0 fabriquer de la monnaie. Il subissait son proc\u00e8s sur une deuxi\u00e8me accusation semblable \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re, o\u00f9 la preuve devait \u00eatre la m\u00eame. L\u2019avocat de la poursuite a alors d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019avec le consentement de l\u2019avocat de l\u2019accus\u00e9 il proposait de ne pas rappeler les t\u00e9moins. Le Juge Patteson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne croyait pas qu\u2019on pouvait proc\u00e9der de la sorte pour une accusation de crime (felony), m\u00eame de consentement mutuel, bien qu\u2019il s\u00fbt qu\u2019on pouvait le faire pour une accusation d\u2019infraction (misdemeanour). Les t\u00e9moins ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s, asserment\u00e9s \u00e0 nouveau et les t\u00e9moignages qu\u2019ils avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 rendus leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 lus d\u2019apr\u00e8s les notes du Juge.\nA mon avis, le but qu\u2019on se proposait en \u00e9dictant l\u2019art. 562 et les textes ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e9tait de modifier la r\u00e8gle de common law et d\u2019\u00e9carter la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 o\u00f9 se trouvait la poursuite, dans les proc\u00e8s pour actes criminels, de faire la preuve de tout fait qu\u2019elle voulait \u00e9tablir et que le pr\u00e9venu consentait \u00e0 admettre lors du proc\u00e8s.\nQuant \u00e0 tous les autres motifs invoqu\u00e9s devant la Cour d\u2019appel et devant nous, je me trouve si compl\u00e8tement d\u2019accord avec les motifs du Juge d\u2019appel Bull que je me borne \u00e0 y souscrire. Il ne servirait \u00e0 rien de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter ou de r\u00e9sumer ce qu\u2019il a \u00e9crit. Chacun des savants Juges de la Cour d\u2019appel a rempli le devoir que leur impose l\u2019art. 583A(3) du Code criminel et aucun d\u2019eux n\u2019a pu trouver au dossier de motifs, autres que ceux qui sont invoqu\u00e9s dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel, qui les aurait justifi\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9carter la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9.\nJe suis d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi.\nAppel rejet\u00e9.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelant: Kincaid, Epstein & MacLean, Vancouver.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9e: Boyd, King & Toy, Vancouver.\n[1] (1968), 65 W.W.R. 513, [1969] 1 C.C.C. 327.\n[2] (1584), 3 Co.

Ottewell, se sont l\u00e9gu\u00e9 mutuellement l\u2019universalit\u00e9 de leurs biens. Le testament de Frank \u00e9tait r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans les m\u00eames termes que celui de Fred, mutatis mutandis. Fred est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 quelque deux ans et demi avant Frank et sa succession, compos\u00e9e uniquement de biens mobiliers, est pass\u00e9e \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re. Le testateur Frank est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 et a laiss\u00e9 dans sa succession des biens meubles et des biens immeubles.\nL\u2019appelante est la fille unique et la seule parente de Fred. Les intim\u00e9s, de m\u00eame que l\u2019appelante, sont les parents de Frank habiles \u00e0 lui succ\u00e9der ab intestat. En revendiquant la totalit\u00e9 du r\u00e9sidu de la succession de Frank, l\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tend que les mots qui terminent la clause du legs r\u00e9siduaire \u00abpour les poss\u00e9der, lui, ses h\u00e9ritiers, ses ex\u00e9cuteurs et administrateurs de fa\u00e7on absolue et \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9\u00bb impliquent une substitution et non une d\u00e9volution du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Le juge en chambre et la majorit\u00e9 de la Chambre d\u2019appel ont statu\u00e9 que les mots en question sont des termes de d\u00e9volution de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et, en cons\u00e9quence, ont rejet\u00e9 la r\u00e9clamation de l\u2019appelante.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLes termes du testament en question sont depuis longtemps interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s comme indiquant la d\u00e9volution de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et non une substitution. Il n\u2019est plus n\u00e9cessaire de les ins\u00e9rer pour l\u00e9guer la pleine pro- pri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019immeubles et ils sont impropres dans un legs de biens meubles; mais cela ne change ni leur sens ni leur effet. La r\u00e8gle que le legs de biens mobiliers \u00e0 une personne et \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers a pour effet de transmettre \u00e0 la personne nomm\u00e9e la pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 s\u2019applique \u00e9galement aux legs mixtes de biens meubles et immeubles.\nLe sens du testament est clair; il ne comporte aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9. L\u2019examen des circonstances qui ont entour\u00e9 sa signature ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 cach\u00e9e, et elles ne sont donc pas pertinentes.\nArr\u00eat suivi: In re McElligott; Grant v.

L\u2019appelante, fille unique et seule parente de Fred. S. Ottewell revendique la totalit\u00e9 du r\u00e9sidu. Les intim\u00e9s pr\u00e9tendent que le r\u00e9sidu se divise entre les plus proches parents du testateur. Si leur pr\u00e9tention est accueillie, l\u2019appelante n\u2019aura droit qu\u2019\u00e0 un huiti\u00e8me de ce r\u00e9sidu.\nCertains faits, outre ceux que j\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9s plus haut, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 admis devant les Cours d\u2019Alberta. Je vais les \u00e9noncer sans m\u2019arr\u00eater \u00e0 examiner leur pertinence.\nFrank C. Ottewell et son fr\u00e8re jumeau Fred S. Ottewell \u00e9taient cultivateurs dans le district de Clover Bar, en Alberta. Lors du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Fred, ils habitaient ensemble depuis quelques ann\u00e9es. Frank C. Ottewell, le testateur, \u00e9tait c\u00e9libataire; son fr\u00e8re, Fred S. Ottewell, \u00e9tait divorc\u00e9. Ce dernier a fait son testament le 5 mai 1957 et Frank C. Ottewell a fait le sien le 19 juin 1957. Le testament de Frank C. Ottewell \u00e9tait r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans les m\u00eames termes que celui de Fred S. Ottewell, mutatis mutandis, sauf le legs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9glise-Unie de Clover Bar au testament de Frank C. Ottewell, ils se l\u00e9guaient mutuellement l\u2019universalit\u00e9 de leurs biens. Les deux testaments ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par les m\u00eames avocats, \u00e0 Edmonton et l\u2019avocat Bruce D. Patterson a attest\u00e9 les deux \u00e0 titre de t\u00e9moin. Lorsqu\u2019ils ont sign\u00e9 leurs testaments les jumeaux Ottewell avaient 52 ans et l\u2019appelante avait 30 ans. Outre l\u2019appelante, les plus proches parents de Frank C. Ottewell habiles \u00e0 lui succ\u00e9der ab intestat en 1957 \u00e9taient:\n\u2014un fr\u00e8re de 75 ans\n\u2014une soeur de 74 ans\n\u2014un fr\u00e8re de 71 ans\n\u2014une soeur de 78 ans\n\u2014un fr\u00e8re de 70 ans\n\u2014trois ni\u00e8ces de 21, 18 et 14 ans respectivement, filles d\u2019un fr\u00e8re pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 en 1950\n\u2014une soeur qui est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e en 1961 laissant un fils \u00e2g\u00e9 de 41 ans en 1957.\nFred S. Ottewell est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le 15 juin 1965; sa succession compos\u00e9e de biens mobiliers avait une valeur nette de $125,862.98. Elle est pass\u00e9e \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re, Frank C. Ottewell.\nL\u2019appelante pr\u00e9tend que les mots qui terminent la clause du legs r\u00e9siduaire \u00abpour les poss\u00e9der, lui, ses h\u00e9ritiers, ses ex\u00e9cuteurs et administrateurs de fa\u00e7on absolue et \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9\u00bb impliquent une substitution et non une d\u00e9volution du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Je ne puis trouver de fondement \u00e0 cette th\u00e9orie ni dans l\u2019abondante jurisprudence cit\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audition, ni dans la doctrine. Des d\u00e9cisions comme l\u2019affaire In Re Marshall Estate[2] o\u00f9 il s\u2019agit de testaments dans lesquels le legs ou la disposition sont \u00ab\u00e0 X ou ses h\u00e9ritiers\u00bb ne sont d\u2019aucune utilit\u00e9. Les termes du testament que nous examinons sont depuis longtemps interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s comme indiquant la d\u00e9volution de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et non une substitution. Il est bien vrai qu\u2019il n\u2019est plus n\u00e9cessaire de les ins\u00e9rer pour l\u00e9guer la pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019immeubles et que, comme le fait remarquer le Juge Vaisey dans l\u2019affaire In re McElligott; Grant v. McElligott[3], ils sont impropres dans un legs de biens meubles, mais cela ne change ni leur sens ni leur effet. Je suis d\u2019accord avec le Juge Vaisey quand il dit, dans ses motifs de jugement dans la derni\u00e8re affaire susmentionn\u00e9e, cit\u00e9s par le Juge d\u2019appel Johnson:\n[TRADUCTION] \u2026sans aucun doute possible, je crois, le legs de biens mobiliers \u00e0 une personne et \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers a pour effet de transmettre \u00e0 la personne nomm\u00e9e la pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ses termes \u00e9tant suffisants \u00e0 cette fin bien qu\u2019ils soient impropres.\nJe suis d\u2019accord avec le Juge d\u2019appel Johnson que cette r\u00e8gle s\u2019applique \u00e9galement aux legs mixtes de biens meubles et immeubles.\nA mon avis, dans le trait\u00e9 de Theobald, Wills, 12e Ed., art. 417, p. 127, on trouve un bon expos\u00e9 du r\u00f4le d\u2019un tribunal en mati\u00e8re d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation:\n[TRADUCTION] Ce qu\u2019il faut faire d\u2019abord, c\u2019est interpr\u00e9ter le testament. Le sens \u00e0 donner, suivant les r\u00e8gles d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, aux mots qu\u2019on y trouve ne saurait \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 par la consid\u00e9ration des circonstances entourant la signature du testament. Il ne faut pas d\u2019abord rechercher les circonstances particuli\u00e8res, et ensuite, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces circonstances, interpr\u00e9ter le testament, mais bien interpr\u00e9ter d\u2019abord le testament. Si le sens est clair, on ne peut consid\u00e9rer les circonstances particuli\u00e8res pour mettre ce sens en question ou pour en chercher un autre.\nA mon avis, le sens de ce testament-ci est clair; il ne comporte aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9. L\u2019examen des circonstances qui ont entour\u00e9 sa signature ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 cach\u00e9e, et elles ne sont donc pas pertinentes. Le Juge en Chef Milvain et la majorit\u00e9 de la Chambre d\u2019appel ont correctement interp\u00e9t\u00e9 le testament.\nDans l\u2019ensemble, je suis d\u2019accord avec les motifs qu\u2019ont donn\u00e9s le Juge en chef Milvain et le Juge d\u2019appel Johnson \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les mots extraits de la clause du legs r\u00e9siduaire sont des termes de d\u00e9volution de propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nJe suis d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi. A la question que cette Cour leur a pos\u00e9e, tous les avocats en cette cause ont r\u00e9pondu que quel que soit le r\u00e9sultat du pourvoi, vu la dissidence \u00e0 la Chambre d\u2019appel, la succession devrait payer les d\u00e9pens de toutes les parties repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es ici. Aussi, mais, non sans quelque h\u00e9sitation, j\u2019en ordonne ainsi.\nAppel rejet\u00e9.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelante: Macdonald, Spitz & Lavall\u00e9e, Edmonton.\nProcureurs des intim\u00e9s, Ella Hamilton, George Ottewell, John Devereux and Jennie Smith: Field, Hyndman, Field, Owen, Blakey & Bodner, Edmonton.\nProcureurs des intim\u00e9s, William J.

En 1964, elle a employ\u00e9 ce mot sur les cartons contenant ses bouteilles de bi\u00e8re Pilsener. En 1966, la d\u00e9fenderesse a \u00e9t\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re \u00e0 placer la bi\u00e8re en cannettes sur le march\u00e9 en Colombie-Britannique et a employ\u00e9 le mot \u00abPilcan\u00bb sur ses cannettes et sur les cartons contenant ses cannettes. Durant la p\u00e9riode pertinente, aucun autre concurrent n\u2019a mis de la bi\u00e8re en cannettes sur le march\u00e9 dans cette province. Il y a une preuve qui fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la d\u00e9fenderesse vend \u00e9galement de la bi\u00e8re sous des appellations semblables \u00e0 des marques bien connues de bi\u00e8res am\u00e9ricaines. La demanderesse a poursuivi en vertu de l\u2019art. 7(b) de la Loi sur les marques de commerce, 1952-53 (Can.), c. 49. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu que la d\u00e9fenderesse, par l\u2019utilisation du mot \u00abPilcan\u00bb et la pr\u00e9sentation de l\u2019emballage de ses cannettes de bi\u00e8re Pilsener a appel\u00e9 l\u2019attention du public sur ses marchandises de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 causer ou \u00e0 vraisemblablement causer de la confusion en Colombie-Britannique au sens de l\u2019art. 7(b) de la Loi. La d\u00e9fenderesse en a appel\u00e9 \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre accueilli.\nEn comparant les \u00e9tiquettes et les emballages dont se servent la d\u00e9fenderesse et la demanderesse respectivement, on ne peut pas dire qu\u2019un acheteur de bi\u00e8re Pilsener pourrait \u00eatre tromp\u00e9, induit en erreur ou embrouill\u00e9 au point de prendre la bi\u00e8re de la d\u00e9fenderesse pour celle de la demanderesse. Il n\u2019y a tout simplement pas de ressemblance appr\u00e9ciable dans les \u00e9tiquettes et les emballages qui puisse probablement ou vraisemblablement causer de la confusion. La demanderesse ne vend pas sa bi\u00e8re Pilsener dans des cannettes et la d\u00e9fenderesse ne vend pas la sienne en bouteilles. Les emballages sont aussi diff\u00e9rents que deux emballages de bi\u00e8re peuvent l\u2019\u00eatre, tant par la forme que par la couleur.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement du Juge Gibson de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier du Canada[1], accueillant une action sous l\u2019art. 7(b) de la Loi sur les marques de commerce. Appel accueilli.\nW.J. Wallace, c.r., pour la d\u00e9fenderesse, appellante.\nChristopher Robinson, c.r., et James Kokonis, pour la demanderesse, intim\u00e9e.\nLe jugement de la Cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par\nLE JUGE HALL\u2014Le pourvoi est a l\u2019encontre d\u2019un jugement du Juge Gibson, de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier du Canada1, o\u00f9 il a conclu que l\u2019appelante, par l\u2019utilisation du mot \u00abPilcan\u00bb et la pr\u00e9sentation de l\u2019emballage de ses cannettes de bi\u00e8re Pilsener a appel\u00e9 l\u2019attention du public sur ses marchandises \u00abde mani\u00e8re \u00e0 causer ou \u00e0 vraisemblablement causer de la confusion\u00bb en Colombie-Britannique entre la bi\u00e8re Pilsener dite \u00abPilcan\u00bb de l\u2019appelante (Tartan) et la bi\u00e8re Pilsener dite \u00abPil\u00bb de l\u2019intim\u00e9e (Carling) au sens de l\u2019art. 7(b) de la Loi sur les marques de commerce, 1-2 Eliz. II, c. 49.\nLa bi\u00e8re Pilsener a \u00e9t\u00e9 brass\u00e9e originairement dans la ville de Pilsen, en Boh\u00e8me (maintenant la Tch\u00e9coslovaquie), il y a environ 125 ans. En cons\u00e9quence, ni l\u2019appelante, ni l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019ont de droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ni de droit exclusif \u00e0 l\u2019appellation \u00abPilsener\u00bb.\nL\u2019appelante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019occupent toutes deux de la fabrication de la bi\u00e8re, dont la bi\u00e8re Pilsener, en Colombie-Britannique. La brasserie de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est dans la r\u00e9gion de Vancouver et celle de l\u2019appelante \u00e0 Prince George, dans le centre-nord de la Colombie-Britannique. Ils se font concurrence dans la vente de la bi\u00e8re Pilsener depuis 1962.\nEn 1963, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a con\u00e7u et lanc\u00e9 une campagne de vente de sa bi\u00e8re Pilsener. Pour mieux lancer l\u2019affaire, elle a eu recours \u00e0 des agents de publicit\u00e9 et elle y a consacr\u00e9 beaucoup de temps et d\u2019argent. Pour sa campagne de vente, elle a choisi et employ\u00e9 le mot \u00abPil\u00bb sur les capsules des bouteilles de bi\u00e8re Pilsener qu\u2019elle vend en Colombie-Britannique de m\u00eame que dans sa publicit\u00e9 dans les journaux. En 1964, elle a employ\u00e9 le mot \u00abPil\u00bb sur les cartons contenant ses bouteilles de bi\u00e8re Pilsener. A compter de cette date, elle a vendu toute sa bi\u00e8re Pilsener de cette fa\u00e7on en Colombie-Britannique.\nL\u2019appelante avait, au m\u00eame moment, mis sa bi\u00e8re Pilsener sur le march\u00e9 en bouteilles portant la marque de commerce \u00abTartan Pilsner\u00bb. Avant le milieu de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1966, toute la bi\u00e8re vendue en Colombie-Britannique \u00e9tait en bouteilles. En juillet 1966, l\u2019appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re \u00e0 placer la bi\u00e8re en cannettes sur le march\u00e9 en Colombie-Britannique. Durant la p\u00e9riode de temps o\u00f9 se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s les faits pertinents \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire, aucun autre concurrent n\u2019a mis de la bi\u00e8re en cannettes sur le march\u00e9 dans cette province.\nVoici le t\u00e9moignage de M.B.G. Ginter, le principal actionnaire de la compagnie appelante, sur la question de savoir comment l\u2019appelante en est venue \u00e0 employer le mot \u00abPilcan\u00bb:\n[TRADUCTION] Q. Maintenant, voulez-vous dire \u00e0 M. le Juge comment vous en \u00eates venu \u00e0 vous servir de l\u2019appellation \u00abPilcan\u00bb sur la pi\u00e8ce \u00abA\u00bb?\nR. Eh bien, nous avons d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 sur le nom que nous allions adopter pour la mise en march\u00e9 de la bi\u00e8re en cannettes, puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une innovation dans l\u2019Ouest canadien. Maintenant, on en trouve \u00e9galement au Manitoba. Mais \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, ce n\u2019\u00e9tait connu d\u2019aucun fabricant; aussi j\u2019ai insist\u00e9 sur l\u2019importance de faire comprendre qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une bi\u00e8re l\u00e9g\u00e8re comme le ma\u00eetre-brasseur M. Zarek me l\u2019avait souvent r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9: en lan\u00e7ant une bi\u00e8re qu\u2019aucun autre brasseur ne fabrique ni ne conna\u00eet il faut d\u2019abord mettre sur le march\u00e9 une bi\u00e8re l\u00e9g\u00e8re; ensuite pour bien faire ressortir le fait qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une bi\u00e8re l\u00e9g\u00e8re et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en cannettes, nous en sommes arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appellation \u00abPilcan\u00bb.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e ne pr\u00e9tend pas que le mot \u00abPil\u00bb ait eu, dans son sens premier, quelque rapport que ce soit avec son produit. La preuve d\u00e9montre que le mot \u00abPil\u00bb \u00e9tait plus ou moins un diminutif pour la bi\u00e8re Pilsener aussi bien en Colombie-Britannique qu\u2019ailleurs, et cela bien avant 1963. La preuve ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le pas que le mot \u00abPil\u00bb ait pris un sens secondaire et le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019est pas non plus arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 cette conclusion.\nLe Juge Gibson a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que:\n[TRADUCTION] Il faut donc conclure que, vers le milieu de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1966, la d\u00e9fenderesse avait l\u2019intention, ce qu\u2019elle a fait, d\u2019appeler l\u2019attention du public sur ses marchandises qui sont en cause dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire par l\u2019utilisation du mot \u00abPil\u2019Can\u00bb et la pr\u00e9sentation de l\u2019emballage de ses cannettes de bi\u00e8re Pilsener de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 causer ou \u00e0 vraisemblablement causer de la confusion en Colombie\u2011Britannique au sens de l\u2019art. 7(b) de la Loi sur les marques de commerce entre la bi\u00e8re Pilsener dite \u00abPilcan\u00bb de la d\u00e9fenderesse (Tartan) et la bi\u00e8re Pilsener dite \u00abPil\u00bb de la demanderesse (Carling).\nPour en arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, le savant Juge a \u00e9t\u00e9 grandement influenc\u00e9 par la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019en plus de lancer sur le march\u00e9 de la bi\u00e8re Pilsener sous l\u2019\u00e9tiquette \u00abPilcan\u00bb l\u2019appelante vend \u00e9galement des bi\u00e8res qu\u2019elle appelle \u00abHigh Life\u00bb, \u00abPaabs\u00bb et \u00abBudd\u00bb. Voici ce que dit le savant Juge \u00e0 ce sujet: [TRADUCTION] Il est clair que le choix qu\u2019on a fait des trois derni\u00e8res appellations visait \u00e0 appeler l\u2019attention du public de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 causer ou \u00e0 vraisemblablement causer de la confusion entre ces bi\u00e8res produites par la d\u00e9fenderesse et des marques bien connues de bi\u00e8re am\u00e9ricaine, marques qui seraient connues des consommateurs de la Colombie-Britannique.\nJ\u2019ai des doutes quant \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de cette preuve. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, il n\u2019y a pas eu de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019appelante se sert de ces appellations sans permis et la conclusion qu\u2019a tir\u00e9e le Juge Gibson de cette preuve \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019appelante a command\u00e9 son jugement quant \u00e0 l\u2019intention de l\u2019appelante en rapport avec l\u2019emploi du mot \u00abPilcan\u00bb.\nA mon avis, il faut d\u00e9cider de la pr\u00e9sente affaire en comparant les \u00e9tiquettes et les emballages dont se servent l\u2019appelante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e respectivement et qu\u2019on pr\u00e9tend se ressembler au point de causer ou de vraisemblablement causer de la confusion.\nLes \u00e9tiquettes et emballages figurent hors-texte.\nJe ne vois pas comment on peut dire qu\u2019un acheteur de bi\u00e8re Pilsener pourrait \u00eatre tromp\u00e9, induit en erreur ou embrouill\u00e9 au point de prendre la bi\u00e8re de l\u2019appelante dite \u00abPilcan\u00bb pour celle dite \u00abPil\u00bb de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il n\u2019y a tout simplement pas de ressemblance appr\u00e9ciable dans les \u00e9tiquettes et les emballages qui puisse probablement ou vraisemblablement causer de la confusion.

En cons\u00e9quence, je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi \u00e0 notre Cour, avec d\u00e9pens.\nLE JUGE SPENCE\u2014J\u2019ai eu le privil\u00e8ge de lire les motifs de mon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Martland et je partage son avis que le pourvoi devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nIl me semble que la question cruciale \u00e0 trancher est de savoir si, le 8 septembre 1958, l\u2019intim\u00e9 Burnie a fait valoir aux appelants, ou plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 deux d\u2019entre eux, Sidney Young et Jacob Zalkowitz, que lui, Burnie, d\u00e9tenait \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, pour le compte de la Banque, \u00e0 son bureau, dans son classeur, un acte de cession de la police d\u2019assurance sur la vie du Dr Caldwell, qui serait aussit\u00f4t affect\u00e9e \u00e0 la garantie du remboursement du pr\u00eat qui serait consenti au Dr Caldwell. S\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 que Burnie a fait cette d\u00e9claration, il m\u2019aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s difficile de ne pas conclure que la Banque \u00e9tait li\u00e9e par l\u2019acte de son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9, agissant alors, \u00e0 mon avis, dans les limites de ses attributions. Il y a lieu de se rappeler que la Banque, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de Burnie, avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00eat\u00e9 $15,000 au Dr Caldwell, bien que Burnie ait admis ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00eater plus de $10,000, et que ce dernier avait non seulement conseill\u00e9 \u00e0 Young et \u00e0 Jacob Zalkowitz de pr\u00eater de l\u2019argent au Dr Caldwell, mais encore il leur avait propos\u00e9 de faire en sorte que la Banque, dont il \u00e9tait le g\u00e9rant, leur avance des fonds pour leur permettre de les pr\u00eater \u00e0 leur tour au Dr Caldwell. C\u2019est s\u00fbrement le travail d\u2019un g\u00e9rant que d\u2019augmenter le chiffre d\u2019affaires de la Banque en consentant des pr\u00eats. Bien entendu, pour ce qui est de Jonas Zalkowitz, le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant de l\u2019entente entre Burnie, Young et son fr\u00e8re Jacob et avait agi seulement pour obliger ce dernier. Par cons\u00e9quent, il ne pouvait invoquer aucune d\u00e9claration qu\u2019aurait pu faire Burnie.\nToutefois, le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a accept\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de Burnie selon lequel \u00abil a convenu que la police d\u2019assurance allait \u00eatre c\u00e9d\u00e9e \u00e0 Zalkowitz (i.e. Jacob Zalkowitz) et Young, sous r\u00e9serve des droits de la Banque\u00bb. (Les italiques sont de moi.) Le Juge d\u2019appel Robertson, dans ses motifs de jugement, sur lesquels tous les membres de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019accord, dit apr\u00e8s une minutieuse analyse de la preuve:\n[TRADUCTION] Je conclus de la preuve que ni Young, ni Jacob Zalkowitz, ni Burnie, ni l\u2019ensemble de leurs t\u00e9moignages ne d\u00e9montre que Burnie ait fait valoir aux appelants, au terme de la r\u00e9union du 8 septembre 1958, que la police d\u2019assurance \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenue pour leur protection. Je suis d\u2019avis que le plaidoyer de l\u2019avocat des appelants, quoique tr\u00e8s habile, ne parvient pas \u00e0 infirmer ces conclusions concordantes. Par ailleurs, tout comme le Juge d\u2019appel Robertson, je consid\u00e8re que les trois circonstances suivantes corroborent solidement cette conclusion. Premi\u00e8rement, le fait que Burnie ait amen\u00e9 Caldwell \u00e0 lui remettre, le 18 septembre, deux ch\u00e8ques de $25,000 chacun laissant en blanc dans tous les cas le nom du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, tir\u00e9s sur son compte \u00e0 la succursale de la Banque dont Burnie \u00e9tait le g\u00e9rant, et un billet du m\u00eame montant \u00e9galement sign\u00e9 par Caldwell, ainsi que le t\u00e9moignage de Burnie \u00e0 l\u2019effet que ces pi\u00e8ces \u00e9taient destin\u00e9es \u00e0 permettre de faire servir la police d\u2019assurance \u00e0 garantir les cr\u00e9ances de Young, de Zalkowitz et des Hudson, constituent la preuve la plus \u00e9vidente que Burnie, dix jours apr\u00e8s avoir fait sa d\u00e9claration, tentait de cr\u00e9er une situation qui la rendrait valable, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, que la police serait c\u00e9d\u00e9e aux appelants. Deuxi\u00e8mement, en 1962, Burnie a tent\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir de la part de Mme Caldwell, la b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d\u00e9sign\u00e9e, et des docteurs Kepkay et Gillis, les \u00abpropri\u00e9taires\u00bb de la police, une cession totale de celle-ci en faveur des appelants, mais il en a \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9 par leur refus de signer l\u2019acte de cession. L\u00e0 encore, Burnie a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019effor\u00e7ait de rendre valable sa d\u00e9claration que la police serait c\u00e9d\u00e9e. Troisi\u00e8mement, l\u2019all\u00e9gation des appelants au paragraphe 8(j) de leur d\u00e9fense amend\u00e9e est exactement au m\u00eame effet, savoir ce qui devait se faire par la suite.\nPour ces motifs, je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi, avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs des appelants: Russell & Du Moulin, Vancouver.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, La Banque de Montr\u00e9al: Campney, Owen & Murphy, Vancouver.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9, Archibald Robert Burnie: Freeman, Freeman, Silvers & Koffman, Vancouver.",

Dans ces annonces, on lit que\n\u2026les prix seront attribu\u00e9s apr\u00e8s qu\u2019ils (les candidats) auront r\u00e9pondu correctement, en public, \u00e0 quelques unes des questions correspondant aux r\u00e9ponses imprim\u00e9es au verso du re\u00e7u officiel.\nAu verso de ce re\u00e7u, destin\u00e9 au contribuable sur paiement de ce qu\u2019on appelle la taxe volontaire, sont imprim\u00e9es vingt r\u00e9ponses dont les suivantes sont typiques:\n1. Montr\u00e9al a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e en 1642.\n3. Montr\u00e9al est la M\u00e9tropole du Canada.\n5. Le grand fleuve qui relie Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 l\u2019Oc\u00e9an Atlantique s\u2019appelle le Saint-Laurent.\n9. La montagne situ\u00e9e dans les limites de la ville de Montr\u00e9al s\u2019appelle le Mont-Royal.\nDans l\u2019annonce publi\u00e9e dans le journal La Presse, on lit:\nSi un enfant est trop jeune pour r\u00e9pondre aux questions, son p\u00e8re ou sa m\u00e8re ou la personne qui a pay\u00e9 au nom de l\u2019enfant pourra r\u00e9pondre pour lui. Bien qu\u2019il soit pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution du Comit\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutif que\nTous les prix seront physiquement sous forme de lingots d\u2019argent d\u2019une valeur au moins \u00e9gale aux prix annonc\u00e9s.\ndans la m\u00eame annonce, la description des prix est comme suit:\n1er PRIX\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n$100,000 EN ARGENT\nEN PLUS:\n30 prix de\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n$1,000 chacun en argent\n20 prix de\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n$ 500 chacun en argent\n100 prix de\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\n$ 100 chacun en argent\nApr\u00e8s avoir entendu les avocats d\u00e9sign\u00e9s par le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la province et par la Ville de Montr\u00e9al, la Cour d\u2019appel, form\u00e9e de M. le juge en chef Tremblay et de MM. les juges Casey, Rinfret, Taschereau et Owen, prit l\u2019affaire en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et se pronon\u00e7a ult\u00e9rieurement comme suit sur la question pos\u00e9e: Trois des membres de la Cour, MM. les juges Casey, Taschereau et Owen, donn\u00e8rent une r\u00e9ponse affirmative au motif que l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du plan propos\u00e9 contreviendrait, suivant les deux premiers, aux dispositions des paragraphes (1)(d) et (1)(e) de l\u2019art. 179 du Code criminel et, suivant le troisi\u00e8me, aux dispositions du paragraphe (1)(d) de cet article. Dissidents, M. le Juge en chef et M. le juge Rinfret donn\u00e8rent une r\u00e9ponse n\u00e9gative. M. le Juge en chef indiqua, toutefois, qu\u2019il aurait r\u00e9pondu affirmativement \u00absi l\u2019on pose seulement (aux personnes appel\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019examen) les questions auxquelles on peut r\u00e9pondre par les phrases apparaissant \u00e0 l\u2019endos du re\u00e7u \u00e9mis par la Ville\u00bb.\nDans les notes donn\u00e9es au soutien de son opinion, \u00e0 laquelle M. le juge Taschereau donne son accord, M. le juge Casey d\u00e9clare, en r\u00e9sum\u00e9, qu\u2019il ressort clairement des annonces publi\u00e9es dans les journaux que l\u2019intention de la Ville, en ce qui concerne l\u2019examen auquel doivent se pr\u00e9senter certains contribuables de cette pr\u00e9tendue taxe volontaire, est de rendre cet examen aussi facile et peu laborieux que possible et qu\u2019en v\u00e9rit\u00e9, ce que la Ville a dit implicitement sinon express\u00e9ment au public, c\u2019est que les \u00e9nonc\u00e9s de fait imprim\u00e9s au verso du re\u00e7u officiel sont les r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 donner aux questions qui seront pos\u00e9es. De l\u2019avis du savant juge, l\u2019aptitude \u00e0 apprendre par c\u0153ur ces simples \u00e9nonc\u00e9s de fait, pour les r\u00e9p\u00e9ter ensuite en public, ne saurait, tout au plus, constituer qu\u2019un degr\u00e9 d\u2019habilet\u00e9 minime incapable en regard des crit\u00e8res jurisprudentiels de contenir le plan dans les limites de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9, comme on a pr\u00e9tendu y parvenir en introduisant ce type d\u2019examen dans la derni\u00e8re phase d\u2019une op\u00e9ration qui tient essentiellement du hasard.\nM. le juge Casey ajoute qu\u2019il est convaincu que les prix offerts au public par les annonces dans les journaux sont des prix en esp\u00e8ces et que la disposition pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e de la r\u00e9solution du Comit\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutif, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la forme de ces prix, repr\u00e9sente un autre moyen visant \u00e0 soustraire le plan aux dispositions de la loi.\nEn tout respect pour l\u2019opinion contraire, je dois dire que nous sommes tous d\u2019accord avec les motifs et conclusions \u00e9nonc\u00e9s aux notes de M. le juge Casey, motifs et conclusions que nous adoptons int\u00e9gralement et auxquels nous ne voyons rien qui pourrait \u00eatre utilement ajout\u00e9.\nDans ces vues, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de poursuivre davantage la consid\u00e9ration de la question soumise par le renvoi. Il s\u2019ensuit que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nAppel rejet\u00e9.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelante: M. C\u00f4t\u00e9 & A. Lamer, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9: C.

Le terrain \u00e9tait vacant, les services publics n\u2019y \u00e9taient pas install\u00e9s, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas cultiv\u00e9 et \u00e9tait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement plat. On n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il existait une demande courante pour un tel emplacement. Les deux t\u00e9moins de l\u2019appelant ont \u00e9valu\u00e9 la valeur marchande \u00e0 $67,500 et $54,000 respectivement et le t\u00e9moin de la Commission \u00e0 $27,000. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019a choisi ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre de ces \u00e9valuations.

L\u2019appelant r\u00e9clame une indemnit\u00e9 de $54,000.\nDe consentement mutuel, les parties ont convenu que la seule question que le proc\u00e8s devait r\u00e9soudre \u00e9tait celle de la valeur marchande du terrain au moment de l\u2019expropriation.\nLe terrain expropri\u00e9 se trouve dans le canton Nepean, \u00e0 l\u2019ouest du village de Bell\u2019s Corners et au sud de la route n\u00b0 15, qui va d\u2019Ottawa \u00e0 Carleton Place. Il a une superficie de 13.5 acres et 350 pieds de largeur sur la route. Sa ligne arri\u00e8re mesure 600 pieds et longe la ligne de chemin de fer du Pacifique-Canadien. Au moment de l\u2019expropriation le terrain \u00e9tait vacant, les services publics n\u2019y \u00e9taient pas install\u00e9s et il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas cultiv\u00e9. Ce terrain \u00e9tait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement plat et de niveau avec la route. Il comportait un droit de passage dans un chemin \u00e0 sa limite ouest. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait assujetti \u00e0 aucun r\u00e8glement de zonage, mais le r\u00e8glement r\u00e9gissant les subdivisions adopt\u00e9 par le canton Nepean y \u00e9tait applicable.\nL\u2019appelant s\u2019\u00e9tait port\u00e9 acqu\u00e9reur de ce terrain le 9 novembre 1956, au prix de $8,000, soit environ $593 l\u2019acre.\nLa Commission a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 cette expropriation pour les fins de la ceinture de verdure de la Capitale nationale, dont la nature a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une \u00e9tude dans l\u2019affaire National Capital Commission c. Munro[3]. La ceinture de verdure occupe une superficie d\u2019environ 17,000 acres dans le canton Nepean. De cette superficie totale, la Commission en a acquis \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 14,000 acres de gr\u00e9 \u00e0 gr\u00e9 et environ 3,000 acres par voie d\u2019expropriation, soit 1,400 acres en 1959 et 1,600 acres en 1961. Trois personnes ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour donner leur opinion sur la valeur marchande du terrain dont il est question ici; MM. Whelan et Young pour le compte de l\u2019appelant et M. Crawford pour le compte de la Commission. Leurs \u00e9valuations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les suivantes:\nM. Whelan:\n$67,500\n($5,000 l\u2019acre)\nM. Young:\n54,000\n( 4,000 \u201c )\nM. Crawford:\n27,000\n( 2,000 \u201c )\nLe savant Pr\u00e9sident de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier n\u2019a choisi ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre de ces \u00e9valuations, comme on peut le voir dans le passage suivant, extrait des motifs de son jugement:\n[TRADUCTION] Les trois t\u00e9moins, apr\u00e8s avoir mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019ils avaient \u00e9tudi\u00e9 certaines questions (qui sont, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, des questions pertinentes) ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 en \u00eatre arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 fixer la valeur marchande du terrain en question au moment de l\u2019expropriation. Mais si, pour juger de ces opinions, on essaie de trouver comment les t\u00e9moins ont pes\u00e9 chacun des crit\u00e8res dont ils ont dit s\u2019\u00eatre servis pour en arriver \u00e0 un chiffre d\u00e9finitif, ou pourquoi ils ont \u00e9cart\u00e9 certains facteurs qu\u2019ils consid\u00e9raient sans importance dans la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9, on ne retrouve pas lesdits renseignements pour plusieurs de ces crit\u00e8res et on constate que les motifs qui ont fait \u00e9carter certains autres crit\u00e8res semblent manquer de poids. Il s\u2019ensuit que je devrai me faire une opinion moi-m\u00eame, en utilisant au mieux les renseignements et les crit\u00e8res que les t\u00e9moins et les avocats en cette cause m\u2019ont procur\u00e9s.\nCe que je dois faire, comme je le comprends, c\u2019est me mettre \u00e0 la place d\u2019un individu qui aurait poss\u00e9d\u00e9 le terrain expropri\u00e9 juste avant l\u2019expropriation, qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00eat \u00e0 vendre, mais qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9 de le faire, qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de juger tous les facteurs qu\u2019une personne raisonnablement prudente et exp\u00e9riment\u00e9e consid\u00e9rerait dans un tel cas, et me demander quel prix aurait exig\u00e9 ce propri\u00e9taire pour s\u2019en d\u00e9partir. Je dois aussi me mettre \u00e0 la place d\u2019un acheteur \u00e9ventuel d\u2019une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pareille au terrain expropri\u00e9 juste avant l\u2019expropriation, qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas forc\u00e9 de l\u2019acqu\u00e9rir, et qui serait en mesure de juger tous les facteurs qu\u2019une personne raisonnablement prudente et exp\u00e9riment\u00e9e consid\u00e9rerait dans un tel cas, et me demander quel prix maximum un tel acheteur aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00eat \u00e0 payer pour acheter une telle propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nPour fixer la valeur marchande qu\u2019ils ont donn\u00e9e au terrain, il est clair que les t\u00e9moins de l\u2019appelant, MM. Whelan et Young, quand il s\u2019est agi de se guider d\u2019apr\u00e8s les ventes d\u2019autres terrains dans le m\u00eame secteur, ont pris comme principal point de comparaison une vente par Lobel \u00e0 Hodgins Lumber Company, survenue en avril 1961. Le terrain vis\u00e9 par cette vente se trouvait dans le village de Bell\u2019s Corners, hors du secteur de la ceinture de verdure. Dans le passage qui suit de ses motifs, le savant Pr\u00e9sident \u00e9tablit une comparaison entre les caract\u00e9ristiques de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et le terrain en question dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire:\n[TRADUCTION] Il semblerait n\u2019y avoir aucun doute que, dans le jugement que je peux porter \u00e0 partir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments que l\u2019on m\u2019a fournis, la vente la plus utile est celle de Lobel \u00e0 Hodgins Lumber qui est intervenue imm\u00e9diatement avant l\u2019expropriation. Les caract\u00e9ristiques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales des deux terrains sont semblables. Les deux sont born\u00e9s par la route n\u00b0 15 et la ligne de chemin de fer du Pacifique-Canadien. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 expropri\u00e9e est juste un peu plus loin d\u2019Ottawa que celle d\u2019Hodgins Lumber. Le terrain expropri\u00e9 a une superficie de 13\u00bd acres, alors que celui d\u2019Hodgins Lumber n\u2019a que 10 acres. Ce dernier terrain est plus grand en bordure de la route n\u00b0 15 que le terrain expropri\u00e9 mais les deux ont \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s la m\u00eame longueur en bordure du chemin de fer. Le terrain acquis par Hodgins Lumber ne comportait pas de droit de passage et il \u00e9tait grev\u00e9 d\u2019une servitude qui en diminuait consid\u00e9rablement l\u2019utilit\u00e9. Le terrain expropri\u00e9 \u00e9tait limit\u00e9 par un droit de passage sur une distance de plus de 1,100 pieds, mesurait 3\u00bd acres de plus et n\u2019\u00e9tait grev\u00e9 d\u2019aucune servitude, ni en faveur de l\u2019Hydro ni autrement.\nLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue \u00e0 Hodgins a co\u00fbt\u00e9 $50,000, soit $5,000 l\u2019acre. M. Whelan a fix\u00e9 la valeur marchande du terrain de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 $5,000 l\u2019acre. Le d\u00e9position de M. Young d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il s\u2019est surtout guid\u00e9 sur la vente \u00e0 Hodgins pour fixer l\u2019\u00e9valuation du terrain.\nVoici ce que dit le savant Pr\u00e9sident au sujet du t\u00e9moignage de Crawford sur la valeur documentaire de la vente \u00e0 Hodgins:\n[TRADUCTION] Il a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de la vente \u00e0 Hodgins Lumber Company, sur laquelle les deux autres t\u00e9moins ont tellement compt\u00e9. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019Hydro\u2011Ontario avait pay\u00e9 \u00e0 Hodgins la somme de $17,064 pour le terrain sujet \u00e0 la servitude en faveur de l\u2019Hydro, quelques ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s l\u2019acquisition du terrain par Hodgins pour $50,000, de sorte que ledit terrain n\u2019a co\u00fbt\u00e9 \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re qu\u2019environ $33,000. Il n\u2019y avait rien cependant qui ait permis \u00e0 Hodgins de pr\u00e9voir une telle chance quand elle a acquis le terrain en 1961. Je suis donc d\u2019avis qu\u2019il faut refuser cette mani\u00e8re de voir parce qu\u2019en \u00e9valuant une transaction comme indice du march\u00e9 au moment ou cette transaction est intervenue, il faut s\u2019en rapporter aux conditions et aux circonstances de celle-ci et non au prix de revient du terrain \u00e0 l\u2019acheteur, qui r\u00e9sulte de cette transaction ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u2019autres march\u00e9s subs\u00e9quents qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas pr\u00e9visibles en premier lieu.\nLe savant Pr\u00e9sident a examin\u00e9 avec le plus grand soin toute la preuve qu\u2019on lui avait soumise et il a vu le terrain en question. Il a ensuite tir\u00e9 certaines conclusions. L\u2019une d\u2019elles est \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019arriv\u00e9e du gouvernement sur le march\u00e9 immobilier dans le but d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir des terrains \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de la ceinture de verdure n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pr\u00e9ci\u00e9 lesdits terrains.\nLe savant Pr\u00e9sident mentionne, dans les termes suivants, qu\u2019on ne lui a pas fourni la preuve qu\u2019il existe une demande pour le genre d\u2019immeuble dont il est question ici:\n[TRADUCTION] Aucun des t\u00e9moins n\u2019a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour une id\u00e9e pr\u00e9cise de l\u2019offre et de la demande dans la r\u00e9gion d\u2019Ottawa, juste avant l\u2019expropriation, pour des terrains dont les caract\u00e9ristiques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales \u00e9taient semblables \u00e0 celles de l\u2019immeuble expropri\u00e9. On a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 Ottawa, les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s industrielles disponibles le long d\u2019une voie ferr\u00e9e en 1961 se vendaient tr\u00e8s cher. Un des t\u00e9moins a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, bien qu\u2019\u00e0 sa connaissance il n\u2019existait pas de terrain de cette nature sur la route n\u00b0 15, dans le canton Nepean, il \u00e9tait au courant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible de trouver ailleurs dans le canton Nepean des terrains d\u2019\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s la m\u00eame grandeur que l\u2019emplacement expropri\u00e9, born\u00e9s \u00e0 la fois par la route et le chemin de fer. Ces t\u00e9moignages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on incidente, \u00e0 la faveur des contre-interrogatoires.\nIl y a quelques \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, comme je viens de l\u2019indiquer, montrant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible de trouver dans le canton Nepean des emplacements semblables au terrain expropri\u00e9. Il me semble que les emplacements disponibles dans toute la r\u00e9gion d\u2019Ottawa auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 en concurrence avec ceux du canton Nepean, qu\u2019ils soient sur la route n\u00b0 15 ou ailleurs, et que certains d\u2019entre eux \u00e9taient plus en demande pour certaines fins tandis que d\u2019autres devaient \u00eatre plus recherch\u00e9s pour d\u2019autres fins. On n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli cependant si les emplacements de ce genre \u00e9taient rares ou non, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la demande. De plus, je vois qu\u2019on n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 du tout qu\u2019il existait une demande courante pour les emplacements tels que le terrain expropri\u00e9 pour satisfaire aux besoins imm\u00e9diats de l\u2019industrie, du commerce et du gouvernement, ou pour toutes autres fins. En l\u2019absence d\u2019une preuve qu\u2019il existait une telle demande, avant l\u2019expropriation, je dois conclure, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, que l\u2019acheteur \u00e9ventuel d\u2019un emplacement tel que le terrain expropri\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait un sp\u00e9culateur qui achetait dans le but de revendre quand une telle demande existerait.\nVu cette absence de preuve et eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la vente \u00e0 Hodgins, il tirait la conclusion suivante:\n[TRADUCTION] Je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019en 1961, si quelqu\u2019un avait voulu acheter une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour des fins semblables \u00e0 celles que l\u2019entreprise Hodgins Lumber voulait \u00e9tablir et non pour la ceinture de verdure, il aurait pay\u00e9 le terrain expropri\u00e9 $50,000 tout comme Hodgins Lumber l\u2019a fait pour la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019il a acquise \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Dans ces conditions, et selon le principe que j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 pos\u00e9, soit que le terrain avait la m\u00eame valeur marchande, qu\u2019une institution gouvernementale ait voulu l\u2019acheter m\u00eame pour les fins de la ceinture de verdure, ou que ce soit une entreprise commerciale ou industrielle qui ait voulu le faire pour une autre fin si la ceinture de verdure n\u2019avait pas exist\u00e9, je suis d\u2019avis que les parties se seraient entendues sur un prix d\u2019\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s $50,000. Mais comme il n\u2019y a pas de preuve que cette demande existait \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 et comme il s\u2019agit d\u2019\u00e9valuer le terrain d\u2019apr\u00e8s le potentiel qu\u2019il offrait dans ces conditions, je suis d\u2019avis que, si l\u2019on se guide sur la seule vente \u00e0 Hodgins Lumber, $30,000 est l\u2019\u00e9valuation appropri\u00e9e. Je crois que c\u2019est le prix le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 qu\u2019un sp\u00e9culateur aurait pay\u00e9 pour l\u2019acheter dans l\u2019espoir de le revendre \u00e0 un acheteur tel que Hodgins, \u00e0 condition de trouver un tel acheteur, et le prix que le propri\u00e9taire d\u00e9sireux de vendre, mais qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas forc\u00e9 de le faire, aurait accept\u00e9.\nSi je m\u2019en rapporte aux crit\u00e8res que j\u2019ai \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s en rapport avec les autres transactions, ils ne m\u2019am\u00e8nent pas \u00e0 modifier la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j\u2019en suis arriv\u00e9 en me fondant sur la vente \u00e0 Hodgins Lumber.\nIl n\u2019y a pas de question de droit en cause dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. Les avocats de l\u2019appelant ont all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la mise en \u0153uvre du projet de ceinture de verdure avait amen\u00e9 une d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation des terrains destin\u00e9s \u00e0 en faire partie et qu\u2019il ne fallait pas tenir compte de cette d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation en fixant la compensation pour l\u2019expropriation. Cependant, le savant Pr\u00e9sident a jug\u00e9 que, de fait, il n\u2019y avait pas eu de d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation. De plus, il a \u00e9valu\u00e9 le terrain dont il est question ici comme s\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait agi d\u2019un terrain similaire situ\u00e9 hors de la ceinture de verdure, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire comme celui qui a fait l\u2019objet de la vente \u00e0 Hodgins. S\u2019il a refus\u00e9 d\u2019adjuger une somme \u00e9gale au prix pay\u00e9 par Hodgins, ce n\u2019est pas parce que le terrain de l\u2019appelant se trouvait dans la ceinture de verdure et celui d\u2019Hodgins en dehors de celle-ci, mais bien parce qu\u2019il y avait absence de preuve qu\u2019il y ait eu \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 une demande imm\u00e9diate pour un tel terrain.\nIl est vrai qu\u2019il a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9valuation estimative des trois t\u00e9moins et leur opinion quant \u00e0 l\u2019effet du projet de ceinture de verdure sur la valeur des terrains, mais il \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 de le faire, \u00e9tant juge des faits. Il me semble clair qu\u2019il a bien pes\u00e9 la preuve dont il disposait et qu\u2019il en a tenu compte dans son jugement. Il en est venu \u00e0 sa propre conclusion sur la question de fait dont il avait \u00e0 d\u00e9cider, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la valeur marchande du terrain au moment de l\u2019expropriation. Sans n\u00e9cessairement approuver la m\u00e9thode qui consiste \u00e0 fixer la valeur marchande d\u2019un terrain d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce qu\u2019un sp\u00e9culateur aurait pay\u00e9 pour l\u2019obtenir, je ne d\u00e9sapprouve pas l\u2019\u00e9valuation qu\u2019il a faite celle-ci \u00e9tant, d\u2019apr\u00e8s moi, tout \u00e0 fait juste eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la preuve soumise.\nJe rejetterais le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs du d\u00e9fendeur, appelant: Gowling, MacTavish, Osborne & Henderson, Ottawa.\nProcureur de la demanderesse, intim\u00e9e: D.S.

Ensuite elle a engag\u00e9 une instance en vertu de l\u2019art. 131(1) (f) de The Assessment Act, S.R.O. 1960, c. 23, en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de taxes pay\u00e9es durant l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1960 sur la base de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de 1959, fondant sa r\u00e9clamation sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019une erreur grave ou manifeste. Cette demande de remboursement a pass\u00e9 devant la Cour de r\u00e9vision, la Cour de comt\u00e9, la Commission municipale, et la Cour d\u2019appel, et se trouve maintenant devant cette Cour. Le juge de la Cour de comt\u00e9 a accueilli l\u2019appel pour motif de sur\u00e9valuation en 1959 et a ordonn\u00e9 le remboursement \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de la partie des taxes de 1960 imputable \u00e0 la sur\u00e9valuation. La Commission municipale a infirm\u00e9, statuant que la sur\u00e9valuation ne constituait pas une erreur grave ou manifeste aux termes de l\u2019art. 131(1) (f). La Cour d\u2019appel a r\u00e9tabli le jugement du juge de la Cour de comt\u00e9.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, le Juge Judson \u00e9tant dissident.\nLes Juges Martland, Ritchie, Hall et Spence: Les art. 72 et 131 de The Assessment Act traitent de deux questions totalement diff\u00e9rentes. Le premier traite de l\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une \u00e9valuation tandis que l\u2019autre traite des demandes de d\u00e9gr\u00e8vement ou de remboursement de taxes. On ne peut pas voir comment on pourrait faire entrer en ligne de compte, dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des termes de l\u2019art. 131(1), des mots dont le sens est fonction de leur emploi dans l\u2019art. 72. L\u2019article 131 est un article de redressement qui habilite une cour de r\u00e9vision \u00e0 rendre justice au contribuable qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 surimpos\u00e9 par suite \u00abd\u2019une erreur grave ou manifeste\u00bb. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, \u00e0 en juger par la conclusion de l\u2019appel sur l\u2019\u00e9valua tion, la surcharge \u00e9tait de l\u2019ordre de 50 pour cent, et aurait s\u00fbrement \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e \u00abgrave\u00bb dans le sens de l\u2019article.\nLe Juge Judson, dissident: Il n\u2019y a aucune relation entre l\u2019art. 72 et l\u2019art. 131 et chacun d\u2019eux vise des probl\u00e8mes diff\u00e9rents. L\u2019article 72 traite de la proc\u00e9dure r\u00e9guli\u00e8re d\u2019appel. L\u2019article 131 traite de l\u2019\u00e9tat du r\u00f4le et n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec le montant de l\u2019\u00e9valuation valablement \u00e9tabli. Quand on invoque l\u2019art. 131, les taxes sont cens\u00e9es avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9lev\u00e9es d\u2019apr\u00e8s \u00able dernier r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation revis\u00e9\u00bb de l\u2019ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, (57(1) et 57(4)). A ce stade, les erreurs de sur\u00e9valuation de l\u2019\u00e9valuateur ne peuvent plus \u00eatre attaqu\u00e9es. L\u2019article s\u2019applique au redressement des erreurs de fait commises dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de l\u2019\u00e9valuation ou dans sa transposition sur le r\u00f4le.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ontario[1], accueillant un appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la Commission municipale d\u2019Ontario.

Par ce jugement, le tribunal accueillait un appel de la d\u00e9cision rendue le 10 avril 1967 par l\u2019Ontario Municipal Board. Celui-ci avait accueilli un appel du jugement rendu le 20 juin 1961, par le Juge Kinnear de la Cour de comt\u00e9 accueillant la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019art. 131(1) de The Assessment Act, S.R.O. 1960, c. 23, pour obtenir le remboursement d\u2019imp\u00f4ts qu\u2019elle avait pay\u00e9s en 1960 sur la base d\u2019un r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation \u00e9tabli en 1959. Le ville de Merritton, ainsi appel\u00e9e avant qu\u2019elle ne fasse partie de la ville de St. Catharines, a \u00e9valu\u00e9 de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re, de 1948 \u00e0 1960, les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Interlake Tissue Co. Limited et celles d\u2019autres industries \u00e9tablies dans la r\u00e9gion, a lev\u00e9 des imp\u00f4ts sur la base de ces \u00e9valuations et les a per\u00e7us. Durant cette p\u00e9riode, il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019\u00e9valuation tel que celui dont il est question ci-apr\u00e8s.\nEn 1960, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Interlake Tissue Mills Co. Limited, ci-apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9e \u00abInterlake\u00bb, a interjet\u00e9, en raison des termes de la fusion entre Merritton et St. Catharines, un appel de l\u2019\u00e9valuation effectu\u00e9e cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0, et sur la base de laquelle les taxes de 1961 devaient \u00eatre \u00e9tablies. Le 10 f\u00e9vrier 1961, Interlake a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate \u00e0 la Cour de r\u00e9vision du Comt\u00e9 de Lincoln, r\u00e9clamant le remboursement des taxes pay\u00e9es en 1960 pour le motif qu\u2019une \u00aberreur grave ou manifeste\u00bb avait \u00e9t\u00e9 commise au sens de l\u2019art. 131(1)(f) de The Assessment Act, S.R.O. 1960, c. 23. La Cour de r\u00e9vision a examin\u00e9 l\u2019appel de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de 1960, \u00e0 laquelle elle a appliqu\u00e9 certaines petites r\u00e9ductions. Apr\u00e8s quoi, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la Loi, Interlake a interjet\u00e9 appel de cette \u00e9valuation devant le Juge de la Cour de comt\u00e9. Le Juge Kinnear, par jugement rendu le 23 mai 1961, a r\u00e9duit tr\u00e8s sensiblement les \u00e9valuations, d\u00e9cidant que l\u2019\u00e9valuateur avait agi selon des principes erron\u00e9s et n\u2019avait pas respect\u00e9 les prescriptions de l\u2019art. 35 de The Assessment Act, dont le par.

(1) La Cour de r\u00e9vision peut \u00eatre saisie d\u2019une demande d\u2019annulation, de r\u00e9duction ou de remboursement des taxes pr\u00e9lev\u00e9es durant l\u2019ann\u00e9e y mentionn\u00e9e par toute personne\n* * *\n(f) qui est surcharg\u00e9e par suite d\u2019une erreur grave ou manifeste;\n* * *\nInterlake a toujours soutenu que ce paragraphe s\u2019applique exactement \u00e0 la situation dans laquelle elle se trouve, et que par l\u00e0, elle est en droit de se faire rembourser les taxes pay\u00e9es sur la base du r\u00f4le de 1959, dans la mesure o\u00f9 le jugement du savant Juge de la Cour de comt\u00e9 qui a accueilli l\u2019appel mentionn\u00e9 plus haut les a trouv\u00e9es excessives. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, l\u2019\u00e9valuateur a soutenu tout au long du litige, et en qualit\u00e9 d\u2019appelant devant cette Cour, que l\u2019article 131 (1) (f) ne vise pas du tout une situation comme celle-ci, mais qu\u2019il a trait seulement \u00e0 ce qui peut \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 d\u2019erreur d\u2019arithm\u00e9tique soit dans le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation ou dans la facture d\u2019imp\u00f4t.\nL\u2019appelant pr\u00e9tend que la voie de recours ouverte au contribuable pour faire opposition \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation est l\u2019appel pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de l\u2019art. 72 de The Assessment Act et que si le contribuable ne proc\u00e8de point conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 cet article, le r\u00f4le est homologu\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation de la municipalit\u00e9 et ne peut plus faire l\u2019objet d\u2019aucune opposition. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant souligne la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 pour une municipalit\u00e9 de savoir qu\u2019un r\u00f4le est devenu d\u00e9finitif, en vue d\u2019\u00eatre en mesure de d\u00e9terminer ses revenus pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e en cours et de pouvoir fixer ses d\u00e9penses sur la base de ces revenus (l\u2019art. 72 de The Assessment Act commence comme suit:\n[TRADUCTION] Toute personne qui se plaint d\u2019une erreur ou omission commise \u00e0 son \u00e9gard du fait que son nom a par erreur \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrit ou omis dans un r\u00f4le, ou que ses biens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sous-impos\u00e9s ou surimpos\u00e9s par l\u2019\u00e9valuateur dans le r\u00f4le\u00bc)\nIl voudrait qu\u2019\u00e0 une demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019art. 131, on applique les mots \u00aberreur\u00bb, \u00abomission\u00bb, \u00absous-impos\u00e9\u00bb, \u00absurimpos\u00e9\u00bb et \u00abdans le r\u00f4le\u00bb, qu\u2019on trouve dans l\u2019article relatif aux appels d\u2019\u00e9valuation ainsi que les d\u00e9cisions rendues \u00e0 ce sujet. Cette pr\u00e9tention me para\u00eet erronn\u00e9e en ce qu\u2019elle ne tient pas compte du fait que les art. 72 et 131 traitent de deux questions totalement diff\u00e9rentes. L\u2019article 72 traite de l\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une \u00e9valuation. L\u2019\u00e9valuation est l\u2019estimation de certains biens dans la municipalit\u00e9. L\u2019article 131 traite des demandes de d\u00e9gr\u00e8vement ou de remboursement de taxes. Les taxes sont des paiements exig\u00e9s par une municipalit\u00e9 d\u2019un contribuable. Il est vrai qu\u2019elles sont bas\u00e9es sur une \u00e9valuation, mais elles ne sont pas une \u00e9valuation: elles sont tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes d\u2019une \u00e9valuation. Je ne vois donc pas comment on pourrait faire entrer en ligne de compte, dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des termes de l\u2019art. 131(1) de The Assessment Act, des mots dont le sens est fonction de leur emploi dans l\u2019art. 72, soit quelque 60 articles dans la loi avant celui qui nous pr\u00e9occupe. En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, j\u2019adopte la description de l\u2019art. 131 de The Assessment Act que donne le Juge d\u2019appel Schroeder dans ses motifs de jugement \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel:\n[TRADUCTION] C\u2019est un article de redressement qui habilite une cour de r\u00e9vision \u00e0 rendre justice au contribuable qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 surimpos\u00e9 par suite d\u2019une \u00aberreur grave ou manifeste\u00bb ou qui a subi une perte\u00bc\nDans Re Blackburn and City of Ottawa[2], il est question du droit d\u2019appel relatif \u00e0 une demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de ce qui correspondait alors \u00e0 l\u2019art. 131. Le Juge d\u2019appel Middleton dit \u00e0 la p. 500, apr\u00e8s avoir fait l\u2019historique de la situation:\n[TRADUCTION] Plusieurs choses ressortent de cet historique de la l\u00e9gislation. Le droit d\u2019appel d\u2019une \u00e9valuation et le droit de s\u2019adresser \u00e0 la Cour de r\u00e9vision pour un d\u00e9gr\u00e8vement de taxes sont et ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 deux questions tout \u00e0 fait distinctes.\nLe Juge Kinnear de la Cour de comt\u00e9, s\u2019effor\u00e7ant de pr\u00e9ciser le v\u00e9ritable sens et le vrai but de l\u2019art. 131(1) (f) de The Assessment Act, s\u2019est livr\u00e9e \u00e0 des recherches fort p\u00e9n\u00e9trantes sur l\u2019histoire de l\u2019article. Celuici a figur\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans les Statuts du Canada de 1852-1853, 16 Vict., c. 182, art. 29. Les termes pertinents en \u00e9taient:\nqui par suite d\u2019une erreur grave et manifeste commise dans le r\u00f4le, tel que d\u00e9finitivement adopt\u00e9 par la cour, aura \u00e9t\u00e9 surcharg\u00e9e pour plus de vingt-cinq pour cent\u00bc\nIl n\u2019y a eu aucune modification du texte jusqu\u2019en 1904, quand, par la Loi 4 Edouard VII, c. 23, art. 112, de la province d\u2019Ontario, \u00e9videmment, les termes en ont \u00e9t\u00e9 revis\u00e9s par la suppression, premi\u00e8rement des mots \u00abtel que d\u00e9finitivement adopt\u00e9 par la cour\u00bb et deuxi\u00e8mement des mots \u00abde plus de vingt-cinq pour cent sur la somme pour laquelle elle aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre cotis\u00e9e\u00bb. La partie pertinente de l\u2019article se lisait d\u00e8s lors comme suit:\n[TRADUCTION] qui, par suite d\u2019une erreur grave et manifeste commise dans le r\u00f4le, aura \u00e9t\u00e9 surcharg\u00e9e\u00bc Ces termes sont rest\u00e9s de nouveau sans modification durant dix-huit ans. En 1922, par la Loi 12-13 Geo. V, c. 78, art. 26, une modification importante a \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9e par laquelle le mot \u00abet\u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9 par le mot \u00abou\u00bb, ce qui donnait:\n[TRADUCTION] qui, par suite d\u2019une erreur grave ou manifeste commise dans le r\u00f4le, aura \u00e9t\u00e9 surcharg\u00e9e.\nSept ans plus tard, en 1929, la Loi 19 Geo. V, c. 63, art. 7, a ajout\u00e9 le mot \u00abd\u2019\u00e9valuation\u00bb de sorte que la partie pertinente de l\u2019article se lisait:\n[TRADUCTION] qui, par suite d\u2019une erreur grave ou manifeste commise dans le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, aura \u00e9t\u00e9 surcharg\u00e9e\u00bc\nLa derni\u00e8re modification a \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9e en 1944, par 8 Geo. V, c. 7, art. 15, en supprimant les mots \u00abcommise dans le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation\u00bb, de sorte que depuis lors et pr\u00e9sentement l\u2019article se lit comme suit:\n[TRADUCTION] qui est surcharg\u00e9e par suite d\u2019une erreur grave ou manifeste\u00bc\nA mon avis, cet expos\u00e9 des modifications apport\u00e9es au cours des ans d\u00e9montre nettement l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur d\u2019accorder une protection au contribuable, et que l\u2019\u00e9tendue de cette protection a \u00e9t\u00e9 sans cesse \u00e9largie pour en arriver au texte actuel. Tout d\u2019abord, le terme \u00abgrave\u00bb \u00e9tait limit\u00e9 par la disposition portant que la surcharge devait atteindre vingt-cinq pour cent, ce qui est une indication manifeste que le mot \u00abgrave\u00bb tel qu\u2019employ\u00e9 ici se rattache au montant de la surcharge. Deuxi\u00e8mement, en 1922, les mots \u00abgrave et manifeste\u00bb ont \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9s en \u00abgrave ou manifeste\u00bb. Le mot \u00abou\u00bb est une conjonction d\u2019opposition qui implique une alternative, alors que le mot \u00abet\u00bb, au contraire, est une conjonction d\u2019union qui exige que l\u2019erreur, pour justifier la r\u00e9paration, soit en m\u00eame temps grave et manifeste. Apr\u00e8s la modification, je suis donc d\u2019accord avec le Juge de la Cour de comt\u00e9 quand elle dit dans ses motifs:\n[TRADUCTION] D\u2019apr\u00e8s le texte actuel de l\u2019article, l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas tenu de prouver que l\u2019erreur est manifeste dans le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation, le texte \u00e9tant maintenant simplement [TRADUCTION] \u00abqui est surcharg\u00e9e par suite d\u2019une erreur grave ou manifeste\u00bb\n* * *\net\n[TRADUCTION] Tout ce que l\u2019appelant a besoin de faire, en cons\u00e9quence, c\u2019est de montrer que l\u2019erreur est \u00abgrave\u00bb.\nIl n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de s\u2019appuyer sur des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents pour dire qu\u2019une loi doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 donner aux mots la signification qu\u2019ils ont d\u2019ordinaire, \u00e0 moins que le contexte n\u2019impose un autre sens. Le Shorter Oxford Dictionary donne plusieurs sens \u00e0 l\u2019adjectif \u00abgrave\u00bb, dont \u00abthick, stout, massive, big\u00bb sont les premiers et les plus courants je crois. Au d\u00e9but, le l\u00e9gislateur pensait que la surcharge devait \u00eatre \u00ablourde\u00bb \u00e0 concurrence de vingt-cinq pour cent. Puis il a modifi\u00e9 son point de vue, et par la suppression des mots pr\u00e9cisant le pourcentage, il a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019une sucharge qui n\u2019atteint pas vingt-cinq pour cent peut cependant \u00eatre \u00abgrave\u00bb et donner au contribuable droit \u00e0 un redressement. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, \u00e0 en juger par la conclusion de l\u2019appel sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation, la surcharge \u00e9tait de l\u2019ordre de cinquante pour cent, et aurait s\u00fbrement \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e \u00abgrave\u00bb m\u00eame en vertu de l\u2019ancien article.\nPour ces motifs, j\u2019adopte, en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, l\u2019opinion du Juge d\u2019appel Schroeder telle que formul\u00e9e dans ses motifs \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ontario:\n[TRADUCTION] A notre avis, la Commission a donn\u00e9 une interpr\u00e9tation bien trop \u00e9troite \u00e0 l\u2019art. 131(1) (f), et nous pr\u00e9f\u00e9rons de beaucoup le raisonnement du savant Juge de la Cour de comt\u00e9, avec qui nous sommes d\u2019accord sur l\u2019essentiel.\nJe suis \u00e9galement d\u2019accord sur l\u2019essentiel \u00e0 ce sujet, et d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi, avec d\u00e9pens.\nLE JUGE JUDSON (dissident)\u2014Dans cette affaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9e Interlake Tissue Mills Co. Limited r\u00e9clame un remboursement de taxes pay\u00e9es en 1960 sur la base de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de 1959. \u00c0 cette derni\u00e8re date, sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait situ\u00e9e dans la ville de Merritton, mais elle se trouve actuellement dans la ville de St. Catharines. Interlake ne s\u2019est pas pourvue en appel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de son \u00e9valuation de 1959. Le r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment homologu\u00e9 et il est devenu l\u2019assiette d\u2019imposition de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1960. Interlake a interjet\u00e9 appel au re\u00e7u de son avis d\u2019\u00e9valuation pour 1960, obtenant une tr\u00e8s importante r\u00e9duction d\u2019environ 50 pourcent. Ensuite, le 10 f\u00e9vrier 1961, elle a engag\u00e9 une instance, en vertu de l\u2019art. 131(1) (f) de The Assessment Act, en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de taxes pay\u00e9es durant l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1960 sur la base de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de 1959, fondant sa r\u00e9clamation sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019une erreur grave ou manifeste.

Le Juge de la Cour de comt\u00e9 a accueilli l\u2019appel pour motif de sur\u00e9valuation en 1959 et a ordonn\u00e9 le remboursement \u00e0 Interlake de la partie des taxes de 1960 imputable \u00e0 la sur\u00e9valuation. La Commission municipale a infirm\u00e9, statuant que la sur\u00e9valuation en question ne constituait point une erreur grave ou manifeste aux termes de l\u2019art. 131 (1)(f). La Cour d\u2019appel[3] a r\u00e9tabli le jugement du Juge de la Cour de comt\u00e9.\nLes dispositions relatives \u00e0 l\u2019appel d\u2019une \u00e9valuation que renferme The Assessment Act sont claires et ne pr\u00e9sentent aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9. Dans les d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s par la loi, un appel d\u2019une \u00e9valuation peut \u00eatre interjet\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour de r\u00e9vision, \u00e0 la Cour de comt\u00e9, \u00e0 la Commission municipale d\u2019Ontario et enfin \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel. L\u2019article 72(1) indique comme motif d\u2019appel le fait d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00absous-\u00e9valu\u00e9 ou sur\u00e9valu\u00e9\u00bb. Ce sont les termes utilis\u00e9s quand la personne vis\u00e9e par l\u2019\u00e9valuation se pourvoit en appel. Le m\u00eame droit d\u2019appel est accord\u00e9 \u00e0 toute personne qui pense qu\u2019un autre a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019une \u00ab\u00e9valuation trop faible ou trop forte\u00bb. \u00c0 mon avis, il n\u2019y a aucune diff\u00e9rence entre les termes \u00absous-\u00e9valu\u00e9 et sur\u00e9valu\u00e9\u00bb et les termes \u00ab\u00e9valuation trop faible ou trop forte\u00bb. L\u2019appel en vertu de l\u2019art. 72 est par cons\u00e9quent pr\u00e9vu dans les termes les plus larges. Il traite de ce que je viens de mentionner et de l\u2019erreur ou omission. Selon moi, quand tel est l\u2019objet de la plainte, la proc\u00e9dure indiqu\u00e9e doit \u00eatre respect\u00e9e, et une fois homologu\u00e9 par la Cour de r\u00e9vision, le r\u00f4le devient, en tout \u00e9tat de cause, le dernier r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation revis\u00e9 de la municipalit\u00e9 (art. 57(1)), sous r\u00e9serve du droit d\u2019appel en vertu de la Loi (art. 57(6)).\nDans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le contribuable ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9valu de ce droit \u00e0 l\u2019appel de l\u2019\u00e9valuation de 1959. Cependant, apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu une importante r\u00e9duction par voie d\u2019appel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019imposition de 1960, il a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 profiter de l\u2019art. 131(1) (f) pour le motif qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 sur\u00e9valu\u00e9 par suite d\u2019une \u00aberreur grave ou manifeste\u00bb.\nDe nombreux arr\u00eats, notamment Town of MacLeod c. Campbell[4], Shannon Realties Ltd. c. Ville de St. Michel[5], et North West Lumber Co. Ltd. c. Municipal District of Lockerbie No. 580[6], ont fermement \u00e9tabli le principe que, en cas de sur\u00e9valuation par l\u2019\u00e9valuateur, le contribuable doit interjeter appel suivant la proc\u00e9dure et dans le cadre des restrictions impos\u00e9es par la loi pertinente. Dans toutes ces affaires, la proc\u00e9dure et les restrictions \u00e9taient presque identiques aux prescriptions de l\u2019art. 72 de The Assessment Act. Admettre, dans le pr\u00e9sent appel, l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 131 de cette loi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une erreur subjective serait faire fi de tous les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents.\nL\u2019article 131 traite de situations sp\u00e9ciales telles que le cas de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s exon\u00e9r\u00e9es d\u2019imp\u00f4ts durant l\u2019ann\u00e9e, d\u2019immeubles d\u00e9truits par le feu et de personnes incapables de payer les taxes pour cause de maladie ou d\u2019extr\u00eame pauvret\u00e9. Il comporte \u00e9galement une disposition explicite au sujet de la personne \u00abqui est surcharg\u00e9e par suite d\u2019une erreur grave ou manifeste\u00bb.\nL\u2019article 131, compte tenu de sa place dans le cadre de la Loi, ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 des situations o\u00f9 la question \u00e0 d\u00e9battre concerne le processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation appliqu\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00e9valuateur, ou la sous-\u00e9valuation ou sur\u00e9valuation. Il s\u2019applique plut\u00f4t aux erreurs d\u2019\u00e9critures, aux permutations de chiffres, aux fautes typographiques et erreurs semblables.\n\u00abL\u2019erreur grave\u00bb sur laquelle Interlake se fonde dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, est le fait que l\u2019\u00e9valuateur s\u2019est bas\u00e9 sur un manuel r\u00e9dig\u00e9 pour usage dans le Comt\u00e9 de Lincoln (qu\u2019il a utilis\u00e9 pour \u00e9valuer toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s industrielles) plut\u00f4t que sur un manuel r\u00e9dig\u00e9 et recommand\u00e9 par le minist\u00e8re des Affaires municipales d\u2019Ontario, qui fait \u00e9tat des crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis par l\u2019art. 35 de The Assessment Act.\nAu fond, la plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le contribuable dans \u00abl\u2019appel en remboursement\u00bb consiste \u00e0 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00absurcharg\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00e9valuateur\u00bb (les termes m\u00eames de l\u2019art. 72(1)). Le propri\u00e9taire doit d\u00e9poser cette plainte dans les d\u00e9lais prescrits pour l\u2019appel devant la Cour de r\u00e9vision, et pour les appels subs\u00e9quents, si n\u00e9cessaire, dans les autres d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s. Le contribuable ne jouit pas du privil\u00e8ge de passer outre au d\u00e9lai imparti pour l\u2019appel \u00e0 la Cour de r\u00e9vision, pour ensuite revenir \u00e0 cette Cour en vertu de l\u2019art. 131.\nSi le raisonnement de la Cour d\u2019appel est juste, tout contribuable qui peut faire la preuve d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence sensible entre son \u00e9valuation et celle de l\u2019\u00e9valuateur pourrait passer outre \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure ordinaire, attendre que le r\u00f4le soit homologu\u00e9 par la Cour de r\u00e9vision et que soient pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s les imp\u00f4ts sur la base de ce r\u00f4le, pour pr\u00e9senter ensuite sa demande, au d\u00e9but de l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante, avant le 28 f\u00e9vrier.\nUne telle cons\u00e9quence ne cadre pas avec le plan d\u2019ensemble de la Loi, selon lequel la municipalit\u00e9 doit avoir, au d\u00e9but de l\u2019ann\u00e9e fiscale, un r\u00f4le homologu\u00e9 sur lequel elle puisse se baser pour effectuer le pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement de taxes. L\u2019article 131 ne fait pas double emploi, en tout ou en partie, avec les dispositions de l\u2019art. 72 sur l\u2019appel. Il n\u2019y a aucune relation entre les deux articles et chacun d\u2019eux vise des probl\u00e8mes diff\u00e9rents. Le premier traite de la proc\u00e9dure r\u00e9guli\u00e8re d\u2019appel (art. 72). Le second (art. 131) traite de l\u2019\u00e9tat du r\u00f4le et n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec le montant de l\u2019\u00e9valuation valablement \u00e9tablie. Quand on invoque l\u2019art. 131, les taxes sont cens\u00e9es avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9lev\u00e9es d\u2019apr\u00e8s \u00able dernier r\u00f4le d\u2019\u00e9valuation revis\u00e9\u00bb de l\u2019ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente (57(1), 57(4)). A ce stade, les erreurs de sur\u00e9valuation de l\u2019\u00e9valuateur ne peuvent plus \u00eatre attaqu\u00e9es. L\u2019article s\u2019applique au redressement des erreurs de fait commises dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de l\u2019\u00e9valuation ou dans sa transposition sur le r\u00f4le. Tel est le raisonnement de la Commission municipale. Ce raisonnement est \u00e9galement en parfait accord avec les motifs du Juge d\u2019appel Riddell dans Re Bayack[7], o\u00f9 l\u2019erreur invoqu\u00e9e consistait en un changement de locataire et de religion entre la pr\u00e9paration de l\u2019\u00e9valuation et celui de la revision d\u00e9finitive du r\u00f4le. On ne nous a pas cit\u00e9 une seule affaire o\u00f9 l\u2019article ait \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 une demande fond\u00e9e sur une sur\u00e9valuation. Je fais miens les motifs exprim\u00e9s par la Commission dans l\u2019alin\u00e9a suivant:\n[TRADUCTION] Il doit n\u00e9cessairement y avoir un terme quelque part, un moment o\u00f9 Ton peut dire que la valeur imposable d\u2019une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour telle ann\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e, sauf dans les seuls cas sp\u00e9ciaux o\u00f9 il y a une grave ou manifeste erreur de fait dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de l\u2019\u00e9valuation ou sa transposition sur le r\u00f4le. Cela vaut non seulement dans les cas de r\u00e9clamation de d\u00e9gr\u00e8vement sp\u00e9cial pour cause de surcharge, mais aussi pour les demandes faites par la municipalit\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019art. 132(1) quand des personnes sont sous-impos\u00e9es par suite de quelque erreur grave ou manifeste. La Commission est d\u2019avis que ce mode de redressement sp\u00e9cial a pour but de rectifier les erreurs de fait, et non les erreurs de jugement commises dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de l\u2019\u00e9valuation.\nJ\u2019accueillerais l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens dans toutes les Cours, infirmerais le jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel et r\u00e9tablirais la d\u00e9cision de la Commission municipale.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens, LE JUGE JUDSON \u00e9tant dissident.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelant: Seymour, Lampard, Nicholls & Greenspan, St. Catharines.\nProcureurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9e: Fasken & Calvin, Toronto.\n[1] [1968] 2 O.R. 589.\n[2] (1924), 55 O.L.R. 494.\n[3] [1968] 2 O.R. 589.\n[4] (1918), 57 R.C.S. 517.\n[5] (1922), 64 R.C.S. 420, [1924] A.C. 185.\n[6] [1926] R.C.S. 155.\n[7] (1929), 64 O.L.R. 14.",

L\u2019agent s\u2019approcha de la voiture de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et lui dit qu\u2019il avait un mandat d\u2019arr\u00eat contre lui. L\u2019intim\u00e9, qui avait d\u00e9marr\u00e9, acc\u00e9l\u00e9ra, mais dut freiner \u00e0 cause de la circulation. L\u2019agent arriva en courant, passa les bras par la porti\u00e8re, saisit l\u2019intim\u00e9 des deux mains par la chemise et lui dit: \u00abje vous arr\u00eate\u00bb. Mais l\u2019intim\u00e9, acc\u00e9l\u00e9rant, lui fit l\u00e2cher prise. Le jury l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable sur le chef d\u2019accusation de s\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9vad\u00e9 d\u2019une garde l\u00e9gale, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019art. 125(a) du Code criminel. La Cour d\u2019appel annula la condamnation et ordonna qu\u2019un acquittement soit prononc\u00e9. La Couronne a obtenu la permission d\u2019en appeler \u00e0 cette Cour, et la seule question qui se pose est de savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait sous garde l\u00e9gale.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre accueilli et la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9tablie, les Juges Hall et Spence \u00e9tant dissidents.\nLes Juges Fauteux, Martland, Judson, Ritchie et Pigeon: L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9, il s\u2019est \u00e9vad\u00e9 d\u2019une garde l\u00e9gale et il est coupable de l\u2019acte criminel pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019art. 125(a) du Code criminel. L\u2019arrestation consiste \u00e0 se saisir d\u2019une personne physique ou \u00e0 y toucher dans le but de la d\u00e9tenir. Un agent de police a le droit d\u2019employer la force n\u00e9cessaire pour faire une arrestation. La d\u00e9finition du mot \u00abarrestation\u00bb ne permet pas d\u2019\u00e9tablir dans l\u2019arrestation une division, qui semble nouvelle, en arrestation \u00abavec mise sous garde\u00bb et en arrestation \u00absymbolique\u00bb ou \u00aben droit strict\u00bb. Les Juges Hall et Spence, dissidents: L\u2019agent de police avait, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi, le droit et le devoir de mettre l\u2019intim\u00e9 en \u00e9tat d\u2019arrestation. En cons\u00e9quence, l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait l\u2019obligation l\u00e9gale de se soumettre \u00e0 cette arrestation. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de toucher ou de retenir la personne qu\u2019on arr\u00eate. Il faut, bien s\u00fbr, lui dire qu\u2019on l\u2019arr\u00eate. Si la personne en question r\u00e9siste ou tente de s\u2019\u00e9chapper, celui qui proc\u00e8de \u00e0 l\u2019arrestation peut, pour la retenir, employer la force n\u00e9cessaire, de fa\u00e7on raisonnable, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la nature de l\u2019infraction qui motive l\u2019arrestation. Si la personne s\u2019\u00e9chappe et n\u2019est pas r\u00e9ellement d\u00e9tenue, on ne peut la consid\u00e9rer comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 sous garde l\u00e9gale. Dans ce cas, la personne est certainement coupable en vertu de l\u2019art. 110(a) du Code criminel. L\u2019acte pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019art. 125(a) n\u2019est pas inclus dans l\u2019art. 110(a), et vice versa.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ontario[1], annulant la condamnation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et ordonnant un acquittement.

Stewart McKeown, pour l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nLe jugement des Juges Fauteux, Martland, Judson, Ritchie et Pigeon a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par\nLE JUGE JUDSON\u2014Le 23 octobre 1967, \u00e0 l\u2019issue d\u2019un proc\u00e8s par jury, l\u2019intim\u00e9, James Whitfield, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable de s\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9vad\u00e9 d\u2019une garde l\u00e9gale en violation de l\u2019art. 125(a) du Code criminel. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 une peine d\u00e9termin\u00e9e de six mois et \u00e0 une peine ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e de six mois d\u2019emprisonnement. La Cour d\u2019appel1 a accueilli l\u2019appel de Whitfield, annul\u00e9 la condamnation et ordonn\u00e9 qu\u2019un acquittement soit prononc\u00e9. Le pourvoi devant cette Cour fait suite \u00e0 l\u2019autorisation accord\u00e9e le 29 janvier 1969.\nLe principe de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel est que Whitfield ne pouvait \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable de l\u2019acte criminel vis\u00e9 par l\u2019art. 125(a) parce qu\u2019il n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet d\u2019une arrestation avec mise sous garde et qu\u2019il aurait fallu pour cela plus que ce qu\u2019elle a appel\u00e9 \u00abune arrestation symbolique\u00bb. Elle a fait une distinction entre une arrestation \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 une mise sous garde et une simple arrestation. Dans ses motifs, la Cour d\u2019appel parle \u00e0 certains endroits d\u2019une arrestation en droit strict. On y dit que le Juge aurait d\u00fb aviser le jury qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la preuve soumise il ne suffisait pas qu\u2019il y ait eu arrestation en touchant le pr\u00e9venu, mais que la Couronne devait prouver hors de tout doute raisonnable que l\u2019agent de police s\u2019\u00e9tait empar\u00e9 d\u2019un pr\u00e9venu ou l\u2019avait captur\u00e9 et que celui-ci s\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9chapp\u00e9 par la suite. A mon avis, la Cour d\u2019appel est dans l\u2019erreur en posant ces principes.\nLa v\u00e9ritable r\u00e8gle de droit est \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans 10 Halsbury, 3e \u00e9d., p. 342, comme suit:\n[TRADUCTION] 631. D\u00e9finition de l\u2019\u00abARRESTATION\u00bb. L\u2019arrestation consiste \u00e0 se saisir d\u2019une personne physique ou \u00e0 y toucher dans le but de la d\u00e9tenir. Le seul fait de lui dire qu\u2019on l\u2019arr\u00eate ne constitue pas une arrestation \u00e0 moins que celui qu\u2019on veut arr\u00eater se soumette et suive l\u2019agent que proc\u00e8de \u00e0 l\u2019arrestation. On peut faire une arrestation avec ou sans mandat.\nLa d\u00e9finition ne permet pas d\u2019\u00e9tablir dans l\u2019arrestation une division, qui semble nouvelle, en arrestation \u00abavec mise sous garde\u00bb et en arrestation \u00absymbolique\u00bb ou \u00aben droit strict\u00bb. Un pr\u00e9venu est arr\u00eat\u00e9 ou il ne l\u2019est pas. Si Whitfield a \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9, il s\u2019est \u00e9vad\u00e9 d\u2019une garde l\u00e9gale et il est coupable de l\u2019acte criminel pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019art. 125(a) du Code criminel.\nLa Court of Exchequer Chamber a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 sans r\u00e9serve le principe de droit applicable ici, dans l\u2019affaire Sandon v. Jervis and Dain[2]. Ce jugement rendu en 1858 ne posait pas un principe nouveau; il \u00e9non\u00e7ait le droit \u00e9tabli en se fondant sur de sains principes d\u2019ordre public. Le Baron en chef Pollock, les Juges Williams, Crowder, Willes et le Baron Bramwell ont tous \u00e9t\u00e9 du m\u00eame avis, savoir:\n[TRADUCTION] C\u2019est une question de droit positif que de savoir si le seul fait de toucher une personne constitue une arrestation. Il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi raisonnable d\u2019exiger qu\u2019il y ait appr\u00e9hension de la personne pour constituer une arrestation que de ne pas l\u2019exiger. C\u2019est probablement parce qu\u2019on a jug\u00e9 souhaitable d\u2019\u00e9viter toute violence inutile qu\u2019on a fix\u00e9 la loi dans l\u2019\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elle se trouve maintenant. On a donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que si le d\u00e9biteur se trouvait assez pr\u00e8s pour qu\u2019on puisse le toucher, il \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 de se soumettre. Il s\u2019agissait de pr\u00e9venir toute lutte. J\u2019ouvre une parenth\u00e8se pour dire que le droit anglais vise avant tout le maintien de la paix publique. Il ne permet \u00e0 personne de prendre possession d\u2019une chose par la violence, f\u00fbt-ce son propre bien. Cependant, quoi qu\u2019il en soit du motif, la loi c\u2019est qu\u2019il y a arrestation si l\u2019agent est assez pr\u00e8s du d\u00e9biteur pour le toucher et de fait il le touche et l\u2019informe de l\u2019existence du bref. Je comprends tr\u00e8s bien la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de cette r\u00e8gle.\nIl est vrai que cette question \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019une action intent\u00e9e par un cr\u00e9ancier saisissant contre un sh\u00e9rif pour avoir laiss\u00e9 le d\u00e9biteur saisi s\u2019\u00e9vader d\u2019une garde l\u00e9gale. Cependant, le principe de droit \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par le Baron en chef Pollock n\u2019est pas limit\u00e9 \u00e0 cette seule application. Le Baron Bramwell, tout en \u00e9tant d\u2019accord avec lui sur le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, a apport\u00e9 une r\u00e9serve au sujet de la responsabilit\u00e9 du sh\u00e9rif pour avoir laiss\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9vasion se produire. Je le cite textuellement:\n[TRADUCTION] Je suis du m\u00eame avis mais, je ne voudrais pas qu\u2019on me fasse dire que le sh\u00e9rif est responsable de l\u2019\u00e9vasion quand l\u2019agent n\u2019a pu faire plus que de toucher le d\u00e9biteur. La capture peut valoir \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du d\u00e9biteur, de sorte que celui-ci ne peut pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 mais elle peut ne pas \u00eatre suffisante pour rendre le sh\u00e9rif responsable de l\u2019\u00e9vasion\u2026 Je ne veux pas qu\u2019on pr\u00e9tende que j\u2019affirme que le sh\u00e9rif aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 responsable de l\u2019\u00e9vasion si le d\u00e9biteur avait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 s\u2019enfuir apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 simplement touch\u00e9.\nCette r\u00e9serve, que seul le Baron Bramwell voulait apporter, visait \u00e0 all\u00e9ger le sort du sh\u00e9rif qui avait \u00e0 faire face \u00e0 une poursuite pour \u00e9vasion. Elle ne modifie pas le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Les autres membres de la Cour n\u2019ont pas admis cette r\u00e9serve et dans l\u2019affaire Nicholl v. Darley[3], on l\u2019avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e et rejet\u00e9e. On y dit que la jurisprudence montre clairement que, [TRADUCTION] \u00aben droit, il y a arrestation si le d\u00e9biteur a \u00e9t\u00e9 le moindrement touch\u00e9\u00bb.\nDans Sandon v. Jervis and Dain, la Cour suivait donc une jurisprudence \u00e9tablie depuis longtemps, sur un principe qui remonte au moins aussi loin que l\u2019arr\u00eat du Juge en chef Holt dans l\u2019affaire Genner v. Sparks[4]. Cette jurisprudence qui s\u2019est maintenue depuis si longtemps ne devrait pas \u00eatre limit\u00e9e \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure maintenant p\u00e9rim\u00e9e. Les motifs de cette r\u00e8gle de droit sont aussi imp\u00e9rieux aujourd\u2019hui qu\u2019autrefois. Un agent de police a le droit d\u2019employer la force n\u00e9cessaire pour faire une arrestation. A quel genre d\u2019arrestation faudra-t-il s\u2019attendre si l\u2019on pose comme r\u00e8gle de droit que l\u2019agent de police qui, agissant en vertu d\u2019un mandat, en informe le pr\u00e9venu et l\u2019appr\u00e9hende effectivement, n\u2019a pas fait une arrestation parce que le pr\u00e9venu \u00e9tant au volant d\u2019une voiture r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 s\u2019arracher des mains de l\u2019agent?\nJe suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi et de r\u00e9tablir la d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9.\nLe jugement des Juges Hall et Spence a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par\nLE JUGE HALL (dissident)\u2014Un mandat d\u2019arr\u00eat avait \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9 contre l\u2019intim\u00e9, James Whitfield, recherch\u00e9, de m\u00eame que deux autres personnes, sous l\u2019inculpation d\u2019avoir de propos d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 endommag\u00e9 les coussins de trois si\u00e8ges dans un restaurant, environ trois semaines plus t\u00f4t. Le 10 juin 1967, il conduisait une automobile en direction de l\u2019est, \u00e0 l\u2019intersection de l\u2019avenue i St. Clair et de la rue Dufferin, en la ville de Toronto. Au m\u00eame moment, l\u2019agent Kerr, de la police de Toronto, qui savait qu\u2019un mandat d\u2019arr\u00eat avait \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9 contre Whitfield, conduisait une voiture de police en compagnie d\u2019un autre agent. A l\u2019intersection en question Kerr vit Whitfield arr\u00eat\u00e9 au feu rouge. L\u2019agent sortit de sa voiture et comme il arrivait pr\u00e8s de la porti\u00e8re de la voiture de Whitfield, celui-ci d\u00e9marra, le feu de circulation \u00e9tant pass\u00e9 au vert. Kerr, qui connaissait Whitfield, lui dit par la porti\u00e8re dont la glace \u00e9tait baiss\u00e9e: \u00abJ\u2019ai un mandat d\u2019arr\u00eat contre vous, Whitfield\u00bb, et il ajouta: \u00abArr\u00eatez votre voiture et arr\u00eatez le moteur.\u00bb Whitfield acc\u00e9l\u00e9ra, tournant \u00e0 gauche en travers de la ligne m\u00e9diane de l\u2019avenue St. Clair, mais dut freiner brusquement \u00e0 cause de la circulation en direction de l\u2019ouest. Il s\u2019engagea alors dans l\u2019intersection, Kerr ne pouvant ni crier, ni parler au pr\u00e9venu. N\u00e9anmoins, Whitfield dut encore s\u2019arr\u00eater au milieu de la rue Dufferin \u00e0 cause de la circulation. Kerr arrivant en courant chercha \u00e0 atteindre la clef de contact tandis que Whitfield avan\u00e7ait de nouveau et tournait encore \u00e0 gauche. Comme Whitfield terminait son virage pour prendre la direction du nord, \u00e0 une vitesse d\u2019environ 5 milles \u00e0 l\u2019heure, Kerr passant les bras par la porti\u00e8re le saisit des deux mains par la chemise, et lui dit: \u00abJe vous arr\u00eate\u00bb, mais Whitfield, acc\u00e9l\u00e9rant, lui fit l\u00e2cher prise. Kerr fut alors tra\u00een\u00e9 sur quelques pieds et tomba sur la chauss\u00e9e. Tandis qu\u2019il tenait Whitfield par la chemise, Kerr s\u2019\u00e9tait frapp\u00e9 le cou contre l\u2019encadrement de la porti\u00e8re et, en tombant sur la chauss\u00e9e, il se meurtrit une articulation du coude et se blessa \u00e0 la jambe droite. Par suite de ces blessures, il dut s\u2019absenter de son travail pendant trois jours. Un peu plus tard, deux autres agents arr\u00eat\u00e8rent Whitfield en un autre lieu. Le 23 octobre 1967, il fut mis en accusation sur les deux chefs suivants:\n[TRADUCTION] 1. Lesdits jur\u00e9s d\u00e9clarent de plus que le 10 juin 1967, ou vers cette date, dans la municipalit\u00e9 du Toronto m\u00e9tropolitain, dans le comt\u00e9 d\u2019York, James Edward Whitfield a, par n\u00e9gligence criminelle, caus\u00e9 des l\u00e9sions corporelles \u00e0 un nomm\u00e9 (Frederick) Kerr, en contravention au Code criminel.

Le jury l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 non coupable sur le premier chef d\u2019accusation, et coupable sur le second. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 une peine d\u00e9termin\u00e9e de six mois et \u00e0 une peine ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e de six mois d\u2019emprisonnement.\nWhitfield en appela, all\u00e9guant qu\u2019il ne pouvait \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable de l\u2019infraction vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019art. 125(a) du Code Criminel puisqu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas sous garde l\u00e9gale \u00e0 la date en question. La Cour d\u2019appel[5], compos\u00e9e du Juge en chef Gale de l\u2019Ontario et des Juges d\u2019appel Laskin et Jessup, a accueilli l\u2019appel, annul\u00e9 la condamnation et ordonn\u00e9 qu\u2019un acquittement soit prononc\u00e9 sur l\u2019accusation de s\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9vad\u00e9 d\u2019une garde l\u00e9gale.\nLa Couronne a demand\u00e9 et re\u00e7u la permission d\u2019en appeler de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel, \u00e0 la condition que la Couronne paie les d\u00e9pens de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en cette Cour, notamment les d\u00e9pens sur la requ\u00eate pour permission d\u2019en appeler, le tout sur la base de frais entre procureur et client, quel que soit le r\u00e9sultat du pourvoi.\nLa seule question qui se pose est de savoir si, dans les circonstances \u00e9nonc\u00e9es ci-dessus, Whitfield \u00e9tait sous garde l\u00e9gale \u00e0 la date en question; en effet, s\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas sous garde l\u00e9gale il ne pouvait pas s\u2019\u00e9vader d\u2019une garde l\u00e9gale, comme le d\u00e9clare l\u2019article du Code.\nLors de l\u2019audition devant cette Cour on a invoqu\u00e9 un grand nombre d\u2019affaires anciennes jug\u00e9es en Angleterre, o\u00f9 on avait \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y avait eu arrestation ou non dans des circonstances donn\u00e9es. Presque toutes les affaires cit\u00e9es par les avocats de l\u2019appelante et de l\u2019intim\u00e9 avaient trait \u00e0 la suppos\u00e9e arrestation d\u2019un d\u00e9biteur saisi en vertu d\u2019un bref de capias ad satisfaciendum, ordinairement d\u00e9sign\u00e9 sous le nom de ca. sa., bref adress\u00e9 \u00e0 un sh\u00e9rif pour lui enjoindre de prendre sous garde le d\u00e9biteur et \u00ab\u2026le bien garder afin que le sh\u00e9rif puisse l\u2019amener devant la Haute Cour de Justice pour acquitter les sommes dues au cr\u00e9ancier en vertu du jugement\u00bb (Halsbury 3e \u00e9d., vol. 16, par. 98). On utilisait souvent cette proc\u00e9dure avant qu\u2019on abolisse la contrainte par corps pour dettes, par la loi dite The Debtors Act, (1869) 32-33 Vict., c. 62, art. 4. En th\u00e9orie, on peut encore se servir du ca. sa. mais il est tomb\u00e9 en d\u00e9su\u00e9tude et on le consid\u00e8re aujourd\u2019hui comme p\u00e9rim\u00e9. (Halsbury 3e \u00e9d., vol. 16, note (g) au bas de la p. 63). Dans les affaires invoqu\u00e9es par les avocats en cette cause, l\u2019action \u00e9tait dirig\u00e9e contre le sh\u00e9rif, soit pour n\u2019avoir pas mis le d\u00e9biteur sous garde, soit pour l\u2019avoir laiss\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9chapper quand il aurait pu le mettre sous garde. Ceci se passait \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 la common law favorisait les propri\u00e9taires. Les cours avaient alors une conception fictive ou th\u00e9orique de ce qui constituait une arrestation par bref de ca. sa., comme on peut le constater dans des affaires comme la cause Nicholl v. Darley[6]. Le sh\u00e9rif qui ne d\u00e9tenait pas et ne gardait pas le d\u00e9biteur une fois qu\u2019il l\u2019avait touch\u00e9 \u00e9tait responsable envers le cr\u00e9ancier. On voit jus- qu\u2019\u00e0 quel point les tribunaux ont \u00e9largi la notion fictive d\u2019arrestation par le refus de la majorit\u00e9, dans l\u2019affaire Sandon v. Jarvis and Dain[7], d\u2019admettre la r\u00e9serve que le baron Bramwell voulait apporter dans cette cause. A mon avis, on ne peut admettre que les affaires Nicholl v. Darley et Sandon v. Jarvis and Dain posent un principe de droit applicable \u00e0 des circonstances qui se pr\u00e9sentent un si\u00e8cle apr\u00e8s que les situations auxquelles elles s\u2019appliquaient sont p\u00e9rim\u00e9es. Le pass\u00e9 ne peut revenir de si loin. Ces proc\u00e9dures p\u00e9rim\u00e9es existaient avant l\u2019organisation des forces de police telles qu\u2019on les connait maintenant et elles n\u2019ont aucun rapport avec l\u2019arrestation ou la garde d\u2019une personne inculp\u00e9e d\u2019un acte criminel.\nJe ne crois donc pas qu\u2019il faille d\u00e9cider de la pr\u00e9sente cause d\u2019apr\u00e8s les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans les affaires relatives \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention en vertu de brefs de capias ad satisfaciendum, ce bref \u00e9tant d\u00e9mod\u00e9 depuis 1869, de nature civile, et ne tenant pas compte de la doctrine de droit criminel qui exige une preuve hors de tout doute raisonnable. Il faut plut\u00f4t en d\u00e9cider d\u2019apr\u00e8s les principes applicables aux circonstances actuelles, le Parlement ayant justement l\u00e9gif\u00e9r\u00e9 sur ce point pour faire de la r\u00e9sistance \u00e0 une arrestation l\u00e9gale et de l\u2019\u00e9vasion d\u2019une garde l\u00e9gale deux actes criminels distincts.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente affaire l\u2019agent Kerr avait, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi, le droit et le devoir de mettre Whitfield en \u00e9tat d\u2019arrestation. Il n\u2019y a aucun doute quant au fait qu\u2019un mandat d\u2019arr\u00eat avait \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9 et que la tentative de Kerr d\u2019arr\u00eater Whitfield \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e l\u00e9galement. En cons\u00e9quence, Whitfield avait l\u2019obligation l\u00e9gale de se soumettre \u00e0 cette arrestation. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en reconnaissant ces devoirs et ces obligations de chacun que nous pouvons \u00e9carter l\u2019id\u00e9e que la personne arr\u00eat\u00e9e doit \u00eatre contrainte physiquement pour qu\u2019on puisse la consid\u00e9rer en \u00ab\u00e9tat d\u2019arrestation\u00bb. Je ne crois pas qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire de toucher ou de retenir la personne qu\u2019on arr\u00eate. Il faut, bien s\u00fbr, lui dire qu\u2019on l\u2019arr\u00eate. Si la personne en question r\u00e9siste ou tente de s\u2019\u00e9chapper, celui qui proc\u00e8de \u00e0 l\u2019arrestation peut, pour la retenir, employer la force n\u00e9cessaire, de fa\u00e7on raisonnable, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la nature de l\u2019infraction qui motive l\u2019arrestation. Si la personne s\u2019\u00e9chappe et n\u2019est pas r\u00e9ellement d\u00e9tenue, on ne peut la consid\u00e9rer comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 sous garde l\u00e9gale, mais cela ne signifie pas qu\u2019elle n\u2019a commis aucune infraction. Le Parlement a \u00e9dict\u00e9 des dispositions tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cises \u00e0 cet effet. Dans un tel cas, la personne est certainement coupable en vertu de l\u2019art. 110(a), qui se lit comme suit:\n110. Est coupable d\u2019un acte criminel et passible d\u2019un emprisonnement de deux ans, quiconque\n(a) volontairement entrave un fonctionnaire public ou un agent de la paix dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de son devoir ou toute personne pr\u00eatant l\u00e9galement mainforte \u00e0 un tel fonctionnaire ou agent, ou lui r\u00e9siste en pareil cas;\u2026\nLe Parlement avait \u00e0 statuer sur deux situations: (1) l\u2019arrestation ou la mise sous garde d\u2019une personne lorsque la loi l\u2019autorise; (2) la garde de cette personne apr\u00e8s son arrestation l\u00e9gale ou sa condamnation. En cr\u00e9ant deux actes criminels, le premier ayant trait \u00e0 l\u2019arrestation m\u00eame ou \u00e0 la tentative d\u2019arrestation et l\u2019autre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vasion d\u2019une garde l\u00e9gale, le Parlement a clairement reconnu que les deux situations \u00e9taient diff\u00e9rentes l\u2019une de l\u2019autre et non interchangeables et l\u2019on doit pr\u00e9sumer que le l\u00e9gislateur savait que les mots \u00abarrestation\u00bb et \u00abgarde\u00bb ne sont pas synonymes. L\u2019acte pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019art. 125(a) n\u2019est pas inclus dans l\u2019art. 110(a), et vice versa. Ce fait ressort tr\u00e8s clairement du libell\u00e9 des par. (b) et (c) de l\u2019art. 125 diff\u00e9rent de celui de l\u2019art. 110 qui, de toute \u00e9vidence, traite de l\u2019arrestation elle-m\u00eame et non de la garde qui r\u00e9sulte d\u2019une arrestation l\u00e9gale.\nEn cons\u00e9quence, je rejetterais l\u2019appel pour les motifs exprim\u00e9s plus haut. Les d\u00e9pens seront payables selon ce que pr\u00e9voit l\u2019ordonnance autorisant l\u2019appel. La Couronne devrait accuser un pr\u00e9venu de l\u2019acte criminel m\u00eame qu\u2019elle lui impute. Ce n\u2019est pas trop demander \u00e0 ceux qui sont charg\u00e9s des poursuites. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, Whitfield cherchait \u00e0 \u00e9viter l\u2019arrestation et il aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre inculp\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019art. 110(a), ce qui le rendait passible de deux ans d\u2019emprisonnement. Telle est la peine pr\u00e9vue par le Parlement pour une personne qui, comme Whitfield, au volant d\u2019une automobile, se d\u00e9gage de l\u2019agent qui veut l\u2019arr\u00eater. Elle est passible de la m\u00eame peine en vertu de l\u2019art. 110(a) qu\u2019en vertu de l\u2019art. 125. Les deux actes criminels ont la m\u00eame gravit\u00e9, mais ils sont distincts.\nAppel accueilli et d\u00e9claration de culpabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9tablie, les JUGES HALL et SPENCE \u00e9tant dissidents.\nProcureur de l\u2019appelante: Le Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Ontario, Toronto.\nProcureur de l\u2019intim\u00e9: D.R.G.

Elle a fait venir le m\u00e9decin mais dans l\u2019intervalle, comme cela s\u2019\u00e9tait produit \u00e0 d\u2019autres occasions, le trouble et l\u2019agitation du patient avaient sembl\u00e9 s\u2019apaiser. Le docteur a \u00e9mis l\u2019opinion que le malade \u00e9tait en bien meilleur \u00e9tat et qu\u2019il continuerait \u00e0 rester calme.\nApr\u00e8s la visite du docteur, T a quitt\u00e9 le patient, qui \u00e0 ce moment \u00e9tait calme et apparemment endormi, pour s\u2019accorder une pause-caf\u00e9. A son retour, quelque quinze minutes plus tard, elle a constat\u00e9 que le patient \u00e9tait descendu de son lit, qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9chapp\u00e9 par la fen\u00eatre et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tomb\u00e9 sur un toit en auvent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tage inf\u00e9rieur. Le demandeur a subi des l\u00e9sions graves et permanentes.\nLe demandeur a poursuivi l\u2019h\u00f4pital et l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re T en dommages pour n\u00e9gligence. Le proc\u00e8s a eu lieu devant un jury et l\u2019action a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. Ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la Cour d\u2019appel. Le demandeur a soutenu devant la Cour d\u2019appel et devant cette Cour que le verdict du jury est d\u00e9raisonnable et que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a, dans ses directives au jury, fait erreur sur certains points importants.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9, le Juge en Chef Cartwright et le Juge Spence \u00e9tant dissidents.\nLes Juges Martland, Judson et Ritchie: La pr\u00e9tention que le verdict du jury est contraire \u00e0 la preuve n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e et le juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur dans ses directives au jury. Comme le dit la Cour d\u2019appel, il appartenait au jury de d\u00e9terminer si la possibilit\u00e9 que le demandeur ait une rechute pendant l\u2019absence de T pour le caf\u00e9 (et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, il s\u2019inflige des blessures par un geste irrationnel) constituait un danger r\u00e9el et non une possibilit\u00e9 improbable ou tr\u00e8s \u00e9loign\u00e9e, et cette question lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise.\nPr\u00e9tendre que T a fait preuve de n\u00e9gligence en r\u00e9glant sa conduite sur une opinion que partageait le chirurgien traitant c\u2019est exiger plus que ce que doit faire une infirmi\u00e8re raisonnablement prudente et comp\u00e9tente.\nLe Juge en Chef Cartwright et le Juge Spence, dissidents: En se fondant sur la preuve, un jury agissant judiciairement pouvait rendre un verdict en faveur des d\u00e9fenderesses et, par cons\u00e9quent, le premier argument dont a fait \u00e9tat le demandeur doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9. Quant \u00e0 son deuxi\u00e8me argument, il aurait fallu indiquer aux membres du jury que la d\u00e9fenderesse T avait admis qu\u2019elle avait pr\u00e9vu le danger et il aurait alors fallu que le jury sache que, pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question de savoir si T avait \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gligente, il devait d\u00e9cider si, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 toutes les circonstances, la d\u00e9fenderesse avait agi comme l\u2019aurait fait une infirmi\u00e8re raisonnablement prudente, quand elle a pris le parti de quitter son patient pour s\u2019accorder une pause-caf\u00e9.\nLe jury n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer tous les facteurs, mais, par des directives r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es, on l\u2019a engag\u00e9 \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer des facteurs qui n\u2019avaient pas, dans les circonstances, de rapport avec la pr\u00e9sente affaire, soit la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 raisonnable du fait que le patient pouvait s\u2019infliger des blessures pendant une p\u00e9riode d\u2019\u00e9garement.\nAPPEL d\u2019un jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique[1], confirmant un jugement du Juge Aikins prononc\u00e9 apr\u00e8s un proc\u00e8s devant un jury.

Cet arr\u00eat a rejet\u00e9 un appel \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une d\u00e9cision du Juge Aikins, rendue le 26 juin 1967, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un proc\u00e8s par jury.\nAvant de consid\u00e9rer les motifs d\u2019appel il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019exposer les faits en d\u00e9tail.\nFrederick Albert Child, douanier d\u2019environ cinquante ans, a subi une tr\u00e8s grave op\u00e9ration \u00e0 l\u2019abdomen au Vancouver General Hospital le 12 mai 1964. Il semblait s\u2019en r\u00e9tablir normalement, mais le 15 mai, son \u00e9tat s\u2019\u00e9tant aggrav\u00e9, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conduit dans une chambre particuli\u00e8re et, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une consultation entre le chirurgien et les m\u00e9decins de service, l\u2019h\u00f4pital a charg\u00e9 trois infirmi\u00e8res particuli\u00e8res, se relayant toutes les huit heures, du soin de l\u2019appelant. Ces trois infirmi\u00e8res au service de l\u2019h\u00f4pital, s\u2019occupaient de M. Child, \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion de tout autre malade. Au cours de sa tr\u00e8s grave maladie, les 15, 16 et 17 mai, M. Child a \u00e9t\u00e9 plus d\u2019une fois troubl\u00e9 et agit\u00e9, selon les observations not\u00e9es \u00e0 son dossier. A diverses reprises, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 inconscient de son entourage et a eu de vives hallucinations.\nLa d\u00e9fenderesse, Charleen Tennessy, a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re particuli\u00e8re pr\u00e9pos\u00e9e au soin du demandeur le 16 mai, de 7h. du matin \u00e0 3h. de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi. Au cours de la journ\u00e9e, elle a not\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9tat grave de son patient: celui-ci avait une aiguille intraveineuse assujettie au bras et un tube Levine introduit dans l\u2019estomac par voie nasale; son pansement \u00e9tait \u00e9norme et un drain Penrose \u00e9tait plac\u00e9 dans sa plaie; de plus, il avait l\u2019abdomen d\u00e9mesur\u00e9ment gonfl\u00e9. L\u2019infirmi\u00e8re a observ\u00e9 qu\u2019un liquide d\u00e9gageant une odeur de mati\u00e8re f\u00e9cale suintait de la plaie encore ouverte. Durant la journ\u00e9e, elle a remarqu\u00e9 et not\u00e9 sur la fiche que le malade passait par des p\u00e9riodes de confusion mentale, de grand malaise et d\u2019agitation. Elle a repris son service le 17 mai, quelques minutes avant 7h. du matin, et a lu les observations inscrites par l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 de service la veille, de 11h. du soir \u00e0 7h. le lendemain matin. Elle admet y avoir lu les observations suivantes:\n11h. 30 du soir\u2014Semble fort agit\u00e9 et troubl\u00e9, en proie \u00e0 des hallucinations visuelles fr\u00e9quentes.\nMinuit\u2014Tr\u00e8s agit\u00e9.\n1h. du matin\u2014Troubl\u00e9, incoh\u00e9rent.\n5h. du matin\u2014L\u00e9g\u00e8rement troubl\u00e9, les hallucinations persistent.\n6h. 15 du matin\u2014Agit\u00e9, en proie \u00e0 de vives hallucinations, nerveux et tourment\u00e9.\nMlle Tennessy savait donc que, trois quarts d\u2019heure avant qu\u2019elle commence son service, le malade avait \u00e9t\u00e9 agit\u00e9, en proie \u00e0 de vives hallucinations, nerveux et tourment\u00e9. La premi\u00e8re observation port\u00e9e au dossier par l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re Tennessy, \u00e0 7h. le matin du 17 mai se lit ainsi: \u00abSemble plus troubl\u00e9 et agit\u00e9 ce matin.\u00bb L\u2019infirmi\u00e8re Tennessy a prodigu\u00e9 \u00e0 son patient ses soins professionnels en lui donnant un bain et en changeant ses draps et ses pansements. Toute- fois, ces soins n\u2019ont pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 calmer le malade qui, pendant que l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re s\u2019en occupait, s\u2019est brusquement redress\u00e9 sur son lit et a tent\u00e9 d\u2019en descendre. L\u2019infirmi\u00e8re l\u2019en a facilement emp\u00each\u00e9 en le recouchant tout doucement. M. Child \u00e9tait alors agit\u00e9 et troubl\u00e9 et n\u2019avait nullement conscience qu\u2019il portait pas moins de trois tubes\u2014un au bras, un autre dans le nez, et un troisi\u00e8me dans sa plaie.\nComme le 17 mai \u00e9tait un dimanche, l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re Tennessy a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ignorait si le docteur White, chirurgien, visiterait le patient ce matin-l\u00e0; elle lui a donc t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 8h.30 pour l\u2019en prier et lui communiquer ses constatations. Une autre employ\u00e9e de l\u2019h\u00f4pital a entendu cet entretien t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique. Il s\u2019agit de Mme Engel, l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re en chef de l\u2019\u00e9tage. Il est possible que ce soit \u00e0 la suite de cet entretien que Mme Engel a rendu visite \u00e0 M. Child \u00e0 8h.45 et constat\u00e9 son \u00e9tat de trouble et d\u2019agitation. Le docteur White est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital \u00e0 9h. et s\u2019est rendu directement \u00e0 la chambre de M. Child. Dans l\u2019intervalle, comme cela s\u2019\u00e9tait produit \u00e0 d\u2019autres occasions, le trouble et l\u2019agitation de M. Child avaient sembl\u00e9 s\u2019apaiser et le docteur White a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le malade lui avait paru en bien meilleur \u00e9tat, que lui avait bien confiance que le patient continuerait \u00e0 rester calme et qu\u2019il ne pensait pas que M. Child retomberait dans son \u00e9tat de confusion mentale. Il n\u2019en reste pas moins que, pendant les vingt-quatre heures pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, M. Child avait travers\u00e9 successivement des p\u00e9riodes o\u00f9 son progr\u00e8s semblait normal et durant lesquelles il \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait calme, et des p\u00e9riodes de trouble, d\u2019agitation et de vive hallucination. Une fois son examen termin\u00e9, le docteur White a quitt\u00e9 la chambre du malade et l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re Tennessy l\u2019a accompagn\u00e9 jusqu\u2019au poste de garde. A noter que c\u2019\u00e9tait la seconde fois, ce matin-l\u00e0, que l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re Tennessy quittait le malade, d\u2019abord pour t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner au docteur White, et ensuite pour l\u2019accompagner de la chambre au poste de garde. Il convient de signaler que ces deux absences ont \u00e9t\u00e9 momentan\u00e9es.\nA son retour \u00e0 la chambre, l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re Tennessy a trouv\u00e9 M. Child calme et apparem- ment endormi. Elle l\u2019a de nouveau quitt\u00e9 pour aller prendre, \u00e0 l\u2019un des \u00e9tages inf\u00e9rieurs, son habituelle tasse de caf\u00e9 du matin. Il \u00e9tait 9h.25 environ. En quittant la chambre du patient, Mlle Tennessy s\u2019est arr\u00eat\u00e9e au poste de garde et a inform\u00e9 l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re en chef suppl\u00e9ante qu\u2019elle prenait sa pause-caf\u00e9. L\u2019infirmi\u00e8re en chef suppl\u00e9ante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas Mme Engel qui \u00e9tait absente de l\u2019\u00e9tage \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. L\u2019infirmi\u00e8re Tennessy n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re en chef suppl\u00e9ante de veiller sur le malade ou de lui fournir quelque soin et il n\u2019y a aucune preuve que cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait au courant de l\u2019\u00e9tat de M. Child.\nL\u2019infirmi\u00e8re Tennessy n\u2019a quitt\u00e9 son patient que pendant quinze minutes mais \u00e0 son retour elle a trouv\u00e9 la chambre vide, la fen\u00eatre ouverte et un drap de lit attach\u00e9 au pied d\u2019un fauteuil et pendant du rebord de la fen\u00eatre. Regardant par la fen\u00eatre, elle a vu le patient sur un toit en auvent, deux \u00e9tages en contrebas. Le malade a surv\u00e9cu, mais il a subi des l\u00e9sions graves et permanentes et il semble frapp\u00e9 d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 totale permanente.\nLe demandeur, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de sa femme, en qualit\u00e9 de curateur, a poursuivi le Vancouver General Hospital et Charleen Tennessy en dommages pour n\u00e9gligence. Toutes les parties ont reconnu que la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019h\u00f4pital n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en cause du fait des m\u00e9thodes ou traitements, mais que sa responsabilit\u00e9 ne pouvait d\u00e9couler que de la n\u00e9gligence des d\u00e9fenderesses Tennessy et Mme Engel dans l\u2019exercice de leurs fonctions comme pr\u00e9pos\u00e9es de l\u2019h\u00f4pital, engageant la responsabilit\u00e9 de cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 ce titre.\nLe Juge d\u2019appel Bull qui a donn\u00e9 les motifs de jugement \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique dit ceci:\n[TRADUCTION] On n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 que l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re particuli\u00e8re, l\u2019intim\u00e9e Tennessy, \u00e9tait une pr\u00e9pos\u00e9e de l\u2019h\u00f4pital intim\u00e9 et qu\u2019en toutes circonstances pertinentes elle a agi dans le cadre de son emploi et dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions; c\u2019est aussi la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle le jury en est venu.\nLes parties l\u2019ont de nouveau admis au cours des plaidoiries devant cette Cour. Pour des raisons qui deviendront \u00e9videntes plus loin, je n\u2019ai pas \u00e0 m\u2019occuper de la situation de Mme Engel bien qu\u2019elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 elle aussi une pr\u00e9pos\u00e9e de l\u2019h\u00f4pital et ait agi, en toutes circonstances pertinentes, dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses fonctions.\nLa question de la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019h\u00f4pital \u00e0 titre de commettant a fait l\u2019objet des premi\u00e8res et troisi\u00e8me questions du savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance au jury. Vu ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, il ne m\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019en traiter davantage. La deuxi\u00e8me question que le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance a pos\u00e9e au jury, celle qui est de toute premi\u00e8re importance aux fins du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, est la suivante:\n[TRADUCTION] Q. L\u2019infirmi\u00e8re Tennessy est-elle coupable de n\u00e9gligence ayant caus\u00e9 ou contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 causer les l\u00e9sions subies par M. Child? R\u00e9pondez \u00aboui\u00bb ou \u00abnon\u00bb.\nA cette question, comme \u00e0 une question semblable, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la question n\u00b0 4 traitant d\u2019une n\u00e9gligence possible de Mme Engel, le jury a r\u00e9pondu par la n\u00e9gative. Le jury n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question des dommages. Il n\u2019est pas sans int\u00e9r\u00eat de noter que les r\u00e9ponses du jury aux questions n\u00b0 2 et n\u00b0 4 n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 unanimes, mais que, dans chaque cas, six des huit jur\u00e9s ont r\u00e9pondu par la n\u00e9gative. La loi en Colombie-Britannique prescrit que si le jury d\u00e9lib\u00e8re depuis un certain temps, ce qui s\u2019est produit dans cette affaire, le juge peut le rappeler et l\u2019informer que la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question peut \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 des trois quarts. Or, les trois quarts des huit membres dont se compose un jury sont, \u00e9videmment, six.\nL\u2019appelant a soutenu devant la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique et soutient \u00e9galement devant cette Cour que le verdict d\u00e9coule de deux erreurs principales: premi\u00e8rement, il est d\u00e9raisonnable, deuxi\u00e8mement, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a, dans ses directives au jury, fait erreur sur certains points importants. On peut disposer assez rapidement du premier de ces griefs. Comme le Juge d\u2019appel Bull l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 dans ses motifs en Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique, les principes qui doivent guider la Cour d\u2019appel lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019infirmer le verdict d\u2019un jury sont bien \u00e9tablis. Cette Cour a d\u00e9fini ces principes \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, et notamment dans l\u2019affaire Canadian National Railways c. Muller[2], o\u00f9 le Juge Duff dit \u00e0 la page 769:\n[TRADUCTION] Nous posons en principe qu\u2019il n\u2019appartient pas \u00e0 cette Cour, pas plus qu\u2019il n\u2019appartenait \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel, de reviser les conclusions du jury sur une question de fait. Ces conclusions lient le tribunal, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elles ne soient compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9raisonnables, au point de d\u00e9montrer que le jury n\u2019a pas pu agir judiciairement.\nCe principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 par le Juge en chef Duff, dans McCannell c. McLean[3]; le Juge Rinfret l\u2019invoque \u00e9galement dans Coca-Cola of Canada Ltd. c. Forbes[4], tout comme le Juge Hall dans Byron c. Williams[5].\nDans l\u2019affaire qui nous occupe, il existait des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sur lesquels le jury pouvait se fonder pour r\u00e9pondre aux questions 2 et 4 par la n\u00e9gative et, par cons\u00e9quent, rendre un verdict en faveur de la d\u00e9fenderesse en agissant judiciairement. Je n\u2019ai pas l\u2019intention d\u2019examiner cette preuve en d\u00e9tail, mais on peut citer l\u2019opinion du docteur White, formul\u00e9e \u00e0 la suite de son examen du patient \u00e0 9h. du matin, le jour de l\u2019accident, et \u00e0 laquelle j\u2019ai fait allusion, de m\u00eame que le fait que la d\u00e9fenderesse Tennessy avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 laiss\u00e9 le patient, \u00e0 deux reprises, le matin du 17 mai, et six ou huit fois, le 16 mai, pendant son service, sans aucune cons\u00e9quence f\u00e2cheuse, et aussi que le malade reposait calmement et paraissait dormir, quand elle l\u2019a quitt\u00e9 avant que la catastrophe ne se produise. On peut aussi citer le t\u00e9moignage du docteur White qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il croyait que le m\u00e9dicament prescrit au malade et administr\u00e9 jusqu\u2019au matin en question pouvait causer ces sympt\u00f4mes d\u2019agitation, et qu\u2019il en avait ordonn\u00e9 le changement. On pourrait mentionner d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, mais il suffit de dire qu\u2019en se fondant sur ceux que je viens de mentionner et les autres, un jury agissant judiciairement pouvait rendre un verdict en faveur des d\u00e9fendeurs. Par cons\u00e9quent, je n\u2019accepte pas le premier argument dont fait \u00e9tat l\u2019appelant et je n\u2019estime pas que le verdict soit d\u00e9raisonnable et doive \u00eatre annul\u00e9. Le deuxi\u00e8me argument de l\u2019appellant est beaucoup plus important et soul\u00e8ve bien plus de difficult\u00e9s. Le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance a donn\u00e9 au jury des directives tr\u00e8s longues, tr\u00e8s soigneusement con\u00e7ues et fort d\u00e9taill\u00e9es. Le jury est venu poser des questions et le juge lui a donn\u00e9 des directives additionnelles longues et minutieuses. Dans ces circonstances, on ne s\u2019attendrait pas \u00e0 trouver dans les directives une erreur assez grave pour obliger \u00e0 accueillir le pourvoi et ordonner un nouveau proc\u00e8s. Cela est particuli\u00e8rement vrai \u00e0 la lecture du point central des remarques du juge sur la n\u00e9gligence o\u00f9 il dit ceci:\n[TRADUCTION] Je vous ai expliqu\u00e9 en quoi consiste le premier \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la n\u00e9gligence, savoir l\u2019obligation d\u2019\u00eatre diligent. Je passe maintenant au second \u00e9l\u00e9ment. Toute n\u00e9gligence pr\u00e9suppose un manquement \u00e0 cette obligation d\u2019\u00eatre raisonnablement diligent dont je viens de parler. On peut manquer \u00e0 cette obligation, ainsi que je l\u2019ai dit, par une omission ou par un acte positif. Disons, pour parler encore plus simplement peut-\u00eatre, que le manquement \u00e0 l\u2019obligation peut consister \u00e0 faire, ou \u00e0 omettre de faire, ce que, dans le premier cas, une infirmi\u00e8re raisonnablement diligente n\u2019aurait pas fait ou, dans le second cas, aurait fait. Vous pouvez juger l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re Tennessy n\u00e9gligente si,\u2014et seulement si,\u2014vous \u00eates convaincus qu\u2019elle a fait une chose qu\u2019une infirmi\u00e8re usant d\u2019une diligence raisonnable n\u2019aurait pas faite dans les m\u00eames circonstances, ou qu\u2019elle a omis de faire une chose qu\u2019une infirmi\u00e8re raisonnablement diligente aurait faite en l\u2019occurrence.\nEn toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je suis tout \u00e0 fait d\u2019accord avec ces directives. Toutefois, l\u2019appelant fait valoir que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, apr\u00e8s avoir donn\u00e9 ces directives g\u00e9n\u00e9rales sur la n\u00e9gligence, a expliqu\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail comment le jury devait d\u00e9cider si, compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re avait fait une chose qu\u2019une infirmi\u00e8re raisonnablement diligente n\u2019aurait pas faite, car, lorsque le juge de premi\u00e8re instance en est venu \u00e0 ce point pr\u00e9cis, il a expliqu\u00e9 non pas une fois mais \u00e0 plusieurs reprises dans ses directives que la question \u00e9tait de savoir si l\u2019infirm\u00e8re aurait d\u00fb raisonnablement pr\u00e9voir qu\u2019il \u00e9tait dangereux de quitter le malade. Le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance dit:\n[TRADUCTION] On soutient, si je comprends bien, que Mlle Tennessy a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gligente en laissant le malade sans surveillance, parce que, si elle avait montr\u00e9 une diligence raisonnable et avait tenu compte de ce qu\u2019elle savait du malade, notamment qu\u2019il avait tent\u00e9 de quitter son lit, dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 vous jugeriez que c\u2019est ce qu\u2019il a effectivement essay\u00e9 de faire, elle aurait d\u00fb raisonnablement pr\u00e9voir qu\u2019il \u00e9tait dangereux de le laisser seul. Bref, ce qu\u2019on reproche \u00e0 Mlle Tennessy est que, dans cet ensemble de circonstances, si elle avait fait preuve de diligence raisonnable, elle aurait d\u00fb raisonnablement pr\u00e9voir qu\u2019il \u00e9tait dangereux de laisser M. Child sans surveillance.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance dit encore ceci:\n[TRADUCTION] Naturellement, si vous rendez un verdict de n\u00e9gligence contre Mlle Tennessy en vous fondant sur la preuve faite par le demandeur, telle que je l\u2019entends, savoir que si elle avait fait preuve de diligence raisonnable elle aurait pr\u00e9vu que le malade pouvait passer par une autre p\u00e9riode d\u2019\u00e9garement et que, laiss\u00e9 seul pendant une telle p\u00e9riode, il pouvait en raison de cet \u00e9garement s\u2019infliger des blessures, vous devrez, cela va de soi, appliquer la m\u00eame norme lorsqu\u2019il faudra d\u00e9cider si le dommage attribuable \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence est ou n\u2019est pas trop indirect; cette d\u00e9cision ne comportera pour vous que bien peu de difficult\u00e9s.\nEn vous donnant des directives sur la n\u00e9gligence, j\u2019ai parl\u00e9 de la preuve du demandeur qui soutient essentiellement que Mlle Tennessy aurait d\u00fb savoir, parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait raisonnablement possible de le pr\u00e9voir par suite de ce qu\u2019elle savait de l\u2019\u00e9tat du malade, que M. Child pouvait passer par une autre p\u00e9riode d\u2019\u00e9garement et que laiss\u00e9 seul pendant une telle p\u00e9riode, il pouvait se blesser, et qu\u2019elle a manqu\u00e9 de diligence raisonnable en surveillant le malade puisqu\u2019elle l\u2019a quitt\u00e9 sans s\u2019assurer que quelqu\u2019un serait \u00e0 ses c\u00f4t\u00e9s, pendant son absence, pour l\u2019emp\u00eacher de s\u2019infliger des blessures alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait seul.\nPuis, lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019est adress\u00e9 au jury la seconde fois, le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance a dit:\n[TRADUCTION] Avant de rendre un verdict de n\u00e9gligence contre Mlle Tennessy, vous devez \u00eatre convaincus qu\u2019une infirmi\u00e8re, faisant preuve de diligence raisonnable et connaissant la situation comme elle la connaissait, aurait raisonnablement pr\u00e9vu que M. Child pouvait passer par une autre p\u00e9riode d\u2019\u00e9garement et que, laiss\u00e9 seul pendant une telle p\u00e9riode, il pouvait s\u2019infliger des blessures.\nEt, quelques minutes plus tard, il a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 exactement les m\u00eames mots. Ces nouvelles directives ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es malgr\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9nergique plaidoirie du procureur de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 ne faisait l\u2019objet d\u2019aucun doute. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis que la d\u00e9fenderesse Tennessy avait pr\u00e9vu cette \u00e9ventualit\u00e9 et ce danger. L\u2019explication semble r\u00e9sider dans la r\u00e9ponse que le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance fait \u00e0 cette fa\u00e7on de raisonner quand il dit:\n[TRADUCTION] Je ne pense pas qu\u2019il faille aller aussi loin et consid\u00e9rer qu\u2019elle a dit avoir alors eu, de fait, ces deux pens\u00e9es en t\u00eate. S\u00fbrement en jetant un coup d\u2019\u0153il r\u00e9trospectif, elle a v\u00e9ritablement dit: \u00abJe conviens, \u00e0 la r\u00e9flexion, que l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des situations pouvait survenir\u00bb.\nA mon avis, il y a l\u00e0 une grave m\u00e9prise sur la port\u00e9e du t\u00e9moignage de la d\u00e9fenderesse Tennessy au cours de son contre-interrogatoire. Elle a admis plus d\u2019une fois avoir r\u00e9alis\u00e9 qu\u2019un malade comme M. Child, qui avait eu de fr\u00e9quents moments d\u2019agitation, de trouble et d\u2019\u00e9garement depuis plus de vingt-quatre heures, pouvait avoir une rechute et s\u2019infliger des blessures. Il est parfaitement vrai que la d\u00e9fenderesse Tennessy \u00e9tait d\u2019avis qu\u2019une telle chose ne se r\u00e9p\u00e9terait pas. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 tr\u00e8s ouvertement que si elle avait cru qu\u2019une telle rechute \u00e9tait probable,\u2014ce qui est diff\u00e9rent de croire qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait possible,\u2014elle serait simplement demeur\u00e9e dans la chambre et aurait pu tr\u00e8s facilement dominer une situation semblable, comme elle l\u2019avait fait une heure et quart \u00e0 peine avant de quitter la chambre. C\u2019est donc de l\u2019aveu m\u00eame de la d\u00e9fenderesse Tennessy que, non seulement une telle \u00e9ventualit\u00e9 \u00e9tait raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible, mais encore qu\u2019elle l\u2019avait pr\u00e9vue; je cite les mots m\u00eames qu\u2019elle a prononc\u00e9s:\n[TRADUCTION] J\u2019ai pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019allait pas entrer en un de ces \u00e9tats.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, je suis d\u2019accord avec la th\u00e8se de l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant, selon laquelle, eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances, les directives d\u00e9taill\u00e9es donn\u00e9es au jury sur la question de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 raisonnable n\u2019\u00e9taient ni pertinentes ni n\u00e9cessaires. Il aurait fallu indiquer aux membres du jury que la d\u00e9fenderesse Tennessy avait admis qu\u2019elle avait pr\u00e9vu le danger et il aurait alors fallu que le jury sache que, pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question n\u00b0 2, il devait d\u00e9cider si, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 toutes les circonstances, la d\u00e9fenderesse avait agi comme l\u2019aurait fait une infirmi\u00e8re raisonnablement prudente, quand elle a pris le parti de quitter son patient pour s\u2019accorder une pause-caf\u00e9. Le jury aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre informe qu\u2019il devait tenir compte de toutes les circonstances, non seulement du fait que la d\u00e9fenderesse Tennessy avait pr\u00e9vu le danger, mais aussi du fait qu\u2019elle savait que son patient \u00e9tait calme et apparemment endormi quand elle l\u2019a quitt\u00e9, qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait au courant du pronostic verbal du m\u00e9decin quelques minutes plus t\u00f4t et qu\u2019elle se souvenait des autres occasions o\u00f9 elle avait laiss\u00e9 le malade sans que rien de f\u00e2cheux ne survienne, de m\u00eame que des circonstances qui avaient accompagn\u00e9 ses fr\u00e9quents moments d\u2019\u00e9garement au cours de la nuit et la veille.\nEn outre, je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019un jury devait, pour d\u00e9cider si la d\u00e9fenderesse Tennessy s\u2019est conduite comme l\u2019aurait fait dans les m\u00eames circonstances une infirmi\u00e8re raisonnablement prudente, estimer combien il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 facile de pr\u00e9venir toute blessure cons\u00e9cutive \u00e0 une r\u00e9currence possible de l\u2019\u00e9garement, soit en demeurant elle-m\u00eame dans la chambre, soit en priant quelqu\u2019un du personnel de surveiller son patient, et consid\u00e9rer aussi s\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire ou non pour l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re de quitter la chambre du patient. Je me rends compte que le m\u00e9decin n\u2019avait pas prescrit une surveillance continuelle, mais il appartenait au jury de d\u00e9cider, m\u00eame en l\u2019absence de telles instructions, si, eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances de l\u2019instant et vu ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait produit plus t\u00f4t, une infirmi\u00e8re raisonnablement prudente aurait exerc\u00e9 une surveillance qui, sans \u00eatre continuelle, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus diligente que celle qu\u2019a exerc\u00e9e la d\u00e9fenderesse Tennessy.

Hertfordshire County Council[7], Lord Denning, p. 371.\nComme j\u2019en arrive ainsi \u00e0 la conclusion que le jury n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer ces facteurs, mais que, par des directives r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es, on l\u2019a engag\u00e9 \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer des facteurs qui n\u2019avaient pas, dans les circonstances, de rapport avec la pr\u00e9sente affaire, soit la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 raisonnable du fait que le patient pouvait s\u2019infliger des blessures pendant une p\u00e9riode d\u2019\u00e9garement, je serais d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi et d\u2019ordonner un nouveau proc\u00e8s.

Ce dernier jugement a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action en dommages de l\u2019appelant pour pr\u00e9tendre n\u00e9gligence des intim\u00e9s, l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re Tennessy et le Vancouver General Hospital.\nApr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 tr\u00e8s attentivement les plaidoiries fouill\u00e9es des avocats, je ne vois rien d\u2019utile \u00e0 ajouter aux motifs de jugement r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par le Juge d\u2019appel Bull au nom de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique \u00e9tant tout \u00e0 fait d\u2019accord avec ces motifs.\nPour les m\u00eames motifs que le Juge Bull, je suis d\u2019avis que la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019appelant que le verdict du jury est contraire \u00e0 la preuve n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e et que le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur dans ses directives au jury.\nDepuis que j\u2019ai r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, j\u2019ai eu le privil\u00e8ge de lire les motifs de mon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Spence, avec qui le Juge en chef a manifest\u00e9 son accord. Je crois donc souhaitable de m\u2019expliquer plus en detail.\nLa n\u00e9gligence que l\u2019appelant reproche \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re particuli\u00e8re Charleen Tennessy, se situe dans les circonstances suivantes: apr\u00e8s avoir pris connaissance que son patient \u00e9tait agit\u00e9 et troubl\u00e9 au moment de commencer son service, le 17 mai, l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re Tennessy a fait mander le m\u00e9decin qui le traitait. Apr\u00e8s la visite du m\u00e9decin, elle a laiss\u00e9 le patient seul pendant quinze ou vingt minutes pour aller prendre sa tasse de caf\u00e9 du matin. A son retour, elle a constat\u00e9 que le patient \u00e9tait descendu de son lit, qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9chapp\u00e9 par la fen\u00eatre et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tomb\u00e9 sur un toit en auvent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tage inf\u00e9rieur.\nPour commencer, il me semble important de noter, comme l\u2019a fait mon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Spence, que les fonctions de l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re Tennessy n\u2019exigeaient pas d\u2019elle qu\u2019elle reste constamment dans la chambre de son patient. A ce propos, voici la question qu\u2019on a pos\u00e9e au Dr White, le chirurgien traitant M. Child:\n[TRADUCTION] Q. \u2026Vous saviez qu\u2019on ne le surveillait pas constamment?\nR. Si surveiller constamment signifie qu\u2019il y avait quelqu\u2019un avec lui en tout temps, je savais qu\u2019on ne le surveillait pas constamment.\nL\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant a soutenu qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la preuve, on aurait d\u00fb laisser l\u2019affaire au jury en lui indiquant qu\u2019au moment de quitter son patient pour aller prendre un caf\u00e9, l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re savait qu\u2019il existait un danger r\u00e9el que son patient ait une autre crise et qu\u2019il se blesse. Pour en d\u00e9cider ainsi, aux dires de l\u2019appelant, la question \u00e0 poser \u00e9tait de savoir si, comme elle connaissait ce danger, l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re Tennessy avait agi en infirmi\u00e8re raisonnablement diligente et comp\u00e9tente, en quittant son patient pour son utilit\u00e9 personnelle. Voyant l\u2019affaire de cette fa\u00e7on, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant soutient que l\u2019absence de directive du savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance au jury sur ce point \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 l\u2019absence de directive sur le fondement m\u00eame de la preuve de l\u2019appelant et que la question de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 comme telle \u00e9tait secondaire compar\u00e9e \u00e0 celle du choix \u00e0 faire entre un danger connu, m\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait minime, et une utilit\u00e9 personnelle. Mon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Spence semble adopter cette th\u00e8se. En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne partage pas l\u2019opinion qu\u2019il exprime sur la connaissance qu\u2019avait Mlle Tennessy de l\u2019existence d\u2019un danger. Voici ce que dit mon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Spence \u00e0 ce sujet:\nC\u2019est donc de l\u2019aveu m\u00eame de la d\u00e9fenderesse Tennessy que, non seulement une telle \u00e9ventualit\u00e9 \u00e9tait raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible, mais encore qu\u2019elle l\u2019avait pr\u00e9vue; je cite les mots m\u00eames qu\u2019elle a prononc\u00e9s:\n[TRADUCTION] J\u2019ai pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019allait pas entrer en un de ces \u00e9tats.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, je suis d\u2019accord avec la th\u00e8se de l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant, selon laquelle, eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances, les directives d\u00e9taill\u00e9es donn\u00e9es au jury sur la question de la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 raisonnable n\u2019\u00e9taient ni pertinentes ni n\u00e9cessaires.\nPendant qu\u2019il contre-interrogeait Mlle Tennessy au sujet de son d\u00e9part de la chambre pour une pause-caf\u00e9, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant l\u2019a maintes et maintes fois invit\u00e9e \u00e0 dire si, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, elle pensait que son patient allait avoir une autre crise d\u2019\u00e9garement. Elle lui a d\u2019abord r\u00e9pondu:\n[TRADUCTION] \u00abNous essayons de ne rien pr\u00e9sumer\u00bb. Ensuite, elle a dit qu\u2019elle pouvait penser l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre. L\u2019avocat a finalement obtenu les r\u00e9ponses suivantes:\n[TRADUCTION] Q. Maintenant, connaissant ces ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents, vous, en tant qu\u2019infirmi\u00e8re dipl\u00f4m\u00e9e, en tant qu\u2019infirmi\u00e8re particuli\u00e8re, faisiez-vous votre service ou vos traitements,\u2026 pas vos traitements, mais votre service, votre service d\u2019infirmi\u00e8re, en pr\u00e9sumant qu\u2019il pouvait avoir une rechute n\u2019importe quand, ou preniez-vous soin du patient en pr\u00e9sumant qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas de rechute?\nR. J\u2019ai pr\u00e9sum\u00e9, une heure et demie plus tard, vu qu\u2019il reposait, que le m\u00e9decin lui avait rendu visite, qu\u2019il avait fait ses selles et qu\u2019il avait urin\u00e9, que j\u2019avais fait sa toilette et chang\u00e9 les draps, vu qu\u2019il semblait dormir quand je suis partie, qu\u2019il avait r\u00e9pondu aux questions du m\u00e9decin clairement, j\u2019ai pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 qu\u2019il allait \u00eatre en parfaite s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pendant que j\u2019irais prendre mon caf\u00e9.\nQ. Tr\u00e8s bien. Ainsi vous avez donc pr\u00e9sum\u00e9, en vous absentant pour la pause-caf\u00e9, que votre patient n\u2019aurait pas d\u2019autre crise de confusion mentale comme il en avait eu de plus en plus fr\u00e9quemment au cours de la nuit?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Est-ce exact? Je vois. Et si vous aviez fait votre service, prodigu\u00e9 vos soins en pr\u00e9sumant autre chose, par exemple, qu\u2019il pouvait avoir un autre acc\u00e8s de confusion mentale, vous ne seriez pas all\u00e9e prendre un caf\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, est-ce exact?\nR. Bien, si j\u2019avais pens\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pour en avoir un, je ne me serais \u00e9videmment pas absent\u00e9e pour le caf\u00e9.\nJe ne crois pas que cette r\u00e9ponse soit autre chose qu\u2019une expression d\u2019opinion de la part de Mlle Tennessy \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019elle ne croyait pas raisonnablement probable que M. Child aurait un autre acc\u00e8s d\u2019\u00e9garement et qu\u2019il s\u2019infligerait des blessures pendant qu\u2019elle serait absente. Sous ce rapport, son opinion co\u00efncide avec celle du Dr White, \u00e0 qui on a demand\u00e9:\n[TRADUCTION] M. MacKinnon: Q. Docteur, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce que vous saviez sur ce patient, plus sp\u00e9cialement d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019examen auquel vous avez proc\u00e9d\u00e9 vers 9h. le matin du 17 mai, aviez-vous une opinion, en tant que m\u00e9decin, sur ce que ferait probablement le patient si on le laissait seul pendant une quinzaine de minutes, vers 9h.25 du matin?\nR. A ce moment-l\u00e0, j\u2019\u00e9tais tout \u00e0 fait s\u00fbr qu\u2019il continuerait \u00e0 bien aller.\nLA COUR: Un instant, s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet.\nR. Vu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tellement lucide, je n\u2019ai pas cru qu\u2019il aurait un autre acc\u00e8s d\u2019\u00e9garement.\nEn contre-interrogatoire, le Dr White a donn\u00e9 les r\u00e9ponses suivantes:\n[TRADUCTION] Q. Oui. Et vous \u00e9tiez d\u2019avis qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait consid\u00e9rablement am\u00e9lior\u00e9 et que son \u00e9garement avait diminu\u00e9 tr\u00e8s rapidement?\nR. Avait disparu.\nQ. Disparu ou diminu\u00e9\u2014oh, est-ce bien cela, disparu?\nR. Oui.\nPlus t\u00f4t, pendant l\u2019interrogatoire principal, le m\u00e9decin avait dit de l\u2019\u00e9tat du patient, le 17 au matin:\n[TRADUCTION] \u00abJe trouvais qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait beaucoup am\u00e9lior\u00e9. Je pensais que tous nos ennuis \u00e9taient termin\u00e9s.\u00bb\nEn ce qui concerne la preuve du \u00abdanger r\u00e9el\u00bb, je reprends l\u2019opinion du Juge Bull de la Cour d\u2019appel lorsqu\u2019il dit:\n[TRADUCTION] Il est loin d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9vident que la preuve dont il vient d\u2019\u00eatre question indique une prise de conscience ou connaissance d\u2019un danger r\u00e9el au temps et lieu pertinents et il appartenait au jury seul d\u2019en appr\u00e9cier et d\u00e9terminer la nature et la port\u00e9e. Je suis convaincu qu\u2019il appartenait au jury de d\u00e9terminer si la possibilit\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant ait une rechute pendant l\u2019absence de l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re Tennessy pour le caf\u00e9 (et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, il s\u2019inflige des blessures par un geste irrationnel) constituait un danger r\u00e9el et non une possibilit\u00e9 improbable ou tr\u00e8s \u00e9loign\u00e9e, et que cette question lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise. Je ne trouve pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner la port\u00e9e des arr\u00eats Overseas Tankship (U.K.) Ltd. v. The Miller Steamship Co. Pty. (The Wagon Mound, No. 2)[11] et Bolton v. Stone[12] parce que, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, je suis convaincu que M. le Juge Bull a bien \u00e9nonc\u00e9 le droit applicable aux circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\nJe pense qu\u2019il y a lieu de souligner que la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 de Mlle Tennessy doit se juger \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des circonstances juste au moment o\u00f9 celle-ci a quitt\u00e9 la chambre pour aller \u00e0 sa pause-caf\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s un accident, il est trop facile d\u2019aborder la question de faute \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui s\u2019est produit et, en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, il me para\u00eet que l\u2019argumentation soumise pour le compte de l\u2019appelant refl\u00e8te cette mani\u00e8re d\u2019aborder l\u2019affaire.\nPr\u00e9tendre que Mlle Tennessy a fait preuve de n\u00e9gligence en r\u00e9glant sa conduite sur une opinion que partageait le chirurgien traitant c\u2019est, selon moi, exiger plus que ce que doit faire une infirmi\u00e8re raisonnablement prudente et comp\u00e9tente.\nComme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, pour tous ces motifs, je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter le pourvoi avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens, LE JUGE EN CHEF CARTWRIGHT et LE JUGE SPENCE \u00e9tant dissidents.\nProcureurs du demandeur, appelant: Bull, Housser & Tupper, Vancouver.\nProcureurs des d\u00e9fendeurs, intim\u00e9s: Harper, Gilmour, Grey & Co., Vancouver.\n[1] (1968), 67 W.W.R. 169, 2 D.L.R.

Il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu que S devait fournir une garantie d\u2019ex\u00e9cution, et c\u2019est la d\u00e9fenderesse T qui a fourni cette garantie au montant de $896,723. S a commenc\u00e9 le travail en septembre 1958 et a suspendu ses op\u00e9rations en f\u00e9vrier, pr\u00e9tendant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible de les continuer \u00e0 cause de l\u2019abondance de neige. A la suite de pourparlers avec F et P, S a repris les travaux mais \u00e9ventuellement elle les abandonnait compl\u00e8tement, sous pr\u00e9texte que F et P avaient viol\u00e9 le contrat. F et P ont intent\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente action \u00e0 T, caution de S, pour le plein montant de la garantie d\u2019ex\u00e9cution. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et ceux de la Cour d\u2019appel ont conclu que S avait fait d\u00e9faut et \u00e9tait responsable des dommages. Ils ont aussi conclu que T \u00e9tait tenu de payer, en vertu de la garantie d\u2019ex\u00e9cution. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a accord\u00e9 des dommages au montant de $820,332.10, mais ce montant a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duit par la Cour d\u2019appel \u00e0 la somme de $606,873.80. La d\u00e9fenderesse T en appela \u00e0 cette Cour et les demanderesses F et P ont produit un contre-appel. Arr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 et le contre-appel accueilli.\nLa preuve justifie pleinement les conclusions des deux Cours sur la responsabilit\u00e9, et on ne doit pas les modifier.\nLa r\u00e9clamation de F et P pour frais g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, estim\u00e9s \u00e0 30.62 pour-cent des frais directs, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas excessive. La preuve justifiait la conclusion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance et de la majorit\u00e9 en Cour d\u2019appel quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on de fixer les frais g\u00e9n\u00e9raux.\nIl y a eu jugements concordants \u00e9tablissant que S n\u2019avait pas droit \u00e0 une somme suppl\u00e9mentaire pour l\u2019essouchement hors des limites d\u00e9sign\u00e9es par le propri\u00e9taire.\nLes obligations qu\u2019assumaient F et P par une entente subs\u00e9quente d\u2019augmenter le prix \u00e0 l\u2019unit\u00e9 pour le d\u00e9frichement, \u00e9taient conditionnelles au sens de l\u2019art. 1079 du Code Civil et elles n\u2019ont pas eu d\u2019effet.

Le jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, rendu le 25 juin 1965, avait condamn\u00e9 l\u2019appelante \u00e0 payer aux intim\u00e9es la somme de $820,332.10 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats, et les frais. En contre-appel, les intim\u00e9es demandaient que le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance soit r\u00e9tabli.\nPour abr\u00e9ger, je d\u00e9signerai l\u2019appelante sous le nom de \u00abTravelers\u00bb, les intim\u00e9es sous celui de \u00abPitts-Foley\u00bb et la mise-en-cause sous celui de \u00abStormont\u00bb.\nLes faits sont relat\u00e9s en d\u00e9tail dans les jugements des tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs. On peut les r\u00e9sumer comme suit: Le 8 septembre 1958, Pitts-Foley s\u2019engageait par contrat envers Quebec Cartier Mining Company \u00e0 construire un chemin de fer allant de Shelter Bay, sur la rive nord du Fleuve Saint-Laurent \u00e0 un gisement minier au lac Jeannine. Pitts-Foley de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 engageait un certain nombre de sous-traitants. Parmi eux on trouve Stormont (contrat du 21 octobre 1958), qui devait se charger du d\u00e9frichement et de l\u2019essouchement de l\u2019emplacement. Une condition du contrat pr\u00e9voyait que Stormont devait fournir une garantie d\u2019ex\u00e9cution et Travelers a fourni cette garantie le 16 septembre 1958, au montant de $896,723.\nStormont a commenc\u00e9 le travail en septembre 1958, soit avant la signature du contrat avec Pitts-Foley et a continu\u00e9 ses op\u00e9rations jusqu\u2019au 27 f\u00e9vrier 1959, date o\u00f9 elle les a suspendues, pr\u00e9tendant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible de les continuer \u00e0 cause de l\u2019abondance de neige. A la suite de pourparlers entre Pitts-Foley et Stormont, cette derni\u00e8re a repris les travaux le 17 avril et les a continu\u00e9s tant bien que mal jusqu\u2019au d\u00e9but de juillet 1959. Stormont les abandonna alors compl\u00e8tement, sous pr\u00e9texte que Pitts-Foley avait viol\u00e9 le contrat.\nEn ao\u00fbt 1960, Stormont a intent\u00e9 une action par laquelle elle r\u00e9clamait de Pitts-Foley la somme de $657,142.24 en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour violation de contrat ou, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut, la somme de $494,000, \u00e0 titre de valeur des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s. En septembre 1960, Pitts-Foley r\u00e9pliquait par une poursuite de $1,212,648.77 contre Stormont \u00e0 titre de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour violation de contrat. En m\u00eame temps, Pitts-Foley a intent\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente action \u00e0 Travelers, caution de Stormont, pour la somme de $896,723, soit le plein montant de la garantie d\u2019ex\u00e9cution. Une fois la contestation li\u00e9e, Pitts-Foley a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pour faire instruire les trois actions en m\u00eame temps. Les actions entre Pitts-Foley et Stormont ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9unies mais, pour une raison qui m\u2019\u00e9chappe, on a refus\u00e9 de joindre l\u2019action contre Travelers aux deux autres. Le proc\u00e8s sur les actions de Pitts-Foley et de Stormont s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 devant le Juge Andr\u00e9 Demers. Apr\u00e8s de longs d\u00e9bats, celui-ci a rendu deux jugements, le 28 juillet 1964: l\u2019un maintenait l\u2019action de Pitts-Foley et l\u2019autre renvoyait celle de Stormont. Le montant des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats que devait payer Stormont, soit la somme de $843,122.48, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 par le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance mais r\u00e9sultait du consentement des parties intervenu avant le jugement. Travelers, qui \u00e9tait intervenue dans l\u2019action de Stormont contre Pitts-Foley, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 partie \u00e0 ce consentement et, il est reconnu qu\u2019il ne la lie pas.\nStormont en a appel\u00e9 de ces deux jugements et les appels sont encore pendants, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019on attend le r\u00e9sultat du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi.\nApr\u00e8s que les jugements contre Stormont eurent \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus, Pitts-Foley a fait inscrire la pr\u00e9sente cause pour audition. Le proc\u00e8s s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 devant le Juge Robinson, de janvier \u00e0 mai 1965. Les parties ont convenu que tous les t\u00e9moignages et toutes les pi\u00e8ces qui avaient servi dans les deux affaires Stormont seraient mis en preuve dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, chacune des parties se r\u00e9servant de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des pi\u00e8ces suppl\u00e9mentaires, ce qu\u2019elles firent toutes deux d\u2019ailleurs.\nPar jugement rendu le 25 juin 1965, la Cour a condamn\u00e9 Travelers \u00e0 verser \u00e0 Pitts-Foley la somme de $820,332.10, soit le montant total qu\u2019avait r\u00e9clam\u00e9 cette derni\u00e8re dans son action, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat depuis la date de l\u2019institution de l\u2019action et les frais. Travelers en a appel\u00e9 de ce jugement \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel. Comme je l\u2019ai dit, celle-ci, par son arr\u00eat du 26 juillet 1968, a accueilli l\u2019appel jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de $213,458.30, r\u00e9duisant la condamnation prononc\u00e9e par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la somme de $606,873.80.\nLe savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance et ceux de la Cour d\u2019appel ont \u00e9t\u00e9 unanimes \u00e0 conclure que: (1) Stormont avait fait d\u00e9faut de remplir ses obligations en vertu du contrat entre elle et Pitss-Foley et, (2) elle \u00e9tait responsable des dommages subis par cette derni\u00e8re, conclusion \u00e0 laquelle en \u00e9tait venu le Juge Demers dans les affaires Stormont. Ils ont tous conclu que Travelers \u00e9tait tenue de payer, en vertu de la garantie d\u2019ex\u00e9cution. La preuve justifie pleinement ces conclusions et je ne les modifierai pas. Il ne reste donc que la seule question du montant des dommages.\nA ce sujet, Travelers a soulev\u00e9 devant la Cour d\u2019appel et cette Cour surtout les points suivants: (1) que la r\u00e9clamation de Pitts-Foley pour frais g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, estim\u00e9s \u00e0 30.62 p. 100 des frais directs, \u00e9tait excessive, (2) qu\u2019on aurait d\u00fb accorder un cr\u00e9dit suppl\u00e9mentaire pour d\u00e9frichement du fait que la somme aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre calcul\u00e9e \u00e0 raison de $202.70 l\u2019acre et non de $157.60 l\u2019acre comme le stipulait le contrat et, (3) qu\u2019on aurait d\u00fb accorder un cr\u00e9dit suppl\u00e9mentaire pour essouchement hors des limites d\u00e9sign\u00e9es par le propri\u00e9taire. Le montant du cr\u00e9dit additionnel demand\u00e9 sous ce dernier chef s\u2019\u00e9levait \u00e0 $225,684.\nComme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, la Cour d\u2019appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 unanime \u00e0 conclure que Travelers \u00e9tait tenue de payer. La majorit\u00e9, (soit le Juge en Chef Tremblay et le Juge Montgomery) a conclu qu\u2019il fallait accorder un cr\u00e9dit suppl\u00e9mentaire pour le d\u00e9frichement, soit $213,458.30, et a r\u00e9duit d\u2019autant les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats que le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance avait accord\u00e9s. Le Juge Montgomery, dissident sur certaines questions, aurait accord\u00e9 un cr\u00e9dit suppl\u00e9mentaire en refusant partiellement la r\u00e9clamation de Pitts-Foley pour frais g\u00e9n\u00e9raux. Le Juge Rivard \u00e9tait dissident; il aurait confirm\u00e9 le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance et rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel.\nDe ce r\u00e9sum\u00e9, on peut voir qu\u2019il y a eu jugements concordants \u00e9tablissant que Stormont n\u2019avait pas droit \u00e0 une somme suppl\u00e9mentaire pour l\u2019essouchement. Le Juge Rivard a examin\u00e9 cette question \u00e0 fond dans ses motifs, et sur ce point le Juge en Chef Tremblay et le Juge Montgomery sont d\u2019accord avec lui. Je suis \u00e9galement d\u2019accord avec ces motifs et je n\u2019ai rien d\u2019utile \u00e0 y ajouter.\nQuant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on de fixer les frais g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, la preuve justifiait la conclusion du Juge de premi\u00e8re instance et de majorit\u00e9 en Cour d\u2019appel. Je souscris \u00e0 cette conclusion.\nJ\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit que Pitts-Foley a interjet\u00e9 un contre-appel de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel r\u00e9duisant le montant des dommages de $820,332.70 \u00e0 $606,873.80. Cette d\u00e9cision se fondait sur l\u2019in- terpr\u00e9tation et l\u2019application d\u2019une entente conclue le 13 avril 1959, en vertu de laquelle Stormont devait recevoir, moyennant certaines conditions, $202.70 l\u2019acre au lieu de $157.60 pour le d\u00e9frichement de l\u2019emplacement.\nStormont, en violation du contrat, avait abandonn\u00e9 les travaux \u00e0 la fin de f\u00e9vrier 1959, pr\u00e9textant que les conditions climatiques \u00e9taient trop mauvaises. Il semble clair, toutefois, que cette suspension visait \u00e0 forcer Pitts-Foley \u00e0 faire des concessions quant aux prix. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, cette derni\u00e8re a fait tout ce qu\u2019elle a pu pour que Stormont reprenne le travail. Une s\u00e9rie de propositions et de contre-propositions a finalement abouti \u00e0 une entente consign\u00e9e dans une lettre du 13 avril 1959.\nCette lettre se lit comme suit:\n[TRADUCTION]\nStormont General Contractors Limited\n2345, rue Viau\nMontr\u00e9al (P.Q.)\nComp\u00e9tence de: M.J.G. Joncas\nPr\u00e9sident\nMessieurs,\nLa pr\u00e9sente confirme les ententes que nous avons conclues au sujet du d\u00e9frichement que vous devez faire relativement \u00e0 la construction du chemin de fer de Shelter Bay (Qu\u00e9bec) au lac Jeannine, en vertu du contrat intervenu entre nous le 21 octobre 1958.\nMoyennant que vous vous soumettiez \u00e0 toutes les conditions ci-apr\u00e8s stipul\u00e9es, au cas o\u00f9 les frais r\u00e9els de d\u00e9frichement d\u00e9passeraient la somme de $157.60 l\u2019acre fix\u00e9e au contrat, nous vous paierons, au lieu du prix stipul\u00e9 au contrat, le co\u00fbt r\u00e9el du d\u00e9frichement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de $202.70 l\u2019acre, selon le prix d\u00e9termin\u00e9 et attest\u00e9 par nos v\u00e9rificateurs.\nA l\u2019avenir, les paiements pour le d\u00e9frichement se feront de la mani\u00e8re suivante:\nI. Nous ferons des paiements selon l\u2019avancement des travaux, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la clause IV du contrat, au prix fix\u00e9 de $157.60 l\u2019acre.\nII. Lorsque le bois de toute l\u2019aire de d\u00e9frichement aura \u00e9t\u00e9 coup\u00e9 et empil\u00e9, nous vous paierons, dans les trente (30) jours qui suivront l\u2019acceptation de telle aire par les propri\u00e9taires, toute somme suppl\u00e9mentaire requise pour ajuster le prix \u00e0 l\u2019acre au co\u00fbt r\u00e9el de d\u00e9frichement, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence du prix susdit, ainsi que le d\u00e9termineront et l\u2019attesteront nos v\u00e9rificateurs, moins les sommes que retiendront les propri\u00e9taires pour assurer le br\u00fblage.\nIII. Lorsque tout le br\u00fblage sera compl\u00e9t\u00e9 et accept\u00e9 par les propri\u00e9taires, nous vous paierons tout solde d\u00fb pour le br\u00fblage.\nLes conditions sont les suivantes:\n(a) Vous reprendrez les travaux au plus tard le 20 avril 1959 et vous les continuerez sans interruption jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils soient compl\u00e9t\u00e9s aux termes du contrat, selon un calendrier que vous nous soumettrez et que nous devrons approuver, le tout conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la clause n\u00b0 16 de l\u2019annexe A du contrat.\n(b) Vous nous soumettrez au plus tard le 20 avril 1959, la preuve \u00e0 notre satisfaction que le montant en capital de la garantie d\u2019ex\u00e9cution assum\u00e9e par The Travelers Insurance Company et que vous nous fournissez en vertu du contrat, garantit l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de tous les travaux et leur co\u00fbt tel que ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9.\n(c) Vous permettrez \u00e0 nos v\u00e9rificateurs de prendre connaissance de vos livres et de vos dossiers en tout temps durant les heures d\u2019affaires pour qu\u2019ils puissent d\u00e9terminer le co\u00fbt r\u00e9el du d\u00e9frichement.\nSi vous vous soumettez aux conditions ci-dessus, nous nous engageons \u00e0 soustraire du nombre d\u2019acres que vous avez \u00e0 d\u00e9fricher en vertu du contrat le nombre d\u2019acres que nous avons d\u00e9frich\u00e9s nous-m\u00eames \u00e0 votre place, depuis l\u2019arr\u00eat des travaux le 2 mars 1959. Nous assumerons le co\u00fbt complet du d\u00e9frichement que nous avons fait et nous garderons toutes les sommes que nous recevrons des propri\u00e9taires en paiement de tel d\u00e9frichement.\nLa pr\u00e9sente lettre, sous r\u00e9serve de votre acceptation, constituera une entente qui nous liera. Sauf dans la mesure o\u00f9 il est express\u00e9ment modifi\u00e9 par les pr\u00e9sentes, le contrat intervenu entre nous, le 21 octobre 1958, demeure en vigueur.\nSi la pr\u00e9sente vous agr\u00e9e, veuillez signer la copie ci-jointe et nous la retourner.\nTr\u00e8s sinc\u00e8rement v\u00f4tre,\nPITTS-FOLEY\nmc:\nL.G. Lofholm\nVice-pr\u00e9sident\nACCEPT\u00c9E, ce jour de 1959.\nSTORMONT GENERAL CONTRACTORS LIMITED\npar: J. G\u00e9rard Joncas The Travelers Indemnity Company consent aux modifications d\u00e9finies dans la pr\u00e9sente lettre.\nOscar H. Gaudet\nOSCAR H. GAUDET\nProcureur de fait\nA mon avis, les obligations qu\u2019assumait Pitts-Foley par cette lettre \u00e9taient conditionnelles, au sens de l\u2019art. 1079 du Code civil et elles n\u2019ont pas eu d\u2019effet. Le Juge Rivard a trait\u00e9 la question de fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9cise et concise en disant:\nLes travaux ont recommenc\u00e9 le 13 avril 1959, mais ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finitivement abandonn\u00e9s le 6 juillet 1959. L\u2019essouchement n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 repris que le 23 mai et \u00e9videmment arr\u00eat\u00e9 \u00e9galement le 6 juillet. Les conditions pos\u00e9es par Pitts-Foley dans cette entente du 13 avril n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9es par Stormont, et Pitts-Foley ne peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s en d\u00e9faut en ne payant \u00e0 Stormont que les prix stipul\u00e9s dans le contrat originaire.\nIl s\u2019ensuit que le contrat entre Stormont et Pitts-Foley n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 et, qu\u2019en \u00e9tablissant sa r\u00e9clamation en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, Pitts-Foley n\u2019\u00e9tait tenue de verser ou de porter au cr\u00e9dit de Stormont, pour le d\u00e9frichement, que le prix \u00e0 l\u2019unit\u00e9 convenu dans le contrat du 21 octobre 1958.\nPour ces motifs et pour ceux qu\u2019a exprim\u00e9s le Juge Rivard et auxquels je souscris, je suis d\u2019avis de rejeter l\u2019appel et d\u2019accueillir le contre-appel, avec d\u00e9pens dans les deux cas.\nAppel rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens; contre-appel accueilli avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs de la d\u00e9fenderesse, appelante: Foster, Watt, Leggat, Colby, Rioux & Malcolm, Montr\u00e9al.\nProcureurs des demanderesses, intim\u00e9es: Lafleur & Brown, Montr\u00e9al.\n[1] [1968] B.R. 908.",

Une nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e en corporation en Ontario. Les appelants \u00e9taient actionnaires de cette nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en proportion \u00e9gale \u00e0 leur part respective dans l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Tous les avoirs de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus \u00e0 la nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en \u00e9change d\u2019un billet \u00e0 ordre pour un montant de $2,611,769. La nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a obtenu un pr\u00eat bancaire pour payer l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019est servie de cet argent pour acheter des actions privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es de deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e9tablies \u00e0 Vancouver. Les appelants ont vendu comptant aux deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de Vancouver leurs actions de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 raison d\u2019un dollar pour un dollar de capital et de 95 c. pour un dollar de revenu non distribu\u00e9. Les appelants ont alors investi une partie de cet argent dans l\u2019achat d\u2019obligations de la nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Lorsque toutes les transactions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9es, le revenu non distribu\u00e9 de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait entre les mains des appelants, partie en esp\u00e8ces et partie en obligations de la nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9, aucun imp\u00f4t sur le revenu n\u2019ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 sur cette r\u00e9partition. Le Ministre a cotis\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau les appelants en vertu de l\u2019art. 81(1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, S.R.C. 1952, c. 148. La Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier a confirm\u00e9 la cotisation mais a fond\u00e9 son jugement sur l\u2019application des art. 137(2) et 8(1) de la Loi. Les contribuables en ont appel\u00e9 \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nL\u2019article 81(1) de la Loi s\u2019applique clairement. Il y a eu liquidation et cessation de l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9, bien qu\u2019il soit apparent qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu de liquidation en bonne et due forme aux termes de la Loi sur les liquidations ou des dispositions de liquidation de l\u2019Ontario Companies Act.

Leurs appels \u00e0 la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier1 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9s. A mon avis, les pourvois \u00e0 cette Cour devraient aussi \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s.\nLes appelants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cotis\u00e9s \u00e0 nouveau parce qu\u2019ils ont re\u00e7u et n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 parmi leurs revenus pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1961 le revenu non distribu\u00e9 d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9\u2014C. Smythe Limited dont ils \u00e9taient actionnaires. Ils d\u00e9tenaient les actions de cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans les proportions suivantes:\nConn Smythe.............................................\n52.0 p. 100\nConn Stafford Smythe..............................\n30.8 p. 100\nClarence H.

Boyd.\nEn 1961, C. Smythe Limited \u00e9tait une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 active qui avait des avoirs consid\u00e9rables et un \u00abrevenu en main non distribu\u00e9\u00bb de $728,652. Lorsque les transactions que je me propose d\u2019exposer ci-apr\u00e8s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9es, ce revenu non distribu\u00e9 \u00e9tait entre les mains des actionnaires de C. Smythe Limited ($275,336 en esp\u00e8ces et $453,316 en obligations ne portant pas int\u00e9r\u00eat d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nouvellement constitu\u00e9e, C. Smythe for Sand Limited). En parlant de ces deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, je dirai maintenant \u00abl\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9\u00bb et \u00abla nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9\u00bb. La demande de constitution en corporation de la nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est dat\u00e9e du 13 d\u00e9cembre 1961. Les lettres patentes sont dat\u00e9es du 15 d\u00e9cembre 1961, bien qu\u2019elles n\u2019aient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9es et enregistr\u00e9es par le Secr\u00e9taire provincial que le 4 janvier 1962. Ce fait ne change rien au caract\u00e8re juridique des transactions en question.\n1. Le 15 d\u00e9cembre 1961, les administrateurs de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ont autoris\u00e9 la vente de tous ses avoirs \u00e0 la nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n2. Le 15 d\u00e9cembre 1961, les administrateurs de la nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 se sont r\u00e9unis et:\n(a) ont autoris\u00e9 la r\u00e9partition de 10,000 actions ordinaires de la nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 aux actionnaires de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en proportion \u00e9gale \u00e0 leurs parts respectives dans l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9;\n(b) ont autoris\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9mission d\u2019obligations ne portant pas int\u00e9r\u00eat jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de $2,750,000 et venant \u00e0 \u00e9ch\u00e9ance le 15 d\u00e9cembre 1981; et\n(c) ont approuv\u00e9 l\u2019achat de tous les avoirs de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n3. Le 20 d\u00e9cembre, F.H. Cameron Ltd. et Dabne Enterprises (deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e9tablies \u00e0 Vancouver) ont consenti \u00e0 acheter comptant toutes les actions \u00e9mises de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 raison d\u2019un dollar pour un dollar de capital et de 95c. pour un dollar de revenu non distribu\u00e9.\n4. Le 22 d\u00e9cembre, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu que la transaction pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e serait conclue \u00e0 Vancouver le 28 d\u00e9cembre. 5. Le 27 d\u00e9cembre, les chiffres d\u00e9finitifs pour la transaction ont \u00e9t\u00e9 convenus, savoir:\nAvoirs de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (y compris le revenu non distribu\u00e9 de $728,652).......................................................\n$2,611,769\nRemise de 5 p. 100 sur revenu non distribu\u00e9..................\n$36,433\nPlus les honoraires suppl\u00e9mentaires de F.H.

Le 27 d\u00e9cembre, des arrangements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pris avec la Banque Toronto-Dominion \u00e0 Toronto en vertu desquels la banque accordait un pr\u00eat de $316,769 \u00e0 la nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9, remboursable le 2 janvier 1962. Ce pr\u00eat \u00e9tait garanti par un d\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e0 terme fixe de $800,000, dont le titre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n7. Le 28 d\u00e9cembre, des arrangements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pris avec la Banque Toronto-Dominion \u00e0 Toronto pour une traite au montant de $2,611,769 \u00e0 tirer sur la Banque Toronto-Dominion \u00e0 Vancouver au d\u00e9bit de la nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et payable \u00e0 l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n8. Le 28 d\u00e9cembre, la Banque de Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 Vancouver a ouvert un compte au nom de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9, F.H. Cameron et Bone (un de ses associ\u00e9s) \u00e9tant fond\u00e9s de pouvoir. La Banque a aussi pr\u00eat\u00e9 $1,285,000 \u00e0 F.H. Cameron Ltd. et $1,280,000 \u00e0 Dabne Enterprises et obtenu des billets \u00e0 ordre pour ces montants qui ont ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9dit\u00e9s aux comptes respectifs de ces deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s. Deux traites ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9es imm\u00e9diatement sur ces comptes, soit $1,285,168 (F.H. Cameron Ltd.) et $1,285,168 (Dabne) payables \u00e0 la Banque Toronto\u2011Dominion, Vancouver.\n9. Le 28 d\u00e9cembre, vers le milieu de la journ\u00e9e, des r\u00e9unions simultan\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues au si\u00e8ge social de la Banque Toronto-Dominion \u00e0 Toronto et \u00e0 la succursale principale de la Banque Toronto-Dominion \u00e0 Vancouver. R\u00e9sultat de ces r\u00e9unions: tous les actionnaires de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ont d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de leurs postes d\u2019administrateurs et de directeurs de cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et son sceau, ses archives et son capital-actions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remis \u00e0 Cameron et \u00e0 ses associ\u00e9s. Il y a eu un \u00e9change de traites bancaires; la traite Toronto-Dominion de $2,611,769 a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9dit\u00e9e au compte de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la Banque de Montr\u00e9al, Vancouver, tandis que les traites de la Banque de Montr\u00e9al au montant de $2,570,336 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 la Banque Toronto-Dominion, Vancouver.

Le 2 janvier 1962, deux ch\u00e8ques, chacun pour un montant de $1,305,600, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9s sur le compte de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la Banque de Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 Vancouver par Cameron et son associ\u00e9 Bone. Ceux-ci ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux comptes de F.H. Cameron Ltd. et Dabne Enterprises Ltd. et, en m\u00eame temps, ces comptes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9bit\u00e9s du remboursement des pr\u00eats consentis par la banque.\n11. Le 2 janvier \u00e0 4 heures 30, les administrateurs de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ont autoris\u00e9 celle-ci \u00e0 investir $2,611,200 dans l\u2019achat d\u2019actions privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es de F.H. Cameron Ltd. et de Dabne Enterprises, ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, le r\u00e9sultat de ces transactions est le suivant:\nAfter\u2014Apr\u00e8s\nHad $275,336 cash plus $2,285,000 debentures plus shares of new company issued for $10,000\nAvaient $275,336 en esp\u00e8ces, plus $2,285,000 en obligations, plus des actions de la nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mises pour $10,000 After\u2014Apr\u00e8s\nHad preference shares of Cameron companies, a new location in Vancouver, and no business\nAvait des actions privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Cameron et un nouveau si\u00e8ge-social \u00e0 Vancouver, mais aucune activit\u00e9 commerciale\nHad the former assets and active business of old company; owed $2,285,000 to its shareholders on debentures\nAvait les avoirs et le commerce actif de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9; devait en obligations $2,285,000 \u00e0 ses actionnaires\nHad a cash fee of $41,433 and shares of old company, which had no business and whose only assets consisted of shares of the Cameron companies\nAvait des honoraires pay\u00e9es en esp\u00e8ces de $41,433 et des actions de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9, qui n\u2019avait pas d\u2019activit\u00e9 commerciale et dont les seuls avoirs consistaient en actions des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Cameron\nIl n\u2019y a qu\u2019une conclusion possible de l\u2019examen de ces transactions artificielles et c\u2019est que leur seul but \u00e9tait de r\u00e9partir ou autrement affecter \u00e0 l\u2019avantage des actionnaires le \u00abrevenu en main non distribu\u00e9\u00bb de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Aucune preuve testimoniale ou autre preuve documentaire n\u2019est requise en sus de cet examen. Toutefois, il y avait en plus une surabondance de preuve. C\u2019\u00e9tait un plan bien r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi adopt\u00e9 sur l\u2019avis de conseillers professionnels, apr\u00e8s que d\u2019autres moyens d\u2019obtenir le revenu non distribu\u00e9, y compris le paiement d\u2019un imp\u00f4t en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019art. 105(b) de la Loi, eurent \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9s et rejet\u00e9s.\nA mon avis, l\u2019art. 81(1) de la Loi s\u2019applique clairement et impose l\u2019imp\u00f4t exig\u00e9 par les nouveaux avis de cotisation. L\u2019art. 81(1) se lit comme suit:\n81. (1) Lorsque, au moment o\u00f9 la corporation avait en main un revenu non distribu\u00e9, des fonds ou des biens d\u2019une corporation ont, de quelque fa\u00e7on, \u00e9t\u00e9 distribu\u00e9s \u00e0 un ou plusieurs de ses actionnaires, ou autrement affect\u00e9s \u00e0 leur avantage, lors de la liquidation, de la cessation ou de la r\u00e9organisation de son entreprise, chaque actionnaire est cens\u00e9 d\u2019avoir re\u00e7u \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque un dividende \u00e9gal au moindre\n(a) du montant des fonds ou de la valeur des biens ainsi distribu\u00e9s ou \u00e0 lui affect\u00e9s, ou\n(b) de sa portion du revenu non distribu\u00e9 alors en main.\nIl n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de s\u2019en rapporter \u00e0 aucun autre article de la Loi. Celui-l\u00e0 s\u2019applique pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019affaire qui est devant nous.\nLe Juge Gibson de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier d\u00e9finit la question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\n[TRADUCTION] La question \u00e0 d\u00e9cider est de savoir si oui ou non ces transactions ont eu pour r\u00e9sultat de conf\u00e9rer un avantage aux appelants au sens du paragraphe (2) de l\u2019article 137 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu; au cas o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision sur la question principale est affirmative, une question subsidiaire est de savoir si le montant de cet avantage devrait \u00eatre cotis\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019article 8(1) ou de l\u2019article 81(1) de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu.\nSoit dit en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, il n\u2019est ni utile ni souhaitable que la question soit d\u00e9finie en ces termes. Je crois qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce l\u2019art. 81(1) de la Loi s\u2019applique clairement et qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019exprimer une opinion sur la port\u00e9e de l\u2019art. 137(2) de la Loi.\nIl ne semble y avoir aucun doute que les nouvelles cotisations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites en vertu de l\u2019art. 81(1) de la Loi, en se fondant sur le fait qu\u2019il y avait eu liquidation, cessation ou r\u00e9organisation de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Le Juge Gibson \u00e9tait dans le doute \u00e0 ce sujet bien qu\u2019il ait exprim\u00e9 l\u2019opinion que s\u2019il avait eu \u00e0 \u00e9tablir la cotisation, il en serait venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu de liquidation, cessation ou r\u00e9organisation de l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9 au sens de l\u2019art. 81(1).\nJe ne suis pas d\u2019accord avec cette opinion et je fonderais mon jugement sur cet article, et sur lui seulement. Ces cotisations devaient \u00eatre faites en vertu de cet article avec la cons\u00e9quence n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019un d\u00e9gr\u00e8vement aux termes de l\u2019art. 38(1). Si je comprends bien, c\u2019est ce que le fonctionnaire a fait.\nLa Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier laisse le r\u00e9sultat intact, mais fonde son jugement sur l\u2019application des art. 137(2) et 8(1). Si ces articles \u00e9taient ap- pliqu\u00e9s, il n\u2019y aurait pas de d\u00e9gr\u00e8vement pour dividendes. Il y a l\u00e0 un illogisme dans le jugement de la Cour de l\u2019\u00c9chiquier. Je dirais donc qu\u2019il y a eu liquidation et cessation de l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9, bien qu\u2019il soit apparent qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu de liquidation en bonne et due forme aux termes de la Loi sur les liquidations ou des dispositions de liquidation de l\u2019Ontario Companies Act.\nJe me contente d\u2019adopter la d\u00e9cision du Juge Maclean dans Merritt c. Le ministre du Revenu national[2]:\n[TRADUCTION] Je n\u2019\u00e9prouve aucune difficult\u00e9 quant \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation \u00e0 donner aux termes \u00abliquidation, cessation ou r\u00e9organisation\u00bb tels qu\u2019ils sont utilis\u00e9s dans l\u2019art. 19(1) de la Loi. En interpr\u00e9tant ces termes, nous devons consid\u00e9rer la substance et la forme de ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait ici. Dans la cause In Re South African Supply and Cold Storage Company (1904) 2 ch. D., 268, le Juge Buckley devait d\u00e9cider si oui ou non il y avait eu une liquidation aux fins de reconstitution ou de fusion; il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 (traduction) que ni le mot reconstitution ni le mot fusion n\u2019ont un sens juridique d\u00e9fini. Chacun d\u2019entre eux est un terme commercial et non un terme juridique, et m\u00eame comme terme commercial n\u2019a pas un sens exact. Je crois que cela serait \u00e9galement vrai des termes de l\u2019art. 19(1) que je viens de mentionner. Il n\u2019y a pas eu de \u00abliquidation\u00bb de la Security Company par un liquidateur, mais je crois qu\u2019en fait il y a eu liquidation des affaires de cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et que ce sens peut \u00eatre donn\u00e9 ici au mot \u00abliquidation\u00bb, bien que je n\u2019aie pas \u00e0 d\u00e9cider cat\u00e9goriquement car, de toute fa\u00e7on, il y a eu cessation des affaires de la Security Company, et que cela ait \u00e9t\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019une vente \u00e0 la Premier Company ou d\u2019une fusion avec celle-ci est, \u00e0 mon avis, sans importance. Je pense donc qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas mati\u00e8re \u00e0 discussion quant au fond mais que la Security Company a cess\u00e9 ses op\u00e9rations au sens r\u00e9el et commercial, et que moyennant compensation elle a dispos\u00e9 de tous ses biens et avoirs, si loin que cela puisse nous mener pour d\u00e9cider de cette affaire. Il n\u2019est donc aucunement n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019essayer de donner une d\u00e9finition pr\u00e9cise des mots \u00abliquidation, cessation ou r\u00e9organisation\u00bb. Pour ce qui est de la Security Company on s\u2019en est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s tenu au sens et \u00e0 l\u2019esprit de ces termes. Je ne doute pas non plus qu\u2019il y ait eu une distribution des biens de la Security Company entre ses actionnaires, au sens o\u00f9 l\u2019entend l\u2019art. 19(1) de la Loi, en vertu des termes de l\u2019Accord apr\u00e8s sa ratification par les actionnaires de la Security Company. A mon avis, il importe peu que la contrepartie re\u00e7ue par l\u2019appelante pour ses actions lui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise directement par la Premier Company et non par l\u2019entremise de la Security Company.\nOn a interjet\u00e9 appel de ce jugement en notre Cour[3] et il est consign\u00e9 \u00e0 (1942) R.C.S. p. 269. Cette Cour a confirm\u00e9 la conclusion du Juge Maclean \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il y avait eu une liquidation, cessation ou r\u00e9organisation. La cassation partielle du jugement du Juge Maclean est uniquement fond\u00e9e sur une interpr\u00e9tation diff\u00e9rente de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019art. 19(1) d\u2019alors, soit \u00e0 quelles ann\u00e9es d\u2019imposition il s\u2019appliquait. L\u2019art. 19(1) est \u00e0 l\u2019origine du pr\u00e9sent art. 81(1) et, aux fins de ces motifs, il n\u2019y a aucune diff\u00e9rence entre les deux.\nLorsque cette s\u00e9rie de transactions a \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9e, l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avait des actions privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es des deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s l\u2019ayant d\u00e9barrass\u00e9e de son surplus de revenu non distribu\u00e9, F.H. Cameron Ltd. et Dabne Enterprises Ltd. de Vancouver, et elle n\u2019avait aucun autre avoir \u00e0 son actif. L\u2019actif garantissant les actions privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es de ces deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s consiste en actions de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ayant parcouru le m\u00eame chemin que l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nLes faits purs et simples d\u00e9montrent que, \u00e0 la fin de toute cette activit\u00e9,\n(a) les actionnaires de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9taient actionnaires de la nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dans la m\u00eame proportion qu\u2019ils l\u2019\u00e9taient dans l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Ils avaient souscrit ces actions et leur position en tant qu\u2019actionnaires n\u2019est pas contestable.\n(b) Mais, lorsque l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a transmis ses avoirs \u00e0 la nouvelle, le paiement aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre remis en entier \u00e0 l\u2019ancienne.\n(c) Ce paiement \u00e9tait de $2,611,769. Si la nouvelle soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sirait garantir le prix d\u2019achat par des obligations, celles-ci auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre \u00e9mises et livr\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Au lieu de cela, nous retrouvons le comptant et les obligations aux mains des actionnaires de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Il y a des moyens appropri\u00e9s de faire une telle r\u00e9partition, mais ces moyens comportent le paiement d\u2019imp\u00f4ts. En particulier, il n\u2019y a pas eu de vente des actions de l\u2019ancienne soci\u00e9t\u00e9 aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s qui l\u2019ont d\u00e9pouill\u00e9e de son surplus. Les actions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 c\u00e9d\u00e9es \u00e0 ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, avec des honoraires de $41,433, dans le but de leur permettre de faire certaines man\u0153uvres avec les ch\u00e8ques et traites de banque, pour arriver aux r\u00e9sultats cit\u00e9s dans ces motifs. L\u2019imposition ne peut pas \u00eatre \u00e9vit\u00e9e par ces transactions. La s\u00e9rie ordonn\u00e9e des mesures prises \u00e0 Vancouver lors de la conclusion de l\u2019op\u00e9ration ne vient pas au secours des appelants.\nJe rejetterais ces appels avec d\u00e9pens et je confirmerais les nouvelles cotisations faites en vertu de l\u2019art. 81(1).\nAppels rejet\u00e9s avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs de l\u2019appelant, Conn Stafford Smythe: Edison, Aird & Berlis, Toronto.\nProcureurs des appelants, Conn Smythe et Clarence H.

Elle \u00e9tait l\u00e0 depuis les deux heures de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi. Vers neuf heures du soir, une bruyante altercation eut lieu entre eux. Le d\u00e9fendeur B, qui \u00e9tait un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de g\u00e9rant de la taverne, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 qu\u2019il leur a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises de se tenir tranquilles. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que lorsque leur langage devint r\u00e9ellement grossier, il est sorti de derri\u00e8re le comptoir, a pos\u00e9 sa main sur l\u2019\u00e9paule du demandeur et lui a intim\u00e9 l\u2019ordre de quitter les lieux. Le demandeur ne se souvient plus de rien apr\u00e8s la dispute entre lui et sa compagne, mais la preuve fournie en sa faveur tend \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que le d\u00e9fendeur B l\u2019a frapp\u00e9 avec violence et sans raison, de sorte qu\u2019il tomba \u00e0 terre, sa t\u00eate donnant durement contre le carrelage. Le t\u00e9moignage de B corrobor\u00e9 par celui d\u2019autres clients, est \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il a simplement touch\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9paule et les bras du demandeur, l\u2019a dress\u00e9 sur ses pieds, et ensuite l\u2019a laiss\u00e9 debout et s\u2019est retourn\u00e9 pour ramasser la veste du demandeur qui, en raison de son \u00e9tat d\u2019ivresse, est alors tomb\u00e9 sur le plancher en se frappant la t\u00eate.\nLe proc\u00e8s de l\u2019action pour voies de fait intent\u00e9e au d\u00e9fendeur B et \u00e0 son employeur s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 devant jury. Le jury a r\u00e9pondu n\u00e9gativement \u00e0 la question suivante: le d\u00e9fendeur Balaban s\u2019est-il livr\u00e9 sans justification l\u00e9gale \u00e0 des voies de fait sur la personne du demandeur Mann? Sur la foi de cette r\u00e9ponse, le demandeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9bout\u00e9. Un appel devant la Cour d\u2019appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9 rejet\u00e9. Le pourvoi par devant cette Cour est fond\u00e9 uniquement sur une critique des directives du juge de premi\u00e8re instance au jury, en ce qu\u2019il aurait mal instruit le jury en lui disant que le fardeau de la preuve incombait au demandeur pour ce qui est des questions de la justification de l\u2019acte, d\u2019une excuse l\u00e9gitime et de l\u2019application d\u2019une force raisonnable.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre accueilli et un nouveau proc\u00e8s accord\u00e9, les Juges Martland et Judson \u00e9tant dissidents.\nLes Juges Hall, Spence et Pigeon: Dans une action pour voies de fait, il est \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il incombe au demandeur de prouver qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 attaqu\u00e9 et qu\u2019il a subi un pr\u00e9judice de ce fait. C\u2019est ensuite au d\u00e9fendeur d\u2019\u00e9tablir la d\u00e9fense, soit premi\u00e8rement que l\u2019attaque \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e, et deuxi\u00e8mement qu\u2019aucune force excessive ou non n\u00e9cessaire n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 ses directives au jury conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ces principes. Dans une affaire comme celle-ci, o\u00f9 les t\u00e9moignages sont tr\u00e8s fortement contradictoires, le jury devait recevoir des instructions pr\u00e9cises sur la question de savoir laquelle des deux parties a la charge de prouver un fait particulier ou d\u2019\u00e9tablir un point particulier.\nLa directive inexacte peut bien avoir influ\u00e9 sur le verdict et entra\u00een\u00e9 une erreur judiciaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, nonobstant le fait qu\u2019aucune objection n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par l\u2019avocat du demandeur apr\u00e8s les directives du juge, le pourvoi doit \u00eatre accueilli et un nouveau proc\u00e8s accord\u00e9.\nLes Juges Martland et Judson, dissidents: Les directives au jury, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des plaidoiries, des t\u00e9moignages apport\u00e9s et de l\u2019accord des parties sur la question \u00e0 poser au jury, \u00e9taient appropri\u00e9es. Dans les circonstances, le jury n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si un certain degr\u00e9 de force \u00e9tait excessif ou non. Si le jury \u00e9tait convaincu de la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de l\u2019histoire racont\u00e9e par les t\u00e9moins du demandeur, la force employ\u00e9e \u00e9tait ind\u00e9niablement excessive. Si le jury admettait la version du d\u00e9fendeur, il n\u2019y a pas eu de voies de fait du tout. Telle \u00e9tait la situation \u00e0 la cl\u00f4ture des d\u00e9bats. Compte tenu de tous les t\u00e9moignages, la question du fardeau de la preuve n\u2019avait plus aucune importance.\nDe plus, m\u00eame si ces directives peuvent \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es d\u2019inad\u00e9quates en ce qui concerne le fardeau de la preuve, il n\u2019y a pas eu un pr\u00e9judice s\u00e9rieux ou erreur judiciaire au d\u00e9triment du demandeur qui permettrait d\u2019ordonner un nouveau proc\u00e8s, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de l\u2019art. 28(1) de la loi The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 197.\nArr\u00eats mentionn\u00e9s: Cook c.

Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 l\u2019action ont eu lieu dans la taverne de l\u2019h\u00f4tel de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, sis \u00e0 Galt, Ontario, dans la soir\u00e9e du 23 d\u00e9cembre 1965, alors que le d\u00e9fendeur s\u2019est efforc\u00e9 d\u2019amener le demandeur \u00e0 quitter les lieux.\nLe proc\u00e8s s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 devant jury. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question suivante, le jury a rendu le verdict suivant:\n[TRADUCTION] Question n\u00b0 1: Le d\u00e9fendeur Balaban s\u2019est-il livr\u00e9 sans justification l\u00e9gale \u00e0 des voies de fait sur la personne du demandeur Mann?\nR\u00e9ponse: Non.\nSur la foi de cette r\u00e9ponse, le demandeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9bout\u00e9, sans adjudication de d\u00e9pens. Un appel devant la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ontario a \u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019unanimit\u00e9, rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens, sans motifs \u00e9crits. Le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi est \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de cet arr\u00eat. Il y a contradiction flagrante dans les t\u00e9moignages entendus au proc\u00e8s concernant certains des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont eu lieu. Le demandeur est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4tel vers 6 h. du soir et il s\u2019est assis \u00e0 une table avec Evelyn Killoran, avec qui il vivait en concubinage. Elle \u00e9tait l\u00e0 depuis les 2 h. de l\u2019apr\u00e8s\u2011midi. Vers 9 h. du soir, une bruyante altercation eut lieu entre eux.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur, qui \u00e9tait un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de g\u00e9rant de la taverne, leur a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises de se tenir tranquilles. Le d\u00e9fendeur a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que lorsque leur langage devint r\u00e9ellement grossier, il est sorti de derri\u00e8re le comptoir, a pos\u00e9 sa main sur l\u2019\u00e9paule du demandeur et lui a intim\u00e9 l\u2019ordre de quitter les lieux.\nLes t\u00e9moignages quant \u00e0 ce qui s\u2019ensuivit sont contradictoires. Le d\u00e9fendeur ne se rappelle rien de ce qui s\u2019est produit, mais Mme Killoran a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 que, sans avoir dit quoi que ce soit, le d\u00e9fendeur a frapp\u00e9 le demandeur sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la t\u00eate, l\u2019a soulev\u00e9 et l\u2019a jet\u00e9 durement sur le plancher. Deux autres t\u00e9moins ont affirm\u00e9 que le d\u00e9fendeur avait jet\u00e9 le demandeur sur le plancher.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 que le demandeur pri\u00e9 de sortir a alors entrepris de se lever. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019aplomb sur ses jambes et le d\u00e9fendeur se saisit de lui pour pr\u00e9venir sa chute. Quand le demandeur est parvenu \u00e0 l\u2019espace libre, pr\u00e8s de la table o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait assis, le d\u00e9fendeur a l\u00e2ch\u00e9 prise, et le demandeur est tomb\u00e9 sur le plancher. Cette version de l\u2019incident a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par plusieurs autres t\u00e9moins.\nLe demandeur s\u2019est frapp\u00e9 la t\u00eate contre le plancher et il a subi de graves blessures.\nA la suite de la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve, le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a donn\u00e9 ses directives au jury. Aucune objection n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par l\u2019avocat du demandeur, sauf sur un point de minime importance qui n\u2019int\u00e9resse en rien le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi. Les questions soumises au jury ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9es avec l\u2019accord des avocats de toutes les parties.\nL\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant pr\u00e9tend, dans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, qu\u2019il y a eu inexactitude ou omission dans les directives donn\u00e9es au jury quant au fardeau de la preuve, ce qui aurait entra\u00een\u00e9 une erreur judiciaire au d\u00e9triment de l\u2019appelant. L\u2019objection relative aux directives au jury se rapporte principalement aux passages suivants:\n[TRADUCTION] Maintenant, dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le demandeur M. Mann dit qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement assailli par le d\u00e9fendeur M. Balaban, et qu\u2019il a subi des dommages en raison des blessures qu\u2019il a souffertes du fait de cette attaque. Si le demandeur doit avoir gain de cause, il doit le prouver, et il doit le prouver selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. En d\u2019autres termes, pour que le demandeur ait gain de cause, il vous faut, vous membres du jury, \u00eatre convaincus qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 vraisemblablement assailli, sans justification l\u00e9gale, par le d\u00e9fendeur M. Balaban, et que, de ce fait, il a vraisemblablement subi des dommages, et si tel est le cas, vous fixerez alors une somme qui devra indemniser raisonnablement M. Mann de ses dommages.\nEn outre, pour que le demandeur ait gain de cause contre la d\u00e9fenderesse, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 h\u00f4teli\u00e8re, vous devez \u00eatre convaincus non seulement que M. Balaban a vraisemblablement assailli le demandeur sans justification l\u00e9gale, mais aussi qu\u2019il l\u2019a fait dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions aupr\u00e8s de la d\u00e9fenderesse, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 h\u00f4teli\u00e8re. Ainsi que je l\u2019ai dit, aux fins du pr\u00e9sent proc\u00e8s, une attaque sans justification l\u00e9gale peut se d\u00e9finir comme l\u2019application intentionnelle \u00e0 la personne du demandeur d\u2019une force ill\u00e9gale par le d\u00e9fendeur.\n* * *\nPour le demandeur, naturellement, l\u2019affaire consiste en ce que M. Balaban a us\u00e9 d\u2019une force excessive dans les circonstances, que la force employ\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait pas raisonnable et \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement hors de proportions avec ce que la situation r\u00e9clamait. C\u2019est ce que le demandeur pr\u00e9tend. C\u2019est \u00e0 vous de dire si cela est vrai ou non. Voyez-vous, voici comment on pr\u00e9sente la chose pour le demandeur M. Mann: \u00abEh bien, disons qu\u2019il se disputait dans la taverne, admettons que son langage \u00e9tait grossier, qu\u2019il cr\u00e9ait un certain d\u00e9sordre; quand m\u00eame, en supposant que tout cela est vrai, M. Balaban aurait d\u00fb trouver moyen de lui faire \u00e9vacuer les lieux sans lui fracturer le cr\u00e2ne.\u00bb\n* * *\nVoil\u00e0 qui r\u00e9sume assez bien toute l\u2019affaire, voyez-vous. Pour le demandeur, l\u2019affaire est qu\u2019il y a eu application d\u2019une force excessive, que M. Balaban s\u2019est approch\u00e9 du demandeur, l\u2019a soulev\u00e9 de sa chaise et l\u2019a jet\u00e9 sur le plancher. C\u2019est l\u00e0 un c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire.\n* * *\nEh bien, il y a d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9 l\u2019histoire de M. Balaban qui, avec une force d\u00e9raisonnable et injustifi\u00e9e, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les pr\u00e9tentions du demandeur, soulevant ce dernier de sa chaise, et par l\u2019application d\u2019une force excessive, le faisait se retrouver sur le plancher le cr\u00e2ne fractur\u00e9.\nEt l\u2019autre tableau, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par la d\u00e9fense, est \u00e0 l\u2019effet que M. Balaban, en maintenant l\u2019ordre dans la taverne, ainsi qu\u2019il avait droit de le faire, a aid\u00e9 et \u00e9tait en train d\u2019aider le demandeur \u00e0 quitter le si\u00e8ge qu\u2019il occupait, afin qu\u2019il puisse \u00eatre expuls\u00e9 de la salle, et que ce faisant, il n\u2019a pas employ\u00e9 une force plus que raisonnable ou n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 cette fin. De plus, il avait demand\u00e9 auparavant au demandeur de sortir mais ce dernier n\u2019\u00e9tait pas sorti.\nImm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s le passage que je viens de citer, le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance poursuit comme suit:\n[TRADUCTION] Maintenant, c\u2019est \u00e0 vous de dire ce que vous croyez \u00e0 ce sujet. Vous avez entendu tous les t\u00e9moins sur ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 au juste.\nVoici ce que je tiens \u00e0 vous dire, et il s\u2019agit ici de la loi concernant l\u2019expulsion des personnes. Si vous d\u00e9sirez faire quitter les lieux \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un, ordinairement aucune force n\u2019est justifi\u00e9e \u00e0 son endroit tant qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9 de quitter les lieux, et qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas eu tout loisir raisonnable de s\u2019ex\u00e9cuter. S\u2019il devient n\u00e9cessaire de recourir \u00e0 la force pour obliger quelqu\u2019un \u00e0 quitter votre \u00e9tablissement, alors il est l\u00e9gal d\u2019user de la force n\u00e9cessaire pour arriver \u00e0 cette fin. Il n\u2019est pas l\u00e9gal d\u2019user de plus de force qu\u2019il n\u2019est n\u00e9cessaire pour arriver \u00e0 cette fin. Quand une force plus que raisonnable ou n\u00e9cessaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e pour expulser l\u2019intrus, cela constitue une attaque ill\u00e9gale. C\u2019est une agression sans justification l\u00e9gale et l\u2019intrus est en droit d\u2019\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 pour l\u2019exc\u00e8s de force ainsi utilis\u00e9.\nOn soutient que le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance aurait d\u00fb dire au jury que, si le demandeur prouvait les voies de fait, il incombait alors aux d\u00e9fendeurs de prouver que cette attaque \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e ou avait \u00e9t\u00e9 commise avec excuse l\u00e9gitime et que la force appliqu\u00e9e \u00e9tait raisonnable. On s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ontario dans O\u2019Tierney v. Concord Tavern Ltd.[1], o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance avait mal instruit le jury en disant dans ses directives, au sujet d\u2019une action pour voies de fait intent\u00e9e \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019expulsion du de- mandeur d\u2019une taverne, qu\u2019il incombe au demandeur de fournir la preuve que la force appliqu\u00e9e par le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e9tait excessive.\nLe compte-rendu de la cause dit:\n[TRADUCTION] La Cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 unanime \u00e0 penser que l\u2019appel devait \u00eatre accueilli pour ce motif. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli, dans Miska v. Sivec, [1959] O.R. 144, que dans une action de cette sorte, o\u00f9 le d\u00e9fendeur plaide la justification de la force appliqu\u00e9e, le fardeau de prouver que la force appliqu\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait pas excessive dans les circonstances lui incombe.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause, le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019a pas plaid\u00e9 justification. Le demandeur, dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 de ses pr\u00e9tentions, a soutenu ce qui suit:\n[TRADUCTION] 4. Le d\u00e9fendeur Walter Balaban, employ\u00e9 comme gar\u00e7on de table au Royal Hotel, s\u2019est livr\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement \u00e0 des voies de fait graves sur la personne du demandeur, lui causant des blessures corporelles graves et douloureuses.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur, dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 de ses moyens de d\u00e9fense, a ni\u00e9 cette pr\u00e9tention.\nL\u2019avocat du demandeur, dans ses remarques pr\u00e9liminaires au jury, a expos\u00e9 comme suit ce qu\u2019il se proposait de prouver:\n[TRADUCTION] Je me propose de fournir la preuve que Warren Mann \u00e9tait un client et un habitu\u00e9 du Royal Hotel et qu\u2019il avait pris place dans la taverne de cet \u00e9tablissement, et s\u2019y \u00e9tait assis avec son amie, avec qui il vivait en concubinage. Ils vivaient ainsi depuis un an environ. Ils avaient pris l\u2019habitude de venir prendre un verre au Royal Hotel de Galt, et c\u2019est ce qu\u2019ils faisaient ce 23 d\u00e9cembre 1965.\nJe me propose de fournir la preuve qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient en discussion au sujet d\u2019un voyage que Warren Mann devait faire \u00e0 Toronto, et pour lequel Mme Mann devait avancer l\u2019argent n\u00e9cessaire. Pendant que cette discussion se poursuivait, je fournirai la preuve que M. Walter Balaban, le g\u00e9rant de la taverne, qui se tenait derri\u00e8re le comptoir, est sorti de derri\u00e8re ce comptoir, a frapp\u00e9 et jet\u00e9 \u00e0 terre M. Warren Mann.\nIl est \u00e9vident que l\u2019avocat du demandeur n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 le droit du d\u00e9fendeur d\u2019expulser le demandeur dans ces circonstances. En effet, dans ses directives, le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a dit ceci:\n[TRADUCTION] Voyez-vous, voici comment on pr\u00e9sente la chose pour le demandeur M. Mann: \u00abEh bien, disons qu\u2019il se disputait dans la taverne, admettons que son langage \u00e9tait grossier, qu\u2019il cr\u00e9ait un certain d\u00e9sordre; quand m\u00eame, en supposant que tout cela est vrai, M. Balaban aurait d\u00fb trouver moyen de lui faire \u00e9vacuer les lieux sans lui fracturer le cr\u00e2ne\u00bb.\nLa question pos\u00e9e au jury, et dont la teneur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par les avocats, \u00e9tait la suivante:\n[TRADUCTION] Le d\u00e9fendeur Balaban s\u2019est-il livr\u00e9 sans justification l\u00e9gale \u00e0 des voies de fait sur la personne du demandeur Mann?\nC\u2019est \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces circonstances que les directives au jury doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es, et cela dans leur ensemble, en fonction des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s. La pr\u00e9tention du demandeur, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve apport\u00e9e par ses t\u00e9moins, c\u2019est qu\u2019il a souffert de graves blessures en \u00e9tant projet\u00e9 violemment sur le plancher par le d\u00e9fendeur. La pr\u00e9tention du d\u00e9fendeur c\u2019est qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019attaque ayant caus\u00e9 une blessure au demandeur. Si le fait pour le d\u00e9fendeur de poser sa main sur l\u2019\u00e9paule du demandeur peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme voies de fait en droit strict, il est tr\u00e8s clair que ce geste ne pouvait pas causer et n\u2019a pas caus\u00e9 de blessure quelconque au demandeur. Selon la preuve apport\u00e9e par le d\u00e9fendeur, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par des t\u00e9moins, hors ce geste, tout ce qu\u2019a fait le d\u00e9fendeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 de retenir le demandeur, quand il s\u2019est lev\u00e9, pour pr\u00e9venir sa chute.\nLa question essentielle \u00e9tait donc claire: est-ce que le jury a admis la pr\u00e9tention du demandeur selon laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 projet\u00e9 sur le plancher, ou bien a-t-il admis celle du d\u00e9fendeur selon laquelle le demandeur n\u2019y a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 projet\u00e9.\nDans les circonstances de cette affaire, le jury n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si un certain degr\u00e9 de force \u00e9tait excessif ou non. Si le jury \u00e9tait convaincu de la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de l\u2019histoire racont\u00e9e par les t\u00e9moins du demandeur, la force employ\u00e9e \u00e9tait ind\u00e9niablement excessive. Si le jury admettait la version du d\u00e9fendeur, il n\u2019y a pas eu de voies de fait du tout. Telle \u00e9tait la situation \u00e0 la cl\u00f4ture des d\u00e9bats. Compte tenu de tous les t\u00e9moignages, la question du fardeau de la preuve n\u2019avait plus aucune importance. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019a clairement \u00e9tabli le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance, dans le passage suivant de ses motifs (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9), quand il dit:\n[TRADUCTION] Eh bien, il y a d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9 l\u2019histoire de M. Balaban qui, avec une force d\u00e9raisonnable et injustifi\u00e9e, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les pr\u00e9tentions du demandeur, soulevant ce dernier de sa chaise, et par l\u2019application d\u2019une force excessive, le faisait se retrouver sur le plancher le cr\u00e2ne fractur\u00e9.\nEt l\u2019autre tableau, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par la d\u00e9fense, est \u00e0 l\u2019effet que M. Balaban, en maintenant l\u2019ordre dans la taverne, ainsi qu\u2019il avait droit de le faire, a aid\u00e9 et \u00e9tait en train d\u2019aider le demandeur \u00e0 quitter le si\u00e8ge qu\u2019il occupait, afin qu\u2019il puisse \u00eatre expuls\u00e9 de la salle, et que ce faisant, il n\u2019a pas employ\u00e9 une force plus que raisonnable ou n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 cette fin. De plus, il avait demand\u00e9 auparavant au demandeur de sortir mais ce dernier n\u2019\u00e9tait pas sorti.\nMaintenant, c\u2019est \u00e0 vous de dire ce que vous croyez \u00e0 ce sujet. Vous avez entendu tous les t\u00e9moins sur ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 au juste.\nA mon avis, les directives au jury dans cette affaire, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des plaidoiries, des t\u00e9moignages apport\u00e9s et de l\u2019accord des parties sur la question \u00e0 poser au jury, \u00e9taient appropri\u00e9es. De plus, m\u00eame si ces directives peuvent \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es d\u2019inad\u00e9quates en ce qui concerne le fardeau de la preuve, je ne vois pas dans les circonstances de cette affaire un pr\u00e9judice s\u00e9rieux ou une erreur judiciaire au d\u00e9triment du demandeur qui permettraient d\u2019ordonner un nouveau proc\u00e8s, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de l\u2019art. 28(1) de la loi intitul\u00e9e The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 197, qui d\u00e9cr\u00e8te:\n[TRADUCTION] 28.\u2014(1) Un nouveau proc\u00e8s ne sera pas accord\u00e9 en raison de directives inexactes faites au jury, ou du rejet ou de l\u2019admission erron\u00e9s d\u2019un t\u00e9moignage ou parce que le verdict du jury n\u2019a pas port\u00e9 sur une question qu\u2019on n\u2019avait pas demand\u00e9 au juge de lui soumettre, ou en raison d\u2019aucune omission ou irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 dans le cours du proc\u00e8s, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019un pr\u00e9judice s\u00e9rieux ou une erreur judiciaire n\u2019en d\u00e9coulent.\nJe rejetterais le pourvoi, avec d\u00e9pens.\nLe jugement des Juges Hall, Spence et Pigeon a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par\nLE JUGE SPENCE\u2014Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un pourvoi \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Onta- rio, rendu le 4 mars 1968. Par cet arr\u00eat, la Cour d\u2019appel a rejet\u00e9, sans motifs \u00e9crits, un appel d\u2019un jugement prononc\u00e9 par le Juge King, le 2 f\u00e9vrier 1967. Ce jugement, par lequel le demandeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9bout\u00e9 de sa demande, a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu sur le verdict d\u2019un jury.\nL\u2019action a \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e pour dommages subis par le demandeur dans les locaux de la d\u00e9fenderesse Fersu Hotel Limited, le 23 d\u00e9cembre 1965. Dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 de ses pr\u00e9tentions, le demandeur pr\u00e9tend que le d\u00e9fendeur Walter Balaban, employ\u00e9 comme gar\u00e7on de table au Royal Hotel, s\u2019est livr\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement \u00e0 des voies de fait graves sur sa personne, lui causant de graves et douloureuses blessures. Le d\u00e9fendeur Balaban a ni\u00e9 s\u2019\u00eatre livr\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement \u00e0 des voies de fait sur la personne du demandeur et a plaid\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait agi dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions et sur les instructions de son employeur. La d\u00e9fenderesse Fersu Hotel Limited a plaid\u00e9 elle aussi que le d\u00e9fendeur Balaban ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas livr\u00e9, ill\u00e9galement, \u00e0 des voies de fait et de plus, que s\u2019il l\u2019avait fait, il n\u2019agissait pas dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions.\nL\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soutenu devant cette Cour que le litige ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi d\u00e9fini dans les conclusions des parties, le verdict du jury a simplement port\u00e9 sur une question de fait, savoir l\u2019absence de voies de fait. Cependant, quand on se reporte \u00e0 la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au proc\u00e8s, il appert clairement que la pr\u00e9tention du demandeur c\u2019est qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de voies de fait, de voies de fait ill\u00e9gales, tandis que le d\u00e9fendeur a soutenu qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait simplement de voies de fait en droit strict, qui \u00e9taient compl\u00e8tement justifi\u00e9es, et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accomplies sans aucun exc\u00e8s de force. Le d\u00e9fendeur a aussi cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 prouver que le demandeur n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9 par ces voies de fait, qu\u2019il avait subi ses blessures en tombant sur le plancher de la taverne et que cette chute avait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par son \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9 plut\u00f4t que par l\u2019acte du d\u00e9fendeur Balaban.\nLa premi\u00e8re question que le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a pos\u00e9e au jury est celle-ci:\n[TRADUCTION] Le d\u00e9fendeur Balaban s\u2019est-il livr\u00e9 sans justification l\u00e9gale \u00e0 des voies de fait sur la personne du demandeur Mann?\nLa r\u00e9ponse du jury \u00e0 cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00abNon\u00bb. D\u2019autres questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9es au jury, mais vu la r\u00e9ponse donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re, il n\u2019a pas jug\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre.\nLe pourvoi par devant cette Cour est fond\u00e9 uniquement sur une critique des directives du savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance aux membres du jury. On soutient que le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a mal instruit le jury en lui disant que le fardeau de la preuve incombait \u00e0 l\u2019appelant demandeur en premi\u00e8re instance, pour ce qui est des questions de la justification de l\u2019acte, d\u2019une excuse l\u00e9gitime et de l\u2019application d\u2019une force raisonnable. Avant de traiter en d\u00e9tail de ces directives, un expos\u00e9 succinct de quelques-uns des faits s\u2019impose.\nIl y a eu une multitude de d\u00e9positions contradictoires, mais certaines circonstances sont \u00e9tablies dans la preuve sans aucune contradiction. Le demandeur, appelant en cette Cour, est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fersu Hotel Limited, connu sous le nom de Royal Hotel, dans la ville de Galt, vers 6h. du soir, le 23 d\u00e9cembre 1965. Il n\u2019y a aucune preuve que le demandeur ait auparavant, ce jour-l\u00e0, consomm\u00e9 des boissons alcooliques. Le demandeur a jur\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne l\u2019avait pas fait. Apr\u00e8s les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui font l\u2019objet de l\u2019action, et \u00e0 une heure d\u00e9termin\u00e9e avec pr\u00e9cision par le t\u00e9moignage du constable Landry, soit entre 11h.20 et 11h.30 du soir, ce dernier vit le demandeur, assis ou \u00e9tendu contre la fa\u00e7ade du Royal Hotel, avec un gar\u00e7on de table pench\u00e9 sur lui, qui s\u2019effor\u00e7ait soit de l\u2019aider \u00e0 se remettre sur pieds, soit de le d\u00e9poser sur le trottoir. Par cons\u00e9quent, le demandeur s\u2019\u00e9tait trouv\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de la taverne, \u00e9videmment pour y consommer de la bi\u00e8re, depuis 6h. jusqu\u2019\u00e0 une minute ou deux avant 11h.20 du soir. Le demandeur a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait pris, pendant ce temps-l\u00e0, 7 ou 8 verres de bi\u00e8re en f\u00fbt, et il n\u2019est pas difficile d\u2019en d\u00e9duire que lors des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente action, il \u00e9tait dans un \u00e9tat d\u2019\u00e9bri\u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s avanc\u00e9e. Cependant, l\u2019action est uniquement pour voies de fait, et elle n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation que le d\u00e9fendeur Balaban ou la co-d\u00e9fenderesse la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 h\u00f4teli\u00e8re ont permis au demandeur de s\u2019enivrer et de se trouver incapable de se tenir debout. Le d\u00e9fendeur lui-m\u00eame, du fait de ses blessures et particuli\u00e8rement des suites d\u2019une commotion subie quand il s\u2019est frapp\u00e9 la t\u00eate contre le plancher, ne se souvient plus de rien apr\u00e8s une dispute entre lui et sa compagne, Mme Killoran, avec qui il vivait en concubinage \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque. Par cons\u00e9quent, la preuve de ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie par divers clients de la taverne, par le d\u00e9fendeur Balaban et par d\u2019autres gar\u00e7ons de table. Comme on peut s\u2019y attendre en pareille circonstance, la preuve fournie en faveur du demandeur tend \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que le d\u00e9fendeur Balaban l\u2019a frapp\u00e9 avec violence et sans raison, de sorte que le demandeur tomba \u00e0 terre, sa t\u00eate donnant durement contre le carrelage. Le t\u00e9moignage du d\u00e9fendeur Balaban, corrobor\u00e9 par celui d\u2019autres clients, est \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il a simplement touch\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9paule et les bras du demandeur, l\u2019a dress\u00e9 sur ses pieds, et ensuite l\u2019a laiss\u00e9 d\u00e9bout et s\u2019est retourn\u00e9 pour ramasser la veste du demandeur; ce dernier, en raison de son \u00e9tat d\u2019ivresse, est alors tomb\u00e9 sur le plancher en se frappant la t\u00eate. Apr\u00e8s cela, de quelque fa\u00e7on que cela se soit produit, un autre gar\u00e7on de table a simplement enlev\u00e9 le demandeur, l\u2019a plac\u00e9 sur son \u00e9paule, l\u2019a emport\u00e9 dans la rue et l\u2019a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 contre le mur. C\u2019est ce dernier geste qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9 par le constable Landry entre 11h.20 et 11h.30 du soir.\nA la lumi\u00e8re de ces faits, j\u2019entreprends l\u2019examen des directives du savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance au jury. Apr\u00e8s avoir esquiss\u00e9 l\u2019essentiel de la d\u00e9finition juridique des voies de fait, le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a dit:\n[TRADUCTION] Maintenant, dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le demandeur M. Mann dit qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement assailli par le d\u00e9fendeur M. Balaban, et qu\u2019il a subi des dommages en raison des blessures qu\u2019il a souffertes du fait de cette attaque. Pour avoir gain de cause, le demandeur doit le prouver, et il doit le prouver selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. En d\u2019autres termes, pour que le demandeur ait gain de cause, il vous faut, vous membres du jury, \u00eatre convaincus qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 vraisemblablement assailli, sans justification l\u00e9gale, par le d\u00e9fendeur M. Balaban, et que, de ce fait, il a vraisemblablement subi des dommages, et si tel est le cas, vous fixerez alors une somme qui devra indemniser raisonnablement M. Mann de ses dommages. En outre, pour que le demandeur ait gain de cause contre la d\u00e9fenderesse, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 h\u00f4teli\u00e8re, vous devez \u00eatre convaincus non seulement que M. Balaban a vraisemblablement assailli le demandeur sans justification l\u00e9gale, mais aussi qu\u2019il l\u2019a fait dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions aupr\u00e8s de la d\u00e9fenderesse, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 h\u00f4teli\u00e8re. Ainsi que je l\u2019ai dit, aux fins du pr\u00e9sent proc\u00e8s, une attaque sans justification l\u00e9gale peut se d\u00e9finir comme l\u2019application intentionnelle \u00e0 la personne du demandeur d\u2019une force ill\u00e9gale par le d\u00e9fendeur.\nApr\u00e8s avoir fait des commentaires sur certaines parties de la preuve, le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a poursuivi:\n[TRADUCTION] Pour le demandeur, naturellement, l\u2019affaire consiste en ce que M. Balaban a us\u00e9 d\u2019une force excessive dans les circonstances, que la force employ\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait pas raisonnable et \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement hors de proportion avec ce que la situation r\u00e9clamait. C\u2019est ce que le demandeur pr\u00e9tend. C\u2019est \u00e0 vous de dire si cela est vrai ou non. Voyez-vous, voici comment on pr\u00e9sente la chose pour le demandeur M. Mann: \u00abEh bien, disons qu\u2019il se disputait dans la taverne, admettons que son langage \u00e9tait grossier, qu\u2019il cr\u00e9ait un certain d\u00e9sordre; quand m\u00eame, en supposant que tout cela est vrai, M. Balaban aurait d\u00fb trouver moyen de lui faire \u00e9vacuer les lieux sans lui fracturer le cr\u00e2ne\u00bb.\nEt apr\u00e8s avoir trait\u00e9 encore de certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, fournis tant par le demandeur que par le d\u00e9fendeur, le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a ajout\u00e9:\n[TRADUCTION] Et l\u2019autre tableau, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par la d\u00e9fense, est \u00e0 l\u2019effet que M. Balaban, en maintenant l\u2019ordre dans la taverne, ainsi qu\u2019il avait droit de le faire, a aid\u00e9 et \u00e9tait en train d\u2019aider le demandeur \u00e0 quitter le si\u00e8ge qu\u2019il occupait, afin qu\u2019il puisse \u00eatre expuls\u00e9 de la salle, et que ce faisant, il n\u2019a pas employ\u00e9 une force plus que raisonnable ou n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 cette fin. De plus, il avait demand\u00e9 auparavant au demandeur de sortir mais ce dernier n\u2019\u00e9tait pas sorti.\nMaintenant, c\u2019est \u00e0 vous de dire ce que vous croyez \u00e0 ce sujet. Vous avez entendu tous les t\u00e9moins sur ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 au juste.\nIl a alors esquiss\u00e9 le droit, disant entre autres:\n[TRADUCTION] Voici ce que je tiens \u00e0 vous dire, et il s\u2019agit ici de la loi concernant l\u2019expulsion des per- sonnes. Si vous d\u00e9sirez faire quitter les lieux \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un, ordinairement aucune force n\u2019est justifi\u00e9e \u00e0 son endroit tant qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9 de quitter les lieux, et qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas eu tout loisir raisonnable de s\u2019ex\u00e9cuter. S\u2019il devient n\u00e9cessaire de recourir \u00e0 la force pour obliger quelqu\u2019un \u00e0 quitter votre \u00e9tablissement, alors il est l\u00e9gal d\u2019user de la force n\u00e9cessaire pour arriver \u00e0 cette fin. Il n\u2019est pas l\u00e9gal d\u2019user de plus de force qu\u2019il n\u2019est n\u00e9cessaire pour arriver \u00e0 cette fin. Quand une force plus que raisonnable ou n\u00e9cessaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e pour expulser l\u2019intrus, cela constitue une attaque ill\u00e9gale. C\u2019est une agression sans justification l\u00e9gale et l\u2019intrus est en droit d\u2019\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 pour l\u2019exc\u00e8s de force ainsi utilis\u00e9.\nDans une action pour voies de fait, il est \u00e9tabli, selon moi, qu\u2019il incombe au demandeur de prouver qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 attaqu\u00e9 et qu\u2019il a subi un pr\u00e9judice de ce fait. Le fardeau de la preuve de ces faits devant le jury incombe au demandeur. C\u2019est ensuite au d\u00e9fendeur d\u2019\u00e9tablir la d\u00e9fense, soit premi\u00e8rement que l\u2019attaque \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e, et deuxi\u00e8mement qu\u2019aucune force excessive ou non n\u00e9cessaire n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e. La preuve de ces faits incombe au d\u00e9fendeur.\nDans Cook c. Lewis[2], l\u2019actuel Juge en Chef de cette Cour dit, \u00e0 la page 839:\n[TRADUCTION] En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je pense que le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance s\u2019est tromp\u00e9 dans ses directives au jury en ce qui a trait au fardeau de la preuve de la n\u00e9gligence. S\u2019il est vrai que le demandeur a express\u00e9ment accus\u00e9 les d\u00e9fendeurs de n\u00e9gligence, il les a accus\u00e9s aussi d\u2019avoir tir\u00e9 sur lui, et selon moi cette action, selon l\u2019ancienne forme de plaidoirie, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 une action dite \u00abtrespass\u00bb et non \u00abcase\u00bb. A mon sens, les d\u00e9cisions recueillies et comment\u00e9es par le Juge Denman, dans Stanley v. Powell (1891), 1 Q.B.D. 86, \u00e9tablissent (sauf une exception dans le cas des accidents de la route qui ne nous concerne pas ici) la r\u00e8gle que quand un demandeur a subi un pr\u00e9judice du fait d\u2019une force directement employ\u00e9e contre lui par le d\u00e9fendeur, sa cause est \u00e9tablie par la preuve de ce fait et c\u2019est au d\u00e9fendeur qu\u2019il incombe de prouver que l\u2019acte illicite n\u2019est absolument pas de sa faute. A mon avis, Stanley v. Powell a justement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019un d\u00e9fendeur a une bonne d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une telle action s\u2019il arrive \u00e0 prouver tant l\u2019absence d\u2019intention que l\u2019absence de n\u00e9gligence de sa part. Dans Miska v. Sivec[3], le Juge d\u2019appel Morden dit, \u00e0 la page 148, en discutant du plaidoyer de l\u00e9gitime d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019une accusation de voies de fait:\n[TRADUCTION] La l\u00e9gitime d\u00e9fense est une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une accusation de voies de fait, mais seulement quand la force employ\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait pas excessive dans les circonstances. Le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la force employ\u00e9e fait partie int\u00e9grale de la d\u00e9fense, et doit \u00eatre prouv\u00e9, selon moi, par un d\u00e9fendeur plaidant \u00abson assault demesne\u00bb.\nDans une affaire relative \u00e0 des faits \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s similaires \u00e0 ceux de la pr\u00e9sente, O\u2019Tierney v. Concord Tavern Ltd.[4], \u00e0 la page 533, le Juge d\u2019appel Roach dit:\n[TRADUCTION] La Cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 unanime \u00e0 penser que l\u2019appel devait \u00eatre accueilli pour ce motif. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli, dans Miska v. Sivec, [1959] O.R. 144, que dans une action de cette sorte, o\u00f9 le d\u00e9fendeur plaide la justification de la force appliqu\u00e9e, le fardeau de prouver que la force appliqu\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait pas excessive dans les circonstances lui incombe.\nAvec respect, je suis d\u2019avis que le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 ses directives au jury conform\u00e9ment aux principes que je viens d\u2019indiquer. Quand le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a dit:\n[TRADUCTION] Maintenant, dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le demandeur M. Mann dit qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement assailli par le d\u00e9fendeur M. Balaban, et qu\u2019il a subi des dommages en raison des blessures qu\u2019il a souffertes du fait de cette attaque. Pour avoir gain de cause, le demandeur doit le prouver, et il doit le prouver selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. En d\u2019autres termes, pour que le demandeur ait gain de cause, il vous faut, vous membres du jury, \u00eatre convaincus qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 vraisemblablement assailli, sans justification l\u00e9gale, par le d\u00e9fendeur M. Balaban, et que, de ce fait, il a vraisemblablement subi des dommages, et si tel est le cas, vous fixerez alors une somme qui devra indemniser raisonnablement M. Mann de ses dommages;\nle savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance imposait au demandeur le fardeau de prouver qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de voies de fait et que l\u2019attaque n\u2019avait pas de justification l\u00e9gale. C\u2019est aux d\u00e9fendeurs qu\u2019il fallait faire porter le fardeau de prouver que l\u2019attaque avait une justification l\u00e9gale. A nouveau, dans le paragraphe traitant de la force excessive que j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 cit\u00e9, les directives du Juge portent que c\u2019est au demandeur \u00e0 prouver que la force n\u2019\u00e9tait \u00abpas raisonnable et \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement hors de proportion avec ce que la situation r\u00e9clamait\u00bb, quand elles auraient \u00e9videmment d\u00fb porter qu\u2019il incombe au d\u00e9fendeur de prouver que la force employ\u00e9e \u00e9tait raisonnable et en rapport avec ce que la situation r\u00e9clamait. A mon avis, il ne suffit pas de dire, ainsi que l\u2019a fait le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance:\n[TRADUCTION] Maintenant, c\u2019est \u00e0 vous de dire ce que vous croyez \u00e0 ce sujet. Vous avez entendu tous les t\u00e9moins sur ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 au juste;\nsans appuyer sur le fait que le fardeau de la preuve passe du demandeur au d\u00e9fendeur une fois que le demandeur a fait la preuve des voies de fait et des dommages qu\u2019il pr\u00e9tend avoir subis de ce fait. Dans une affaire comme celle-ci, o\u00f9 les t\u00e9moignages sont tr\u00e8s fortement contradictoires, le jury devait recevoir des instructions pr\u00e9cises sur la question de savoir laquelle des deux parties a la charge de prouver un fait particulier ou d\u2019\u00e9tablir un point particulier. Par cons\u00e9quent, la r\u00e9ponse du jury \u00e0 la question que j\u2019ai reproduite ci-dessus ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019effet que le demandeur n\u2019a pas fait la preuve de voies de fait, mais elle peut bien \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e plut\u00f4t comme voulant dire que le demandeur n\u2019a pas fait la preuve de voies de fait sans justification l\u00e9gale. Elle pourrait aussi refl\u00e9ter l\u2019impression erron\u00e9e du jury, d\u00e9coulant des directives du savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance, que le demandeur devait prouver qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de justification l\u00e9gale.\nPour ces motifs, je suis d\u2019accord avec l\u2019avocat de l\u2019appelant lorsqu\u2019il soutient que les directives du savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance au jury \u00e9taient d\u00e9fectueuses, et cela sur un point des plus importants.\nL\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a signal\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s les directives du Juge au jury, aucune objection \u00e0 ces directives n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e par l\u2019avocat du demandeur. Ce dernier a m\u00eame dit: [TRADUCTION] \u00abJe n\u2019ai pas d\u2019observations \u00e0 faire Monsieur le Juge; quant \u00e0 moi, vous avez donn\u00e9 de bonnes directives au jury et je n\u2019ai aucune objection \u00e0 faire\u00bb. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a donc soutenu que, dans ces circonstances, le demandeur ne saurait maintenant obtenir un nouveau proc\u00e8s. Cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintes fois consid\u00e9r\u00e9e en cette Cour et ailleurs. Dans Ristow c. Wetstein[5], le Juge Smith dit, aux pages 132 et 133:\n[TRADUCTION] Il y a eu un manquement total \u00e0 l\u2019obligation d\u2019attirer l\u2019attention du jury sur cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve, sur lequel on aurait pu convenablement fonder un verdict de n\u00e9gligence contre le conducteur, et de plus, il y a eu une directive expresse portant que le jury pouvait ne tenir aucun compte de la partie la plus essentielle de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve. C\u2019\u00e9taient l\u00e0 des directives inexactes de la part du Juge, comportant vice de proc\u00e9dure, et erreur judiciaire, en ce sens que la cause du demandeur n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 convenablement soumise au jury. Par cons\u00e9quent, un nouveau proc\u00e8s a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 bon droit ordonn\u00e9, nonobstant le fait qu\u2019aucune objection n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e contre les directives au jury.\nDans Leslie c. The Canadian Press[6], le Juge en Chef Kerwin, traitant des directives au jury par le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance dans une affaire de diffamation, dit, \u00e0 la page 874:\n[TRADUCTION]\u2026 Je suis d\u2019avis que la meilleure r\u00e8gle \u00e0 suivre, et la seule qui doive \u00eatre adopt\u00e9e, est qu\u2019il suffit que la demanderesse d\u00e9montre qu\u2019une directive inexacte peut avoir influ\u00e9 sur le verdict et non pas qu\u2019elle l\u2019a fait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Si une Cour d\u2019appel a des doutes quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si cette directive inexacte a influ\u00e9 sur le verdict ou non, il incombe alors \u00e0 l\u2019autre partie de montrer que la directive inexacte n\u2019a pas en fait influ\u00e9 sur le verdict.\nPour les motifs que je viens d\u2019\u00e9noncer, je suis d\u2019avis que la directive inexacte peut bien avoir influ\u00e9 sur le verdict et entra\u00een\u00e9 une erreur judiciaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, nonobstant le fait qu\u2019aucune objection n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par l\u2019avocat du demandeur apr\u00e8s les directives du Juge, je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir ce pourvoi et d\u2019accorder un nouveau proc\u00e8s. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 toutefois cette absence d\u2019objection, je suis d\u2019avis que le demandeur n\u2019a pas droit aux d\u00e9pens du premier proc\u00e8s. Cependant, dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ontario, le quatri\u00e8me grief d\u2019appel est comme suit:\n[TRADUCTION] 4. Le jury a re\u00e7u des directives inexactes quant \u00e0 la loi relative aux voies de fait, et aussi quant \u00e0 la loi relative aux actes dits \u00abtrespass\u00bb et quant \u00e0 l\u2019implication juridique de l\u2019usage excessif de la force.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelant a droit aux d\u00e9pens devant la Cour d\u2019appel et devant cette Cour. Les d\u00e9pens du nouveau proc\u00e8s seront \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion du juge qui y pr\u00e9sidera.

Le traitement des fractures de la m\u00e2choire comportait l\u2019insertion de broches de Kirschner, qui sortaient de la joue gauche. Le demandeur a quitt\u00e9 l\u2019h\u00f4pital huit jours apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident, et les broches de Kirschner sont rest\u00e9es dans sa joue environ quatre semaines.\nLors du proc\u00e8s, le jury a accord\u00e9 au demandeur $15,000, \u00e0 titre de dommages g\u00e9n\u00e9raux. La Cour d\u2019appel a accueilli l\u2019appel des d\u00e9fendeurs et a ordonn\u00e9 un nouveau proc\u00e8s portant sur le seul montant des dommages. La d\u00e9cision d\u2019ordonner un nouveau proc\u00e8s est motiv\u00e9e uniquement sur le fait que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance avait autoris\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sentation au jury des deux photographies du demandeur qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s sa sortie de l\u2019h\u00f4pital. La Cour d\u2019appel \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que ces photographies n\u2019avaient pas pour effet de trop impressionner le jury. Le demandeur en appela \u00e0 cette Cour.\nArr\u00eat: L\u2019appel doit \u00eatre accueilli et le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance r\u00e9tabli.\nLes Juges Judson, Hall, Spence et Pigeon: Les photographies montrent graphiquement et non pas horriblement l\u2019\u00e9tat du demandeur par suite de ses blessures et des traitements qu\u2019il a re\u00e7us dans les semaines qui ont suivi l\u2019accident. Les photographies \u00e9taient pertinentes et par cons\u00e9quent admissibles et auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre remises au jury, \u00e0 moins que leur effet nuisible ne fut tel qu\u2019elles puissent d\u00e9passer leur valeur probante. La d\u00e9cision concernant cet effet nuisible ne d\u00e9pend au fond que de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation personnelle par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance des faits particuliers \u00e0 chaque affaire.\nIl n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019intervenir dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des dommages.\nLe Juge Ritchie: Les m\u00e9decins ont donn\u00e9 une description verbale nettement pertinente et recevable des effets sur la physionomie du demandeur des blessures qu\u2019il a subies et du genre de traitement auquel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis. Cela \u00e9tant, il n\u2019y a aucun motif valable pour rejeter les photographies, qui ont eu pour effet de fournir au jury une illustration graphique de l\u2019\u00e9tat dans lequel se trouvait le demandeur pendant le cours de son traitement tel que d\u00e9crit par les m\u00e9decins.\nArr\u00eats mentionn\u00e9s: Noor Mohamed c.

Dans son arr\u00eat, la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ontario a ordonn\u00e9 un nouveau proc\u00e8s portant sur le seul montant des dommages.\nLors du proc\u00e8s, le jury avait accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant 15,000 dollars, \u00e0 titre de dommages g\u00e9n\u00e9raux.\nLe Juge d\u2019appel McGillivray, en rendant l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel, a motiv\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision d\u2019ordonner un nouveau proc\u00e8s uniquement sur le fait que le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance avait autoris\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sentation au jury de deux photographies de l\u2019appelant, qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 produites au proc\u00e8s et retenues comme pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 conviction et que, naturellement, les membres du jury avaient emport\u00e9es lorsqu\u2019ils se sont retir\u00e9s pour d\u00e9lib\u00e9rer.\nL\u2019accident a eu lieu le 9 septembre 1966, et l\u2019appelant a subi des blessures dont mention sera faite ci\u2011apr\u00e8s. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9 du lieu de l\u2019accident jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital de Listowel, et le m\u00eame jour de cet h\u00f4pital jusqu\u2019au Victoria Hospital \u00e0 London. La m\u00eame nuit, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 op\u00e9r\u00e9 et ses fractures de la m\u00e2choire et de l\u2019os malaire, de m\u00eame que ses diverses d\u00e9chirures, ont fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un traitement chirurgical. Le traitement chirurgical des fractures de la m\u00e2choire comporta naturellement l\u2019insertion de broches de Kirschner, qui sortaient de la joue gauche. L\u2019appelant a quitt\u00e9 l\u2019h\u00f4pital le 17 septembre, soit huit jours apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident, et les broches de Kirschner sont rest\u00e9es dans sa joue environ quatre semaines. C\u2019est pendant cette p\u00e9riode de quatre semaines que les deux photographies de l\u2019appelant ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises. Son avocat demanda \u00e0 les produire comme pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 conviction au cours de l\u2019interrogatoire principal de son t\u00e9moin, le Dr R.W. Granger, qui avait men\u00e9 \u00e0 bonne fin le traitement. L\u2019avocat des intim\u00e9s fit objection et apr\u00e8s un d\u00e9bat assez long la Cour d\u00e9cida que les photographies pouvaient \u00eatre produites et invoqu\u00e9es \u00e0 titre de preuve. Au cours de l\u2019argumentation des avocats, le Juge Grant fit observer:\n[TRADUCTION] MONSIEUR LE JUGE: Ce genre de broche est si courant que je me demande si la plupart des membres du jury n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu ce type d\u2019appareil retenant les dents dans le visage de quelqu\u2019un. Je le con\u00e7ois parfaitement sans les photographies et je le concevrais parfaitement sans elles. Le visage ne d\u00e9gage dans la photographie aucun signe de grande douleur ou de souffrance, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0.\nM. LERNER: Je pensais avoir quelque chose dans mes notes, mais je n\u2019ai rien.\nMONSIEUR LE JUGE: A mon avis, cela d\u00e9pend dans une large mesure de la question de savoir si elles ont tendance \u00e0 trop impressionner le jury. Les radiographies ne sont pas admises du fait de leur caract\u00e8re technique et du grand risque qu\u2019elles soient mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es. Ce facteur n\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent ici.\n* * *\nMONSIEUR LE JUGE: Je ne pense pas que ces photographies soient choquantes, en ce sens qu\u2019elles risquent de trop impressionner le jury. Je dirais plut\u00f4t, \u00e0 la mine de la personne photographi\u00e9e, qu\u2019elles ne d\u00e9notent aucun signe de douleur ou de souffrance \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Je pense, Monsieur McKenzie, que vous obtiendriez de meilleurs r\u00e9sultats avec une preuve orale, mais c\u2019est \u00e0 vous de d\u00e9cider. Je n\u2019incline pas \u00e0 vous emp\u00eacher de verser ces photographies au dossier. Vous pouvez le faire, si vous le d\u00e9sirez. S\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait que de photographies des broches, je dirais non, car elles n\u2019ajoutent pratiquement rien \u00e0 ce que le m\u00e9decin vient de dire, mais il est tr\u00e8s difficile au m\u00e9decin d\u2019expliquer exactement l\u2019\u00e9tat de la cicatrice \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, et c\u2019est pour cette raison que je permets la production des photographies, si vous pouvez pr\u00e9ciser la date \u00e0 laquelle elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises. Je suppose que le photographe n\u2019est pas ici, n\u2019est-ce pas? Le jury, apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre retir\u00e9 pour d\u00e9lib\u00e9rer, est revenu \u00e0 la salle d\u2019audience pour poser la question suivante:\n[TRADUCTION] LE CHEF DU JURY: Monsieur le Juge, certains membres du jury ont demand\u00e9 dans quelle mesure nous devons consid\u00e9rer l\u2019avenir. Je ne tenais compte que de l\u2019\u00e9tat actuel de ces hommes, mais devons-nous envisager l\u2019avenir? Tout ce qui pourra se produire dans l\u2019avenir, ou devons-nous nous limiter au moment pr\u00e9cis?\nA quoi le Juge r\u00e9pondit:\n[TRADUCTION] MONSIEUR LE JUGE: Si, selon vous la preuve indique que l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre de ces hommes subira des dommages dans l\u2019avenir par suite des blessures re\u00e7ues, vous avez le droit et le devoir d\u2019en tenir compte.\nAinsi que je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, le jury estima les dommages g\u00e9n\u00e9raux \u00e0 $15,000. Le Juge d\u2019appel McGillivray de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ontario a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des motifs de son jugement:\n[TRADUCTION] Je suis enti\u00e8rement d\u2019accord avec le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance quand il dit que les photographies des broches n\u2019ajoutent rien au t\u00e9moignage d\u00e9taill\u00e9 et clair des t\u00e9moins m\u00e9dicaux, qu\u2019est venu compl\u00e9ter le t\u00e9moignage d\u00e9taill\u00e9 et clair du demandeur lui-m\u00eame. Mais je ne suis pas d\u2019accord avec lui quand il dit croire que la plupart des jur\u00e9s du comt\u00e9 de Bruce pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 ce proc\u00e8s, ou m\u00eame n\u2019importe qui d\u2019autre, ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 observ\u00e9 des gens avec des broches comme celles-l\u00e0, recouvertes de bouchons de li\u00e8ge \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 qui sort du visage. Je suis convaincu qu\u2019un pareil spectacle peut bouleverser beaucoup de gens. Je pense aussi qu\u2019un profane, mis en face de ces photographies, risque de se faire une fausse id\u00e9e de l\u2019intensit\u00e9 de la douleur ou souffrance provoqu\u00e9e par le traitement qu\u2019elles d\u00e9montrent, et peut cons\u00e9quemment oublier ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli par la preuve. Je trouve que ces photos sont \u00e9vocatrices, et j\u2019aborde donc la question de savoir si, nonobstant ce fait, leur production \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9e aux fins de donner une meilleure explication de la preuve ou \u00e0 titre de compl\u00e9ment n\u00e9cessaire.\nIl arrive souvent qu\u2019un juge, pr\u00e9sidant un proc\u00e8s par jury, soit appel\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve, quoique recevable en soi, peut porter un tel pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019adversaire que sa valeur probante en est annul\u00e9e par le pr\u00e9judice possible et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il doit en refuser la production. Pour ce qui est des photographies, la situation se pr\u00e9sente tr\u00e8s fr\u00e9quemment \u00e0 l\u2019occasion des proc\u00e8s criminels, surtout au cas d\u2019homicide. Cette question pr\u00e9sente toujours des difficult\u00e9s pour le juge de premi\u00e8re instance et elle devient essentiellement une affaire de judicieuse discr\u00e9tion personnelle.\nIl n\u2019y a aucun doute, dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, que ces deux photographies \u00e9taient pertinentes et par cons\u00e9quent admissibles. Elles montrent graphiquement et non pas horriblement, \u00e0 mon avis, l\u2019\u00e9tat du demandeur par suite de ses blessures et des traitements qu\u2019il a re\u00e7us dans les semaines qui ont suivi l\u2019accident. Le chirurgien a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 qu\u2019il trouvait difficile de d\u00e9crire en paroles l\u2019aspect de l\u2019appelant. On a fait mention, au cours du proc\u00e8s, de la valeur probante des photographies, qui montraient l\u2019\u00e9tat de la cicatrice \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, et le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il comprenait parfaitement, sans elles, le traitement et le genre de broches utilis\u00e9es. La question, naturellement, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de savoir si le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance pouvait comprendre le traitement et le genre de broches, mais bien si les jur\u00e9s le pouvaient. S\u2019il y avait un document photographique quelconque qui pouvait illustrer le traitement sans toutefois \u00eatre trop pr\u00e9judiciable dans ses effets, il fallait alors le mettre \u00e0 la disposition du jury. Dans cette affaire, l\u2019appelant avait droit \u00e0 des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats non seulement \u00e0 cause de ses souffrances, de ses douleurs, et de toute incapacit\u00e9 future mais encore, du moins en partie, pour \u00eatre rest\u00e9 pendant assez longtemps avec ces broches visibles dont les bouts recouverts de gros bouchons de li\u00e8ge lui sortaient du c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche du visage. Il a d\u00fb supporter tous les malaises qui en r\u00e9sultaient par exemple, en essayant de dormir, dans tout contact possible avec son visage, m\u00eame en se rasant, et de bien d\u2019autres fa\u00e7ons. De plus, ainsi que l\u2019a signal\u00e9 le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance, les photo- graphies montraient avec pr\u00e9cision les cicatrices telles qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Ces cicatrices \u00e9taient aussi visibles pour tous que pour l\u2019appareil photographique et le fait qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient ainsi visibles depuis le moment o\u00f9 elles apparurent, est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment du pr\u00e9judice que l\u2019appelant avait droit de faire appr\u00e9cier par le jury.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, je suis d\u2019avis que les photographies \u00e9taient recevables et qu\u2019elles devaient \u00eatre remises au jury, \u00e0 moins que leur effet nuisible ne f\u00fbt tel qu\u2019il puisse d\u00e9passer leur valeur probante.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s la citation donn\u00e9e plus haut, le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance pensait que ces broches de Kirschner \u00e9taient maintenant si communes que la plupart des membres du jury avaient d\u00fb d\u00e9j\u00e0 en voir sur le visage de quelqu\u2019un. Il \u00e9tait d\u2019avis qu\u2019elles n\u2019auraient pas pour effet de trop impressionner le jury. Le Juge d\u2019appel McGillivray, dans ses motifs de jugement, que j\u2019ai cit\u00e9s ci-haut en partie, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de cette opinion et se disait convaincu que pareil spectacle pouvait bouleverser beaucoup de gens. En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je suis d\u2019avis que la d\u00e9cision sur ce qui peut ou ne peut pas bouleverser les membres du jury, ou ne pas les choquer, est essentiellement du ressort du Juge de premi\u00e8re instance qui si\u00e8ge \u00e0 l\u2019audience avec eux, leur donne ses directives et peut appr\u00e9cier leurs r\u00e9actions. J\u2019h\u00e9siterais longtemps avant d\u2019exprimer \u00e0 ce sujet une opinion contraire \u00e0 celle du Juge de premi\u00e8re instance.\nTr\u00e8s peu de causes canadiennes ou d\u2019un pays du Commonwealth traitent de la production de tels documents dans les proc\u00e8s par jury.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 en a cit\u00e9 seulement deux, et mes recherches n\u2019ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu\u2019un tr\u00e8s petit nombre d\u2019autres exemples. Je pense que la raison de ce manque de pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents est \u00e9vidente. La d\u00e9cision ne doit d\u00e9pendre au fond que de l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation personnelle par le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance des faits particuliers \u00e0 chaque affaire. Ce point de vue me para\u00eet confirm\u00e9 par ce que l\u2019on retrouve dans les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents. Dans Noor Mohamed v. The King[2], lord Du Parcq dit, \u00e0 la page 192 au sujet de la preuve d\u2019autres crimes auxquels l\u2019inculp\u00e9 aurait particip\u00e9:\n[TRADUCTION] Il convient d\u2019ajouter toutefois que dans tous les cas de ce genre, le juge doit voir si la preuve que l\u2019on veut pr\u00e9senter est assez concluante, par rapport au but vis\u00e9 ouvertement par sa pr\u00e9sentation, pour qu\u2019il soit convenable de la recevoir dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice. Le juge a raison de la rejeter, si sa valeur probante est insignifiante eu \u00e9gard au but vis\u00e9 et aux circonstances de l\u2019affaire. En disant cela, on ne confond pas la valeur probante avec la recevabilit\u00e9. La distinction est \u00e9vidente, mais des cas doivent cependant se pr\u00e9senter o\u00f9 il serait injuste d\u2019accepter un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve de caract\u00e8re fortement nuisible \u00e0 l\u2019accus\u00e9, bien qu\u2019il puisse y avoir quelque faible raison de soutenir qu\u2019il est recevable en soi. La d\u00e9cision doit alors \u00eatre laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion du juge et \u00e0 son sens de la justice.\n(Les italiques sont de moi.)\nDans Gray v. LaFl\u00e8che[3], le Juge en Chef Williams, de la Cour du banc de la reine dit, \u00e0 la page 349, en consid\u00e9rant si le membre bless\u00e9 du demandeur devait \u00eatre montr\u00e9 au jury dans un proc\u00e8s par jury:\n[TRADUCTION] Quand, dans un proc\u00e8s par jury, le demandeur invoque la r\u00e8gle \u00e9tablie dans Sornberger v. C.P.R. (1897), 24 O.A.R. 263, d\u2019autres consid\u00e9rations doivent jouer. Ainsi que l\u2019a signal\u00e9 le chancelier Boyd, il est enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance d\u2019autoriser ou non la pratique approuv\u00e9e dans cette affaire-l\u00e0.\nDans Rex v. O\u2019Donnell[4], lors de poursuites pour un homicide commis pendant un viol, une objection avait \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e, devant la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ontario, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la production au proc\u00e8s de certaines photographies du corps de la victime, pour le motif qu\u2019elles auraient pr\u00e9dispos\u00e9 le jury contre l\u2019accus\u00e9. Le Juge en Chef Mulock de l\u2019Ontario rejeta toutes les objections dans une courte d\u00e9claration:\n[TRADUCTION] Les photographies en question ont eu pour but utile de corroborer les t\u00e9moignages relatifs au traitement inflig\u00e9 \u00e0 Ruth Taylor par son assaillant. Il est impensable que ces photographies puissent avoir pr\u00e9dispos\u00e9 le jury contre l\u2019accus\u00e9. Ce motif d\u2019appel doit donc \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nLe Juge Masten, \u00e0 la page 532, rejette toute consid\u00e9ration de pr\u00e9judice; il lui suffit que les photographies soient recevables.\nDans Regina v. Creemer and Cormier[5], le Juge d\u2019appel McKinnon dit aux pages 154-155:\n[TRADUCTION] A mon avis, le motif n\u00b0 1 de l\u2019avis d\u2019appel n\u2019est pas soutenable. Des photographies attest\u00e9es sous serment par une personne qui peut attester leur v\u00e9racit\u00e9 sont recevables: Regina v. Toison (1864) 4 F. & F. 103, 176 E.R. 488. Au Canada, des photographies repr\u00e9sentant les restes carbonis\u00e9s d\u2019une personne assassin\u00e9e tels qu\u2019ils apparaissaient au moment de l\u2019autopsie ont \u00e9t\u00e9 admises en preuve: Rex v. Arthur Bannister, 10 M.P.R. 391, 66 C.C.C. 38, [1936] 2 D.L.R. 795. Et des photographies du cadavre d\u2019une femme trouv\u00e9e assassin\u00e9e, tel qu\u2019il paraissait sur le lieu du crime, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues recevables contre la personne accus\u00e9e du crime: Rex v. O\u2019Donnell 65 C.C.C. 299, [1936] 2 D.L.R. 517.\nTous les arr\u00eats traitant de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des photographies tendent \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que cette admissibilit\u00e9 d\u00e9pend: (1) de leur pr\u00e9cision dans la repr\u00e9sentation exacte des faits; (2) de leur justesse et de l\u2019absence de toute intention d\u2019induire en erreur; (3) de leur attestation sous serment par une personne comp\u00e9tente. La photographie mise en question ici, ainsi que d\u2019autres, a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par l\u2019agent Sulewiski, de la G.R.C., qui s\u2019occupe depuis quatre ans et demi de photographie, d\u2019empreintes digitales et de disciplines connexes. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la photo en couleur dont il s\u2019agit ici repr\u00e9sente fid\u00e8lement la sc\u00e8ne telle qu\u2019il l\u2019a vue. La d\u00e9fense ne pr\u00e9tend pas que cette photographie n\u2019est pas fid\u00e8le ou qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite en vue d\u2019induire en erreur, mais bien qu\u2019elle avait pour but de provoquer une r\u00e9action de sympathie. Pour les raisons donn\u00e9es, je dois rejeter le motif n\u00b0 1 de l\u2019appel.\nLe m\u00eame point de vue a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 par le Juge en Chef Baxter dans Rex v. Bannister[6], et \u00e0 nouveau dans R. v. O\u2019Leary[7]. Bien que, comme le Juge d\u2019appel McKinnon l\u2019a signal\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire Creemer, les photos produites montraient des sc\u00e8nes que l\u2019on peut qualifier d\u2019horribles, leur effet pr\u00e9judiciable n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme faisant obstacle \u00e0 leur recevabilit\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par ailleurs. Il se peut bien que cette opinion soit trop rigide, et qu\u2019elle ne tienne pas compte de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de mettre en balance la valeur probante et l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable.\nDans Green v. The King[8], le Juge en Chef Latham dit \u00e0 la page 172:\n[TRADUCTION] On \u00e9l\u00e8ve l\u2019objection que certaines photographies montrant le corps des femmes assassin\u00e9es \u00e9taient irrecevables en preuve et qu\u2019elles n\u2019auraient pas d\u00fb \u00eatre montr\u00e9es au jury, et que certains t\u00e9moignages donn\u00e9s par le t\u00e9moin (Mme) Brannigan, et un autre t\u00e9moin, M. Hewat, \u00e9taient aussi irrecevables. Je ne vois aucune raison valable de soutenir qu\u2019aucune partie de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9tait irrecevable. Il n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait \u00e9tat d\u2019aucun principe juridique en vertu duquel les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en question auraient pu \u00eatre exclus.\nDans The King v. Cartman[9], le Juge Fair a tranch\u00e9 une objection soulev\u00e9e au proc\u00e8s relativement \u00e0 la production de certaines photographies. Le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance avait dit, \u00e0 la page 728:\n[TRADUCTION] La poursuite pr\u00e9tend que chaque photographie est n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation aussi claire que possible de la preuve de l\u2019accusation. Elle dit que les diff\u00e9rentes photographies ne traitent pas le m\u00eame aspect de la question, en ce sens qu\u2019elles ne repr\u00e9sentent pas les m\u00eames faits mat\u00e9riels, et que les faits ne pourraient \u00eatre aussi pleinement expliqu\u00e9s au jury qu\u2019il se doit si toutes les photographies ne pouvaient \u00eatre produites.\nAinsi, \u00e0 supposer que le caract\u00e8re et le nombre des photographies puissent exercer un effet pr\u00e9judiciable sur les membres du jury, il semble qu\u2019elles ne puissent pas \u00eatre exclues, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 leur grande valeur probante.\nMais, en avan\u00e7ant ceci, je n\u2019affirme pas que la pr\u00e9sentation des photographies aura un effet nuisible \u00e0 l\u2019impartialit\u00e9 du jugement du jury. Les circonstances dans lesquelles le cadavre de cette pauvre femme a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 sont horribles, et les photographies reproduisent ces circonstances r\u00e9voltantes. Mais je pense que les jur\u00e9s eux-m\u00eames sauront distinguer le but dans lequel ces photographies sont produites en preuve de l\u2019impression qu\u2019elles peuvent donner \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue. Dans la suite des d\u00e9bats, ils regarderont les photographies comme un moyen de preuve ordinaire et convenable, \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration uniquement en fonction des faits qu\u2019elles prouvent.\nJ\u2019estime par cons\u00e9quent que toutes les photographies sont recevables, qu\u2019elles doivent l\u2019\u00eatre, et qu\u2019aucune d\u2019elles ne doit amener la Cour \u00e0 sugg\u00e9rer \u00e0 la Couronne de ne pas les offrir en preuve.\nComme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, le Juge d\u2019appel McGillivray a fond\u00e9 ses motifs d\u2019ordonner un nouveau proc\u00e8s sur la remise de ces deux photographies au jury. Il a cependant ajout\u00e9:\n[TRADUCTION] En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence envers le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance, je consid\u00e8re que les photographies en question n\u2019avaient aucune valeur probante. Leur production n\u2019a pas aid\u00e9 les jur\u00e9s dans leurs d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations, mais peut facilement avoir d\u00e9form\u00e9 dans leur esprit l\u2019\u00e9tendue des dommages \u00e0 \u00e9valuer, d\u2019autant plus que c\u2019\u00e9taient les seules photographies qu\u2019ils avaient en main dans la salle des d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations. Que la chose se soit produite en fait, j\u2019en vois la preuve dans le montant accord\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de dommages g\u00e9n\u00e9raux. Sans vouloir diminuer en quoi que ce soit la gravit\u00e9 des blessures re\u00e7ues par le demandeur, quand on note la courte p\u00e9riode d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 aussi bien que son r\u00e9tablissement remarquable, les dommages g\u00e9n\u00e9raux qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s d\u00e9passent consid\u00e9rablement, j\u2019en suis convaincu, l\u2019indemnisation justifi\u00e9e par la preuve.\n\u00c9videmment, le Juge d\u2019appel McGillivray s\u2019est bien rendu compte que l\u2019opinion de la Cour d\u2019appel, \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les dommages accord\u00e9s \u00abd\u00e9passent consid\u00e9rablement l\u2019indemnisation justifi\u00e9e par la preuve\u00bb, ne suffisait pas \u00e0 elle seule pour la justifier d\u2019\u00e9carter le verdict du jury. M\u00eame si les dommages avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s par un juge sans l\u2019aide d\u2019un jury, ils n\u2019auraient pu \u00eatre modi- fi\u00e9s par le tribunal d\u2019appel, \u00e0 part une erreur de droit, que [TRADUCTION] \u00absi le montant accord\u00e9 est si excessivement bas ou si excessivement \u00e9lev\u00e9 qu\u2019il doit constituer une estimation enti\u00e8rement fausse des dommages\u00bb (Nance v. British Columbia Railway Company[10], le vicomte Simon \u00e0 la page 613). Ce principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9 et adopt\u00e9 par cette Cour dans bon nombre d\u2019affaires: Fagnan c. Ure et autres[11]; Widrig c. Strazer et autres[12]; Gorman c. Hertz Drive Yourself Stations of Ontario Ltd. et autres[13].\nEn outre, dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l\u2019\u00e9valuation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par un jury. Le vicomte Simon, dans l\u2019affaire Nance, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, poursuivait:\n[TRADUCTION] La derni\u00e8re affaire cit\u00e9e montre, de plus, que lorsque le montant est fix\u00e9 par un jury convenablement instruit, la diff\u00e9rence entre le chiffre auquel il est arriv\u00e9 et celui auquel il aurait pu convenablement arriver doit, pour justifier une modification par une cour d\u2019appel, \u00eatre encore plus grande que dans le cas o\u00f9 ce m\u00eame chiffre aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 par un juge seul. Le montant doit \u00eatre tout \u00e0 fait \u00abhors de toute proportion\u00bb (lord Wright, Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, Ltd., [1942] A.C. 601, 616).\nLe Juge d\u2019appel McGillivray a d\u00e9crit comme suit les blessures de l\u2019appelant et le traitement appliqu\u00e9, ainsi que son \u00e9tat physique lors du proc\u00e8s et les pronostics:\n[TRADUCTION] Le demandeur a subi des blessures dans un accident d\u2019automobile survenu le 9 septembre 1966. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 gravement bless\u00e9 au visage et \u00e0 la t\u00eate, et moins gravement au genou droit, au c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit de sa poitrine et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9paule gauche. En termes plus pr\u00e9cis, il avait une longue d\u00e9chirure irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re \u00e0 la partie gauche du visage, une d\u00e9chirure de la paroi int\u00e9rieure de la bouche, avec des fractures compliqu\u00e9es s\u2019\u00e9tendant de sous l\u2019\u0153il droit, \u00e0 travers l\u2019ar\u00eate du nez, passant sous l\u2019\u0153il gauche jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019os malaire gauche, d\u00e9crites comme un maxillaire flot- tant; il avait la m\u00e2choire sup\u00e9rieure d\u00e9plac\u00e9e vers le bas et vers l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur, toute la configuration du visage d\u00e9form\u00e9e, et il avait trois fractures de la m\u00e2choire inf\u00e9rieure avec d\u00e9placement.\nAu moment de l\u2019accident, le demandeur \u00e9tait en train de se faire enlever toutes les dents sauf neuf. Suite au traitement appliqu\u00e9 apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident, ces neuf dents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 atteintes et on dit qu\u2019elles devront aussi \u00eatre enlev\u00e9es.\nLe demandeur a subi une commotion mineure au moment de l\u2019accident. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital de Listowel, puis transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital Victoria \u00e0 London. Il fait peu de doute que ses douleurs \u00e9taient grandes pendant cette p\u00e9riode. A London, sous anesth\u00e9sie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ses os faciaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remis en place aussi exactement que possible et maintenus en position au moyen de deux broches de Kirschner qui lui sortaient du visage. Des fils fins ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9s \u00e0 travers les gencives, \u00e0 la base des dents sup\u00e9rieures et des dents inf\u00e9rieures, pour relier les m\u00e2choires. Plusieurs morceaux de verre ont \u00e9t\u00e9 extirp\u00e9s de sa joue gauche, et on lui a fait plusieurs points de suture dans la joue. Ces points ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9s sept jours apr\u00e8s.\nLe r\u00e9tablissement du demandeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 tout \u00e0 fait rapide, \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer la gravit\u00e9 de ses blessures. Apr\u00e8s quatre jours il pouvait marcher, et huit jours apr\u00e8s son entr\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital il a \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 rentrer chez lui. Deux semaines apr\u00e8s sa sortie de l\u2019h\u00f4pital, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 par le Dr Grainer (sic), et de nouveau quatre semaines apr\u00e8s avoir quitt\u00e9 l\u2019h\u00f4pital, alors que furent enlev\u00e9es les broches de Kirschner. Deux semaines plus tard, soit six semaines apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 une troisi\u00e8me fois et on lui a enlev\u00e9 les fils m\u00e9talliques autour des dents. Apr\u00e8s cela, il n\u2019a plus eu besoin de soins m\u00e9dicaux et n\u2019en a jamais demand\u00e9. Il est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 son travail neuf semaines apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident et ne s\u2019en est plus absent\u00e9.\nAu moment du proc\u00e8s, le 20 mars 1961, les neuf dents de devant du demandeur n\u2019avaient pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 extraites. Il avait une cicatrice longue de quelques deux pouces qui s\u2019\u00e9tendait du coin de sa bouche vers la joue gauche. On a dit qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019une apparence affreuse et bien que visible \u00e0 une distance de 12 ou 14 pieds, elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas facilement discernable \u00e0 20 pieds. D\u2019autres cicatrices plus petites n\u2019\u00e9taient vraiment pas tr\u00e8s visibles. Il avait le plein usage des muscles de son visage. Il s\u2019est plaint d\u2019\u00e9prouver quelque difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 avaler mais son chirurgien, qui l\u2019avait examin\u00e9 avant le proc\u00e8s, n\u2019a rien pu trouv\u00e9 dans la bouche du demandeur qui puisse expliquer ce mal. Le demandeur souffrait \u00e9galement d\u2019engourdissement \u00e0 deux petits endroits de son visage. Il affirma \u00e9prouver une douleur continuelle \u00e0 la joue gauche, douleur qui devenait aigu\u00eb quand il y avait du vent ou par temps froid. En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, son r\u00e9tablissement des graves blessures faciales re\u00e7ues a \u00e9t\u00e9 rapide et remarquablement complet. Il \u00e9tait aussi assez manifeste qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 prolonger sa convalescence et qu\u2019il est retourn\u00e9 promptement au travail.\nIl est difficile de qualifier la somme de $15,000 accord\u00e9e par le jury, pour les blessures et incapacit\u00e9s d\u00e9crites par le savant Juge d\u2019appel d\u2019\u00abexcessivement \u00e9lev\u00e9es\u00bb, encore moins de \u00abhors de toute proportion\u00bb. Je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas lieu d\u2019intervenir dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des dommages en d\u00e9coulant. D\u2019ailleurs, m\u00eame si je pensais que les photographies ont \u00e9t\u00e9 erron\u00e9ment admises, je dirais que l\u2019appelant dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, intim\u00e9 devant la Cour d\u2019appel, aurait eu, par devant ladite Cour, un motif des plus convaincants pour l\u2019application de l\u2019art. 28(1) de la loi intitul\u00e9e The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 197, qui d\u00e9cr\u00e8te:\n[TRADUCTION] Un nouveau proc\u00e8s ne sera pas ordonn\u00e9 en raison de directives inexactes au jury ou du rejet ou de l\u2019admission erron\u00e9s d\u2019un t\u00e9moignage ou parce que le verdict du jury n\u2019a pas port\u00e9 sur une question qu\u2019on n\u2019avait pas demand\u00e9 au juge de lui soumettre, ou en raison d\u2019aucune omission ou irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 dans le cours du proc\u00e8s, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019un pr\u00e9judice s\u00e9rieux ou une erreur judiciaire n\u2019en d\u00e9coulent;\net il aurait bien pu soutenir que l\u2019appel devant ladite Cour devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9.\nJe suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi, d\u2019infirmer l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ontario, et de r\u00e9tablir le jugement du Juge Grant. L\u2019appelant a droit \u00e0 ses frais en cette Cour et en la Cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ontario. LE JUGE RITCHIE\u2014J\u2019ai eu l\u2019avantage de lire les motifs de jugement r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par mon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Spence, et conviens avec lui que l\u2019appel doit \u00eatre accueilli; cependant, comme je suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion pour des motifs un peu diff\u00e9rents, je d\u00e9sire exprimer s\u00e9par\u00e9ment mes vues sur le sujet.\nLe pr\u00e9sent pourvoi est limit\u00e9 \u00e0 la question du montant des dommages g\u00e9n\u00e9raux que le jury aurait d\u00fb accorder \u00e0 l\u2019appelant pour les blessures subies. Je suis d\u2019avis que les m\u00e9decins ont donn\u00e9 une description verbale nettement pertinente et recevable des effets sur la physionomie de l\u2019appelant des blessures qu\u2019il a subies et du genre de traitement auquel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis. Cela \u00e9tant, je ne vois aucun motif valable pour rejeter les photographies mises en question, qui ont eu pour effet de fournir au jury une illustration graphique de l\u2019\u00e9tat dans lequel se trouvait l\u2019appelant pendant le cours de son traitement tel que d\u00e9crit par les m\u00e9decins.\nMon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Spence s\u2019est report\u00e9 au jugement du Juge en Chef Williams de la Cour du banc de la reine, dans Gray v. LaFl\u00e8che[14], et aux affaires qui y sont cit\u00e9es. Dans cette affairel\u00e0, le Juge en Chef Williams a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019un demandeur en dommages pour blessures corporelles, dans une action pour faute professionnelle, n\u2019est pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 montrer au jury des parties bless\u00e9es du corps qui ne sont pas ordinairement expos\u00e9es \u00e0 la vue, sauf toutefois qu\u2019il est laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation du Juge de premi\u00e8re instance de d\u00e9cider si de telles parties peuvent \u00eatre exhib\u00e9es en vue de permettre \u00e0 des t\u00e9moins m\u00e9dicaux d\u2019expliquer la nature et l\u2019\u00e9tendue des blessures. \u00c0 mon sens, il y a une distinction nette \u00e0 faire entre le fait d\u2019exposer des parties bless\u00e9es du corps dans le seul but de les montrer au jury, et celui de produire des photographies prises dans le cours du traitement m\u00e9dical appliqu\u00e9 aux blessures re\u00e7ues. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, les photographies servent \u00e0 illustrer la nature du traitement re\u00e7u par l\u2019appelant, et \u00e0 ce point de vue, elles font partie de la description de sa maladie et de sa convalescence et sont \u00e0 la fois pertinentes et recevables.\nIl y a des cas o\u00f9 des photographies pertinentes peuvent n\u00e9anmoins \u00eatre exclues de la preuve, \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion du juge de premi\u00e8re instance, pour le motif qu\u2019elles sont trop \u00e9vocatrices, mais rien dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire ne permet d\u2019\u00e9tablir que le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a fait erreur en ne rejetant pas les photographies pour ce motif.\nMon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Spence s\u2019est aussi report\u00e9 \u00e0 un certain nombre d\u2019affaires criminelles dans lesquelles des photos ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produites qui repr\u00e9sentaient l\u2019\u00e9tat de la victime apr\u00e8s un meurtre ou des voies de faits. Dans certaines de ces affaires, le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance a exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour refuser leur production comme \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, pour le motif qu\u2019elles avaient une valeur probante n\u00e9gligeable et qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient pr\u00e9judiciables \u00e0 l\u2019inculp\u00e9. Dans les affaires criminelles, o\u00f9 la seule question est la culpabilit\u00e9 ou l\u2019innocence de l\u2019inculp\u00e9, il est normal que la production de telles photographies soit refus\u00e9e \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il ne soit \u00e9tabli qu\u2019elles constituent une preuve reliant directement l\u2019inculp\u00e9 avec le crime dont il est accus\u00e9, mais une telle question ne se pose pas dans le cas pr\u00e9sent o\u00f9 la seule d\u00e9cision \u00e0 prendre a trait au montant des dommages que le jury a accord\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appelant pour les blessures subies. Les photographies repr\u00e9sentant l\u2019\u00e9tat de ces blessures au moment o\u00f9 l\u2019appelant recevait un traitement m\u00e9dical sont en relation directe avec cette d\u00e9cision et sont par cons\u00e9quent recevables.\nJe conviens avec mon coll\u00e8gue le Juge Spence que les dommages de $15,000 accord\u00e9s par le savant Juge de premi\u00e8re instance dans cette affaire ne peuvent \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9s d\u2019excessivement \u00e9lev\u00e9s et cons\u00e9quemment je suis d\u2019avis d\u2019accueillir le pourvoi avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppel accueilli avec d\u00e9pens.\nProcureurs du demandeur, appelant: Shepherd, McKenzie, Plaxton, Little & Jenkins, London.\nProcureurs des d\u00e9fendeurs, intim\u00e9s: Lerner, Lerner, Bradley, Cherniak & Granger, London.\n[1] [1968] 2 O.R. 683, 70 D.L.R.
