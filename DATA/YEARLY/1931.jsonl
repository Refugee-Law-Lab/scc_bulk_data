The questions referred to the Court were as follows:\n1. Upon Rupert\u2019s Land and the North-Western Territory being admitted into and becoming a part of the Dominion of Canada under Order in Council of June 23rd, 1870, were all lands then vested in the Crown and now lying within the boundaries of the Province of Saskatchewan vested in the Crown:\u2014\n(a) in the right of the Dominion of Canada, or\n(b) in the right of any province or provinces to be established within such area, or\n(c) to be administered for any province or provinces to be established within such area, or\n(d) to be administered for the benefit of the inhabitants from time to time of such area?\n2. Is the Dominion of Canada under obligation to account to the Province of Saskatchewan for any lands within its boundaries alienated by the Dominion of Canada prior to September 1st, 1905?\n(By admission, throughout the said questions the term \u201clands\u201d means and includes \u201clands, mines, minerals and royalties incident thereto\u201d).\nC.

Chrysler K.C. for the Attorney General for Manitoba.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The Governor General in Council, by a minute approved on 3rd May, 1930, submits two questions for hearing and consideration, upon the narrative set out in the Order in Council that\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated May 2, 1930, from the Minister of Justice, stating that, in connection with negotiations with the Government of the Province of Saskatchewan looking toward the conclusion of an agreement for the transfer to the Province of its natural resources, the said Government has raised the question of the liability of Canada to render to the Province an account of its dealings, prior to September 1, 1905, with lands lying within the provincial boundaries as now denned, and it is desirable, in order to permit of the execution of such an agreement, that this question should be determined by the reference to the Supreme Court of Canada of questions expressed in a form which the Government of the Province considers appropriate to obtain the judgment of the Court on the contention it has put forward.\nThe Minister further states that a submission in the form hereto attached has accordingly been prepared on behalf of the Government of the Province, such submission containing certain questions and certain admissions of fact to which it is desirable to agree.\nThe Minister, therefore, recommends that the said submission be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada pursuant to Section 55 of the Supreme Court Act for hearing and consideration, and in order to obtain answers to the questions in the said submission set forth.\nFor the purpose of the submission, the following facts are admitted:\n(a) The area now lying within the boundaries of the Province of Saskatchewan formed a part of Rupert\u2019s Land and the North-Western Territory which were admitted into and became a part of the Dominion of Canada under Order in Council of June 23rd, 1870. (b) From the coming into force of the said Order in Council until September 1st, 1905, portions of the said area were from time to time alienated by the Dominion of Canada.\n(c) Throughout the following questions the term \u201clands\u201d means and includes \u201clands, mines, minerals and royalties incident thereto.\u201d\nFollowing and subject to the admissions, the questions are stated as follows:\u2014\n1. Upon Rupert\u2019s Land and the North-Western Territory being admitted into and becoming a part of the Dominion of Canada under Order in Council of June 23rd, 1870, were all lands then vested in the Crown and now lying within the boundaries of the Province of Saskatchewan vested in the Crown:\u2014\n(a) in the right of the Dominion of Canada, or\n(b) in the right of any province or provinces to be established within such area, or\n(c) to be administered for any province or provinces to be established within such area, or\n(d) to be administered for the benefit of the inhabitants from time to time of such area?\n2. Is the Dominion of Canada under obligation to account to the Province of Saskatchewan for any lands within its boundaries alienated by the Dominion of Canada prior to September 1st, 1905?\nIt was directed, by order of a Judge, in conformity with the practice, that the Attorneys General of all the provinces should be notified of the hearing, and should be at liberty to file factums of their respective arguments and to appear personally or by counsel.\nAt the hearing, counsel on behalf of the Attorney General of Saskatchewan submitted that question 1 (a) should be answered in the negative; that each of the alternatives of question 1 should be answered in the affirmative, and that question 2 should also be answered in the affirmative. The province of Alberta adopted and relied upon the argument submitted on behalf of Saskatchewan. But none of the other provinces appeared.\nAn Act of the Dominion, entitled An Act respecting the transfer of the Natural Resources of Saskatchewan, cap. 41 of 1930, was assented to on 30th May, 1930, approving an agreement set out in the schedule thereto, dated 20th March, 1930, between the Government of the Dominion and the Government of Saskatchewan; that agreement having previously been approved by the provincial legislature by cap. 87 of 1930, which received the Lieutenant Governor\u2019s assent on 10th April. Subsequently, by Imperial Act, c. 26 of 1930, assented to on 10th July, the agreement was confirmed and declared to have the force of law. The reasons which led the province to advocate the above answers are to be gathered from the argument as set out in the provincial factum and in the recitals of the agreement of 20th March, 1930, to which Saskatchewan is a party. I shall not attempt to expound the meaning of these recitals otherwise than by quoting the text as follows:\u2014\nWhereas by section twenty-one of the Saskatchewan Act, being chapter forty-two of the four and five Edward the Seventh, it was provided that \u201cAll Crown lands, mines and minerals and royalties incident thereto, and the interest of the Crown in the waters within the Province under the North-west Irrigation Act, 1898, shall continue to be vested in the Crown and administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of Canada, subject to the provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada with respect to road allowances and roads or trails in force immediately before the coming into force of this Act, which shall apply to the said Province with the substitution therein of the said Province for the North-west Territories;\u201d\nAnd whereas the Government of Canada desires that the Province should be placed in a position of equality with the other provinces of Confederation with respect to the administration and control of its natural resources as from its entry into Confederation in 1905;\nAnd whereas the Government of the Province contends that, before the Province was constituted and entered into Confederation as aforesaid, the Parliament of Canada was not competent to enact that the natural resources within the area now included within the boundaries of the Province should vest in the Crown and be administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of Canada and was not entitled to administer the said natural resources otherwise than for the benefit of the residents within the said area, and moreover that the Province is entitled to be and should be placed in a position of equality with the other Provinces of Confederation with respect to its natural resources as from the fifteenth day of July, 1870, when Rupert\u2019s Land and the North-Western Territory were admitted into and became part of the Dominion of Canada;\nAnd whereas it has been agreed between Canada and the said Province that the said section of the Saskatchewan Act should be modified and that provision should be made for the determination of the respective rights and obligations of Canada and the Province as herein set out.\nThe expression, \u201cnatural resources,\u201d is not defined, but it is evidently thought to include the public lands within the province; and the controversy is concerned only with the lands, situate within the provincial boundaries, which belonged to the Crown when Rupert\u2019s Land and the Northwestern Territory became part of the Dominion, and their proceeds or revenues.\nIn the case of a Reference as to the constitutional validity of sec. 17 of \u201cThe Alberta Act,\u201d[1], I had occasion to outline the legislative steps by which the prairie province of Alberta was constituted and acquired its provincial status under the Alberta Act, c. 3 of the Dominion; 1905; and it would be mere repetition, and therefore unnecessary, to reproduce that narrative here, as the facts relating to Saskatchewan are identical. But I shall take the opportunity to rectify a slip which, unfortunately, has found its way into the report of my judgment in the Alberta case, whereby the date of the Order in Council, admitting these territories into the Dominion from and after 15th July, 1870, is printed as 23rd July, 1870, instead of the true date, which is one month earlier.\nWhen the case was submitted, it appeared convenient to hear, at the opening, the argument on behalf of the province; and the Court, having taken the matter into consideration, find it unnecessary to hear the learned counsel who appeared for the Attorney-General of Canada.\nThe argument whereby it is sought to maintain the provincial answers is avowedly meant to support the pretensions set up by the factum of Saskatchewan, and I shall endeavour briefly to summarize it.\nFirst, it is said that, when Rupert\u2019s Land and the Northwestern Territories were admitted into the Union, they became, by express provision of sec. 146 of the British North America Act, 1867, \u201csubject to the provisions of this Act\u201d; and it is urged that, since, by sec. 109, the four original provinces retained their Crown Lands at the Union and had, by the fifth enumeration of sec. 92, exclusive legislative power for \u201cThe management and sale of the public lands belonging to the province and of the timber and wood thereon,\u201d these provisions, upon the introduction of the Territories into the Dominion, had unavoidably the effect to appropriate to the Territories, or to exclusively territorial purposes, the Crown Lands comprised therein; and, consequently, that the Parliament of Canada never had the authority to administer these lands, and certainly not to administer them for Dominion purposes, as subsequently provided by the Dominion Lands Act, cap. 23 of 1872, and the succeeding Acts regulating the administration of Dominion lands which, as amended and revised, remain in operation to the present time. Secondly, it is said that the provisions of the British North America Act, 1871, cap. 28 of the United Kingdom, were necessary in order to validate the Manitoba Act, cap. 3 of the Dominion, 1870, and equally so for enabling the Parliament of Canada to enact the Saskatchewan and Alberta Acts of 1905; that the authority of the Dominion to constitute the province of Saskatchewan thus depends upon the Act of 1871, and, to quote the submission, that \u201cThere is nothing in the Act authorizing the Dominion to hold the public domain for the purposes of Canada.\u201d It is recalled that there is a broad distinction between legislative jurisdiction and proprietary rights and that the conferring of the one affords no presumption of the transfer of the other; and it is suggested that the Crown, as represented by the Dominion, has no capacity to enjoy the beneficial interest in any of the public lands of the country, except, under sec. 117, for fortification or defence, and the property appropriated to Canada under the third schedule of the Act of 1867.\nThirdly, even if the Dominion, after the admission of the Territories into the Union, and after the enactment of the British North America Act, 1871, had power to legislate for the disposition of the Crown lands in the Territories, it is argued that, upon the passing of the Northwest Territories Acts, whereby the Parliament of Canada set up an elective assembly and provided for the government of the Territories, the Parliament, by so doing, became divested of any powers which it previously may have had for the administration of the territorial lands; and that by the operation of these Acts the public lands\u201d were vested in the Crown in the right of the inhabitants of the area, until the province was created in 1905.\u201d\nThese are the points relied upon by the province of Saskatchewan, and they are plainly in conflict with the terms of the Saskatchewan Act, c. 42 of 1905, as enacted. The statute proceeds upon two recitals, whereby the British North America Act, 1871, is invoked as the authority in the execution of which the Parliament of Canada may establish new provinces in the territories that form part of the Dominion, and make \u201cprovision for the constitution and administration of any such province, and for the passing of laws for the peace, order and good government of such province, and for its representation in the said Parliament of Canada\u201d; and it is declared expedient to establish, as a province, the territory thereinafter described, and to make provision for the government and representation thereof. The territory comprised within the specified boundaries is accordingly constituted as a province of the Dominion, under the name of Saskatchewan; and it is declared, by sec. 3, that\nThe provisions of The British North America Acts, 1867 to 1886, shall apply to the province of Saskatchewan in the same way and to the like extent as they apply to the provinces heretofore comprised in the Dominion, as if the said province of Saskatchewan had been one of the provinces originally united, except in so far as varied by this Act and except such provisions as are in terms made, or by reasonable intendment may be held to be, specially applicable to or only to affect one or more and not the whole of the said provinces.\nFollow provisions for the representation of the new province in the Senate and House of Commons; the constitution of the executive and the provincial legislature; the application of existing laws and official powers and functions; the continuance of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories until superseded by provincial legislation; special provisions with respect to societies, associations and joint stock companies incorporated by the authority of the legislature of the Northwest Territories; modifications of sec. 93 of the British North America Act, 1867, with respect to education; provincial subsidies; and, by secs. 20 and 21, it is provided as follows:\n20. Inasmuch as the said province will not have the public land as a source of revenue, there shall be paid by Canada to the province by half-yearly payments, in advance, an annual sum based upon the population of the province as from time to time ascertained by the quinquennial census thereof, as follows:\u2014\nThe population of the said province being assumed to be at present two hundred and fifty thousand, the sum payable until such population reaches four hundred thousand, shall be three hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars;\nThereafter, until such population reaches eight hundred thousand, the sum payable shall be five hundred and sixty-two thousand five hundred dollars;\nThereafter, until such population reaches one million two hundred thousand, the sum payable shall be seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars;\nAnd thereafter the sum payable shall be one million one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars.\n2. As an additional allowance in lieu of public lands, there shall be paid by Canada to the province annually by half-yearly payments, in advance, for five years from the time this Act comes into force, to provide for the construction of necessary public buildings, the sum of ninety-three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars.\n21. All Crown Lands, mines and minerals and royalties incident thereto, and the interest of the Crown in the waters within the province under The North-west Irrigation Act, 1898, shall continue to be vested in the Crown and administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of Canada, subject to the provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada with respect to road allowances and roads or trails in force immediately before the coming into force of this Act, which shall apply to the said province with the substitution therein of the said province for the Northwest Territories.\nThen there is a clause regulating the division of assets and liabilities as between Saskatchewan and Alberta; a provision that nothing in the Act shall prejudice or affect the rights or properties of the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, as contained in the conditions under which that company surrendered Rupert\u2019s Land to the Crown; and, by sec. 24, it is enacted that\nThe powers hereby granted to the said province shall be exercised subject to the provisions of section 16 of the contract set forth in the schedule to chapter 1 of the statutes of 1881, being an Act respecting the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\nThe legislative intent as to the destination of the lands seems thus to be plainly enough expressed; and compensation has been provided and presumably paid, in lieu of the lands, which it is declared, by the constituting authority, that the province is not to have. It is admitted, and at the foundation of the whole case, that Rupert\u2019s Land and the Northwestern Territory were, by the Queen\u2019s order of 23rd June, 1870, admitted into and became part of the Dominion on 15th July of that year; by the express terms of the Order in Council, the Parliament of Canada had, from that day, full power and authority to legislate for the future welfare and good government of the Northwestern Territory; and, by the provisions of the Rupert\u2019s Land Act, cap. 105 of the United Kingdom, 1868, and of the Order in Council, upon the admission of Rupert\u2019s Land, which includes by the definition, the whole of the lands and territories held or claimed to be held by the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, it thereupon became lawful for the Parliament of Canada\nfrom the date aforesaid, to make, ordain and establish within the land and territory so admitted as aforesaid, all such laws, institutions and ordinances, and to constitute such courts and officers as may be necessary for the peace, order and good government of Her Majesty\u2019s subjects and others therein. Moreover, by secs. 91 and 146 of the British North America Act, 1867, it had been enacted that it should\nbe lawful for the Queen, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces;\nand that it should be lawful for the Queen by and with the advice of her Privy Council,\non Addresses from the Houses of the Parliament of Canada, and from the Houses of the respective Legislatures of the Colonies or Provinces of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, and British Columbia, to admit those Colonies or Provinces, or any of them, into the Union, and on Address from the Houses of the Parliament of Canada, to admit Rupert\u2019s Land and the Northwestern Territory, or either of them, into the Union, on such Terms and Conditions in each Case as are in the Addresses expressed and as the Queen thinks fit to approve, subject to the Provisions of this Act; and the Provisions of any Order in Council in that behalf shall have effect as if they had been enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nAs to the nature and amplitude of the legislative powers conferred by the Imperial Parliament in the creation of subordinate governments of the Empire, it was explained in the Privy Council, by Lord Selborne, in The Queen v. Burah[2], that\nThe Indian legislature has powers expressly limited by the Act of the Imperial Parliament which created it, and it can, of course, do nothing beyond the limits which circumscribe these powers. But, when acting within those limits, it is not in any sense an agent or delegate of the Imperial Parliament, but has, and was intended to have, plenary powers of legislation, as large, and of the same nature, as those of Parliament itself. The established courts of justice, when a question arises whether the prescribed limits have been exceeded, must of necessity determine that question; and the only way in which they can properly do so, is by looking to the terms of the instrument by which, affirmatively, the legislative powers were created, and by which, negatively, they are restricted. If what has been done is legislation, within the general scope of the affirmative words which give the power, and if it violates no express condition or restriction by which that power is limited (in which category would, of course, be included any Act of the Imperial Parliament at variance with it), it is not for any court of justice to inquire further, or to enlarge constructively those conditions and restrictions.\nTo the like effect are the observations of Sir Barnes Peacock, in Hodge v. The Queen[3], with reference to the Canadian provinces. And these expressions were quoted with approval by Lord Watson in Liquidators of the Maritime Bank of Canada v. Receiver-General of New Brunswick[4].\nIn Riel v. Regina[5], the petitioner was tried and convicted of treason under the procedure enacted by the Northwest Territories Act, 1880, c. 25. S. 76 conferred upon the stipendiary magistrates in the Territories jurisdiction to hear and determine criminal offences, including treason, with the intervention of a jury of six. It was urged before the Board, upon application for special leave to appeal, that the Dominion Parliament had no power to deprive the petitioner of a right which he claimed to have under English law to trial before a judge with a jury of twelve; but Lord Halsbury, L.C., delivering the judgment, at pp. 678-9, said:\nIt appears to be suggested that any provision differing from the provisions which in this country have been made for administration, peace, order and good government cannot, as matters of law, be provisions for peace, order and good government in the territories to which the statute relates, and further that, if a court of law should come to the conclusion that a particular enactment was not calculated as matter of fact and policy to secure peace, order and good government, that they would be entitled to regard any statute directed to those objects, but which a court should think likely to fail of that effect, as ultra vires and beyond the competency of the Dominion Parliament to enact.\nTheir Lordships are of opinion that there is not the least colour for such a contention. The words of the statute are apt to authorize the utmost discretion of enactment for the attainment of the objects pointed to. They are words under which the widest departure from criminal procedure as it is known and practised in this country have been authorized in Her Majesty\u2019s Indian Empire. Forms of procedure unknown to the English common law have there been established and acted upon, and to throw the least doubt upon the validity of powers conveyed by those words would be of widely mischievous consequence.\nGiving due effect to the Dominion powers of legislation, as expounded by or resulting from these authorities, it is very difficult to discover any maintainable ground in the pretension that the province of Saskatchewan, whether on behalf of itself or for the inhabitants of those parts of the Northwest Territories which are embraced in the province, has constitutional rights which the Queen did not, either in Council or in Parliament, bestow upon the territories or upon the province, and which the Parliament of Canada, by the Saskatchewan Act, which operates irrevocably under the British North America Act, 1871, declared that the province should not possess. It will be observed that, while, by sec. 146 of the British North America Act, 1867, Rupert\u2019s Land and the Northwestern Territories, or either of them, may be admitted into the Union on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the Addresses \u201cexpressed\u201d and as the Queen thinks fit to approve, \u201csubject to the provisions of this Act,\u201d it is declared, by sec. 4 of the British North America Act, 1871, without any qualification, that the Parliament of Canada may, from time to time, make provision for the administration, peace, order and good government of any territory not for the time being included in any province; and, whether you consider one or the other, or both of these provisions, as applicable, there are no terms or conditions, expressed in the Addresses, or sanctioned by the terms of Union, with which the legislation of the Dominion conflicts, or is alleged to conflict.\nAs to the effect of sec. 3 of the Saskatchewan Act, the corresponding provision of the Alberta Act was considered by the Privy Council in Attorney-General for Alberta v. Attorney-General for Canada[6], where Lord Buckmaster, after reviewing the legislation, which differs in no material respect from that affecting Saskatchewan, including the fundamental provisions of sec. 3 of the Alberta Act, said that, reading the whole Act together, their Lordships\nregard the effect of this section as placing the Province of Alberta in the same position as the other Provinces in regard to property, except as varied by the statute, either by express terms or reasonable implication. Sec. 21 is only sensible on this hypothesis, for unless it was assumed that it was required for the purpose of preserving the Crown rights in the property to which it relates, it would be meaningless, but if that be once assumed it follows that the property to which it does not relate is vested in the Crown, not for the purposes of Canada, but for the purposes of the Province of Alberta.\nOther passages in Lord Buckmaster\u2019s judgment are equally destructive of the argument which seeks to maintain the contention that there is some occult principle of law, not depending upon and indeed proof against legislation, whereby a province or territory of Canada or its inhabitants must have and enjoy, for its or their exclusive benefit, the waste lands of the Crown which lie within its borders. His Lordship said, referring to s. 109 of the British North America Act, 1867, a provision upon which the province puts much stress, The territory out of which the Province of Alberta is constituted was unaffected by this section, but on the admission of the North West Territories into the Dominion of Canada in 1870 and the passing of the British North America Act, 1871, became subject to the laws of the Parliament of Canada. It therefore followed that the Province could never, apart from statute, be in the position of owning lands, mines, minerals and royalties.\nAnd it follows also that the legislation of the Dominion was paramount and unaffected by any powers granted to the legislature or the local government of the Territories, or any territorial exercise of those powers which might prove to be repugnant.\nNo doubt there is, as counsel for the province suggests, a distinction recognized between legislative powers and proprietary rights, and the Crown may, for one purpose, be represented by the Dominion, and, for the other purpose, by a province, as in the case of the Inland Fisheries or Indian Lands; but it is in perfect conformity with the Canadian system that Dominion rights of property should be subject to the legislative control of the Parliament; and it is expressly so with regard to what is described generally in the first enumeration of sec. 91 of the Act of 1867, as \u201cthe public debt and property.\u201d\nIt is objected that, although the Territories were made part of the Dominion and became subject to its legislative control, there was no grant or conveyance of the lands by the Imperial Crown to the Dominion; but that was not requisite, nor was it the proper method of effecting the transaction. It is not by grant inter partes that Crown lands are passed from one branch to another of the King\u2019s government; the transfer takes effect, in the absence of special provision, sometimes by Order in Council, sometimes by despatch. There is only one Crown, and the lands belonging to the Crown are and remain vested in it, notwithstanding that the administration of them and the exercise of their beneficial use may, from time to time, as competently authorized, be regulated upon the advice of different Ministers charged with the appropriate service. I will quote the words of Lord Davey in Ontario Mining Company v. Seybold[7], where his Lordship, referring to Lord Watson\u2019s judgment in the St. Catherines Milling Case[8], said In delivering the judgment of the Board, Lord Watson observed that in construing the enactments of the British North America Act, 1867, \u201cit must always be kept in view that wherever public land with its incidents is described as \u2018the property of or as \u2018belonging to\u2019 the Dominion or a province, these expressions merely import that the right to its beneficial use or its proceeds has been appropriated to the Dominion or the province, as the case may be, and is subject to the control of its legislature, the land itself being vested in the Grown.\u201d Their Lordships think that it should be added that the right of disposing of the land can only be exercised by the Crown under the advice of the Ministers of the Dominion or province, as the case may be, to which the beneficial use of the land or its proceeds has been appropriated, and by an instrument under the seal of the Dominion or the province.\nThe province has, in my opinion, failed to advance any substantial reason by which to justify the answers which it suggests.\nI would, on the contrary, answer to question one, (a) \u201cYes\u201d; (b) \u201cNo\u201d; (c) \u201cNo.\u201d; (d) \u201cNot otherwise than as sharing in any benefit which might accrue to them under the dispositions of Parliament.\u201d I would answer question two in the negative.\nQuestions answered accordingly.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General of Canada: W.

Crim. Cas. 51) affirming (by majority) his conviction for murder. It had been contended in his defence that at the time of his act his condition from drink was such that the act could not be murder; and he alleged misdirection by the trial judge to the jury on this question, which involved the law as to what state of incapacity resulting from drink will reduce a crime from murder to manslaughter.\nHeld: In the circumstances of the case, an essential question for the jury was: Given the existence of some degree of capacity in the accused, and assuming the facts deposed to by Crown witnesses (if credited) in describing the accused\u2019s act in striking the fatal blow and his conduct and expressions before and after that act, whether or not he was so affected by drink as to be incapable of having the intent to kill or of having the intent (in reckless disregard of the consequences) to cause some bodily injury, \u201cknown\u201d to him to be \u201clikely to cause death\u201d (Cr. Code, s. 259 (a) (b)). That question was one upon which the jury must pass in order to enable them to determine the existence or non-existence of the intent in fact. (Beard\u2019s case, [1920] A.C. 479, at 501-502, referred to). And as the trial judge, while properly directing the jury\u2019s attention to the defence as put forward by accused\u2019s counsel (that accused was in such a state that his mind was not functioning, that his \u201cmind was gone,\u201d that he was incapable of a degree of \u201cthought\u201d enabling him to be aware of the nature of his physical acts), did not direct them to the question above defined, there should be a new trial.\nAPPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1], sitting as a Court of Appeal under the provisions of the Criminal Code, which affirmed (Mellish and Carroll JJ. dissenting) his conviction, at trial before Chisholm J. and a jury, on an indictment for murder. A defence of the accused was that his condition of drunkenness, at the time of the commission of the offence, was such that he should not be convicted of the crime. of murder; and his main ground of appeal to this Court was that there was misdirection by the trial judge in his instructions to the jury in this regard; the question involving the law as to what state of incapacity resulting from drink will reduce a crime from murder to manslaughter.\nD. A. Cameron K.C. for the appellant.\nF. F. Mathers K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014We have come to the conclusion that there must be a new trial, and the discussion of the facts will, therefore, be limited to what is strictly unavoidable in the elucidation of the points of law involved. Culpable homicide (by stabbing) was not, at any stage of the proceedings, disputed. The defence rested upon the alleged condition of the appellant resulting from drink, and the real issue was whether or not his condition, at the time of the commission of the offence, was such as to bring the offence within the legal category of manslaughter. The defence appears from the learned judge\u2019s charge to have been thus presented to the jury. The accused, counsel seems to have urged, was in such a state that his mind was not functioning, that his \u201cmind was gone,\u201d that he was incapable of a degree of \u201cthought\u201d enabling him to be aware of the nature of his physical acts. The learned trial judge told the jury that, this view of the prisoner\u2019s condition could not be accepted unless they were satisfied that the witnesses for the Crown, who had described the prisoner\u2019s act in striking the fatal blow, and had given an account of his conduct and reported the expressions used by him before and after that act, were not worthy of credit.\nThis, we have no doubt, was a proper direction: but the appeal turns upon other considerations. The rules of law for determining the validity of a defence such as that put forward by the accused, are stated in two propositions in the judgment of Lord Birkenhead in Beard\u2019s case (1). These propositions, with which the other six Lords agreed, are as follows:\n2. That evidence of drunkenness which renders the accused incapable of forming the specific intent essential to constitute the crime should be taken into consideration with the other facts proved in order to determine whether or not he had this intent.\n3. That evidence of drunkenness falling short of a proved incapacity in the accused to form the intent necessary to constitute the crime, and merely establishing that his mind was affected by drink so that he more readily gave way to some violent passion, does not rebut the presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of his acts.\nThese propositions embody the rules governing us on this appeal; but, before considering the application of them to the facts, it is desirable to advert to the provisions of the Criminal Code upon the subjects of murder and manslaughter. The Code (sections 250 and 252), begins by defining homicide. Homicide, it is declared, falls into two classes, culpable and not culpable, of which the last mentioned, CD Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard, [1920] A.C. 479, at 501-502. homicide which is not culpable, is not an offence. Culpable homicide (which includes murder and manslaughter) is then defined; and is declared to be murder in the cases enumerated in sections 259 and 260. Section 261 formulates the conditions in which murder may, by \u201cprovocation,\u201d be reduced to manslaughter, and finally by section 262, it is declared that culpable homicide not amounting to murder is manslaughter. Cases of culpable homicide as defined by sections 259 and 260 constitute murder unless the provisions of section 261, dealing with the effect of provocation, come into play, or the person charged is, on some special ground, protected from criminal responsibility; other cases of culpable homicide, unless the offender is within some such protection, constitute manslaughter.\nWe are not concerned with section 260 or with the 3rd or 4th subsection of section 259. The definitions now pertinent are those found in subsections (a) and (b) of section 259, which are in these words:\n259. Culpable homicide is murder,\n(a) if the offender means to cause the death of the person killed;\n(b) if the offender means to cause to the person killed any bodily injury which is known to the offender to be likely to cause death, and is reckless whether death ensues or not;\nSubsection (b) comes into operation where the offender means to cause bodily harm which he knows to be likely to cause death, and when he is in the state of mind described by the words \u201creckless whether death ensues or not.\u201d In the circumstances of this case, the question of substance for the jury was whether the appellant was capable of having the intent to kill or of having the intent (in reckless disregard of the consequences) to cause some bodily injury, \u201cknown\u201d to him to be \u201clikely to cause death.\u201d\nSection 259 seems to narrow somewhat the common law definition of murder. In the judgment quoted above[2] (at pages 503 and 504), Lord Birkenhead, referring to the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Meade\u2019s case[3], uses these words:\nYour Lordships have had the advantage of a much more elaborate examination of the authorities upon which the rule is founded than was placed before the Court of Criminal Appeal, and I apprehend can have no doubt that the proposition in Meade\u2019s case (1) in its wider interpretation is not, and cannot be, supported by authority. The difficulty has arisen largely because the Court of Criminal Appeal used language which has been construed as suggesting that the test of the condition of mind of the prisoner is not whether he was incapable of forming the intent but whether he was incapable of foreseeing or measurin the consequences of the act. In this respect the so-called rule differs from the direction of Lord Coleridge J., which is more strictly in accordance with the earlier authorities.\nThe intent necessary to bring a given offence under the definition in subsection (b) involves a knowledge by the offender of the \u201clikely\u201d consequences of his act; and a direction to the jury that, in examining a defence based upon incapacity alleged to have been produced by drunkenness, they should not consider the capacity of the accused to \u201cforesee or measure the consequences of his act\u201d would hardly be a direction in conformity with the criteria formulated in section 259. The right direction in cases involving the application of subsection (b) is that evidence of drunkenness rendering the accused incapable of the state of mind defined by that subsection may be taken into account with the other facts of the case for the purpose of determining whether or not, in fact, the accused had the intent necessary to bring the case within that subsection; but that the existence of drunkenness not involving such incapacity is not a defence.\nThe learned trial judge instructed the jury that to justify a conviction for murder they must find that the accused was animated by the intent to kill. This was, technically, a little too favourable to the prisoner; although it is probable that such a departure from strict technical precision would seldom have any effect on the result of a trial. In this case, the learned judge no doubt considered that the jury was not likely to dwell upon the distinction between meaning to kill, and meaning to inflict injury known to be likely to cause death, and in reckless disregard of the consequences.\nThe issue as to capacity is an issue of fact and is primarily for the jury. There may be cases in which, the defence of want of capacity resulting from drunkenness having been put forward, the trial judge would be justified in directing the jury that there was no evidence of that degree of incapacity which alone could properly be considered by them in passing upon the existence of intent in fact. This, however, we think, is not one of those cases. The jury evidently negatived the \u201cabsolute incapacity,\u201d the existence of which the learned judge asked them to consider, and which he exemplified by the illustration of a drunken mother destroying the life of her infant child by rolling over upon it in bed; but there still remained the question\u2014given the existence of some degree of capacity, and assuming the facts deposed to by the witnesses for the Crown, whether the appellant was so affected by drink as to be incapable of having the intent to kill or of meaning to cause an injury which he knew was likely to result in death. This issue, as already observed, was primarily for the jury; and it was an issue upon which they must pass in order to enable them to determine the existence or non-existence of the intent in fact.\nThe able and experienced judge who presided at the trial properly directed the attention of the jury to the defence as it was put before them by counsel for the prisoner; and, having done this, he did not ask them to apply their minds to the further issue we have just defined. It was the prisoner\u2019s right, however, notwithstanding the course of his counsel at the trial, to have the jury instructed upon this feature of the case. We think, therefore, that there must be a new trial.\nAppeal allowed, and new trial ordered.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D. A. Cameron.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F. F.

S. 23 (1) provided that for a certain period \u201cthe company and its property in New Brunswick pertaining to the development of power on the Saint John River shall be exempt from all municipal and other taxation and assessment\u201d (other than a fixed school tax not in question). The question before this Court was whether or not the company was liable to be assessed in the town of Grand Falls, N.B., (where its head office was) upon or with respect to income derived by it from or by virtue of the sale of power generated at its plant in Grand Falls from the use of the waters of said river.\nHeld: The company was not liable to be so assessed. The exemption extended, not only to property, but also to the company itself, and included income. The mention of its \u201cproperty\u201d in said s. 23 (1) did not create an inference of intention that property only should be exempt. The plain language of the exempting provision left no room for operation of any rule for strict construction against the company invoked on grounds that its incorporating Act was in the nature of a private Act and that it was claiming exemption from taxation. The Interpretation Act, R.S.N.B., 1927, c. 1, s. 6; Foley v. Fletcher, 3. H. & N. 769, at 780-781; City of Halifax v. Nova Scotia Car Works, Ltd., [1914] A.C. 992, cited. Further, the omission of mention of the company itself in s. 23 (2) exempting \u201cthe company\u2019s property\u201d pertaining to transmission of power, was significant.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division.\nThe present respondent, the Saint John River Power Company, applied for an order for a writ of certiorari for the removal into the Supreme Court of New Brunswick of a certain assessment made by the present appellants, as assessors for the Town of Grand Falls in the Province of New Brunswick, in and for the year 1929, with a view to the same being quashed in so far as it related to income and to the real estate of the applicant pertaining to the development of power on the Saint John River. The order was granted and the writ made returnable before the Appeal Division of the Court, and the present appellants were ordered to show cause why the said assessment should not be quashed in so far as it related to the income and real estate aforesaid. The case was stood over, and the parties subsequently agreed upon a stated case, all question of assessment upon real estate being settled and withdrawn. The stated case was as follows:\nstated case\n\u201c1. The Town of Grand Falls was incorporated by Act of the Legislature of the Province of New Brunswick, 53 Victoria, Chapter 73. Section 62 of that Act confers upon the Assessors of the Town the following powers:\n62. The Assessors shall without delay after receiving the warrants of the assessment, meet and enter into a book to be provided at the public expense, the names of all persons to be rated in the said Town, and shall distinguish therein in separate columns the real estate, personal estate and income of each person, and shall without delay, after the expiration of thirty days\u2019 notice of their appointment proceed to raise all rates, taxes or assessments levied or imposed upon the said Town, in the manner following, that is to say:\u2014\n1st. One-sixth of the whole amount of such tax, rate or assessment, shall be assessed and levied by an equal tax on the poll of every male inhabitant of the said Town of Grand Falls above the age of twenty-one years.\n2nd. The remaining five-sixths of the whole amount of such rate or assessment shall be assessed and levied in due proportion upon all real estate in the said Town of Grand Falls and upon the personal estate of the inhabitants thereof, including that of any Joint Stock Company or Corporation which has its principal place of business within the Province and is situated or located in the said Town, after deducting from such personal estate the indebtedness of each inhabitant respectively, and also upon the annual income or emoluments of such inhabitants, companies or corporations derived from any office, profession, trade, business, work, labour, occupation or employment whatsoever within the Province, and not from invested real or personal estate of such inhabitants, and also upon the capital stock, income or other things of Corporations and Joint Stock Companies; * * *\n2. The said the Saint John River Power Company was incorporated by 16 George V (1926), Chapter 45, and by Section 23 thereof was granted certain exemptions from taxation. Said section is as follows:\u2014\n23. (1) For a period of forty years from the date of the first generation of power by the Company, the Company and its property in New Brunswick pertaining to the development of power on the Saint John River shall be exempt from all municipal and other taxation and assessment, other than a tax of five thousand dollars a year which shall be payable to the school district or districts in which the main power works of the Company at or near Grand Falls are situated and in case of more than one such district such amount shall, in case of disagreement as to the apportionment, be apportioned by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\n(2) The Company\u2019s property in New Brunswick pertaining to the transmission of power shall be exempt from all municipal and other taxation and assessment.\n\u201c3. The Company commenced the generation of power on or about the fifteenth day of October, 1928.\n\u201c4. The head office of the Company was in the Town of Grand Falls aforesaid during the year 1929, and the [present appellants] were the Assessors in and for the said Town for the said year.\n\u201c5. That in the said year 1929 the said Assessors assessed the said Saint John River Power Company upon and in respect to real estate of the value of $75,000 and with respect to income in the sum of $100,000.\n\u201c6. That on the application of the said Company a Writ of Certiorari was granted to remove into this Court the said Assessment with a view of having the same quashed and a rule nisi to quash the same.\n\u201c7. That the parties hereto agreed that all questions arising out of and with respect to rates, taxes and assessments, made by the said Assessors upon and with respect to real estate of the said Company have been settled and are hereby withdrawn from the consideration of this Honourable Court in this case.\n\u201c8. That this Honourable Court is asked to adjudicate upon the question of liability of the said Saint John River Power Company to be assessed by the Assessors of the Town of Grand Falls upon income.\n\u201c9. The Company during the year 1929 and previous thereto had no income except as follows:\u2014\n(a) Income derived from the sale of electricity developed in the Power Plant of the Company erected at Grand Falls to generate electricity from the use of the waters of the Saint John River.\n(b) Income derived from the sale of electricity purchased from the Van Buren Light & Power Company of Van Buren, in the State of Maine, and distributed over the system formerly owned by the St. Leonard Electric Company, Limited, a company incorporated by Act 1, George V, 1911, Chapter 129, but now owned by the Saint John River Power Company. * * * The Company claims that the result of said operations for the said year 1929 was a loss. The said Assessors claim it was a profit, that the Company is not entitled to charge up interest on the investment and depreciation in arriving at the taxable amount.\n\u201c10. The questions for determination by the Court are:\n\u201c(1) Is the Company liable to be assessed in the Town of Grand Falls upon or with respect to income derived by it from or by virtue of the sale of power generated at its plant in Grand Falls?\n\u201c(2) Is the Company liable to be assessed in the Town of Grand Falls upon or with respect to income derived by it from or by virtue of the sale of power distributed in the manner mentioned in paragraph (9 b) of this Stated Case?\n\u201c11. Either party is at liberty to refer to any other statute or statutes that they may deem material.\n\u201c12. The parties have made an agreement as to costs and the Court is not asked to deal with them.\u201d\nThe Supreme Court of New Brunswick answered \u201cno\u201d to question No. 1 submitted in the stated case, and \u201cyes\u201d to question No. 2, and ordered that so much of the assessment as was made upon the income derived from the sale of electricity in the company\u2019s plant at Grand Falls be quashed.\nThe assessors, pursuant to special leave granted by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada against the holding that the company was not liable to be assessed in Grand Falls upon or with respect to income derived by it from or by virtue of the sale of power generated at its plant in Grand Falls.\nJ. F. H. Teed for the appellants.\nP. J. Hughes K.C. and H. A. Carr for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014Upon application of the respondent, and by order of the Chief Justice of New Brunswick, a writ of certiorari was issued out of the Supreme Court of the province, to bring up an assessment made by the appellants as assessors for the Town of Grand Falls for the year 1929, with the purpose of having the assessment quashed in so far as it related to income and to real estate of the respondent appertaining to the development of power on the St. John River. The assessors made their return; some differences were determined by agreement, and a case was stated by the parties, submitting, upon agreed facts, two questions for the determination of the court. The questions are as follows:\n(1) Is the Company liable to be assessed in the Town of Grand Falls upon or with respect to income derived by it from or by virtue of the sale of power generated at its plant in Grand Falls?\n(2) Is the Company liable to be assessed in the Town of Grand Falls upon or with respect to income derived by it from or by virtue of the sale of power distributed in the manner mentioned in paragraph 9 (b) of this Stated Case?\nThe case came before the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court, where, unanimously, the first question was answered in the negative and the second in the affirmative. The appellants thus failed in their contention upon the first question, but succeeded as to the second, and they are now appealing from the first answer.\nThe St. John River Power Company, respondent, was incorporated by Act of the local legislature, c. 45 of 1926, with head office at the town of Grand Falls, in the province of New Brunswick, and it was provided, by section 5, that\nThe Company may generate, purchase or otherwise acquire, sell, transmit and distribute electrical power and energy, and specifically, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall have full right and authority to develop hydro-electric power on the Saint John River at or near Grand Falls, etc.\nProvisions follow conferring upon the company extensive powers, concessions and privileges in aid of the general project sanctioned by the Act.\nBy section 23,\n(1) For a period of forty years from the date of the first generation of power by the Company, the Company and its property in New Brunswick pertaining to the development of power on the Saint John River shall be exempt from all municipal and other taxation and assessment, other than a tax of five thousand dollars a year which shall be payable to the school district or districts in which the main power works of the Company at or near Grand Falls are situated and in case of more than one such district such amount shall, in case of disagreement as to the apportionment, be apportioned by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. (2) The Company\u2019s property in New Brunswick pertaining to the transmission of power shall be exempt from all municipal and other taxation and assessment.\nThe Town of Grand Falls was incorporated by c. 73 of 1890, and the material taxing provisions of the town are to be found in section 62, and are set out in the stated case. The assessors are to enter the names of all persons to be rated, distinguishing in separate columns the real estate, personal estate and income of each person, and shall proceed, after the statutory delay, to raise all rates, taxes or assessments levied or imposed; one-sixth by a poll tax, and the remaining five-sixths\nin due proportion upon all real estate in the said Town of Grand Falls and upon the personal estate of the inhabitants thereof, including that of any Joint Stock Company or Corporation which has its principal place of business within the Province and is situated or located in the said Town, after deducting from such personal estate the indebtedness of each inhabitant respectively, and also upon the annual income or emoluments of such inhabitants, companies or corporations, etc.\nNo doubt the annual income of any incorporated joint stock company or corporation, within the description of this clause, is to be assessed and the tax is to be levied thereon in proportion. It is not disputed that the words of subsection 1 of section 23, the exempting section of the company\u2019s Act of incorporation, would operate to exempt the company from this income tax, if, in declaring the exemption, the legislature had not coupled with the company its property. The words are: \u201cThe company and its property in New Brunswick pertaining to the development of power on the Saint John River shall be exempt from all municipal and other taxation and assessment,\u201d subject to an exception which is not at present material. But from the mention of property, it is said, arises the inference that it is intended that property only shall be exempt. I am unable to follow this argument, for I can imagine that a company negotiating to establish and operate works within the town might reasonably stipulate, for tax exemption, both for itself and its property; and, if that be allowed, there is certainly no general principle of interpretation by which the expression is not to have effect in any particular, once it is found, as I think it must be, that the exemption, as enacted, in terms extends, not only to the property of the company, but also to the company itself. No question is suggested as to whether the company\u2019s exemption is qualified by the words, \u201cpertaining to the development of power on the Saint John River,\u201d which naturally, and primarily at least, have their application to the property of the company, because it appears by the case that the income in controversy is derived \u201cfrom the sale of electricity developed in the power plant of the company erected at Grand Falls, to generate electricity from the use of the waters of the St. John River\u201d; and, by reference to the frame of the question, it will be perceived that the answer subject to appeal is confined to \u201cincome derived by it (the company) from or by virtue of the sale of power generated at its plant in Grand Falls.\u201d\nThe appellant argues that the Act incorporating the respondent company is in the nature of a private Act, and that, therefore, and also because the respondent is claiming an exemption from taxation, the Act should be strictly construed against it, and authorities are cited; but there is nothing in any of these which was ever intended to modify or reduce the effect of a clear statutory provision. Moreever, it is declared by the R.S., N.B., 1927, c. 1, (The Interpretation Act), section 6, that\nEvery Act shall be deemed to be a public Act and shall be judicially noticed by all Judges, Justices of the Peace and others without being specially pleaded.\nI think that, for a case like this, the authorities make it abundantly clear that the company is not to suffer any disadvantage by reason of the fact that it relies upon an exemption sanctioned by its incorporating Act, or for the reason that the effect of the statutory provision is to confer upon the company an exemption which, apart from that provision, it would not have possessed.\nIn Foley v. Fletcher[1], Baron Bramwell was considering the question of income tax, and he said:\nI am desirous to say that I disclaim in this case acting on the maxim, that a burden shall not be imposed on the public unless by clear and unambiguous language. In Re Micklethwait[2], Parke B., says: \u201cIt is a well established rule that the subject is not to be taxed without clear words for that purpose; and also that every act of parliament is to be read according to the natural construction of its words.\u201d The latter is the main rule, the other subordinate. Construe the statute correctly, if its meaning can be ascertained. Maxims of the sort referred to, as frequently applied, are mere invitations to erroneous construction, though when properly understood they are quite correct. The natural course of things is, that the heir takes on the death of the person last seised; whoever seeks to disturb that rule must make out his right to do so. So, whoever seeks to impose a tax or penalty must establish the right; whoever seeks to punish must establish the guilt. The rule properly understood is, that the burden of proof is on the assertor, not that, wherever there is any doubt, a statute is to be said not to mean what it does mean.\nMoreover, in the City of Halifax v. Nova Scotia Car Works, Limited[3], where, under an agreement with the city specially sanctioned by the legislature, the company was entitled to \u201ca total exemption from taxation,\u201d for ten years upon its lands and buildings situated in the city, and a question arose as to whether this exemption extended to a provision whereby the owners of property fronting upon any sewer laid by the city should be contributors to the cost of its construction, according to their frontage, it was said by Lord Sumner, who pronounced the judgment of the Judicial Committee, that\nSo far as a simple question of interpretation is affected by presumptions at all, their Lordships are of opinion that this clause should be construed favourably to the respondents. They have performed the whole consideration on their side by establishing their works, and the consideration moving to them has been earned and ought not to be thereafter restricted. The matter is one of bargain and of mutual advantage; it is not a case of one citizen seeking to escape from his share of common burthens and so increasing pro tanto the burthen on the others.\nIn my view the court would not be justified to deny its proper effect to the provision of the statute whereby the company is, in plain language, declared to be exempt; and the value of this exemption, as distinguished from the exemption of property, so far as we have been shewn, appears to relate principally, if not entirely, to income.\nIt is also significant that by subsection (2) of the exempting section, by which \u201cthe company\u2019s property in New Brunswick pertaining to the transmission of power shall be exempt from all municipal and other taxation and assessment,\u201d the company itself is not mentioned, an omission which seems remarkable, if the intention were that the exemptions afforded by the two subsections should equally embrace both the company and its property, or should equally be confined to the company\u2019s property.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Teed & Teed.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H.

Hill, [1891] 1 Q.B. 605, at 614, cited). In each case the questions whether the master fairly and honestly on reasonable ground believed it necessary to take shelter, and whether he exercised reasonable skill, competence and courage in the circumstances, are questions of fact for the tribunal whose duty it is to find the facts.\nIn the present case, on the evidence, the finding at trial that defendant ship was within such waters when seized, and was not justified on the ground of \u201cstress of weather\u201d in entering them, was affirmed.\nA contention that necessity to repair the engine was an \u201cunavoidable cause\u201d (Customs Act, s. 183, supra) justifying such entry, was rejected, as, on the evidence, the repair in question was not an immediate necessity, the defect not affecting the sailing of the vessel or making it more dangerous; moreover, failure to have the vessel in seasonable repair on going to sea could not be deemed an \u201cunavoidable cause.\u201d\nThe Convention of October 20, 1818, between Great Britain and the United States (respecting fisheries and boundary lines) did not apply to the Pacific waters so far as fisheries were concerned, and therefore could not be available as justification for the entry in question.\nAPPEAL by the defendant ship from the judgment of Martin J., Local Judge in Admiralty, in the Exchequer Court of Canada, British Columbia Admiralty District, whereby he pronounced that the ship, a foreign fishing vessel within the meaning of the Customs and Fisheries Protection Act, R.S.C., 1927, c 43, at the time of her seizure in British waters, had entered British waters within three marine miles of the coast of Canada for a purpose not permitted by treaty or convention, or by any law of Great Britain or of Canada for the time being in force, in violation of the Customs and Fisheries Protection Act aforesaid; and condemned the said vessel and the tackle, rigging, apparel, furniture, stores and cargo thereof as forfeited to His Majesty.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nWm. Savage for the appellant.\nD. L. McCarthy K.C. and J. E. Read K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Mr. Justice Martin pronounced in the Exchequer Court of Canada, British Columbia Admiralty Division, in which he condemned as forfeited to His Majesty a fishing vessel named May registered at Ketchikan, U.S.A., and all her equipment, cargo and stores. The vessel was condemned on the ground that she was a foreign fishing vessel within the meaning of the Customs and Fisheries Protection Act, cap. 43, R.S.C., 1927, and that, at the time of her seizure, she was within three marine miles of the coast of Canada, having entered British waters for a purpose not permitted by treaty or convention or by any law of Great Britain or Canada, in violation of the said Act.\nThe May was a ten ton salmon trawler owned by B. O. Knudsen, and operated by Knudsen and one fisherman, Henry Christophersen. She was propelled by a 30 horsepower oil burning engine. She left Ketchikan at 9 a.m., June 3, 1930, and had on board 6 tons of ice, 700 gallons of oil and 100 gallons of water. Knudsen says he set out to go to the Cape Calvert fishing grounds, off Goose Island, some 200 or 250 miles south. His course lay straight across Dixon Entrance and down Hecate Straits. He says that about 3 or 4 p.m., a southeast wind sprang up and the sea became choppy; at 5 p.m., as the wind was increasing and dead ahead, he concluded it was too rough to venture down Hecate Straits, so he turned to go back to Cape Chacon, in American territory. After running a short distance before the wind, he says, a wave broke over his stern, so he directed his course southwesterly to find shelter behind Rose Spit Point of Graham Island. He sighted Rose Spit buoy between 6 and 7 p.m. and was then about two miles northwest of it. He says he headed south for the anchorage in McIntyre Bay, sailing by compass as it was misty, until about 9.30 when Christophersen took the soundings and found 40 fathoms of water. From the depth of the water he concluded he was outside the three mile limit. He then anchored and, after he had put some packing in the pump which is used to supply the engine with oil, he went to bed.\nAt 2.30 on the morning of June 4 the Canadian Government Patrol launch Rividis, commanded by Captain Sheppard, a commissioned officer in the Fishery Protection Service, ran alongside the May and Captain Sheppard boarded her. Both Knudsen and Christophersen were then asleep. He woke them up and Knudsen asked him if he thought he was within the three mile limit, to which Sheppard replied that he thought he was, but that he would wait until it was clear daylight so that he could verify the May\u2019s position. He then took possession of her papers and manifest and requested Knudsen to come on board the Rividis where he questioned him, entering the questions and answers in the log. The material questions and answers are as follows:\u2014\nQ. 1. What time did you anchor here?\u2014A. 9.30 p.m. Date June 3rd.\nQ. 2. What were the weather conditions when you anchored?\u2014A. Pretty good when I anchored here.\nQ. 3. What were the weather conditions for the past 48 hours?\u2014A. Fine when I left Ketchikan and until 4 p.m. 3rd when it started to blow hard, well\u2014not blow hard, but a choppy sea.\nQ. 4. What was your reason for anchoring?\u2014A. Bad weather off Rose Spit Buoy. It was very uncomfortable there.\n* * * * *\nQ. 9. How long have you been fishing in the locality?\u2014A. About 3 weeks this season.\nQ. 10. Do you think it was calm and smooth 8 to 10 miles off McIntyre Bay when you anchored off Rose Spit?\u2014A. Possibly it was.\nQ. 11. You did not trouble to go off shore and make certain?\u2014A. No 1 steered for the anchorage first.\nAt daylight between the hours of 3 and 3.30 a.m., June 4, Captain Sheppard took both compass bearings and sextant angles in order to fix the location of the May, and found her to be 2.5 miles from shore, half a mile within Canadian territorial waters. The entry in the log as to the location of the vessel is as follows:\u2014\nThe following sextant angles were taken and verified by Lieut. Comdr. Godfrey.\nTow Hill and Argonaut Hill 25\u00b0 15\u2019.\nArgonaut Hill and end of trees 64\u00b0 10\u2019.\nThe above angles placed boat May 2.5 miles S. 82 W. from end of trees and 1.8 miles from Boundary line between end of Rose Spit and Yakin Pt. I informed the skipper he was anchored inside the 3 mile limit, that the weather was fair and calm when he anchored, and was still fair with light S.E. wind and they were both asleep\u2014so I would have to take him to Rupert. Would he use his own engines? Reply\u2014No I am finished I am inside so do what you like; he would not start his engine to heave in his cable. The boat was taken in tow of Rividis 4.45 a.m. proceeding toward Prince Rupert.\nAt Prince Rupert proceedings were commenced which resulted in the May being declared forfeited.\nThe Customs and Fisheries Protection Act, under which proceedings were taken, provides as follows:\u2014\n10. Every fishing ship, vessel or boat which is foreign, or not navigated according to the laws of Great Britain or of Canada, which,\n(a) Not being thereto permitted by any treaty or convention, or by any law of Great Britain, or of Canada for the time being in force, has been found fishing or preparing to fish, or to have been fishing in British waters within three marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks or harbours of Canada, or in or upon the inland waters of Canada;\n(b) has entered such waters for any purpose not permitted by treaty or convention, or by any law of Great Britain or of Canada for the time being in force;\n* * * * *\nshall, together with the tackle, rigging, apparel, furniture, stores and cargo thereof, be forfeited.\nIt is not contended that the May from the time she entered McIntyre Bay until she was seized was fishing or preparing to fish.\nIt is subsection (b) of section 10 that the Crown contends has been violated.\nThat the May was a foreign fishing vessel is admitted. Two questions, therefore, arise in the appeal: (1) When found by Captain Sheppard at anchor in McIntyre Bay, was the May within Canadian territorial waters? (2) If so, had she entered such waters for any purpose not permitted by treaty or convention or by the law of Great Britain or Canada then in force? These are purely questions of fact or inference from fact or of interpretation. The trial judge gave no reasons for \u2018judgment but the formal judgment shews that he found the May to be in British waters when Captain Sheppard boarded her and that she had entered those waters in violation of the above Act.\nWas the May within the three mile limit when seized? The trial judge had before him the evidence of Captain Sheppard that he had taken the sextant angles, which, it is common ground, is the most accurate method of ascertaining location; that he took the angles accurately and that the May was anchored two and a half miles from shore. He had also the evidence of D. S. Godfrey, Lieutenant-Commander in the Royal Canadian Navy, who also took the sextant angles and corroborated the evidence of Captain Sheppard. Commander Godfrey had no connection with, or interest in the Fishery Protection Service. His presence on the Rividis is accounted for by his having been sent to acquire some knowledge of the coast of the Queen Charlotte Islands. Both these men were highly qualified to ascertain the location of any boat by taking the sextant angles. Captain Sheppard also testified that he had asked Knudsen the questions quoted from the log and that the answers there reported were those given by Knudsen.\nBoth Knudsen and Christophersen knew that the sextant angles were being taken to locate the position of their vessel and that its fate might depend on the result arrived at; yet no request was made by either of them to be allowed to verify the angles taken. Furthermore, they both say they took compass bearings which shewed the May to be three and a half miles from shore, yet they made no protest when informed that they were within the three mile limit, nor did they ask Captain Sheppard to log into shore to verify the distance. Knudsen in his evidence admits that when he was asked to start his engine he replied \u201cNo, I think I am through with this boat,\u201d while, according to Captain Sheppard, his reply was \u201cNo, I am finished, I am inside so do what you like.\u201d\nThe conclusion of Captain Sheppard as to the location of the May when seized was questioned at the trial. The defence produced three expert witnesses who took Captain Sheppard\u2019s angles and, by applying them on the chart to \u00e0 point on Tow Hill and one on Argonaut Hill, found the May to be outside of Canadian territorial waters. When asked to explain how, with the same angles, there could be a difference between the location fixed by Captain Sheppard and themselves, they admitted that the difference might arise from his having taken a slightly different point on Argonaut Hill and Tow Hill from those on which they placed their lines on the chart. The discrepancy really arose from the fact that in the log the two hills were mentioned as the points taken. Now Argonaut Hill is situated inland and the top comprises a plateau more than half a mile square, the northwesterly face of which is shewn on the chart to be 535 feet high, while the opposite face is shewn to be 490 feet high. To get the same result it is obvious that each expert must take exactly the same points on Tow Hill and on Argonaut Hill. The defendant\u2019s experts frankly admitted that unless the fixed points taken on the ground were so clearly defined in the log that they could be accurately located on the chart, the man who sighted these fixed points on the ground had an advantage over those who had not seen the hills, as he alone knew the exact points on the hills which had been taken. When asked why he did not define in the log the exact points on those two hills, which he took to get the sextant angles, Captain Sheppard said he did not think it was necessary as every navigating officer taking observations around Tow Hill, Argonaut Hill and the \u201cend of the trees\u201d knew exactly the points which were always taken, and \u201cwould never use the top of Tow Hill for the simple reason that you cannot get such a fine cut on the sextant with the square faced bluff on Argonaut Hill.\u201d The point on Tow Hill which he took was the east side where it drops perpendicularly to the base of the river flat. On Argonaut Hill he took a point on a very conspicuous bluff on the centre of the hill at its highest part\u2014\u201ca peculiar wooded part of the hill that always stands out\u201d when looked at from the position from which he took the angles. Captain MacDonald, one of the defendant\u2019s experts, on being recalled, admitted that, taking the points sighted by Captain Sheppard, the location of the May was within the three mile limit. On this evidence it is impossible to reverse the finding of the trial judge as to the location of the May without disbelieving the evidence of witnesses whom he heard and believed.\nThe next question is: did the May enter Canadian territorial waters for any purpose not permitted by treaty or convention or by the law of Great Britain or of Canada for the time being in force?\nCounsel for the appellant vessel contended that she was permitted to enter Canadian waters under, (1) the Customs Act, section 183, and (2) \u201cThe Convention of 1818\u201d between Great Britain and the United States. Section 183 of the Customs Act reads as follows:\u2014\n183. If any vessel enters any place other than a port of entry, unless from stress of weather or other unavoidable cause, any dutiable goods on board thereof, except those of an innocent owner, shall be seized and forfeited, and the vessel may also be seized, and the master or person in charge thereof shall incur a penalty of eight hundred dollars, if the vessel is worth eight hundred dollars or more, or a penalty not exceeding four hundred dollars, if the value of the vessel is less than eight hundred dollars, and the vessel may be detained until such penalty is paid.\nIt is common ground that this section, although primarily enacted as a customs provision for the protection of the revenue, does, by the exception contained in the words \u201cunless from stress of weather or other unavoidable cause,\u201d give effect to a principle of International Law recognized by both countries, namely, that vessels of one nation will be excused for entering the territory of another if there is an actual necessity for their so doing. It is a well recognized principle, both in this country and in the United States, that the jurisdiction of a nation is exclusive and absolute within its own territory, of which its territorial waters within three marine miles from shore are as clearly a part as the land. All exceptions, therefore, to the full and complete power of a nation within its own territory must be traced to the consent of the nation itself given as a general rule by treaty, convention or statute. From this it follows that each nation has the absolute right to prescribe the conditions upon which the vessels of another nation will be permitted to enter its territorial waters. What we have to do, therefore, is to ascertain what conditions have been prescribed, to define the limits thereof, and then see if the facts, as disclosed by the evidence, bring the May within these limits. The condition prescribed by the Customs Act is \u201cstress of weather or other unavoidable cause.\u201d In this case the appellant vessel must rely for her justification upon \u201cstress of weather,\u201d for the other cause advanced, namely, that it was necessary to seek shelter to repair the engine, does not, in my opinion, merit serious consideration. The only repairing required was to renew the packing of the oil pump, which had become worn, thus causing the pump to leak. The leaking of the pump did not affect its usefulness for feeding the engine with oil, but it resulted in a waste of oil. It in no way affected the sailing of the vessel or made it more dangerous. This is shewn by the fact that Knudsen ran the vessel from, at least, 5 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. with the oil pump in its leaky condition, and stated that if he had found 15 fathoms of water under him instead of 40, when Christophersen took the soundings, he would have gone farther out. The packing of the oil pump was, therefore, not an immediate necessity. Besides, it was Knudsen\u2019s duty, not only to have his vessel seaworthy when he left Ketchikan on the morning of June 3, but to have her in seasonable repair, and, if he was compelled to enter into Canadian territorial waters by reason of his failure to have his vessel in seasonable repair, his failure cannot be designated as an unavoidable cause.\nWhat, then, does \u201cstress of weather\u201d connote?\nIn The Eleanor[1], Sir William Scott said:\nReal and irresistible distress must be at all times a sufficient passport for human beings under any such application of human laws. But if a party is a false mendicant, if he brings into a port a ship or cargo under a pretence which does not exist, the holding out of such a false cause fixes him with a fraudulent purpose. * * * Now it must be an urgent distress; it must be something of grave necessity; such as is spoken of in our books, where a ship is said to be driven in by stress of weather. It is not sufficient to say it was done to avoid a little bad weather, or in consequence of foul winds, the danger must be such as to cause apprehension in the mind of an honest and firm man. I do not mean to say that there must be an actual physical necessity existing at the moment; a moral necessity would justify the act, where, for instance, the ship had sustained previous damage, so as to render it dangerous to the lives of the persons on board to prosecute the voyage: Such a case, though there might be no existing storm, would be viewed with tenderness; but there must be at least a moral necessity. Then again, where the party justifies the act upon the plea of distress, it must not be a distress which he has created himself, by putting on board an insufficient quantity of water or of provisions for such a voyage, for there the distress is only a part of the mechanism of the fraud, and cannot be set up in excuse for it; and in the next place the distress must be proved by the claimant in a clear and satisfactory manner.\nIn The Diana[2], Field J. said:\u2014\nIt is undoubtedly true that a vessel may be in such distress as to justify her in attempting to enter a blockaded port. She may be out of provisions or water, or she may be in a leaking condition, and no other port be of easy access. The case, however, must be one of absolute and uncontrollable necessity; and this must be established beyond reasonable doubt. \u201cNothing less,\u201d says Sir William Scott, \u201cthan an uncontrollable necessity, which admits of no compromise, and cannot be resisted,\u201d will be held a justification of the offence. Any rule less stringent than this would open the door to all sorts of fraud.\nIn The New York[3], Livingston J. said:\u2014\nThe necessity must be urgent, and proceed from such a state of things as may be supposed to produce on the mind of a skilful mariner, a well grounded apprehension of the loss of vessel and cargo, or of the lives of the crew. It is not every injury that may be received in a storm, as the splitting of a sail, the springing of a yard, or a trifling leak, which will excuse a violation of the laws of trade. Such accidents happen in every voyage; and the commerce of no country could be subject to any regulations, if they might be avoided by the setting up of such trivial accidents as these.\nAnd Johnston J., in his dissenting opinion, remarked[4] that it was not questioned that if a vessel in the course of its voyage \u201csustained such damage as rendered it unsafe to keep the sea, she might innocently enter the ports of the United States to repair, and resume her voyage.\u201d\nIn Phelps, James & Co. v. Hill[5], the question was whether the master of a vessel was justified in deviating from his prescribed course. In his judgment Lopes J., at page 614, said:\nA reasonable necessity implies the existence of such a state of things as, having regard to the interests of all concerned, would properly influence the decision of a reasonably competent and skilful master.\nA perusal of the above authorities leads to the conclusion that an entry by a foreign vessel into Canadian waters cannot be justified on the ground of \u201cstress of weather\u201d unless the weather is such as to produce in the mind of a reasonably competent and skilful master, possessing courage and firmness, a well grounded bona fide apprehension that if he remains outside the territorial waters he will put in jeopardy his vessel and cargo. In every case the questions whether the master fairly and honestly on reasonable ground believed it necessary to take shelter, and whether he exercised reasonable skill, competence and courage in the circumstances, are questions of fact for the tribunal whose duty it is to find the facts.\nThe evidence in this case does not shew any necessity whatever for entering Canadian waters, much less any apprehension on the part of Knudsen that if he continued his voyage he would be risking the loss of his vessel. On the afternoon of June 3, Christophersen says they were off Zayas Island to the south and west, and were opposite Dundas Island, and passed two or three fishing vessels going north towards Ketchikan. One of them was the Queen City, whose captain, Thorgersen, testified in favour of the appellant. The wind was then blowing from the southeast and the other vessels were heading for American territory and running before the wind. Thorgersen says that his boat was getting the sea over her stern once in a while. These boats experienced no difficulty in going with the wind, so why should the May? Furthermore, if Knudsen thought there was any danger in continuing his voyage, all he had to do was to run behind Zayas Island, or Dundas Island, and wait until the wind subsided. Instead, however, he sailed southwest for McIntyre Bay. In following that course he was crossing the sea running almost in its trough for a distance nearly as far as that required to take him to Cape Chacon. If the waves passed over his stern when running before the wind it is difficult to understand how he could escape them by taking them on his side. In addition there is the admission of Knudsen that when he was two miles off Rose Spit buoy the wind was moderating and that the weather was \u201cpretty good\u201d when he anchored.\nThe answers given by Knudsen to the questions put to him by Captain Sheppard and recorded in the log shew that his real reason for going into McIntyre Bay was that it was more comfortable in its sheltered waters than it would have been outside the three mile limit. That there was no necessity for taking shelter is shewn by the fact that outside, some ten or twelve miles from shore, there were, according to Captain Sheppard and Commander Godfrey, 18 or 20 trawlers fishing, between 5 and 7 p.m., and that at 7 p.m. they appeared to Commander Godfrey to have anchored. It was for the trial judge to pass upon the evidence before him and say whether or not the proper inference to be drawn from it was that there existed at the time such \u201cstress of weather\u201d that the May was justified in entering Canadian territorial waters for shelter. His finding was that none existed and, in my opinion, that finding should be affirmed.\nCounsel for the appellant argued that even if the term \u201cstress of weather\u201d was held to mean an uncontrollable necessity when applied to merchant ships, it should not be given that meaning when applied to fishing vessels, as fishermen were \u201cwards of civilization and entitled to favourable treatment.\u201d The statute makes no such distinction and I am unable to see any good reason why fishing vessels should not comply with the statute. The owners or operators of these vessels carry on their business for profit and, in this case, in competition with Canadian fishermen. They should, therefore, be held to a strict observance of the conditions which the statute prescribes for their entry into Canadian waters.\nIt is also claimed on behalf of the appellant that the May had a right to enter Canadian waters under article 1 of the \u201cConvention respecting Fisheries and Boundary Lines,\u201d etc., concluded between Great Britain and the United States on October 20, 1818, which, it is contended, applies to the Pacific coast of Canada. Article I of the Convention contains the following:\u2014\nAnd the United States hereby renounce, forever, any liberty heretofore enjoyed or claimed by the inhabitants thereof to take, dry, or cure fish on or within three marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks, or harbours of His Britannic Majesty\u2019s dominions in America, not included within the above mentioned limits; Provided, however, that the American fishermen shall be admitted to enter such bays or harbours for the purpose of shelter and of repairing damages therein, of purchasing wood, and of obtaining water, and for no other purpose whatever. But they shall be under such restrictions as may be necessary to prevent their taking, drying, or curing fish therein, or in any other manner whatever abusing the privileges hereby reserved to them.\nTo properly understand this article it is necessary to refer to the treaty made at Paris between the two nations in September, 1783. By article 1 of that treaty Great Britain recognized the independence of the United States. Article 2 defined the boundaries of the United States and fixed the boundary line between the two countries from the Atlantic Ocean westerly to the Lake of the Woods. By article 3 it was agreed that the people of the United States, should continue to enjoy the fisheries of Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence and at all other places in the sea where the inhabitants of both countries used theretofore to fish, and also that they should have liberty to take fish on the British coast generally, and to dry and cure fish on the unsettled bays, harbours and creeks of Nova Scotia, Magdalen and Labrador.\nDifferences arose between the two countries as to the extent of these liberties, which differences continued until the war of 1812. After that war Great Britain claimed that the liberties were abrogated by the war, while the United States Government contended that they still existed. To settle the dispute a new agreement was entered into by the Convention of 1818. Under that convention the right to take fish, granted by article 3 of the treaty of 1783, was continued, but the liberty to fish within three marine miles of the coasts, bays, creeks or harbours of His Britannic Majesty in America, except in certain specified places, was, by the American Government, renounced forever, but subject to the proviso of article 1 quoted above. The Convention also fixed the boundary between the two countries, west from the Lake of the Woods to Stony (Rocky) Mountains at the 49th parallel of north latitude. Article 3 of the Convention, in part, reads as follows:\u2014\nIt is agreed that any country that may be claimed by either party on the north-west coast of America, westward of the Stony Mountains, shall, together with its harbours, bays, and creeks, and the navigation of all rivers within the same, be free and open for the term of ten years from the date of the signature of the present convention, to the vessels, citizens, and subjects of the two powers.\nIn 1827 the provisions of article 3 were extended indefinitely. In 1846 the two nations entered into a treaty defining the boundary line between them from the Rocky Mountains, where it had been fixed by the Convention of 1818, to the Pacific Ocean, at the 49th parallel of north latitude. All north of that line to parallel 54\u00b0 40\u2019 was awarded to Great Britain, and all south of it to the United States. It was not until the ratification of this treaty that the sovereignty of Great Britain to any part of the Pacific Slope, north of the 49th parallel of latitude, was recognized by the United States. This is admitted in the appellant\u2019s factum, where the following appears:\u2014\nIt should be noted that Article III of the \u201cConvention of 1818\u201d was passed without prejudice to any claim of either party to the territory of the coast of the North Pacific. This did not mean that the territory was \u201cthen almost wholly terra incognita.\u201d (The King v. The Valiant, supra[6]) but on the contrary it meant that the territory was claimed by both United States and Great Britain and was finally settled as the property of Great Britain from Lat. 49\u00b0 Northward to 54\u00b0 40\u2019 including the locus in question in this case.\nIn view of the fact that at the date of the \u201cConvention of 1818\u201d the United States had not recognized the sovereignty of Great Britain to the Pacific slope, it is, in my opinion, impossible to hold that the reference to the \u201ccoasts, bays, creeks, or harbours of His Britannic Majesty\u2019s dominions in America,\u201d contained in article 1 of the \u201cConvention,\u201d was intended by either party to apply to the Pacific coast. I, therefore, agree with the conclusion reached by Mr. Justice Martin in The King v. The Valiant6, that the \u201cConvention of 1818\u201d did not apply to the Pacific waters so far as fisheries were concerned.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Savage & Keith.\nSolicitors for the respondent: MacNeill, Pratt, MacDougall & Morrison.\n[1] (1809) Edwards\u2019 Admiralty Reports, 135, at 159, 160 and 161.\n[2] (1868) 7 Wallace, 354, at 360-361.\n[3] (1818) 3 Wheaton, 59, at 68.\n[4] Ibid, at 75.\n[5] [1891] 1 Q.B. 605.\n[6] (1914) 15 Can.

A want of bona fides would abrogate any right or privilege to shelter given by the statute. Further, weaknesses in a vessel may be such (as instanced in certain respects in the present case, as, e.g., glass of inadequate thickness in pilot house windows a small height from the sea, constituting a special danger from waves) that any distress arising from them should be deemed a distress created by the owner or master himself (The Eleanor, Edwards, 135, at 161), and not due to \u201cstress of weather or other unavoidable cause\u201d (Customs Act, s. 183).\nThe Convention of October 20, 1818, between Great Britain and the United States (respecting fisheries and boundary lines) has no application to Canadian territorial waters on the Pacific Coast, so far as fisheries are concerned (The May v. The King, ante, p. 374). Even if it had, the defendant vessels could claim no privilege under it, as the only permission to take shelter in Canadian waters given by the proviso to article 1 thereof (or by 59. Geo. III, c. 38, Imp., passed to sanction the Convention) is permission to enter \u201cbays or harbours,\u201d and the place where they were seized was not shewn to be a bay or harbour.\nAPPEAL by the defendant vessels from the judgment of Martin J., Local Judge in Admiralty, in the Exchequer Court of Canada, British Columbia Admiralty District, holding that the vessels, foreign fishing vessels within the meaning of the Customs and Fisheries Protection Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 43, had violated s. 10 of said Act, in that each vessel, (as pronounced in the formal judgment) \u201cat the time of her seizure in British waters, had entered British waters within three marine miles of the coast of Canada for a purpose not permitted by treaty or convention, or by any law of Great Britain or of Canada for the time being in force\u201d; the learned judge holding that, under the particular circumstances, there was no \u201cstress of weather or other unavoidable cause\u201d within the true meaning of s. 183 of the Customs Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 42, warranting such entry; and condemning the vessels and their tackle, rigging, apparel, furniture, stores and cargo as forfeited to His Majesty.\nThe three actions had been tried together. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal in each case was dismissed with costs.\nWm. Savage for the appellants.\nD. L. McCarthy K.C. and J. E. Read K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014These three cases were heard together before Mr. Justice Martin in the Exchequer Court of Canada, British Columbia Admiralty Division, who held that each vessel was a foreign fishing vessel which had entered Canadian territorial waters for a purpose not permitted by treaty or convention or by any law of Great Britain or Canada, in violation of section 10 of the Customs and Fisheries Protection Act, cap. 43, R.S.C., 1927.\nOn the morning of June 18, 1930, between 1.30 and 2 a.m., Captain Sheppard of the fisheries patrol launch Rividis found five vessels at anchor in Canadian territorial waters on the east side of Rose Spit about three-quarters of a mile from shore. He boarded each in turn and ordered the master of each to come on board the Rividis with his ship\u2019s papers and manifest. There he questioned each master separately and entered the material questions and answers in the log. Lieutenant Commander Barnes of the Canadian Navy, who was at the time on board the Rividis, was present at the examination of each master; heard the questions asked and the answers given, and saw Captain Sheppard enter question and answer in the log. Immediately thereafter he read what Captain Sheppard had written and testified that the questions and answers appearing in the log were the questions put to and the answers given by the several masters. After questioning the masters of the respective vessels, Captain Sheppard directed three of the vessels, namely, the Sunrise, the Queen City and the Tillie M., to proceed to Prince Rupert. Arriving there the vessels were put in the hands of the customs officers and proceedings were commenced which resulted in their forfeiture. The other two vessels, the Frederick and the Anne, were not seized, as the explanation of their masters for entering Canadian waters was deemed satisfactory.\nIt is not disputed that the three vessels were registered in the United States of America, nor that they were within three-quarters of a mile of the Canadian shore when they were seized by Captain Sheppard. The contention of their counsel is that they were permitted to enter Canadian waters (1) by virtue of section 183 of the Customs Act, and (2) under article 1 of the \u201cConvention Respecting Fisheries and Boundary Lines, etc.,\u201d concluded between Great Britain and the United States on October 20, 1918.\nFor the reasons set out in the judgment of this court in The Ship May v. The King (delivered herewith)1, we are of opinion that the Convention of 1818 has no application to the territorial waters of Canada on the Pacific coast, so far as fisheries are concerned. But even if it had, not one of these vessels could claim any privilege under it. By article 1 of the Convention the United States renounced forever the liberty theretofore enjoyed or claimed by the inhabitants thereof to fish within three marine miles of the coasts, bays, creeks or harbours of His Britannic Majesty\u2019s dominions in America, not included in the limits mentioned. But it was provided that American fishermen should be permitted to enter such \u201cbays or harbours for the purpose of shelter and of repairing damages therein, of purchasing wood, and of obtaining water, and for no other purpose whatever.\u201d The only permission to take shelter in Canadian waters given by the proviso of article 1, or by the Imperial statute, 59 Geo. III, cap 38 (which was passed to sanction the Convention) is permission to enter the bays and harbours. Now the place where these three vessels were seized is not shewn on the chart or established by the evidence to have been either a bay or a harbour, and if it is not there is no provision either of treaty or statute which authorizes entry for the purpose of shelter. Moreover the absence from the proviso of article 1, of the words \u201ccoasts\u201d and \u201ccreeks,\u201d which appear in conjunction with bays and harbours in the first part of the article, conclusively indicates that the privileges conferred as to bays and harbours were not meant to extend to coasts not included in that description. The sole question in this appeal, therefore, is: were these vessels, or any one of them, permitted to enter Canadian waters by virtue of section 183 of the Customs Act, which inferentially permits entry by a foreign vessel when \u201cstress of weather or other unavoidable cause\u201d compels her to seek shelter therein.\nOn the authorities referred to in the judgment in The Ship May v. The King2, we came to the conclusion that \u201cstress of weather\u201d which would justify a foreign fishing vessel entering Canadian waters\u2014on the ground of stress of weather\u2014must be such a condition of atmosphere and sea as would produce in the mind of a reasonably competent and skilful master, possessing courage and firmness, a well grounded bona fide apprehension that if he remains outside the Canadian waters he will put in jeopardy his vessel and cargo. Does the evidence disclose the existence of such a state of atmosphere and sea on June 17, 1930, in the vicinity of Rose Spit, as would justify the entry of a foreign vessel into Canadian waters on the ground of \u201cstress of weather\u201d?\nThe learned trial judge had before him the evidence of Captain Sheppard and Lieutenant Commander Barnes as to the condition of the weather on June 17, and the early morning of June 18, when these vessels were seized. He had also their evidence as to the statements made by the master of each vessel as set out in the log and the statements of the several masters in the witness box at the trial, which were, in some material respects, in conflict therewith. Further he had certain facts, established by uncontradicted evidence, from which he was entitled to draw inferences as to the credibility of the witnesses.\nCaptain Sheppard and Lieutenant Commander Barnes testified that, on June 17, they left Skidgate and came up the easterly side of Graham Island, running from three to five miles off shore; that from one o\u2019clock in the afternoon until the vessels in question in this appeal were boarded the wind was \u201clight to fresh westerly, sea smooth, weather clear, barometer steady,\u201d and that there was no necessity for any vessel to seek protection from the weather. At 10.30 p.m. they anchored off the east coast of Rose Point and saw five vessels about two or two and a half miles farther north, likewise anchored within half or three-quarters of a mile from the shore. There were also two other vessels, similar in type to those seized, anchored outside the three mile limit. These were later inspected by Captain Sheppard and found to be, one a Canadian trawler, and the other an American. Their crews were then all asleep and the boats were riding peacefully at anchor. Both these witnesses testify that Graham Island furnished protection to vessels as far out as six or eight miles from shore.\nL. Sandberg, master of the Sunrise, and his partner, Erick Wilson, testified that they were fishing off Rose Spit buoy on June 15, and anchored that night on the fishing grounds, but, about 3.30 a.m. of the 16th, as the wind began to blow hard from the west, they pulled up anchor and came to the east side of Rose Spit for shelter, being protected from the force of the waves by Sand Island; they further testified that they remained there until 8 a.m. on the 17th, in the belief that it was not safe to be outside the three mile limit. On the morning of the 17th, being under the impression that they could not remain more than twenty-four hours in Canadian waters, they left for the fishing grounds north of Rose Spit buoy. After going eight or nine miles they turned and came back as the sea was too rough for fishing and, according to their statement, it was not safe for the vessel to remain outside. They got back about 2 p.m., having been out at sea for five hours. According to Captain Sheppard and Lieutenant Commander Barnes, Sandberg stated, when being questioned on board the Rividis, that he anchored on the east side of the point at 1 p.m., on the 17th, and, when asked if he could not with safety have run back and forth four miles off shore, replied \u201cNo doubt I could.\u201d This was denied by Sandberg in his evidence.\nCaptain Jepsen of the Tillie M. testified that he anchored in the fishing ground north of the Rose Spit buoy on the night of the 15th, but came in for shelter on the morning of the 16th, and remained there until 8.30 on the morning of the 17th, when he went out to the fishing grounds again, two or three miles north of the buoy. He started to fish but found the sea too rough, so he came back to the anchorage about 2 p.m., having also been out some five hours. According to the entries in the log Jepsen, when questioned on board the Rividis, stated that he had anchored at Rose Spit, \u201con the 16th p.m.,\u201d because \u201cit was blowing too hard to lay off shore.\u201d\nJ. E. Thorgersen, owner and master of the Queen City, and his assistant, Jens Blyseth, testified that they left Ketchikan on the morning of June 17 to go to Seattle to get a new block for their engine, but that they intended to fish on the way. They set a course from the east side of Duke Island for Bonila Island fishing grounds on the east side of Hecate Straits, but, in the afternoon, altered their course to the southwest so as to reach the east side of Rose Spit; that, when about fifteen miles from Rose Spit buoy, the wind was blowing hard and the sea was rough; that when they saw Rose Spit buoy they turned south and ran for six or seven miles outside the three mile limit but, fearing they might be swamped, they turned and ran in close to shore, and anchored at 9.15 p.m. According to the entries in the log, Thorgersen told Captain Sheppard that he anchored at Rose Spit at 10 a.m. on the 17th June; that the weather was stormy and wind increasing. When asked if he thought he could have run up and down the coast four miles off shore with safety, his answer was, \u201cYes I think I could if everything worked all right.\u201d\nAll these witnesses for the defence claimed that it was too rough to remain outside the three mile limit in safety.\nIn corroboration of the evidence of Captain Sheppard and Lieutenant Commander Barnes, the trial judge had before him the admission of Captain Jepsen that, when he was attempting to fish on the 17th, he did not consider himself in any danger; and the statement of the master of the Frederick that he did not think his boat would have been in danger of swamping had he stayed off shore, but that it would have been uncomfortable. He also had the fact that, on the afternoon and evening of the 17th, the Queen City ran right across Dixon\u2019s Entrance with the wind on her quarter, going through what is known to be the roughest waters in those parts and at a time when she was supposed to be in a crippled condition by reason of her split engine block. Her master, Thorgersen, when questioned as to the state of the weather when he anchored would not say that it was then any worse than it had been at 6 p.m. The Queen City was the smallest of all these vessels, having a capacity of only eight tons net, and having, when loaded with ice as she was that day, both at her stern and amidships, a free board of only 6 or 8 inches. In addition the trial judge had before him the significant fact that outside the three mile limit and directly east of these vessels, two other fishing vessels were riding at anchor, although one of them, the Canadian vessel, had a perfect right to be within the three mile limit if she thought it desirable. The masters of these vessels evidently had no apprehension of loss or damage to their vessels or danger to themselves if they anchored outside the three mile limit, and the Canadian vessel could not have found it even uncomfortable or she would have exercised her right to draw into shore. Whether there was \u201cstress of weather\u201d within the meaning of section 183 on the afternoon and evening of June 17, was a question of fact depending upon the credibility of the witnesses. The trial judge is known as an able and careful judge, with more than thirty years\u2019 experience in cases similar to those before us, and he accepted the evidence submitted on behalf of the Crown in preference to that submitted on behalf of the several vessels. In Ruddy v. Toronto Eastern Railway Company3, the Privy Council said:\u2014\nBut upon questions of fact an Appeal Court will not interfere with the decision of the judge who has seen the witnesses and has been able, with the impression thus formed fresh in his mind, to decide between their contending evidence, unless there is some good and special reason to throw doubt upon the soundness of his conclusions.\nThe trial judge found that there was no stress of weather or other sufficient cause to justify the entry of these vessels into Canadian territorial waters and, in our opinion, the evidence amply supports the finding, which should be affirmed.\nThe conclusion which we have reached is sufficient to dispose of the appeal in favour of the respondent, but as, on the argument, great stress was laid by the appellants on the contention that \u201cthe extent of the stress of weather should be considered in relation to the class of vessels involved,\u201d it may not be inadvisable to make some reference thereto. It was argued on behalf of the appellants that these fishing vessels \u201chave some weaknesses which make them vulnerable when the waves break over them.\u201d These weaknesses are specified in the factum as follows:\u2014\n(a) They have a low free board, i.e., they sit low in the water.\n(b) They carry no navigating sails, the only sail being a small canvas called a \u201cleg of mutton sail\u201d which is used to assist in steadying the vessel from rolling in the seaway.\n(c) The Tillie M. presented a weak glass front pilot house to the sea which being only a small height from the sea constitutes a special danger in case of waves.\n(d) They have a large open cockpit at the stern of the vessel in which they clean and dress their fish * * * and when the waves come over the vessel the cockpit fills and settles the vessel down in the sea at the stern making it unsteerable and dangerous.\n(e) They were powered by diesel or gasoline engines having very delicate parts which are liable to get out of order in storm.\n(\u0192) These fishing vessels must of necessity carry a large weight in ice for preservation of fish, of fuel for their engines and of water and supplies. * * * They are thus too heavily loaded to stand severe storms.\n(g) Each vessel is manned by a master and fisherman, one of whom usually navigates the vessel and the other operates the engine. These men fish from daylight to dark so that if riding out a storm at night is added to their duties they must suffer from exhaustion.\nOn the other hand counsel for the Crown strongly urged that the employment for fishing of vessels which present these weaknesses is nothing more or less than a ruse on the part of the owners thereof to occupy Canadian waters under the pretence that their vessels cannot remain outside with safety, and that they then either fish in these waters or use them as a base from which to compete with Canadian fishermen on the international fishing grounds.\nIn both Great Britain and the United States it is recognized that the jurisdiction of a nation is exclusive and absolute within its own territory which includes the waters within three marine miles from the shore. No other nation can claim jurisdiction as a matter of right within the territorial waters of an independent state. It follows, therefore, that the citizens of a foreign state cannot claim any right or privilege in Canadian waters except such as has been given to them by the British or Canadian Governments. In The Eleanor4, Sir William Scott enunciated the principle which, in our opinion, applies to the weaknesses of the vessels as above set out. He says:\u2014\nThen again, where the party justifies the act upon the plea\u2019 of distress, it must not be a distress which he has created himself, by putting on board an insufficient quantity of water or of provisions for such a voyage, for there the distress is only a part of the mechanism of the fraud, and cannot be set up in excuse for it; and in the next place the distress must be proved by the claimant in a clear and satisfactory manner.\nCanada has nothing to say as to the class of vessel which the citizens of a foreign state may employ to carry on fishing operations outside of Canadian territorial waters. If, however, a foreign fishing vessel enters Canadian waters for shelter against weather which is known to prevail on the fishing grounds, and the vessel is so constructed that it cannot with safety remain outside the three mile limit in such weather, there might arise a suspicion of want of bona fides on the part of the master or owner in bringing a vessel of that class into such seas to fish. A want of bona fides would abrogate any right or privilege to shelter given by the statute.\nApart from any distress which may result from the employment of vessels unsuited to the seas or weather which prevail in Dixon\u2019s Entrance or Hecate Straits, any distress arising from other \u201cweaknesses\u201d for which consideration is claimed, is, in our opinion, a distress created by the owner or master himself which it is in his power to prevent and therefore cannot be said to be due to \u201cstress of weather or other unavoidable cause.\u201d\nThe frivolous character of these \u201cweaknesses\u201d is illustrated by the contention that the \u201cTillie M. presented a weak glass front pilot house which constituted a special danger in case of waves.\u201d A perusal of the evidence of P. C. Jepsen, her master, shews that when the vessel was built the builder put square window glass 12 x 14 in the three windows of the house over the engine room, instead of, as he contends it should have been, port lights, i.e., glass of the thickness of port lights. Jepsen has sailed this vessel for three years without harm, and he says that the window glass is all that he is afraid of in a storm. If he had any real fear as to the safety of his vessel, we think it would have occurred to him sometime during those three years to take out the window glass and put thicker glass in its place.\nThe evidence in these cases shews that the boats could have remained outside the three mile limit in safety even directly east of the place where they were anchored. Farther to the south they would have been protected as far out as six or eight miles from the shore because the island is higher to the south than at the point where they anchored. It is true it might not have been as comfortable for sleeping outside the three mile limit, owing to the motion of the sea, as in the quiet waters near the shore. The statute, however, has not provided that foreign vessels may enter Canadian waters if it is more comfortable-there than outside. From a westerly wind, such as existed on June 17, shelter outside the three mile limit can always be found by running south in Hecate Straits on the east side of Graham Island and, in our opinion, there was no necessity to approach within three miles of the coast for shelter or by reason of stress of weather.\nThese appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Savage & Keith.\nSolicitors for the respondent: MacNeill, Pratt, MacDougall & Morrison.\n1 Ante, p. 374.\n2 Ante, p. 374.\n3 (1917) 116 L.T. 257, at 258.\n4 (1809) Edwards\u2019 Admiralty Reports, 135, at 161.\n"}

No amount was claimed for damages. The action was dismissed. Appellant appealed to this Court (without obtaining leave under s. 83 of the Exchequer Court Act). Respondent moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction, on the ground that there was no \u201cactual amount in controversy\u201d in the action. Appellant replied by affidavit that the registration of the trade-mark had \u201caggrieved\u201d appellant \u201cin an amount exceeding $500.\u201d\nHeld: Assuming, but not deciding, that the words \u201cactual amount in controversy\u201d in s. 82 of the Exchequer Court Act, do not imply that there must be a sum of money exceeding $500 actually in dispute, but that a claim for property or rights of which the value exceeds $500, if actually involved in the action, suffices to give this Court jurisdiction to entertain the appeal under s. 82, and that such value may be proved by affidavit, yet appellant\u2019s affidavit was insufficient for the purpose, because, while appellant might have sustained the amount of damages sworn to as the result of registration of the trade-mark, it did not follow that the value of its right to have the trade-mark expunged exceeded $500, and that was what required proof, to bring this case (on the assumption aforesaid) within s. 82.\nMOTION on behalf of the respondent for an order quashing the appeal, which was brought from the judgment of Audette J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing the appellant\u2019s action, which was for the expunging from the register of a specific trade-mark registered by the respondent.

That the registration of the said Trade-Mark by the Respondent as aforesaid has aggrieved the Appellant (Petitioner) herein in an amount exceeding Five Hundred ($500) dollars.\nWhile the appellant may have sustained the amount of damages sworn to as the result of the registration of the trade-mark by the respondent, it does not at all follow that the value of his right to have such trade-mark expunged exceeds the sum of five hundred dollars; yet that is what he would be required to swear to in order to bring this case within s. 82 of the Exchequer Court Act, there being no amount claimed for damages, but merely a claim for the expunging of the respondent\u2019s trade-mark. As I have indicated, we shall assume the proof of value of the right in question can be made by affidavit, and that, if such value be shown to exceed $500, an appeal lies to this Court under s. 82; but, that not having been done, the alternative was to obtain leave to appeal from a judge of this Court, under s. 83. This has not been done.\nWhether the time can now be extended and leave granted by virtue of such extension, under s. 83, is a question for the consideration of the appellant. (Goodison v. McNab (1).)\nMeantime, and as matters now stand, the Court is without jurisdiction to hear the appeal and the motion to quash must be granted with costs.\nMotion granted with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Henderson, Herridge & Gowling.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Smart & Biggar.\n[1] [1931] Ex.

The company covenanted to commence and continue drilling operations, and, on discovery of oil, to instal machinery for pumping it, etc. It struck oil, sold all the oil produced in 1927, and paid to appellant, as being the royalty under the agreement, one-tenth of the gross proceeds thereof. The question now in issue was whether or not appellant, in respect of the amount so received by her as royalty, was assessable by the Crown for income tax under the Income War Tax Act, 1917 (Dom.) as amended. Appellant was not a dealer in or in the business of buying and selling oil lands or leases. Held: Appellant was not so assessable. The amount in question was not income to her within the meaning of the Act. Jones v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue, [1920] 1 K.B. 711, distinguished, having regard to the subject matter and statutes involved. Judgment of the Exchequer Court (Audette J.), [1930] Ex. C.R. 229, reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Audette J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding the appellant liable for income tax with respect to certain monies received by her as royalty under an agreement.\nBy agreement dated April 15, 1925, the appellant sold certain land to a company, which, in consideration of the sale, agreed to pay to the appellant a certain cash sum upon the execution of the agreement by the company, and to issue to her a certain number of shares of the company\u2019s capital stock, and further agreed\nin consideration of the said sale to deliver to the order of the said vendor (appellant) the royalty hereby reserved to the vendor, namely: ten per cent of all the petroleum, natural gas, and oil, produced and saved from the said lands free of costs to the said vendor on the said premises. * * *\nThe material clauses of the agreement are sufficiently set out or described in the judgment now reported. (Also the agreement is set out in full in the judgment of the Exchequer Court[2]) During the fall of 1926 the company struck oil in commercial quantities on the land.\nThe whole of the oil produced in 1927 (the year in question) was sold by the company and out of the monies received from the sale of the oil (before the company deducted expenses or made any reduction therefrom) one-tenth of the gross proceeds were paid over to the appellant.\nIn respect of the money so paid over to the appellant, she was assessed for income tax under the Income War Tax Act, 1917 (Dom.) as amended. She appealed from the assessment on the ground that the money so received by her was not taxable income. The Minister of National Revenue affirmed the assessment on the ground that under and by virtue of the agreement between the appellant and the company the appellant\nsecured unto herself an income, fluctuating annually in accordance with the production of oil and that the monies realized from the sale of such oil either by herself or through her agent or by contract or otherwise, such monies coming to her constitute taxable income and she is taxable in respect thereof, subject however, to adjustment as to depletion * * *\nThe appellant appealed from the decision of the Minister, which appeal was dismissed by Audette J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada[3]. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted by a judge of this Court.\nAt the opening of the trial in the Exchequer Court, the following facts were agreed upon by counsel for the parties:\n1. The Appellant in 1902 purchased from the Canadian Pacific Railway the lands referred to in the hereinafter referred to Agreement along with other lands, the whole for the purpose of conducting ranching operations thereon. The Appellant was not and is not a dealer in or in the business of buying and selling oil lands or leases.\n2. The Appellant was in 1927 and is now a resident in Canada.\n3. The Respondent determined the income of the Appellant to be in the sum of $9,570.41, being monies received as \u201cRoyalties\u201d under the Agreement hereinafter referred to.\n4. Vulcan Oils Limited was and is a Company incorporated on the 13th day of April, 1925, under the laws of the Province of Alberta, organized and operated for the purpose of drilling for and procuring the production and vending of oil.\n5. That Vulcan Oils Limited and the Appellant entered into an Agreement dated the 15th day of April, 1925, a true copy of which has been filed with and forms part of the records of this Court.\n6. That of the property referred to in the said Agreement the Appellant was the owner in fee simple except as to the coal therein and thereunder.\n7. That in accordance with the said Agreement Vulcan Oils Limited entered upon the property as in the Agreement described and commenced the operations of drilling for oil with equipment and in a manner satisfactory to the Appellant.\n8. That during the fall of 1926 Vulcan Oils Limited struck oil (as referred to in the contract) \u201cin Commercial quantities on the said lands.\u201d\n9. A transfer of the petroleum, natural gas or oil has not been effected and the Appellant is still the owner in fee simple of the said lands except as to coal.\n10. That due to the mining operations the whole of the oil produced in the year 1927, the year in question, was sold by Vulcan Oils Limited and out of the monies received from the sale of the oil (before the Company deducted expenses or made any reduction therefrom) one-tenth of the gross proceeds were paid over to the Appellant. 11. That the oil produced by Vulcan Oils Limited is not in fact physically divided by the Company nor is it sold in two distinct portions of 90 per cent and 10 per cent, but the whole is handled in bulk. Vulcan Oils Limited never in fact delivered any of the actual oil to the Appellant, but has in fact delivered (as per the Agreement), \u201cto the order of the said Vendor the royalties hereby reserved to the Vendor\u201d (the Appellant), the delivery in fact being effected by payment in cash.\n12. That the Appellant, or her Agent, has in fact from time to time entered upon and viewed the operations and workings of Vulcan Oils Limited as to the operations of the mining of oil on the property.\n13. The Appellant upon entering into the said Agreement received the sum of $5,000 in cash and 25,000 shares of Vulcan Oils Limited at a par value of one dollar each, as fully paid up and since the production of oil and the sale thereof has been receiving \u201croyalties\u201d under the contract.\nBy the judgment now reported the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was allowed with costs throughout.\nH. S. Patterson K.C. for the appellant.\nC. Fraser Elliott K.C. and W. S. Fisher for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014This is a tax appeal, depending upon the meaning and application of the Income War Tax Act, c. 28 of 1917, as amended.\nThe case came before Audette J., of the Exchequer Court of Canada[4], upon appeal from the decision of the Minister of National Revenue, and was heard upon admissions.\nBy agreement under seal of 15th April, 1925, the appellant, therein called the vendor, of the first part, who was then the owner in fee simple of the lands to which the agreement relates, agreed with Vulcan Oils, Limited, therein called the company, of the second part, upon the recital that the appellant had agreed to sell to the company the land described as follows, that\nThe Vendor hereby sells, assigns, transfers and sets over unto the Company, its successors and assigns, all her right, title and interest, in and to the following property; namely, the South twenty acres of the North West quarter of Section Thirteen (13) Township Twenty (20) Range Three (3) West of the Fifth Meridian, which includes all mines and minerals, on, in or under the said lands. Subject to the provisos, conditions and royalties hereinafter reserved. The company, in consideration of the sale, agreed to pay to the vendor the sum of $5,000 in cash, upon the execution of the agreement by the company, and to issue to the vendor, or her nominee, 25,000 shares of the company\u2019s capital stock of the par value of $1 each, fully paid up.\nAnd, by clause 3, it is stipulated that\nThe Company hereby further agrees in consideration of the said sale to deliver to the order of the said Vendor the royalty hereby reserved to the Vendor, namely: ten per cent. of all the petroleum, natural gas, and oil, produced and saved from the said lands free of costs to the said vendor on the said premises. And the said petroleum, natural gas and oil shall be delivered under the instructions and upon the method decided by the Vendor, and the Company further covenants and agrees that it will deliver to the said Vendor the before mentioned percentage of petroleum, natural gas and oil saved on the said land at least once in every thirty days and will not sell or remove any petroleum, natural gas or oil from the said premises until the said percentage or share thereof belonging to the Vendor shall have been delivered as aforesaid.\nBy clause 5, the company covenanted to proceed forthwith to obtain standard drilling machinery, fully equipped; to commence drilling operations upon the lands as expeditiously as possible, \u201cand to continue such drilling operations without interruption, except as may be unavoidable, until oil and\/or gas in commercial quantities is struck or to a minimum depth of 4,500 feet.\u201d\nBy clause 6, the company covenanted, upon oil or petroleum being discovered, to instal and maintain the necessary machinery for pumping or procuring and delivering the oil or petroleum in pipes, reservoirs or tanks, and to carry on the operations.\nClause 7 reads as follows:\nIn the event of oil or gas being discovered in commercial quantities on the said lands the Vendor as part of the consideration for this Agreement, covenants to transfer to the said Company by good and sufficient transfer in fee simple the said twenty acres of land freed and discharged from all encumbrances and also shall transfer to the said Company by good and sufficient transfer in fee simple freed and discharged from all encumbrances the South twenty acres of the North West Quarter of Section twenty-four (24) Township twenty (20) Range three (3) West of the 5th Meridian and such transfers shall be completed and delivered forthwith after oil or gas is discovered in commercial quantities by the said Company, reserving always however to the Vendor the said royalty of ten per cent of all petroleum, natural gas and oil in respect to the said South twenty acres of the N.W. \u00bc of Section 13, Township 20, Range 3, West of the 5th Meridian and also free access on and over all said lands described in this paragraph to an extent not exceeding three trails and the location of the said trails shall be selected by the Vendor. It will be observed that clause 3, quoted above, by which, as well as by clause 7, the royalty is said to be reserved, introduces a covenant, on the part of the company, by way of further consideration for the sale; and that the company thereby agrees to deliver to the vendor, on the premises, ten per cent, of the petroleum, natural gas and oil produced and saved from the lands sold, free of cost to the vendor; the delivery to be made at least once in every thirty days; and this suggests a question as to whether the consideration or so-called royalty, which consists of ten per cent, of the minerals recovered, is validly reserved; for, it is said in Sheppard\u2019s Touchstone (80), para. 10:\nIf a man grant land, yielding or paying money or some such like thing [as a rose, a pound of cummin, etc.] yearly, [or at any other period] this is a good reservation. But if the grantee covenant to pay such a sum of money, or to do such a thing yearly, this is no good reservation, but a covenant to pay a sum of money in gross, and not as a rent, [but whether a clause shall amount to a reservation, or to a covenant, is frequently a question of construction].\nOne is concerned to know whether the appellant has acquired that which is taxable as income; and, for the purposes of the Act, \u201cincome,\u201d as defined by the relevant provisions of section 3(1), means\nThe annual net profit or gain or gratuity, whether ascertained and capable of computation as being wages, salary, or other fixed amount, or unascertained as being fees or emoluments, or as being profits from a trade or commercial or financial or other business or calling, directly or indirectly received by a person from any office or employment, or from any profession or calling, or from any trade, manufacture or business, as the case may be; and shall include the interest, dividends or profits directly or indirectly received from money at interest upon any security or without security, or from stocks, or from any other investment, and, whether such gains or profits are divided or distributed or not, and also the annual profit or gain from any other source, with the following exemptions and deductions:\u2014\n(a) such reasonable allowance as may be allowed by the Minister for depreciation, or for any expenditure of a capital nature for renewals, or for the development of a business, and the Minister, when determining the income derived from mining and from oil and gas wells, shall make an allowance for the exhaustion of the mines and wells;\n* * *\nNow it is clear that one-tenth of the petroleum, gas and natural oil produced from the lands sold is not profit in the hands of the company, which is at the expense of producing it and is bound to give it to the appellant, and, so far as we know, the company did not otherwise make any profit or gain. Also, as the appellant has no reversion, and receives one-tenth of the specified minerals as part of the consideration of the sale of the inheritance, it is most unlikely that Parliament intended to include the appellant\u2019s tenth as income, within the meaning of paragraph (a) of section 3, above quoted. Why should a vendor have an allowance for the exhaustion of that which he has sold and been paid for? The definition clause must be interpreted in the light of section 36 of the general Interpretation Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 1, which was in force long before the enactment of the Income War Tax Act, 1917, and it provides that\nDefinitions or rules of interpretation contained in any Act shall, unless the contrary intention appears, apply to the construction of the sections of the Act which contain those definitions or rules of interpretation, as well as to the other provisions of the Act.\nAnd thus, it follows that the word \u201cincome\u201d in the first line of section 3 (1) of the Income War Tax Act, 1917, and the same word in clause (a) of that subsection are controlled by the same statutory definition. The stipulated tenth is not rendered annually, but at least every thirty days after production, and that irrespective of whether the operation results in profit or loss. It is by the agreement, for the lack of an apt definition, termed a \u201croyalty\u201d; but, whether or not it may appropriately be named a royalty or an annuity, the statute does not, in terms, charge either royalties or annuities, as such; and here the appellant has converted the land, which is capital, into money, shares and ten per cent, of the stipulated minerals which the company may win. What the appellant will realize, under the covenant, is, of course, uncertain; although it may be ascertained in the event.\nOn the other hand, it may be assumed that if the project prove unprofitable, the minerals will not be raised and that circumstance, as well as the uncertainty of the extent of minerals available, contributes to the speculative character of the appellant\u2019s interest; but, nevertheless, the appellant\u2019s receipts come from a potential source of capital. The taxable commodity is \u201cincome,\u201d which means, by the definition, annual profit or gain; and for the appellant, there is no question of profit or gain, unless it be as to whether she has made an advantageous sale of her property. In Jones v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue[5], a case upon which the Crown relies, the appellant sold his interest in certain patents for a sum in money and percentage, called a royalty, payable for ten years, upon the sale of all machines constructed under the patent; and it was held that the sums received by the appellant in respect of the royalty were income and properly so computed for the purpose of the supertax. Rowlatt J., who pronounced the judgment, said at pp. 714-715, as to the contention that the ten per cent, upon sales was part of the consideration for the transfer:\nThere is no law of nature or any invariable principle that because it can be said that a certain payment is consideration for the transfer of property it must be looked upon as price in the character of principal. In each case regard must be had to what the sum is. A man may sell his property for a sum which is to be paid in instalments, and when that is the case the payments to him are not income. Foley v. Fletcher[6]. Or a man may sell his property for an annuity. In that case the Income Tax Act applies. Again, a man may sell his property for what looks like an annuity, but which can be seen to be not a transmutation of a principal sum into an annuity but is in fact a principal sum payment of which is being spread over a period and is being paid with interest calculated in a way familiar to actuaries\u2014in such a case income tax is not payable on what is really capital: Secretary of State for India v. Scoble[7]. On the other hand, a man may sell his property nakedly for a share of the profits of the business. In that case the share of the profits of the business would be the price, but it would bear the character of income in the vendor\u2019s hands. Chadwick v. Pearl Life Assurance Co.[8] was a case of that kind. In such a case the man bargains to have, not a capital sum but an income secured to him, namely, an income corresponding to the rent which he had before. I think therefore that what I have to do is to see what the sum payable in this case really is. The ascertainment of an antecedent debt is not the only thing that governs, although in many cases it is a very valuable guide. In this case there is no difficulty in seeing what was intended. The property was sold for a certain sum, and in addition the vendor took an annual sum which was dependent upon the volume of business done; that is to say, he took something which rose or fell with the chances of the business. When a man does that he takes an income; it is in the nature of income, and on that ground I decide this case.\nThese observations of the learned judge have their application to the statutes which were under consideration in that case; but the question here is, does a man take an income within the meaning of the Canadian Act when he sells his land in consideration of a part of the oil and gas to be extracted from it by the purchaser, if, as is stated in the present admissions, \u201cthe appellant was not and is not a dealer in or in the business of buying and selling oil lands or leases\u201d; and, when there is no provision for taxing the property delivered by the purchaser to the appellant, either as annuity or royalty; neither of these words having been used in the statute to describe any right such as that which the vendor acquired under the agreement.\nIt is the duty of the court to ascertain the real nature of the transaction. It was argued for the respondent that the appellant sold her land and joined with the purchaser in the business of recovering the minerals, but she clearly was not engaged in the business; that suggestion is excluded by the facts and admissions.\nThe case is not without its difficulties, but I am not satisfied that the Crown has made out its claim. And, \u201cinasmuch as it is the duty of those who assert and not of those who deny, to establish the proposition sought to be established, I think the Crown must fail.\u201d Secretary of State in Council of India v.

It was in evidence that, at the place of the accident, there was a line of trees which overhung the sidewalk. The jury found negligence by defendant, causing the injury, which negligence they stated thus: \u201cWe consider the wire was defective, wires running close to trees should have more thorough inspection.\u201d\nHeld (1) The evidence of the wire being on the sidewalk was sufficient to attribute negligence to defendant, in the absence of any other apparent cause or explanation excluding negligence to the satisfaction of the jury (Scott v. London & St. Katherine Docks Co., 3 H. & C. 596, at 601, cited). Plaintiffs thus adduced reasonable evidence upon which the jury might find a verdict.\n(2) When plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, being asked at the opening of the trial (in accordance with a previous application for particulars which had stood over) to specify the negligence upon which he relied, specified, as his main ground, the leaving of a live wire lying on the highway, he was not bound to explain or particularize the facts or negligence which caused or contributed to that, since these were more in the knowledge of defendant; and the case thus appeared to be one in which the occurrence of such an accident in itself justified calling on defendant to prove that it happened without negligence on its part.\n(3) The jury\u2019s intention was obviously to find defendant\u2019s negligence in the defective location of the wire and the inadequacy of the inspection, which permitted the danger incident to contact with the tree branch to remain undiscovered, until advertised by the accident itself.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Ont. (66 Ont. L.R. 409), sustaining judgment of Kelly J. (ibid) for damages to plaintiffs (on the jury\u2019s findings), affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] dismissing its appeal from the judgment of Kelly J.[2], entered upon the verdict of a jury in favour of the plaintiffs for damages. The action was for damages for injuries suffered by the infant plaintiff when, as. alleged, he slipped on a sidewalk and fell on a live wire of the defendant company which had broken loose, and which injuries the plaintiffs alleged were caused by defendant\u2019s negligence.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nGeo. F. Henderson K.C. and D.K. MacTavish for the appellant.\nJ. Wilfrid Gauvreau and J. Burrows for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014The infant plaintiff sustained serious injury, on 4th August, 1928, by falling on an electric wire of the defendant company which had broken loose during a thunder storm on Carling Avenue, opposite the Lady Grey Hospital, in the city of Ottawa.\nThe accident took place late in the afternoon. The boy, who was at the time eight years of age, was walking on the sidewalk with his brother, who was two years older, and another boy, and, when he fell, came in contact with a live wire belonging to the defendant\u2019s system, the loose end of which was at the time lying on the sidewalk. He lost part of his right hand, including four fingers, and he seeks to recover damages from the defendant for negligently causing the accident.\nThe case was tried by Kelly J., of the Supreme Court of Ontario, with a jury; and, at the conclusion of the learned judge\u2019s charge, he submitted questions to the jury, which, with their answers, are as follows:\n1. Was there any negligence by the defendant (that is the Ottawa Electric Company) which caused injury to the plaintiff Leo Crepin?\u2014A. Yes.\n2. If there was such negligence by the defendants state fully and clearly what was or were the act or acts or omission or omissions which constituted such negligence?\u2014A. We consider the wire was defective, wires running close to trees should have more thorough inspection.\n3. Was there any negligence of the plaintiff Leo Crepin which caused or contributed to his injury?\u2014A. No.\n4. If there was such negligence by the said Leo Crepin, state clearly and fully what was or were his act or acts or omission or omissions which constituted such negligence on his part?\u2014A. None.\n5. At what amount do you assess the damages of Leo Crepin?\u2014A. $10,000.\n6. At what amount do you assess the damages of the plaintiff Augustin Crepin?\u2014A. $100.\n7. If you find there was negligence by the defendant and also negligence by the plaintiff Leo Crepin, then state the degree in which each of them was in fault and the manner in which the amount of damages found should be apportioned?\u2014A. No answer because none necessary.\nThere had been a motion for nonsuit, and the learned judge heard argument upon that after the jury was discharged. He reserved his judgment, but subsequently announced his conclusion that there was evidence from which the jury could reasonably attribute the accident to negli- gence of the defendant company; and so he directed judgment to be entered for the plaintiffs for the damages as found[3].\nThe defendant appealed, and the appeal was dismissed by the Second Appellate Division[4]. The appellant now appeals to this Court, alleging that none of the specific acts of negligence upon which the plaintiffs relied was proved; that there was no evidence upon which the jury could reasonably have found as it did; that the trial judge should have refused to enter judgment upon the findings; that the plaintiffs, having alleged specific acts of negligence, could not rely upon the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, and that the learned Judges of Appeal erred in holding that there was a burden of proof upon the appellant. At the hearing the appellant\u2019s counsel emphasized two points. First, he urged that, in view of what took place at the trial, the appellant was limited to alleged acts of negligence which did not include those subsequently found by the jury. It appears that there had been an application for particulars, which had stood over to be disposed of at the trial; and, accordingly, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel was at the beginning of the trial asked to specify the negligence upon which he relied. The following is a narrative extracted from the record of what then took place:\nHis LORDSHIP: It may be difficult to put the case before the jury unless we know what you say the negligence is that you allege.\nMr. BURROWS: The first ground is in leaving a live wire lying on the highway.\nHis LORDSHIP: State all the acts of negligence upon which you are going to adduce evidence, because I do not want the jury wandering around finding negligence if it is not pleaded.\nMr. BURROWS: Suppose I prove by the evidence I intend to adduce that this wire was on the highway, is your Lordship going to make a ruling now as to whether the maxim (res ipsa loquitur) applies or not?\nHis LORDSHIP: No; I am giving you an opportunity to state what you allege were the acts of negligence on the part of the defendant on which evidence is now to be given.\nMr. BURROWS: If the maxim applies I am not bound to produce any specific acts.\nHis LORDSHIP: I am not going to shut you out from applying the maxim, but now that you have pleaded negligence if you have in mind the acts of negligence you are relying upon I think we should know what they are.\nMr. BURROWS: And I will not be debarred from applying the maxim? Mr. HENDERSON: I submit that having pleaded negligence the maxim cannot apply.\nHis LORDSHIP: That is a matter of law.\nMr. BURROWS: My evidence will be as follows:\nThat a live wire belonging to the defendant company had fallen on the highway about 6.20 p.m.\nThat the defendant company were notified immediately that a live wire was lying exposed on the highway.\nThat the infant plaintiff was proceeding along Carling Avenue about 7 o\u2019clock the same evening and fell on this live wire and sustained these injuries.\nOne act of negligence we complain of is the unreasonable length of time this wire was allowed to remain on the highway and their unjustifiable delay in failing to despatch a repair car or someone to guard the live wire so as to obviate the possibility of accident or injury to travellers on the highway.\nThen I submit that it is an act of negligence on the part of the defendant company to allow a live wire to lie exposed on the highway.\nMr. HENDERSON: That is quite satisfactory. I now understand my learned friend\u2019s position.\nIn the case of Scott v. London and St. Katherine Docks Co., in the Exchequer Chamber[5], it was said that\nThere must be reasonable evidence of negligence, but where the thing is shewn to be under the management of the defendant or his servants, and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendant, that the accident arose from want of care.\nAnd I think it is clear enough that, in this case, where a dangerous electric wire which should have remained affixed to the poles above the sidewalk, where it belonged, is found upon the public footway, the evidence of that condition is sufficient to attribute negligence to the appellant company, which was responsible for and had the wire in charge, in the absence of any other apparent cause or explanation excluding negligence to the satisfaction of the jury. In my view the plaintiffs thus adduced reasonable evidence upon which the jury might find a verdict.\nI may add that when the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel specified, as his main ground, the leaving of a live wire lying on the highway, he was not bound to explain or particularize the facts or negligence which caused or contributed to that, since these were more in the knowledge of the defendant company; and the case would thus appear to be one in which the occurrence of such an accident in itself afforded justification to call upon the defence to prove that it happened without negligence on the defendant\u2019s part. Then, secondly, it is said, and it appeared that this was the point upon which the appellant principally relied, that there is no evidence of the negligence found by the second answer, in which the jury says that\nWe consider the wire was defective; wires running close to trees should have more thorough inspection.\nIt was in proof, and there was a rough sketch before the jury, put in by defendant\u2019s counsel, that the wires along Carling Avenue, at the place of the accident, passed through a line of trees which overhung the sidewalk; five of these trees are shewn upon the sketch.\nOur attention was directed to the Dominion Act, c. 111 of 1894, incorporating the defendant company. Section 9 provides that the company may construct, erect, maintain and operate wires along the sides of and across or under any public highways, streets, etc., and supply electric current thereby; and may by its servants, agents and workmen enter any street or highway in any city, town or village, for the purpose of erecting and maintaining its wires along the sides of or across or under the same; and may construct, erect and maintain such and so many poles and other works and devices as the company deems necessary for making, supporting, using, working and maintaining its wires and systems, subject to provisions which include in juxtaposition,\n(e) The Company shall be responsible for all damage which their agents, servants or workmen cause to individuals or property in constructing, carrying out or maintaining any of the said works in this or the next preceding section authorized;\n(f) The Company shall not cut down or mutilate any shade, fruit or ornamental tree.\nIt was not suggested that the plaintiffs have a statutory right to recover, as for damage caused by the defendant\u2019s agents, servants or workmen in the maintenance of the line, even in the absence of any evidence of negligence on their part. Moreover, it was not shewn that, in order to rectify the location of the wire, it would be necessary to cut down any shade tree, or that a place of safety could not be found for the offending wire without mutilating the tree. In fact, the evidence rather suggests that the purpose might be effected without material injury to the tree. But in any event the defendant cannot justify damage caused by its negligence. Now let us refer to the testimony. The inferences open to the jury are not obscure.\nPeskett, one of the plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses, tells of finding the wire \u201cdetached from a pole * * * and looped over the branch of a tree and hanging straight down in to the centre of the sidewalk.\u201d\nClements, an electrician, one of the appellant\u2019s foremen, gave evidence for his side. In direct examination he answered as follows:\nQ. Was there anything wrong with the line to cause the break there that night?\u2014A. No, not so far as the line is concerned.\nQ. Could you see from the condition there what had caused it to fall?\u2014A. Yes; there was a limb which indicated a burn on it, and that limb had caused the two wires to come together and caused them to short circuit and caused it to come down.\nQ. That is not an uncommon thing in storms, is it?\u2014A. No.\nHis LORDSHIP: Q. What did you see on the limb?\u2014A. A burn into the limb.\nMr. HENDERSON: Q. TWO witnesses here have testified to hearing what sounded like an explosion. Tell His Lordship and the jury what happens when two wires are brought together by the swaying of a tree like that?\u2014A. When two wires come together that are alive it will cause a short-circuit and burn either one off or burn the two off at one time, or sometimes one at a time, and perhaps the other has a little left to hold it on to keep it up, but it is not very much good.\nThe same witness was asked\nQ. How do you know that the wire was not defective at the point where it broke?\u2014A. It did not look it.\nQ. You did not see the wire until you arrived on the scene?\u2014A. No; but if there was a wire broken from its own condition there would be only the one fall and not the occasion of the two going at the same time. It chanced that a branch had put those two wires together and caused them to burn and drop down.\nEdward Sims, foreman for the Ottawa Hydro Electric line, who arrived at the place of the accident before the appellant\u2019s employees, is asked what he found when he got there, and he answers:\nI found the wires burned out; the two west ends were hanging up in the trees and the two east ends were down on the street. * * * A matter of 6 or 8 inches of the wire would be on the sidewalk, and the other end ran along the grass.\nPeter Burke, the appellant\u2019s outside line inspector, says in cross-examination, that he heard about the wire breaking and does not know whether the wire was defective at the point of breaking or not. He says it would be natural for a wire that is defective to break during a storm. James T. Lambert, Superintendent of the appellant\u2019s lines, gives the following answers in cross-examination:\nQ. Any kind of defect?\u2014A. The word \u201cdefect\u201d covers a lot of ground.\nQ. Exactly. You were quite sure a minute ago that you would notice any defect?\u2014A. A defect in a piece of copper would break the piece of copper and it would not stay up there.\nQ. But it might be defective and break later on?\u2014A. Possibly.\nQ. It might not break immediately, and if it were defective you might not notice the defect at once,\u2014is not that correct?\u2014A. I think I would notice a defect.\nQ. Probably, if you climbed up the pole and examined the wire?\u2014A. A defect would not be very defective or it would show itself.\nQ. Would you notice a defect if you glanced up at the wires?\u2014A. I would notice if there was anything wrong.\nQ. You want us to believe that you would notice any defect in a wire by glancing up at it?\u2014A. A defect of any importance.\nQ. Would you or would you not?\u2014A. No, I would not.\nQ. You would not notice the defect?\u2014A. That word \u201cdefect\u201d is a funny kind of a way to get at it.\nHis LORDSHIP: Q. You know the different kinds of defect?\u2014A. A defect in the wire might be a little bit of the insulation scored on the top side of the wire pointing up to the sky, and I would not see that; but if there was a cut in the insulator when they were putting the wire on it would be interrupted by the defect. I would not see a little bit of insulation, but I would see a score in the copper.\n* * *\nQ. You do not know what condition the wire was in on the 4th August, 1928?\u2014A. I have every reason to believe it was all right.\nQ. But you have no knowledge personally of the condition of the wire?\u2014A. I saw it put up there.\nQ. In 1923?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And that is the reason why you think it should be in perfect condition?\u2014A. Well, it should not be defective in that space of time.\n* * *\nQ. I am asking you about the wire that fell?\u2014A. I know it was a good wire, the one wire you have reference to.\nQ. How do you know?\u2014A. Because it was put up good.\nQ. Is that your answer, because it was put up in 1923 it must be good in 1928?\u2014A. Put up with the best material we can buy.\nFurther on, at the close of his cross-examination,\nQ. And because you saw this line constructed in 1923 you are under the impression that it could not have a defective wire in 1928?\nHis LORDSHIP: YOU had better give his other reason as well.\nMr. BURROWS: IS that the reason, because you saw the line constructed in 1923 and you know that the best materials were used?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. That is why you think it should not have a defective wire in 1928?\u2014A. Yes.\nHis LORDSHIP: He also said because he had been inspecting it from time to time. Mr. BURROWS: Q. You cannot tell us the last time you inspected it?\u2014A. No; it is not my job to inspect it, but Mr. Burke does the inspecting.\nQ. You told His Lordship that you drew that conclusion from inspection. If you were driving along Carling Avenue in your motor car and looked up at the wires, would you call that \u201cinspection\u201d?\u2014A. Yes.\nThe learned trial judge, in his reasons for judgment upon the motion, directed attention to the fact that while witnesses for the defence told of the manner and extent of the inspection of the wires, and said that they were in satisfactory condition, none of them appears to have observed their condition \u201cat or for some time prior to the accident.\u201d He proceeds to say that\nThe jury were entitled to draw any reasonable inference as to the condition of the wires from such evidence as that there was an explosion due to contact of the wire with the limb of the tree, and that there was a \u201cburn\u201d on the limb at the place of contact, etc., and it might have been pertinent for them to have considered whether the presence of the \u201cburn\u201d indicated want of insulation or defective insulation of the wire, and whether if there had been more careful or more frequent inspection the defect, if it existed, might have been observed.\nHe refers to the proximity of the burned limb to the broken wire which fell to the sidewalk and concludes with the observation that in his opinion there was, in the circumstances, evidence from which the jury could reasonably have inferred that the wire was defective.\nThe appeal was heard before the five judges of the Second Divisional Court, and, with one dissenting, and one who did not state his reasons, they interpreted the finding of the jury as having regard to the situation of the wire in relation to the trees and the limb which, even in accord with the testimony of the appellant\u2019s own witnesses, was the probable cause of the trouble.\nI agree, and it is, to my mind, very obvious, that the intention of the jury was to find the defendant\u2019s negligence in the defective location of the wire and the inadequacy of the inspection, which permitted the danger incident to contact with the limb to remain undiscovered, until advertised by the accident itself.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Henderson, Herridge & Gowling.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Gauvreau, Burns & Burrows.\n[1] (1930) 66 Ont.

Code, ss. 226, 229, 986 (2), 986 (4) (as amended, 1930, c. 11, s. 27).\nAccused had on his premises an automatic vending machine in which customers placed a five cent coin, pulled a lever, and received from the machine a package of candy, with or without \u201cslugs\u201d (varying in number) which had no commercial or exchangeable value but might be used to operate the machine to shew printed legends for amusement only (no candy being emitted). The candy package emitted for the coin deposited was such as that sold over the counter for five cents, and on the sale of the candy emitted the accused made a profit.\nHeld (reversing judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba): Accused was not guilty, under the Criminal Code, of keeping a common gaming house. Cr. Code, ss. 226, 229, 986 (2), 986 (4) (as amended, 1930, c. 11, s. 27), considered. Rex v. Freedman, 39 Man. R. 407, overruled. Rex v. Wilkes, 66 Ont. L.R. 319, approved.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, affirming the conviction of the appellant by R. B. Graham, Esquire, Police Magistrate, at Winnipeg, Manitoba, \u201cfor that he the said [appellant] at the city of Winnipeg aforesaid on or about the 17th day of April, A.D. 1931, did unlawfully keep a disorderly house, to wit, a common gaming house at 605 Corydon Avenue in the City of Winnipeg, contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided.\u201d\nThe following statement of facts had been agreed on by the informant and the accused:\n\u201c1. That on the 21st day of April, A.D. 1931, an Information and Complaint was laid by the Informant before Fred E. Law, one of His Majesty\u2019s Justices of the Peace for the Province of Manitoba, charging that the said accused at the City of Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba, did on or about the 17th day of April, A.D. 1931, unlawfully keep a disorderly house, to wit, a common gaming house at 605 Corydon Avenue in the said City of Winnipeg, contrary to the provisions of the Statutes in such case made and provided.\n\u201c2. That on the 17th day of April, A.D. 1931, a search warrant was properly and legally issued by R. B. Graham, Esquire, a Police Magistrate in and for the Province of Manitoba under the powers conferred by Section 641 of the Criminal Code of Canada.\n\u201c3. That the said Warrant was duly executed on the said 17th day of April, A.D. 1931, and on the said premises of the accused was found in operation an automatic vending machine which is filed as Exhibit 1 in this case and which customers were allowed and invited to use and operate.\n\u201c4. The said machine may be operated by placing a five cent coin or a slug which is a perforated metal disc in a slot at the top of the machine and pulling down a lever attached to the side of the said machine.\n\u201c5. On pulling down the lever, three discs which can be seen through a glass covering in front, revolve and when they come to a stop, display printed legends or sentences, such printing being on various coloured squares on each of the three discs.\n\u201c6. That in every instance that a five cent piece is deposited in the slot of the machine and the lever pulled the interior mechanism of the machine is put in motion and a package of candy is emitted. The package of candy so emitted is identical with the package of candy which the accused sells over the counter for five cents. In operating the automatic vending machine either with a coin or a slug the machine may or may not emit certain metal discs or slugs varying in number from two to twenty depending upon what point the revolving wheels may come to rest, which discs or slugs remain the property of the accused. In some instances no slugs are emitted. These slugs or tokens have no commercial or exchangeable value but may be used by the customer to operate the machine and when it is so operated with a slug or token, it shows across the cylinders of the machine a printed legend more or less humorous for the amusement of the customer, but the use of the slug or token will not result in the operator receiving any candy. No candy is emitted when slugs are used.\n\u201c7. That printed in the front of the machine is a notice which reads as follows:\nCandy Vendor\nThis machine is for the sole purpose of vending candies and confections. Tokens received from this vendor are of no cash or trade value but may be used to play this vendor for the customer\u2019s amusement only. No candies or confections vended for amusement tokens.\n\u201c8. That this machine, Exhibit 1, is owned by the Accused who is the owner of the premises at 605 Corydon Avenue, in the City of Winnipeg, in Manitoba, and such premises are occupied by the Accused for the purpose of carrying on the business of a confectioner.\n\u201c9. That on the 17th day of April, A.D. 1931, an officer of the City of Winnipeg Police Force operated the said machine and deposited with each operation a five cent coin in the slot of the machine, for which he received a package of candy for every five cent piece deposited.\n\u201c10. That as a result of the said operation of the said machine the Constable received in addition six slugs which had been discharged from the said machine.\n\u201c11. That the said officer offered the said slugs to the Accused in exchange for merchandise and that the said Accused informed the officer that the said slugs had no trade or exchangeable value but that they could only be used to operate the machine.\u201d The note of the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, upholding the conviction, was as follows:\nOn the admissions filed and on the further admission that there was profit to the Accused on the sale of the candy emitted by the automatic Vending Machine, the Appeal is hereby dismissed.\nThe appellant, on application to a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada, under the provisions of s. 1025 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1927, c. 36, was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nThe sections of the Criminal Code involved were sections 226, 229, 986 (2) and 986 (4) (as amended by s. 27 of c. 11, 1930).\nThe Court of Appeal for Manitoba had previously given a decision in Rex v.

Code, s. 1023\u2014\u201cQuestion of law\u201d\u2014Trial judge\u2019s charge to jury.\nThe general appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada is confined to civil matters; to found an appeal to the Court in any criminal matter, resort must be had to some special statutory provision enacted by the Dominion Parliament. Save for the special case provided for by s. 1025, Cr. C., the only right of appeal to the Court in any criminal cause is that conferred by s. 1023, Cr. C. For an appeal to come within s. 1023, the conviction must have been affirmed by the court below and there must have been dissent by some member thereof on a question of law.\nThe present appeal was from the judgment of the Appellate Division, Ont., 40 Ont. W.N., 71,[1] affirming appellant\u2019s conviction for murder, two judges dissenting on what the order of the court declared (apparently in accordance with former subs. 5 of s. 1013, Cr. C., but which subsection had been repealed by s. 28 of c. 11, 1930) to be questions of law. In the opinion of some of the members of this Court, this Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal because, in their view, the grounds of dissent below were not on any question of law, but only on matters which it was competent for the jury to pass upon and which depended entirely upon an appreciation of the weight of evidence in regard to the points discussed. But the ground taken (unanimously) for dismissal of the appeal was that it failed on the merits, as the reasons for dissent below did not, on examination of the matters dealt with therein and of the trial judge\u2019s charge as a whole, shew justification for setting aside the conviction.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[2], dismissing the appellant\u2019s appeal against his conviction, on trial before Jeffery J. and a jury, for the murder of one Samuel Goldberg at Toronto. In the Appellate Division, Mulock, C.J.O., and Grant, J.A., dissented from the judgment of the majority of the court, and held that the summing up by the trial judge in his charge to the jury was not fair to the accused and might have caused a miscarriage of justice, and that, therefore, the conviction should be quashed and a new trial directed.\nBy the judgment now reported the appeal to this Court was dismissed.\nI.F. Hellmuth K.C. for the appellant.\nE. Bayly K.C. and W.B. Common for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014This Court was created by the Dominion Parliament in 1875 as a \u201cGeneral Court of Appeal for Canada\u201d by virtue of the power conferred by section 101 of the British North America Act. Purely statutory in its origin,\u2014although the Court is, by the Supreme Court Act, declared to be a court of law and equity, and, by section 35 of that Act, is constituted an appellate court with \u201ccivil and criminal jurisdiction within and throughout Canada\u201d\u2014by section 36, criminal causes are expressly excluded from its appellate jurisdiction. It follows that the general appellate jurisdiction of this Court is confined to civil matters and that, as provided for by section 44 of the Act, resort must be had to some special statutory provision enacted by the Dominion Parliament to found an appeal to the Court in any criminal matter. Such a provision is made by section 1023 of the Criminal Code, which reads as follows:\nAny person convicted of any indictable offence whose conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section ten hundred and thirteen may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of such conviction on any question of law on which there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal. * * *\nSave the special case provided for by section 1025 of the Code, I know of no other right of appeal in any criminal cause to this Court than that conferred by section 1023.\nTwo conditions must exist in order that an appeal may come within section 1023, viz., the conviction must have been affirmed by the court below, and there must have been dissent by some member of that court on a question of law. In the present case, the conviction was affirmed by a majority of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[3], two of its members dissenting on what the order of the court declared to be questions of law. Such a declaration was formerly necessary under section 1013 (5) (Davis v. The King[4]), and, notwithstanding the repeal of that provision in 1930 (Statutes of Canada, 1930, 20-21 Geo. V, c. 11, s. 28), is found in the order presently before the Court. Presumably, the repeal of subsection 5 escaped the notice of the Registrar and of the solicitors for the Crown and for the defendant who are responsible for the wording of the order; otherwise, it is difficult to account for the presence of the declaratory provision referred to. At all events, it is not binding upon us.\nAt the threshold of the present appeal, we are confronted with the question of the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain it, which depends upon whether or not the dissent rests upon \u201cany question of law\u201d within the meaning of section 1023 of the Criminal Code. Although notice of application for leave to appeal was given, the record before the Court contains nothing, save a passing reference to it by Hodgins J.A., to shew that such application was actually made, or as to its disposition. The appeal to the Appellate Division should probably, therefore, be regarded as having been confined to the subject matter of clause (a) of section 1013, which enables an appeal to be taken de piano \u201con any ground of appeal which involves a question of law alone.\u201d Prima facie, the words \u201cany question of law\u201d found in section 1023 of the Code should be read as referring to \u201cany ground of appeal which involves a question of law alone,\u201d as set out in clause (a) of section 1013, and should receive the same construction as that obviously applicable to that clause, i.e., the grounds of appeal to this Court must be confined to \u201cquestions of law alone,\u201d the appeal to this Court under section 1023 being likewise de piano.\nHowever that may be, some of my learned brothers are of the opinion that this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the appeal because they are unable to find any question of law whatever in the grounds of dissent stated by the Chief Justice of Ontario, in which Mr. Justice Grant agreed, their view being that all matters dealt with by the learned Chief Justice are really matters which it was competent for the jury to pass upon, and depend entirely upon an appreciation of the weight of evidence in regard to the several points discussed. Personally, I am inclined strongly to this view.\nBut it seems unnecessary to dispose of the case on this ground, having regard to our view upon the merits in respect to which we are unanimous.\nAssuming that there may be one or more points of law involved in the grounds of dissent, a careful examination of those grounds and the evidence referred to in them, and of the entire record, including the charge of the learned trial judge as a whole, has satisfied us that, while that charge may not have been ideally perfect, in that the learned judge (as was not at all improper) shewed, especially by his adverse comments on the evidence offered in support of the defence of alibi, that he had been more favourably impressed by the Crown\u2019s case than by that of the defence, the meticulous criticism made by the Chief Justice of Ontario of that charge cannot be justified. The defence of alibi was the main, if not the sole, defence raised at the trial and the evidence in support of it was fully presented to the jury, accompanied, it is true, by some comments, which may or may not have discredited that evidence. Such comments, if they had such a tendency, were quite within the competence of the trial judge and did not amount to a withdrawal of the issue as to alibi, or of any evidence in support of it from the consideration of the jury. On the contrary, they were told more than once by the learned trial judge that that issue, and the evidence offered in support of it, were matters exclusively for their consideration.\nIt is true that the learned Chief Justice concludes his judgment by stating that the charge, as a whole, was unfair to the accused, but he qualified that statement by adding, \u201cFor the reasons above mentioned.\u201d Examining these reasons one by one, we fail to find therein anything amounting to a withdrawal of any evidence from the jury, or any direction to the jury contrary to law. On the contrary, while criticising the evidence offered by the defence, at times, perhaps, somewhat severely, the learned trial judge was always careful to add to his observations of that character a clear statement that the several matters so discussed were wholly for the jury to consider, both as to the credibility of the evidence offered thereupon, and the inferences to be drawn from it.\nAs Mr. Justice Middleton said,\nHere the charge of the learned Trial Judge is saturated from beginning to end with repeated statements that the weight and effect of evidence is for the jury and for the jury alone, and that the onus is always upon the Crown and that the prisoner is always entitled to the benefit of any doubt that has been raised in their minds.\nIndeed, in connection with his comments upon the defence of alibi in particular, after devoting remarks, which cover several pages of the record, to a discussion of the evidence offered in support thereof, the learned trial judge proceeded to add that, if proved to their satisfaction, that defence would be a complete answer to the Crown\u2019s case, but he was careful to say in the very next sentence that, if any reasonable doubt remained in the minds of the jury on further consideration, the defendant was entitled to the benefit of such doubt.\nUpon the whole case, therefore, we are of the opinion that the appeal fails.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: T.

The broker, having received from another customer 1,000 shares of the same company represented by two certificates of 500 shares each, sold 1,000 shares for the account of the latter and, in making delivery, used one of the certificates belonging to him and the certificate belonging to the respondent. When the respondent demanded his certificate the broker tendered him another certificate of the same company for the same number of shares in accordance with the custom of the stock exchanges. The respondent refused to accept it and sued for conversion.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (43 B.C. Rep. 265), that the respondent was entitled to judgment; custom and usage of the stock brokerage business cannot override the obligations of an actual contract between the parties contrary to that custom and usage.\nAPPEAL, by special leave granted by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, from the judgment of that court[1] reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Ruggles C.C.J., and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nW. B. Farris K.C. for the appellant.\nGeo. F. Henderson K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014The respondent, who is a clerk residing in the city of Vancouver, brought this action against the appellant, a firm of stock brokers having its place of business in the same city. The plaint was that, on the 23rd of July, 1929, the respondent delivered certificate no. 951 for 500 shares in the capital stock of the Silver Cup (Hazelton) Mining Company, Limited (non-personal liability) for sale by the appellant at a price not less than 30 cents per share; that the appellant had sold the shares and had failed to account to the respondent therefor; that, in the alternative, the appellant had converted the shares to its own use; wherefore the respondent claimed damages for the alleged detention of his funds or for failure to carry out his instructions, an accounting and costs.\nThe facts proven were that the respondent owned 500 shares of the Silver Cup Mining Company and held the certificate for those shares. One Christie, an agent for the appellant, called on the respondent and advised him to buy some Weymarne Oil Stock. The respondent yielded to the suggestion upon the following conditions which, as we find them to be the very crux of this case, had better be stated in the precise words of the evidence:\nQ. When you gave Christie this order to buy Weymarne, how was he to handle it?\u2014A. He agreed to sell my Silver Cup stock for 30 cents or better and buy Weymarne. If this was not done he was to return the certificate to me.\nThe COURT: Q. What is that, the last?\u2014A. He was to sell my Silver Cup stock for 30 cents or better, and with the proceeds buy Weymarne. If it was not sold, he was to return my own certificate to me.\nThe COURT: That is a different thing. That is not varying it.\nMr. GROSSMAN: Yes, that simply means an option to buy the Weymarne, and unless the Silver Cup is sold he is not to buy Weymarne.\nThe COURT: You say, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, they could have bought this Weymarne and made this man pay for it?\nMr. GROSSMAN: Yes, and we say we bought it for him and notified him we bought it for him.\nMr. MACINNES: Q. Did you ever receive any notice?\u2014A. I never received any notice from Cartwright & Crickmore with regard to that stock.\nThe COURT: I will allow that question.\nMr. MACINNES: Q. If the Silver Cup stock were not sold, what was Christie to do with that certificate?\u2014A. He was to return my own certificate to me.\nQ. And what became of the buying order for Weymarne?\u2014A. It was immediately cancelled.\nit\n(i.e., the order to buy Weymarne)\nwas only given to them on the condition that when it\n(i.e., the Silver Cup stock)\nwas sold, they were to buy 100 Weymarne.\nIt is common ground that the Silver Cup shares never reached 30 cents on the market; also that the Weymarne stock was not purchased and the order for same was eventually cancelled.\nThe respondent requested the return of his certificate several times. At first, he only saw a young clerk in the office of the appellant and was told that the certificate could not be located, but that he should \"come in to-morrow.\" Later, he was informed that the Silver Cup stock was held as collateral for the Weymarne purchasing order. The respondent says, on that occasion, Christie happened to be present in the office, and, upon being told what was the matter, immediately stated that \"there was a mistake right there.\" Finally, the respondent wrote to the appellant for the return of his stock certificate. He was tendered another certificate (296) for the same number of shares. He refused it and returned it to the appellant. At the trial, when asked why he did so, he replied as follows:\nA. I wrote this letter so that Christie would produce my own certificate.\nQ. Christie had told you he was not holding it as collateral?\u2014A. Well, why didn't he give it to me back? They would not give it to me back.\nQ. That is the only explanation you can give me?\u2014A. Yes, Christie was the man I had practically all my dealings with.\nQ. And you actually did receive a certificate for 500 shares, another certificate, of course?\u2014A. I received another certificate, but not my own.\nQ. Was it identically the same as the certificate you handed in?\u2014A. No, not to me.\nQ. Why?\u2014A. Because it was not mine.\nQ. That is the only reason it was not worth that much to you, is that it?\u2014A. It was not my own certificate.\nQ. It was a certificate in blank endorsed in blank?\u2014A. Yes.\nWhat had taken place, as the respondent eventually found out, was this:\nOn July 23, 1929, the appellant had received the respondent's certificate for 500 shares of the Silver Cup Mining Company. The certificate shewed that the respondent was the registered holder of the shares and that they were\ntransferable only on the books of the company by endorsement herein and surrender of this certificate.\nAs usual, it bore on the verso, a form of transfer which the respondent had signed in blank.\nOn August 5, 1929, the appellant received from another customer 1,000 shares of Silver Cup represented by two certificates of 500 shares each. On August 14, they sold the 1,000 shares of Silver Cup for the account of the other customer; but, in making delivery of the shares in fulfilment of that sale, they used one of the certificates belonging to the other customer and the certificate belonging to the respondent.\nThat mode of dealing with the respondent's securities, the appellant did not attempt to excuse on the ground of mistake. On the contrary, they asserted their right to use the certificate as they did in the ordinary course of their business and in accordance with what they claimed to be the custom of the Exchange. We are thus brought to the discussion of the appellant's defence which, in the dispute note, was expressed in the following way:\n9. *** the defendant says that the plaintiff deposited the said shares with the defendant subject to the rules, by-laws and customs of the Vancouver Stock Exchange, and subject to the general practice, customs and usage of the stock brokerage business.\n10. It is the custom and usage recognized by the Vancouver Stock Exchange, and in general use amongst all stock brokers, that delivery of the identical certificate deposited is not required, but that a tender or delivery of a certificate covering an identical number of shares is good and sufficient tender or delivery.\nIn the appellant's factum, this defence is elaborated by a quotation from the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in Gorman v. Littlefield[2], where Mr. Justice Day, in course of delivering the opinion of the court, referred to Richardson v. Shaw[3], and speaking of the decision in that case said:\nThis court therefore had to consider the legal relation of customer and broker, in buying and holding shares of stock, and it was held that the certificates of stock were not the property itself, but merely the evidence of it, and that a certificate for the same number of shares represented precisely the same kind and value of property as another certificate for a like number of shares in the same corporation; that the return of a different certificate or the substitution of one certificate for another made no material change in the property right of the customer; that such shares were unlike distinct articles of personal property, differing in kind or value, as a horse, wagon or harness, and that stock has no earmark which distinguishes one share from another, but is like grain of a uniform quality in an elevator, one bushel being of the same kind and value as another.\nAnd the appellant's counsel strongly urged before us that the above was a correct exposition of the law upon the subject, that it governed the case, and that the respondent was bound by the customs and usage of the Vancouver Stock Exchange.\nWe think it may be stated as settled law that a man who gives authority to a stock broker to do business for him on a Stock Exchange should, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be taken to have employed the broker on the terms of the Stock Exchange. (Forget v. Baxter)[4]. But it is, after all, a question of fact whether the contract was or was not entered into with reference to the customs and usage referred to (Clarke v. Bailie)[5]. Custom and usage cannot override a special contract. In the present case, the respondent testified to the fact that there was a special contract whereby the identical certificate should be returned to him, in case the shares were not sold at the named price. The statement was made clearly and repeated several times in the course of the respondent's testimony. It remained uncontradicted. Christie, with whom the contract was made, was not offered as a witness, although it is not explained that he was not available. The stipulation may be unusual, but it is not unreasonable. The intention may have been to prevent the certificate from losing its identity by being mixed with all the other stocks in the brokers' safety deposit box, or it may have been to avoid precisely what is shown to have happened in the premises.\nRuggles C.C.J., who tried the case in the County Court of Vancouver, dismissed the action. But we do not think it should be assumed from his judgment (which he delivered without giving reasons) that he disbelieved the respondent or that he found against him on the fact whether the special stipulation was made or not. The judgment can be explained upon other grounds; and, besides, we have the statement of counsel for the appellant that the point was not argued before the trial court.\nThe point, however, was raised before the Court of Appeal, and the learned Chief Justice of that court found that\nthe arrangement between the plaintiff (respondent) and Christie was that the certificate should not be parted with unless the shares were sold at the named price but should be kept and re-dilevered to the (respondent).\nIn our opinion, on the facts proved, the correctness of that finding cannot be disputed. It being so, we see no escape from the consequence that the special arrangement must be given effect to.\nWe think the evidence sufficiently shows the existence, among brokers in Vancouver, of a general practice and of a well understood usage, such as was alleged by the appellant in their dispute note, if we add to it the proviso that the broker should always have on hand or under immediate control a sufficient number of shares to take care of his obligations towards all his clients. As a rule, the proper inference would be that transactions and dealings between broker and customer, in respect to stocks negotiated on the Vancouver Stock Exchange, are impliedly affected by the incidents of the practice and usage referred to. But there can be no recognized custom in opposition to an actual contract, and the special agreement of the parties must prevail.\nWhat we have just said is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. The Court of Appeal awarded damages and, under the particular circumstances of the case, the question whether, on account of the technical breach, any loss was inflicted upon the respondent, was one of not inconsiderable nicety. In view of the terms of the order granting special leave to appeal, there would be no object in our expressing an opinion upon that or upon any other point, except so far as we have already stated.\nThe appeal is therefore dismissed. The question of costs was already provided for in the order granting leave.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Farris, Farris, Stultz & Sloan.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C. S.

The wharfage service in question is not such a service. This would appear to be so independently of, but is put beyond doubt by, s. 358. The definition of \u201ctoll\u201d (s. 2 (32)) cannot properly be construed as declaring that any wharfage service is a railway service in the above sense.\nCASE STATED by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada, under s. 43 of the Railway Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 170, on the question set out infra.\nUnder tariffs in force for a number of years prior to 1925, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Canadian National Railways undertook to absorb, in the case of import as well as export traffic, 50% of the wharfage charge at Vancouver and Victoria, where such wharfage did not exceed 50 cents per 2,000 pounds, such absorption being borne equally between transpacific steamship lines and the railways. The absorption extended to traffic moving from points in Canada east of Edson and Canmore, Alberta, and Kootenay Landing, British Columbia. In 1925 the steamship companies took the position that they would no longer participate in the absorption except on business originating at points east of the Manitoba-Saskatchewan boundary. The railways then proposed to amend their tariffs so that the absorption would apply only on traffic moving from points in Canada east of the Manitoba-Saskatchewan boundary. On complaint being made to the Board by certain shippers, an order was issued suspending, pending hearing by the Board, the proposed amendments.\nAt subsequent hearings held by the Board the question of the Board\u2019s jurisdiction in respect of such wharfage charges was raised, and after hearing the matter the Board stated a case in writing for the opinion of this Court upon the question (set out below) as to the Board\u2019s jurisdiction.\nThe judgment of the Assistant Chief Commissioner delivered in the matter was the case stated by the Board, and it concluded as follows:\nIn general, it may be said that the Board has dealt with absorptions concerned with the following situations:\n(1) Where the absorption takes place as incidental to service, over the lines of the railway carrier in Canada and intermediate between the initial point and the destination point, both being located in Canada.\n(2) Permission has been given in some instances to absorb.\n(3) The question of absorption has arisen in connection with correcting unjust discrimination and undue preference.\nThe point involved in the question as to control over wharfage absorption is a new one. In summary form, the matter divides itself under the following headings:\n(1) A movement from a point in Canada to a point in a foreign country, involving, in the case of the Canadian Pacific, a movement over its rails and a further movement over its wharf to the ship; and in the case of the Canadian National, from its rails to a wharf which is not owned by it, and a movement from this to the ship.\n(2) It is contended that under Section 358, the powers of the Board in respect of water-borne transportation are limited to movements between points in Canada. In the present instance, there is a movement which has its initial point in Canada but which has its destination in a foreign country.\n(3) It is submitted that while the Board may have power to deal with absorptions which are intermediate to movements between an initial point in Canada and destination point, no such power exists where the traffic has gone beyond the end of the rails of the carrier and is being moved to a destination in a foreign country.\n(4) It is admitted that subsection 32 of the Interpretation Section of the Railway Act, includes under \u201ctoll\u201d a charge or allowance for wharfage. But it is contended that this is only a definition section, and that the scope of the Board\u2019s powers thereunder must be obtained from the section or sections dealing with the particular subject matter concerned. It is claimed that the definition concerned in the definition section, while applicable in so far as The Railway Act applies, is limited by the words, \u201cunless the context otherwise requires.\u201d And it is contended that the limitations contained in Section 358, which have already been set out, show that the context, on account of the limitation of the field within which the Board has power, precludes the possibility of subsection 32 of Section 2, in regard to wharf charges, being applicable.\nThe question which the Board, in pursuance of the powers conferred upon it by Section 43 of The Railway Act submits for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada is:\n\u201cDoes the fact that the Board\u2019s powers under Section 358 of The Railway Act are limited as set out above, preclude the application of Section 2 (32) of the Act in respect of wharfage charges on transpacific freight?\u201d\nF. P. Varcoe for the Attorney General of Canada.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\nAlistair Fraser K.C. for the Canadian National Railways.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014I have carefully examined the sections of the Act dealing with the powers of the Board, and have come to the conclusion that (excepting the powers conferred by section 358) the function of the Board as to tolls and charges is limited to regulating charges for carriage and for those other services which are incidental to carriage, as railway services, within the meaning of the Act. My conclusion would have been that, independently of section 358, the service in question is not such a service. Section 358, I think, puts the matter beyond doubt. The office of interpretative sections is well known. The definition of \u201ctoll\u201d cannot properly be construed as declaring that any wharfage service is a railway service in the above sense.\nI confess I have had some difficulty as to the form of the question. I have read it, however, as framed on the assumption that section 358 is to be read in conjunction with the other pertinent sections of the statute; reading it in that sense the answer is in the affirmative.\nQuestion answered in the affirmative.\nSolicitor for the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada: A.

Taxation Act\u2014\" Use and Occupancy Insurance\" policy\u2014Moneys paid for loss of profits not earned\u2014Taxation Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 254, s. 2.\nInsurance moneys received under a policy commonly known as \" use and occupancy insurance \" and paid by way of indemnity for profits not earned, but irretrievably lost, are not taxable income nor subject to taxation under the British Columbia Taxation Act, R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 254, s. 2.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , affirming the decision of Macdonald J.[2] and maintaining the respondent's action.\nThe respondent brought an action to recover $8,750.68 alleged to be due and payable by the appellant for taxes upon its property and income. The appellant claimed to be entitled to a substantial set off or allowance. The appellant was carrying on business as manufacturer and dealer in lumber products, at the city of Vancouver. In 1923 it insured with 17 fire insurance companies against loss and damage to its plant and property by fire, and also against loss or damage which might be sustained in the event of its plant being shut down and business suspended in consequence of fire and damage. The insurance last mentioned is commonly known as \" use and occupancy insurance.\" It was effected by the appellant under such policies to the total amount of $60,000 in respect of loss of \" net profits,\" and $84,000 in respect of \" fixed charges.\" The plant and premises of the appellant were destroyed by fire in August, 1923, and, by adjustment with the insurance companies under the last mentioned policies, the appellant was paid $43,000 for loss of \"net profits\" and $52,427.90 in respect of \"fixed charges,\" making a total, thus paid by the insurance companies to the appellant, of $95,427.90. The appellant without taking legal advice upon the question as to whether these insurance moneys were taxable or not, included, in its \" return\" for the year 1923, the sum of $41,293.20 of such moneys, and in the year 1924 the sum of $33,706.80. The appellant, without at the time questioning its liability, voluntarily paid income tax on these amounts and sought in the respondent's action an allowance or set-off in respect of such payments.\nThe definition of \" income \" in the Taxation Act, R.S. B.C., 1924, c. 254, s. 2, reads as follows:\u2014\n\" Income \" includes the gross amount earned, derived, accrued, or received from any source whatsoever, the product of capital, labour, industry, or skill; and includes all wages, salaries, emoluments, and annuities accrued due from any source whatsoever (including the salaries, indemnities, or other remunerations of members of the Senate and House of Commons of the Dominion and officers thereof, members of the Provincial Legislative Councils and Assemblies and Municipal Councils, Commissions, or Boards of Management, and of any Judge of any Dominion or Provincial Court, whether the said salaries, indemnities, or other remunerations are paid out of the revenues of His Majesty in right of the Dominion or in right of any Province thereof or by any person); and includes all income, revenue, rent, interest or profits arising, received, gained, acquired, or accrued due from bonds, notes, stocks, debentures, or shares (including the stocks, bonds, or debentures of the Dominion or of any Province of the Dominion, or of any municipality), or from real and personal property, or from money lent, deposited, or invested, or from any indebtedness secured by deed, mortgage, contract, agreement, or account, or from any venture, business, or profession of any kind whatsoever :\nJ. W. de B. Farris K.C. for the appellant.\nE. Pepler for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014We are of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nThe British Columbia Taxation Act nowhere provides for taxation of moneys paid by way of indemnity for profits not earned, but irretrievably lost.\nThe moneys in question here represent insurance placed by the appellant in order to meet the possibility of destruction by fire of its means of earning profits. That event occurred, with the result that the appellant made no profits whatever out of the property in respect to which it had placed the insurance, which could be taxed for the period in question. There are, therefore, no profits to tax and, in the absence of clear language authorizing such a course, I find nothing in the statute to warrant the taxing of money substituted for the profits by way of indemnity for their loss.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C. H. Locke.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E. Pepler.\n[1] (1930) 43 B.C. Rep. 227; [1931] 1 W.W.R. 33.\n[2] (1929) 42 B.C. Rep. 401; [1931] 1 W.W.R. 33.\n"}

The trial judge having dismissed the action, the respondent appealed from that judgment but only against the municipal corporation. The appellate court declared the by-law valid, but annulled the contracts.\nHeld that an appellate court, the same as the trial judge, cannot pronounce the nullity of a contract when all the contracting parties have not been called before the court; that in this case the contractors were not made parties in the proceedings before the appellate court; that it is now impossible to order that they should be joined in proceedings before this court or the appellate court as the decision of the trial judge has acquired the authority of res judicata as to them. Therefore, the appellate court could not validly render a judgment annulling the contracts, and the judgment appealed from must be reversed.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Lemieux C.J., and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action. The material facts of the case and the question at issue are stated in the above head note and in the judgment now reported.\nLs. St. Laurent K.C. and Oscar Boulanger K.C. for the appellant.\nNo\u00ebl Belleau K.C. and Lucien Moraud K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret, J.\u2014L\u2019appelante est une corporation municipale r\u00e9gie par le code municipal de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 est un \u00e9lecteur de cette municipalit\u00e9 et l\u2019un des contribuables appel\u00e9s \u00e0 payer le co\u00fbt des travaux dont il s\u2019agit dans cette cause.\nLe 4 mars 1929, l\u2019appelante a adopt\u00e9 un r\u00e8glement ordonnant la construction de trois ponts. L\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux fut confi\u00e9e, au moyen de trois contrats, \u00e0 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019entrepreneurs.\nPar voie d\u2019action ordinaire devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 l\u2019annulation du r\u00e8glement et des contrats, en invoquant plusieurs moyens, dont le principal \u00e9tait que l\u2019appelante, avant d\u2019octroyer les contrats, ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas conform\u00e9e aux exigences de l\u2019article 627 (a) due code municipal.\nCette action fut dirig\u00e9e contre la corporation municipale, comme d\u00e9fenderesse, et contre les entrepreneurs, comme mis en cause.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, ayant \u00e9cart\u00e9 comme mal fond\u00e9s tous les moyens soulev\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9, trouva le r\u00e8glement\nen tout conforme \u00e0 l\u2019article (a) du code municipal,\nl\u2019interpr\u00e9tation comme pourvoyant efficacement\nau pr\u00e9l\u00e8vement d\u2019une taxe sp\u00e9ciale des contribuables pour le paiement du quart du co\u00fbt de la construction des ponts,\n(la balance \u00e9tant pay\u00e9e au moyen d\u2019une subvention du gouvernement) et d\u00e9clara les contrats valides.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance ajoute d\u2019ailleurs que la presque totalit\u00e9 de la part incombant \u00e0 l\u2019appelante, dans le prix des contrats, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 acquitt\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des entrepreneurs au moyen de mat\u00e9riaux vendus \u00e0 ces derniers. Comme cons\u00e9quence, les contribuables n\u2019avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 payer qu\u2019une somme tr\u00e8s minime. Celle du demandeur s\u2019est \u00e9lev\u00e9e \u00e0 $0.80, et il para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 le seul \u00e0 ne pas avoir acquitt\u00e9 cette faible contribution.\nEn plus, lors de l\u2019audition devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, les travaux \u00e9taient termin\u00e9s, accept\u00e9s et re\u00e7us par le d\u00e9partement des travaux publics et par l\u2019appelante, sans aucune protestation de la part des contribuables, \u201cet tout le monde para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfait\u201d. Les entrepreneurs avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s et les ponts \u00e9taient ouverts \u00e0 la circulation.\nCes faits furent prouv\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate, par suite d\u2019un plaidoyer puis darrein continuans d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9. Ils sont constat\u00e9s au jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, qui conclut, apr\u00e8s avoir fait remarquer que, en vertu de l\u2019article 627 (a) C.M., l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait pu demander l\u2019\u00e9manation d\u2019un bref d\u2019injonction pour emp\u00eacher l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux:\nIl n\u2019en a rien fait; et, par son silence, il a tacitement approuv\u00e9 tout ce que le conseil a fait. La proc\u00e9dure adopt\u00e9e par lui dans la pr\u00e9sente cause est le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019une arri\u00e8re-pens\u00e9e. D\u2019ailleurs, \u00e0 l\u2019audition, il a admis que le tout se r\u00e9duisait \u00e0 une question de frais.\nLa cour rejeta l\u2019action avec d\u00e9pens.\nPar ce jugement, il fut donc d\u00e9clar\u00e9, tant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la corporation municipale qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des entrepreneurs, que le r\u00e8glement ordonnant la construction des trois ponts \u00e9tait l\u00e9gal, et que les contrats pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux \u00e9taient valides et liaient la corporation vis-\u00e0-vis des entrepreneurs.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 inscrivit sa cause en appel seulement \u00e0 rencontre de la corporation municipale.\nLa Cour du B anc du Roi d\u00e9cr\u00e9ta de nouveau que le r\u00e8glement \u00e9tait l\u00e9gal; mais la majorit\u00e9 d\u00e9cida que les contrats n\u2019\u00e9taient pas valides, parce que le r\u00e8glement ne pourvoyait pas \u00e0 l\u2019appropriation des deniers n\u00e9cessaires pour payer le co\u00fbt des travaux.\nLe r\u00e8glement, sur ce point, se lit comme suit:\nPour le pont Patoine:\nIl est aussi statu\u00e9 et ordonn\u00e9 qu\u2019une taxe sp\u00e9ciale sera pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e sur tous les biens imposables des contribuables oblig\u00e9s audit pont afin d\u2019en faire le paiement dans un seul versement au comptant.\nPour les ponts LaBrecque et Letellier:\nIl est aussi statu\u00e9 et ordonn\u00e9 qu\u2019une taxe sp\u00e9ciale sera impos\u00e9e et pr\u00e9lev\u00e9e sur tous les biens, etc.\nLa majorit\u00e9 de la cour exprima l\u2019opinion que, par cette phras\u00e9ologie (employant le temps futur au lieu du temps pr\u00e9sent), le r\u00e8glement \u201cn\u2019impose actuellement aucune taxe sp\u00e9ciale ou autre\u201d. Elle jugea donc que les contrats pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 octroy\u00e9s avant que la corporation e\u00fbt satisfait \u00e0 toutes les prescriptions de l\u2019article 627 (a) C.M., et que la demande en nullit\u00e9 devait \u00eatre accueillie quant aux trois contrats attaqu\u00e9s.\nM. le juge Bond, toutefois, trouvait que la discussion n\u2019avait plus qu\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat acad\u00e9mique, vu que les travaux \u00e9taient termin\u00e9s, que le gouvernement provincial avait vers\u00e9 sa part de l\u2019entreprise et que les entrepreneurs avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s. Il consid\u00e9rait que l\u2019omission reproch\u00e9e par la majorit\u00e9 \u00e9tait\nex post jacto immaterial * * * and no useful purpose will be served now by annulling these contracts, which have been completely executed and paid for.\nIl n\u2019e\u00fbt donc maintenu l\u2019action de l\u2019intim\u00e9 que pour les frais; et il n\u2019e\u00fbt pas annul\u00e9 les contrats.\nIl appert d\u2019ailleurs des notes de jugement d\u00e9pos\u00e9es au nom des autres juges qu\u2019ils fussent arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion que M. le juge Bond, s\u2019ils n\u2019eusent \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019avis que la preuve des faits post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 l\u2019action \u00e9tait irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas possible de la prendre en consid\u00e9ration.\nIl nous semble cependant que la pr\u00e9sence au dossier d\u2019un plaidoyer puis darrein continuons justifiait la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, et, en tenant compte de toutes les circonstances, devant l\u2019admission de l\u2019intim\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e au jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure \u201cque le tout se r\u00e9duisait \u00e0 une question de frais\u201d, nous croyons que le plus que l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait d\u00fb obtenir en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, e\u00fbt d\u00fb \u00eatre le maintien de son action pour les frais seulement. Mais, pour le motif qu\u2019il nous reste \u00e0 exposer, et sans nous prononcer sur les autres questions soulev\u00e9es, nous croyons que la Cour du Banc du Roi ne pouvait pas annuler les contrats, comme elle l\u2019a fait.\nCes contrats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9s valides par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure dans une instance entre l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019une part, et la corporation appelante ainsi que les entrepreneurs d\u2019autre part. L\u2019intim\u00e9, nous l\u2019avons vu, a inscrit en appel seulement contre la corporation. Les entrepreneurs, parties aux contrats, n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Cour du Banc du Roi. Or, la nullit\u00e9 d\u2019un contrat ne peut \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e que dans une instance o\u00f9 tous les contractants sont devant le tribunal comme parties. C\u2019est l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour du Banc du Roi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec dans la cause de Lachapelle v. Niger (1)[1] et c\u2019est le principe pos\u00e9 par la Cour Supr\u00eame dans la cause de Burland v. Moffatt[2]:\nThe nullity of a deed should not be pronounced without putting all the parties to it en cause en d\u00e9claration de jugement commun.\nEn g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, on rem\u00e9die \u00e0 une semblable situation en ordonnant la mise en cause des personnes dont la pr\u00e9sence est n\u00e9cessaire. C\u2019est ce que nous avons fait tout r\u00e9cemment encore (19 mars 1928) dans la cause de Lamarre v. Prudhomme. Ce qui est arriv\u00e9 dans cette affaire\u2014et cela est susceptible de se produire dans chaque esp\u00e8ce du m\u00eame genre\u2014est que les parties dont la mise en cause fut ainsi ordonn\u00e9e ont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 qu\u2019elles avaient droit de lier contestation par des d\u00e9fenses \u00e9crites et, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, de recommencer l\u2019instruction pour leur propre compte afin de contre-interroger les t\u00e9moins de la partie adverse et de soumettre la preuve quelles pouvaient avoir \u00e0 offrir. Cette cour a d\u00fb faire droit \u00e0 ces repr\u00e9sentations et a remis la cause devant le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance.\nDans tous les cas, avant de prononcer la nullit\u00e9 d\u2019un contrat, toutes les parties contractantes doivent \u00eatre appel\u00e9es devant le tribunal. Et ce principe s\u2019impose tout autant \u00e0 la juridiction d\u2019appel que devant le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance.\nOr, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les entrepreneurs n\u2019\u00e9taient pas devant la Cour du Banc du Roi, et il n\u2019est plus possible de les mettre en cause parce que, en ce qui les concerne, nonobstant l\u2019appel contre la corporation municipale, la premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision conserve toute sa force et a acquis pour eux l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e. (Sirey, 1907, I. 13.) Ils ne peuvent plus \u00eatre appel\u00e9s \u00e0 venir d\u00e9fendre des contrats qui, \u00e0 leur profit, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finitivement jug\u00e9s valides.\nLe r\u00e9sultat est que, dans la m\u00eame cause et \u00e0 l\u2019instance du m\u00eame demandeur, des contrats entre la corporation de St-Gervais et ses entrepreneurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9s valides quant aux entrepreneurs et invalides quant \u00e0 la corporation. Cette derni\u00e8re est li\u00e9e envers ses entrepreneurs par un jugement pass\u00e9 en force de chose jug\u00e9e et elle serait d\u00e9clar\u00e9e d\u00e9li\u00e9e par un jugement en appel o\u00f9 les entrepreneurs ne figuraient plus. R\u00e9sultat inadmissible et qui rendrait chacun des jugements impossible d\u2019ex\u00e9cution. La Cour de Cassation d\u00e9cide que l\u2019appel dirig\u00e9 contre quelques-unes seulement des parties qui ont figur\u00e9 en premi\u00e8re instance est irrecevable, lorsque la contestation ne peut \u00eatre jug\u00e9e que contradictoirement avec les parties omises (D. 1854. 3. 29; D. 72. 1. 442; D. 1906. 1. 310; S. 1909. 1. 370; D. 1922. 1. 163. D. 1924. 1. 189; 1927. 1. 248).\nUn exemple tir\u00e9 de Dalloz (R\u00e9pertoire, vbo. Appel civil, n\u00b0 611) nous para\u00eet tr\u00e8s au point. Il dit:\nQuant aux parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019appel, ce n\u2019est pas seulement une facult\u00e9, c\u2019est une obligation pour l\u2019appelant de les intimer. Ainsi, lorsqu\u2019on a actionn\u00e9 en premi\u00e8re instance le vendeur et l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur, pour faire d\u00e9clarer une vente nulle, on ne peut, sur l\u2019appel, se contenter d\u2019assigner le vendeur; il faut citer les deux parties.\nA l\u2019appui de cette proposition, il cite le jugement dans la cause de Herv\u00e9 c. Larue, o\u00f9 le passage qui a trait \u00e0 cette question se lit comme suit:\nAttendu que Herv\u00e9 n\u2019a pas relev\u00e9 appel du jugement du 19 ao\u00fbt 1811 contre Fromont, acqu\u00e9reur, mais seulement contre Larue, vendeur; et qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas possible d\u2019annuler le contrat de vente qui fait l\u2019objet du proc\u00e8s, dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du vendeur, tandis qu\u2019il subsisterait dans celui de l\u2019acqu\u00e9reur; d\u2019o\u00f9 il r\u00e9sulte que la pr\u00e9tention de Herv\u00e9 est non recevable devant la cour, attendu qu\u2019elle ne lui est soumise que par un appel relev\u00e9 contre Larue seul, et adoptant au surplus les motifs du jugement dont est appel.\nCette solution nous para\u00eet in\u00e9vitable dans la cause actuelle. L\u2019inscription en appel de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait insuffisante et inefficace pour faire prononcer la nullit\u00e9 des contrats. S\u2019il y avait eu moyen d\u2019y rem\u00e9dier, nous l\u2019aurions fait. Comme cela n\u2019est pas possible, il faut adopter la seule alternative qui reste ouverte.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 ne peut s\u2019en plaindre, parce que c\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e0 lui qu\u2019il incombait de mettre devant la Cour du Banc du Roi toutes les parties requises. Comme le disait M. le juge Taschereau, dans la cause de Burland v. Moffatt[3]:\nHe has failed voluntarily to put the court in a position to grant (his demand), and his adversary has then an acquired right to its dismissal.\nNotre devoir est de rendre le jugement que la Cour du Banc du Roi aurait d\u00fb rendre (Loi de la Cour Supr\u00eame, art. 47). La Cour du Banc du Roi ne pouvait pas annuler les contrats alors qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas toutes les parties contractantes devant elle; et, comme elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le r\u00e8glement l\u00e9gal, elle aurait d\u00fb confirmer le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. C\u2019est l\u00e0 le jugement que nous croyons devoir rendre maintenant. L\u2019appel est donc maintenu et le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure est confirm\u00e9, avec d\u00e9pens tant devant la Cour du Banc du Roi que devant cette Cour.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Boulanger, Marquis & Lessard.\nSolicitor for the respondent: L.

Geel, [1931] S.C.R. 443\nDate: 1931-06-12\nWinnipeg Electric Company (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nJacob Geel (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1931: February 10; 1931: June 12.\nPresent: Duff, Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ., and Maclean J. ad hoc.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nMotor vehicles\u2014Negligence\u2014Injury caused by motor vehicle\u2014Motor Vehicle Act, Man., C.A. 1924, \u0441. 131, s. 62\u2014Onus of proof as to negligence\u2014Operation of the statutory presumption\u2014Efficiency of brakes (s. 15)\u2014Inspection\u2014Evidence\u2014Jury\u2019s findings\u2014Particularizing of alleged negligence\u2014Pleadings\u2014Rule 334, \u0441. 46, R.S.M. 1913.\nPlaintiff, while in a motor car, was injured by defendant\u2019s motor bus striking the car, by reason, apparently, of the giving way of a small bolt or pin in the bus\u2019s braking appliances, rendering its brake ineffective. Defendant claimed that there had been proper inspection of the bus and equipment and that the collapse of the brake mechanism was owing to a latent defect in the pin not discoverable by careful inspection. The jury found negligence in defendant, causing the injury, and, asked in what particulars, as alleged by plaintiff, the negligence consisted, answered \u201cIn not keeping brakes and braking equipment in proper repair, and insufficient inspection of said brakes.\u201d Judgment at trial for damages to plaintiff was upheld by the Court of Appeal, Man., on a divided court (39 Man. R. 18). Defendant appealed.\nHeld: In view of the evidence, and the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act, Man. (C.A. 1924, c. 131), the jury\u2019s verdict should not be set aside.\nPer Duff and Lamont JJ.: S. 62 of said Act created against defendant a rebuttable presumption of negligence. Under its operation, the onus of disproving negligence remains throughout. If the evidence, when concluded, is too meagre or too evenly balanced to enable the tribunal to determine this issue, as a question of fact, then, by force of the statute, the plaintiff is entitled to succeed. This does not mean that defendant must \u201cdemonstrate its case\u201d; it must give reasonable evidence in rebuttal of the legal presumption against it, and the evidence must be such as to satisfy the judicial conscience of the tribunal of fact. Nor does it mean that necessarily, in all cases, defendant must shew precisely how, through the agency of its vehicle, the injury was brought about (the onus in this aspect discussed). As to the form of the verdict in the present case, the jury\u2019s answer to the first question (as to negligence in defendant, causing the injury) was really conclusive; its answer to the second question (as to particulars) could only be regarded as material if it tended (as, held, it did not) to shew that, in answering the first question, it had been misled into error. It was not necessary to require the jury to specify defendant\u2019s negligence, nor for plaintiff to have given particulars of negligence and established it as particularized. In fact, it is not incumbent on plaintiff, proceeding under the statute, to charge negligence in terms; for the law presumes negligence in his favour, and it is for defendant to rebut the presumption (Rule 334, c. 46, R.S.M. 1913).\nPer Rinfret, Cannon and Maclean (ad hoc) JJ.: In view of s. 15 of the Act (requiring adequate brakes, sufficient to control at all times), and of s. 62 (as to onus), and on the evidence (as to sufficiency of brakes and of inspection), the jury had warrant for its findings, which should not be disturbed.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] dismissing, in the result, on a divided court, the defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment, on trial of the action before Dysart J. and a jury, in favour of the plaintiff for $11,158.25, in an action for damages for personal injuries alleged to have been suffered by the plaintiff by reason of an automobile in which he was riding being struck, while it was standing, by a motor bus of the defendant, owing, as alleged, to defendant\u2019s negligence. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported. Th\u00e8 appeal was dismissed with costs.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the appellant.\nE. F. Newcombe K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff and Lamont JJ. was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The facts are outlined in the judgment of Mr. Justice Robson[2] in these passages:\nOn the evening of Sunday, 22nd April, 1928, at about nine o\u2019clock, the plaintiff had come from the Capitol Theatre and entered the Reo automobile of a friend, one Galsbeck, evidently to go home. The plaintiff was in the back seat. The Reo automobile proceeded a short space westerly towards the Donald Street intersection and stopped in a group of cars against which at the moment the signal was directed. While thus at rest, the Reo was struck from behind with considerable force by a motor bus of the defendants and plaintiff suffered injuries.\n* * *\nThe plaintiff called as witnesses certain occupants of the Galsbeck car and bystanders and medical men. The plaintiff also introduced as evidence part of the examination on discovery of Erhardt, the driver of the defendants\u2019 motor bus. This latter was the only testimony dealing with the bus mechanism adduced by plaintiff. The other witnesses on that phase were called by defendants and were Erhardt, Holmes, a bus and brake superintendent, Colyer, a mechanic, and Johnston, also a mechanic.\nIn the portion of the Erhardt examination introduced by plaintiff, Erhardt said the bus was of the \u201cWhite\u201d make and was about four or five years old; that defendant had had it since late in 1925; that they bought it from a private individual in Winnipeg and used it about half time; that at the time of the accident he (Erhardt) was on his regular route between Winnipeg and Transcona and was just on his way from. Transcona to the Winnipeg Terminal on Hargrave street; that the bus a twenty-five passenger one, but that he had only one passenger at the time. The bus was gas propelled, and weighed, Erhardt thought, between five and six tons. He said he had been proceeding along Portage Avenue at about twelve or fifteen miles an hour; that that was his usual speed and he couldn\u2019t go any faster in that traffic; that he was about to stop for the intersection when something gave way and the brake was then ineffective, hence the collision. This was attributed to the giving way of a small bolt or pin in the braking appliances, but whether it was the breaking of the bolt or its loss from its position, is not clear.\nThe defence of the appellants in substance was, that the equipment of the motor bus was adequate, and that the collapse of the brake mechanism by reason of which the driver lost control of the vehicle, was due to the fracture of a brake pin, owing to a latent defect in the pin, not discoverable by careful inspection; and, that the bus and its equipment had been subjected to a proper inspection, which had revealed nothing pointing to any deficiency in the machinery. The trial judge directed the jury thus:\nSo I repeat, this action is based upon negligence. One thing is clear; there was no negligence on the part of the plaintiff himself. There was nothing that he did that was in violation of any duty towards the defendant, and there was nothing that he ought to have done in the circumstances. That narrows the field of inquiry down to the question, which I have already mentioned, \u201cWas there any breach of duty on the part of the defendant which caused the injury to the plaintiff?\u201d\nWe have in this province for our guidance a Motor Vehicle Act, section 63 [62] of which states: \u201cWhen any loss, damage or injury is caused to any person by a motor vehicle, the onus of proof that such loss, damage or injury did not arise through, the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver of the motor vehicle * * * shall be upon the owner or driver of the motor vehicle.\u201d In other words, by reason of that enactment the onus is now upon the defendant to show that it was not negligent, whereas normally in other cases it would be upon the plaintiff to show that the defendant was negligent. The result of that is that if the evidence is evenly balanced both ways the defendant has not shown that there was no negligence, and having failed in that, it could be held liable for negligence or a breach of duty, because the duty on the defendant is to free itself from the imputation of negligence. In doing that, the defendant has not to carry it to any unreasonable extremes; it is just a mere preponderance in the balancing of the evidence. If the weight is with the defendant, it should have the benefit.\nThe verdict of the jury was given in answer to specific questions, which, with the answers, were these:\u2014\n(1) Was there any negligence on the part of the defendant which caused the injury to the plaintiff?\u2014A. Yes.\n(2) If you find there was such negligence, in what particulars as alleged in the statement of claim did that negligence consist? Answer: Paragraph (\u0192), In not keeping brakes and braking equipment in proper repair, and insufficient inspection of said brakes.\n(3) If you find such negligence, at what do you assess the damages of the plaintiff?\u2014A. Ten thousand dollars ($10,000) plus expenses as agreed to by counsel.\nI have no doubt that the learned trial judge was right, in directing the jury as he did, that, by force of the statute cited, the plaintiff, having proved that he had suffered injuries caused by a motor vehicle owned by the appellants and driven by their servant, was entitled to recover reparation from the appellants unless they established that these injuries \u201cdid not arise through the negligence or improper conduct\u201d of the appellants or their driver. The statute creates, as against the owners and drivers of motor vehicles, in the conditions therein laid down, a rebuttable presumption of negligence. The onus of disproving negligence remains throughout the proceedings. If, at the conclusion of the evidence, it is too meagre or too evenly balanced to enable the tribunal to determine this issue, as a question of fact, then, by force of the statute, the plaintiff is entitled to succeed.\nThis does not mean, of course, that the defendants \u201cmust demonstrate their case.\u201d They must given reasonable evidence in rebuttal of the legal presumption against them, and the evidence must be such as to satisfy the judicial conscience of the tribunal of fact. Nor does it mean that it is necessarily, in all cases, incumbent upon the owner or driver, against whom the statute is invoked, to adduce evidence, shewing precisely how, through the agency of the motor bus, \u201cthe loss, damage or injury\u201d was brought about; the circumstances may be such that the proper course, or, indeed, the only course open to the defendants, is to prove affirmatively that the duty cast upon them by law to exercise proper care in order to avoid such \u201closs, damage or injury\u201d was duly discharged. The sufficiency of the explanations advanced will be considered by the tribunal in light of the opportunities of knowledge possessed by the parties respectively, and due consideration will be given to care or absence of care in respect of the preservation and production of available material evidence.\nI do not enter upon a discussion of facts. Sufficient is said in the judgment of Mr. Justice Robson, to shew that, on the evidence, a finding by the jury that the appellants had not acquitted themselves of the onus cast upon them, could not, as the law governing such matters stands, be set aside by an appellate court as a perverse or unreasonable verdict.\nAs to the form of the verdict, the finding of the jury in answer to the first question is really conclusive. The answer to the second question could only be regarded as material, if it tended to shew that, in answering the first question, the jury had been misled into error. For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Robson, that is, I think, a proposition which cannot be maintained. But I think it should be noticed, perhaps, that the learned trial judge, while his charge to the jury left nothing to be desired in point of fairness, went beyond what was demanded of him in requiring the jury to specify the negligence of the appellants. In saying this, it must be added, that counsel for the plaintiff, as well as counsel for the defendants, proceeded from the beginning of the action, in their pleadings and down to the end of the trial, upon the assumption that, notwithstanding the statute, it was the duty of the respondent to give particulars of negligence, and to establish the existence of negligence as particularized. In truth, it is not incumbent upon the plaintiff, proceeding under the statute, to charge negligence in terms; for the reason that the law presumes negligence in his favour, and the burden of rebutting the presumption lies upon the defendant. Marginal Rule, 334, ch. 46. R.S.M. 1913, reads thus:\nNeither party need in any pleading allege any matter of fact which the law presumes in its favour, or as to which the burden of proof lies upon the other side, unless the same has first been specifically denied.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. The judgment of Rinfret, Cannon and Maclean (ad hoc), JJ., was delivered by\nCannon J.\u2014The respondent sued the appellant company to recover damages for injuries suffered by him, on or about the 22nd day of April, 1928, by reason of a collision between a bus operated by the appellant and an automobile in which the respondent was driving. The version of the accident, as given by the driver of the bus, was adopted by both parties as follows:\nQ. Well then, the cause of the accident was the trouble with the brake?\u2014A. The little bolt, it is in the brake evener on the brake rods, I call it the brake mechanism; I don\u2019t know whether it was in the brake evener or the rod itself; it broke as I applied the brakes, letting my brake pedal go right through the floor board with no pressure on the brake.\nQ. This is the mechanism that is connected with the pedal?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Didn\u2019t you have an emergency brake on?\u2014A. The emergency and the pedal brake of that car are on the one brake evener.\nQ. Did you try to use the emergency?\u2014A. I did put it on; as soon as I hit for the curb I put the emergency on.\nQ. And that didn\u2019t hold up?\u2014A. It held it up but not enough to stop me in time.\nThe respondent\u2019s solicitor, before the case went to the jury, insisted that the jury should be left free to return a general verdict, because, in this case, the onus being on the defendant to clear itself entirely, if the latter did not do so, the jury might find in a general way that the appellant was guilty of negligence. The judge, however, asked the jury to answer certain questions, to which they did as follows:\n1. Was there any negligence on the .part of the defendant which caused the injury to the plaintiff?\u2014A. Yes.\n2. If you find there was such negligence, in what particulars as alleged in the statement of claim did that negligence consist?\u2014A. Paragraph (\u0192), In not keeping brakes and braking equipment in proper repair and insufficient inspection of said brakes.\nThereupon judgment was entered for the respondent for $11,158.25 and costs.\nThe defendant appealed from this judgment and verdict to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, which dismissed the appeal without costs, dismissal of the appeal being favoured by Prendergast C.J.M. and Robson J.A., while Fullerton and Dennistoun JJ.A., would have allowed the appeal; Trueman J.A., held that the verdict and judgment could not be upheld, and favoured a new trial[3]. The appellant alleges the following reasons to support the appeal:\n1. There was no negligence on the part of the defendant, and the verdict and judgment are not supported by the evidence.\n2. The learned trial judge failed to properly or sufficiently direct the jury as to the duty of the defendant to keep brakes and braking equipment in repair and proper condition, and as to inspection thereof, and should have told the jury the defendant was under no higher duty to the plaintiff than the ordinary careful motor car owner or driver.\n3. The learned trial judge should have instructed the jury that, inasmuch as the evidence submitted established the cause of the accident, the question of onus as a determining factor of the liability did not arise.\n4. The Court of Appeal having differed in opinion, the majority in favour of the appellant should have allowed the appeal and set aside the verdict and judgment, failing which a new trial of the action should have been ordered.\n5. The damages awarded by the jury were excessive.\nThe learned counsel for the appellant gave up the branch of the appeal concerning the quantum of damages, and very ably gave reasons why the verdict of the jury should be set aside as contrary to the evidence.\nHe also acknowledged the onus imposed upon the appellant by the Motor Vehicle Act at the time in force in Manitoba, cap. .131, 1924 Consolidated Amendments, section 62, which provides:\n62. When any loss, damage or injury is caused to any person by a motor vehicle the onus of proof that such loss, damage or injury did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct of the owner or driver of the motor vehicle, and that the same had not been operated at a rate of speed greater than was reasonable and proper having regard to the traffic and use of the highway or place where the accident happened, or so as to endanger or be likely to endanger the life or limb of any person or the safety of any property, shall be upon the owner or driver of the motor vehicle.\nSection 15 of the same Act says:\nEvery motor vehicle shall be equipped with adequate brakes sufficient to control such motor vehicle at all times, and with a windshield wiper, and also with suitable bell, gong, horn or other device which shall be sounded whenever it shall be reasonably necessary to notify pedestrians or others of the approach of any such vehicle.\nAccording to the evidence of the appellant\u2019s own witnesses, the bus in question was not provided with independent service and emergency brakes; but both the emergency and the pedal brakes of that car were dependent on one simple brake evener, which was found to be out of commission when a certain bolt broke or left its place. The appellant, in its attempt to exculpate itself, proved that the car had been inspected on the 5th of March, 1928, by one Albert Colyer. It appears that, on the above date, a \u201clight\u201d inspection took place when all clevises and pins in the brakes and brade rods were supposed to be overhauled. The pin in question, according to the appellant, was in a place where it would not wear at all, and this witness Colyer, who is supposed to have made the inspection, says:\nQ. How do you examine a pin?\u2014A. You can tell if there is any lost motion, whether it is worn at all.\nQ. And that is what you do?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You just attempt to see if there was any wear in it?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. If it is a pin that can\u2019t wear at all, what do you do? Some pins are in places where they won\u2019t wear at all?\u2014A. Well, we do not bother about them. If there is any lost motion anywhere we generally check it up and see where it is.\nQ. But if it is a pin that won\u2019t wear you don\u2019t do anything with it?\u2014\nA. We just see it is all right, and has got a cotter pin in it.\nThe accident took place on the 22nd April, 1928, and the car had not been inspected at that time since the 5th March. It was also proven by the appellant that the car should be inspected after running 750 miles. Holmes, appellant\u2019s superintendent of bus and brake equipment, said that this White bus was to be inspected every 750 miles and greased thoroughly by two men. He says, however:\nQ. How many miles did the bus operate subsequent to that inspection and before the accident?\u2014A. In the neighbourhood of 1,000 miles. I can\u2019t be positive of that. I know it did about 500 miles in the month of March, and about 500 miles in the month of April.\nQ. You have record of that?\u2014A. We have records of that, yes.\nThe jury on this evidence could reasonably reach the conclusion that, at the time of the accident, an inspection was past due; that if it had been made with thoroughness, the defect in the bolt in question might have been located and remedied. The appellant acknowledges that they had to prove to the satisfaction of the jury that they had not been negligent; or, to use the words of my brother Duff in Canadian Westinghouse Co. v. Can. Pac. Ry. Co.[4], they had to \u201cproduce evidence reasonably satisfying the tribunal of fact that all proper precautions had been taken in order to provide against risks which might reasonably be anticipated.\u201d\nThe tribunal of fact in this case, the jury, thought there was negligence on the part of the appellant, which consisted in not keeping brakes and braking equipment in proper repair, and insufficient inspection of said brakes. A company using busses of a capacity of twenty-five persons for the conveyance of the public was bound to inspect minutely the braking apparatus, especially in view of the fact that this particular White car was not provided with two independent braking systems and that both service and emergency brakes were dependent entirely for their operation on a perfect state of maintenance and repair.\nThe legislature of Manitoba has laid down an imperative rule which is in very clear terms; we do not need, in order to understand them, to have recourse to the interpretation given by English or other tribunals to regulations which are not perhaps couched in the same terms. The courts\u2019 discretion was restricted by the legislature when it imposed the duty on the driver of having brakes sufficient \u201cat all times\u201d to control these dangerous machines. It was the duty of the defendant to equip all its motor vehicles with adequate brake service to control such vehicles at all times. In order to be sure that the brakes were efficient and sufficient at all times, it may be necessary to inspect them daily or even several times a day. The only evidence brought forward by the appellant was that they had done a \u201clight\u201d inspection of the car several weeks before the accident. The jury found this defence insufficient and took the trouble to say so in answering the question which requested particulars of negligence. Although insufficient inspection did not appear in the particulars given by respondent, the learned counsel for the appellant very fairly stated that appellant would not quibble on this point, as inspection was discussed by the judge and was before the jury. The latter, in finding that the brakes and braking equipment were not kept in proper repair, added, as a necessary consequence, that the inspection of the brakes had been insufficient, in view of the statutory obligation to keep the braking apparatus sufficient, i.e., efficient at all times to control appellant\u2019s motor bus.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Guy, Chappell & Turner.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Chapman, Thornton & Chapman.\n[1] 39 Man.

C.C.P.\nThe Attorney-General for Quebec instituted proceedings under articles-978 and following C.C.P., invoking irregularities and illegalities in the management of the appellant company, incorporated under the Companies Act of the Dominion, also alleging violations of the law or of the Acts by which the appellant was governed with the object of defrauding the public and of endangering the public welfare and further asserting that the proceedings were taken to abate these alleged violations and were instituted and carried out in the general public interest of the people of the province of Quebec in particular. Consequently, the Attorney-General for Quebec asked that the letters patent of the appellant company be forfeited and that the company itself be dissolved. The appellant, by way of an exception to the form, moved for the dismissal of the action on the ground, inter alia, that the Attorney-General of Quebec had neither the quality nor the capacity to institute these proceedings against a company holding its powers from the federal authority.\nHeld that the Attorney-General for Quebec was qualified to institute the proceedings and that the exception to the form has been rightly dismissed by the court appealed from. The Crown, as parens patriae, represents the interests of His Majesty's subjects, and the Attorney-General for a province, acting as the officer of the Crown, is. empowered to go before the courts to prevent the violation of the rights of the public of that province, even if the perpetrator of the deeds complained of be a creature of the federal authority. In other words, the Attorney-General of a province has not only the right, but the duty, to suppress the civil offences committed within the limits Of the province.\u2014No opinion is expressed as to the question whether the courts may, at the instance of the Attorney-General of a province, direct the dissolution or winding up of a company incorporated. by Act of the Parliament of Canada or by letters patent issued under its authority. Such a question can arise only on the merits of the case and exception to the form is not the proper procedure for that purpose nor is it the appropriate way of raising it.\nHeld, also, that, by enacting art. 978 C.C.P., the legislature of Quebec intended to confer the power of prosecuting violations of the law therein stated on the Attorney-General of the province. Wherever the words \"Attorney-General\" are used without qualification in a code or in a statute of Quebec, they have reference to the Attorney-General for Quebec. But the Attorney-General for Canada may also avail himself of the benefit of the enactment provided by art. 978 C.C.P. (Dominion Salvage & Wrecking Co. v. The Attorney-General of Canada (21 Can. S.C.R. 720 ref.).\nTo the extent above indicated, the following judgments are approved: The Attorney-General v. The Niagara Falls International Bridge Company (20 Grant's Ch.

Chrysler K.C. for the Attorneys-General for Manitoba and Saskatchewan.\nJ. Sedgewick for the Attorney-General for Ontario.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014The People's Holding Company Limited is a federal company incorporated under the Companies' Act, now c. 27 of R.S.C., 1927, originally with its head office in the province of Ontario. On the record before us, it would appear that the head office was later transferred to Montreal, in the province of Quebec, but it is alleged that the proceedings adopted for that purpose were not according to law and therefore ineffectual.\nThis case originated by a petition on behalf of the Attorney-General of Quebec, in right of His Majesty the King, under articles 978 and following of the Code of Civil Procedure, alleging irregularities and illegalities in the organization, the activities and the management of the company; asserting that the company made use of its charter to defraud the public who, in the words of the petition,\na d\u00e9j\u00e0 perdu des sommes consid\u00e9rables par l'achat d'un certain nombre d'actions de la compagnie intim\u00e9e.\nand that, without the present intervention of the Attorney General,\nle public du Canada et de la province de Qu\u00e9bec en particulier est en danger de perdre des sommes tr\u00e8s consid\u00e9rables.\nUnder the circumstances, the prayer of the petition is that a writ of scire facias should issue pursuant to the articles of the code already mentioned in order that it might be declared:\n(a) Que la compagnie intim\u00e9e a commenc\u00e9 et a continu\u00e9 ses op\u00e9rations en violation de l'acte qui la r\u00e9git;\n(b)(Que la dite compagnie intim\u00e9e a assum\u00e9 et assume des pouvoirs, privil\u00e8ges, franchises, qui ne lui appartiennent pas et qu'elle est en cons\u00e9quence de venue passible de la forfaiture de ses droits.\n(c) Que les lettres patentes ou charte de l'intim\u00e9e, ainsi que tous les droits et privil\u00e8ges que les dites lettres patentes ou charte comportent, soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s forfaits; et\n(d) Que la dite compagnie intim\u00e9e ayant un capital minimum d'un million de dollars, soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e dissoute et * * * qu'un curateur soit nomm\u00e9 aux biens de la dite compagnie intim\u00e9e.\nThe appellant, by way of exception to the form, prayed for the dismissal of the action on several grounds. Some of these grounds raised questions purely of procedure. They have already been disposed of in the Quebec courts and they are not open in this appeal. Another ground was that\nproceedings. by way of scire facias are not the proceedings provided by law when seeking the remedy asked for by petitioner in the present case.\nYet another ground\u2014and the one about which we are mainly concerned\u2014was that the provincial Attorney-General had\nneither the quality nor the capacity to institute the proceedings against a company holding its powers from the federal authority.\nThe Superior Court, in Montreal, held that the Attorney-General of Quebec was the proper person to present the special information (Art. 980 C.C.P.) and dismissed the exception to the form, but without distinguishing between the various kinds of relief prayed. On appeal, the judgment was unanimously affirmed. Some of the learned judges, in their reasons, made reservations with regard to part of the conclusions of the petition, but these reservations were not expressed in the formal judgment of the court. It was feared, therefore, that the decision might be regarded as res judicata between the parties upon all of the points raised by the appellant. That involved undoubtedly questions of law of great public importance applicable to the whole Dominion, and affecting all joint stock companies incorporated by Act of the Parliament of Canada or by letters patent issued under its authority.\nFor those reasons, special leave to appeal was granted by this court so that the true effect of the judgments may be determined and that, if necessary, these important questions may be further discussed and decided.\nThe Attorney-General of Canada and the Attorneys-General of all the other provinces were notified in order that they may take part in the appeal and be given an opportunity to submit their views. Thus, for the decision presently to be stated, we had the benefit of arguments not only on behalf of the parties immediately concerned, but also on behalf of the Attorney-General of Canada and of other provincial Attorneys-General.\nFor the better understanding of the nature of the litigation, it will be convenient to give here the text of the article of the Code of Civil Procedure under which the information was presented:\n978. In all cases of general public interest, the Attorney-General must, and in all other cases, may, but need not unless sufficient security is given to indemnify the Government for the costs to be incurred, prosecute the violations of the law in the following cases:\n1. Whenever any association or number of persons acts as a corporation without being legally incorporated or recognized;\n2. Whenever any corporation, public body, or board, violates any of the provisions of the acts by which it is governed, or becomes liable to a forfeiture of its rights, or does or omits acts the doing or omission of which amounts to a surrender of its corporate rights, privileges and franchises, or exercises any power, franchise or privilege, which does not belong to it or is not conferred upon it by law.\nAt the outset, it may be stated that we do not find it necessary to decide the point whether, upon the allegations of the information and to secure the object sought for, the writ of scire facias would be a proper remedy. The appellant urged that the writ did not lie to attack, cancel and annul letters patent granted by the Crown or to dissolve a corporation created by or under an Act of parliament. Upon that contention we need not express any opinion. The information of the Attorney-General is substantially within the terms of articles 978 and following of the Code of Civil Procedure. It is expressly stated that the proceedings are taken out in compliance with those articles. It does not matter if the petition calls scire facias a writ which, in truth and strictly speaking, may not be scire facias. It is sufficient that the proceedings taken out are those authorized by the articles of the code the Attorney-General expressly appeals to. Giving the writ an erroneous or improper appellation does not alter its nature, nor does it modify the position of the parties.\nWe should therefore proceed to a consideration of the true nature of the petition and inquire whether or not the Attorney-General of Quebec has the \"capacity\" and the \"quality\" to maintain these proceedings.\nThe real question in dispute is one of quality and not of capacity. It is unquestionable that the Crown has the capacity to be a party to any suit. It exercises that capacity through its recognized officers and, in Quebec (Art. 81 C.C.P.), as well as in all other provinces, that officer is the Attorney-General (c. 16 of R.S.Q. 1927). It should be evident that the appellant does not wish to dispute that proposition and the issue he intends to raise really is: Whether, for the particular purpose, the Attorney-General of Quebec is qualified to represent the Crown.\nThat, by enacting article 978 C.C.P., the legislature of Quebec intended to confer the power referred to on the Attorney-General of Quebec does not seem to leave any room for discussion. Although the decision of the court in Dominion Salvage & Wrecking Company and The Attorney-General of Canada[2], is authority for the proposition that the Attorney-General of Canada may also avail himself of the benefit of the enactment, it may not be doubted that the words \"Attorney-General\" wherever used without qualification in a code or in a statute of Quebec have reference to the Attorney-General of the Province of Quebec (See art. 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, subs. 17 of s. 36 of R.S.Q. 1909 and subs. 14 of s. 61, c. 1 of R.S.Q. 1925). The respondent is therefore the officer of the Crown primarily designated in art. 978 and qualified to institute all proceedings originated under that article.\nBut the objection of the appellant goes deeper and it says: The People's Holding Company Limited is a federal corporation whose status cannot be impaired by provincial authority. The respondent, as an executive officer of the province, is not empowered to conduct litigation in respect of any subject within the authority or jurisdiction of the Dominion. He cannot, as such, grant a fiat for the issue of a writ to annul federal letters patent, nor can he take out such a writ himself without permission from the proper federal authority. In brief: Article 978 C.C.P., on which the respondent relies, does not apply to federal companies or, if it does apply in such cases, then the proceedings can only be brought by the Attorney-General of Canada or, in the alternative, if the article is meant to apply to federal companies and if it should be interpreted as giving the alleged power to the Attorney-General of Quebec, then it is pro tanto ultra vires.\nThere are no decisions of the higher courts precisely in point. In two instances (The Colonial Building and Investment Association v. Attorney-General of Quebec[3]; Casgrain v. Atlantic & North West Ry.[4]), similar proceedings in the name of the Attorney-General of Quebec against companies incorporated under Dominion law went to the Privy Council without there being any suggestion, either by the Board or by counsel, that the provincial Attorney-General was not the proper plaintiff.\nIn the case of the Dominion Salvage Company already referred to[5], under former articles of the code of which 978 and following are the re-enactment, the charter of a federal company\u2014being an Act of the Parliament of Canada\u2014 was declared forfeited, but at the instance of the Attorney-General of Canada. The majority of the court, for whom Taschereau J., afterwards Chief Justice, delivered the judgment, declared however that the articles in question \"apply by their very terms to all corporations whatsoever,\" and the court expressly reserved the question\nwhether, and in what cases, the Attorney-General for the province could also exercise that right.\nIt has now become our duty to decide whether the present information in the name of the provincial Attorney-General is a proper and competent exercise of the right.\nThe allegations of the petition all point to violations of the law or of the Acts by which the appellant is governed, with the object of defrauding the public and of endangering the public welfare. The prosecution tends to abate the alleged violations and is declared to be instituted and carried on in the general public interest of the people of the province of Quebec in particular.\nNow the Crown, as parens patriae, represents the interests of the whole of His Majesty's subjects, and we can discover no reason why the Attorney-General for the province, acting as the officer of the Crown, should not be empowered to go before the courts to prevent the violation of the rights of the public of that province, even if the perpetrator of the deeds complained of be a creature of the federal authority. In the words of Surveyer J., in the present case: \" le procureur-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'une province a le droit et le devoir de r\u00e9primer les d\u00e9lits civils qui se commettent dans les limites de sa province.\"\nThis accords with the position taken at bar by the Attorney-General of Canada who stated that he did \"not desire to contest the right of an attorney-general of a province to take such proceedings as may be open to him to take, according to the practice of the courts of the province, for the purpose of compelling the observance within the province of any law, federal or provincial, which may be in force therein.\" To the extent so far indicated and also to the extent to which they have so decided we think that the following judgments, referred to during the course of the argument and on which the courts below relied, should be approved; The Attorney-General v. The Niagara Falls International Bridge Company[6]; The Attorney-General v. The International Bridge Company[7]; Loranger v. Montreal Telegraph Company[8]; Turcotte v. Compagnie de chemin de fer Atlantique[9]; Casgrain v. Dominion Burglary Guarantee Company[10]; Guimond v. National Real Estate Company[11]; to which should be added the judgments now appealed from.\nWhat we have said is sufficient to conclude that, for the reasons stated, the exception to the form was rightly dismissed and that the appeal should accordingly be disallowed.\nThe confirmation of the judgments a quo does not imply that the courts may, at the instance of the Attorney-General of a province, direct the dissolution or winding-up of a company incorporated under the Canadian Companies Act. These questions will arise only on the merits. There is no decision on these points, as it is not the proper procedure on which to make an adjudication of that kind, nor is it the appropriate way of raising these questions.\nWe were told by the appellant that those were the only remedies prayed for in the information. We do not wish to be understood to mean that they are not open. We only say that if they are not, when the facts are found to have been established, some other order may be made, on the conclusions as drawn or upon proper amendments, which will have the effect of protecting the public and forcing the appellant to obey the laws to which it is subject.\nA powerful argument was addressed to us urging that, articles 978 and following of the Code of Civil Procedure being in substance a re-enactment of pre-confederation statutes (Statutes of Canada, 12 Vict., c. 41, s. 8; Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada, c. 88, s. 9) which, it is claimed, have never been repealed at least so far as concerns the province of Quebec, full effect should be given to their provisions in that province even as regards Dominion bodies or federally incorporated companies, as long as the Parliament of Canada does not intervene to introduce conflicting legislation or to appoint its own executive officers for the purpose of prosecuting matters of this nature within its constitutional authority (see Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. Attorney-General for Canada (1).\nThe point is so much involved with the question of remedies, with which, after all, article 978 C.C.P. is primarily concerned, that, as a consequence of what we have just said, we think it should properly be left for discussion on the merits.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Audette & O'Brien.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bertrand, Guerin, Goudrault & Garneau.\n[1] (1930) Q.R. 48 K.B. 133.\n[2] (1892) 21 Can.

Section 29 of by-law 432 of the city of Montreal provides that \u201cno person, corporation or firm shall do business * * * as * * * canvasser * * * without having previously obtained a licence * * *,\u201d such by-law having been passed under authority of the city\u2019s charter enacted by the provincial legislature. The appellant was brought before the Recorder\u2019s Court on a complaint that he was \u201cunlawfully doing business * * * as a canvasser * * * without having previously obtained a licence * * *.\u201d The company itself had obtained from the city authorities a licence to canvass for the sale of its goods and that licence was in full force at the time proceedings were taken against the appellant. Upon judgment having been given against him and as no right of appeal existed by statute, the appellant petitioned the Superior Court for a writ of prohibition commanding the Recorder\u2019s Court and the city to discontinue all proceedings against him in the matter, on the grounds that the appellant did not come within section 29 of the by-law as he was merely an instrument by means of which the company was carrying on business under its licence and that the by-law was, moreover, illegal and ultra vires as being indirect taxation.\nHeld that the appellant was not entitled to the issue of a writ of prohibition, inasmuch as, the action before the Recorder\u2019s Court being for the enforcement of a by-law, that court had jurisdiction under article 484 of the city charter to determine the law involved, as well as the facts, in order to decide whether or not the appellant had committed a breach of such by-law. A writ of prohibition does not lie to review an erroneous judgment of a judge of an inferior court from which no right of appeal has been given by statute. The functions of the Superior Court, on an application for such a writ under article 1003 C.C.P. are not those of a court of appeal; the Superior Court has nothing to do with the merits of the dispute between the parties but is concerned only to see that the inferior court does not transgress the limits of its jurisdiction.\nHeld, also, that the by-law and the enabling statute were not ultra vires. Section 92 (9) of the B.N.A. Act gives the provincial legislature exclusive power to make laws in relation to \u201cshop * * * and other licences in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial, local or municipal purposes,\u201d and the effect of the by-law was to provide additional revenue for the city of Montreal.\nHeld, also, per Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret and Lamont JJ., that the appellant was not doing business as canvasser within the meaning of the by-law and was under no obligation to take out a licence. Anglin C.J.C. expressed no formal opinion, although being disposed to concur with the majority of the court, if it had been proper to determine that matter.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 46 K.B. 375) aff.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, de Lorimier J.[2], and dismissing the appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of prohibition.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nL. M. Gouin K.C. for the appellant.\nG. Saint-Pierre K.C. for the respondent.\nAnglin C.J.C\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the carefully prepared opinion of my brother Lamont and I agree in his conclusion that this appeal must be dismissed on the ground that the Recorder\u2019s Court had jurisdiction to determine the law involved, as well as the facts, in order to decide whether or not the appellant had committed a breach of the by-law in question.\nAs Mr. Justice Lamont says,\nIn an action for the enforcement of a by-law (which this action clearly is) the Recorder, in my opinion, has jurisdiction\u2014in fact it is his duty\u2014to determine, not only all facts relevant to the case but also the meaning to be put on the by-law. How else can he try the action?\nIt is well settled law that a judge cannot give himself jurisdiction by wrongly finding as facts the existence of conditions essential to his jurisdiction. On the other hand, it is equally well settled that, where it is necessary for a judge to interpret a statute or by-law, in order to determine whether the facts established come within its purview, the interpretation of such statute or by-law, so far as may be necessary to his decision, is as much within his jurisdiction as is the finding of the relevant facts themselves.\nIn The Queen v. Bolton[3], it is said that\nThe test of jurisdiction under this rule is, whether or not the justices had power to enter upon the enquiry, not whether their conclusions, in the course of it, were true or false\u2014\nand this applies equally whether the conclusion be one of law or fact. As was said by Riddell J.A., in Township of Ameliasburg v. Pitcher[4],\n* * * if it be necessary to interpret a statute simply to decide the rights of the parties, prohibition will not lie, however far astray the division court judge may go.\nHere, the facts are either admitted or established beyond dispute; there is no controversy as to them. So, the only question for determination by the Recorder\u2019s Court was whether or not, upon the facts, the by-law in question, properly construed, covered the case. The determination of this question of law was as much a part of the duty of the Recorder, imposed on him by Art. 484 of the Charter of the city of Montreal, as would have been the determination of the facts themselves, if in dispute. The only matter open for consideration in such a case is whether or not the tribunal sought to be prohibited had the right to enter on the enquiry; and not at all, assuming such right, whether its conclusion was or was not correct.\nBy Art. 1003 of the Code of Civil Procedure it is provided that,\nThe writ of prohibition lies whenever a court of inferior jurisdiction exceeds its jurisdiction. This particular article dealing with the writ of prohibition is exclusive of any general supervising jurisdiction of the Superior Court to be inferred from Art, 50, C.C.P. To hold otherwise would be to violate the well-known rule of legal interpretation, Generalia specialibus non derogant. As Mr. Justice Lamont says,\nDealing with the question of prohibition, it is important to bear in mind that the functions of the Superior Court are in no sense those of a court of appeal. It has nothing to do with the merits between the parties; it is concerned only to see that the Recorder\u2019s Court does not transgress its jurisdiction.\nIf it were proper now to determine that matter, I would be disposed, as at present advised, to take the view of my brother Lamont in regard to the proper interpretation of by-law no. 432. I, however, confine my decision to the point that the defendant failed to establish want of jurisdiction in the Recorder\u2019s Court.\nOn the issues raised, as to the by-law being illegal, ultra vires and unconstitutional, I entirely agree with the views expressed by my brother Lamont.\nThe judgments of Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret and Lamont JJ. were delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (District of Montreal) reversing an order of the Superior Court by which the respondent (hereinafter called the \u201cCity\u201d) and the Recorder\u2019s Court of the city of Montreal were enjoined from continuing proceedings in that court against the appellant. By a summons issued by the City the appellant was, on February 18, 1925, brought before the Recorder\u2019s Court on a complaint that he was, on February 9, 1925,\nunlawfully doing business within the city of Montreal as a canvasser in St. Matthew street without having previously obtained a licence from the said city and without having paid the city treasurer the sum of $100, contrary to the by-law of the said city in such case made and provided.\nOn being served with the summons the appellant, by his attorneys, wrote to the clerk of the Recorder\u2019s Court and claimed that the court was without jurisdiction to determine the complaint against him as the by-law under which he was sued was illegal, ultra vires and unconstitutional. The section of the by-law (no. 432), which the appellant was charged with having violated, in part reads as follows:\u2014 Sect. 29. No person, corporation or firm shall do business within the city of Montreal, as auctioneer, pawnbroker, junk or second-hand dealer, pedler, hawker, huckster, itinerent trader, public vendor, canvasser * * * without having previously obtained a licence from the city and without having paid to the City Treasurer the following sums or those which may be fixed by the civic by-laws:\n(Canvassers) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . $100.00\nBefore the Recorder evidence was submitted by the City that on the day in question the appellant had gone from house to house soliciting orders for brushes and exhibiting samples which he carried with him, and that, when questioned, he had admitted that he did not have in his own name a licence from the city to canvass. On his part the appellant submitted evidence that he was an employee of the Fuller Brush Company, Limited, the head office of which was in Hamilton, Ontario; that the company was incorporated by Dominion letters patent and was authorized to carry on business throughout the Dominion of Canada by its\nrepresentatives, salesmen and agents going from house to house displaying samples, circulars and pictures of the goods manufactured by or being sold by the company and taking orders for such goods to be subsequently delivered;\nthat, on October 5, 1924, the company had obtained a licence to canvass in private houses in Montreal for the sale of its goods, and other articles, and that the licence was in full force and effect at the time proceedings were taken against him. He also put in evidence his contract of employment with the company which shewed that it was his contractual duty to go from one private house to another within the territory assigned to him and canvass for orders for his employer\u2019s goods; that his whole time belonged to the company; that he was entirely under its control and had contracted not to sell the merchandise of anyone else. For his services he received a salary of $12 per week and a commission of 15 per cent on the amount of his sales. On these facts it was contended on behalf of the appellant that he did not come within section 29 of the by-law above quoted, inasmuch as his company had a licence to canvass and he was merely the instrument by means of which the company was carrying on business, under its licence. The Recorder, however, found him guilty of violating the by-law and imposed on him a penalty of $40 and costs and, in default of payment, two months imprisonment, basing his judgment on the case of City of Montreal v. Leslie Davignon, decided by him some time previously.\nUpon judgment being given against him the appellant petitioned the Superior Court for a writ of prohibition commanding the Recorder\u2019s Court and the City to discontinue all proceedings against him in the matter. The Superior Court held that the City was not authorized by the by-law to require the appellant to furnish himself with a licence in his own name in addition to the licence held by him employers, and that in imposing a penalty upon the appellant for want of such licence the Recorder\u2019s Court had exceeded its jurisdiction. He therefore directed the writ of prohibition to issue.\nAgainst the granting of the writ the City appealed to the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Appeal Division). That court held that it was for the Recorder to determine whether or not the appellant was doing business as a canvasser within the meaning of the by-law and, if his decision on this point was erroneous, an erroneous decision on a matter which the Recorder was competent to try did not justify the issue of a writ of prohibition. The judgment of the Superior Court (granting prohibition) was, therefore, set aside. From the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench this appeal is brought.\nBefore dealing with the question of the Recorder\u2019s jurisdiction, I shall consider whether or not the by-law required the appellant to have a licence to canvass in his own name in view of the fact that his employers had one and he was merely canvassing for the sale of their goods.\nBy paragraph (g) of the by-law \u201ccanvasser\u201d is defined as follows:\u2014\n(g) Canvasser shall apply to every person canvassing, in private houses, for orders for the sale of goods, provisions or any other article whatsoever, but not to the head or the regular and salaried employee of a business firm who, occasionally and in the ordinary course of business, goes into a private house to take an order, at the previous request of a customer, nor to commercial travellers.\nThat what the appellant was doing brought him within this definition is not disputed, but it is pointed out that the prohibition in section 29 is not against canvassing, but against \u201cdoing business as canvasser\u201d and, it is contended, that to do business as canvasser, within the meaning of this by-law, imports doing it by the canvasser on his own account and does not include an employee who is merely carrying out his employer\u2019s instructions. Whether the employee as well as the corporation was required to have a licence is entirely a question of the legislative intention as disclosed in the by-law. This intention is to be ascertained from the language used, the nature of the by-law, and the object sought to be attained thereby. In construing the by-law the paramount duty of the judicial interpreter is to give the language thereof its plain and rational meaning and to promote its object. Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 7th ed., page 226.\nThe nature and object of the by-law are apparent. Article 364 of the City\u2019s charter, as amended by 9 Edw. VII, c. 81, art. 16, authorizes the City to impose and levy:\u2014\nA special tax not exceeding $200 on * * * hawkers, pedlers, canvassers, hucksters, second-hand dealers and on all itinerant traders doing business in the city * * *.\nArticle 365 provides that this tax may be imposed in the form of a licence and section 53 of the by-law authorizes the Recorder to impose a fine, not exceeding $40 and, in default of payment, imprisonment for two months, for the infraction of the above quoted part of section 29. The bylaw, therefore, is a taxing measure enacted for the purpose of obtaining revenue for the City. That the legislature was within its jurisdiction in authorizing the City to impose and levy the special tax referred to is, in my opinion, beyond dispute. The only questions on this branch of the case are: What does the by-law, properly interpreted, mean, and does that meaning carry it beyond the authority given to the City by the legislature?\nIt is a well settled rule of law that all charges upon the subject must be imposed by clear and unambiguous language. A subject is not to be taxed unless the taxing statute clearly imposes, upon him the obligation to pay. According to the by-law the tax is levied upon those who are doing certain classes of business within the City, and is imposed irrespective of whether the business is being done by a person, corporation or firm. The fact that it is in the form, of a licence in no way alters its character as a tax, for it is only a tax that the City, under the statute, is authorized to impose. The prohibition contained in section 29, above quoted, is against any person, corporation or firm doing business as canvasser within the City without having previously obtained a licence therefor. What did the framers of the by-law mean when they used that language? Can they reasonably be held to have meant anything other than that if any person, corporation or firm paid the tax and obtained the licence, he or it, as the case might be, would be at liberty to do business as canvasser in the City? A corporation, however, can only do business by its employees or agents, as the City, when enacting the by-law, well knew. Must we not therefore conclude that it was intended, when the by-law was enacted, that every corporation paying the tax and obtaining a licence to canvass would be entitled to canvass by its employees or agents?\nThe contention of the City is that it was authorized by the statute to define, by by-law, who would be considered a canvasser; that under the definition adopted \u201ccanvasser\u201d (with certain exceptions not material here) means \u201cevery person canvassing in private houses for the sale of goods\u201d; that the appellant was a person within the meaning of this definition, that he had canvassed in the City and, therefore, he came within the by-law.\nIn order to determine the validity of this contention it is necessary to ascertain what constitutes \u201cdoing business as canvasser\u201d when those doing it are considered as subjects of taxation. If the by-law had imposed a tax on every person, corporation or firm doing business as hardware merchant, could such provision reasonably be construed as imposing the tax on every clerk or employee of the hardware merchant engaged in selling his employer\u2019s goods? In my opinion it could not, unless language was used making it clear that every clerk or employee selling hardware under his employer\u2019s instructions would be considered to be doing business as a hardware merchant. The language of the by-law in question does not, in my opinion, indicate an intention on the part of the City that an employee soliciting orders for his employer\u2019s goods, and having no interest in the orders beyond his stipulated remuneration, is to be considered as \u201cdoing business as canvasser,\u201d rather than the person, corporation or firm whose goods he was endeavouring to sell and whose employee he is. If the City had intended the by-law to apply to the individual, whether principal or employee, soliciting in private houses, there was no necessity for mentioning corporation or firm in section 29, for it is not contended that both an employee and his employer must have a licence.\nWhat is meant by \u201cdoing business\u201d has been judicially considered in a number of cases.\nIn Williamson v. Norris[5], a clerk of the House of Commons was charged with having unlawfully sold intoxicating liquor contrary to the Licensing Act. He was employed by the Kitchen Committee of the House, and sold liquor under its direction. The Act provided that\nNo person shall sell any intoxicating liquor without being duly licensed to sell the same * * *.\nIt was held that the Act did not apply to an employee selling liquor the property of his master by his master\u2019s orders.\nIn Lewis v. Graham[6], the defendant lived at Lewis-ham but was employed as clerk by a solicitor at his office in London. An action was brought against him in the Lord Mayor\u2019s Court. That court had jurisdiction under the Act \u201cif the defendant resided or carried on business within the city.\u201d It was contended that he carried on business there. On an application to prohibit the Lord Mayor\u2019s Court from continuing proceedings against the defendant, as being without jurisdiction, it was held that the defendant did not carry on business within the city, within the meaning of the Act; that the business there carried on was the business of his employer. In his judgment Lord Coleridge, C.J., at page 782, said:\u2014\nThere are two cases in the Court of Exchequer in which the questions were as to the jurisdiction of an inferior court. It was contended in one of those cases that a clerk in the Admiralty, and in the other that a clerk in the Privy Council carried on business within the jurisdiction. In both cases the court held that the clerk did not \u201ccarry on his business\u201d for the purposes of the respective Acts within the jurisdiction, because he was a mere servant employed in a department of the state. Those cases would be directly in point except for the word \u201chis\u201d in the Acts on which they arose. But I think that word makes no difference, because the words \u201ccarry on business\u201d must mean carry on his business.\nAnd Matthew J., at page 784, said:\u2014\nThe Mayor\u2019s Court Act means \u201cprovided the defendant shall carry on \u2018his\u2019 business\u201d\u2014not the business of another. Can it be said that in serving his master in the city, a clerk carries on \u201chis\u201d business there? I think the words \u201ccarry on\u201d apply to much more than mere service. The business of the plaintiff is not even carried on in any fixed place, because it is the business of a solicitor\u2019s clerk to carry on business wherever he is instructed to do it. It appears to me that the Act does not apply under these circumstances.\nSee also Ex parte Smith[7].\nCounsel for the City referred us to certain decisions of the courts in the Western provinces as supporting his contention. These cases, on examination, afford no assistance in construing the by-law before us. They are all cases under statutory provisions dealing with hawkers and pedlers.\nIn Rex ex Rel. Kane v. Haworth[8], the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal held that the person required to be licensed by the Hawkers\u2019 and Pedlers\u2019 Act was the individual who goes from house to house soliciting orders and not the corporation which employed him. That case, in my opinion, is clearly distinguishable. The sections of the statute there applicable read as follows:\u2014\n1. In this Act the expression \u201chawker\u201d or \u201cpedler\u201d means a person who goes from house to house selling or offering for sale goods, wares or merchandise, or * * * but does not include any person selling fresh meat or nursery stock, or products of his own farm or fish of his own catching or the bona fide servant or employee of any such person having written authority to sell.\n2. No person shall engage in the business of a hawker or pedler within Saskatchewan without first obtaining a licence therefor from the Provincial Secretary and no city, town, village or rural municipality or officer thereof shall issue a licence to any hawker or pedler who does not first produce a provincial licence then in force.\n3. No hawker or pedler shall sell or offer for sale any goods, wares or merchandise of any sort or class other than those set forth in his licence.\nA perusal of these sections shews that the statute was enacted not merely with the intent of securing a revenue for the province and the municipality, but also with the intent of controlling and limiting the classes of goods which could be offered for sale from house to house. Furthermore the exclusion from the definition of the bona fide servant or employee of the persons mentioned in the last clause of section 1, when such servant or employee had written authority to sell, but leaving such servant or employee under the operation of the Act when he had not, seems to me to establish clearly, as the court held, that the Act was framed to apply to the individuals going from house to house and not to their employers. In any event in that case neither the accused nor his employer had a licence. The employer had applied to the Government for a licence and had tendered the fee but had been refused on the ground that the statute did not contemplate anyone being licensed except the individual who offered the goods for sale or solicited orders. It was quite within the competence of the legislature to require the individual canvasser to take out a licence, and to control the classes of goods he offered for sale.\nIn Rex ex Rel. Nalder v. Barlow[9], the expressions \u201chawker\u201d and \u201cpedler,\u201d as defined by the Ordinance, under which the prosecution was laid, expressly included the agent as well as the principal, and Stuart J.A., in his judgment, said:\u2014\nThe very use of the word \u201cagent\u201d shews that the reference is to the individual persons.\nIn the present case the by-law, being a taxing measure, can only be enforced against those upon whom the tax is clearly imposed. The onus was, therefore, on the City to shew that the by-law imposed it upon the appellant. \u201cDoing business,\u201d within the meaning of the by-law, imports, to my mind, something more than the acts of a mere employee carrying out, both as to time and service, his master\u2019s instructions. It implies that he is wholly or partially carrying on business on his own account as the Recorder held in City of Montreal v. Lafond. This the appellant was not doing. The tax being a tax on doing business was, in my opinion, intended to be paid by the owner of the business, whether the owner was a person, corporation or firm.\nThe appellant, therefore, was not doing business as canvasser within the meaning of the by-law and was under no obligation to take out a licence.\nAnother consideration leads me to the same conclusion. The word \u201cperson\u201d in section 29, if used alone, would, by virtue of article 17 (11) of the Civil Code, and section 2 of the by-law, include a corporation unless the context otherwise required. By placing \u201ccorporation\u201d in juxtaposition with \u201cperson\u201d in the section, the City, in my opinion clearly indicated that \u201cperson\u201d, as there used, was not intended to include a corporation. But for section 29 the Fuller Brush Company, by virtue of its corporate powers, would have had a right to canvass in private houses in Montreal. That right is interfered with only to the extent of the prohibition in the by-law, that is, it must not be exercised without first obtaining a licence.\nThe next question we have to consider is whether a writ of prohibition lies to review an erroneous judgment of the Recorder from which no right of appeal has been given by statute. Article 50 of the Code of Civil Procedure reads:\n50. Excepting the Court of King\u2019s Bench, all courts, circuit judges and magistrates, and all other persons and bodies politic and corporate, within the province, are subject to the superintending and reforming power, order and control of the Superior Court and of the judges thereof in such manner and form as by law provided.\nand article 1003 provides as follows:\u2014\n1003. The writ of prohibition lies whenever a court of inferior jurisdiction exceeds its jurisdiction.\nIn dealing with the question of prohibition it is important to bear in mind that the functions of a superior court on an application for a writ are in no sense those of a court of appeal. It has nothing to do with the merits of the dispute between the parties; it is concerned only to see that the Recorder\u2019s Court did not transgress the limits of its jurisdiction.\nArticle 484 of the City\u2019s charter deals with the jurisdiction of the Recorder\u2019s Court and, in part, reads as follows:\n484. The recorder\u2019s court has the jurisdiction of a recorder and shall hear and try summarily:\n* * *\n3. Any action for the enforcement of any by-law.\nThe principles governing the right to a writ of prohibition have been pretty well established, although in certain cases it is difficult to draw a sharp line between lack or excess of jurisdiction which gives the right, and the improper exercise of jurisdiction which gives no right. The first question which a judge has to ask himself, when he is invited to exercise a limited statutory jurisdiction, is whether the case falls within the defined ambit of the statute; if it does not, his duty is to refuse to make an order as judge; and, if he makes an order, he may be restrained by prohibition. Davey, L.J., in Farquharson v. Morgan[10].\nThe City\u2019s complaint was that the appellant had violated the by-law and it asked that it be enforced against him. The action, therefore, being for the enforcement of a bylaw, on its face falls within the jurisdiction given by article 484.\nIn The Queen v. Bolton[11], it was held, in the analogous case of a magistrate\u2019s conviction, that the test of jurisdiction is whether or not the justices had power to enter upon the inquiry, not whether their conclusions in the course of it were true or false. In his judgment Lord Denham, C.J., said:\u2014\nWhere a charge has been well laid before the magistrate, on its face bringing itself within its jurisdiction, he is bound to commence the inquiry; in so doing he undoubtedly acts within his jurisdiction and, unless during the course of the inquiry evidence is offered which raises issues which it is beyond his jurisdiction to inquire into, he has jurisdiction to complete the inquiry and make the order he thinks proper.\nMr. Gouin for the appellant in his very able argument, contended that, even although the Recorder had jurisdiction to commence the inquiry, yet the moment it was shewn that the appellant was in the exclusive employ of the Fuller Brush Company, the Recorder\u2019s jurisdiction was ousted because the by-law, on its proper construction, did not require the appellant to take out a licence and the Recorder could not be said to have jurisdiction\nwhen the facts upon which the complaint was based did not constitute an offence, or when there was no evidence whatever shewing an offence.\nIt is now well settled law that where the jurisdiction of the judge of an inferior court depends upon the construction of a statute, he cannot give himself jurisdiction by misinterpreting the statute. Elston v. Rose[12]; In re Long Point Co. v. Anderson[13].\nThe rule was succinctly stated by Riddell, J.A., in Township of Ameliasburg v. Pitcher[14], in the following language:\u2014\nI think the true rule established by In re Long Point Company v. Anderson13, and similar cases, is that if it be necessary to interpret a statute in order to find out whether the division court should decide the rights of the parties at all, then if the division court judge misinterprets the statute and so gives himself jurisdiction to decide such rights, prohibition will lie; but if it be necessary to interpret a statute simply to decide the rights of the parties, prohibition will not lie, however far astray the division court judge may go.\nIt has also been said that a judge of an inferior court cannot give himself jurisdiction by a wrong decision on the facts. With reference to this statement Lord Esher, M.R., in Regina v. Commissioners for Special Purposes of the Income Tax[15], points out that, although it is correct enough for certain purposes, its application is often misleading. It is correct where the legislature has said that, if certain facts exist, the judge shall have jurisdiction. In such a case the existence of the facts is a condition precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction. The statement, however, is inaccurate where the legislature entrusts the tribunal with a jurisdiction which includes the jurisdiction to determine whether the preliminary state of facts exists, as well as jurisdiction on finding that it does exist, to proceed further and do something more. In a case of this kind the jurisdiction is conferred not conditionally upon the facts actually existing, but upon a finding that they do exist. The rule, I think, may be stated in another way, as follows:\u2014\nIf the existence or non-existence of the jurisdiction of a judge of an inferior court depends upon a question of fact, then, if, upon the facts proved or admitted he has no jurisdiction, his finding that he has jurisdiction will not prevent prohibition, but if the jurisdiction depends upon contested facts and there has been a real conflict of testimony upon some fact which goes to the question of jurisdiction, and the judge decides in such a way as to give himself jurisdiction, a superior court, on an application for prohibition, will hesitate before reversing his finding of fact and will only do so where the grounds are exceedingly strong. Mayor of London v. Cox[16]; Brown v. Cocking[17]; Liverpool Gas Company v. Everton[18]; Rex v. Bradford[19].\nTo determine whether prohibition lies in the present case it is essential to see precisely what was decided. In his judgment the Recorder said that\nhaving regard to the true purpose of the by-law and the discharge of his duties by the accused,\nthe case was indistinguishable from that of City of Montreal v. Davignon. Turning to his judgment in the Davignon case (a copy of which has been furnished to us), we find that there the accused was likewise an employee of the Fuller Brush Company and that he was charged with the same offence as the appellant; that the same defences were set up, and that the accused was convicted. After disposing of the constitutional questions raised the Recorder proceeded as follows:\u2014\nTaking up the second main ground of defence, it is established that accused was in the exclusive employ of Fuller Brush Company Ltd. within an assigned territory. * * * The accused reported every morning to an office of the company *\u2019 * * where he had no exclusive desk room. He would proceed thence to his assigned territory, within the limits of the city and leave in any house he selected a card entitling the recipient to a free brush. Accused, a day or so later, Within his own discretion, would call at the houses where he had left the cards, give away a brush and, by means of a case of samples, try and sell some of the large variety of brushes manufactured by the Fuller Brush Co. Ltd. * * *\nIt is quite clear then, that the accused was his own master in so far as his occupation as canvasser is involved. He carried through his selling campaign upon his own initiative, * * *\nDid the Recorder by this language mean to hold that once it was established that the accused was soliciting orders for the sale of goods in private houses, the by-law constituted that act \u201cdoing business as canvasser,\u201d or did he mean that he found as a fact that the accused was doing business as canvasser within the meaning of the by-law? If the former, he misinterpreted the by-law; if the latter, he made an erroneous finding of fact. Does prohibition lie on either view?\nA good working rule as to when prohibition lies was laid down by Tyndal, C.J., in the old case of Cave v. Mountain[20], and was approved and adopted by Lord Denham in Rex v. Bolton[21], and by Avory J. in Rex v. Bloomsbury Income Tax Commissioners[22], as follows:\u2014\nBut if the charge be of an offence over which, if the offence charged be true in fact, the magistrate has jurisdiction, the magistrate\u2019s jurisdiction cannot be made to depend upon the truth or falsehood of the facts, or upon the evidence being sufficient or insufficient to establish the corpus delicti brought under investigation.\nIn the present case the charge was that the appellant had been doing business as canvasser without a licence. If the complaint was true in fact there can be no doubt of the jurisdiction of the Recorder for, in imposing the penalty, he was simply enforcing the by-law. If the charge was not true in fact but the Recorder found that it was, he must still be within his jurisdiction for he cannot have jurisdiction if he decides one way, and be without jurisdiction if he decides the other way.\nIf the Recorder\u2019s judgment is to be considered as a misinterpretation of the by-law, then, applying the rule laid down in Township of Ameliasburg v. Pitcher[23], we have to ask ourselves if the Recorder construed the by-law in order to find out if he had jurisdiction to decide the rights of the parties at all. The answer to that question must be in the negative for the simple reason that jurisdiction to try the action was not conferred by the by-law but by the statute. (Art. 484). Therefore whether we take the imposition of the penalty as based simply upon the Recorder\u2019s finding of fact or upon his construction of the by-law, he was acting within his jurisdiction, and prohibition does not lie.\nI quite agree that if the statute had given the Recorder jurisdiction only where the person charged had been actually doing business as canvasser, then, upon this court coming to the conclusion that he had not been doing business, it would be our duty to direct a writ of prohibition to issue. The statute, however, did not so limit his jurisdiction.\nA case in this court very similar to the one before us is that of Molson v. Lambe[24]. There the defendant was an employee of Molson & Bros., brewers, and was charged with selling liquor without being duly licensed to do so. His employers, as brewers, had a licence to sell liquor and he contended that, as he was merely an employee of Molson & Bros. and was selling under their instructions, that the statute did not apply to him. He was convicted however, and an application was made to the Superior Court for a writ of prohibition. On appeal to this court it was held that prohibition did not lie.\nIn Regina v. Judge of Greenwich County Court[25], it was held that an erroneous decision as to the admissibility of evidence, or a decision without any evidence to support it, given by a county court judge in a matter in which he has jurisdiction, is not ground for a prohibition. In his judgment Fry, L.J., at page 250, said:\u2014\nIn the case of Home v. Earl Camden[26], Eyre, C.J., says: \u201cIt must be admitted that the misinterpretation of either the common or statute law, in a proceeding confessedly within the jurisdiction of these courts, and where they are bound to exercise their judgment upon one or the other, seems to be rather a matter of error, to be redressed in the course of the appeal which the law has provided, than a ground of prohibition.\u201d I say, therefore, that this being a proceeding professedly within the jurisdiction of the County Court, the question whether there was any legal evidence upon which to grant a new trial is also within the jurisdiction of that court. A wrong decision of the County Court Judge upon that question is not ground for a prohibition.\nTo like effect were the judgments of the Master of the Rolls and Lopes, L.J.\nIn an action for the enforcement of a by-law (which this action clearly is), the Recorder, in my opinion, has jurisdiction\u2014in fact it is his duty\u2014to determine not only all facts relevant to the case but also the meaning to be put on the by-law. How else can he try the action?\nIt is suggested that the same principle should be applied here as in cases of assessments to land tax where it has been held that prohibition will lie if the land in question is, in fact, not subject to land tax. But, as Mr. Justice Bray points out in Rex v. Kensington Income Tax Commissioners[27], the reason for these decisions is that there is no jurisdiction to assess unless the land is liable to the tax. In each case the extent of the jurisdiction of an inferior court must, in the last resort turn upon the statute conferring jurisdiction.\nCounsel for the appellant further contended that even if the Recorder had jurisdiction to try the action yet prohibition would lie if he applied a wrong principle of law to the facts, and he cited 10 Halsbury, 142, where the learned author says:\u2014\n289. Prohibition lies not only for excess or absence of jurisdiction, but also for the contravention of some statute or the principles of the common law.\nThe authorities cited in support of the statement are: Maconochie v. Penzance (Lord)[28]; Veley v. Burder[29]; Gould v. Gapper[30]; White v. Steele[31]. I have perused all these cases and I find that the prohibitions therein granted were directed to the Ecclesiastical or the Admiralty courts, both of which had a special jurisdiction and decided numerous matters coming before them in accordance with the canon or the civil law as distinguished from the common law. In such courts where a statute was given a meaning different from that which the common law courts gave it, or where these courts declared the common law to be something different from that which the common law courts declared it to be, prohibition would issue. The reason for this was that it was the duty of the common law courts under the constitution to declare the common law and expound the statute law and it would have been considered a scandal if a statute or a common law rule were given one interpretation in one court, and another and inconsistent interpretation in another court. The principle upon which prohibition was granted in these cases cannot, however, have any application to the case before us. As was stated by Patterson J. in In re Bowen[32]:-\nThis is not exactly like Gould v. Gapper[33], where it was held that prohibition lies where a spiritual court puts a wrong construction on a statute. The County Court is different from a court of peculiar jurisdiction; it is a temporal court which proceeds on the same rules as we do ourselves and, therefore, we cannot interfere when it has decided upon the construction of a statute in a subject-matter over which it clearly has jurisdiction.\nEven if in other jurisdictions prohibition lies for the misinterpretation of a statute, it cannot apply in this case, for article 1003 C.C.P. limits the cases in which prohibition can be granted in the province of Quebec to those wherein the inferior court has exceeded its jurisdiction.\nThe last argument advanced on behalf of the appellant was that both the by-law and the enabling statute were ultra vires as being indirect taxation. In answer to this contention nothing more, in my opinion, need be said than that the British North America Act, section 92 (9), gives the provincial legislature exclusive power to make laws in relation to\nshop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer, and other licences, in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial, local or municipal purposes.\nIt is not disputed that the object of the by-law was to provide additional revenue for the City of Montreal. In Brewers & Malsters\u2019 Association for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Ontario (1), the Privy Council had before it the question as to whether the licence required to be obtained by a brewer in order to sell wholesale was direct taxation. It was held that it was. As to subsection 9 of section 92, their Lordships said:\u2014\nThey do not doubt that general words may be restrained to things of the same kind as those particularized, but they are unable to see what is the genus which would include \u201cshop, saloon, tavern\u201d and \u201cauctioneer\u201d licences and which would exclude brewers\u2019 and distillers\u2019 licences.\nThe appeal should be dismissed but without costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Beaulieu, Gouin & Mercier.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Saint-Pierre, Damphousse, Butler, Parent & Choquette.\n[1] (1929) Q.R. 46 K.B. 375.\n[2] (1929) Q.R. 46 K.B. 376, at 377.\n[3] [1841] 1 Q.B. 66.\n[4] (1906) 13 O.L.R. 417 at 420.\n[5] [1899] 1 Q.B. 7.\n[6] (1888) 20 Q.B.D. 780.\n[7] (1874) 15 N.B.R. 147.\n[8] (1920) 13 Sask.

C. Evidence of the general reputation of a house is admissible to show that it is a bawdy house.\nHeld that, in view of such rule, it was sufficient, in order to affirm the appellant's conviction, that the evidence made it clear that the house was being maintained for the purpose of prostitution without direct proof of the act itself and that such proof may be made, not only by bringing evidence of general reputation but also of such facts, circumstances and conditions as would warrant the inference and belief that the house was being so maintained. More particularly it is clear that, under s. 986 [1] Cr. C., the delay that occurred in opening the premises on the demand of the police officers was prima facie evidence of guilt.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[2], dismissing (Lunney J.A. dissenting) the appellant's appeal against her conviction for keeping and maintaining a common bawdy house. The material facts of the case and the conditions existing at the house when the arrest was made have been summarized by Mitchell J., who delivered the judgment of the majority of the appellate court, as follows:\nAbout 6 p.m. two city constables proceeded to the house and found it occupied by the accused. The front portion of the building purported to be a confectionery store. At the rear are living rooms occupied by a Chinese cook, and at times one or two girls. Adjacent to this is what is known as the private dwelling of the accused. The stock consists of a very limited supply of cigarettes, cigars and soft drinks. The shelving contains only \"dummies.\" The city shop licence held by accused covering 1930 had not been renewed. The entrance to the shop portion is kept locked and bolted at all times. The window in the entrance door is screened, the view blocked and the glass barred over with a strong wire screen. The constables have \"visited these premises off and on every few days in the past three months\" and are known to the accused. The police find it difficult to obtain ready access to the place but customers are scrutinized and have little difficulty in gaining admission. No person wishing to purchase goods could get in there without being scrutinized. On the evening in question the constables, after considerable delay, were admitted to the premises by the accused. The latter first pulled aside the window curtain of the door to ascertain who were there, and instead of opening the door ran back into the room behind the store, later returning and admitting the constables who proceeded to the room in the rear of the premises. There they found the accused who was apparently in charge, and known to be owner of the store. A man was found seated on a couch, wearing an overcoat unbuttoned. Upon closer examination it was found that the fly of his pants \"was all unbuttoned.\" A girl was found in a clothes closet, and on coming therefrom was seen to be adjusting her dress in some manner. This girl disappeared from the place almost immediately and has not since been seen by the police. During the past three months there have been two or three different girls stopping in this house, and men have been seen going to and coming from the same. One constable describes the traffic as heavy. What appears to have been a somewhat unusual supply of liquor was found in the adjoining house described as the accused's private dwelling. Upon being questioned by Constable Clarke as to why his pants were unbuttoned, the visitor gave the significant reply \"Well you know.\" Two weeks previous to the occasion now in question, the same constables upon making an examination of the house were attracted by the action of the Chinaman cook adjusting an oil cloth on the floor of the toilet room and discovered a trapdoor in the floor beneath which a girl was concealed. They also at that time \"saw in the toilet a laundry bag containing a number of used towels such as are used in these places.\" The evidence as to the general reputation of the premises is in the main, as follows:\u2014\nConstable Clarke:\n\"Q. What is the general reputation of the place?\u2014A. Oh, bawdy house. The accused several times when we have been going in or coming out, the accused has come out to the sidewalk and looked East and West to see if we were about. That is the general condition.\"\nConstable Hunter:\n\"Q. What would you say as to the general reputation of this house?\u2014A. It is known to the police as a bawdy house. Court: You say it is known to the police as a disorderly house?\u2014A. Yes.\nMr. Cameron: Q. What is that based on?\u2014A. The reputation you mean?\nQ. Yes, there has to be something to base it on. Did some one tell you it was a bawdy house?\u2014A. Well, I have gained my knowledge as a constable on the beat from those I came in contact with.\nCourt: Q. You were on beat there?\u2014A. Yes, for years, and I know the places well.\nMr. Cameron: Q. That is all you found the reputation on?\u2014A. Just merely on this ground.\nQ. Men coming in and out?\u2014A. I have no knowledge of the act of prostitution other than the traffic that has been observed.\nA. M. Sinclair K.C. for the appellant.\nW. S. Gray K.C. for the respondent.\nOn conclusion of the argument by counsel for the appellant and for the respondent, heard during the morning sitting of the court, judgment was reserved; and at the opening of the afternoon sitting, the judgment of the court was orally delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014In this case the appellant was convicted by a stipendiary magistrate for keeping a common bawdy house. Lunney J. dissents on the alleged ground that there was no evidence. This is the only possible ground of law which could be urged, as, if the question were one of weight of evidence, there would be no appeal to this court under section 1023 of the Criminal Code.\nOn examination of the matter, we are inclined to the view that the judgment of Lunney J. amounts to nothing more than a holding that the weight of evidence does not justify the conviction and that no question of law is involved in the appeal; but, assuming that the question should be regarded as one of law, i.e., that the dissent is based on the ground that there is no evidence to warrant the inference of guilt, we are all clearly of the opinion that there was evidence on which it could well be found that the accused was guilty.\nWhatever doubt there might be as to the propriety of the finding that the other circumstances in evidence establish a case of prima facie guilt against the accused, it is entirely clear that, under section 986 (1) Cr. C., the delay that occurred in opening the premises on the demand of the police officers was prima facie evidence of guilt. The evidence of the facts in this particular is uncontradicted and suffices to maintain the conviction.\nThe evidence of the circumstances set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Mitchell is as follows:\nIt is well settled that evidence of a general reputation of a house is admissible to show that it is a bawdy house. It is an element tending to establish the offence charged. Clarke J.A., in Rex v. Roberts[3], has pointed out that \"the gist of the offence is the keeping of the house for purpose of prostitution, not the act of committing fornication.\" Having this in mind it seems to me that it is sufficient in this case, if the evidence makes it clear that the house was being maintained for a specific purpose without direct proof of the act itself. This may well be done by proof, not only of a general reputation but of such facts, circumstances and conditions as would warrant the inference and belief that the house was being so maintained.\nThe inference may be drawn in this instance from the manner in which the place was conducted, the arrangement of the premises, the presence of men and women, the frequency of the visits to the place by men and the hours, their appearance and conduct, as well as any other circumstance tending to show the likelihood of unlawful intercourse between the sexes, and particularly the conditions at the time of the arrest.\nHere we have present many of the elements from which, when coupled with general reputation, guilt may properly be inferred. The suggestive answer to the constable, \"You know\" when interrogated respecting the condition of his trousers, the unusual action of the female inmate, are all of significance and relative to the charge.\nWe agree with what Mr. Justice Mitchell said and, accordingly, this appeal must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] [1897] A.C. 231, at 235, 237.\n[2] (1931) 25 Alta.

C. The question on the appeal was whether the word \"distribute\" as used in s. 4 (f) of the Opium and Narcotic Drugs Act covered the facts in the case.\nHeld, affirming the appellants' conviction, that, upon the evidence, the appellants had the drugs in question for distribution and that they did in fact \" distribute \" them. The appellants cannot contend that, because two separate sales were proved in evidence, two offences were actually charged, as there could be no distribution unless more than one sale was proved.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, dismissing (Macdonald C.J. dissenting), the appellants' appeal against their conviction of having unlawfully distributed drugs.\nThe question in this appeal is whether the word \" distributes\" as used in s. 4 (f) of Chap. 144, R.S.C., 1927, Opium and Narcotic Drugs Act, which enacts that\nEvery person who\n(f) manufactures, sells, gives away or distributes any drug to any person without first obtaining a licence from the Minister;\nshall be guilty of a criminal offence ***.\ncovers this case.

How could distribution be shown unless more than one sale was proved? A single sale probably does not amount to \" distribution \" within the meaning of that word, as used in the Criminal Code. There is nothing to restrict what may be proved as evidence of distribution to a single sale.\nIt is manifest that the defendants had the drugs in question for distribution and the proof shows they did in fact \" distribute \" them. That seems to be all that is necessary.\nAs to the difficulty created by the words \" to any person \" found in the section in question, it is fully met by the interpretation clause in s. 31 (j) of c. 1 of R.S.C., 1927, and by the admission of counsel for the appellant that \" any person \" includes \" any persons.\"\nWe are all of the opinion that the appeal fails and must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J.

J. and his wife were alive, and had eight children living, all minors and residing with J. in the United States. The trust fund was invested in Canadian stocks and bonds, held by respondent in Montreal, Canada, where the income was accumulating and being invested in Canadian stocks and bonds.\nHeld (reversing judgment of Audette J. in the Exchequer Court, [1930] Ex. C.R. 172): The income was \u201caccumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons, or of persons with contingent interests,\u201d and taxable in respondent\u2019s hands, under s. 3 (6) of said Act (as enacted 1920, c. 49, s. 4). Such income accumulating in trust is distinctly a subject of taxation under s. 3 (6), regardless of the residence, if ascertainable, of probable beneficiaries, whose interest is contingent during the taxation period.\nThe above holding accords with the decision of this Court in McLeod v. Minister of Customs and Excise, [1926] Can. S.C.R. 457, which, having affirmed the judgment below on an equal division of opinion may not be binding as an authority on this Court (Stanstead Election case, 20 Can. SCR. 12), but is entitled to great respect. APPEAL by the Minister of National Revenue from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada (Audette J.)[1] allowing the present respondent\u2019s appeal from the decision of the Minister of National Revenue confirming the assessment levied on income for the year ending 31st December, 1927, received by the present respondent as trustee under a certain deed of donation.\nJohn Day Jackson, a resident of New Haven, in the State of Connecticut, one of the United States of America, executed a deed of donation in trust, before a notary public in Montreal, Province of Quebec, dated 19th February, 1918, in favour of The Royal Trust Company (the present respondent) as Trustee, whereby, in consideration of the love and affection he bore towards his children, he gave as a donation inter vivos and irrevocable, unto the Trustee in. trust for the purposes therein mentioned, the Canadian securities described in the schedule to the deed. In the deed it was, among other things, provided, and the Trustee covenanted, that the Trustee should hold the securities upon trust as follows:\n(a) For the benefit of the surviving children of the Donor until five years after the death of the Donor, the property described and set forth in Schedule \u201cA\u201d hereto, together with all accumulations and additions thereto, when the entire Trust Estate is to be equally divided amongst his surviving children, and in the event of any or all of his said children predeceasing the Donor or being-unable to take, the division shall be made to the survivor or survivors, and the issue of such predeceased child or children, as representing their parent, per stirpes;\n(b) Upon the termination of the said Trust, the said Trust Estate shall be converted into cash and distributed as set forth in the preceding paragraph hereof, with all due diligence.\nThe following facts were admitted:\n\u201c1. John Day Jackson and his wife are both alive at this time.\n\u201c2. The age of Mrs. Jackson is 42; Mr. Jackson 61.\n\u201c3. There are eight children by the marriage presently living, all minors.\n\u201c4. The capital of the trust fund set forth in Schedule A is invested in Canadian stocks and bonds, which are held by the trustee in the city of Montreal, where the income therefrom is accumulating and being invested in Canadian. stocks and bonds by the trustee, the income from the investments likewise accumulating and subject to the same trusts.\n\u201c5. The trustee is a Canadian company incorporated under the Laws of the Province of Quebec, and carrying on business in Canada with power to act as a trustee.\u201d\nIt was admitted in the pleadings that the said John Day Jackson is an American citizen and resides at New Haven, Connecticut, U.S.A.; that his said eight children, all minors, live with him and reside at New Haven aforesaid; that since the receipt by the trustee of the securities mentioned in the deed of donation, the trustee had received the income therefrom and retained the same in accordance with the provisions of the said deed; that from time to time since the execution of the deed, the question of tax payable under the Income War Tax Act on the income received from the trust property had been under discussion with the officers of the Department of National Revenue; that in recent years income tax had been paid under protest and pending a decision of the income tax authorities as to liability; that an assessment covering the 1927 period had been received by the trustee, and a tax levied in the sum of $147.39, which had been paid by the trustee without prejudice to its rights in the appeal; that the trustee, in accordance with the provisions of the Income War Tax Act, gave notice of appeal; that the Minister affirmed the assessment; and that the trustee filed a notice of dissatisfaction with the Minister\u2019s decision.\nAudette J., in the Exchequer Court[2], decided in favour of the trustee, the present respondent; its appeal from the Minister\u2019s decision was allowed, and the assessment set aside. Leave to the Minister to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted by a judge thereof.\nThe appellant relied on ss. 2, 3 and 4 of the Dominion Income War Tax Act, 1917, c. 28 (as amended), reading in part as follows:\n2 (d). \u201cPerson\u201d means any individual or person and any syndicate, trust, association or other body and any body corporate, and the heirs, executors, administrators, curators and assigns or other legal representatives of such person * * *\n3 (6). [As enacted by s. 4 of c. 49, 1920]. The income, for any taxation period, of a beneficiary of any estate or trust of whatsoever nature shall be deemed to include all income accruing to the credit of the taxpayer whether received by him or not during such taxation period. Income accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons or of persons with contingent interests shall be taxable in the hands of the trustees or other like persons acting in a fiduciary capacity, as if such income were the income of an unmarried person.\n4 (1). There shall be assessed, levied and paid, upon the income during the preceding year of every person residing or ordinarily resident in Canada * * * the following taxes:\u2014* * *.\nand contended that the respondent, in whose hands the income was accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons or persons with contingent interests, was liable to the tax as a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of the Act, resident in Canada; that residence of the beneficiaries of a trust for unascertained persons cannot be a factor in determining whether the accumulated income for such unascertained persons in or is not taxable as against the trustee; that s. 3 (6) is a complete taxing measure within itself; that the present case was on all fours with McLeod v. Minister of Customs and Excise[3], on which the appellant relied.\nThe respondent contended that the John Day Jackson Trust was not a \u201cperson\u201d within the definition in the Act; that the taxing section of the Act only applies to residents of Canada, and that the income of the trust, being the income of the beneficiaries of the trust and such beneficiaries not being residents of Canada, was not taxable; that the beneficiaries of the trust were not unascertained persons or persons with contingent interests within the meaning of s. 3 (6); they were the children of the donor and were capable of being ascertained at any time and were ascertainable for the 1927 taxation period; the class was definite and ascertained, and this definite ascertainment of the class was sufficient to enable the gift to vest; nor was there any contingency which could take the income away from the children or their descendants; that McLeod v. Minister of Customs and Excise3 was distinguishable on the facts, and was not contrary to respondent\u2019s contentions in the present case.\nC. F. Elliott K.C. and W. S. Fisher for the appellant.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and S. G. Dixon K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014In our opinion this appeal must be allowed.\nThe Income War Tax Act provides expressly for the taxation of accumulating income held in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons, or of persons having contingent interests. The income is made\ntaxable in the hands of the trustees or other like persons acting in a fiduciary capacity, as if such income were the income of an unmarried person.\n(Subsection 6 of Section 3 of the Income War Tax Act, 1917, as enacted by section 4 of chapter 49 of the Statutes of 1920; see also section 10 of the Act of 1920).\nWhether the word \u201ctrust\u201d means a person or body holding the property, or distributing the trust estate, or means the property itself, or means the trust upon which such property is held, is quite immaterial in view of what is said above.\nThose who are at the present time probable beneficiaries of the trust, or some of them, it is true, reside in the United States. But that fact does not prevent this case coming within subsection 6 of section 3 above referred to, nor render exempt from taxation in the hands of trustees income accumulated on a trust for unascertained beneficiaries or beneficiaries having contingent interests. On the contrary, in our opinion, such income accumulating in trust is distinctly a subject of taxation under the subsection referred to, regardless of the residence, if ascertainable, of probable beneficiaries, whose interest is contingent during the taxation period.\nThis view accords with that which prevailed in the case of McLeod v. Minister of Customs and Excise[4]. It may be that that decision is not binding upon this court because there the judgment below was affirmed on an even division of opinion amongst the judges who constituted the Supreme Court. (See Stanstead Election case, Rider v. Snow (2)[5]). It is, nevertheless, entitled to great respect.\nWe are, accordingly, of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed and that judgment should be entered for the appellant, with costs here and in the Exchequer Court, upholding the income tax assessment in question.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

The intention of the Act was to levy the tax on the sale price of all goods produced or manufactured in Canada, whether they be sold by the manufacturer or consumed by himself for his own purposes. Respondent could not avoid liability by invoking the wording of s. 87 (d) of the Act.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court, [1931] Ex.

During the period from February 1, 1924, to August 31, 1928, the defendant was engaged, inter alia, in the production, manufacture and sale to the lumber trade of long and short lumber and was in possession of a sales tax licence issued to it under the provisions of s. 5 of c. 68, 14-15 George V (1924), An Act to amend The Special War Revenue Act, 1915 (now s. 95 of the Special War Revenue Act, c. 179, R.S.C., 1927).\nDuring the said period the defendant was also engaged in the course of the development of its business in the construction and building of pulp and other mills and in the repair thereof and in the construction, building and repair of houses and other structures for employees of the company, and in the course of such construction, building and repairing the defendant during the period aforesaid used or consumed certain quantities of long and short lumber in such work. All of such long and short lumber was taken from stock in the yards of the company, and produced and manufactured for sale and in no instance had been produced or manufactured especially for the purpose for which the same was used.\nThe question for the opinion of the court (under a special case stated for the opinion of the Exchequer Court) was whether or not the defendant was liable to pay His Majesty the King a consumption or sales tax in respect of the long and short lumber referred to in the next preceding paragraph.\nMaclean J.[2] held that the defendant was not liable, and the present appeal was from that decision. The appeal was allowed, with costs in this Court and in the Exchequer Court, and judgment directed to be entered in favour of the Crown (Cannon J. dissenting).\nF. P. Varcoe for the appellant.\nR. B. Hanson, K.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Smith JJ.) was delivered by\nSmith J.\u2014The respondent was a manufacturer of lumber for sale, and consumed a portion of the lumber so manufactured in construction and building operations, carried on over a period of years, the lumber so consumed having been taken from stock in the yards of the company, produced and manufactured in the ordinary course of the company\u2019s business of manufacturing for sale, and not produced or manufactured especially for the purpose for which it was used.\nThe appellant sued the respondent company for sales tax on the lumber so consumed, amounting to the sum of $7,302.90.\nSections 86 and 87 of the Special War Revenue Act are as follows:\n86. In addition to any duty or tax that may be payable under this Act or any other statute or law, there shall be imposed, levied and collected a consumption or sales tax of four per cent, on the sale price of all goods\n(a) produced or manufactured in Canada, payable by the producer or manufacturer at the time of the sale thereof by him;\n* * * * *\n87. Whenever goods are manufactured or produced in Canada under such circumstances or conditions as render it difficult to determine the value thereof for the consumption or sales tax because\n* * * * *\n(d) such goods are for use by the manufacturer or producer and not for sale;\nthe Minister may determine the value for the tax under this Act and all such transactions shall for the purposes of this Act be regarded as sales.\nThe learned President of the Exchequer Court, before whom the case was tried, dismissed the action[3], on the ground that the lumber so consumed was produced in the ordinary course of business for sale, and not specifically for use by the manufacturer, within the meaning of the above quoted s. 87 (d).\nWith great respect, I am unable to take this view of the meaning and effect of these provisions of the Act. To so construe them is to put a narrow and technical construction upon the precise words used in clause (d), without taking into consideration the meaning and intent of the statute as a whole. It seems to me clear that the real intention was to levy a consumption or sales tax of four per cent, on the sale price of all goods produced or manufactured in Canada, whether the goods so produced should be sold by the manufacturer or consumed by himself for his own purposes. The view taken in the court below would result in the introduction of an exception to the general rule that all goods produced or manufactured are to pay a tax, and would amount to a discrimination in favour of a particular consumer. As an example, it is not unusual for a manufacturer engaged in the production and manufacture of lumber for sale to engage at the same time in the business of a building contractor. He manufactures his lumber for sale, and, as a general rule, would not manufacture any specific lumber for use in connection with his building contracts, but would simply take lumber for these purposes from the general stock manufactured for sale, and might thus, under the view taken in the court below, escape taxation on all lumber thus diverted from the general stock manufactured for sale.\nI am of opinion that, construing the provisions of the Act as a whole, the respondent is liable for taxes on the lumber consumed by him, as claimed.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed with costs, and judgment entered in. the court below for the amount claimed, with costs.\nCannon, J. (dissenting)\u2014In the special case submitted for the opinion of the Exchequer Court of Canada, it is stated, and admitted by the Crown, that all the long and short lumber which we are called upon to declare liable to pay the \u201cconsumption or sales tax\u201d \u201cwas taken from stock in the yards of the Company, and produced and manufactured for sale and in no instance had been produced or manufactured especially for the purpose for which the same was used.\u201d\nOn the facts as stated above, I agree with the learned President of the Exchequer Court[4], because, although manufactured for sale, these goods were never sold; nor can they be taxed under section 86 of the Special War Revenue Act, nor under section 87, because they were not manufactured or produced in Canada for use by the manufacturer or producer, but for sale, as appears by the above mentioned statement of facts. In this case as in the Wampole case[5], in which judgment is rendered to-day, the facts agreed upon are such that the taxing provisions, as I understand them, are non-applicable.\nAs the Privy Council said in Crawford v. Spooner (1), \u201cWe cannot aid the Legislature\u2019s defective phrasing of the Act; we cannot add, and mend, and, by construction, make up deficiencies which are left there.\u201d If a statute professes to impose a charge, \u201cthe rule said the Judicial Committee in Oriental Bank Corporation v. Wright (2), is \u201cthat the intention to impose a charge on the subject must be shewn by clear and unambiguous language.\u201d\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

Wampole & Company, Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1931: May 20, 21; 1931: June 12.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nRevenue\u2014Sales tax\u2014Special War Revenue Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 179, ss. 86, 87\u2014\u201dUse\u201d by manufacturer (s. 87d)\u2014Goods distributed as free samples\u2014Statement in special case\u2014Effect of admission as to payment\u2014Double taxation.\nDefendant, in the course of its business as a manufacturer of pharmaceutical preparations, put up in special small packages and distributed free amongst physicians and druggists samples of its products, to acquaint them with their character and quality. The question in issue was whether or not defendant was liable for the consumption or sales tax in respect of the samples, under ss. 86 (a) and 87 (d) of the Special War Revenue Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 179. Clause 4 of the special case agreed on stated that \u201cthe cost of producing such samples was paid by [defendant] as a necessary expense of business, and [defendant] in its books treated such expense as a necessary cost of production of articles manufactured and sold, in respect of which last mentioned articles [defendant] has paid sales tax\u201d.\nHeld: The \u201cuse\u201d by the manufacturer or producer of goods not sold, dealt with in s. 87 (d), includes any use whatever that he may make of such goods, and is wide enough to cover their \u201cuse\u201d for advertising purposes by their distribution as free samples, and would have covered their use in the present case, and the samples would have been subject to the tax, but for said clause 4 of the special case, which must be taken as an admission that the sales tax had already been paid upon the cost of producing the samples for free distribution, in which case to hold them now subject to the tax would involve double taxation, which the legislature should not be taken to have intended. Therefore the judgment of the Exchequer Court (Maclean J.), [1931] Ex. C.R. 7, holding defendant not liable for the tax claimed, was affirmed in the result, but not for the reasons therein given. Newcombe J. dissented as to the effect of said clause 4, and would have allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding that the defendant (respondent) was not liable to pay a consumption or sales tax, under the Special War Revenue Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 179, ss. 86 (a) and 87 (d), on or in respect of certain samples of its products put up for distribution and distributed.\nA special case was agreed on between the parties for the opinion of the Exchequer Court, which read as follows:\n\u201c1. The defendant is an incorporated company having its head office in the town of Perth, in the province of Ontario, and its chief executive office at the town of Perth, in the province of Ontario.\n\u201c2. The defendant is and was during the period hereinafter referred to engaged in the manufacture and sale of drugs and pharmaceutical supplies, and as such was the holder of a licence under subsection 6 of section 19BBB of the Special War Revenue Act, 1915 (now section 95 of the Special War Revenue Act, R.S.C., 1927, chapter 179).\n\u201c3. The defendant in the course of its business as a manufacturer of pharmaceutical preparations put up in special small packages, samples of its products to be distributed amongst physicians and druggists as specimen or trial samples for the purpose of acquainting the physicians and druggists with the character and quality of the aforesaid pharmaceutical supplies. The said samples were, as a part of a well defined policy and in the ordinary course of business, distributed free of charge amongst the said physicians and druggists. \u201c4. The cost of producing such samples was paid by the company as a necessary expense of business, and the company in its books treated such expense as a necessary cost of production of articles manufactured and sold, in respect of which last mentioned articles the company has paid sales tax.\n\u201c5. There has been assessed, imposed and levied on the defendant a consumption or sales tax of $139.75 in respect of the said samples mentioned in paragraph 3 hereof.\n\u201c6. All acts have been done and all times have elapsed to entitle His Majesty the King to payment by the defendant of the sum of $139.75 and interest as hereinafter mentioned, if this Honourable Court shall hold, on the facts as above set out, that the defendant is liable to pay a consumption or sales tax on the samples aforesaid under and by virtue of section 19BBB, subsection 1, and subsection 13 (d) of the Special War Revenue Act, 1915 (now section 86a and section 87d of chapter 179 aforesaid).\n\u201c7. The question for the opinion of this Honourable Court is: whether on the facts as above stated and admitted herein, the defendant is liable to pay to His Majesty the King the consumption or sales tax on or in respect of the samples referred to in paragraph 3.\n* * * * *\nLeave to appeal from the judgment of Maclean J.[2] was granted to the Attorney-General of Canada by a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada.\nI. F. Hellmuth, K.C., and F. P. Varcoe for the appellant.\nH. A. O\u2019Donnell for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ) was delivered by\nAnglin, C.J.C.\u2014I was, at the hearing of this appeal, strongly of the view that the sample goods in question were subject to the tax sought to be collected in this case. My construction of clause (d) of section 87 is that the \u201cuse\u201d by the manufacturer or producer of goods not sold includes any use whatever that such manufacturer or producer may make of such goods, and is wide enough to cover their \u201cuse\u201d for advertising purposes by the distribution of them as free samples, as is the case here. I am, therefore, with great respect, unable to agree in the reasons assigned by the learned trial judge for dismissing this petition[3].\nBut, in clause 4 of the Special Case, we find the following statement :\n4. The cost of producing such samples was paid by the company as a necessary expense of business, and the company in its books treated such expense as a necessary cost of production of articles manufactured and sold, in respect of which last mentioned articles the company has paid sales tax.\nIt is obvious to me that it cannot have been the intention of the Legislature to tax the same property twice in the hands of the manufacturer. Having regard to the admission of paragraph 4, above quoted, such double taxation would ensue were we to hold the samples here in question to be now subject to the consumption or sales tax, it being there admitted that the cost of producing such samples is included in the\ncost of production of articles manufactured and sold, in respect of which * * * the company has paid sales tax.\nIf the cost or value of these goods used as samples has already been a subject of the sales tax in this way, it would seem to involve double taxation if they should now be held liable for sales tax on their distribution as free samples. But for the admission of paragraph 4, however, I should certainly have been prepared to hold that the \u201cuse\u201d by the company of goods manufactured by it as free samples for advertising purposes is a \u201cuse\u201d within clause (d) of section 87 of the Special War Revenue Act, R.S.C., 1927, ch. 179.\nIf it was not intended by paragraph 4 to make an admission that the sales tax had already been paid upon the cost of producing the samples for free distribution, that paragraph in the Special Case is wholly irrelevant and most misleading and I cannot understand the Crown assenting to its insertion unless it intended thereby to make the admission I have stated.\nFor these reasons the appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs. Newcombe, J. (dissenting).\u2014I am in agreement with my lord and my learned brethren as to the interpretation of the charging section; but I am not persuaded that the facts admitted by clause 4 of the case constitute payment, or operate to relieve the respondent company of its liability for the tax. If the sale price of the goods were increased by the company\u2019s method of book-keeping, I do not doubt that the fact would have been stated.\nI see nothing in the case to justify a finding of double taxation, or that the tax upon the samples, to which, in the view of the Court, the Government was entitled, has been paid; and I would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. Stuart Edwards.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Stewart, Hope & O\u2019Donnell.\n[1] [1931] Ex. C.R. 7.\n[2] [19311 Ex. C.R. 7.\n[3] [1931] Ex. C.R. 7.\n"}

Rule 72 for an application to be made to a judge- of the Supreme Court of Canada for special leave to appeal to this Court. (Strong doubt was expressed whether even the court exercising the original jurisdiction in bankruptcy could grant such extension\u2020).\nBy its decision made on February 7, 1931, and order dated February 28, 1931, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc dismissed an appeal from an order of Chisholm J., sitting in bankruptcy, setting aside an order of the Official Receiver for the sale to appellant of certain of the bankrupt\u2019s stock in trade. On March 10, 1931, said Court en banc made an order extending the time for application to a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal, to 60 days from February 7, 1931. The application came before Cannon J. on April 2, 1931, who dismissed it, holding that he had no jurisdiction, as the application was not made within the period (30 days from pronouncement of the decision complained of) fixed by Rule 72, and the order extending the time was made without jurisdiction.\nBankruptcy Act, R.S.C., 1927, c 11, ss. 174, 163 (5), 2 (l), 152; Bankruptcy Rules 72, 68, considered.

The material facts of the case, for the purposes of the present judgment, are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported and are indicated in the above head note. The application was dismissed with costs, on the ground that it was made too late and a judge of this Court had now no jurisdiction to entertain it.\nE. F. Newcombe K.C. for the applicant.\nPierre Casgrain K.C. for the respondent.\nCannon J.\u2014This is an application brought before me in chambers on the 2nd day of April, 1931, by Max Valinsky, for special leave to appeal to this court from the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco rendered herein on February 7, 1931 (1), and to fix the security for costs. The material facts are the following:\nOn 14th June, 1930, Louis Webber made an assignment for the benefit of creditors.\nOn 16th June, 1930, the Official Receiver (Harris) appointed Canadian Credit Men\u2019s Trust Association, Custodian. On 21st June, 1930, an order was made by the (Registrar and) Official Receiver, for the sale of certain of the stock in trade, consisting of women\u2019s hats, to one Max Valinsky.\nOn 28th June, 1930, a meeting of the creditors of the bankrupt appointed George R. Bacon, Trustee, and authorized him to institute proceedings by way of appeal, to set aside the order of 21st June, and\nOn 30th June, 1930, Bacon appealed to the Judge in Bankruptcy to set that order aside.\nOn 6th August, 1930, Mr. Justice Chisholm[3] set aside and vacated the Official Receiver\u2019s order of 21st June.\nOn 20th September, 1930, Max Valinsky, the purchaser of the said stock in trade at the said sale, appealed against the order of the Bankruptcy Judge, and\nOn 28th February, 1931, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco dismissed Valinsky\u2019s appeal with costs, (Mellish J. and Paton J. dissenting)[4].\nOn 10th March, 1931, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco extended the time within which an application for leave to appeal could be made to a Judge of the Supreme Court of Canada, to 60 days from 7th February, 1931, (viz., to 8th April, 1931).\nThe learned counsel for the trustee opposed the application for several reasons, the first of which was that I had no jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal under the General Bankruptcy Rule 72, because this application is presented to me after thirty days from the pronouncing of the decision complained of. The relevant section and rule are:\n174. Any person dissatisfied with an order or decision of the court or a judge in any proceedings under this Act may appeal to the Appeal Court if the\n(a) question to be raised on the appeal involves future rights; or\n(b) order or decision is likely to affect other cases of a similar nature in the bankruptcy or authorized assignment proceedings; or\n(c) amount involved in the appeal exceeds five hundred dollars; or\n(d) appeal is from the grant or refusal to grant a discharge and the aggregate of the unpaid claims of creditors exceeds five hundred dollars.\n2. The decision of the Appeal Court upon any such appeal shall be final and conclusive unless special leave to appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court of Canada is obtained from a judge of that court. Rule 72:\nAn application for special leave to appeal from a decision of the Appeal Court and to fix the security for costs, if any, shall be made to a Judge of the Supreme Court of Canada within thirty days after the pronouncing of the decision complained of and notice of such application shall be served on the other party at least fourteen days before the hearing thereof.\nIs the order of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, rendered on the 10th March, 1931, extending the delay fixed by the above rule 72 for a further period of thirty days, making the time within which such application for special leave to appeal can be made a period of sixty days from February 7, 1931, sufficient to give me jurisdiction to hear this application and grant an appeal, if good cause is shown?\nThe applicant relies on section 163, paragraph 5, which says:\nWhere by this Act, or by General Rules, the time for doing any act or thing is limited, the court may extend the time either before or after the expiration thereof, upon such terms, if any, as the court may think fit to impose.\nThe court, as defined by sec. 2 (l), is the one \u201cwhich is invested with original jurisdiction in bankruptcy under this Act\u201d; and section 152 invests the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia during term, and in vacation or in chambers, \u201cwith such jurisdiction at law and in equity as will enable it to exercise original, auxiliary and ancillary jurisdiction in bankruptcy and in other proceedings authorized by the Act.\u201d\nIt appears to me that, even if the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia was empowered to extend the delay, such power should be exercised by a judge thereof exercising the original jurisdiction above defined. In this instance, however, the extension of delay was granted by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, whose jurisdiction is limited by section 152, par. 3, of the Bankruptcy Act \u201cto make or render on appeal asserted, heard and decided according to their ordinary procedure, except as varied by General Rules, the order or decision which ought to have been made or rendered by the court appealed from.\u201d\nClearly, in my mind, the Supreme Court in banco has no jurisdiction in bankruptcy, except on appeal from a decision or order covered by paragraphs a, b, c, or d of section 174. They cannot in the first instance hear or entertain a petition to extend the delay. Moreover, I entertain grave doubts whether such a petition could be granted even by the original court in bankruptcy.\nRule 68 reads as follows:\n68. No appeal from a judge to the Appeal Court shall be brought unless notice thereof is filed with the registrar and served within ten days after the pronouncing of the order or decision complained of or within such further time as may be allowed by a judge.\n(2) At or before the time of entering an appeal the party intending to appeal shall lodge in the court the sum of one hundred dollars to satisfy, in so far as the same may extend, any costs that the appellant may be ordered to pay. Provided that the Appeal Court may in any special case increase or diminish the amount of such security or dispense there with.\nThis clearly gives to a judge the right to extend the time to give notice of appeal to the Appeal Court. Rule 72, concerning the appeals to the Supreme Court, does not contain a similar provision and gives to no judge, either of the provincial courts or of this court, power to extend the thirty days within which an application for special leave to appeal and to fix the security for costs must be made to a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada. As pointed out by Mignault J., in In re Gilbert[5], \u201cthe time fixed by bankruptcy rule 72, supra, for applying for leave to appeal goes to the jurisdiction of the judge to whom this application is made and who here acts as persona designata\u201d ; and \u201cit is to be observed that these rules, provided they are not inconsistent with the terms of The Bankruptcy Act, must be judicially noticed and have effect as if enacted by the Act\u201d (section 161, R.S.C., 1927, chapter 11). I have no power to extend the delay and a fortiori the court below has no jurisdiction to do so, no more than they can issue an order allowing an appeal to this court. I agree with Harris C.J., in Eastern Trust Co. v. Lloyd Mfg. Co.[6], who says:\nAn examination of the bankruptcy Rules shows that they are a full and complete code and framed for the obvious purpose of providing summary and expeditious methods for determining questions arising in bankruptcy matters with the minimum of cost. It is of the utmost importance that bankrupt estates should be wound up as cheaply and expeditiously as possible and Parliament had the right in dealing with the question of bankruptcy and insolvency to do what I think it has done in this case\u2014prescribe a special procedure for determining questions raised in realizing the assets of the estate. A judgment of the Appeal Court can be depended upon by the trustee as \u201cres judicata,\u201d unless leave to appeal is obtained within 30 days; the object of the Act and Rules would be defeated if such leave could be granted at any time at the discretion of any judge.\nThe order extending the time for the present application was made without jurisdiction, could not, at all events, prevail against a statutory delay such as provided by rule 72, and, therefore, I cannot now entertain the application, which comes too late and is dismissed with costs.\nApplication dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the applicant (appellant): L.

APPLICATION for special leave to appeal from the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1] dismissing an appeal taken from the judgment of Barry, C.J.K.B., sitting in bankruptcy[2], dismissing an appeal taken from the decision of the Trustee of the estate in bankruptcy, disallowing claims of the appellants in so far as appellants claimed to be secured creditors under certain conditional sale agreements.\nOn July 30, 1930, Smith and Hogan, Limited, made an authorized assignment under the Bankruptcy Act. The respondent was elected trustee of the estate in bankruptcy. Each of the appellants filed with the trustee a proof of claim as a creditor of said Smith and Hogan, Limited, in which proof of claim it claimed to be a secured creditor in a certain sum ($5,541.16 in the one case, $2,057.84 in the other) at which it valued its security on certain automobiles under certain conditional sale agreements entered into by it with the said Smith and Hogan, Limited. The trustee notified each appellant that it disallowed its claim to be secured in respect of the automobiles as a conditional vendor. Each of the appellants then appealed from such disallowance to the Judge sitting in Bankruptcy. As in each case the facts were similar and the points of law at issue substantially the same, the appeals were consolidated on the hearing before the judge. The appeal came before Barry, C.J.K.B., who upheld the disallowance2. The appellants appealed to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, which dismissed the appeal without costs1. The date of the order of the Appeal Division was April 24, 1931.\nOn application to Barry, C.J.K.B., as the Judge sitting in Bankruptcy, he on May 19, 1931, granted an extension of the time for applying to a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada for special leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Appeal Division. The extension granted was until June 23, 1931.\nThe application for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada (now in question) came before Cannon J. on June 20, 1931.\nL. A. Forsyth K.C. for the applicant.\nNigel B. Tennarit for the respondent. Cannon J.\u2014Section 163, par. 5, of the Bankruptcy Act does not apply to appeals but only to acts or things to be done before the Court in Bankruptcy in the exercise of its original jurisdiction. Appeals are dealt with separately in section 174\u2014and Bankruptcy rules 68 to 71, 72 and 73. Rule 68 provides specifically for an extension by a judge of the court of original jurisdiction of the delay of ten days to serve notice of appeal to the Appeal Court, but rule 72 contains no such provision permitting, by any judge, the allowance of further time after the thirty days delay within which a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada has jurisdiction to receive an application for special leave to appeal to this Court. In this case, the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick rendered judgment on the 24th of April, 1931. This application, made on the 20th of June, 1931, comes too late, as the extension of delay granted cannot give me a power or jurisdiction expressly restricted by a statutory rule of Practice.\nThe application is therefore dismissed with costs.\nApplication dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the applicants (appellants): W. Arthur I. Anglin.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Inches & Hazen.\n\u2020 Reporter\u2019s note: See also In re Webber; Valinsky v. Bacon, ante p. 498, where Cannon J. held that the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc could not, nor could a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada, extend the time for such an application. In the present case, the extension, held to have been granted without jurisdiction, was granted by the judge exercising original jurisdiction in bankruptcy\n[1] (1931) 12 C.B.R. 468.\n[2] (1930) 12 \u0421.B.R. 93.\n2 (1930) 12 \u0421.B.R. 93.\n1 (1931) 12 C.B.R. 468.\n"}

C, s. 461\u2014Omission in charge of essential allegation to constitute the crime\u2014Power of amendment (Cr. C., s. 889(2))\u2014Evidence\u2014Conviction quashed.\nAppellants were convicted, in the County Court Judge\u2019s Criminal Court, on a charge of breaking and entering by night the shop of C. P. \u201cwith intent to commit an indictable offence, to wit, to assault one C. P. contrary to the form of statute in that behalf made and provided\u201d. The trial judge\u2019s finding against each appellant was \u201c[appellant] tried this day on a charge of shop breaking by night with intent. Found guilty.\u201d On appeal it was objected that in the charge the word \u201ctherein\u201d was omitted (after the word \u201coffence\u201d) and therefore the charge as laid did not come within s. 461, Cr. Code, and constituted no offence in law. The Crown contended that the objection was not open, as an amendment could have been made under s. 889(2), and, under s. 898, every objection to any indictment for any defect apparent on the face thereof must be taken by demurrer or motion to quash the indictment, before pleading.\nHeld: S. 889(2), by its terms, provides for amendment only where \u201cthe matter omitted is proved by the evidence\u201d; and there was no evidence to indicate that appellants broke or entered with\u2019 any intent to assault C. P., \u201ctherein\u201d or elsewhere, although there was evidence possibly justifying an inference of breaking in with intent to assault her son A. P. The charge, intended to be of an offence under s. 461, lacked an allegation essential to constitute the crime, namely, that the intent was to commit the assault (that is, on C. P., as charged) in the shop that was broken into; and there was no evidence that supplied this omission, so as to give foundation for an amendment under s. 889(2) that would make it in reality a charge under s. 461. Without amendment, and without proof of the crime intended to be described, there was a finding of guilty of the charge, as set out, which did not describe any crime. The conviction must therefore be quashed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, sitting as a Court of Appeal under the provisions of the Criminal Code, dismissing (Mellish and Ross JJ. dissenting) the present appellants\u2019 appeal from their conviction by Crowe, Co. C.J., at a sittings of the County Court Judge\u2019s Criminal Court for District No. 7, sitting at Sydney, in the county of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, on the charge for that they \u201cat New Waterford in the county of Cape Breton on or about the 22nd day of November, A.D. 1930, did wrongfully and unlawfully break and enter by night the shop of Selina Passerini, there situated with intent to commit an indictable offence, to wit, to assault one Celina Passerini contrary to the form of Statute in that behalf made and provided\u201d.\nThe material facts of the case and the issues in question are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was allowed and the conviction quashed.\nJ. W. Maddin, K.C., for the appellants.\nNeil R. M \u0441Arthur, \u041a.\u0421., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSmith, J.\u2014The three appellants were tried in the County Court Judge\u2019s Criminal Court of District No. 7, county of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, on the following charges:\n* * * for that they, the said Ignatius McNeil, William McNeil and Dennis McNeil, at New Waterford in the county of Cape Breton on or about the 22nd day of November, A.D. 1930, did wrongfully and unlawfully break and enter by night the shop of Celina Passerini there situated with intent to commit an indictable offence, to wit, to assault one Celina Passerini contrary to the form of Statute in that behalf made and provided.\nThat they, the said Ignatius McNeil, William McNeil and Dennis McNeil, at New Waterford in the county of Cape Breton, on or about the 22nd day of November, A.D. 1930, did wrongfully and unlawfully break and enter by night the dwelling house of Celina Passerini, there situated with intent to commit an indictable offence, to wit, assault upon one Celina Passerini contrary to the form of Statute in that behalf made and provided.\nThe accused elected to be tried by the judge without a jury, and the trial proceeded on the charges as above set out. The minute of election, as set out at page 34 of the record, is as follows:\u2014\nThe accused having been brought up for election on the charge that they did, on or about the 22nd day of November, A.D. 1930, at New Waterford in Cape Breton county, unlawfully break and enter by night the dwelling house of Mrs. Celina Passerini with intent to commit an indictable offence therein contrary to the form of Statute in that behalf made and provided;\nElected to be tried under the \u201cSpeedy Trials Act\u201d.\nIt is to be noted that the word \u201ctherein\u201d appears in this minute after the words \u201cindictable offence\u201d, but does not appear in the two charges set out. The record contains no minute of election as to the first charge.\nThe minute of trial sets out that the accused, on being arraigned on the following accusation, each pleaded not guilty, and the accusations are then set out in the same language as stated above.\nThe finding of the trial judge is as follows:\u2014\nIgnatius McNeil tried this day on a charge of shop breaking by night with intent. Found guilty.\nWilliam McNeil tried this day on a charge of shop breaking by night with intent. Found guilty.\nDennis McNeil tried this day on a charge of shop breaking by night with intent. Found guilty.\nIgnatius McNeil was sentenced to six months in the common gaol, William McNeil to two years in the Dorchester penitentiary, and Dennis McNeil to two years and six months in the Dorchester penitentiary.\nThe accused appealed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia against the conviction, and the appeal was dismissed by a majority of three to two. The intention evidently was to charge the accused parties with an offence under sec. 461 of the Criminal Code, and with an offence under sec. 462 of the Criminal Code, which read as follows:\u2014\n461. Breaking Shop, etc., with Intent.\u2014Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to seven years' imprisonment who, either by day or night, breaks and enters any of the buildings, or any pen, cage, den or enclosure mentioned in the last preceding section with intent to commit any indictable offence therein.\n462. Being Found in Dwelling-House at Night.\u2014Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to seven years' imprisonment who unlawfully enters, or is in, any dwelling-house by night with intent to commit any indictable offence therein.\nThe ground of appeal is that in each charge the word \" therein \" is omitted, and that therefore the charges as laid do not come within the sections referred to, and constitute no offence in law.\nThe Crown contends that this objection is not open to the accused, because an amendment could have been made under sec. 889(2) of the Criminal Code, and that under sec. 898 every objection to any indictment for any defect apparent on the face thereof must be taken by demurrer, or motion to quash the indictment, before the defendant has pleaded, and not afterwards; and, under subs. 2, no motion in arrest of judgment shall be allowed for any defect in the indictment which might have been taken advantage of by demurrer, or amended under authority of this Act. Section 889(2) reads as follows:\nIf it appears * * * that there is in the indictment, or in any count in it, an omission to state or a defective statement of anything requisite to constitute the offence, or an omission to negative any exception which ought to have been negatived, but that the matter omitted is proved by the evidence, the court before which the trial takes place, if of opinion that the accused has not been misled or prejudiced in his defence by such error or omission, shall amend the indictment or count as may be necessary.\nIt is contended that this section does not authorize an amendment that would change a charge that does not allege or describe any crime into a charge describing a crime, and that, in any case, there was no amendment here; so that the conviction is really on the charge as laid, that does not constitute a crime.\nIt is not necessary here to determine the extent to which this section goes in the matter of allowing amendments, because, by its terms, the amendment is only to be made. where the matter omitted is proved by the evidence. It, therefore becomes necessary to examine the evidence to ascertain if the matter omitted has been proved; that is, to ascertain whether or not it has been proved that the accused broke into the shop \" with intent to commit therein an indictable offence, to wit, to assault Celina Passerini\", or did enter the dwelling-house \" with intent to commit an indictable offence therein, to wit, assault upon one Celina Passerini \".\nI have perused the evidence very carefully from beginning to end, and I find no evidence whatever that suggests any such intent. The evidence establishes that the three accused broke in the door of Celina Passerini's shop a little after midnight, when some members of her family and some visitors were sitting in the dining-room, which is connected with the shop by a doorway, and when Celina Passerini, her son Angelo and some boarders were in bed upstairs. Celina Passerini came downstairs, and the following is her evidence as to what happened when she was standing on the step:\u2014\nQ. What happened when you were standing on the step?\nA. Dennis McNeil was there with beer bottles in his hand, and he said, \" Where is your - - - son? He won't live more than five minutes if I get him.\" And he make a spring to get by me and then he took a top off the stove and struck me on the leg.\nOn cross-examination, she states that when she came downstairs the three McNeils, her daughter Irene, Peter Guthro, one Dickson and Jack McKeigan were there in the dining room. The other McNeil boys were right behind, one leaning against the wall. The examination proceeds as follows:\u2014\nQ. Who was leaning against the wall, which one was it?\nA. Iggy, Ignatius there.\nQ. Where were the other fellows?\nA. Trying to get upstairs.\nQ. Did they have bottles?\nA. Yes, when they came in.\nShe states that they had a lot of bottles; that Dennis had one in each hand, and some in his pockets, and that he placed two on the table. Then we have the following:\u2014\nQ. You say they have two bottles?\nA. Not all; and they attempt to come upstairs. I tells him he is not going upstairs and then he pick up the piece of the stove and throw at me, the iron.\nIrene Passerini is asked what accused came for, and answers, \"Looking for Angelo \". This is all there is in reference to an assault. I think it is not possible to infer from this evidence that the premises were entered with the intention of committing an assault upon Celina Passerini. It indicates, I think, quite the contrary, namely, that the accused Dennis McNeil for the first time formed in his own mind alone an intent to assault Celina Passerini at the time she prevented him from going upstairs, because she so prevented him. Although she says \u201cthey attempted to come upstairs\u201d, it appears that only Dennis McNeil made such attempt, because she goes on to say, \u201cI tells him he is not going upstairs\u201d; and she has said just before that Ignatius was leaning against the wall; and in her examination in chief she referred to Dennis only as having tried to go upstairs. There is nothing to indicate that there was in the mind of any of the accused, at the time of breaking in, an intent to assault Celina Passerini, in the shop o\u013e elsewhere.\nThe enquiry addressed to her by the accused Dennis McNeil as to the whereabouts of her son, the threat made in reference to him, and the spring made to get past Celina Passerini on the stair, which she swears to, is evidence of an intent on the part of Dennis McNeil at that time to make an assault on her son, Angelo Passerini, and possibly might justify an inference that he broke in with that intent, and might possibly also justify the further inference that all three were acting with a common intent; but this is not a matter that arises for consideration here.\nThe meaning of the learned judge\u2019s finding, as I read it, is that all three accused broke into the shop with the intention of committing an assault as charged, that is, on Celina Passerini. He could not have had in mind an intent to commit an assault on anyone else, because there is no suggestion in the charges of an attempt to commit an assault on anyone but Celina Passerini. The particular place where accused intended to make the assault is not involved in the finding of guilty, because no particular place was alleged in the charge, and the finding is simply \u201cguilty\u201d. We therefore have what was intended to be a charge of an offence under sec. 461 of the Criminal Code which lacks an allegation essential to constitute the crime described in that section, namely, that the intent was to commit the assault in the shop that was broken into. There was no evidence that supplies this omission. It was after midnight, and the shop was closed. The accused first rapped at the back door of the dwelling part of the premises. There is nothing to warrant an inference that the intent at the time of breaking in was to assault Celina Passerini in the shop so as to give foundation for an amendment pursuant to sec. 889 (2) that would make it in reality a charge under sec. 461.\nWithout any amendment of this charge, which really does not describe any crime, and without any evidence that would amount to proof of the crime intended to be described in the first charge, there is a finding of guilty of this charge, as set out, that does not describe any crime.\nIf it is attempted to uphold the conviction on the ground that the accused might have been held guilty, on the evidence, of a charge under sec. 462, that is, of unlawfully entering or being in a dwelling house by night with intent to commit an indictable offence therein, to wit, an assault on Angelo Passerini, the obvious answer is that, even if an amendment to that effect could have been made under sec. 889 (2), there is no conviction for that offence.\nIf the learned judge\u2019s finding as recorded can be construed as a conviction under sec. 461 of the Code, there was in reality no charge before him under that section, and no evidence that proved an offence under that section. The appeal must therefore be allowed, and the conviction quashed.\nAppeal allowed; conviction quashed.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J. W. Maddin.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Neil R. McArthur.\n"}

King, Executors of the Will of Martin Roach, Deceased (Defendants) Respondents.\n1931: March 9; 1931: May 26.\nPresent: Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nWill\u2014Construction\u2014Vesting\u2014Power to divide and apportion\u2014Capacity of survivor of donees of power to execute it\u2014Equal division among beneficiaries.\nThe testatrix\u2019 will gave all her estate \u201cin the manner following,\u201d and then directed that the estate be held in trust by her executors, that her son John be maintained from it so long as he lived, and whatever portion was not used for him was, at his death, \u201cto be divided among my remaining sons and daughter as follows,\u201d and then directed that, after her sons Thomas and William each received $1,000, the entire balance of the estate was to be divided among the remaining two sons Martin and George and her daughter Mary \u201cas in the judgment of my son Thomas and my daughter Mary deem wise, fit and proper to divide and apportion the estate\u201d. One H., Thomas and Mary were appointed executors. The testatrix died in 1923, Martin in 1926, Mary in 1928, and John in 1929.\nHeld: (1) Upon the testatrix\u2019 death, Martin, George and Mary took vested interests (subject to the prior gifts and to the power of apportionment) in whatever portion of the estate was not used for John. The gift to them in remainder vested at once on the testatrix\u2019 death, although the division was postponed until John\u2019s death.\n(2) The power to Thomas and Mary to divide and apportion was a discretion only, which might or might not be exercised; the children took under the will, even if the power was not executed; they took through the executors who, under the will, held as trustees for them, and not through the named donees of the power; the gift was not subordinate to the exercise of the power; the power was not in the nature of a trust; it was a bare power given to two persons by name (and not annexed to the office of executorship), a \u201cjoint confidence,\u201d and so could not be executed by the survivor (Farwell on Powers, 3rd ed., p. 514, referred to); therefore Thomas, the surviving donee of the power, could not exercise it. S. 25 of The Trustee Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 150, did not apply.\n(3) The result was that, on John\u2019s death, and after payment of the legacies to Thomas and William, the residue of the estate belonged to George, the estate of Martin, and the estate of Mary, in equal shares.\nAPPEAL by George Roach from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] dismissing his appeal from the judgment of Logie J.[2], declaring (upon motion brought by way of originating notice on behalf of the surviving executor of the will of Cecilia Roach, deceased, for interpretation of the said will) that the estate of Martin Roach, deceased, the estate of Mary Rosella Kormann, deceased, and the said George Roach, are each entitled to one-third of the residue of the estate of Cecilia Roach, deceased, after payment of certain bequests under the said will.\nThe appellant contended that Martin Roach and Mary Rosella Kormann did not acquire any vested interest in the estate of the testatrix, Cecilia Roach, at the time of the latter\u2019s death, and, having predeceased John Roach, never acquired any interest in the estate; that until the power to divide had accrued there could be no vesting in the objects of the power; that the appellant, who survived John Roach, was alone entitled to the residue of the estate after payment of the legacies to Thomas Roach and William J. Roach. Alternatively, the appellant contended that, if the court should hold that the time of vesting was on the death of the testatrix, Cecilia Roach, then Thomas Roach (the survivor of the two who were given the power to divide and apportion) had power to divide and apportion the said residue among the estate of Martin Roach, deceased, the estate of Mary Rosella Kormann, deceased, and the appellant, as he (Thomas Roach) deemed wise, fit and proper.\nThe provisions of the will in question and the material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs. J.C. McRuer, K.C., and F.A. Browin for the appellant.\nA.J. Holmes for the respondent, the executor of the will of Mary Rosella Kormann, deceased.\nF.D. Hogg, K.C., for the respondent, Thomas Roach, surviving executor of the will of Cecilia Roach, deceased.\n(No one appeared for the respondents, the executors of the will of Martin Roach, deceased.)\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014This is a motion brought by way of originating notice in the Supreme Court of Ontario for interpretation of the last will and testament of the late Cecilia Roach. The will reads as follows:\nI Revoke all former Wills and other Testamentary Dispositions by me at any time heretofore made, and declare this to be my last Will and Testament.\nI Direct all my just debts and funeral and testamentary expenses to be paid and satisfied by my executor and trustees hereinafter named.\nI Give, Devise, and Bequeath all my Real and Personal Estate which I may die possessed of or interested in, in the manner following, that is to say:\nI direct that my entire Estate both Real and Personal shall be held in trust by my Executors and trustees hereinafter named and my son John Roach M.D. will be maintained from my estate after the maintenance given him from his Father\u2019s Estate is exhausted and that the entire Estate be held in trust for him and for him only so long as he lives.\nWhatever portion of my Estate is not used in behalf of my son John Roach M.D. as herebefore directed at the time of his demise such portion is then to be divided among my remaining sons and daughter as follows:\nAfter my son Thomas Roach, Priest and William J. Roach Priest each receive One Thousand Dollars legacy then the entire balance of the Estate is to be divided among the remaining two sons Martin Roach and George Roach and my daughter Mary Rosella Kormann as in the judgment of my son Thomas and my daughter Mary Rosella deem wise, fit and proper to divide and apportion the Estate.\nMy Executors and trustees are to dispose of my Real Estate only when and as same can be done advantageously.\nI direct that my Executors and trustees shall apply One Hundred Dollars of my Estate for Masses for the Repose of my soul after death and Two Hundred Dollars for Monument to be erected for my deceased husband and myself.\nAnd I nominate and appoint Thos. P. Hart, Estate Agent of the Town of Orillia, Ont., and my son Thomas Roach, Priest and my Daughter Mary Rosella Koranan to be executors and trustees of this my last Will and Testament.\nIn Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my Hand the day and year first above written.\nThe testatrix died on the 9th of June, 1923.\nJohn Roach, M.D., for whom the entire estate was to be held in trust so long as he lived, died on the 5th of February, 1929. During his lifetime, he received the maintenance directed in the will.\nMartin Roach died on the 1st of March, 1926, and, by his will duly probated, named as executors his widow and Frederick S. King.\nMary Rosella Kormann, the daughter and one of the executors, is also dead (22nd of October, 1928). By her will, she appointed Arthur J. Holmes as her executor. The executors of Martin Roach and Mary Rosella Kormann are the respondents in this appeal.\nGeorge Roach is the only surviving child and, as will be noticed, was also the only child still living at the death of John Roach. He is the appellant in this court.\nThomas P. Hart, one of the three executors, died on the 5th of December, 1929.\nThomas Roach is the only surviving executor. He sought the interpretation of the will with reference to the following matters, namely:\n\u201c(a) To determine what interest, if any, the estate of Martin Roach and the estate of Mary Rosella Kormann take with George Roach under the said Will.\n\u201c(b) If the estates of Martin Roach and Mary Rosella Kormann share in the Estate of the said Cecilia Roach to determine the discretion that may be exercised by the surviving executor in dividing the balance of the estate among the estates of Martin Roach and Mary Rosella Kormann and George Roach.\u201d\nLogie, J., in the Supreme Court of Ontario, considered that\nthe two sons Martin and George and the daughter Mary Rosella took upon the death of the testatrix vested interests (subject to the apportionment of Thomas and Mary Rosella) in whatever portion of the estate of Cecelia was not used on behalf of John, but the enjoyment thereof was postponed until after the death of John.\nHe further considered that the power of apportionment was a bare power and not a trust and * * * the power (was) not exercisable by the survivor\nof the two persons in whom it was vested.\nAccordingly, upon the principle that \u201cequality is equity\u201d he directed that the balance of the estate should be divided equally among George Roach and the representatives of Martin Roach and Mary Rosella Kormann[3].\nThat judgment was unanimously confirmed by the Appellate Division[4].\nOn this appeal, the surviving executor is maintaining merely his application for advice and directions.\nOur first duty is to determine what interest, if any, the estates of the deceased children take with George Roach, the surviving child.\nWe agree with the courts below that Martin Roach and Mary Rosella Kormann took vested interests immediately upon the death of the testatrix.\nThe controlling words, in the will, are found in the third sentence:\nI Give, Devise, and Bequeath all my Real and Personal Estate which I may die possessed of or interested in, in the manner following, that is to say:\nThose are the only words of gift. All the other clauses are directions subordinated to these introductory words. They are words of present gift, under which Martin Roach, George Roach and Mary Rosella Kormann immediately became entitled to a share in \u201cthe entire balance of the estate\u201d. There is a prior gift, but it is only for the maintenance of John Roach, \u201cso long as he lives\u201d. The \u201cremaining\u201d or other children took the beneficial ownership in the contingent corpus, that is: in \u201cwhatever portion of (the) estate is not used in behalf of * * * John Roach, M.D., as herebefore directed\u201d (i.e., for his maintenance). On account of the position of the property, because of the prior gift for life, the division was postponed, but the gift in remainder vested at once (Theobald on Wills, 8th ed., p. 656). What was \u201cnot used in behalf of John Roach\u201d is precisely what the executors now have on hand. The beneficial interest in that contingent corpus vested, upon the death of the testatrix, in the named chil- dren and not only in such of them as would survive their brother John. The personal representatives of those who died in the lifetime of John are entitled to the property (Williams on Executors, 11th ed., p. 800), subject to the power of apportionment now remaining to be discussed.\nThe scheme devised by the testatrix is that the entire estate is to be held in trust by the three executors, first to provide maintenance for John Roach, and \u201cthen to be divided among (the) remaining sons and daughter\u201d, and the division is to be \u201cas follows\u201d: $1,000 to Thomas Roach, $1,000 to William J. Roach, and\nthen the entire balance of the Estate is to be divided among the remaining two sons Martin Roach and George Roach and my daughter Mary Rosella Kormann as in the judgment of my son Thomas and my daughter Mary Rosella deem wise, fit and proper to divide and apportion the Estate.\nThe first point to be noticed in the disposition thus made by the testatrix is that the power to divide is not given to the executors and trustees. There are three executors and trustees. The power is given nominatim to Thomas Roach and Mary Rosella Kormann. They are, in fact, two of the trustees, but the power is not conferred on them as such; and the elimination of the third executor, from among those who are to exercise the power, indicates the intention of the testatrix that the power should not be considered annexed to the office.\nThen, the fair construction of the will is that the testatrix intended to make provision for all her children, each of whom is clearly indicated by name. They take through the trustees who hold for them and not through the named persons who are given the power. It is not a power to select or to appoint; it is a power to divide and apportion. A discretion is left to Thomas Roach and to Mary Rosella to use their \u201cjudgment\u201d, but it is a discretion only\u2014which they may or may not exercise\u2014and, under the terms of the will, the children take even if the named persons do not execute the power. It follows that the gift is not subordinate to the exercise of the power and, therefore, that there was not, on the part of the testatrix, an intention of making the exercise of the power a duty. The power is not a trust nor in the nature of a trust; and nobody could complain of a breach of trust if it were not exercised. See In re Mills. Mills v. Lawrence[5]. It being so, this is not a case where s. 25 of The Trustee Act (c. 150 of R.S.O. 1927) applies. It is a case of a bare power given to two persons by name, it is \u201ca joint confidence\u201d, and it cannot be executed by the survivor. (Farwell on Powers, 3rd ed., p. 514). The result is that, Mary Rosella Kormann having died, the surviving donee of the power (Thos. Roach) can no longer exercise the discretion.\nOur opinion on the matters submitted is therefore in accord with that of the Supreme Court of Ontario and of the Appellate Division. It is not necessary to say anything further to dispose of the appeal, which should be dismissed with costs. Both courts, however, expressed the view that, as a consequence of the failure of the power, the residue of the estate must be divided equally between the appellant and the estates respectively represented by the respondents Holmes, Fanny King Roach and F.S. King. We have no doubt that, the power being now impossible of execution, a trust results in favour of all the persons in whose favour the power would have been exercisable and they take the property in equal shares.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Foy, Knox, Monahan & Keogh.\nSolicitor for the respondent Thomas Roach: Fred. C. MacDonald.\nSolicitor for the respondent, Estate of Mary Rosella Kormann, deceased: A.J.

It had the right to take expropriation proceedings in accordance with the provisions of its charter (Q.) 18 Geo. V, c. 111, s. 32. The expropriation proceedings had to be brought before the Quebec Public Service Commission, according to the provisions of the Quebec Railway Act (1925) R.S.Q., c. 230. In conformity with that Act, the appellant gave to the respondent a notice containing an offer for the value of the land taken amounting to $541.10, which offer was refused by the respondent who claimed $15,000, representing the value of the land and the damages suffered as a result of the expropriation.\nLs.

V, art. 32), et comme cons\u00e9quence de la loi du r\u00e9gime des eaux courantes de la province de Qu\u00e9bec (art. 22 et suiv. du chapitre 46, S.R.Q. 1925), \u013eexpropriation devait se faire conform\u00e9ment aux prescriptions de la loi des chemins de fer de Qu\u00e9bec (c. 230 des Statuts Refondus de Qu\u00e9bec, 1925). La Commission des Services Publics de Qu\u00e9bec, charg\u00e9e de d\u00e9cider de \u013eindemnit\u00e9 qui devait \u00eatre pay\u00e9e \u00e0 \u013eintim\u00e9, a rendu une ordonnance fixant la somme \u00e0 $3,367.60.\nIl est admis que, dans cette somme, le montant de $367.60 repr\u00e9sente la valeur du terrain expropri\u00e9; et cette partie de la sentence arbitrale n\u2019est pas attaqu\u00e9e. Mais la balance de l\u2019adjudication, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la somme de $3,000, a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par la commission pour \u201cla d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation subie\u201d par le reste du terrain \u00e0 raison du fait que ce dernier aurait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de s\u2019adapter \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019un champ d\u2019aviation et que, par suite de la construction de la ligne de transmission, son utilisation pour cette fin est devenue impossible.\nLa preuve faite devant la commission charg\u00e9e de l\u2019arbitrage a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 les faits qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, sauf que le terrain de l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisamment grand et que, pour les besoins d\u2019une exploitation de ce genre, il fallait y adjoindre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 voisine, qui n\u2019appartient pas \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9. L\u2019appelante a admis que cela ne modifiait pas le c\u00f4t\u00e9 l\u00e9gal de la question et laisse aux arbitres le droit d\u2019appr\u00e9cier la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019adaptation du terrain (Lukis v.

Cette d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation serait la m\u00eame si la ligne de transmission passait sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 voisine sans traverser le terrain de \u013eintim\u00e9. Elle n\u2019est donc pas la cons\u00e9quence de l\u2019usage qui va \u00eatre fait du terrain expropri\u00e9, suivant les exigences du statut (s. 107 du chapitre 230 S.R.Q. 1925); mais elle est le r\u00e9sultat de la mise \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019ensemble du projet de la compagnie appelante; et, en pareil cas, les arbitres ne devraient pas \u201cporter en compte\u201d le pr\u00e9tendu pr\u00e9judice.\nNous sommes d\u2019avis que ce moyen d\u2019appel n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9.\nIl est admis que, sur ce point, les l\u00e9gislations anglaise et canadienne sont semblables en substance. La proposition nous para\u00eet d\u00e9sormais solidement \u00e9tablie en Angleterre: L\u2019arbitre, en d\u00e9cidant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 payer, peut avoir \u00e9gard, non-seulement \u00e0 la valeur de la partie du terrain qui est expropri\u00e9e, mais \u00e9galement au pr\u00e9judice qui sera \u00e9prouv\u00e9 par le propri\u00e9taire sur toute la balance de son terrain. Le fait de l\u2019expropriation a pour r\u00e9sultat de saisir l\u2019arbitre de la question; et, d\u00e8s lors, il a la comp\u00e9tence n\u00e9cessaire pour se prononcer \u00e0 la fois sur la valeur du terrain pris et sur la perte caus\u00e9e au reste du terrain par suite de la mise \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution du projet de la compagnie expropriante. Le propri\u00e9taire d\u2019un terrain voisin peut, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 un certain point, \u00e9prouver les m\u00eames inconv\u00e9nients; mais cette question n\u2019est pas du domaine de l\u2019expropriation et elle rel\u00e8ve des tribunaux civils.\nLe principe est pos\u00e9 tr\u00e8s clairement dans la cause de In re Stockport, Timperley & Altringham Ry. Co.[3] et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9, avec la distinction qu\u2019il comporte, par la Chambre des Lords dans les causes de Duke of Buccleuch v. Metropolitan Board oj Works[4], et de Cowper Essex v. Acton Local Board[5]. La jurisprudence anglaise peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme r\u00e9sum\u00e9e dans ce passage de Halsbury, Laws of England, vol. 6, p. 41:\nAn owner is also entitled to compensation for the damage caused to his remaining land in respect of the use to which the land taken from him is to be put, in addition to that caused merely by the construction of the undertaking. In this respect the compensation to be awarded differs from that to which a person is entitled for injurious affection of his land when no land is taken from him. D\u00e8s 1893, dans la cause de Wood v. Atlantic & North West Railway[6], la Cour du Banc de la Reine de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, dans un jugement tr\u00e8s \u00e9labor\u00e9 o\u00f9 tous les arr\u00eats de la jurisprudence anglaise sont pass\u00e9s en revue, a adopt\u00e9 le principe qu\u2019elle contient et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il devait s\u2019appliquer dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec aux expropriations r\u00e9gies par une l\u00e9gislation conforme \u00e0 celle de l\u2019Angleterre. Le jug\u00e9 suivant r\u00e9sume bien la port\u00e9e de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour du Banc de la Reine:\nUnder the Canadian Railway Act of 1888, as well as under the English Railway Acts, a railway company is responsible, where land or real rights are or have been actually expropriated, to compensate the proprietor, not only for the land actually taken, but for the direct damage to his remaining land, resulting either from construction and severance, or from the use of the railway line and the operation of the traffic service.\nLe Conseil Priv\u00e9[7], devant qui cette cause fut port\u00e9e, n\u2019eut pas \u00e0 se prononcer sur la question, parce qu\u2019elle ne lui fut pas soumise. Dans le jugement prononc\u00e9 par Lord Shand, on constate que \u201cthe decision on these points has been acquiesced in\u201d (p. 258). Mais, dans la cause de Sisters of Charity of Rockingham v. The King[8], venue en appel de la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, le Conseil Priv\u00e9 a appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 une esp\u00e8ce semblable les d\u00e9cisions de la Chambre des Lords dans les causes de Stockport[9]; Duke of Buccleuch[10] et Cowper Essex[11]; en leur donnant la port\u00e9e que nous indiquons plus haut. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une question in pari matena, et il n\u2019y a pas de raison pour que le pr\u00e9sent appel ne soit pas d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame sens.\nL\u2019appel doit donc \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taschereau, Parent, Taschereau & Cannon.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Fernand Choquette.\n[1] [1931] Q.R. 50 \u041a.B. 381.\n[2] [1909] I K.B. 16\n[3] [1804] 33 L J.

V, c. 83 (Dom.); Railway Act, 1919, c. 68 (Dom.)\u2014Quantum of compensation awarded.\nThe respondent company was empowered by its incorporating Act, 17 Geo. V, c. 83 (Dom.), to construct a tunnel under the Detroit river, and for that purpose proceeded to expropriate a \u201cparallelopipedon\u201d or core of earth running through and forming part of appellants\u2019 land, of a uniform depth or thickness of 33\u00bd feet and at depths from ground surface to top of portion taken of about 38 to 34 feet. The said Act provided that \u201cthe Company may expropriate and take any lands actually required for the construction * * * or may expropriate and take an easement in, over, under or through such lands without the necessity of acquiring a title in fee simple thereto * * * and all the provisions of The Railway Act, 1919, applicable to such taking and acquisition, shall apply as if they were included in this Act * * * The Railway Act, 1919, shall, so far as is not inconsistent with the special provisions of this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, apply to the Company and to its works and undertakings and wherever in The Railway Act, 1919, the word \u201crailway\u201d occurs, it shall, for the purposes of the Company, mean the subways and tunnels authorized by this Act.\u201d The present appeal was from the judgment of the Appellate Division, Ont., 65 Ont. L.R. 398, dismissing the appellants\u2019 appeal from the award of compensation to them, made by Coughlin, Co. C.J., as arbitrator.\nHeld: (1) Respondent had power to expropriate (as it purported to do) a part only of the subsoil, without also expropriating all the soil and the building above it. The said incorporating Act, also the Railway Act, ss. 2 (16), 215 (par. a); Hill v. Midland Ry. Co., 21 Ch. D. 143; Metropolitan Ry. Co. v. Fowler, [1893] A.C. 416, at 425, referred to. No rule to a contrary effect, based upon the dictum in Farmer v. Waterloo & City Ry. Co., [1895] 1 Ch. 527, at 531, was applicable in this case.\n(2) Upon the evidence, the amount awarded to appellants by the arbitrator should not be disturbed.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, Ont. (supra) affirmed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] dismissing the present appellants\u2019 appeal from the award made by Coughlin, Co. C.J., as arbitrator, for compensation to them for that part of their land expropriated by the respondent for the construction of a tunnel between the city of Windsor, Ontario, and the city of Detroit, Michigan, and for damages resulting therefrom to the remainder of the land. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Cannon J. now reported. The appeal was dismissed with costs.\nR.S. Robertson, K.C., and W.D. Roach for the appellants.\nH.H. Davis, K.C., and J.B. Aylesworth for the respondent.\nDUFF, J.\u2014The statute of the respondents, in my opinion, empowers them to \u201cexpropriate and take\u201d any lands required for the authorized purposes under a title in fee simple or any \u201ceasement\u201d required for such purposes.\nThe pertinent words are:\nThe Company may (a) expropriate and take any lands actually required for the construction, maintenance and operation of the subways or tunnels authorized by this Act.\nLand, as a physical object, may, of course, have boundaries horizontal as well as vertical, curvilinear as well as rectilinear.\nI can discover nothing in the statute prescribing the manner in which the lands to be taken are to be bounded; nor anything which says that the company, \u201cactually\u201d requiring a particular piece of land, is under a legal obligation, for the purpose of expropriating it, to \u201cexpropriate and take\u201d a much larger piece of land (which is not \u201cactually required\u201d), in order to extend its domain ab centro usque ad coelum. Such a result could only be reached by adding words which are not found in the enactment. As to the supposed rule of construction based upon a dictum of Kekewich J. in Farmer v. Waterloo & City Ry. Co.[2], I prefer not to discuss that dictum in the abstract, although at present I see no reason to differ from what Masten, J.A., says about it[3]. In construing the statute before us, we are bound to take into account the character of the authorized works and the nature of the powers reasonably necessary for the prosecution of such an undertaking according to the usual methods. In view of these considerations, there is no room for the application of such a rule.\nThe land owner\u2019s protection lies in his right to compensation for severance.\nOn the questions of fact involved, the conclusions of the Appellate Division[4] seem to me to be well founded.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nNEWCOMBE, J.\u2014I agree, for the reasons stated by my brothers Duff and Cannon, that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRINFRET and LAMONT JJ. concurred with Cannon J.\nCANNON, J.\u2014This appeal is asserted from the judgment of the Second Division of the Appellate Court of the Supreme Court of Ontario4, which dismissed with costs the appeal of the appellants from the award of His Honour Judge Coughlin, Judge of the County Court of the County of Essex, fixing at the sum of $5,160, with costs, the compensation for that part of the appellants\u2019 land expropriated by the respondent for the construction of a tunnel between the city of Windsor, in the province of Ontario, and the city of Detroit, in the state of Michigan, and for damages resulting therefrom to the remainder of the land.\nBy a notice of expropriation, the respondent notified the appellants that it required for the construction of its tunnel, and offered $5,000 as compensation for, the following land:\nAll and singular that certain parcel or tract of land and premises, situate, lying and being in the City of Windsor, in the County of Essex and Province of Ontario, being composed of part of Lot number 4, according to Registered Plan No. 91. The part to be taken is of a uniform depth or thickness of thirty-three feet six inches (33\u2019 6\u201d) measured vertically, the upper face of which is thirty-eight feet ten inches (38\u2019 10\u201d) below the top of the sidewalk at the south limit of Sandwich street, and rises with a uniform grade of 3.97%, going southerly from Sandwich street.\nThe vertical projection of the above described parcel, at the surface of the ground, was also specified.\nThe offer having been refused, an arbitration became necessary to fix the compensation to which the appellants were entitled for the expropriation of what has been called a \u201cparallelopipedon\u201d or core of earth running through and forming part of the appellants\u2019 land at a depth from the surface of the ground to the top of the portion taken of some 38 feet at the northerly boundary of the appellants\u2019 land and sloping upwards at a uniform grade to a depth of about 34 feet from the surface at the southerly boundary thereof.\nThe arbitrator applied the word \u201ceasement\u201d to the section of land expropriated from appellants and mentioned that the surface area of the land above the easement is 2,101 square feet; and the learned County Judge then proceeds:\nIn the presentation of the Kolodzi claim the factors contributing to the claim for compensation were separated into two divisions, namely, First: Compensation for prospective damages to the building at present upon the Kolodzi land by the construction and operation of the tunnel; and second: Compensation for the taking of the easement and for all damages resulting therefrom or from the construction or operation of the tunnel exclusive of the damages included in the first division. With respect to both divisions I have not taken into account damages which might be caused through the negligence of the Company or its servants or agents as such damages if suffered by the Claimant would be recoverable by suit against the Company.\nWith reference to the first division I find that the building on the Kolodzi lands is a three storey brick building upwards of forty years old, in fair condition, and now used as a hotel. I accept Mr. Page\u2019s valuation of the building\u2014approximately $17,000 as being a correct valuation.\nThe expert evidence as to the effect of the construction of the proposed tunnel on this building varies very widely,\u2014from a 50-50 chance of complete ruin on the one side to an almost complete absence of any risk of damage on the other. It seems foolish to have to now make a finding on widely divergent expressions of opinion with respect to a matter which in a few months\u2019 time will be absolutely determined by facts then existing. But as no agreement has been come to by the parties to so wait, I must proceed to determine the matter on the evidence produced before me. I am of opinion that in the absence of negligence on the part of the Subway Company, its servants or agents, there is practically no risk of the collapse of the Kolodzi building. There is, in my opinion, a likelihood of some damage occurring and a possibility, not a probability, that some at present unforeseen contingency may, without any negligence on the part of the Company, result in substantial damage to the building. I think it is fair to conclude that a prospective purchaser would reduce the price he would otherwise be prepared to pay for the building by 20% of its value as ascertained above, namely, $3,400.\nWith reference to the second division above mentioned it has been urged that the existence of such an easement as that taken, even though no immediate damage should be suffered and though no future damage could be definitely predicted, has an immediate depressing effect with respect to the price obtainable for the land subject to the easement. I am satisfied that this contention is entitled to some consideration. It is urged that if the tunnel were not there there would be a prospect that the land would some day be used as a site for an office building or some other high structure. On this last mentioned point I am satisfied on the evidence given that within a few years at the most, when whatever subsidence may result from the construction of the tunnel has terminated, a ten storey building may be erected with the same safety and cost as if the tunnel were not there. The inability to build a still higher structure would in my opinion diminish the present value of the property to but a very slight degree.\nTaking the sum of all possibilities which might operate to produce a psychological effect on the mind of an intending purchaser in reducing the price he would otherwise pay, I place the compensation with respect to all the elements referred to in the second division at 10% of the value of the land exclusive of the buildings.\nI find the value of the land alone to be $17,600, making the compensation under this head $1,760.\nAdding the above amounts of $3,400 and $1,760 together makes a total of $5,160 which sum I award the claimants Kolodzi and I direct that the costs of the arbitration be paid by the Company.\nIn arriving at the above amounts I have paid some attention to the offers made by the Company or by persons acting in their interest as some evidence of the psychological effect of the easement and of the prospect of damages on the market value of the servient property.\nThe appellants served a notice of appeal from the award in which they set forward the following grounds:\n1. That the learned Judge, as Arbitrator, erred in finding that the value of the Claimants\u2019 land would be depreciated by reason of the easement in favour of the Respondent by only ten (10) per cent. of the value of the land, exclusive of the building.\n2. That the amount awarded by the learned Judge, as Arbitrator, for damages for depreciation by reason of the presence of the easement as aforesaid, is an arbitrary sum not supported by the evidence and that, upon the evidence, the learned Arbitrator should have found that such depreciation will be greatly in excess of the amount awarded.\n3. That the learned Judge, as Arbitrator, having found as a fact that there is a likelihood that the construction of the tunnel by the Respondent through the Claimants\u2019 land below the building thereon will cause some damage, and that there is a possibility of substantial damage to the building being caused thereby, erred in concluding, as a result of such finding, that the damage to the claimants by reason thereof is only twenty (20) per cent. of the value of the building, and that having made that finding of fact he should have awarded the Claimants a sum approximating the total value of the building.\n4. And upon such further grounds as may be alleged by Counsel on the hearing of the appeal. We concur with the Court of Appeal[5], and especially with the reasons of Honourable Justice Masten that, upon the evidence, the quantum of the allowance could not effectively be attacked. The reasons of the arbitrator appear to be entirely satisfactory and the evidence would not warrant any disturbance of the amount of the award. The appellants, while retaining the ownership of the building, are claiming 100% of its value, as prospective damages.\nCounsel for the appellants, however, here and before the Court of Appeal, raised a point not covered by the notice of appeal and argued that the Special Act under which the respondent derived its power of expropriation did not permit it to expropriate any part of the substratum; but it was bound to take the whole of the land, from the centre of the earth to the sky and that consequently the whole proceedings were vitiated ab initio and the award invalid.\nAlthough the Court of Appeal might have disposed of this point by refusing to entertain it, the parties were, however, heard upon it and Mr. Justice Riddell accepted the appellants\u2019 view in his dissenting judgment. We must therefore give due consideration to this phase of the appeal. With all respect for the dissenting opinion, we believe that the question must be determined by referring to our own Railway Act and the Special Act incorporating the company, 17 Geo. V, c. 83, which reads as follows, in part:\nWhereas a petition has been presented praying for the incorporation of a company to construct and operate subways or tunnels for vehicular, pedestrian, railway and other purposes, beneath the bed of the Detroit river from the city of Windsor, the town of Sandwich and the town of Walkerville to the city of Detroit as hereinafter set forth, and it is expedient to grant the prayer of the said petition: Therefore His Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as follows:\n* * *\n12. The Company may,\u2014(a) lay out, construct, complete, maintain, work, manage and use subways or tunnels under the Detroit river, for vehicular, pedestrian, railway and other purposes, with the necessary approaches from convenient points on the Canadian side in or near the city of Windsor, the town of Sandwich and the town of Walkerville, to points in or near the city of Detroit, in the state of Michigan, one of the United States of America;\n(b) construct, maintain and operate elevators, lifts, escalators, and other means of ingress to and egress from the said subways or tunnels;\n* * *\n15. The Company may,\u2014(a) expropriate and take any lands actually required for the construction, maintenance and operation of the subways or tunnels authorized by this Act, or may expropriate and take an easement in, over, under or through such lands without the necessity of acquiring a title in fee simple thereto, after the plan of such lands has been approved by the Governor in Council; and all the provisions of; The Railway Act, 1919, applicable to such talking and acquisition, shall apply as if they were included in this Act; and all the provisions of The Railway Act, 1919, which are applicable, shall in like manner apply to the ascertainment and the payment of the compensation for or damages to land arising out of such taking and acquisition, or the construction or maintenance of the works of the Company;\n* * *\n21. The Railway Act, 1919, shall, so far as is not inconsistent with the special provisions of this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, apply to the Company and to its works and undertakings and wherever in The Railway Act, 1919, the word \u201crailway\u201d occurs, it shall, for the purposes of the Company, mean the subways and tunnels authorized by this Act.\nClause 2 of the Railway Act, R.S.C., 1927, chapter 170, is also relevant:\n2. In this Act, and in any Special Act as hereinafter defined, in so far as this Act applies, unless the context otherwise requires,\n(15) \u201clands\u201d means the lands, the acquiring, taking or using of which is authorized by this or the Special Act, and includes real property, messuages, lands, tenements and hereditaments of any tenure, and any easement, servitude, right, privilege or interest in, to, upon, under, over or in respect of the same.\nThe words from \u201cand any easement\u201d to the end of the subsection were added by chapter 68 of the statutes of 1919, section 2, and introduced a radical change in the nature and extent of a railway company\u2019s right of expropriation. The right to expropriate a mere easement was then given expressly for the first time. Therefore, it would appear that the Railway Act, as amended, would have justified, without the special powers given by its Act of incorporation, the taking of that part of the appellants\u2019 lands actually required for the passage of the tunnel. Section 215, paragraph (a) of the same Railway Act confirms our view, when it directs that the notice of expropriation to be served shall contain either a description of the land to be taken or of the power to be exercised with regard to any land therein described.\nWe believe that the respondent had power to expropriate a part only of the sub-soil without also expropriating all the soil and building above it.\nThe learned arbitrator gave the name of easement to the acquisition in fee simple of the parallelopipedon (i.e., a prism whose six faces are parallelograms) beneath the surface of defendants\u2019 land. The company is clearly author- ized by section 15 of its charter to expropriate and take an easement in, over, under, or through any land, provided that portion is actually required for the construction, maintenance and operation of its tunnel. The easement of tunnelling seems to have been recognized in England as early as 1882 in Hill v. Midland Railway Company[6], where the heading mentions the \u201ceasement of tunnelling under land\u201d; Fry, J., in referring to plaintiffs argument, uses the word \u201ceasement\u201d to describe the \u201cright to construct a tunnel\u201d and finds that the word \u201clands\u201d in the English Lands Clauses Act \u201cis declared to extend to tenements and hereditaments of any tenure\u201d and asks himself \u201cwhether this easement, or the right to construct this tunnel, is or is not a hereditament.\u201d \u201cIt is a right to enter upon the land to construct a tunnel, and to enjoy and use that land for particular purposes\u201d; and the learned justice added what may be applied to this case mutatis mutandis:\nBut then it is said (and said with perfect truth) that there are decisions which shew that generally easements are not included within the word \u201clands\u201d in the 85th section (of the English Lands Clauses Act). But why are they not included? Not because they are not hereditaments within the meaning of the 85th section, but simply because there is usually no power to take an easement. That is the defect in the ordinary scheme of legislation with regard to railways which prevents easements coming within the scope of the definition of the word \u201clands\u201d.\nThis defect, in this case, has been remedied by this new subsection 15 of clause 2 of our Railway Act and the charter of the respondents.\nThe respondents were authorized to expropriate and use a portion of the subsoil for the construction of their tunnel; and we say, paraphrasing Lord Watson, in Metroplitan Railway Company v. Fowler [7], that the nature of the Company\u2019s power depends upon the provisions of the Act authorizing their undertaking. As matters stand, the owners of the soil (the appellants) are practically divested of interest in that part of it which has been converted into a tunnel. They have no right to occupy it and their exclusion is not for a limited period but for all time coming. To expropriate means to appropriate compulsorily, i.e., to take and keep a thing by exclusive right; and, we consider, under the Act, the authority conferred upon the company is to take and exclusively possess as much of the sub-soil under such lands as may be actually required for the purposes of the undertaking.\nFor these reasons, and for those given in his carefully prepared judgment by Masten, J.A., we are of opinion that the notice of expropriation was well given, that the proceedings were regular and that the award should not be interfered with.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Roach, Riddell & Dore.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Bartlet, Bartlet, Barnes, Aylesworth & McGladdery.\n[1] (1930) 65 Ont.

(ibid) upholding the legislation, reversed.\nNewcombe and Cannon JJ. dissented, holding that the legislation was intra vires, in its application to the facts of the present case, and having regard to the purpose for which such legislation was invoked, namely, prevention of use of such vessels as depots for supply of intoxicating liquors to boats engaged in smuggling liquor into Canada.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1], dismissing his appeal from the judgment of Paton J.1 dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action. The case arose out of the seizure of a schooner (registered at Digby, N.S.) owned by plaintiff, with a cargo of liquor (also owned by plaintiff) on board, on June 13, 1929, by a patrol boat in the employ of the Department of National Revenue of Canada, and of which the defendant was the commander. Plaintiff brought action for the return of the vessel and cargo, or payment of their value, and damages for their detention. The defence was that the vessel had dutiable goods on board, was \u201chovering\u201d within twelve marine miles of the coast of Canada, and was liable to seizure under ss. 151 and 207 of the Customs Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 42, as amended by c. 16 of the Acts of 1928. (The material parts of these sections are set out in the judgment of Newcombe J., dissenting, now reported.)\nThe case was tried before Paton J. with a jury. It was agreed between counsel that the only question to be submitted to the jury was whether the schooner at the time she was seized was within twelve marine miles of Flat Point Lighthouse (a lighthouse at the entrance to Sydney Harbour, in the county of Cape Breton, N.S.), and that all other questions of fact were to be decided by the judge. The jury found that the schooner was three-quarters of a mile inside the said limit. Paton J. made certain findings (inter alia) as to the use and conduct of the schooner, which are quoted or stated in the judgment of Newcombe J. (dissenting) now reported, and found that the schooner when seized was \u201chovering\u201d within the meaning of that word as used in the Customs Act. It was contended on behalf of the plaintiff that the schooner and her cargo were seized upon the High Seas, and that the legislation invoked by the defendant as justifying the seizure was ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada. Paton J. held against this contention and dismissed the action[2]. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, solely on the question of the power of the Parliament of Canada to enact the legislation in question. The Court en banc held that the Parliament of Canada had such power and dismissed the appeal2. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, and, by agreement between counsel, the only question argued was as to the validity of the legislation. D. A. Cameron K.C. for the appellant.\nC. B. Smith K.C. and J. E. Read K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff and Lamont JJ. (with whose conclusion Rinfret J. also concurred) was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014The phrase \u201cpeace, order and good government\u201d is found generally in the English colonial charters, and, unless the constitution set up is federal or quasi federal, it commonly is employed to designate, as regards subject matter, the scope of the legislative authority conferred. It is an accepted principle that prima facie the jurisdiction of subordinate legislatures is territorially limited. It may be considered as axiomatic that a grant of legislative authority to a British colony for \u201cthe peace, order and good government\u201d of the colony, does not, as a general rule, empower the colonial legislature to enact laws penalizing acts, otherwise lawful, done beyond the territory of the colony, or legalizing such acts when otherwise unlawful. Broadly, it may be laid down, as a rule of construction, that subordinate legislatures do not possess such extra-territorial jurisdiction unless it has been granted in express terms or by necessary implication. The restriction is a restriction of power, and enactments framed in disregard of it not only will be ignored by foreign countries, but will be treated as pro tanto inoperative by the courts of the colony itself; in this regard differing in its effect from the restrictions imposed upon a sovereign state by international law and the competing jurisdictions of other sovereign states, which, at the command of the supreme legislative authority of the state, will be ignored by its courts.\nWhen the subject matter of a power possessed by the Crown falls within \u201cpeace, order and good government,\u201d and is consequently within the scope of a grant of legislative authority by the Imperial Parliament, then, if that power necessarily involves, in its complete enjoyment, the authority to execute extra-territorial acts of sovereignty, such as acts of constraint upon the person, this complementary authority also passes with it. Attorney-General for Canada v. Cain[3] is an application of this principle.\nI see no reason whatever to think that a general authority to detain and arrest ships extra-territorially, passes under the formula \u201cpeace, order and good government,\u201d nor do I think that the fullest enjoyment of the powers given under the heads \u201cNavigation and Shipping,\u201d \u201cTrade and Commerce,\u201d and \u201cTaxation\u201d necessitates, in the pertinent sense, the possession of such authority. As a rule, indeed, legislative authority in respect of taxation is limited strictly, in its exercise, by the territorial boundaries. Commercial Cable Company v. Attorney-General of Newfoundland[4]. I shall assume that the question, under this topic, is precisely the same as if the regulation of imports were explicitly included among the enumerated items of section 91.\nOne must emphasize here the distinction between the necessity from which a legal implication proceeds, and those considerations which merely go to establish the convenience, amounting even, in judicial opinion, to practical necessity from the political point of view, of extending a power admittedly given. The law implies the grant of all proper means necessary for the execution of the power itself as given, but that is the only necessity of which, for this purpose, the law takes notice. The courts have no authority to extend the scope of an admitted power merely because the power as given is not sufficiently comprehensive to attain an object never so important or urgent, in the judicial view. The implied power must, to use the language of the Privy Council in Cain\u2019s case3, be \u201cthe complement,\u201d in the sense just explained, of the power expressly conferred. There is no general test for determining that this condition is satisfied, but it seems, abundantly clear that no such necessity can be affirmed of the power to maintain at large on the high seas a preventive service with authority to detain British ships destined for Canadian ports, for the purpose of ascertaining: whether they carry non-admissible goods or non-admissible persons. It is nothing to the purpose that the statute applies only to ships of Canadian registry. If the argument of the Crown is sound, the statute would be equally within the scope of Canadian jurisdiction if the reference to Canadian registry were absent. Nothing in Cain\u2019s case[5] countenances such a procedure in relation to immigrants.\nThe judgment in Nadan\u2019s case[6] exemplifies the rigour which governs the courts in examining this question of necessary implication. The subject of that judgment is the ambit and effect of the item of section 91 that is concerned with criminal law and criminal procedure. By that section, Parliament is empowered to make laws \u201cin relation to\u201d these subjects; and, within the territorial bounds of its jurisdiction, these powers are subject to no limitation or qualification. \u201cBut, however widely these powers are construed, they are confined to action to be taken in the Dominion.\u201d Nadan v. The King[7].\nPlenary legislative authority, for Canada, in relation to criminal law and procedure in the entire scope of those subjects, it might have been argued, not without force, would embrace authority to declare the finality of Canadian judgments and sentences in criminal proceedings; and that for the purpose of making such declarations effective, the legislative authority must extend so far as to enable Canada to deal with the operation, in Canada, of the jurisdiction of His Majesty in Council in respect of the review of colonial judicial proceedings. But since such a review by His Majesty\u2019s order does not fall within the category of \u201caction to be taken within the Dominion,\u201d the principle of grant by necessary implication does not take effect. This is not the only ground of the judgment, but it is an independent one and of co-ordinate authority with the others.\nThere remains to consider the limitation of the enactment to ships of Canadian registry. This does not, so far as I can see, affect the matter. It may be assumed that section 735 of the Merchant Shipping Act presupposes colonial authority to establish a system of colonial registration and to prescribe conditions therefor; but I can find nothing in that section, which, by implication, creates or recognizes a general authority to regulate ships of colonial registry by requiring them to submit to such extra-territorial acts as those authorized by the legislation before us.\nThere is no occasion to consider the extent of the authority given or recognized by this section in relation to subject matters dealt with by the Merchant Shipping Act. Nor need we discuss the scope of such authority, in respect of conditions of registration, precedent or subsequent; that is not the character, in substance or in form, of the enactment with which we are concerned.\nI do not enter upon a discussion of the effect of the Colonial Laws Validity Act. It would, I think, be a new reading, and, it would seem to me, a misreading, of that statute, to construe it as imparting extra-territorial validity to the enactments of a colonial legislature professing to operate extra-territorially, where the legislature is not otherwise endowed with power to pass such legislation.\nIn my view, the legislation is ultra vires.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the action remitted to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to be disposed of in accordance with the view herein expressed.\nRinfret J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Duff that the impugned section is ultra vires and that the appeal should be allowed with costs and the action remitted to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to be disposed of in accordance with the view herein expressed.\nThe judgment of Newcombe and Cannon JJ., dissenting, was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The plaintiff, who is a master mariner, brings this action as owner of the schooner Dorothy M. Smart, registered at Digby, in Nova Scotia. The defendant is a Canadian customs officer, employed for the prevention of smuggling and the enforcement of the Customs Act, c. 42 of the R.S.C., 1927. The plaintiff alleges in his statement of claim that he \u201cwas engaged in the business of buying liquors for the purpose of sale upon the high seas,\u201d having cleared from St. Pierre Miquelon, and that his vessel was seized by the defendant while lawfully engaged in that business. We are told in the statement of case that the seizure was made at a point eleven and one-quarter miles off Flat Point light (a lighthouse at the entrance of Sydney Harbour, in Cape Breton) by a patrol boat in the employ of the Department of National Revenue of Canada, and under the defendant\u2019s command.\nThe defendant justifies the seizure under authority of s. 151 of the Customs Act, c. 42, R.S.C., 1927, as enacted by s. 1 of c. 16 of the Dominion Acts of 1928. The provisions of this section material to the case are as follows:\n151. (1) If any vessel is hovering in territorial waters of Canada, any officer may go on board such vessel and examine her cargo and may also examine the master or person in command upon oath touching the cargo and voyage and may bring the vessel into port.\n* * *\n(7) For the purposes of this section and section two hundred and seven of this Act, \u201cTerritorial waters of Canada,\u201d shall mean the waters forming part of the territory of the Dominion of Canada and the waters adjacent to the Dominion within three marine miles thereof, in the case of any vessel, and within twelve marine miles thereof, in the case of any vessel registered in Canada.\nBy s. 207, as enacted by c. 16 of 1928, it is provided that\nIf upon the examination by any officer of the cargo of any vessel hovering in territorial waters of Canada, any dutiable goods or any goods the importation of which into Canada is prohibited are found on board, such vessel with her apparel, rigging, tackle, furniture, stores and cargo shall be seized and forfeited * * *.\nThe action was tried by Paton J., of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, who found that the vessel cleared on 8th June, 1929, from St. Pierre Miquelon, for the high seas, with a cargo of assorted liquor and rum; the particular destination being a place about fifteen miles northeast of the lighthouse, and the nearest point of land to a vessel lying in that direction; that, on the night of 12th June the vessel arrived at its destination, \u201cand from that time until the next afternoon about four o\u2019clock, it was jogging about in various directions, waiting for customers to come out in boats from shore.\u201d The learned judge also found that\nThere is no doubt the intention was to remain in such proximity to the coast as would enable customers or purchasers, under the cover of darkness or fog, to smuggle the liquor into Canada. Since the adoption of prohibition in Nova Scotia, Halifax is the only entry port in Nova Scotia for alcoholic liquors, and lawful importation could not be made at North Sydney nor at Sydney.\nThe plaintiff, as owner of the schooner and cargo, and his captain must have known, and I find they did know, that any liquor that might be sold could only be to persons desiring to smuggle it into this country. The learned judge upheld the legislation and dismissed the action[8]. His judgment was unanimously affirmed by the Supreme Court en banc8; and it now comes before this Court upon the single objection that the above quoted provisions of the Customs Act are ultra vires of the parliament of Canada.\nThere is no question of international or of alien rights. The plaintiff is a British subject resident at North Sydney, in Nova Scotia; and his schooner is registered in the same province. It is not suggested that the Dominion legislation conflicts with provincial powers. The rights, such as they are, are all intra familiam. All that is conceded. But what the plaintiff seeks to justify in opposition to the Customs Act, the executive power and the preventive service of Canada, is the use of his vessel upon the outer margin of Canadian territorial waters, contiguous to his place of residence, as a depot of supply of intoxicating liquors to boats engaged in the smuggling of the liquor into the province.\nIf the defendant were a pirate prowling on the coast, or if he were, in time of war, using his vessel to supply an enemy squadron attempting to blockade the port of Sydney, is it conceivable that the powers of the parliament of Canada would be found inadequate to sanction the seizure? Parliament is specifically empowered to legislate for the regulation of trade and commerce, the raising of money by any mode or system of taxation, defence, navigation and shipping and the criminal law; also to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces; and there are, moreover, the latent powers which, as explained in Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider[9], are exercisable in cases of emergency.\nThe Hovering Acts of Great Britain have been justified in principle and practice, and the enactments now in contest exemplify provisions which are reasonable, and, it seems, necessary, for the protection of the country.\nThe Act to remove Doubts as to the Validity of Colonial Laws, c. 63 of the United Kingdom, 1865, which is described by Mr. Dicey as the charter of colonial legislative independence (Law of the Constitution, 8th ed., p. 101), enacts, by sec. 2, that\nAny Colonial Law which is or shall be in any respect repugnant to the Provisions of any Act of Parliament extending to the Colony to 1 which such Law may relate, or repugnant to any Order or Regulation made under Authority of such Act of Parliament, or having in the Colony the Force and Effect of such Act, shall be read subject to such Act, Order, or Regulation, and shall, to the Extent of such Repugnancy, but not otherwise, be and remain absolutely void and inoperative.\nThere is no repugnancy found or suggested as between the legislation upon which the Crown relies and any imperial Act, order or regulation having force or effect in Canada; and, therefore, whatever operation sees. 151 and 207 of the Canadian Customs Act may have, it would seem, according to express enactment, that they shall not \u201cbe and remain absolutely void and inoperative.\u201d\nIt is unnecessary to repeat the well known rule enunciated by Lord Selborne in The Queen v. Bur ah[10], and restated in Hodge v. The Queen[11].\nUpon the reference to this Court of the Bigamy Sections of the Criminal Code[12], the point considered was whether these sections were, by reason of their extra-territorial operation, ultra vires of the Dominion to legislate for the criminal law, and the legislation was upheld by the majority of the court; but the learned Chief Justice (Strong), although he dissented in the particular case, gave expression in his judgment to the view which, I think, is not controverted, that\nAs the Imperial Parliament is a sovereign legislature I do not for a moment dispute the proposition that it may confer upon a colonial legislature powers in this respect co-equal with its own, by granting it authority to enact the personal liability of all British subjects resident within its jurisdiction, or indeed of all British subjects generally, for crimes committed without the jurisdiction. The question to be dealt with here is not as to the power of Parliament in this respect, but as to whether such authority has actually been conferred[13].\nReferring to the general powers of the Dominion to legislate for the peace, order and good government of Canada, Lord Halsbury held in Riel v. The Queen[14], that these words \u201care apt to authorize the utmost discretion of enactment for the attainment of the objects pointed to.\u201d And by the preamble of the British North America Act, 1867, it is recited that the project is union of the provinces under the Crown, \u201cwith a constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom,\u201d and that \u201csuch a union would conduce to the welfare of the provinces and promote the interests of the British Empire.\u201d\nThe case, as submitted, does not disclose the port of departure of the plaintiff\u2019s vessel upon the voyage to St. Pierre Miquelon for the lading of the cargo in respect of which the seizure took place; but, seeing that both the plaintiff and his vessel were locally situate in Nova Scotia, it is not a violent presumption that they cleared, or at any rate went, from that province upon the voyage in question. When, therefore, a British subject resident and being in Canada sets himself up to defeat the Customs laws by contriving to evade them, to defraud the revenue and illegally to introduce into the country a prohibited commodity which has been found a menace to the national life, threatening disaster; and when the Parliament of Canada, having the powers to which I have alluded, finds a remedy in the enactments of which the appellant complains, is that not, in the words of Lord Selborne, in the case of this Dominion, constituted as it is, \u201clegislation within the general scope of the affirmative words which give the power\u201d to legislate for the peace, order and good government of Canada? Certainly, \u201cit violates no express condition or restriction by which that power is limited\u201d; and any limitation, to be effective, must, according to the rule laid down, be express. It may also be regarded as significant that, while the enumerations of provincial powers in sec. 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, are usually, or not infrequently, qualified by the words \u201cin the province,\u201d or a like restriction, there is not, in a single instance, a corresponding qualification to be found in sec. 91, which describes the powers of parliament.\nI conclude therefore that the legislation now the subject of attack is, in its application to the facts of this case, intra vires, and that this appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D.

Act, 1867, ss. 91, 92, 132.\nIn the existing state of radio science and in the light of the knowledge and use of the art as actually understood and worked, radio communication is subject to the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament. Rinfret and Lamont JJ. dissenting.\nPer Rinfret and Lamont JJ. dissenting.\u2014The Dominion Parliament has not jurisdiction to legislate on the subject of radio communication in every respect. This subject falls within the primary legislative jurisdiction of the provinces either under no. 13 (property and civil rights) or under no. 10 (local works and undertakings) of section 92 of the B.N.A. Act, except in cases where the Dominion Parliament has superseding jurisdiction under some of the heads of section 91 and under section 132 (relating to treaties) of the B.N.A. Act.\nREFERENCE by the Governor General in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration, pursuant to the authority of s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 35.\nThe facts and questions, as stated in the Order in Council, are as follows:\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 17th February, 1931, from the Minister of Justice, submitting that His Majesty\u2019s Government of the province of Quebec has questioned the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada to regulate and control radio communication and has submitted questions to the Court of King\u2019s Bench (in appeal) of the province, whether the Radiotelegraph Act (R.S.C., 1927, chapter 195) in whole or in part, is within the jurisdiction of the Dominion to enact and whether a certain legislative scheme projected by the said Government of the Province for the regulation and control of certain radio communication, is within the jurisdiction of the Legislature of the Province to enact.\nThe Minister apprehends that the Radiotelegraph Act and Regulations made thereunder were enacted by reason of the expediency of making provision for the regulation of a service essentially important in itself as touching closely the national life and interest.\nThe Minister reports that on the 25th day of November, 1927, an international radiotelegraph convention was signed by the representatives of about eighty countries including the Dominion of Canada. The said convention was ratified by the Government of Canada and the instrument of ratification deposited pursuant to the convention at Washington on the 29th day of October, 1928. The convention went into effect on January 1, 1929. Legislation exists and is necessary to make provision for performing the obligations of Canada under the said convention. The Minister further reports that a treaty which came into force on the 1st March, 1929, was effected by the exchange of notes between the United States, Canada, Cuba and Newfoundland relative to the division between the countries of channels of communication in that part of the spectrum represented by the range of frequencies from 1,500 kilocycles to 6,000 kilocycles.\nThe Minister further reports that negotiations have taken place between Canada and the United States with the object of dividing between the two countries the total number of channels (96) which exist in that part of the spectrum represented by frequencies of 550 kilocycles to 1,500 kilocycles, appropriated by the International Convention hereinbefore mentioned, to the service of broadcasting. No agreement has as yet been made, but at present Canada is making use of 17 channels of which 6 are being used exclusively by Canada and of which 11 are being used by both countries.\nThe Minister further reports that an informal arrangement was made in 1930 between Canada and the United States with reference to the use of radiotelegraphy by aircraft passing between the two countries.\nThe Minister further reports that on the 31st May, 1929, a treaty was entered into between the principal maritime nations of the world relating to the safety of life at sea. Provision was made for the compulsory fitting of wireless apparatus on board certain classes of vessels.\nThe Minister further reports that at the Imperial Conference 1930, a committee was set up to consider questions relating to imperial communications other than transport, which committee considered a scheme for the establishment of an empire broadcasting service and considered questions relating to the establishment of telephone and telegraph services for the broadcasting of weather maps.\nIn December, 1928, the Government appointed a royal commission on radio broadcasting to examine into the broadcasting situation in the Dominion of Canada and to make representations to the Government as to the future administration, management, control and financing thereof. On the 11th September, 1929, the said royal commission reported.\nThe Minister further reports that radio provides for various forms of communication which may be classified as follows:\u2014\n(a) Radiotelegraph, which provides for the transmission of intelligence on the Morse telegraphic code;\n(b) Radiotelephone, which provides for the transmission of spoken word, music and sounds of all kinds;\n(c) Facsimile, which provides for the transmission of photographs, pictures, printed matter, handwriting, etc., in such a manner that they are reproduced in like form at point of reception;\n(d) Television, which provides for the transmission of pictures of moving objects.\nThe Minister further reports that radio is used in Canada for the following purposes:\u2014\n(a) Coast stations are established to provide radio facilities whereby any ship within 500 miles of the Canadian coast can establish instant contact with the shore. Constant watch, 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, is maintained at practically all of the stations. The coast stations consist of three chains, one extending from Vancouver to Prince Rupert on the Pacific coast, another from Port Arthur at the head of the Great Lakes to Newfoundland and Labrador, and the third from Port Churchill to the eastern entrance to Hudson Straits. The 60 stations forming this system are owned by the Department of Marine. Of these, 41 are operated by the department itself while -the remaining 19 are operated by the Canadian Marconi Company under contract.\nIn addition a long distance station owned and operated by the Canadian Marconi Company is maintained at Louisburg, N.S., for communication with ships at long range. This station can maintain communication with ships at a distance of 2,000 miles.\n(b) Direction finding stations to the number of 17 are owned and operated by the Department of Marine on the Atlantic coast. There are 4 on Hudson Bay and Strait and one on the West coast. These stations give bearings upon request to any ship.\n(c) Radio beacons to the number of 17 are owned and operated by the Department of Marine. There are 9 on the East coast, 5 on the Great Lakes and 3 on the West coast. Any ship fitted with direction finding apparatus can take her own bearings from stations of this class which transmit signals automatically once every hour day or night and continuously during foggy weather.\n(d) Radiotelephone stations to the number of 8 are owned and operated by the Department of Marine on the Pacific coast for communication with small craft and for life saving purposes.\n(e) Special services including weather forecasts, storm warnings and time signals are also transmitted by the above mentioned stations for the benefit of ships at sea.\n(\u0192) Ship Stations. There are 319 ships of Canadian registry fitted with radio apparatus. The Radiotelegraph Act calls for the compulsory fitting of certain passenger vessels with such apparatus.\n(g) Public commercial stations to the number of 46 are licensed, although 9 only are as yet established for operation.. These are designed for handling paid traffic between fixed points. The principal ones in operation are those operated by the Canadian Marconi Company for communication with New York, England and Australia.\n(h) Private commercial stations to the number of 131 are licensed. These are established for communication with isolated points not reached by telegraph or telephone.\n(i) Experimental and amateur experimental stations to the number of 700 are licensed.\n(j) The Department of National Defence maintains 104 stations and in addition operates 10 stations in the Northwest Territories on behalf of the Department of the Interior. It also operates 21 stations for airmail and forestry and has 20 aircraft fitted with radio.\n(k) Broadcasting stations to the number of 67 physical stations are licensed in Canada having power rating from 50 to 5,000 watts. Owing to the limited number of frequencies or channels available for broadcasting in Canada (6 exclusive and 11 shared with the United States out of a total of 96 as explained above) 2 or 3 stations in the same centre may be required to share time and frequency. In assigning a channel to any station, the matter of geographical separation and power employed have to be considered. It is the practice, for example, not to assign the same frequency or channel to two 50 watt stations which are less than 200 miles apart or to two 500 watt stations which are less than 1,800 miles apart. (l) Receiving sets to the number of 472,531 were licensed by the Dominion in -the nine months ending December 31, 1930.\nThe Minister further reports that the Department of Marine maintains a service to detect and investigate interference with reception throughout Canada. Furthermore inspectors are maintained throughout Canada to administer and enforce the Radiotelegraph Act and Regulations with regard to compulsory equipment of ships, the licensing of stations and the inspection of stations to see \u2018that they maintain the frequency or channel assigned to them in order that interference may not occur.\nThe Minister further reports that operators\u2019 certificates of proficiency issued by the Minister of Marine are, under reciprocal arrangement with Great Britain and the other dominions and colonies, accepted.\nThe Minister further reports that during the fiscal year 1929-30 the prosecution of 1,267 persons in various parts of Canada for operating receiving sets without licence was undertaken. In two cases, one at Regina and another at Summerside, where adverse decisions were rendered against the Department on the ground that the statute did not in terms apply to receiving sets, the decisions were appealed and the contention of the department upheld.\nThe Minister further reports that the revenue collected for licence fees in the fiscal year 1929-30 was $449,010.40 and for 1930-31 (9 months) the revenue was $479,48820.\nThe Minister further reports that, as the use of Hertzian waves for transmission and reception of communications is a development of recent years, he has had prepared by Mr. J. W. Bain, radio engineer, Department of Marine, a memorandum of explanation of the principles underlying radio communication, which memorandum is annexed hereto.\nThe Minister recommends, in view of the fact that the jurisdiction of Parliament has been questioned, that the opinion of the highest judicial authority in Canada be obtained with the least possible delay and that, with this in view, the following questions be referred to \u2018the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration pursuant to the authority of section 55 of the Supreme Court Act:\u2014\n1. Has the Parliament of Canada jurisdiction to regulate and control radio communication, including the transmission and reception of signs, signals, pictures and sounds of all kinds by means of Hertzian waves, and including the right to determine the character, use and location of apparatus employed?\n2. If not, in what particular or particulars or to what extent is the jurisdiction of Parliament limited?\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing, and advise that the said questions be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration, accordingly.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and J. L. St. Jacques K.C., for the Attorney-General of Canada.\nCharles Lanct\u00f4t K.C. and Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the Attorney-General of Quebec.\nJoseph Sedgwick for the Attorney-General for Ontario.\nF. H. Chrysler K.C. for the Attorneys-General for Manitoba and Saskatchewan. R. B. Hanson K.C. for the Attorney-General for New Brunswick.\nBrooke Claxton for the Canadian Radio League.\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014The Governor General in Council, under the authority of section 55 of the Supreme Court Act, has referred to this court the following questions:\n1. Has the Parliament of Canada jurisdiction to regulate and control radio communication, including the transmission and reception of signs, signals, pictures and sounds of all kinds by means of Hertzian waves, and including the right to determine the character, use and location of apparatus employed?\n2. If not, in what particular or particulars or to what extent is the jurisdiction of Parliament limited?\nPersonally I should have preferred to withhold judgment on the present reference until the determination by the Privy Council of the Aviation Reference now pending before it on appeal from this court, especially in view of the insistence by counsel representing the province of Quebec that light would be thrown on the issues involved in the present reference by that decision. The majority of my colleagues, however, take the view that the public interest demands that judgment should be given during the present term, in order that the Government may be in a position to obtain the views of the Privy Council on the questions involved in this reference in time to enable it to bring down legislation at the next session of the Dominion Parliament. I somewhat reluctantly defer to that view.\nI have had the advantage of reading the carefully prepared opinions of my colleagues.\nDealing with the first question, the most important thing to observe would seem to be its subject matter. It does not concern the rights of property in the instruments used for communication, their ownership, or civil rights in regard to them, but has to do entirely with the effects produced by them. In other words, it is \u201cradio communication\u201d that is dealt with by this question, rather than the instruments employed in making it, which are alluded to merely incidentally.\nAfter giving the matter such consideration as time and circumstances have permitted, I am of the opinion that question no. 1 should be answered generally in the affirmative. My reason for so concluding is largely that overwhelming convenience\u2014under the circumstances amounting to necessity\u2014dictates that answer. In dealing with this reference, however, I desire it to be clearly understood that I do so solely in the light of the present knowledge of Hertzian waves and radio and upon the facts disclosed in the record. I fully accept the following paragraph from the judgment of my brother Newcombe:\nI interpret the reference as meant to submit the questions for consideration in the light of the existing situation and the knowledge and use of the art, as practically understood and worked, and, having regard to what is stated in the case, assumed as the basis for the hearing. Therefore I proceed upon the assumption that radio communication in Canada is practically Dominion-wide; that the broadcasting of a message in a province, or in a territory of Canada, has its effect in making the message receivable as such, and is also effective by way of interference, not only within the local political area within which the transmission originates, but beyond, for distances exceeding the limits of a province, and that, consequently, if there is to be harmony or reasonable measure of utility or success in the service, it is desirable, if not essential, that the operations should be subject to prudent regulation and control.\nWithout entering into any lengthy discussion of the constitutional issues involved, it seems to be certain that Hertzian waves and radio were not only unknown to, but undreamt of by, the framers of the British North America Act. It is, therefore, not to be expected that language should be found in that Act explicitly covering the subject matter of the present reference. On the other hand, if the Act is to be viewed, as recently suggested by their Lordships of the Privy Council in Edwards v. Attorney-General of Canada[1].\nas a living tree, capable of growth and expansion within its natural limits,\nand if it\nshould be on all occasions interpreted in a large, liberal and comprehensive spirit, considering the magnitude of the subjects with which it purports to deal in very few words,\nand bearing in mind that\nwe are concerned with the interpretation of an Imperial Act, but an Imperial Act creating a constitution for a new country,\nevery effort should be made to find in the B.N.A. Act some head of legislative jurisdiction capable of including the subject matter of this reference. If, however, it should be found impossible to assign that subject matter to any specifically enumerated head of legislative jurisdiction, either in section 91 or in section 92 of the B.N.A. Act, it would seem to be one of the subjects of residuary power under the general jurisdiction conferred on the Dominion by the opening paragraph of section 91.\nIt is also obvious that, for certain purposes and within certain limitations, there are several specific heads of legislative jurisdiction in section 91 broad enough to cover, in part at least, the subject of radio communication and that, in so far as the subject matter falls within those several heads, Dominion legislative jurisdiction as to it is exclusive. I refer to\n5. Postal Service.\n7. Militia, Military and Naval Service, and Defence.\n9. Beacons, Buoys, Lighthouses, and Sable Island.\n10. Navigation and Shipping, (and)\n29. Such Classes of Subjects as are expressly excepted in the Enumeration of the Classes of Subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nIt seems to me that, under this last head, which really brings the exceptions set out in subsection 10 of section 92 into section 91, as distinctive heads of Dominion legislative jurisdiction (City of Toronto v. Bell Telephone Co.[2]), more particularly under the word \u201ctelegraphs\u201d in clause (a) thereof, giving to that word a reasonably broad construction of which it is susceptible (ibid and Attorney-General v. Edison Telegraphs of London[3]\u2014we find a sound basis for holding that \u201cradio communication\u201d is subject to the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament.\nReading through the various subsections of section 92, no one of them do I find broad enough to cover the subject matter of radio communication. The two subsections of section 92 relied on by counsel for the provinces were nos. 13 and 16. No doubt, in some aspects, radio communication has to do with \u201cproperty and civil rights in the province\u201d; but so have many other subjects which have been held to fall within some one of the enumerated heads of section 91, and as to which the concluding paragraph of that section establishes the exclusiveness of Dominion legislative jurisdiction over them. (The Fishenes Case[4]; Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider[5]). Radio communication in this respect does not differ from any of such other subjects. Bearing in mind what Lord Watson said in Attorney-General of Ontario v. Attorney-General of Canada[6], that legislation by the Dominion\nin regard to all matters not enumerated in s. 91, ought to be strictly confined to such matters as are unquestionably of Canadian interest and importance, and ought not to trench upon provincial legislation with respect to any of the classes of subjects enumerated in s. 92.\nand that it is not competent to the Dominion to make laws\nin relation to matters which in each province are substantially of local or private interest, upon the assumption that these matters also concern the peace, order, and good government of the Dominion.\nI fail to find anything of a \u201clocal or private\u201d nature in radio communication such as would exclude Dominion jurisdiction over it. I agree with Mr. Justice Newcombe that\n\u201cradio communication,\u201d in the state of the science and development which it has attained, is not, substantially or otherwise, a local or private matter in the province.\nOf course, it may some day become so, should radio science develop to such an extent that it will be possible so to control the effects of Hertzian waves, that those effects may be confined within the limits of a province, both as to their use and interference by them.\nSubject to such possible further scientific development, I am, for the foregoing reasons, of the opinion that question no. 1 should be presently answered in the affirmative. It is, therefore, unnecessary to answer question no. 2, which is based on the assumption of a negative answer to no. 1.\nMy formal answers to the questions are,\nQuestion no. 1. In view of the present state of radio science as submitted, Yes.\nQuestion no. 2. No answer.\nNewcombe J.\u2014My trouble with this case is to know the facts. Although the narrative of the order of reference and the printed statement of principles were not at the hearing seriously disputed, one is apt to suspect that the knowledge of the art of radio, which we have derived from the submissions and what was said in the course of argument, is still incomplete and, perhaps, in some particulars, not free from error; that some accepted theories are still experimental or tentative, and that there may be possibilities of development and use, not only in the Dominion but also in a provincial field, which have not yet been fully ascertained or tested.\nA difficulty also arises from the fact that the questions propounded do not apply themselves to actual legislation, but seek generally the definition of Dominion authority to \u201cregulate and control radio communication\u201d in, perhaps, its widest sense.\nIn these conditions, it is expedient to proceed with great care and certainty, or caution, and, in affirming or denying a legislative power, wisely to say nothing which may be construed to express or imply an intention to extend a ruling upon the assumed or hypothetical case submitted to a state of actual facts that may prove to be materially different, and which, though at present no more than imaginary, may yet be realized.\nI interpret the reference as meant to submit the questions for consideration in the light of the existing situation and the knowledge and use of the art, as practically understood and worked, and, having regard to what is stated in the case, assumed as the basis for the hearing. Therefore I must proceed upon the assumption that radio communication in Canada is practically Dominion-wide; that the broadcasting of a message in a province, or in a territory of Canada, has its effect in making the message receivable as such, and is also effective by way of interference, not only in the local political area within which the transmission originates, but beyond, for distances exceeding the limits of a province, and that, consequently, if there is to be harmony or reasonable measure of utility or success in the service, it is desirable, if not essential, that the operations should be subject to prudent regulation and control.\nNow, the power of the Dominion to regulate or control is denied, upon two grounds, by the province of Quebec and other provinces which have associated themselves with the argument of Quebec; they say that the exercise of the power, as broadly suggested by the first question, would offend against the provincial enumeration of \u201cProperty and Civil Rights in the Province\u201d; and, secondly, or, perhaps, alternatively, that it would be obnoxious to the concluding paragraph of section 92, \u201cGenerally all Matters of a merely local or private Nature in the Province.\u201d Exceptions are, however, conceded, and these may be introduced no better than by a quotation from Lord Herscheli\u2019s great judgment in the first Fisheries Case[7], where, referring to section 91, he said\nThe earlier part of this section read in connection with the words beginning \u201cand for greater certainty,\u201d appears to amount to a legislative declaration that any legislation falling strictly within any of the classes specially enumerated in s. 91, is not within the legislative competence of the provincial legislatures under s. 92. In any view the enactment is express that laws in relation to matters falling within any of the classes enumerated in s. 91 are within the \u201cexclusive\u201d legislative authority of the Dominion Parliament. Whenever, therefore, a matter is within one of these specified classes, legislation in relation to it by a provincial legislature is in their Lordships\u2019 opinion incompetent. It has been suggested, and this view has been adopted by some of the judges of the Supreme Court, that although any Dominion legislation dealing with the subject would override provincial legislation, the latter is nevertheless valid, unless and until the Dominion Parliament so legislates. Their Lordships think that such a view does not give their due effect to the terms of s. 91, and in particular to the word \u201cexclusively.\u201d It would authorize for example, the enactment of a bankruptcy law or a copyright law in any of the provinces unless and until the Dominion Parliament passed enactments dealing with those subjects. Their Lordships do not think this is consistent with the language and manifest intention of the British North America Act.\nNow, referring to the text of section 91 for the enumerations that may, for present purposes, be invoked, it is enacted by the concluding words of the section that\nAny matter coming within any of the Classes of Subjects enumerated in this Section shall not be deemed to come within the Class of Matters of a local or private Nature comprised in the Enumeration of the Classes of Subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\nAnd it is, I would think, not doubtful that the regulation of radio communication has a Dominion aspect, or at least an overlapping relation, capable of being worked as incidental or ancillary, with respect to some of the subjects specially enumerated in section 91; for example: \u201c2. The Regulation of Trade and Commerce; 5. Postal Service; 7. Military and Naval Service and Defence; 9. Beacons, Buoys, Lighthouses and Sable Island; 10. Navigation and Shipping; 11. Quarantine and the Establishment and Maintenance of Marine Hospitals, and 29. Such Classes of Subjects as are expressly excepted in the Enumeration of the Classes of Subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces.\u201d Most obviously in this true as applied to the three enumerations that are concerned with the safety of ships and navigation. It follows that a provincial legislature could not sanction or uphold any sort of radio communication which would interfere or conflict with competent Dominion regulations, enacted with relation to these enumerated subjects. It is expressly, and most justly, conceded by the factum of the Attorney-General of Quebec that\nWhere any subject is under its exclusive legislative authority the Dominion Parliament has power to regulate by substantive and by ancillary and necessary incidental legislation.\nAlso, by section 132, which has been judicially considered in other cases,\nThe Parliament and Government of Canada shall have all powers necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada, or of any province thereof as part of the British Empire, towards foreign countries, arising under treaties between the Empire and such foreign countries.\nThere is the International Radiotelegraph Convention, \u201cDone at Washington, 27th November, 1927,\u201d between the Governments therein mentioned, including Canada, Great Britain and the United States of America, and ratified on behalf of Canada, 12th June, 1928; also an agreement between Canada, the United States, Newfoundland and Cuba, relative to the assignment of \u201cfrequencies\u201d on the North American continent, effective as from 1st March, 1929. These and other international agreements or regulations, to which Canada adheres, are printed in the appendix of the case; and, in so far as they answer the description of the last quoted section, the Parliament and Government of Canada have, by the express enactment, all powers necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada, or of any province thereof, arising thereunder.\nBut, while Mr. Geoffrion concedes that interference internationally may be avoided under the powers conferred by section 132, he suggests that, if it be necessary to provide against interprovincial interference, the objects should be attained by arrangement between the provinces, and he refers to City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway[8]. That case is mentioned in the recent Aviation Case[9]; and it is distinguishable upon all the points debated with relation to the questions now submitted. I refer to it here by way of reminder that, as shewn by Lord Atkinsin\u2019s remark at the foot of page 345, the power of Parliament to acquire jurisdiction by the exercise of its authority to make a declaration under paragraph (c) of the 10th enumeration of section 92, was not without a persuasive influence in the result which His Lordship reached; and I think all are agreed that paragraph (c) has no application to the radio powers which are now in difference.\nBut while the Dominion has at least the authority to regulate and control radio activities, and to provide against confusion or interference, as affecting its own enumerated subjects, and for the performance of treaty obligations, it also has the comprehensive power involved in the declaration of its authority.\nin relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by the British North America Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces;\nand Quebec, in effect, contends that the classes so excepted include \u201cradio communication,\u201d within the meaning of the first question submitted. As to this, the provincial case seems to depend upon the interpretation of the two provincial powers which I have quoted; and my view is that the subject in question has not the prescribed limitation of locality. It is said that \u201cradio communication,\u201d as explained by the reference, is a matter of \u201cProperty and Civil Rights in the Province,\u201d or of a \u201cmerely local or private Nature in the Province\u201d; and this I deny, because, upon the assumptions involved in the case, the matter substantially extends beyond provincial limits.\nThe words \u201cMatters of a merely local or private Nature\u201d are also used in the last paragraph of section 91, and Lord Watson interpreted them as meant to include and correctly to describe all the matters enumerated in the heads of section 92 as being, from a provincial point of view, of a local or private nature. Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion[10]; and, on the next two pages of the same case His Lordship said, referring to the general authority of Parliament under the introductory enactments of section 91,\nBut to those matters which are not specified among the enumerated subjects of legislation, the exception from s. 92, which is enacted by the concluding words of s. 91, has no application; and, in legislating with regard to such matters, the Dominion Parliament has no authority to encroach upon any class of subjects which is exclusively assigned to provincial legislatures by s. 92. These enactments appear to their Lordships to indicate that the exercise of legislative power of the Parliament of Canada in regard to all matters not enumerated in s. 91, ought to be strictly confined to such matters as are unquestionably of Canadian interest and importance, and ought not to trench upon provincial legislation with respect to any of the classes of subjects enumerated in s. 92. To attach any other construction to the general power which, in supplement of its enumerated powers, is conferred upon the Parliament of Canada by s. 91, would, in their Lordships\u2019 opinion, not only be contrary to the intendment of the Act, but would practically destroy the autonomy of the provinces. If it were once conceded that the Parliament of Canada has authority to make laws applicable to the whole Dominion, in relation to matters which in each province are substantially of local or private interest, upon the assumption that these matters also concern the peace, order, and good government of the Dominion, there is hardly a subject enumerated in s. 92 upon which it might not legislate, to the exclusion of the provincial legislatures.\nAnd, as I interpret the case submitted, \u201cradio communication,\u201d in the state of the science and development which it has attained, is not, substantially or otherwise, a local or private matter in a province. In the course of discussion an attempt was made to distinguish between the transmission of a message and the reception of it; and it was said that the receiving instrument is property in a province, and that a message is received in a province when the instrument, being there, is adapted and worked for that purpose. But the question is directed, not to rights of property in goods or chattels situate within a province, but to \u201cradio communication\u201d\u2014an effect which is not local, but interprovincial. There must be two parties to a communication; there may be many more; and, if the sender be in a foreign country, or in a province or territory of Canada, and the receiver be within another province, it is impossible, as I see it, to declare that the communication, is local, either to the transmitting or to the receiving province.\nAs usual, in cases where the validity of provincial legislation is attacked as engaged with a subject matter not local, the Manitoba Liquor case[11], is cited in support of the power. The passages are at pages 77-80 of Lord McNaghten\u2019s judgment, and the meaning is relieved of some obscurity when the reasons are considered. Manifestly, His Lordship\u2019s conclusion depends upon the text of the particular Act and he quoted and emphasized the recital and the 119th section by which there is introduced a legislative declaration that the object is to suppress the liquor traffic in Manitoba by prohibiting provincial transactions, and that, while the act is intended to prohibit transactions in liquor which take place wholly within the province, except as otherwise specially provided, and to restrict the consumption of liquor within the limits of the province,\nit shall not affect and is not intended to affect bona fide transactions in liquor between a person in the province of Manitoba and a person in another province or in a foreign country, and the provisions of this Act shall be construed accordingly.\nThat section, his Lordship said, was as much part of the Act as any other section contained in it, and must have its full effect in exempting from the operation of the Act the transactions which came within its terms. Their Lordships were not satisfied that the legislature of Manitoba had transgressed the limits of its jurisdiction in passing the Liquor Act. But provincial legislation for the regulation and control of radio communication is a much more expansive matter and cannot, upon present information, be constructed in a manner to qualify as relating to matters of a local or private nature in the province.\nThe subject is one which, undoubtedly, relates to the peace, order and good government of Canada; and I am not satisfied, for any of the reasons which have been submitted, or which I have been able to discover, that it falls within any of the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\nFor these reasons I certify to the Governor in Council, for his information, my opinion that the first question submitted should be answered in the affirmative; and, of course, in view of that conclusion, I am not required to answer the second question.\nRinfret J.\u2014En donnant son opinion sur les questions d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9es au sujet de la loi autorisant le contr\u00f4le de l\u2019a\u00e9ro-nautique[12], mon coll\u00e8gue, Monsieur le Juge Duff, avec qui j\u2019ai concouru, commence son jugement par l\u2019expos\u00e9 suivant:\nThe view presented by the Solicitor General of the questions raised by the interrogatories, which it is our duty to answer, was based primarily upon the proposition that the Dominion possesses authority to legislate upon the subject of aeronautics, in every respect, and that this authority is exclusive, or, at all events, overrides any law of a province.\nThis proposition is supported upon a variety of grounds. It is contended that, in their very nature, the matters embraced within that subject cannot be local, in the provincial sense, and that accordingly the subject is beyond the ambit of section 92; that, in the alternative, it falls within one of the enumerated heads of section 91, no. 10 Navigation and Shipping; that, as a sort of further alternative, so many aspects and incidents of the subject fall within various enumerated heads of section 91, such as the regulation of trade and commerce, undertakings extending beyond the limits of a province, customs, aliens, beacons and lighthouses, postal service, defence, ferries, or under immigration (s. 95), that the subject must as a whole be treated as within Dominion jurisdiction, that being, it is argued, the only interpretation under which the undoubted authority of the Dominion over the various aspects of the subject can be effectively exercised. Still again, it is said, the authority of the Dominion under section 132, to legislate for the performance of its obligations under the Convention relating to Aerial Navigation, 1019, extends over the whole field.\nEn substituant la radiocommunication \u00e0 l\u2019aviation, et en retranchant la mention relative au paragraphe 10 de l\u2019article 91 de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord concernant \u201cNavigation and Shipping\u201d, nous avons dans le passage cite un exact r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de l\u2019argumentation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite de la part du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada dans l\u2019affaire qui nous est actuellement soumise.\nD\u2019autre part, les procureurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux des provinces, pour r\u00e9clamer la juridiction en faveur des gouvernements qu\u2019ils repr\u00e9sentaient, dans cette cause de l\u2019aviation comme dans la pr\u00e9sente, se sont surtout appuy\u00e9s sur le paragraphe 13 (\u201c property and civil rights in the province\u201d) et sur le paragraphe 10 (\u201clocal works and undertakings\u201d) de l\u2019article 92 de FActe constitutional.\nIl en est r\u00e9sult\u00e9, entre la cause de l\u2019aviation et la pr\u00e9sente cause de la radiocommunication, une tr\u00e8s grande analogie, au moins dans la mani\u00e8re dont la question nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. On peut done regretter que nous soyons appel\u00e9s \u00e0 nous prononcer sur les questions qui nous sont actuellement soumises avant d\u2019avoir eu l\u2019avantage de conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9cision finale du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire de l\u2019aviation, car il me para\u00eet \u00e9vident que cette d\u00e9cision nous aurait apport\u00e9 une aide consid\u00e9rable dans la solution du probl\u00e8me que nous avons maintenant \u00e0 trancher.\nDe m\u00eame que dans la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence sur l\u2019aviation, il nous faut ici adapter une loi constitutionnelle datant de 1867 \u00e0 un sujet qui non seulement n\u2019avait aucune existence, mais dont on ne soup\u00e7onnait m\u00eame pas la possibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque. Il est exact de dire cependant que l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord \u201cis always speaking\u201d et que ses dispositions doivent recevoir un sens de plus en plus \u00e9tendu, au fur et \u00e0 mesure que les inventions scientifiques et les d\u00e9veloppements de la vie nationale exigent de nouvelles solutions constitutionnelles[13].\nA la question nouvelle soulev\u00e9e par la d\u00e9couverte de l\u2019aviation, cette cour a r\u00e9pondu que la juridiction primordiale appartenait aux provinces. Il me semble qu\u2019il existe \u00e0 \u013e\u00e9gard de cette question nouvelle qui est maintenant soulev\u00e9e par l\u2019invention de la radio des raisons encore plus fortes pour d\u00e9cider dans le m\u00eame sens.\nLa radiocommunication, telle qu\u2019elle est connue et telle que la science nous la pr\u00e9sente jusqu\u2019\u00e0 date, consiste dans un appareil \u00e9metteur, des ondes radio\u00e9lectriques (que le dossier appelle \u201cHertzian waves\u201d) circulant dans l\u2019\u00e9ther, et un appareil r\u00e9cepteur.\nEn soi, l\u2019appareil \u00e9metteur et l\u2019appareil r\u00e9cepteur sont des objets de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u201cd\u2019une nature locale\u201d situ\u00e9s dans la province, au sens de l\u2019article 92.\nQu\u2019on les envisage comme objets de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 purs et simples, ou comme des travaux couverts par le paragraphe 10 de l\u2019article 92, ils tombent de prime abord sous la juridiction provinciale.\nEn plus, la personne qui op\u00e8re un appareil \u00e9metteur ou la personne qui op\u00e8re un r\u00e9cepteur, exerce un droit civil dans la province; et l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre op\u00e9ration, prise isol\u00e9ment, est indiscutablement mati\u00e8re \u00e0 contr\u00f4le provincial.\nDe ce point de vue, il existe sans doute une diff\u00e9rence entre l\u2019op\u00e9ration de l\u2019appareil r\u00e9cepteur et l\u2019op\u00e9ration de l\u2019appareil \u00e9metteur. Alors que la r\u00e9ception ne peut d\u2019aucune fa\u00e7on \u00eatre envisag\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant autrement que d\u2019une nature purement locale, il est exact de dire que, suivant les donn\u00e9es actuelles de la science, l\u2019\u00e9mission ne peut pas \u00eatre circonscrite dans un rayon pr\u00e9cis et les ondes qui sont mises en mouvement par l\u2019appareil \u00e9metteur se propagent dans toutes les directions, sans qu\u2019on puisse les limiter aux fronti\u00e8res d\u2019un territoire. Je ne crois pas cependant que cette derni\u00e8re particularit\u00e9 enl\u00e8ve \u00e0 l\u2019op\u00e9ration de \u013eappareil \u00e9metteur son caract\u00e8re de droit civil dans la province, suivant la port\u00e9e qu\u2019il faut donner au paragraphe 13 de l\u2019article 92. Un droit civil ne perd pas sa nature de droit civil contr\u00f4lable par la province simplement parce qu\u2019il peut produire des effets au del\u00e0 de la province. Un contrat pass\u00e9 dans une province produit des r\u00e9sultats en dehors de cette province, sans que pour cela il soit soustrait \u00e0 \u013eautorit\u00e9 provinciale. Une firme, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, qui fait avec un voyageur de commerce un contrat de louage de ses services, verra sa responsabilit\u00e9 engag\u00e9e vis-\u00e0-vis d\u2019une personne \u00e0 Vancouver, dans la Colombie-Britannique, par l\u2019acte de ce voyageur de commerce, et cette responsabilit\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant du contrat d\u2019abord fait \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al continuera d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9gie par la loi provinciale.\nPour prendre un exemple encore plus frappant, un journal publi\u00e9 \u00e0 Toronto et dont la circulation est r\u00e9pandue dans tout le Dominion ne cessera pas pour cela d\u2019\u00eatre de la part de ses propri\u00e9taires l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et d\u2019un droit civil dans la province d\u2019Ontario et d\u2019\u00eatre subordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation de la province.\nSupposons encore une fanfare qui jouerait un concert dans une province, sur les bords de la fronti\u00e8re. Elle ne tomberait -pas sous le contr\u00f4le f\u00e9d\u00e9ral parce que les sons de sa musique seraient entendus dans une autre province.\nOn pourrait donner ainsi des exemples presque \u00e0 \u013einfini.\nSi maintenant l\u2019on traite l\u2019appareil \u00e9metteur ou l\u2019appareil r\u00e9cepteur comme des \u201ctravaux... d\u2019une nature locale\u201d, je ne crois pas qu\u2019on puisse pr\u00e9tendre que, par le seul fait que ces travaux ont une r\u00e9percussion au del\u00e0 des fronti\u00e8res d\u2019une province, ils perdent leur caract\u00e8re local.\nJe suppose un phare qui serait \u00e9rig\u00e9 sur le territoire d\u2019une province mais suffisamment pr\u00e8s de la fronti\u00e8re pour que ses feux et sa lumi\u00e8re soient projet\u00e9s sur le territoire d\u2019une autre province. Il me semble que l\u2019on ne pourrait en conclure que ce phare cesse d\u2019\u00eatre un ouvrage d\u2019une nature locale au sens du paragraphe 10 de l\u2019article 92.\nJ\u2019\u00e9carte donc la pr\u00e9tention qui voudrait que par cela seul qu\u2019un droit civil ou un ouvrage local produit des effets en dehors d\u2019une province, il acquiert ipso facto un caract\u00e8re qui a pour effet de le soustraire \u00e0 la juridiction provinciale. Mais on objecte que le sujet dont il s\u2019agit n\u2019est pas l\u2019appareil \u00e9metteur ou l\u2019appareil r\u00e9cepteur en soi, que la v\u00e9ritable question est la communication qui s\u2019\u00e9tablit entre les deux appareils et que, comme il est impossible de restreindre cette communication aux limites d\u2019une province, il en r\u00e9sulte qu\u2019elle tombe dans le domaine f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\nSur ce point, on invoque les sous-paragraphes du paragraphe 10 de l\u2019article 92 qui sont des exceptions et qui, en vertu du paragraphe 29 de l\u2019article 91, doivent \u00eatre envisag\u00e9s comme faisant partie des cat\u00e9gories de sujets r\u00e9serv\u00e9s au pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\nIl y a l\u00e0 trois sous-paragraphes: (a), (b) et (c). (b) s\u2019occupe des lignes de bateaux \u00e0 vapeur entre les provinces et les pays d\u00e9pendant de l\u2019Empire britannique ou tout autre pays \u00e9tranger. Il n\u2019a donc rien \u00e0 voir avec la question actuelle, (c) traite des travaux qui, bien qu\u2019enti\u00e8rement situ\u00e9s dans la province, sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9s par le parlement du Canada \u00eatre pour l\u2019avantage g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada ou pour l\u2019avantage de deux ou d\u2019un plus grand nombre de provinces. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une d\u00e9claration de ce genre dans la question qui nous est soumise.\nReste le sous-paragraphe (a). Il s\u2019applique \u00e0 \u201clines of steam or other ships, railways, canals, telegraphs and other works and undertakings connecting the province with any other or others of the provinces, or extending beyond the limits of the province\u201d.\nL\u2019interpr\u00e9tation souveraine qui doit nous guider dans la port\u00e9e qu\u2019il faut donner \u00e0 ce sous-paragraphe a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway[14]. Il y est dit, en r\u00e9f\u00e9rant aux travaux dont il s\u2019agit dans ce sous-paragraphe: \u201cThese works are physical things, not services.\u201d Or, la distinction fondamentale entre la radiocommunication et la communication par t\u00e9l\u00e9graphe, t\u00e9l\u00e9phone ou autres travaux du m\u00eame genre auxquels s\u2019applique le sous-paragraphe (a) du paragraphe 10 est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment que la radiocommunication peut \u00eatre un \u201cservice\u201d, mais elle n\u2019est pas un \u201cphysical thing\u201d.\nEn outre, il n\u2019existe pas de connexion physique entre l\u2019appareil \u00e9metteur et l\u2019appareil r\u00e9cepteur, comme le fil qui, dans le t\u00e9l\u00e9graphe et le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, relie l\u2019endroit d\u2019o\u00f9 sont \u00e9mis les sons ou les signaux \u00e0 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 ils sont re\u00e7us. A la rigueur, une ligne de radiocommunication \u00e9tablie par une firme commerciale pour le service du public partant d\u2019une ou de plusieurs stations d\u2019\u00e9mission fixes qu\u2019elle poss\u00e9derait dans une province et qui transmettrait des messages de toutes natures \u00e0 l\u2019aide des ondes hertziennes \u00e0 des stations de r\u00e9ception fixes, dont la firme serait \u00e9galement propri\u00e9taire, et qui seraient situ\u00e9es dans d\u2019autres provinces, constitueraient un \u201cundertaking\u201d tombant sous la juridiction f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Il semblerait cependant que, dans ce cas, le pouvoir f\u00e9d\u00e9ral proc\u00e9derait non pas du sous-paragraphe (a) du paragraphe 10 de l\u2019article 92, mais du paragraphe 2 de \u013earticle 91 concernant \u201cThe regulation of trade and commerce\u201d.\nNous avons eu tout derni\u00e8rement un exemple de l\u2019application de ce principe de juridiction dans l\u2019arr\u00eat de cette cour Re: Lawson v. Interior Tree Fruit and Vegetable Committee of Direction[15].\nIl est juste toutefois de faire r\u00e9marquer que m\u00eame l\u2019attribution de la juridiction f\u00e9d\u00e9rale sur une entreprise commerciale, comme celle dont nous venons de parler, reliant deux, ou plusieurs provinces, laisserait quand m\u00eame intacte la juridiction provinciale sur des entreprises du m\u00eame genre \u00e9tablies entre des stations fixes exclusivement \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur d\u2019une province, et surtout sur tous les appareils op\u00e9r\u00e9s par des amateurs ou par des gouvernements locaux, ou de toute autre fa\u00e7on qui ne serait pas pour des fins de profit.\nMais tous les cas mentionn\u00e9s au sous-paragraphe (a) du paragraphe 10 sont des cas o\u00f9 il s\u2019agit d\u2019une connexion physique continue dans les travaux ou l\u2019entreprise (sauf peut-\u00eatre les lignes de bateaux \u00e0 vapeur ou autres b\u00e2timents, avec lesquels la radiocommunication n\u2019a aucune esp\u00e8ce d\u2019analogie) et d\u2019un \u201cphysical thing\u201d tout entier sous le m\u00eame contr\u00f4le, sinon de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, au moins d\u2019op\u00e9ration. La plus r\u00e9cente d\u00e9cision sur ce point se trouve dans l\u2019arr\u00eat du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Luscar Collieries v. McDonald[16], o\u00f9 Lord Warrington of Clyffe, qui a prononc\u00e9 le jugement, revient \u00e0 deux reprises sur le caract\u00e8re de continuit\u00e9 de la voie de chemin de fer dont il s\u2019agissait dans cette cause et dit (p. 932):\nA part of a continuous system of railways operated together by the Canadian National Railways Company and connecting the province of Alberta with other provinces of the Dominion; (puis p. 933): There is a continuous connection by railway between the point of the Luscar Branch farthest from its junction with the Mountain Park Branch and parts of Canada outside the province of Alberta.\nCes expressions semblent bien marquer que, pour tomber sous \u013eeffet du sous-paragraphe (a) du paragraphe 10, il faut le double caract\u00e8re de continuit\u00e9 dans le \u201cphysical thing\u201d et de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, de contr\u00f4le, ou, au moins, d\u2019op\u00e9ration par la m\u00eame personne ou la m\u00eame compagnie, sans quoi \u013eon ne se trouve plus en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un seul \u201cundertaking\u201d, mais l\u2019on a plusieurs \u201cundertakings\u201d distincts.\nCes deux caract\u00e8res manquent \u00e0 la radiocommunication, dont la nature habituelle et la plus ordinaire est de proc\u00e9der d\u2019un appareil \u00e9metteur qui appartient \u00e0 un propri\u00e9taire vers des appareils r\u00e9cepteurs qui appartiennent \u00e0 d\u2019autres propri\u00e9taires compl\u00e8tement ind\u00e9pendants, sans aucune esp\u00e8ce de relations avec le propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019appareil \u00e9metteur, et que ce dernier ne conna\u00eet m\u00eame pas. Du point de vue l\u00e9gal, il est difficile de voir la distinction qu\u2019on peut faire entre la radiocommunication op\u00e9r\u00e9e dans ces conditions et la transmission des sons de toute autre fa\u00e7on (comme, par exemple, par la fanfare dont nous parlions tout \u00e0 l\u2019heure) d\u2019une province \u00e0 l\u2019autre. Et il est assez juste, sous ce rapport, d\u2019assimiler l\u2019appareil r\u00e9cepteur \u00e0 une simple amplification de l\u2019appareil auditif humain, puisque sa fonction n\u2019est rien autre chose que de rendre perceptibles \u00e0 l\u2019oreille des sons ou des signaux transmis \u00e0 travers l\u00e9ther par la propagation de vagues intangibles.\nDe toutes fa\u00e7ons, par cons\u00e9quent, et sauf les exceptions que j\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9es au cours de ce jugement jusqu\u2019ici, le sujet de la radiocommunication me para\u00eet tomber essentiellement dans la cat\u00e9gorie des sujets de \u201cProperty and civil rights in the province\u201d ou de \u201cLocal works and undertakings\u201d, tels que pr\u00e9vus au paragraphe 10 de l\u2019article 92.\nDans ces conditions, la juridiction primordiale r\u00e9side donc dans les provinces, et cette juridiction ne peut \u00eatre entam\u00e9e qu\u2019en autant que l\u2019on peut trouver dans l\u2019article 91 des sujets de juridiction f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui donneraient, dans les limites de leur application particuli\u00e8re, le pouvoir d\u2019empi\u00e9ter sur cette juridiction provinciale primordiale.\nEn effet, d\u00e8s qu\u2019un sujet tombe sous le contr\u00f4le provincial en vertu de l\u2019une des clauses de l\u2019article 92, il ne peut \u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9 au domaine f\u00e9d\u00e9ral qu\u2019\u00e0 la condition de tomber express\u00e9ment sous \u013eune des clauses de \u013earticle 91; et il est absolument fallacieux de pr\u00e9tendre que, sauf dans un cas de \u201cnational emergency\u201d, le Dominion pourrait s\u2019emparer de ce contr\u00f4le en vertu de la clause r\u00e9siduaire et sous pr\u00e9texte que l\u2019autorit\u00e9 provinciale n\u2019a pas l\u2019ampleur voulue pour contr\u00f4ler effectivement le sujet qui est attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 sa juridiction.\nPour mieux exprimer ma pens\u00e9e, je me permettrai de citer sur ce point un passage du jugement de notre coll\u00e8gue, Monsieur le juge Duff, dans la cause de The King v. Eastern Terminal Elevator Company[17]:\nThe other fallacy is (the two are, perhaps, different forms of the same error) that the Dominion has such power because no single province, nor, indeed, all the provinces acting together, could put into effect such a sweeping scheme. The authority arises, it is said, under the residuary clause because of the necessary limits of the provincial authority. This is precisely the view which was advanced in the Board of Commerce Case[18], and, indeed, is the view which was unsuccessfully put forward in the Montreal Street Railway Case[19], where it was pointed out that in a system involving a division of powers such as that set up by the Br\u00ectish North Amer\u00ecca Act, it may often be that subsidiary legislation by the provinces or by the Dominion is required to give full effect to some beneficial and necessary scheme of legislation not entirely within the powers of either.\nCela m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 examiner de plus pr\u00e8s la v\u00e9ritable base sur laquelle, de la part du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, on a voulu placer l\u2019argumentation en faveur de la juridiction f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\nL\u2019on nous a dit que, \u00e0 cause de sa nature m\u00eame, la radiocommunication \u00e9chappait au domaine provincial et quelle ne pouvait \u00eatre contr\u00f4l\u00e9e d\u2019une fa\u00e7on efficace que par le pouvoir f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, parce qu\u2019elle exige un contr\u00f4le central et unique.\nA mon humble avis, c\u2019est l\u00e0 porter la discussion exactement sur le terrain dont parle Monsieur le juge Duff dans le passage que je viens de citer, et c\u2019est nous ramener, une fois de plus, \u00e0 cet argument si souvent offert et autant de fois rejet\u00e9 par les tribunaux que, parce qu\u2019il serait plus avantageux de concentrer toute la l\u00e9gislation sur un sujet entre les mains du pouvoir central, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, du pouvoir f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, il en r\u00e9sulte que le f\u00e9d\u00e9ral devrait avoir juridiction. Il n\u2019y a pas le moindre doute que s\u2019il existait un seul parlement, tous ces conflits de juridiction seraient \u00e9vit\u00e9s. Mais cet argument de \u201cconvenience\u201d ou de \u201cinconvenience\u201d ne saurait \u00e9videmment constituer une r\u00e8gle d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation. La constitution du Canada a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une union f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en distribuant les pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs entre un parlement central et des parlements provinciaux. C\u2019est uniquement par l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du texte de cette constitution que l\u2019on doit \u00eatre guid\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019attribuer un sujet \u00e0 l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre juridiction. La question de savoir s\u2019il serait plus avantageux que les choses fussent autrement ne saurait entrer en ligne de compte et, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, ne saurait trouver place devant une cour de justice. Le principe que, par suite du fait qu\u2019une l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale serait pour le plus grand avantage du Canada, ou rencontrerait d\u2019une fa\u00e7on plus efficace les exigences de la situation, il en r\u00e9sulterait que le pouvoir central a la comp\u00e9tence pour l\u2019adopter a re\u00e7u son coup de gr\u00e2ce dans le jugement de Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider[20].\nL\u2019autre point soulev\u00e9 de la part du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, et l\u2019on peut dire sans doute le pivot de son argumentation, c\u2019est que, dans l\u2019\u00e9tat actuel de la science de la radio, il est absolument impossible d\u2019emp\u00eacher les inconv\u00e9nients r\u00e9sultant des interf\u00e9rences, et que, \u00e0 moins d\u2019une l\u00e9gislation uniforme ayant pour but de r\u00e9partir ce que j\u2019appellerai les bandes de communication (\u201cchannels of communication\u201d), il se produira une telle confusion que tous les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices de la radiodiffusion seront absolument annihil\u00e9s. On en conclut que cela n\u00e9cessite le contr\u00f4le unique du parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\nDe la part des provinces, on a ni\u00e9 le danger de cette interf\u00e9rence et on a assur\u00e9, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, qu\u2019il y avait exag\u00e9ration dans la pr\u00e9tention \u00e9mise par le Dominion. En la prenant pour acquise, je ne vois pas comment ce fait peut venir modifier la question de juridiction.\nSi j\u2019ai bien compris le d\u00e9veloppement de cet argument, le brouillage peut avoir lieu \u00e0 la source, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire au poste \u00e9metteur, ou au moment de la r\u00e9ception. De toutes mani\u00e8res, c\u2019est le r\u00e9cepteur qui est emp\u00each\u00e9 de recevoir utilement la radiocommunication. Si l\u2019interf\u00e9rence provient d\u2019une cause locale situ\u00e9e dans la m\u00eame province que l\u2019appareil r\u00e9cepteur, la province qui a juridiction sur l\u2019appareil r\u00e9cepteur peut \u00e9galement adopter la l\u00e9gislation n\u00e9cessaire pour emp\u00eacher cette interf\u00e9rence. Si la difficult\u00e9 provient d\u2019une r\u00e9partition des \u201cchannels\u201d entre les provinces, il m\u2019est impossible de voir pourquoi la solution ne pourrait pas \u00eatre trouv\u00e9e dans une entente entre les provinces, ainsi qu\u2019il est sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway[21].\nMais il semble admis que l\u2019interf\u00e9rence peut tout autant provenir d\u2019une source ext\u00e9rieure non seulement \u00e0 l\u2019une des provinces, mais d\u2019une source ext\u00e9rieure au pays lui-m\u00eame. Je d\u00e9duirais m\u00eame de l\u2019expos\u00e9 scientifique qui est au dossier et de l\u2019argumentation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite devant nous que la principale, pour ne pas dire l\u2019unique, difficult\u00e9 de toute la situation vient des Etats-Unis, pays voisin, et de l\u2019exploitation du nombre consid\u00e9rable de postes \u00e9metteurs qui se trouvent dans ce pays. Or, l\u2019on ne peut \u00e9viter de faire remarquer que s\u2019il en est ainsi, ce n\u2019est pas par une l\u00e9gislation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qu\u2019on emp\u00eachera cette interf\u00e9rence. Le parlement du Canada sera tout aussi impuissant que n\u2019importe quel parlement des provinces pour l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur une situation de ce genre. Aucune loi du Canada ne pourrait emp\u00eacher les postes \u00e9metteurs des Etats-Unis de causer dans notre pays, ou dans chacune des provinces, toutes les interf\u00e9rences que la science pr\u00e9voit.\nLa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019argument du Dominion serait donc:\n1o Ce n\u2019est pas parce qu\u2019une personne situ\u00e9e ailleurs dans le Dominion vient causer dans une province une interf\u00e9rence avec l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit civil dans cette province que le Dominion acquerra de ce fait une juridiction sur ce droit civil. Cette interf\u00e9rence constitue un conflit entre deux droits civils. Un conflit de ce genre n\u2019a pas pour r\u00e9sultat de soustraire les droits civils \u00e0 la juridiction provinciale et de les transf\u00e9rer au domaine f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\n2\u00b0 Si la source de l\u2019interf\u00e9rence est situ\u00e9e dans le pays, bien que dans une autre province, la v\u00e9ritable mani\u00e8re pour les provinces de r\u00e9gler le conflit entre les droits civils qui sont respectivement de leur domaine, est par une entente entre les provinces. Le Dominion n\u2019acquiert aucune juridiction comme cons\u00e9quence d\u2019un conflit de ce genre. 3\u00b0 Si la source est situ\u00e9e en dehors du pays, le Dominion, par sa propre l\u00e9gislation, est tout aussi impuissant que n\u2019importe laquelle des provinces pour y mettre fin; et la seule ressource en pareil cas: c\u2019est le trait\u00e9 avec le ou les pays voisins.\nAu point de vue pratique, je crois bien que, en donnant \u00e0 \u013eobjection f\u00e9d\u00e9rale la plus ample port\u00e9e que l\u2019on puisse lui attribuer, la vraie question qui r\u00e9sulte du danger de l\u2019interf\u00e9rence est eri r\u00e9alit\u00e9 une question internationale. Or, du moment qu\u2019on en arrive \u00e0 cette conclusion, la difficult\u00e9 de juridiction ne se pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 plus. Une question internationale ne peut se r\u00e9gler que par un trait\u00e9; et, dans ce domaine, le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a toute la latitude n\u00e9cessaire. L\u2019article 132 de l\u2019Acte de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord \u00e9tablit ses pouvoirs en pareil cas; et, dans le jugement que cette cour a rendu sur la question d\u2019aviation[22], nous avons d\u00e9fini les droits du parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en mati\u00e8re de trait\u00e9s, tant dans leur adoption que dans leur ex\u00e9cution, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait pas lieu d\u2019y revenir, sujet naturellement \u00e0 ce que pourra dire le Conseil Priv\u00e9 sur cette question.\nDans la cause actuelle, il est r\u00e9sult\u00e9 de l\u2019argumentation de part et d\u2019autre que l\u2019\u00e9tendue des pouvoirs du parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, agissant en vertu de l\u2019article 132 de l\u2019acte constitutionnel, ne faisait pas. l\u2019objet de la moindre discussion. Il suffit peut-\u00eatre de faire remarquer, par cons\u00e9quent, que c\u2019est l\u00e0, en d\u00e9finitive, que le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral va trouver le rem\u00e8de \u00e0 la principale difficult\u00e9 qui semble le pr\u00e9occuper \u00e0 l\u2019heure qu\u2019il est, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire cette question d\u2019interf\u00e9rence. Elle ne peut se r\u00e9gler que par trait\u00e9; et, en mati\u00e8re de trait\u00e9s, les pouvoirs f\u00e9d\u00e9raux sont probablement illimit\u00e9s.\nEt tout ce que je viens de. dire au sujet de l\u2019interf\u00e9rence provenant de l\u2019\u00e9tranger s\u2019applique avec autant de force, au Canada, \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation de la radiodiffusion et de la radiocommunication venant de l\u2019\u00e9tranger. L\u00e0 encore, c\u2019est une question de trait\u00e9; et sur ce point le f\u00e9d\u00e9ral est souverain.\nMais, si l\u2019on se borne au domaine national, mon opinion est que, pour les raisons que j\u2019ai expos\u00e9es, la base de la juridiction en mati\u00e8re de radiocommunication est primordialement entre les mains des provinces.\nIl reste \u00e9videmment que, nonobstant cette juridiction provinciale primordiale, le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral conserve la juridiction pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante chaque fois qu\u2019il s\u2019agit \u010fun des sujets qui lui sont express\u00e9ment attribu\u00e9s par l\u2019article 91. Cela est admis dans le factum qui nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis de la part de la province de Qu\u00e9bec:\nIt may be at once -conceded that where any subject is under its exclusive legislative authority the Dominion Parliament has power to legislate by substantive and by ancillary and necessarily incidental legislation.\nCela comprendrait, au moins, les sujets suivants:\n1\u00ba \u201cThe regulation of Trade and Commerce\u201d, dans les limites qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9es \u00e0 ce sujet dans les arr\u00eats de Citizens Insurance Company v. Parsons[23]; The Insurance Reference[24]; The Board of Commerce Act, 1919, et The Combines and Fair Prices Act, 1919[25];\n2\u00b0 \u201cPostal service\u201d;\n3o \u201cMilitia, Military and Naval Service, and Defence\u201d;\n4\u00b0 \u201cBeacons, buoys, lighthouses and Sable Island\u201d;\n5\u00b0 \u201cNavigation and Shipping\u201d;\n6\u00b0 \u201cSea coast and inland fisheries\u201d;\n7\u00b0 Les cat\u00e9gories de sujets express\u00e9ment except\u00e9s dans \u013e\u00e9num\u00e9ration des cat\u00e9gories de sujets exclusivement assign\u00e9s par la loi constitutionnelle aux l\u00e9gislatures des provinces, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 29 de l\u2019article 91, dans les limites que j\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9es au cours de ce jugement.\nCe que j\u2019ai dit jusqu\u2019ici me dispenserait de traiter plus amplement de la juridiction provinciale. Je crois cependant devoir ajouter que m\u00eame si, contrairement \u00e0 la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j\u2019en arrive, le sujet de la radiocommunication appartient primordialement au domaine f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, l\u2019on ne pourrait quand m\u00eame dire que son contr\u00f4le est absolu, ou, pour employer une expression que nous avons adopt\u00e9e lors de la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence sur l\u2019aviation, que ce contr\u00f4le existe \u201cin every respect\u201d.\nIl me para\u00eet certain que pour la r\u00e9paration des dommages moraux et mat\u00e9riels qui pourraient \u00eatre caus\u00e9s par la radiocommunication, pour la responsabilit\u00e9 civile en mati\u00e8re de radiodiffusion, il y aura lieu de recourir aux r\u00e8gles du droit civil, et, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation provinciale. Les droits des propri\u00e9taires de postes \u00e9metteurs, ou les droits des propri\u00e9taires d\u2019appareils de r\u00e9ception devront quand m\u00eame \u00eatre r\u00e9gis par le droit civil. En plus, il y a, entre les divers \u00e9metteurs, ou entre les \u00e9metteurs et les compositeurs, \u00e9crivains, auteurs de tous genres, orateurs, conf\u00e9renciers, artistes ou ex\u00e9cutants, fournisseurs d\u2019information, annonceurs, toutes les personnes d\u00e9sireuses de transmettre des communications ou de faire de la r\u00e9clame, des rapports \u00e9ventuels de droit priv\u00e9, civil ou commercial qui devront trouver leur solution dans le droit commun des provinces et dans la l\u00e9gislation provinciale. (Voir Revue Juridique internationale de la radio-\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, 1930, n\u00b0 24, p. 234.)\nEnfin, toujours si le sujet de la radiodiffusion appartient de prime abord \u00e0 la juridiction f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, je ne vois pas bien comment on pourrait emp\u00eacher les provinces d\u2019exercer leur pouvoir de taxation directe en vertu du paragraphe 2 de l\u2019article 92, et leur pouvoir de licence dans le but de pr\u00e9lever un revenu pour des objets provinciaux, locaux ou municipaux, en vertu du paragraphe 9 de l\u2019article 92.\nComme cons\u00e9quence de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je r\u00e9ponds comme suit aux questions qui nous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises:\nJ\u2019interpr\u00e8te la premi\u00e8re question comme impliquant de la part du gouvernement du Canada une juridiction absolue et sous tous les rapports; et ma r\u00e9ponse est dans la n\u00e9gative.\nQuant \u00e0 la seconde question, les diff\u00e9rents aspects sous lesquels, \u00e0 mon avis, le parlement du Canada a juridiction en mati\u00e8re de radiocommunication sont expos\u00e9s en d\u00e9tail dans le pr\u00e9sent jugement.\nLamont J.\u2014In this case I agree with my brother Rinfret that the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament over the subject of radio communication is not exclusive, although, in some particulars, a very large measure of control admittedly belongs to it.\nWhen we consider the nature of radio communication and the fact that once the electro-magnetic waves are discharged from the transmitting stations they cannot be confined within the boundaries of a province, or even the limits of a country, it is evident that a provincial legislature, whose jurisdiction is only province wide, is not in a position to control the transmission of these waves, yet, without some control, radio communication would be impossible. So far, therefore, as the transmission of the waves is concerned, a very wide jurisdiction must, in the present state of the art, be conceded to the Dominion Parliament. It belongs to Parliament because the more important matters which must be regulated and controlled lie in the international field where control can only be assured by treaty, convention or agreement between nations.\nAs indicating the matters over which those who have been dealing with radio communication in a practical way have felt the necessity for control, reference may be made to the International Radiotelegraph Convention at Washington, in November, 1927, and also to the agreement between Canada, the United States, Newfoundland, Cuba, et al. (effective since March 1, 1929), relating to the assignment of frequencies on the North American Continent. All parties to these agreements recognize that until the development of the art progresses to the stage where radio interference can be eliminated, special administrative arrangements are necessary to minimize this interference and promote standardization. To this end the contracting governments have agreed that all transmitting stations will, so far as possible, be established and operated in such manner as not to interfere with radio electric communication of other contracting governments, or persons authorized by them to conduct a public radio service; that no transmission station will be established or worked by an individual without a special licence issued by the government of the country to which the station is subject; that they will propose legislative measures to prevent the unauthorized transmission and reception of correspondence of a private nature, or the divulgence of messages received; and, further, that they will take necessary measures to connect the International Radio Service with the general communication system of each country.\nThe matters covered by these agreements shew the extent of the field in which control can only be secured by agreements between the nations. As to these matters jurisdiction lies with the Dominion Parliament under section 132 of the B.N.A. Act, 1867, which reads as follows:\u2014 The Parliament and Government of Canada shall have all powers necessary or proper for performing the Obligations of Canada or of any Province thereof, as Part of the British Empire, towards Foreign Countries arising under Treaties between the Empire and such Foreign Countries.\nBesides the transmission of electro-magnetic waves there are other matters in respect of which jurisdiction to regulate and control must exist in some authority. These are, for example, the capturing of these waves and the delivery of the messages they contain. These, to my mind, present a very different question from the transmission of the waves into space. According to Mr. Bain\u2019s report, which is printed with the case, the receiving apparatus performs two functions: it receives the transmitted wave, and converts it into an understandable signal. When electro-magnetic waves are thrown into space from one or more transmitting stations, they pass, by virtue of their potentially expanding force, not only over every parcel of land in the province in which the transmitter is situate, but over land far beyond the province. In the case of broadcasting they are not directed to any particular individual, but are left to be captured by anyone who can capture them. Where an owner of land in a province erects on his property a receiving antenna and to it attaches an apparatus which selects a given wave and delivers the message impressed upon it as an understandable signal to those who are within the limits of its varrying power, I am unable to see why the receiving apparatus cannot properly be designated a \u201clocal work\u201d under no. 10 of s. 92. The services it performs, first in capturing the wave and then in extracting and delivering its message, are all performed within the province and, therefore, localized. In my opinion such localized service and such an instrumentality constitute a \u201clocal work.\u201d If it is not a local work within no. 10 of s. 92, I should consider that it would then fall within no. 16 \u201cGenerally all Matters of a merely local or private Nature in the Province.\u201d Prima facie, therefore, legislation upon these subjects would come within the jurisdiction assigned to the provincial legislatures by s. 92.\nThe jurisdiction of the province, however, is subject to being overborne by competent legislation on the part of the Dominion Parliament, ancillary or incidental, to any of the enumerated heads of s. 91. I would, therefore, answer the questions as follows:\u2014\n1. Has the Parliament of Canada jurisdiction to regulate and control radio communication, including the transmission and reception of signs, signals, pictures and sounds of all kinds by means of Hertzian waves, and including the right to determine the character, use and location of apparatus employed?\nAnswer: Not exclusive jurisdiction.\n2. If not, in what particular or particulars or to what extent is the jurisdiction of Parliament limited?\nAnswer: The jurisdiction of Parliament is limited as set out above.\nSmith J.\u2014There are submitted, for the hearing and consideration of the court, pursuant to the authority of s. 55 of The Supreme Court Act, the following questions:\u2014\n1. Has the Parliament of Canada jurisdiction to regulate and control radio communication, including the transmission and reception of signs, signals, pictures and sounds of all kinds by means of Hertzian waves, and including the right to determine the character, use and location of apparatus employed?\n2. If not, in what particular or particulars or to what extent is the jurisdiction of Parliament limited?\nIt becomes necessary in the first place to consider the nature of radio communication, how it is brought about, the extent of its effects, its usefulness to the inhabitants of the country at large, and the manner in which that usefulness may be made available.\nThe principles underlying radio communication are set out in an article compiled by J. W. Bain, radio engineer of the Marine Department, and printed in the case. This document is inserted for the convenience of the court, and it is stated that its accuracy may be verified by reference to the various standard textbooks on the subject. Its general accuracy was, I think, not controverted, and I therefore resort to this document for a brief general description of how radio communication is effected.\nAn alternating current is one which periodically changes direction in its circuit. For a certain time it flows in one direction, with varying strength, and then reverses and flows for an equal time in the opposite direction. The time in fractions of a second which elapses between two successive maximum values of current in the same direction is called a period or cycle, and the number of such periods or cycles per second is called the \u201cfrequency\u201d of the alternating current. The maximum value to which the current rises in each half cycle is called the \u201camplitude\u201d of the current. A high frequency alternating current is one of which the frequency is reckoned in tens of thousands:\nBy the use of alternate electric current in a transmitting apparatus, magnetic and electric fields are created, which expand and contract with the varying strength of the current, the energy being continually sent out into the surrounding medium and returned to the wire to be sent out again with a reversal of direction as the current increases from zero to maximum in one direction, and then decreases to zero, to increase again to a maximum in the opposite direction. If the frequency is very high, all the energy cannot return to the wire after each half-\u0441\u0443cle, and it remains in space, to be pushed further out by the next expansion of the field; and the energy so pushed out at each successive cycle forms an electro-magnetic wave, which is radiated out from the radio antenna.\nIt is formed of two fields, a magnetic and an electric field at right angles to each other and to the direction of propagation, varying in intensity in step with one another and at the frequency of the current which gave rise to them, and travelling through space at the speed of light, that is: three hundred million metres per second. This figure of three hundred million, when divided by the frequency in cycles per second, gives the wave length in metres, and, conversely, when divided by the wave length, gives the frequency.\nPart of the energy is radiated in a direction parallel to the surface of the earth, and forms what is known as the direct or ground wave. Another part is radiated upwards into space, and there exists in the upper part of the atmosphere a conducting layer of electrified particles which possesses the property of reflecting radio waves back to earth, making them available, to a certain extent, for radio communication.\nThe electro-magnetic waves here referred to are energy waves sent out into surrounding space in the manner indicated, and are the means by which radio communication is carried on. This communication involves not only the production and radiation of electro-magnetic waves, but also their reception by suitable apparatus, which intercepts these waves by means of a receiving antenna. The passage of the waves across this antenna produces in it a voltage. The receiving apparatus, which is coupled to this antenna, must be capable of so amplifying the small voltage generated in the receiving antenna as to deliver at the output end a signal of suitable strength. Owing to the great number of electro-magnetic fields, due to the waves issuing from a corresponding number of transmitting stations engaged in the various services of radio communication, the receiving apparatus must also be able to discriminate between all these waves and select the desired one.\nThe fundamental method of arranging the receiving apparatus so as to select the desired wave is by tuning it to the frequency of the wave so desired. It follows that if more than one wave of the same or nearly the same frequency are coming to the receiving apparatus, one would interfere with the reception of the others and destroy the efficiency of all. In order to prevent this result, it is necessary that stations sending out these waves within certain distances of each other be limited to the use of frequencies sufficiently separated to avoid such interference.\nBy International Convention, frequencies from 550 kilocycles to 1,500 kilocycles have been appropriated to the service of broadcasting, and this band of 950 kilocycles is divided into 96 channels, giving approximately a width of 10 kilocycles to each channel, deemed necessary to prevent a transmitting station operating on one of these channels from interfering with the station operating on an adjoining channel. The electro-magnetic waves sent out from a transmitting station ordinarily travel through space in all directions, and the distances at which they can be picked up by a receiver, and at which they may cause interference with other transmitting stations, vary with the electric power and the frequency used.\nIn \u201cElements of Radio Communication,\u201d by John H. Morecroft, page 98, there is a table shewing the variation according to power. It is there stated that a fifty-watt station will give good service at ten miles, poor service at 100 miles, and interference at 600 miles; a five hundred-watt station will give good service at 30 miles, poor service at 300 miles, and interference at 1,800 miles; and a five thousand-watt station will give good service at 100 miles, poor service at 1,000 miles, and interference at 6,000 miles. At page 76 of the same book it is stated that if frequency is increased, keeping the current constant, more and more energy is radiated until, when the frequency is a million or more, the radiated power may be detected at great distances; and that, for a given current, the power radiated from a given circuit varies as the square of its frequency.\nIt is scarcely necessary to give in detail the extent and importance of the service now rendered to the whole people of this and other countries by radio communication. The broadcasting service is the one most familiar to the masses of the people, and is useful to them as a means of enjoyment, of information and of education. The vast importance to the Dominion as a whole of the coast stations established throughout Canada, and the services that they render to shipping over great distances, as set out in the case, need not be enlarged upon. Of scarcely less importance to the people of all sections of the Dominion is the service by radio communication, which scatters everywhere daily the news of the world and the happenings of the various localities, in which people everywhere are interested; and the service which enables people everywhere to carry on expeditiously business affairs.\nFrom what has been said above, and what further appears in the case, it is evident that all these services by radio communication would be rendered of little practical use to anybody if there were not regulation somewhere by which transmitting stations would be prevented from interfering with each other.\nBy the questions submitted, we are asked to determine whether or not the Dominion Parliament, under the British North America Act, is vested with the general power of dealing with the subject.\nSection 91 of the British North America Act is as follows:\n91. It shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces; and for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms of this section, it is hereby declared that (notwithstanding anything in this Act) the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated; that is to say,\u2014\nThen follows a list of 29 classes of subjects.\nSection 92 reads as follows:\u2014\n92. In each Province the Legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated; that is to say,\u2014\nThen follow 10 enumerated classes of subjects, among which are:\n13. Property and Civil Rights in the Province.\n16. Generally all matters of a merely local or private nature in the province.\nMany disputes have arisen as to the respective jurisdiction of the Dominion and the provinces by virtue of these sections, resulting in many appeals to the Privy Council, in which the construction to be put upon them has been authoritatively laid down. Lord Watson, in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for the Dominion[26], makes the following statement:\u2014\nThese enactments appear to their Lordships to indicate that the exercise of legislative power by the Parliament of Canada, in regard to all matters not enumerated in s. 91, ought to be strictly confined to such matters as are unquestionably of Canadian interest and importance, and ought not to trench upon provincial legislation with respect to any of the classes of subjects enumerated in s. 92.\nViscount Haldane, in Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider[27], states the result of what has been laid down in previous decisions, as follows:\nThe Dominion Parliament has, under the initial words of s. 91, a general power to make laws for Canada. But these laws are not to relate to the classes of subjects assigned to the provinces by s. 92, unless their enactment falls under heads specifically assigned to the Dominion Parliament by the enumeration in s. 91. When there is a question as to which legislative authority has the power to pass an Act, the first question must therefore be whether the subject falls within s. 92. Even if it does, the further question must be answered, whether it falls also under an enumerated head in s. 91. If so, the Dominion has the paramount power of legislating in relation to it. If the subject falls within neither of the sets of enumerated heads, then the Dominion may have power to legislate under the general words at the beginning of s. 91.\nRadio communication is, of course, not specifically mentioned in either of these sections, unless the word \u201cTelegraphs\u201d in s. 92-10 (a) includes it. It is, however, contended, on behalf of the provinces, that it falls within the class of subjects in s. 92 (13), \u201cProperty and Civil Rights in the Provinces,\u201d or no. 16, \u201cGenerally all matters of a merely local or private nature in the Provinces.\u201d\nIt is, of course, conceded on behalf of the provinces that if general jurisdiction is vested in the provinces by virtue of these clauses, that jurisdiction is still subject to any Dominion legislation properly enacted in reference to the classes of subjects specifically assigned to the Dominion Parliament under s. 91 and for the performing of the obligations of Canada or of any province thereof arising under treaties, pursuant to s. 132 of the British North America Act.\nDealing firstly with class no. 16, is it possible, having in view the nature and effect of radio communication, as described, to say that, when carried on in a province, it is a matter of a merely local or private nature in the province? When a transmitter sends out into space these electromagnetic waves, they are projected in all directions for the great distances referred to, and it is not possible for the transmitter to confine them within the bounds of a province. As already pointed out, a transmitter of only fifty-watt power\u2014the power of an ordinary house lamp\u2014will radiate these waves in all directions around it for a distance of 600 miles with sufficient energy at that distance to disturb and interfere with any radio communication passing through that field on the same or nearly the same channel or frequency.\nMr. Lanct\u00f4t, in his argument, pointed out that by the Beam system electro-magnetic waves can in a large measure be prevented from radiating in any but a given direction. This is accomplished by fencing the transmitter behind and at each side by certain apparatus, which results; in limiting largely radiation of waves in these directions, with a consequent diminution of power and distance in those directions, and, apparently, increased power and distance in the remaining direction. He stated that it was possible that these waves so projected in one direction might travel around the world, and in that way come back to the starting point. If his general argument is sound, then every resident of the province of Quebec, and of every other province, has a right at will to send out waves of this or any other character, on any or all channels or frequencies, without limitation or control, unless the province in which the sender resides sees fit by legislation to establish control. The result, if the practice were resorted to to any considerable extent by the residents of the various provinces, would be, as has been pointed out, to destroy the usefulness of radio communication, not only throughout all the provinces, but far beyond the bounds of the Dominion. This, Mr. Lanct\u00f4t argues, is a matter of a merely local or private nature in the province. I am of opinion that it is not a matter of that nature, and that radio communication does not fall within the class of subjects mentioned in this clause 16.\nIs it, then, within the class of subjects described in clause 13, \u201cProperty and Civil Rights in the Province?\u201d It is difficult to conceive of any legislation having a general effect that would not limit or affect in some way an individual\u2019s dominion over his property or over his actions; and if we are to hold that all legislation having this effect deals with property and civil rights in the province, within the meaning of clause 13, then that clause is all-embracing; and notwithstanding the general jurisdiction given to the Dominion Parliament in express terms by s. 91, the practical result would be that, by virtue of this clause 13 of s. 92, the province has general jurisdiction, limited only by the jurisdiction given to the Dominion in reference to the particular classes of subjects enumerated in s. 91.\nCounsel for the provinces disclaimed any intention of arguing for any such extended interpretation of clause 13, and conceded that legislation merely affecting property and civil rights in the province would not necessarily be legislation in connection with that class of subjects. The argument is that a transmitting set and a receiving set are both pieces of property, and that the resident of a province has a right to use such property within the province, and that any legislation by the Dominion that presumes to control or limit his right to such user is legislation in respect of property and civil rights in the province. We are not, however, here dealing with a transmitter or a receiver simply as pieces of property, but are dealing with radio communication by means of these instruments; and it is shewn that the effects of that means of communication cannot be confined within the limits of the province. It is clear that the provinces cannot, by legislation under clause 13, effectively deal with radio communication and so control it as to make that class of service available within the province to any degree of efficiency. No one province can prevent the entrance of these electro-magnetic waves from another province, or in any way eliminate the interference coming from outside the province. The subject can only be dealt with effectively by the Dominion Parliament. The various International conferences and treaties that have been entered into, to which Great Britain and Canada are parties, for the regulation and control of radio communication, in order to make it available and useful to people of all these countries, and the negotiations on the subject still in progress, shew that even the Parliament of Canada is unable of itself to exercise the control and regulation necessary to secure to the Canadian people the full benefits of this recently discovered and marvellous means of communication.\nA good deal has been said as to the importance, to provincial governments, of radio communication for maintaining easy connection with the large areas within their bounds, sparsely inhabited or uninhabited, but containing natural resources of great value, such as timber, requiring supervision, that is greatly facilitated by radio service.\nThis, however, contributes little to the argument, because the object and effect of Dominion legislation on the subject is not to deprive provincial governments and residents of the provinces of radio service, but to secure it to them in a degree of efficiency otherwise unobtainable, by preventing disturbance from bringing about a condition of chaos that the provincial legislatures themselves have not jurisdiction to prevent.\nLegislation by the Dominion Parliament on the subject no doubt affects the use that the resident of a province may make of a piece of property that he owns, namely, a transmitter or a receiver, and may affect what is claimed to be a civil right to use such property within the province, but it is not legislation directly dealing with property and civil rights in the province. It is legislation, in my opinion, dealing with a subject not included in the classes of subjects expressly mentioned in s. 91 or s. 92, which therefore falls within the general jurisdiction assigned to the Dominion Parliament by s. 91.\nIn view of what has just been stated, it becomes unnecessary to discuss the jurisdiction that may be conferred on the Dominion Parliament in reference to. radio communication by s. 92-10 (a). It has been held that the word \u201cTelegraphs\u201d in that subsection includes telephones, though telephones were not invented until several years after the passage of the British North America Act. Attorney-General v. Edison Telephone Company[28]. If this case is authority for holding that radio communications are telegrams, then the jurisdiction over that subject vested in the Dominion Parliament by virtue of this clause (a) may amount, practically, to general, or almost general, jurisdiction, because radio communication connecting a province with any other or others of the provinces, or extending beyond the limits of the province, could not be carried on with any degree of efficiency without controlling the disturbance that would otherwise arise from radio communication within the various provinces.\nI am of opinion that question no. 1 should be answered in the affirmative.\nIt therefore becomes unnecessary to answer question no. 2.\nThe official judgment of the court is as follows:\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014Q. 1. In view of the present state of radio science as submitted, Yes.\nQ. 2. No answer.\nNewcombe J.\u2014Q. 1 should be answered in the affirmative.\nQ. 2. No answer.\nRinfret J.\u2014Q. 1.

In re Charles Dean (48 Can. S.C.R. 235) approved, Lamont J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Newcombe J., in Chambers, dismissing the applications of the two appellants for writs of habeas corpus. The appellants, in a trial before a magistrate on a charge of attempted theft, were convicted and sentenced to three years' imprisonment. They appealed to the Court of Appeal upon the ground inter alia \"that the said sentence (was) excessive\". The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment[1] , ordered that the sentence \"be reduced *** to the term of two years and six months*** .\" The appellants then made an application before Newcombe J. in Chambers for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the term of imprisonment was in excess of the maximum punishment prescribed by law for the offence.\nThe judgment of Newcombe J. was as follows :\nThese two applications coming before me this morning, when it was explained by the prisoners' counsel that each of the prisoners had appealed from his conviction, under the provisions of the Criminal Code, to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, and that the Court had dismissed these appeals, subject to a reduction of the term by six months in each case,\u2014 I reject both applications, upon the view that a judge in British Columbia would have been bound by the law of the case, as interpreted by the provincial Court of Appeal; and that, as my jurisdiction under the Supreme Court Act is concurrent with that of a single judge in British Columbia, I am equally bound, and cannot in this proceeding review the conclusion of the Court of Appeal.\nH. R. Bray for the appellants.\nC. M. O'Brian K.C., for the respondent.\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014I fully concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Rinfret, who holds this court has no jurisdiction because the offences charged exist under the common law independently of the code.\nHowever, had it been competent for us to deal with that aspect of these cases, I would have been disposed to think Mr. Justice Newcombe right, in deferring, as he did, to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia as to the right of the magistrate to impose two years in addition to the six months. I doubt if it would have been competent for any judge in British Columbia to have ignored the judgment of the Court of Appeal dealing with the matter; and, for that reason, I am inclined to think my brother Newcombe right in considering that he was bound thereby. The judgment of Rinfret, Smith and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014The petitioner was arraigned before George Jay, Police Magistrate in and for the district of Victoria, on the 24th day of November, 1930, on the charge that he, at the city of Victoria, in the province of British Columbia,\nbetween, on or about the 8th day of November and the 23rd day of November, 1930, both dates inclusive, did unlawfully attempt to steal the sum of $8,765.33, the moneys of Reginald Pierce, contrary to the Criminal Code.\nThe petitioner consented to be tried before the Police Magistrate on the said charge, pursuant to the provisions contained in Part XVI of the Criminal Code dealing with the summary trial of indictable offences. After hearing evidence and argument, the Police Magistrate found that the petitioner was guilty, that he \"must be convicted on this charge\", and sentenced him to three years' imprisonment, as appears by a true copy of the warrant of commitment attached to the application.\nThe petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia upon several grounds, the most important of which was \"that the said sentence (was) excessive\". The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment,[2] ordered that the sentence\nbe reduced from three years' imprisonment, as set out in the conviction by the Magistrate, to the term of two years and six months *** and as and from the 4th day of December, 1930; and that the appellant be imprisoned for such term.\nWhereupon the petitioner made this application for the issue of a writ of Habeas Corpus ad Subjiciendum on the ground that the term of imprisonment was in excess of the maximum punishment prescribed by law for the offence, and that the jurisdiction of the magistrate in respect thereof was limited to the imposition of a sentence for a term not exceeding six months. Mr. Justice Newcombe, following the view already expressed by Sedgewick, J., in In re Patrick White[3] and by Girouard, J., in In re Chas. Seeley[4] , refused to interfere with the decision of the provincial court of appeal. The petitioner now appeals to the court from the order made by Mr. Justice Newcombe in chambers. At the hearing before the court, counsel for the Crown, in limine, raised the objection that the Supreme Court of Canada, or any of the judges of the court, was without jurisdiction to entertain the present application because, as he contended, the commitment was not \"in a criminal case under any Act of Parliament of Canada\", as required by section 57 of the Supreme Court Act.\nIn In re J. H. Roberts[5] , the present Chief Justice of this Court pointed to the fact that\nboth in its constitution and in its jurisdiction, the Supreme Court is a purely statutory court *** subject to certain qualifications and restrictions specified in *** the Supreme Court Act;\nthat, in habeas corpus matters the jurisdiction of a judge of the court is limited to commitments in criminal cases under an Act of Parliament of Canada and that, except for that purpose,\na judge of this court possesses none of the original powers and is subject to none of the duties in regard to Habeas Corpus of the ordinary courts of common law, whether arising under the common law itself, or conferred by Imperial or Provincial statutes.\nThat view of section 57 of the Act was approved by the full court in Doherty v. Hawthorne[6] , where the decision of Mr. Justice Mignault, based on the judgment in In re Roberts[7] , was unanimously confirmed.\nThe appellant was convicted of the offence of attempt to steal. Stealing or theft was a common law offence. The Criminal Code defines that offence, but it did not create it. An attempt to steal was also a common law offence. (Regina v. McPherson[8].) Every attempt to commit a felony or a misdemeanour was a misdemeanour at common law, whether the crime attempted was one created by statute or at common law. Archbold's Criminal Pleadings, 28th ed., p. 3 And, now, the distinction between felony and misdemeanour has been abolished (Criminal Code, s. 14).\nIn the present case, the magistrate has, in the warrant of commitment, described the offence, of which the prisoner was found guilty, as \"contrary to the Criminal Code\", presumably intending thereby to indicate, in view of section 15, that the offence was one \"liable to be prosecuted and punished under\" the code. Whether or not such was the intention, it does not affect the fact that theft and attempt to steal are not criminal offences by virtue of the Criminal Code. They were criminal offences at common law; and, by force of the Ordinance introducing the Criminal Law of England into British Columbia, they were criminal offences in that colony prior to Confederation and prior to its union with Canada. (See sec. 11 of the Criminal Code).\nThat the jurisdiction of the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada in respect of habeas corpus extends only to offences which are criminal by virtue of statutes of the Parliament of Canada and not to offences which were criminal at common law is, we think, the true effect of section 57 of the Supreme Court Act. (See In re Pierre Poitvin[9] , and In re Robert Evan Sproule[10] , in each of which cases the commitment was for murder). In the Sproule case[11] , we draw particular attention to the reasons at pages 184, 203 and 240.\nIn In re Charles Dean[12] , Mr. Justice Duff, having to deal with an application for habeas corpus in a case of house-breaking, came to the conclusion that he had no jurisdiction; and, speaking of section 57, then section 62, he said:\nThe language indicates an intention on the part of Parliament to confer only a strictly limited jurisdiction. Anything like frequent interposition in the administration of the criminal law in the provinces by the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada, through the instrumentality of the writ of habeas corpus, would obviously lead to the most undesirable results; and, before exercising the authority in a given case, I think it is my duty to scrutinize most carefully the terms in which that authority is given to ascertain whether or not the case is clearly one of those in which it was intended to be exercised.\nThe jurisdiction extends only, I think, to those cases in which the \"commitment\" has followed upon a charge of a criminal offence which is a criminal offence by virtue of some statutory enactment of the Parliament of Canada; it does not, in my opinion, extend to cases in which the \"commitment\" is for an offence which was an offence at common law or under a statute which was passed prior to Confederation and is still in force.\nThe opinion thus enunciated by Mr. Justice Duff sitting in chambers may now be stated as being the opinion of the court. In our view, his judgment is a correct expression of the law, and we approve of it. As a result, in the present case, the objection by counsel for the Crown to the jurisdiction of any judge of this court is well taken ; the application of the petitioner cannot be entertained, and the appeal must be dismissed.\nThis judgment likewise disposes of the appeal on identical grounds from a similar order of Mr. Justice Newcombe in the case of Blackman.\nLAMONT J. (dissenting).\u2014In this case I find myself unable to reach the conclusion arrived at by the other members of the court. The question involved in the appeal is the right of a convicted person on an application for habeas corpus.\nOn the 4th day of December, 1930, the accused in each of the above cases was convicted by George Jay, Police Magistrate in and for the city of Victoria, B.C., for the offence stated in the Blackman warrant of commitment as follows:\nFor that he, the said Jack B. Blackman, between, on or about the 8th day of November, 1930, and the 23rd day of November, 1930, both days inclusive, at the city of Victoria aforesaid, did unlawfully attempt to steal the sum of $8,765.33, the moneys of Reginald Pierce, contrary to the Criminal Code.\nThe accused, in each case, was sentenced to three years' imprisonment.\nContending that the police magistrate had no jurisdiction in a summary trial with the accused's consent, under part 16 of the Criminal Code, to impose, for the offence charged, a sentence of more than six months' imprisonment, the accused appealed to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia. That court reduced the sentence to imprisonment for two years and six months, holding that the police magistrate had jurisdiction to award that sentence.\nBeing still of opinion that the sentence imposed was in excess of the maximum punishment prescribed by law for the offence on summary trial, the accused in each case made an application to Mr. Justice Newcombe of this court for an order that a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum do issue.\nThe application was refused on the following ground :\nI reject both applications, upon the view that a judge in British Columbia would have been bound by the law of the case, as interpreted by the provincial Court of Appeal; and that, as my jurisdiction under the Supreme Court Act is concurrent with that of a single judge in British Columbia, I am equally bound, and cannot in this proceeding review the conclusion of the Court of Appeal. From the refusal of the application the accused appeal to this court.\nThe jurisdiction of a judge of this court on an application for habeas corpus is set out in section 57 of the Supreme Court Act, as follows:\n57. Every judge of the court shall, except in matters arising out of any claim for extradition under any treaty, have concurrent jurisdiction with the courts or judges of the several provinces, to issue the writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment in any criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\n2. If the judge refuses the writ or remands the prisoner, an appeal shall lie to the court.\nTwo questions are before us in this appeal:\n(1) Is a judge of this court who has only concurrent jurisdiction with the courts or judges of the several provinces bound by the views of a provincial court of appeal as to the jurisdiction of a magistrate to impose the sentence which he in fact imposed?\n(2) Where the offence charged is an offence both under the Criminal Code and at common law, but is expressly laid and the commitment made under the Criminal Code, is the commitment made thereunder a commitment in a criminal case under an Act of the Parliament of Canada within the meaning of section 57 of the Supreme Court Act?\nDealing with the first of these questions I incline to the view that the argument on behalf of the accused is sound. That there is considerable authority for the view adopted by my brother Newcombe I admit. That view was taken by Gwynne J. in In re Boucher[13] , where that learned judge said :\nThe decision of the Court of Appeal should be considered conclusive, and should not be interfered with by a single judge of any court sitting in chambers, but the applicant must be left to any recourse he might have against the adjudication of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThis view was also given effect to by Sedgwick J. in In re Patrick White[14] , and by Girouard J. in In re Charles Seely[15] . These views, however reasonable they may be, seem to me to be inconsistent with the judgment of the House of Lords in Cox v. Hakes[16] , where Lord Halsbury, at page 514, said :\nMy Lords, probably no more important or serious question has ever come before your Lordships' House. For a period extending as far back as our legal history, the writ of habeas corpus has been regarded as one of the most important safeguards of the liberty of the subject. If upon the return to that writ it was adjudged that no legal ground was made to appear justifying detention, the consequence was immediate release from custody. If release was refused, a person detained might\u2014see Ex parte Partington[17] , make a fresh application to every judge or every court in turn, and each court or judge was bound to consider the question independently and not to be influenced by the previous decisions refusing discharge. If discharge followed, the legality of that discharge could never be brought in question.\nIn the same case Lord Herschell at page 527, said :\u2014\nIt was always open to an applicant for it, if defeated in one court, at once to renew his application to another. No court was bound by the view taken by any other, or felt itself obliged to follow the law laid down by it. Each court exercised its independent judgment upon the case, and determined for itself whether the return to the writ established that the detention of the applicant was in accordance with the law. A person detained in custody might thus proceed from court to court until he obtained his liberty.\nAgain in Eshugbayi Eleko v. Government of Nigeria[18] , the Privy Council, at page 442, said:\u2014\nIf it be conceded that any judge has jurisdiction to order the writ to issue, then in the view of their Lordships each judge is a tribunal to which application can be made within the meaning of the rule and every judge must hear the application on the merits.\nThe writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum is a prerogative process for securing the liberty of the subject by affording an effective means of immediate release from unlawful or unjustifiable detention, whether in prison or in private custody. It is a prerogative writ by which the King has a right to inquire into the causes for which any of his subjects are deprived of their liberty. 10 Halsbury, 39.\nThe law of England has always been very jealous of any infringement of personal liberty and has been most assiduous in its preservation. In view of the fact that the great object of the writ is to give the person restrained of his liberty an immediate hearing so that the legality of his contention may be inquired into and determined, and in view of the statements contained in the judgments above quoted, I am led to the conclusion that a judge of this court, on an application for a writ of habeas corpus, to inquire into the validity of a commitment by which a person is detained in custody, has cast upon him the duty of determining for himself whether such detention is in accordance with the law. In giving effect to his own view as to the validity of the detention I am unable to see how the judge can be said to be reviewing the conclusion of a provincial court of appeal. He is merely exercising the primary jurisdiction vested in him. This I think is clear from the language of Lord Bramwell in the Cox case[19] , where, at page 523, his Lordship said:\u2014\nI cannot agree that going first to a judge of one court, and then, on being refused by the judge, going to a court, and, on being refused by one court, going to another, was or is an appeal. The court applied to after refusal by a judge or other court was not exercising an appellate jurisdiction in entertaining the application. It was exercising a primary jurisdiction.\nThe concurrent jurisdiction exercised by a judge of this court is jurisdiction to issue the writ for the purpose of inquiring into the validity of the commitment. That such jurisdiction does not oblige him to accept the view of the Court of Appeal in any province is, I think, clear when we consider the position he would be in if the Court of Appeal in some other province had interpreted the sections of the Criminal Code in question in this appeal as meaning something different from the meaning placed upon them by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, and an application were made by the person convicted in each province for a writ of habeas corpus. Could a judge of this court say to the petitioner from one province that the relevant sections of the Code mean one thing in his province, and to the other that the same sections mean, in his province, something entirely different? In my opinion, he could not. It is obvious that the sections of the Code must be construed the same way for all provinces by a judge of this court. This consideration, in my opinion, makes it impossible to hold that he is bound by the construction placed upon the particular sections by any provincial court of appeal.\nSo far as this particular case is concerned the point is not of vital importance because the accused have taken advantage of section 57 (2), above quoted, and have appealed to this court, and no one suggests that this court is bound by the view of the Court of Appeal. Our duty is to state what, in our opinion, is the true interpretation of the sections.\nCounsel for the Crown, however, has raised a preliminary objection to our jurisdiction to pass upon the merits of the appeal. He puts forward the contention that the appellants were not \"committed\" in a criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada. His argument is that the offence of attempting to steal was an offence at common law in British Columbia prior to the enactment of the Criminal Code and that the jurisdiction of a judge of this court, under section 57 of the Supreme Court Act, is limited to cases in which the offence charged was not an offence in the province at common law or under a pre-confederation statute but became a criminal offence solely by virtue of the provisions of an Act of the Parliament of Canada. In support of his contention he cited the following cases: In re Sproule[20] ; In re Roberts[21] ; In re Dean[22] ; and Doherty v. Hawthorne[23] .\nWith reference to these authorities, only one, the Dean case[24] , in my opinion, is in point, although dicta may be found in the others which support the argument.\nThe case of In re Sproule[25] was tried in 1886, before the enactment of the Criminal Code which came into force in 1892. The charge was murder. At the date of the conviction there was no Dominion statute making murder a crime. It was a crime at common law and the common law had been introduced into the province of British Columbia, but the only existing Dominion statute dealing with offences against the person (32 and 33 Vict. c. 20), dealt merely with the punishment and not with the offence. As there was no Act of the Parliament of Canada at that time which made murder a criminal offence there was no jurisdiction in a judge of this court to entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus, as the court held.\nIn the case of In re Roberts[26] the appellant was in custody at Quebec under the authority of a special Act of the legislature for an alleged offence against the privileges, honour and dignity of the provincial legislature of Quebec. It was an offence under a provincial law and, as the present Chief Justice of this court pointed out on an application to him for a writ of habeas corpus, there was\nno ground whatever for suggesting that it was a crime under any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nIn Doherty v. Hawthorne[27] , the petitioner was confined in the common gaol in the county of York, N.B., under a warrant of commitment following his conviction for selling intoxicating liquor contrary to section 56 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act\u2014a provincial statute. He made an application for a writ of habeas corpus to Mr. Justice Mignault of this court, in chambers. That learned judge dismissed the application on the gound that the commitment was made under a provincial statute and not under an Act of the Parliament of Canada and he had, therefore, no jurisdiction. An appeal was taken to this court which affirmed the dismissal of the application for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Mignault.\nNone of these cases, in my opinion, are any authority for the contention made here by counsel for the Crown, for in none of them was the offence, for which the petitioner was committed, a criminal offence under a Dominion statute at the date of the conviction.\nThe case of In re Dean[28], is, however, squarely in point. In that case the petitioner had been tried and convicted of house breaking and committed to gaol. He made an application to my brother Duff in chambers for a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum. My learned brother dismissed the application on the ground that as a judge of this court he had no jurisdiction to entertain the application. He held that the jurisdiction given to a judge of the court by section 57 (then s. 62) of the Supreme Court Act was limited to those cases in which the \"commitment\" has followed upon a charge of a criminal offence which is a criminal offence by virtue of some statute of the Parliament of Canada and did not extend to cases in which the\n\"commitment\" is for an offence which was an offence at common law or under a statute which was passed prior to Confederation and is still in force.\nWith great deference I find myself unable to so construe the language of section 57. To give a judge of this court jurisdiction there must be a \"commitment\" and that commitment must be made in a criminal case under an Act of the Parliament of Canada. That is the language of the section. In this case the appellants were committed. Their commitments followed on a charge of attempting to steal. Attempting to commit theft is an indictable offence under the Criminal Code (ss. 386 and 773) for which an accused person with his consent may be tried summarily. It is also an offence at common law. Section 15 of the Criminal Code provides:\n15. Where an act or omission constitutes an offence, punishable on summary conviction or on indictment, under two or more Acts, or both under an Act and at common law, the offender shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be liable to be prosecuted and punished under either or any of such Acts, or at common law, but shall not be liable to be punished twice for the same offence.\nThis section makes it clear that the appellants might have been prosecuted and punished either at common law or under the Code. Both the charge and the commitment, however, shew that they were prosecuted and convicted for the offence of unlawfully attempting to steal \"contrary to the Criminal Code.\" As the Criminal Code is a Dominion statute I am of opinion that the appellants were committed \"in a criminal case under an Act of the Parliament of Canada.\" The fact that they might have been tried and punished for the offence at common law is, to my mind, immaterial, for they were not so tried and punished. The appellants, therefore, are entitled to have the merits of their appeal determined.\nIn view of the conclusion reached by the other members of the court that we have no jurisdiction to hear this appeal on the merits, it is unnecessary that I should consider the merits at greater length than to say that I find myself in accord with the views expressed by Mr. Justice Martin in his dissenting judgment in the court below, and that the sentence should be reduced to imprisonment for six months.\nAppeals dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellants: H.

Il est exact, comme le soumet l\u2019appelante, qu\u2019elle s\u2019engage seulement \u00e0\nc\u00e9der * * * tous les droits r\u00e9sultant en sa faveur de ses conventions avec les S\u0153urs Dominicaine, (et) \u00e0 intervenir, au besoin, dans un acte de vente des dits lots qui sera pass\u00e9 directement entre les Soeurs Dominicaines et la Corporation de Notre-Dame du Chemin pour c\u00e9der tous ces droits et donner suite aux pr\u00e9sentes;\nmais l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a accept\u00e9 cette convention et ne s\u2019est engag\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cuter que si les titres des immeubles auxquels l\u2019appelante devait c\u00e9der ses droits \u00e9taient\nparfaits et libres de toutes charges et hypoth\u00e8ques, sauf les hypoth\u00e8ques Marois et B\u00e9dard, le tout \u00e0 la satisfaction de la corporation susdite\n(i.e. l\u2019intim\u00e9e). C\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0 la condition de l\u2019acceptation. Si les titres n\u2019\u00e9taient pas \u201cparfaits et libres de toutes charges \u00e0 la satisfaction de\u201d l\u2019intim\u00e9e, il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019acceptation, et il n\u2019y avait pas de contrat.\nLa solution du litige ne d\u00e9pend donc pas, comme l\u2019a pr\u00e9tendu l\u2019appelante, uniquement de la question de savoir si elle serait en \u00e9tat de c\u00e9der ses droits au moment o\u00f9 l\u2019acte de vente interviendrait entre les Soeurs Dominicaines et la corporation intim\u00e9e. L\u2019existence de titres parfaits et libres de toutes charges \u00e9tait une condition essentielle de la formation m\u00eame du contrat entre l\u2019appelante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il n\u2019y a pas \u00e0 se demander qui de l\u2019appelante ou des Soeurs Dominicaines devait fournir des titres parfaits. Il suffit de constater que, au moment requis, les titres n\u2019\u00e9taient ni parfaits, ni libres de toutes charges. Comme cons\u00e9quence, la condition essentielle de \u013eacceptation manquait, et \u013eintim\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait pas engag\u00e9e \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter la convention envers l\u2019appelante.\nD\u2019ailleurs, c\u2019est bien ainsi que l\u2019appelante a compris la situation, puisque, lorsque l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019informa que la communaut\u00e9 des Soeurs Dominicaines avait un tuyau d\u2019aqueduc et un tuyau d\u2019\u00e9gout qui traversaient la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, qu\u2019elle entendait les maintenir et qu\u2019elle ne voulait pas consentir de titre de vente sans\nse r\u00e9server le droit de maintenir ces tuyaux et de vaquer sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour les r\u00e9parer ou renouveler au besoin,\nl\u2019appelante fit r\u00e9pondre par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de son notaire qu\u2019elle verrait\n\u00e0 ce que les titres de ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s soient rendus conformes \u00e0 (l\u2019) engagement du 26 juin 1929, devant le notaire Laurent Lesage,\nc\u2019est-\u00e0-dire au contrat dont il s\u2019agit. Il n\u2019appara\u00eet nulle part au dossier que l\u2019appelante ait donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 cette r\u00e9ponse.\nIl est douteux que l\u2019appelante e\u00fbt droit \u00e0 un d\u00e9lai pour rendre les titres parfaits. L\u2019intim\u00e9e pouvait s\u2019autoriser du fait que les titres n\u2019\u00e9taient pas libres de toutes charges pour consid\u00e9rer qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9e envers l\u2019appelante et pour traiter la convention avec cette derni\u00e8re comme n\u2019ayant jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9e, vu que la condition de \u013eacceptation n\u2019\u00e9tait pas remplie.\nMais, comme on peut le constater par les plaidoiries \u00e9crites, l\u2019appelante admet que, le, ou vers le, 8 juillet 1929, elle a notifi\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e qu\u2019elle \u201cn\u2019entendait pas r\u00e9silier le dit contrat\u201d. Cela justifiait la demande en annulation du contrat (Desjardins v. Corbeil)[1].\nL\u2019appelante ajoute que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi ont fait erreur \u201cquant \u00e0 la nature et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tendue des r\u00e9serves faites par l\u2019intim\u00e9e\u201d.\nCette derni\u00e8re acqu\u00e9rait de l\u2019appelante les droits qu\u2019elle d\u00e9tenait sur le lot 218A et sur la tranche additionnelle de cinquante pieds sur toute la lageur du lot 218. Elle acqu\u00e9rait le r\u00e9sidu du lot 218 directement des Soeurs Dominicaines. Or, l\u2019appelante dit que, au moment du contrat du 26 juin 1929, les trois sections de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui devaient faire l\u2019objet de l\u2019acquisition appartenaient toutes les trois aux Soeurs Dominicaines et qu\u2019il ne pouvait donc exister alors aucune servitude, puisque nulle servitude ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie sur des immeubles appartenant \u00e0 un seul propri\u00e9taire.\nCet argument de l\u2019appelante trouve sa r\u00e9ponse dans Pothier (Bugnet, 3e \u00e9d, vol. 1, p. 321, sous l\u2019article 228):\nLorsque deux h\u00e9ritages appartiennent au m\u00eame ma\u00eetre, le service que \u013eun tire de l\u2019autre, comme lorsqu\u2019une maison a une vue ou un \u00e9go\u00fbt sur l\u2019autre, n\u2019est pas servitude, quis res sua nemini servit; L. 26, ff de Servit, pr. rust. C\u2019est destination du p\u00e8re de famille. Si par la suite ces maisons viennent \u00e0 appartenir \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents ma\u00eetres, soit par l\u2019ali\u00e9nation que le propri\u00e9taire fera de l\u2019une de ces maisons, ou par le partage qui se fera entre ses h\u00e9ritiers, le service que l\u2019une des maisons tire de l\u2019autre, qui \u00e9tait destination de p\u00e8re de famille, lorsqu\u2019elles appartenaient \u00e0 un m\u00eame ma\u00eetre, devient un droit de servitude que le propri\u00e9taire de cette maison a sur la maison voisine de qui la sienne tire ce service, sans qu\u2019il soit besoin que par l\u2019ali\u00e9nation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite de \u013eune de ces deux maisons, ou par le partage, cette servitude ait \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment constitu\u00e9e.\nLa raison est que la maison qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ali\u00e9n\u00e9e est cens\u00e9e l\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 en l\u2019\u00e9tat qu\u2019elle se trouvait et pareillement que lorsqu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 partag\u00e9es, elles sont cens\u00e9es l\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 telles et en l\u2019\u00e9tat qu\u2019elles se trouvaient; et par cons\u00e9quent l\u2019une comme ayant la vue, l\u2019\u00e9gout, etc. sur l\u2019autre, et l\u2019autre comme souffrant cette vue, cet \u00e9gout, etc. ce qui suffit pour \u00e9tablir la servitude. C\u2019est ce que signifie notre coutume par ces termes: destination de p\u00e8re de famille vaut titre.\nConform\u00e9ment au principe pos\u00e9 par Pothier, il y avait donc, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, une destination de p\u00e8re de famille, qui pouvait servir de titre \u00e0 une servitude d\u2019aqueduc et d\u2019\u00e9gout, et qui devenait un droit de servitude d\u00e8s que les deux parties de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 cessaient d\u2019appartenir au m\u00eame propri\u00e9taire. C\u2019est ce droit de servitude que les Soeurs Dominicaines d\u00e9claraient se r\u00e9server. Il restait \u00e0 en sp\u00e9cifier \u201cla nature, l\u2019\u00e9tendue et la situation\u201d, suivant l\u2019article 551 du code civil, et c\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce qu\u2019elles entendaient \u00e9tablir dans la r\u00e9serve qu\u2019elles voulaient faire.\nJe suis donc d\u2019accord avec mon coll\u00e8gue, monsieur le Juge Duff, pour dire que \u201cthe charge complained of appears to be within the scope of the condition\u201d et pour conclure avec lui au rejet de l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cannon & Cannon.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Antonio Langiais.\n[1] [1930] Q.R. 49, \u041aB. 162\n"}

S. [1922] c. 133. If under the terms of a written promise to pay a sum of money the obligation may be discharged in part or in full by \"allowing credit (to the debtor) for any land sales commissions\", such promise is not an unconditional one to pay a sum certain; and, therefore, the document is not a promissory note.\nSections 101, 102 and 103 of the Alberta Land Titles Act, relative to transfer of mortgages, have no application where the mortgagor's interest in the land has disappeared before transfer and there remains nothing but the personal responsibility of the mortgagor arising under covenant or otherwise.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Tweedie J. and dismissing the appellant's action with costs.\nThe appellant's claim is against the respondent as the maker of a certain promissory note dated the 1st day of December, 1925, to the order of the Standard Trusts Company of Winnipeg in the sum of $1,641.70 payable on or before the 1st day of December, 1928, together with interest thereon at the rate of 7% per annum. The defence inter alia denies the making of the promissory note. On the argument before the Appellate Division, for the first time, objection was taken that the note sued on was not a promissory note and that, therefore, the appellant could not succeed on its statement of claim. The document sued upon is: \"A5019\n$1641.70\/100\nDecember 1st 1925\nNO\u2026.\nOn or before Dec. 1st 1928 after date, for value received, I promise to pay to the order of\nTHE STANDARD TRUSTS COMPANY, at Winnipeg, Sixteen hundred and forty-one 70\/100 Dollars.

Rose\"\n\"Peter LaValley\"\nThe material facts of the case are stated by Harvey, C.J.A., as follows:\u2014\nIn 1909 the defendant bought some land from the O. W. Kerr Co., an American company. Later payment of the unpaid balance of purchase price was arranged by the plaintiff advancing $6,600 on a first mortgage from the defendant and the O. W. Kerr Company taking a second mortgage for the balance. Nothing was ever paid on the second mortgage. Owing to failure of crops the plaintiff's mortgage fell into arrears and foreclosure proceedings were taken resulting in the foreclosure of the second mortgage and the defendant's equity and a vesting order issued to the plaintiffs in December, 1915. The defendant then leased the land and in 1916 he had a valuable crop and in December, 1916, he entered into an agreement with the plaintiff to purchase the land for $8,000. The purchase price was all paid before the end of 1917. After he had paid all the money, but before he had received a transfer, the plaintiff's manager, informed him that the plaintiff had purchased the O. W. Kerr Co. second mortgage and asked him for a mortgage on the land to secure the amount due under it. The upshot was that a note for $2,000 was given dated 1st November, 1917, payable on 1st December, 1918, with interest at 7%. The document sued on represents the amount of that $2,000 and interest remaining unsatisfied on December 1, 1925.\nH. R. Milner, K.C., for the appellant.\nA. M. Sinclair, K.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014There is no ground upon which the decision of the Appellate Division that the document sued is not a promissory note, can successfully be impugned.\n(After discussing the proceedings the learned judge added.)\nThere will be a new trial. The costs of all appeals as well as of the abortive trial will abide the result of the new trial; and all parties will have full liberty to amend and the right to discovery in respect of the amended pleadings, subject of course to the directions of the Supreme Court of Alberta. It seems convenient to express now our view that sections 101, 102 and 103 of the Land Titles Act have no application where the mortgagor's interest in the land has disappeared before transfer, and there remains nothing but the personal responsibility of the mortgagor arising under covenant or otherwise.\nAppeal allowed, new trial ordered.\n[1] (1930) 25 Alta.

Walker, [1931] S.C.R. 597\nDate: 1931-06-12\nAlbert Lund (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nHarrington Walker (Defendant) Respondent.\n1931: May 22; 1931: June 12.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe, Rinfret, Smith and Cannon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nAppeal\u2014Right of\u2014Order \u201cmade with the consent of parties\u201d (Judicature Act, Ont., R.S.O., 1927, c. 88, s. 23)\u2014Exclusion of evidence at trial\u2014New trial.\nIn the course of a trial (and after the trial judge had ruled out certain evidence which plaintiff was offering) plaintiff\u2019s counsel expressed a wish to have the record withdrawn on plaintiff undertaking to pay costs. In the course of the discussion which followed, defendant\u2019s counsel remarked \u201cI cannot consent to anything but the dismissal with costs\u201d (which was all defendant could get if successful in the action), but his attitude throughout was against defendant being a party to any settlement, his insistence being on dismissal with costs as a matter of right. The trial judge endorsed the record: \u201cThis action is dismissed with costs,\u201d and added, as requested by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, \u201cby consent of the plaintiff.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel then asked for and got permission to take out his exhibits. The formal judgment recited: \u201cand the plaintiff by his counsel consenting,\u201d but was silent as to consent by defendant.\nHeld (Anglin C.J.C. and Cannon J. dissenting): The judgment was not an order \u201cmade with the consent of parties,\u201d within the meaning of s. 23 of the Ontario Judicature Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 88, and plaintiff was not precluded by that section from appealing from the judgment. Judgment of the Appellate Division, Ont., on this point (65 Ont. L.R. 53) sustained.\nA judgment by consent within s. 23 is a judgment determining an issue between parties to the litigation with the consent of the parties to the issue so determined. It is only when the \u201cparties\u201d consent that the right of appeal is taken away. It is not for the court to extend the scope of the section so as to deprive a litigant of a right to appeal unless he comes within the express language of the Act.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Cannon J. (dissenting): The judgment was a consent judgment. Defendant\u2019s counsel must be taken to have consented to it, having regard to its effect, and to what took place in the discussion at the trial. The authority of counsel to consent may be assumed; it would not have been competent for the Appellate Division (nor for this Court) to pass upon that question; the fact that the judgment of the trial court had been formally completed distinguishes this case from Shepherd v. Robinson, [1919] 1 K.B. 474, and Neale v. Gordon Lennox, [1902] A.C. 465, and similar cases; once a final judgment by consent has been formally drawn up, signed, sealed and entered, as here, unless by agreement of the parties, it may be set aside only in a fresh action brought for that purpose; especially must that be so where such an issue as consent or no consent must be decided on controversial evidence. (Harrison v. Rumsey, 2 Vesey Sr. 488; Ainsworth v. Wilding, [1896] 1 Ch. 673; Firm of R.M.K. R.M. v. Firm of M.R.M. V.L., [1926] A.C. 761, at 771; Kemp-Welch v. Kemp-Welch et al., [1912] P. 82; Kinch v. Walcott, [1929] A.C. 482, cited). The fact that the judgment does not show on its face the explicit consent of the defendant (who got by it all he could get in the action), or the fact that his consent was not formally given, does not prevent its being a consent judgment. (Hadida v. Fordham, 10 T.L.R. 139; Holt v. Jesse, 3 Ch. D. 177, and other cases referred to). The statement, as to what constitutes consent, in Daniell\u2019s Chancery Practice, 8th Ed., p. 1110, discussed and explained in the light of the cases there cited (Davis v. Chanter, 2 Phillips, 545; Aldam v. Brown, [1890] W.N. 116; Hadida v. Fordham, supra); Annual Practice (1929) at p. 2141, (1930) at p. 2139, (1931) at p. 2139, also referred to and discussed in this connection.\nHeld further (unanimously) that, on the merits (which were argued, subject to determination of the other question), there should be a new trial, as one of the grounds on which the trial judge ruled out certain evidence was clearly wrong and would have the effect of preventing the plaintiff (who had other witnesses yet to be called) from offering further evidence on matters on which he was entitled to adduce evidence; under all the circumstances, plaintiff should be given an opportunity to place all his evidence before the court. Judgment of the Appellate Division, Ont., on this question (38 Ont. W.N. 122) reversed.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, which, while holding that the judgment of Logie J. dismissing the action was not an order \u201cmade with the consent of parties\u201d within the meaning of s. 23 of the Ontario Judicature Act, R.S.O., 1927, c. 88, and therefore that the plaintiff was not precluded by that section from bringing his appeal[1], yet held that, on the merits, the plaintiff\u2019s appeal should, as against the present respondent, be dismissed[2]. In the action, the plaintiff claimed (inter alia) a declaration that the defendant Walker (the present respondent) was a trustee for the plaintiff of certain shares of stock in a company, and that the sale and transfer of the said shares made by plaintiff to said defendant was null and void and that the same be cancelled. The issues now in question arose out of certain proceedings at the trial. These are described in the judgments now reported, and are indicated in the above head-note; and the discussion leading up to the pronouncement of the judgment at the trial is quoted in full in the Court below, when dealing with the question of whether or not the judgment at trial was a \u201cconsent judgment\u201d[3]. The trial judge endorsed the record: \u201cBy consent of the plaintiff this action is dismissed with costs.\u201d The formal judgment at trial (which is also quoted in the Court below[4]), dismissing the action with costs, contained the recital: \u201cand the plaintiff by his counsel consenting,\u201d but was silent as to consent by defendant.\nBy the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, now reported, the plaintiff\u2019s appeal was allowed, and a new trial ordered; the costs of the abortive trial to be in the discretion of the judge who will preside at the new trial, and the costs of the appeal to this Court and in the Appellate Division to be costs to the appellant in the cause. Anglin C.J.C. and Cannon J. dissented, on the ground that the judgment at trial was a consent judgment and therefore non-appealable.\nW.N. Tilley K.C. for the appellant.\nGlyn Osler K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Newcombe, Rinfret and Smith JJ.) was delivered by\nSMITH J.\u2014The (defendant) respondent Walker, when holding appellant\u2019s 250 shares in the capital stock of Hiram Walker & Sons, Limited (also a defendant in the action) in trust to sell or dispose of them in the same way as he should dispose of his own in a contemplated sale of the business of the company, bought the shares himself. The fiduciary relationship existing between the parties imposed on the respondent the duty of making full disclosure of all facts within his knowledge, unknown to the appellant, affecting the value of the shares.\nThe appellant was a director of the company residing in England, and the respondent was also a director and the president of the company. The appellant brought this action to have the sale of his 250 shares to respondent set aside on the ground that in his absence and without his knowledge some assets of the company had been concealed and not accounted for, and others transferred to the respondent, his brother and others, at less than their value, and that products of the company had been sold at a low price and resold at a profit, the respondent sharing in these profits; all of which transactions, it is alleged, affected the value of the shares.\nAt the trial the appellant\u2019s counsel called as a witness one Nash, a member of a firm of chartered accountants that had, on behalf of the Dominion Government, investigated the affairs of the company. He declined to give evidence as to the affairs of the company, because the Department of Customs and Excise objected on the ground of public interest to the disclosure of information obtained in this way. After considerable discussion, the learned trial judge gave his final and decisive ruling, as follows: \u201cI refuse it on two grounds: first, that it is against public policy, secondly, that we are not here enquiring into the private affairs of the company, which has been definitely stayed by an order of the Master. Next witness.\u201d Counsel for appellant had pointed out that he was offering this evidence in support of the allegation in the pleadings of wrongful dealings with the property and assets of the company not disclosed to him by respondent.\nThe first ground for the ruling, that is, public policy, affected only the particular witness Nash, but the second ground applies to all witnesses that might be called because the allegations of non-disclosure could only be proved by going into the private affairs of the company. The ruling therefore effectively prevented the appellant from offering further evidence of alleged wrongful dealing with the company property and assets, and was clearly wrong. At the conclusion of the argument before us, the Chief Justice intimated that a new trial would be ordered unless it should be determined that the appellant had no right of appeal because the judgment was a consent judgment within the meaning of section 23 of the Judicature Act, which point was reserved.\nFor the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Masten[5], concurred in by the Chief Justice and Orde and Fisher, JJ.A., I am of opinion that it was not a consent judgment within the meaning of section 23, which reads as follows:\u2014\nNo order of the High Court Division or of a Judge thereof made with the consent of parties shall be subject to appeal, and no order of the High Court Division or of a Judge thereof as to costs only which by law are left to the discretion of the Court shall be subject to appeal on the ground that the discretion was wrongly exercised, or that it was exercised under a misapprehension as to the facts or the law or on any other ground, except by leave of the court or judge making the order.\nCounsel for the appellant asked for a judgment by consent, but counsel for respondent absolutely refused to be a party to a consent judgment, and protested to the end against such a judgment. He stood out to the last for what he claimed as his client\u2019s right, namely, a dismissal of the action, with costs, on the merits. Charges had been made in the pleadings against the defendant, and what Mr. Osler evidently desired was a vindication of his client, not by a consent judgment, but by a dismissal of the action by the Court on the merits.\nThe learned trial judge endorsed the record as follows: \u201cThis action is dismissed with costs.\u201d Then the learned judge said to plaintiff\u2019s counsel, \u201cIf you like, I will add the words \u2018by consent of the plaintiff\u2019\u201d; and plaintiff\u2019s counsel replied, \u201cThat is what I ask, my Lord.\u201d His Lordship remarked, \u201cWell, there is no harm in that that I see,\u201d and added the words \u201cBy consent of the plaintiff,\u201d to the endorsement. It was clearly a consent by one party only.\nA judgment by consent within the meaning of the section is a judgment determining an issue between parties to the litigation with the consent of the parties to the issue so determined. The word \u201cparties\u201d is in the plural, and, as Mr. Justice Masten points out, it is only when the \u201cparties\u201d consent that the right of appeal is taken away. It is not for the court to extend the scope of the section so as to deprive a litigant of the right which he has to appeal unless he comes within the express language of the statute as it stands.\nWhile the above result is arrived at without regard to the affidavits filed, it may be noted that these affidavits were to the effect that the judgment entered was not in fact by consent of the plaintiff.\nThere must be a new trial, in the terms set out in the reasons of the Chief Justice.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. and Cannon J. (dissenting) was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The plaintiff appeals from the affirmance by the Second Appellate Divisional Court (Ontario)[6] of the judgment entered at the trial of this action (in so far as it affects the defendant Harrington E. Walker) which dismissed the action with costs \u201cby consent of the plaintiff.\u201d In so far as this judgment might operate in favour of the other defendants, Hiram Walker & Sons, Limited and C. W. Isaacs, as to whom the action had been stayed by orders competently made, and who were, therefore, not before the learned trial judge, it was pronounced per incuriam; and the necessary correction was made by the Appellate Court, so that the action stands as against these two defendants, and the judgment dismissing it is now confined in its operation to the defendant Harrington E. Walker.\nThe judgment in favour of Harrington E. Walker was attacked on two grounds,\u2014\nFirst, that it was not a \u201cconsent judgment\u201d within the meaning of Section 23 of the Ontario Judicature Act (R.S.O., 1927, c. 88) and,\nSecond, that the consent, on which the order purported to have been made, was given by his counsel contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s express instructions. In dealing with the first point, the authority of counsel to consent may be assumed. Indeed, I more than doubt the competency of the Appellate Divisional Court to have passed upon that question\u2014which indeed, it did not do. The fact that the judgment of the trial court had been formally completed distinguishes this case from Shepherd v. Robinson[7], and Neale v. Gordon Lennox[8]. In the former case, the order had not been drawn up; and, in the latter, before the order was drawn up, steps had been taken to set it aside, as appears from the statement of facts, at p. 467 of the report. In Neale v. Gordon Lennox[9], Lord Lindley pointed out that, before the order had been drawn up,\none of the parties interested discovers that it is made without her consent at all, and not only without her consent, but in spite of her express instructions. * * * Unfortunately the plaintiff here wishing to get rid of the order drew it up with the view of getting it set aside, and in form this is an application, not to prevent the drawing up of the order, but to have it set aside; but that is mere form\u2014mere machinery.\nAs pointed out by the Earl of Halsbury, L.C. (at the foot of p. 469), in effect, in that case, the defendant sought the assistance of the court to enforce the order\u2014\nThe Court is asked for its assistance when this order is asked to be made and enforced that the trial of the cause should not go on;\nand it was \u00e0-propos of that fact that Lord Lindley said (p. 473),\nIt would be absolutely wrong, to my mind, for the Court to allow that order to be acted on and to take effect the moment it is judicially ascertained and brought to its attention that it is an order which the Court never would have dreamt of making if the Court had known the facts.\nIn a number of other similar cases, i.e., where the judgment has not actually been completed by signature, sealing and entry, the court has dealt with it, although it appeared to have been pronounced by consent, and has set it aside on the ground that, in reality, it was not a consent judgment.\nBut, once a final judgment by consent has been formally drawn up, signed, sealed and entered, as here, unless by agreement of the parties, it may be set aside only in a fresh action brought for that purpose; especially must that be so where such an issue as consent or no consent must be decided on controversial evidence. (Harrison v. Rumsey[10]; Ainsworth v. Wilding[11]; Firm of R.M.K.R.M. v. Firm of M.R.M.V.L.[12]; Kemp-Welch v. Kemp-Welch et al.[13]; Kinch v. Walcott[14]. Of course, in an action brought for that purpose, a judgment based upon consent, though formally completed, may be set aside on any ground which would suffice to set aside an agreement between the parties in the terms of such judgment, including mistake. (Wilding v. Sanderson[15]; Hickman v. Berens[16]; Lewis\u2019s v. Lewis[17]). Many other authorities might be cited for this proposition.\nProceeding, therefore, on the assumption that counsel had the usual authority to give the consent in question, the other ground of attack must be considered; and I am quite prepared to concede that it was entirely within the jurisdiction of the Appellate Divisional Court to deal with that aspect of the appeal before it, but regret to find myself unable to concur in its conclusion thereupon.\nIn the first place, the judgment in question gave to the defendant all he could possibly expect in the action,\u2014all he could possibly be entitled to, viz., a dismissal with costs, which he asked for impliedly, if not expressly, in his statement of defence. It is not at all surprising to find his counsel (Mr. Osler), in the course of the brief discussion, which resulted in the entry of the judgment in question, saying:\nMr. OSLER: I cannot consent to anything but the dismissal with costs.\nMr. GRANT (who appeared for the plaintiff): Well, I will consent to a dismissal with costs, if we can\u2019t get any other terms.\nMr. Osler, it is true, subsequently stated that he did not wish his client to be put in the position of appearing to consent to anything, because his consent might later be used against him as implying a desire, on his part, to be rid, at any cost, of the action and of the charges involved in it rather than have them publicly tried; Mr. Walker\u2019s attitude was quite the reverse. But, from a perusal of the short conversation which ensued between counsel and the presiding judge, I am entirely satisfied that he (Mr. Osler) never intended to withdraw from the position he took when he said, \u201cI cannot consent to anything but the dismissal with costs,\u201d thus, impliedly, stating to the court, \u201cI am prepared to consent to that order being made,\u201d which was immediately followed by the statement of Mr. Grant, above quoted, \u201cWell, I will consent to a dismissal with costs, if we can\u2019t get any other terms.\u201d Eventually (and this was the only departure from the judgment \u201cdismissing the action with costs\u201d simpliciter, to which Mr. Osler had certainly consented\u2014a departure pressed for to the point of insistence by Mr. Grant), the learned judge merely added to his minute of the judgment, at Mr. Grant\u2019s specific request, the words, \u201cby consent of the plaintiff,\u201d observing at the same time, \u201cWell, there is no harm in that that I see.\u201d Whereupon Mr. Osler, apparently acquiescing in that view and accepting the order, said, \u201cMy Lord, may we have our exhibits out\u201d\u2014and he took his exhibits out shortly afterwards. If the judgment then pronounced be not a consent judgment binding on the plaintiff, I do not understand what a consent judgment is.\nTo say it is not a consent judgment because it does not show on its face the explicit consent of the defendant, who got by it all he could possibly ask for in the action, seems to me to ignore the authorities, to the effect that the form of a judgment is not necessarily binding upon the court and may be gone behind for the purpose of ascertaining the true facts, in order to determine whether or not there actually was a \u201cconsent judgment,\u201d when that question is properly raised before the court. These authorities are, amongst others, Neale v. Gordon Lennox[18]; Michel v. Mutch[19], and Darley (Trustee of Baines) v. Tulley[20].\nIf a plaintiff, having (as occurred here) by his counsel, apparently clothed with authority to do so, consented to a judgment dismissing his action with costs (that being the greatest relief the defendant could get, and there being no counterclaim, nor any issue in the action other than one of liability of the defendant to the plaintiff) can, nevertheless, solemnly come into court and be heard to say that he has not consented to the judgment, and that it is not binding on him as a consent judgment, although, on the face of it, it purports to have been made by his consent, the obser- vation of the Vice-Chancellor in Holt v. Jesse[21] would seem to me to be very much in point, when he said: That is tantamount to giving\na general licence to parties to come to this Court and deliberately to give their consent, and afterwards at their will and pleasure come and undo what they did inside the Court, because on a future day they find they do not like it.\nIt does strike me as rather absurd to ask that, in order to make a judgment a consent judgment, assent to its terms by the party in whose favour that judgment is pronounced (which accords to him, as it does, everything he could expect to get in the action) should necessarily be formally given or should appear on the face of the judgment. Hadida v. Fordham[22], and Holt v. Jesse[23], I may refer to as two cases, amongst the many I have examined, in which the orders on their face appeared to show consent only by the party adversely affected by them. Thus, in Hadida v. Fordham22 which, the reporter says, \u201cillustrates the danger of giving an undertaking in place of allowing a hostile order for an injunction to be made in case of a possible appeal,\u201d the only reference to consent in the order was to be found in the fact that \u201cthe defendants\u2019 counsel submitted to give an undertaking not to use\u201d a certain word objected to by the plaintiff. An appeal from the order was taken by the defendant. The appeal, however, was summarily dismissed, the view expressed by the Court of Appeal being that the order, except so far as costs were concerned (as to which there had been a trial), amounted to a consent order; and there could be no appeal from a consent order.\nIn Holt v. Jesse[24], an application was made to the judge who had pronounced it to discharge an order to which a consent had been given by counsel, in the presence of, and with the sanction of his client to its terms, which included the following: \u201cthe defendant, by his counsel, submitting to account.\u201d In disposing of the motion the Vice-Chancellor said that \u201cunder those circumstances, the order was treated as a consent order.\u201d The motion to discharge it was, accordingly, refused, notwithstanding the fact that, before the order had been drawn up or entered, the client had changed his mind and withdrawn his consent. In neither case is there anything in the report of the case to indicate that any consent had been given by counsel for the plaintiff, in whose favour the order had gone, to its being made in the form it took. No doubt, upon further search, other similar instances could be found in the reports; but these two would seem to suffice for the present. (See also Levi v. Taylor[25].)\nAccordingly, the consent of the party against whom the judgment, now before us, is made would seem to be all that is necessary. Yet, it is the very party who so consented, who is here seeking to appeal, after having given his consent. As put by Riddell J.A.[26],\nInfluenced, rightly or wrongly, by the strenuous pressure of the plaintiff through his counsel, the Judge finally directed that the judgment should go dismissing the action by the consent of the plaintiff.\nTo quote the language of Lord Cottenham in Davis v. Chanter[27], such a party should be told: \u201cYou complain of the court having done what you asked it to do.\u201d In my opinion, upon that fact becoming apparent, he should not be further heard.\nFor these reasons, I am, with deference, of the opinion that the judgment in question was really a \u201cconsent judgment\u201d within the meaning of the language of Section 23 of the Ontario Judicature Act, and that the court has no jurisdiction to set it aside, except in a fresh action brought for that purpose. It follows, in my opinion, that the appeal now before this court should be dismissed with costs.\nTo appreciate the distinction between the preposition \u201cwith,\u201d in the context in which it is found in Section 23 of the Ontario Judicature Act, and the prepositions \u201con\u201d and \u201cupon,\u201d in a like context, made by Mr. Justice Riddell, with the utmost respect for that very able judge, requires a subtlety and finesse of intellect of which I freely confess myself incapable.\nThe following passage, however, from the judgment of the learned judge who wrote for the majority on this question appears to call for some further observation. We find him saying[28]: (Section 31 of the Judicature Act of 1925). \u201cNo appeal shall lie, without the leave of the Court or Judge making the order, from an order of the High Court or any Judge thereof made with the consent of the parties.\u201d\nReferring to that provision, it is said in Daniell\u2019s Chancery Practice, 8th Ed., p. 1110: \u201cTo constitute consent there must be a bargain between the parties, and not a mere acceptance of the order offered.\u201d In the Annual Practice of 1929, at p. 2141, the result of the cases is expressed in identically the same terms, and in support of the statement there is quoted the following cases: Davis v. Chanter[29]; Aldam v. Brown[30]; Hadida v. Fordham and Sons Ltd.[31] I have perused and considered these cases, and they appear to me to bear out the conclusion expressed in the text books.\nIt is true that, in Daniell\u2019s Chancery Practice, 8th Ed., p. 1110, the language quoted is found. The significance of the passage, however, can best be ascertained by looking at the authorities cited in support of it which are those mentioned by the learned judge. It is obvious that the author meant no more than this, that, where an election is offered to a party by the court, his acceptance of an order, couched in what he regards as the least onerous of alternative terms proposed, does not amount to an acquiescence in, or consent to, those terms. Thus, in Davis v. Chanter[32], Lord Cottenham, then Lord Chancellor, said that\nAn order that a cause shall stand over with liberty to amend by adding parties is as much an adjudication as far as it goes as any other. The Court says, I cannot give you relief unless you do a certain thing. Is the plaintiff to ask the Court to dismiss the bill? If so, what is he to say when he comes here on appeal? He would be told, you complain of the Court having done what you asked it to do.\nAnd the order was held not to be binding as a consent order upon the appellant merely because he had accepted an alternative offered him by the court.\nThe next case referred to is Aldam v. Brown[33]. In this case the plaintiff was offered the alternative of having an account and enquiry taken, or having his action dismissed. The report reads,\nThe plaintiff elected to take this account and enquiry rather than have the action dismissed. The judgment, after the usual reference to the pleadings, evidence and argument, proceeded: \u201cAnd the plaintiff by his counsel accepting an enquiry and account in the form hereinafter directed, this Court doth order, etc.\u201d The plaintiff appealed.\nThe Court of Appeal held that an appeal would lie because the order could not be looked upon as a consent order, the plaintiff having merely taken the less objectionable alternative offered him by the court.\nThe third case cited is Hadida v. Fordham[34], above referred to, where the order, against which the defendant appealed, stated his submission to give an undertaking not to use a word objected to by the plaintiff. Far from being an authority for the appellant, in the present instance, as I read the report of this case, it is distinctly against him, the court having there dismissed the appeal on the ground that the appellant (defendant), by submitting to the undertaking, as he did, had given his consent to the order made and could not be heard to object to it on appeal.\nWhen, however, I look at the reference in the Annual Practice (1929), p. 2141, I find the passage relied on by the learned judge reads as follows:\nTo constitute consent, there must be a bargain between the parties, not mere acceptance by the appellant of an order offered by the court.\nThe same words are to be found in the Annual Practice for 1930 and for 1931, at p. 2139 in each volume. It is, perhaps, significant that the first case cited by Daniell in his book is not referred to, reference being made merely to Aldam v. Brown33 and Hadida v. Fordham34. Here, the case is not one of mere acceptance by the appellant of an order offered by the court, but rather there was pressure by his counsel at the trial amounting to insistence, yielded to by the learned judge, to give the very judgment which he pronounced.\nI understand, however, that the majority of my brethren take the opposite view on the aspect of the case now under consideration and are prepared to hold that, because the formal consent of the defendant does not appear on the face of the order, and because his counsel took the stand that he did not wish it to appear that he was consenting for the reason above stated, although immediately upon the judgment being pronounced he asked and got permission to withdraw his exhibits from the court (a permission on which he acted), that the judgment formally entered, dismissing this action \u201cby consent of the plaintiff,\u201d cannot be regarded as a \u201cconsent judgment\u201d within the meaning of section 23 of the Ontario Judicature Act, and that the plaintiff is not bound thereby, but is entirely at liberty to appeal therefrom.\nHaving regard to this conclusion of the majority, it is unnecessary for me to express any opinion on the further point discussed as to the proper construction of section 23, i.e., as to whether or not the concluding phrase thereof applies only to its immediate antecedent, viz., a discretionary order dealing with costs, or whether its application extends to the whole section, so as to enable \u201cthe court or judge making\u201d an order by consent to give leave to appeal therefrom. Were I required to pass upon that question, I should be inclined to take the view expressed by Mr. Justice Riddell, viz., that the proper construction of this clause, as it now stands, in the statute is that leave to appeal of the court or a judge making the order may be given only where the order, so far as sought to be appealed from, deals merely with costs, and may not be given where, as here, the \u201cjudgment by consent\u201d deals with the substance of the action.\nMoreover, although that learned judge refrained from determining whether or not the appeal should be stayed to ascertain whether the appellant could obtain the leave of the trial judge to appeal, I have no hesitation whatever in saying, that, in my opinion, any such application should be refused, having regard to the improbability and, possibly, the impropriety of the trial judge,\nafter yielding to the urgent pressure of the plaintiff and against the will of the defendant, and directing the judgment to be entered as the plaintiff wished it in a form against which the defendant protested to the last, then, on the request of the party who had induced him to direct judgment to be entered as on his consent, giving leave to him to appeal from the judgment he had asked for. * * * This would savor of absurdity and great unfairness to the party upon whom the judgment was, at the instance of the appealing party, forced.\nAs to the question of whether counsel for the plaintiff had, or had not, authority to consent to the order made by the trial judge, and as to the effect of lack of such authority, then unknown to counsel for the defendant (Mr. Osler, at the request of the court, on his responsibility as counsel, informed us that he was quite unaware of any limitation placed upon the authority of plaintiff\u2019s counsel to give the consent at the time it was given, and, for my part, I entirely accept Mr. Osler\u2019s statement), it is also unnecessary, and would probably be improper, for me to ex- press any view, having regard to my opinion above stated, that it would not have been competent for the Appellate Divisional Court to deal with that matter and, therefore, cannot be competent for us here to pass upon it. But, reference may be had to Shepherd v. Robinson[35] as a late and a very satisfactory exposition of the law upon this aspect of the case.\nSubject to the question as to whether the judgment pronounced at the trial of this action should, or should not, be regarded as a \u201cconsent judgment\u201d and, as such, non-appealable\u2014the question first taken up and on which judgment was reserved,\u2014the appeal was argued by counsel on its merits.\nIt would appear that the plaintiff had some seven or eight additional witnesses, whom he had not yet called, when he was surprised by a ruling of the learned trial judge to the effect that, as the action had been stayed as against the defendant company, and that company was not represented at the trial, it would not be competent for the plaintiff to enquire into its private affairs in its absence, although those affairs were directly involved in, and formed the basis of, allegations made by the plaintiff against the defendant who was before the court and it was necessary to enquire into them, as the plaintiff claimed, in order that he should establish his case. This ruling was given while a witness, one Nash, was under examination-in-chief, and upon objection by counsel for the defendant to a question about certain shipments of goods alleged to have been made by the company through the Canadian National Railway Company. This ruling having been made and briefly discussed, Mr. Grant and Mr. Osler had a conference, after which Mr. Grant announced to the court,\nWe have arranged that matter, my Lord. I wish my friend would consent to our withdrawing the record on our undertaking to pay costs.\nWhereupon a short discussion ensued as to the terms in which the judgment would be pronounced:\nMr. OSLER: I have explained to my friend that my client could not be party to any settlement of this action.\nHis LORDSHIP: Well, by consent action dismissed with costs.\nMr. OSLER: Not by consent, my Lord.\nMr. GRANT: I am consenting.\nHis LORDSHIP: Have you finished your case? Mr. GRANT: Yes, my Lord.\nHis LORDSHIP: Then I will dismiss it with costs.\nMr. GRANT: NO, no, I don\u2019t want that, any Lord.\nAs will be seen, Mr. Grant\u2019s affirmative answer to his Lordship\u2019s question, \u201cHave you finished your case?\u201d was given upon the basis of a judgment going in the terms to which he was consenting. Yet, this observation is relied upon by the Appellate Court as a statement that he deliberately declined to call any further witnesses. To say that this was a deliberate election by counsel to abandon calling the further witnesses he had in court seems to us to be a misconception of his position. The circumstances render the decision in Judson v. McQuain[36], cited by Riddell J.A., quite inapplicable. No doubt, where the sole ground on which a new trial is asked is that, although the party seeking it has had a full opportunity to give evidence himself at the trial, he had deliberately refrained from doing so, that affords\nno ground for a new trial\u2014to allow the defendant to have another chance of convincing another jury in another way would violate all principles of fair play.\nSuch was the holding in Judson v. McQuain36. But there, the circumstances were entirely different from those of the case now before us. Counsel there deliberately decided to call no witnesses and thus to have the advantage of the last address to the jury. The client stood by and did not object.\nThe fact that counsel has not called any witnesses for the defence is no ground for a new trial, whether this was due to his yielding to the advice of others, as in Brown v. Sheppard[37] (Burns J., calls this a \u201cnovel ground for applying for a new trial,\u201d but we have progressed since his day); or to the fact that he rested his defence on what appeared from the evidence of the plaintiff, as in Young v. Moodie[38]; or to relying upon the weakness of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence and desiring to have the last word to the jury, as in Hurrell v. Simpson[39]\u2014even though the Court should be dissatisfied with the verdict[40].\nWith the utmost respect for the learned trial judge, his ruling that all evidence bearing upon the affairs of the company must, in its absence, be excluded, was erroneous, and was largely the cause of the subsequent trouble in this action. An answer to the question put to the witness might involve a disclosure by him of facts ascertained when he examined the books of Hiram Walker & Sons, Limited, on behalf of the Crown, in order to prepare evidence to be given before a Royal Commission. It was, no doubt, objectionable on two perfectly distinct grounds:\u2014\nFirst. It was really an attempt to put in secondary evidence as to what the books show.\nSecond. It was contrary to public policy to permit such enquiry to be made of the witness.\nThe latter ground appears to have been taken by the learned judge as well as that now found to have been wrong, but the former ground does not seem to have been taken by either counsel or court, Mr. Osler having simply said, \u201cI object to that question.\u201d\nIn our opinion, under all the circumstances, the plaintiff should be given an opportunity to place all his evidence before the court. To quote language used by Armour C.J., in the case of Murphy v. G.T.R. Co.[41], \u201cThe case should go back, not for a new trial, but to be tried.\u201d Unfortunately, it will be impossible for the parties to avail themselves of the evidence already in the record and thus to avoid the expense of taking it again, because that would involve sending the case back to the same judge who heard that evidence and who alone is in a position to pass upon the credibility thereof. Mr. Tilley, of counsel for the plaintiff, objects to that course being taken and, as is within his right, wishes that the new trial shall take place before another judge. As is customary in this court where a new trial is ordered, we refrain from further discussion on the merits. Accordingly, as was intimated by this court at the hearing of the present appeal, it will be allowed and the judgment dismissing the action vacated and, in substitution, an order made directing a new trial of this action; the costs of the abortive trial to be in the discretion of the judge who shall preside at the new trial, and the costs of the appeal to this court and in the court of appeal to be costs to the plaintiff in the cause.\nAppeal allowed; new trial ordered.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Winnett, Morehead & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Blake, Lash, Anglin & Cassels.\n[1] (1930) 65 Ont.

La permission d\u2019appeler a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e parce que la cour de dernier ressort de la province de Qu\u00e9bec consid\u00e8re qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une mati\u00e8re importante int\u00e9ressant non seulement l\u2019appelant mais aussi plusieurs autres propri\u00e9taires contribuables de la municipalit\u00e9 de St-Constant, et que la question en est une d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, dont la solution a suscit\u00e9 une divergence d\u2019opinions consid\u00e9rable parmi les juges du pr\u00e9sent litige.\nLe conseil municipal de St-Constant, \u00e0 la demande du demandeur et d\u2019un certain nombre d\u2019autres int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, a, par r\u00e8glement, le 4 novembre 1912, pourvu au macadamisage du chemin du rang St-Pierre, situ\u00e9 dans cette municipalit\u00e9, et \u00e0 son entretien \u00e0 l\u2019avenir, suivant certaines sp\u00e9cifications, stipulant que les d\u00e9penses pour lesdits travaux ne devraient pas d\u00e9passer chaque ann\u00e9e la somme de $6,000 et qu\u2019\nil serait pr\u00e9lev\u00e9 chaque ann\u00e9e par le conseil sur les biens-fonds imposables des contribuables oblig\u00e9s \u00e0 ce chemin, par voie de taxation directe, toute somme de deniers n\u00e9cessaires pour subvenir aux frais de la confection et de l\u2019entretien dudit chemin macadamis\u00e9.\nIl \u00e9tait d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 par le m\u00eame r\u00e8glement que cette route et ce chemin seraient faits et entretenus \u00e0 l\u2019avenir comme route et chemin macadamis\u00e9s. Les am\u00e9liorations pr\u00e9vues furent faites avec l\u2019aide de la province.\nSubs\u00e9quemment, en 1922, l\u2019entretien du chemin du rang St-Pierre ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9glig\u00e9 et n\u2019\u00e9tant pas de la qualit\u00e9 requise par la voirie publique, a \u00e9t\u00e9, suivant la contestation telle qu\u2019engag\u00e9e, mis l\u00e9galement sous le contr\u00f4le du minist\u00e8re de la voirie par une r\u00e9solution du conseil municipal \u00e0 sa s\u00e9ance du 3 avril 1922. En cons\u00e9quence, les travaux de r\u00e9fection du chemin furent faits suivant les exigences du d\u00e9partement de la voirie et en vertu de la loi pass\u00e9e par la l\u00e9gislature pour assurer l\u2019uniformit\u00e9 et la qualit\u00e9 de la voirie dans toute l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la province; et ce, dans l\u2019exercice de l\u2019h\u00e9g\u00e9monie que l\u2019on a cru devoir accorder au d\u00e9partement de la voirie en centralisant la confection et l\u2019entretien des chemins et en abandonnant le syst\u00e8me, qui avait pr\u00e9valu jusqu\u2019alors, de la d\u00e9centralisa- tion et du contr\u00f4le municipal; voulant \u00e9videmment ne pas laisser ce service important \u00e0 la merci de l\u2019apathie et des diverses exigences locales.\nLe d\u00e9partement, s\u2019\u00e9tant rendu \u00e0 la pri\u00e8re de la municipalit\u00e9 de St-Constant, a accord\u00e9 un contrat pour les travaux n\u00e9cessaires pour l\u2019entretien et la r\u00e9paration de la route en question, qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 2041nn de 12 Geo. V, c. 42, comprend, entre autres, \u201cl\u2019huilage, le goudronnage et la r\u00e9fection des macadams; le rechargement des gravelages; le renouvellement en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des rev\u00eatements des chauss\u00e9es\u201d.\nLes travaux co\u00fbt\u00e8rent au total $56,017.83, qui furent pay\u00e9s par le gouvernement, sauf une somme, finalement r\u00e9duite \u00e0 $12,088.76, que la province, en vertu de la loi, a droit de recouvrer de la municipalit\u00e9 intim\u00e9e. Comme le dit parfaitement l\u2019honorable juge L\u00e9tourneau, toute la cause repose sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et l\u2019application qu\u2019il faut faire de l\u2019article 2041qq de 12 Geo. V, \u0441 42, qui \u00e9tait encore en vigueur le 3 avril 1922, lorsque, par r\u00e9solution, la municipalit\u00e9 a soumis au contr\u00f4le du ministre de la voirie le chemin dont il s\u2019agit.\nCette disposition a \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduite par 13 Geo.

Les sp\u00e9cifications contenues au r\u00e8glement municipal alors en vigueur pourvoyant \u00e0 la confection et \u00e0 l\u2019entretien des chemins du rang St-Pierre peuvent-elles pr\u00e9valoir contre les dispositions de la loi qui laissent au ministre de la voirie la d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 la nature et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tendue des travaux qu\u2019il convient de faire pour entretenir les chemins dans l\u2019\u00e9tat jug\u00e9 convenable par l\u2019administration?\nJe crois que nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un des cas o\u00f9 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat particulier doit s\u2019effacer devant l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral; et la l\u00e9gislature a statu\u00e9:\n1o Les sp\u00e9cifications locales ne sauraient pr\u00e9valoir ni \u00eatre maintenues \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des exigences du d\u00e9partement pour atteindre au degr\u00e9 de perfection uniforme voulu par l\u2019administration;\n2\u00b0 Le secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 pour r\u00e9partir, par un r\u00f4le special, la partie du co\u00fbt des travaux exigibles de la municipalit\u00e9, et ce conform\u00e9ment au mode pr\u00e9vu aux r\u00e8glements alors en vigueur dans la municipalit\u00e9.\nOr, quelle \u00e9tait la l\u00e9gislation municipale de St-Constant au moment o\u00f9 cet officier a d\u00fb pr\u00e9parer ce r\u00f4le sp\u00e9cial? D\u2019apr\u00e8s la loi, le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 devait \u00eatre pr\u00e9lev\u00e9: 1o soit sur toute la municipalit\u00e9; 2\u00b0 soit seulement sur les immeubles tenus \u00e0 l\u2019entretien du chemin o\u00f9 les travaux avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s et ce, dans les deux cas, suivant les r\u00e8glements de voirie en vigueur dans la municipalit\u00e9. Cette disposition doit se relier \u00e0 l\u2019article 463 du code municipal qui donne \u00e0 toute corporation le pouvoir d\u2019ordonner, par r\u00e9solution ou par r\u00e8glement, 1o que les travaux d\u2019entretien d\u2019un chemin macadamis\u00e9 seront faits par les contribuables eux-m\u00eames d\u00e9sign\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9solution ou le r\u00e8glement, ou \u00e0 leurs frais, ou 2\u00b0 aux frais et \u00e0 la charge de la corporation int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, au moyen de deniers pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s par taxation directe sur tous les biens-fonds imposables dans\u055d la municipalit\u00e9; mais, dans tous les cas, sous le contr\u00f4le de la municipalit\u00e9 dans les limites de laquelle se trouve le chemin en question.\nIl ressort de cette l\u00e9gislation, comme des articles 533 et 535 (a) de l\u2019ancien code municipal en vigueur en 1912, qu\u2019un r\u00e8glement est n\u00e9cessaire pour d\u00e9terminer si les travaux d\u2019entretien d\u2019un chemin macadamis\u00e9 sont \u00e0 la charge de la corporation et payables \u00e0 m\u00eame les deniers pr\u00e9lev\u00e9s sur tous les biens-fonds de la municipalit\u00e9, ou si, comme dans notre esp\u00e8ce, les travaux d\u2019entretien doivent \u00eatre faits par les contribuables d\u00e9sign\u00e9s dans le r\u00e8glement et \u00e0 leurs frais.\nIl est incontestable que les seuls r\u00e8glements en vigueur lors de la pr\u00e9paration du r\u00f4le de perception dans cette municipalit\u00e9 concernant la route St-Pierre sont ceux invoqu\u00e9s par le demandeur dans son action. Il veut les maintenir en vigueur pour la nature et le co\u00fbt des travaux, nonobstant la l\u00e9gislation intervenue.\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s moi, la loi a maintenu ces r\u00e8glements en vigueur seulement pour permettre au secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier de d\u00e9terminer le mode de perception et pr\u00e9lever le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 par le gouvernement, soit sur toute la municipalit\u00e9, quand un r\u00e8glement le dit, soit seulement sur les immeubles dont les propri\u00e9taires sont tenus \u00e0 l\u2019entretien du chemin, quand un r\u00e8glement \u00e0 cet effet existe dans la municipalit\u00e9.\nLe demandeur se plaint d\u2019\u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 payer un montant plus consid\u00e9rable qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait eu \u00e0 d\u00e9bourser si les travaux avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 limit\u00e9s au macadamisage, tel que pr\u00e9vu en 1912. Il ne faut pas oublier cependant que, d\u00e8s cette date, des int\u00e9ress\u00e9s pr\u00e9voyaient une d\u00e9pense possible de $6,000 par ann\u00e9e.

On the letter, the most the respondent might have hoped for was that on payment before pleading the court would relieve it of the costs up to payment.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court P. Cousineau J.1, and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported. Charles Laurendeau K.C. for the appellant.\nHerv\u00e9 Roch for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nLamont J.\u2014The facts in this case are not in dispute. The appellant sued the respondent corporation in the Superior Court on four promissory notes made by the corporation in favour of the appellant and amounting in all to $6,073.47.\nThe defence set up was that the action was premature. At the time the action was brought, September 3, 1929, the maturity date of the notes sued on was passed, but the corporation relies on the fact that, on August 28, 1929, the appellant wrote to the secretary of the corporation a letter in the following terms:\u2014\nJe vous retourne vos billets pour la derni\u00e8re fois et je vous avertis que d\u2019ici \u00e0 15 jours si je n\u2019ai pas un r\u00e8glement de tous les billets je prendrai des proc\u00e9dures.\nJe ne peux pas porter ces billets.\nThis letter, it was contended on behalf of the corporation, had the effect of extending the time for payment of the notes until the expiration of fifteen days from the date of the letter and, as action was brought within fifteen days, it was prematurely brought.\nThe first question to be considered is: Did the appellant, by this letter, intend to signify to the corporation that he was extending the time within which the notes would become due for another fifteen days, or simply to intimate that he would not exercise his right to sue on the overdue notes for that length of time? In my opinion the latter is the true construction. I cannot see in the letter anything that would justify the conclusion that the appellant was assenting to any modification of the terms of the obligations expressed in the promissory notes. Putting it at the very highest, the letter neither declares nor conveys by implication anything more than an assent to postpone the exercise of his undoubted right to sue. The letter is not to be construed as depriving the appellant of his rights to any greater extent than the language used calls for. Even conceding that it implies a promise to refrain from suing for fifteen days, and assuming that, in the circumstances, the respondent assented to this promise, such a promise would not afford a defence to the action. That being so and the notes being overdue when the appellant sued, his action cannot be said to have been prematurely, brought. On the letter the most the respondent might have hoped for was that on payment before pleading the court would relieve it of the costs up to payment.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed, the judgment below set aside and the judgment of the Superior Court restored. The appellant is entitled to his costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lalonde & Lalonde.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Baril & Tousignant.\n[1] (1930) Q.R. 49 K.B. 172.\n1 (1930) Q.R. 49 K.B. 172.\n"}

Though finding misdirection in a material matter, the majority of the court (Cannon J. contra) held that it did not result in a miscarriage of justice or wrong to the accused. (Cr. C., s. 1014 (2).)\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe, Lamont and Smith JJ.\u2014The misdirection by the trial judge to the jury was that, although he warned the jury properly of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, he further instructed them, in effect, that if they believed his evidence, although not corroborated, it was their duty to convict the accused. This was a departure by the trial judge from the direction given by this court in Vigeant v. The King ([1930] Can. S.C.R. 396, at 399, 400) as to the proper course to be taken in regard to warning of the danger of convicting without corroborative evidence. The law as very carefully considered and laid down in that case should be strictly followed by trial judges and any substantial departure from it must always be attended with peril. The rule requiring warning applies equally whether there be or be not in fact corroborative evidence of the testimony of an accomplice. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, criminal side, and sustaining the conviction of the appellant.\nThe appellant was charged with having received from his clients, in the course of his business as broker, various sums of money and other securities with instructions to apply the same, in whole or in part, to the purchase of securities upon stock exchanges and of fraudulently, in violation of good faith and contrary to such direction, applying these sums of money and securities to his own private use and the use of his firm. The main testimony against the accused was given by a witness who, it was admitted, had been an accomplice. The principal ground of appeal was that the trial judge failed to properly instruct the jury as to the danger of accepting, without corroboration, the testimony of an accomplice.\nL. Gendron K.C. for the appellant.\nE. Bertrand K.C. for the respondent.\nAt the conclusion of the argument, the judgment of the majority of the court was orally delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C\u2014We do not think it necessary to reserve judgment in this case. We have had abundant opportunity to look into it both during the exhaustive argument here and before. While the majority of us ar\u0435 of the opinion that there was misdirection in a material matter, in that the learned judge, although he warned the jury properly of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, further instructed them, in effect, that if they believed his evidence, although not corroborated, it was their duty to convict (and we wish to compliment counsel for the accused on the ability he has shewn in the presentation of the case in this regard), we are also satisfied that the jury, properly directed, must have reached the same conclusion as that actually reached in this case (Brooks v. The King[1]).\nMoreover we are all satisfied that the jury could not, on the evidence in the case, have failed to convict the accused. The case, therefore, is one for the application of section 1014 (2) of the Criminal Code, and the Court, being convinced that the misdirection did not result im any miscarriage of justice or wrong to the accused, is unanimously of the view that the appeal fails and that the conviction must be affirmed. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.\nWe should add that we entirely disagree with the view of Mr. Justice Hall that the rule requiring warning does not apply where there is, in fact, corroboration. The rule applies equally whether there be or be not corroborative evidence of the testimony of an accomplice.\nThe departure by the learned trial judge in the present case from the plain direction given by this court in Vigeant v. The King[2], as to the proper course to be taken in regard to warning of the danger of convicting without corroborative evidence very nearly wrecked this conviction. The law as very carefully considered and laid down in that case should be strictly followed by trial judges. Any substantial departure from it must always be attended with peril.\nCannon J.\u2014With respect, I cannot agree that the learned trial judge, after warning the jury properly of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, further instructed them, in effect, that if they believed that evidence, although not corroborated, it was their duty to convict, I cannot read such instructions in the following words of the learned judge:\nMaintenant la complicit\u00e9 se pr\u00e9sente dans cette affaire. La d\u00e9fense a pr\u00e9venu le tribunal de donner la direction aux jur\u00e9s que si les jur\u00e9s en arrivent \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il y a des t\u00e9moins complices en cette cause\u2014\u00e9videmment il ne peut s\u2019agir que de Statz\u2014il est toujours dangereux de condamner un individu sur le t\u00e9moignage de son complice, surtout si ce t\u00e9moignage n\u2019est pas corrobor\u00e9. Mais il est de mon devoir de vous dire que, m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019est pas corrobor\u00e9, vous devez tout de m\u00eame prendre en consid\u00e9ration le t\u00e9moignage du complice, le peser et en tirer les conclusions que vous croyez devoir tirer. Le t\u00e9moignage du complice est re\u00e7u, mais il a plus ou moins de force selon qu\u2019il est plus ou moins corrobor\u00e9.\nI reach the conclusion that the two points raised by the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Allard were badly taken, and I would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] [1927] Can.

l\u2019affaire en litige dans l\u2019appel, cette somme ou valeur peut se prouver par attestation sous serment, mais elle ne doit pas comprendre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat post\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la date du prononc\u00e9 du jugement port\u00e9 en appel, ni aucuns frais, on pourrait peut-\u00eatre dire qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat p\u00e9cuniaire directement en litige. On ne saurait donner une valeur pr\u00e9cise en argent au droit r\u00e9clam\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e et accord\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi de faire r\u00e9tracter le jugement en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour remettre les parties dans l\u2019\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elles \u00e9taient avant jugement et compl\u00e9ter l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Le remboursement par la mise en cause des montants pay\u00e9s, si l\u2019intim\u00e9e r\u00e9ussit plus tard en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure sur le rescisoire, est une cons\u00e9quence possible du jugement frapp\u00e9 d\u2019appel, mais ce n\u2019est pas le jugement.\nIl n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, cependant, de d\u00e9cider d\u00e9finitivement cette question, vu que, dans notre opinion, nous ne sommes pas en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un jugement final ou d\u00e9finitif, aux termes de l\u2019article 36 de la loi de la Cour Supr\u00eame.\nL\u2019article 2, paragraphe (e), signifie\ntout jugement, r\u00e8gle, ordonnance ou d\u00e9cision qui d\u00e9termine en totalit\u00e9 ou en partie un droit absolu d\u2019une des parties au proc\u00e8s dans une proc\u00e9dure judiciaire.\nLe jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi, tout en accordant, dans l\u2019exercice de sa discr\u00e9tion, le rescindant, a express\u00e9ment r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le rescisoire et ordonne seulement que le jugement soit r\u00e9tract\u00e9 et place les parties dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tat o\u00f9 elles se trouvaient avant le jugement. Je ne crois pas que cette d\u00e9cision puisse \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme d\u00e9cisive concernant les droits de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties au premier litige devant le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance. Il est vrai que la controverse est r\u00e9ouverte et que toute la question, qui semblait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 vid\u00e9e d\u00e9finitivement par le premier jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, sera de nouveau d\u00e9cid\u00e9e apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9ouverture de l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Je ne crois pas que nous soyons en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un jugement final, suivant les donn\u00e9es qui nous sont fournies par la Cour d\u2019Appel en Angleterre dans Salomon v. Warner[1]:\nNo order, judgment or other proceeding can be final which does not at once affect the status of the partus for whichever side the decision may be given; so that if it is given for the plaintiff it is conclusive againts the defendant, and if it is given for the defendant it is conclusive against the plaintiff, and no order in an action will be found to be final unless a decision upon the application out of which it arises, but given in favour of the other party to the action, would have determined the matter in dispute.\nEt Lord Esher, dans cette cause, nous dit:\nIf the decision, whichever way it is given, will, if it stands, finally dispose of the matter in dispute, I think that for the purposes of the rule it is final. On the other hand, if the decision if given in one way will finally dispose of the matter in dispute, but if given in the other will allow the action to go on, then I think it is not finad but interlocutory.\nSi la Cour du Banc du Roi avait renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019appel et maintenu le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure renvoyant la requ\u00eate civile, on pourrait dire qu\u2019elle aurait r\u00e9gl\u00e9 d\u00e9finitivement et finalement le proc\u00e8s en refusant le dernier recours utile contre le jugement. Mais le jugement dont on veut appeler \u00e9tant favorable \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante et n\u2019ayant pas d\u2019autre effet que de lui permettre de r\u00e9ouvrir l\u2019enqu\u00eate et de continuer le proc\u00e8s, sans d\u00e9terminer le bien ou le mal fond\u00e9 d\u00fb droit r\u00e9clam\u00e9 par les demandeurs appelants dans leur action, n\u2019a pas les \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9cessaires pour en faire un jugement final et d\u00e9finitif au sens de l\u2019article.\nJe crois bon de mentionner que l\u2019article 36 (b) donne juridiction \u00e0 cette cour lorsque le jugement de la plus haute cour \u00e9tablie dans une province accorde une motion de d\u00e9sistement ou ordonne un nouveau proc\u00e8s. Pouvons-nous, vu que la requ\u00eate civile a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e et le jugement mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00e0 cause de la d\u00e9couverte d\u2019une nouvelle pi\u00e8ce, consid\u00e9rer ce jugement comme ordonnant un nouveau proc\u00e8s aux termes de ce sous-paragraphe 36 (b)? Je serais port\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure dans l\u2019affirmative, si ce sous-paragraphe, tel que r\u00e9dig\u00e9, pouvait s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 un arr\u00eat admettant le rescindant sur une requ\u00eate civile, proc\u00e9dure toute sp\u00e9ciale au regime l\u00e9gal de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Il ne s\u2019agit pas exactement d\u2019un nouveau proc\u00e8s, mais de la continuation de \u013eenqu\u00eate en pla\u00e7ant les parties dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tat o\u00f9 elles \u00e9taient avant le jugement, avec permission de produire une nouvelle preuve pour compl\u00e9ter le m\u00eame proc\u00e8s et obtenir un nouveau jugement dans la m\u00eame instance.\nPour ces raisons, je crois que la motion devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e et \u013eappel renvoy\u00e9 pour d\u00e9faut de juridiction, le tout avec d\u00e9pens contre les appelants.\nMotion granted with costs.\n[1] [1891] 1 Q.B. 734.\n"}

Rural Municipality of Winchester, [1931] S.C.R. 628\nDate: 1931-06-30\nFrank Pierce (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Rural Municipality of Winchester (Defendant) Respondent.\n1931: May 5; 1931: June 30.\nPresent: Anglin \u0421.J.C. and Newcombe, Rinfret, Smith and Cannon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nMunicipal corporation\u2014Drainage\u2014Flooding of land\u2014Repairs\u2014Duty of municipality\u2014Effect of section 740 Municipal Act\u2014Right of action for damage\u2014The Municipal Act, R.S.M., 1913, \u0441. 133, ss. 471, 472, 624, 625, 740.\nThe appellant brought an action for damage by flooding of his lands caused by the non-repair and obstruction of a drain or ditch situated within the territorial limits of the respondent municipality and partially built with the aid of the government of the province. Section 740 of the Municipal Act provides that \u201cit shall be the duty of each municipality through which, or through any part of which, any drain, constructed wholly or partially by or at the expense of the Government of Manitoba, runs to keep such drain, or that portion of such drain, within its boundaries, properly cleaned out and in repair.\u201d\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (39 Man. R. 132), Newcombe and Cannon JJ. dissecting, that section 740 was intended merely to make it clear that, as between the government of the province and the municipality, the duty was on the latter to keep such drains in repair, and that it was not intended to make the municipality liable to an action for damage caused to the owner of adjacent land by the municipality\u2019s failure to perform that duty. The improvement or protection against flooding of adjacent land was not a purpose of the construction of the ditch, but the sole object of such construction was to facilitate the maintenance and use by travellers of the roadway. Thus the appellant, as owner, was not a person for whose benefit the duty of maintaining the ditch in repair was imposed on the municipality by section 740, and he cannot therefore maintain an action for damages against the municipality based solely upon its nonfeasance or neglect to perform a duty imposed by that section. City of Vancouver v. McPhelan, 45 Can. S.C.R. 194, at 209, applied.\nPer Newcombe J. dissenting.\u2014Pr\u00ecma facie, a proprietor, whose lands are flooded by reason of the neglect of the municipality to discharge its statutory duty to clear the drain, is entitled, in the absence of any expression or necessary implication of the statute to the contrary, to recover from the municipality the consequential damages. The burden is upon the respondent to displace the ordinary and natural interpretation and effect of section 740; and no provision of the statute has been cited to justify the conclusion that section 740 was meant only to relieve the province of a possible liability against which it was desirous to protect itself.\nPer Cannon J. dissenting.\u2014Section 471 of the Municipal Act provides that \u201cthe council shall not permit the damming up, obstruction of * * * any ditch in or upon any road * * * or elsewhere in the municipality\u201d; and section 472 gives a recourse for damage alleged to have been done to a property in consequence of a violation of section 471. Therefore the appellant was entitled to recover damages to his property in consequence of a violation by the respondent of the provisions of section 471 and also of section 740 of the Municipal Act. That statute, expressly or by implication, does not exclude the right of action presently exercised by the appellant under these sections, section 472 merely creating an additional recourse.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba1, reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Armstrong C.C.J.1, and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action for damages caused by the flooding of his land.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nO. M. Biggar K.C. for the appellant.\nF. M. Burbidge K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret and Smith JJ.) was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014We are of the opinion that this appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs, substantially for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Fullerton.\nThe improvement, or protection against flooding, of adjacent lands was not, in any sense, a purpose of the construction of the ditch in question. It was found by the courts below that the object (no doubt, they meant the sole object) of such construction was to facilitate the\n(1930) 39 Man. R. 132; [1930] 2 W.W.R. 752. maintenance and use by travellers of the roadway leading to the nearby town. That being so, it cannot be said that the plaintiff, as owner of adjacent lands, which he alleged to have been flooded in consequence of failure to keep in repair the ditch in question, is a person for whose benefit the duty of maintaining the ditch in repair was imposed on the municipality by section 740 of the Municipal Act, notwithstanding the fact that the Manitoba Government had contributed to the expense of its construction. As indicated in City of Vancouver v. McPhalen2, he, therefore, cannot maintain an action for damages against the municipality based solely upon its nonfeasance or neglect to perform a duty imposed by section 740. An analogous principle underlies the discussion of the case of The John Goodison Thresher Co. v. Township of McNab[1].\nSection 471\u2014the only other section invoked by the appellant\u2014provides for the case of misfeasance or of the non-completion of a work by a municipality. (The word \u201cpermit\u201d in that section, having regard to its context, should be read as meaning \u201cgive permission for,\u201d i.e., \u201cactively sanction\u201d not merely \u201cpassively allow.\u201d) The facts in evidence in the case now before us do not bring it within section 471; nor is there any finding that would justify this appeal under that section.\nReference was also made in the course of the argument to section 625, in addition to section 624, both of which are mentioned by Fullerton J.A., towards the close of his judgment, as indicating the practice of the legislature of Manitoba, when intending to confer a right of action for nonfeasance by a municipality, to do so in explicit terms. Of course, the proviso of section 624 has no application to the present case, because, here, the overflow of water was not occasioned by ice or snow obstructions in the ditch, or by reason of unusual rainfalls. Nor has section 625 any application to the case at bar, because it has to do entirely with keeping in repair public roads, streets, bridges and highways and does not concern the overflow of water in ditches by reason of non-repair or otherwise. In both sections, however, the liability of the municipality for non-repair upon the works therein specified is recognized and a right of action is impliedly conferred in section 624, and explicitly conferred in section 625, upon the persons aggrieved by a non-performance of the duty of repair.\nNewcombe J. (dissenting).\u2014By judgment of the County Court of Debraine, Manitoba, the plaintiff recovered damages from the defendant municipality for the flooding of his lands, caused by the overflow of a drain constructed thereon by and within the limits of the municipality with the aid of the Government of the province.\nSection 740 of the Municipal Act, R.S.M., 1913, c. 133, as amended, provides that\nIt shall be the duty of each municipality through which, or through any part of which, any drain, constructed wholly or partially by or at the expense of the Government of Manitoba, runs, to keep such drain, or that portion of such drain within its boundaries, properly cleaned out and in repair. Any person filling up or partially filling up amy such drain shall be liable to a fine of not less than five dollars nor more than fifty dollars, and, in default of payment, to imprisonment for not less than one week or more than two months. R.S.M., c. 133, s. 740.\nThe majority of the Court of Appeal was of the opinion that this enactment did not operate for the benefit of the plaintiff or other proprietors in the vicinity, but that the purpose of the drain was to enable the defendant municipality to make roads in a low-lying district, and that, although, incidentally, it had the effect, while properly maintained, of draining the plaintiff\u2019s land and so improving it, the intent of the legislative provision was, nevertheless, merely to declare that, as between the Government and the municipality, the duty to repair fell to the municipality, and not to the Government ; and that it was not intended to impose liability upon the municipality to a proprietor who had suffered damages by the flooding of his land, consequent upon the natural clogging of the ditch which it was the duty of the municipality to prevent; this view, it is said, is confirmed by sections 624 and 625 of the Municipal Act respecting public roads, by which it is not only provided that the roads shall be kept in repair by the municipality within which they lie, but expressly, that, for default in keeping the roads in repair, the municipality shall\nbe civilly responsible for all damages sustained by reason of such default.\nBut I am not satisfied with that interpretation, nor to reverse the decision of the learned County Court Judge. It is possible of course to speculate as to legislative motives in most cases depending upon the application or interpretation of statutes which come to be determined; but the meaning must be ascertained by interpreting the language which the legislature has used, not by substituting a different expression. It is more likely, I think, that the legislature would provide a sanction for the upkeep of the drains to the construction of which the province had contributed than that it would use the language of section 740 for no other purpose than to deny provincial liability; and I am unable to reject the meaning, so plainly expressed, that it is the duty of the municipality to clear out the drains described. If it were for the maintenance of the road that the drain was required, the neglect to repair it would, I should have thought, be actionable negligence which could be charged by any person who, in the lawful use of the highway, suffered damages by the neglect to repair. This would seem to follow from Lord Watson\u2019s judgment in the Privy Council in Sanitary Commissioners of Gibraltar v. Or fila4, where, referring to the Mersey Docks case, he quoted the rule there enunciated by Blackburn J., which met with the approval of the House of Lords, that\nIn the absence of something to shew a contrary intention, the legislature intends that the body, the creature of the statute, shall have the same duties, and that its funds shall be rendered subject to the same liabilities, as the general law would impose on a private person doing the same thing.\nIt is true that, as to the road itself, the civil liability to answer for damages caused by non-repair, is expressly provided by sections 624 and 625 of the Municipal Act. But the question of municipal liability for mere non-feasance in the maintenance of highways and bridges had been much agitated in Canada; and it had been viewed as an exception from the general law, for reasons which are to be extracted from a long line of cases, early examples of which include Thomas v. Sorrell5, and the well known case of Russell v. Men of Devon6 ; and the question had, for Nova Scotia at least, been determined by the judgment of the Privy Council in Municipality of Pictou v. Geldert7, overruling a decision of this court and the provincial cases under the Municipal Act of that province. And subsequently, in this court, it was held, upon appeal from British Columbia, in the City of Vancouver v. McPhalen8 (affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal) that, quoting the words of the headnote,\nWhere a municipal corporation is guilty of negligent default by nonfeasance of the statutory duty imposed upon it to keep its highways in good repair, and adequate means have been provided by statuite for the purpose of enabling it to perform its obligations in that respect (v.g. 64 Vict., ch. 54 B.C.), persons suffering injuries in consequence of such omission may maintain civil actions against the corporation to recover compensation in damages, although no such right of action has been expressly provided for by statute, unless something in the statute itself or in the circumstances in which it was enacted justifies the inference that no such right of action was to be conferred.\nPer Fitzpatrick, \u0421.J., and Duff, J.\u2014The common law obligation under which the inhabitants of parishes, in England, through which highways passed were responsible for their repair hius no application in the province of British Columbia.\nIt was therefore very natural that in Manitoba they should introduce special provisions with regard to the highways and bridges; but the reasons did not exist for any express declaration of civil liability as to the ditches which did not form part of the roads; and as to these I would not draw any inference of an intention to exempt the municipality from liability for flooding caused by the neglect of its statutory duty to repair.\nThe question therefore is, whether the Assembly, in enacting section 740 of the Municipal Act, expressed, as it is, without any qualification, has shewn an intention to exclude the proprietors of contiguous lands from the benefit of its general provisions; and the answer, I think, is to be found in the dissenting judgment of Blackburn, J., in \u0421\u043e\u0435 v. Wise9 The majority was reversed by the Exchequer Chamber10, which maintained the action for the reasons stated by Blackburn, J., to the effect that in view of then recent decisions in Gibbs v. Trustees of Liverpool Docks11, and Mersey Docks Board v. Penhallow12, the enquiry was reduced to one question, namely, whether the statute had imposed on the Drainage Commissioners a duty to take due care that the sluice was maintained as unqualifiedly as the duty which the law cast upon the Mersey Docks Board to take care that their docks were reasonably safe. He quoted the statute and proceeded to say that\nNothing has been pointed out on the argument, and I have not myself discovered anything to qualify this enactment, which certainly seems to me to cast upon the Drainage Commissioners the duty to maintain this sluice. The common law gives a right of action against those neglecting a duty cast upon them to those who, in consequence, sustain damage. I entirely assent to the position that if the Legislature have shewn an intention to prohibit this right of action in the present case that will effectually prevent it, and I agree that such an intention need not be shewn in express words if it can be collected from the whole Act, but I think that the onus lies on the defendants to shew that it was intended to prevent the right of action, and not on the plaintiff to shew that it was intended to give it.\nMy conclusion therefore is that, prima facie, a proprietor whose lands are flooded by reason of the neglect of the municipality to discharge its statutory duty of clearing the drain would, in the absence of any expression or necessary implication of the statute to the contrary, be entitled to recover from the municipality the consequential damages; and I see no reason why that intention should be regarded as improbable. The burden is upon the municipality to displace the ordinary and natural interpretation of the clause which creates the duty; and our attention has not been called to any provision of the statute to justify the competing suggestion, which seems to rest upon nothing more real than conjecture, that the clause in question was meant only to relieve the province of a possible liability against which it was desirous to protect itself.\nThe argument by which it is sought to limit the application of the statute by reference to its headings has been held to be inadmissible in cases like this where the enactment is clear. But if the headings may be invoked, it should be observed that section 740, along with the two next preceding sections, is itself included in a separate group led by the words \u201cProtection of Property\u201d\u2014an introduction not inapt for a clause intended to impose a duty of care to prevent the flooding of property.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the trial judgment, with costs, both in this court and in the Court of Appeal.\nCannon J. (dissenting).\u2014Under section 471 of the Municipal Act, being chapter 133 of the Revised Statutes of Manitoba, 1913, the council of any municipality must make full and adequate provision for conveying off the water and preventing its lodgment on any place, or the overflow thereof on contiguous lands; and, accordingly, the council shall not permit the damming up, obstruction, or leave uncompleted for any length of time any ditch in or upon any road, highway, street, lane, or elsewhere in the municipality.\nSection 472 gives a recourse for damage alleged to have been done to the property of an individual in consequence of a violation of section 471.\nMoreover, under section 740, the municipality had the duty to keep properly cleaned out and in repair this drain which had been constructed and reconstructed partially at the expense of the government of Manitoba.\nThe above statutory duty being imposed, in my opinion, on the respondent, for the benefit of individual landowners like the appellant, the following questions must be answered:\n(a) Has the appellant suffered a special damage by such breach?\nThe answer must be in the affirmative, in view of the findings of the trial judge and the uncontradicted evidence of the plaintiff.\n(b) Is the damage within the mischief contemplated by the statute?\nI reach the conclusion that the statute contemplates the conveying off of the water and preventing its lodgment or the overflow thereof on contiguous land; the damages claimed by the plaintiff resulted to his property from the very mischief mentioned in the above section.\n(c) Has the statute, expressly or by implication, excluded the remedy by action?\nMy answer is in the negative. Section 472 creates an additional recourse, but does not do away with the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts to enable an individual to recover damages to his property in consequence of a violation by a municipality of the provisions of sections 471 and 740 of this statute.\nI would therefore grant the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge which costs throughout for the appellant.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: M.

Perkins (Intervenant) Respondent,\n1931: February 26; 1931: June 12.\nPresent: Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KINGAS BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nRevendication\u2014Petition to recover goods\u2014Judgment granting it\u2014Intervention by third party claiming ownership or lien\u2014Goods destroyed by fire before judgment dismissing intervention\u2014Right of owner to claim value of goods from third party\u2014Allegation of petition\u2014Whether it constitutes an admission or \u201caveu\u201d\u2014Litigious rights\u2014Arts. 1200, 1670, 1682 et seq. C.C.\nOne who, upon legal proceedings being brought against the liquidators of an insolvent estate to recover possession of certain machines, by filing an intervention in the proceedings prevents the owner of the machines from getting immediate possession (to which the liquidators consent), is liable to the owner for the value of the machines if, pending contestation, they are destroyed by fire and the intervention is subsequently dismissed. Per Rinfret and Lamont JJ.: In such a case, the intervenant is not penalized for having had recourse to the courts in an attempt to exercise his rights; but, under 1200 C.C. and foll., he is condemned to fulfill the obligation incurred by reason of the wrongful detention of the property of another, after having been duly put en demeure to deliver it.\nThe allegation in the respondent\u2019s petition brought against the liquidators for the recovery of the machines, that the goods were in the liquidators\u2019 possession, did not constitute an admission or \u201caveu\u201d of such a fact; but it was simply an averment of fact, in the nature of an argument, which the liquidators were at liberty to admit or deny. Per Duff, Newcombe and Cannon JJ.\u2014Even if such an allegation could be construed as an admission or \u201caveu,\u201d it cannot be invoked as such by the appellant and cannot affect the question as to the possession of the goods at the time of the fire, which occurred long after such allegation, inasmuch as it had been made in proceedings taken, not against the appellant, but against the liquidators.\nThe provisions of the Code relating to retrait litigieux (CC. 1582 & foll.) do not apply to the sale of debts and rights of action of an insolvent estate made, after judicial authorization, by the liquidator of the estate. APPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Marchand J., and maintaining the respondents intervention.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nGregor Barclay K.C. for the appellant.\nH. N. Chauvin K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Duff, Newcombe and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nCannon J.\u2014Cette cause revient pour la seconde fois devant cette cour, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e \u00e0 deux reprises par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi. Dans les deux cas, \u013eappelant, apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9ussi en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, s\u2019est vu condamn\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi \u00e0 payer aux demandeurs-intimes $2,769, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de la remise de trois appareils de vues anim\u00e9es, propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des intim\u00e9s.\nLe 9 septembre 1922, la demanderesse produisait une requ\u00eate dans la faillite de J.-A. Caron et J.-F. Toupin, du Cap de la Madeleine, propri\u00e9taires de th\u00e9\u00e2tre, pour \u00eatre mise en possession de trois appareils cin\u00e9matographiques dont elle r\u00e9clamait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Cette requ\u00eate \u00e9tait dirig\u00e9e contre les syndics Damphousse et H\u00e9bert, qui ne la contest\u00e8rent pas.\nLe 10 octobre 1922, \u013eappelant Abran fit une intervention demandant le renvoi de la requ\u00eate des demandeurs, pr\u00e9tendant \u00eatre le propri\u00e9taire de certaines machines \u00e9chang\u00e9es en paiement partiel des appareils en question, et demandant d\u2019en garder possession, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, vu l\u2019existence d\u2019un privil\u00e8ge de locateur sur les effets r\u00e9clam\u00e9s par \u013eintim\u00e9e.\nL\u2019intervention de \u013eappelant fut rejet\u00e9e par jugement en date du 2 avril 1924.\nLes syndics inform\u00e8rent l\u2019intim\u00e9e qu\u2019ils se trouvaient dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de le remettre en possession des appareils, vu qu\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truits par un incendie le 26 d\u00e9cembre 1922, au cours de l\u2019instance. Lors du feu, Abran \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019immeuble, dont il laissait la jouissance aux syndics, qui avaient sous-lou\u00e9 \u00e0 des tiers. En vertu du bail, tous les droits des syndics contre le locataire avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9s \u00e0 \u013eappelant depuis le 23 juillet 1922, et ce dernier devenait le locateur ayant droit direct d\u2019action contre le sous-locataire.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que \u013eappelant, lors de \u013eincendie, \u00e9tait en possession des appareils, en d\u00e9faut de les remettre \u00e0 la demanderesse, leur propri\u00e9taire, et, qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, vu la perte de la chose, il devait en payer la valeur.\n\u013dappelant pr\u00e9tend que le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi est erron\u00e9:\n1o En d\u00e9clarant que \u013eappelant aurait r\u00e9clam\u00e9, le 10 octobre 1922, la possession des appareils cin\u00e9matographiques en question;\n2\u00b0 En d\u00e9clarant que \u013eappelant \u00e9tait en possession de ces appareils lors de \u013eincendie, le 26 d\u00e9cembre 1922;\n3\u00b0 Par un factum suppl\u00e9mentaire, \u013eappelant soul\u00e8ve un point nouveau bas\u00e9 sur le pr\u00e9tendu aveu de \u013eintim\u00e9e, dans sa premi\u00e8re r\u00e9clamation, que, en septembre 1922, les machines \u00e9taient en possession des syndics; le jugement rendu entre les parties sur l\u2019intervention de \u013eappelant et celui accordant la requ\u00eate en revendication de \u013eintim\u00e9e ayant acquis \u013eautorit\u00e9 de chose jug\u00e9e, militeraient en faveur de \u013eappelant.\nCe dernier moyen ne semble pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 devant la Cour du Banc du Roi; et, malgr\u00e9 \u013eargument ing\u00e9nieux du procureur de \u013eappelant, je ne crois pas pouvoir lui donner raison. Lorsque \u013eintim\u00e9e a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que les syndics \u00e9taient en possession le 9 septembre 1922, il ne faisait que constater que ces derniers, malgr\u00e9 ses instances depuis la faillite, au mois d\u2019avril pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, avaient n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de remettre ces machines, qui, de toute \u00e9vidence, en vertu des contrats, n\u2019\u00e9taient pas la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des faillis et n\u2019auraient jamais d\u00fb \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme faisant partie de l\u2019actif c\u00e9d\u00e9. Mais, comme il appert abondamment \u00e0 la preuve, les syndics, de concert avec l\u2019appelant, dans le but de conserver une valeur au th\u00e9\u00e2tre, propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ce dernier, et de lui garder une client\u00e8le en continuant l\u2019exploitation, avaient adopt\u00e9 tous les moyens dilatoires possibles pour conserver les machines absolument n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 cette fin. On avait l\u2019espoir de trouver un acqu\u00e9reur qui permettrait de d\u00e9sint\u00e9resser \u013eappelant, propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019immeuble, et payer en m\u00eame temps la demanderesse, propri\u00e9taire des appareils sur lesquels rien n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 par les faillis. D\u2019ailleurs, lorsque cette all\u00e9gation fut faite par le procureur de la demanderesse, aucune instance n\u2019existait entre cette derni\u00e8re et l\u2019appelant. Quand \u013eappelant eut produit son intervention pour conserver la possession des machines, la demanderesse, dans sa r\u00e9ponse, indique en quoi consistait la pr\u00e9tendue possession des syndics, qui, depuis le 22 avril 1922, avaient refus\u00e9 ou n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de lui remettre ces machines, qui n\u2019avaient jamais appartenu \u00e0 Caron et Toupin, les faillis. Je crois donc que cette all\u00e9gation, m\u00eame si elle constituait un aveu, ne saurait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant et ne peut affecter la possession des objets lors de l\u2019incendie, plusieurs mois apr\u00e8s cette all\u00e9gation, vu qu\u2019elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans une proc\u00e9dure dirig\u00e9e non contre lui, mais contre les syndics \u00e0 la faillite. Dans la contestation de l\u2019intervention par la demanderesse, on ne peut relever aucune all\u00e9gation semblable, et le jugement se contente de renvoyer comme non fond\u00e9e en fait et en droit l\u2019intervention de \u013eappelant. Les amendements intervenus apr\u00e8s l\u2019incendie ont retroagi jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de la r\u00e9clamation et ne sauraient aider la pr\u00e9tention de l\u2019appelant. D\u2019ailleurs, suivant Demolombe, vol. 30, n\u00b0 450:\nCe qui caract\u00e9rise donc essentiellement \u013eaveu, c\u2019est, disons-nous, qu\u2019il est fait avec la volont\u00e9 formelle, avec l\u2019intention s\u00e9rieuse, de donner \u00e0 une autre personne le droit de s\u2019en pr\u00e9valoir comme d\u2019une preuve, en tenant le fait pour av\u00e9r\u00e9.\nD\u2019o\u00f9 il suit que toutes les d\u00e9clarations,, auxquelles ce caract\u00e8re manque, ne sauraient l\u00e9galement constituer un aveu, lors m\u00eame, bien entendu, qu\u2019elles seraient relatives au patrimoine et aux affaires de celui dont elles \u00e9manent.\nTelles sont, par exemple, les all\u00e9gations et les explications fournies par une partie \u00e0 l\u2019appui des moyens sur lesquels elle fonde sa demande ou sa d\u00e9fense. Ce sont l\u00e0 des armes, qu\u2019elle emploie dans son seul int\u00e9r\u00eat, et dont elle n\u2019entend certes pas se dessaisir au profit de son adversaire. Ce sont, en un mot, seulement des moyens, des arguments; ce ne sont point des aveux, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire des d\u00e9clarations faites avec l\u2019intention de fournir une preuve toute faite contre soi \u00e0 la partie adverse.\nAubry & Rau, vol. 8, sec. 751, p. 167, ajoute:\nL\u2019aveu (hoc sensu) est la d\u00e9claration par laquelle une personne reconna\u00eet pour vrai, et comme devant \u00eatre tenu pour av\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, un fait de nature \u00e0 produire contre elle des cons\u00e9quences juridiques.\nIl r\u00e9sulte de cette d\u00e9finition, que toutes esp\u00e8ces de d\u00e9claration faites par une personne relativement \u00e0 ses affaires ne constituent point des aveux, et qu\u2019on ne doit consid\u00e9rer comme tels que les d\u00e9clarations faites d\u2019une mani\u00e8re s\u00e9rieuse, et avec la pens\u00e9e que celui au profit duquel elles ont eu lieu se trouvera, en les invoquant,, dispens\u00e9 de prouver les faits qui en forment l\u2019objet. Ainsi, les all\u00e9gations faites par une partie \u00e0 l\u2019appui des moyens sur lesquels elle fonde sa demande ou sa d\u00e9fense ne sont point \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer comme des aveux, alors m\u00eame que ces all\u00e9gations se trouveraient consign\u00e9es dans un interrogatoire sur faits et articles, et qu\u2019elles auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Ainsi encore, les d\u00e9clarations faites par un t\u00e9moin, dans une proc\u00e9dure civile ou criminelle, ne forment pas des aveux.\nDu moment que nous \u00e9liminons le troisi\u00e8me moyen soulev\u00e9 par le procureur de \u013eappelant, l\u2019appel doit n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment aux deux jugements unanimes rendus en cette cause par la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nEn demandant \u00e0 cette cour de d\u00e9clarer qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en possession lors de \u013eincendie, Abran nous invite \u00e0 trouver contraire \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 sa r\u00e9clamation pour la valeur des machines, dans laquelle il affirmait que ces machines \u00e9taient dans la b\u00e2tisse incendi\u00e9e, lui appartenaient et \u00e9taient en sa possession \u00e0 la date du feu. D\u2019ailleurs, sans tenir compte des droits de retention qu\u2019il all\u00e9guait pour emp\u00eacher les syndics de remettre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, le seul fait qu\u2019il r\u00e9clamait un privil\u00e8ge de locateur d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il avait, comme tel, la possession de facto des machines qui garnissaient son immeuble.\nComme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 expos\u00e9, dans une cause de Manson v. Hartney Company Ltd. and Mayer[1]:\nCette mise en gage des objets apport\u00e9s par le locataire remonte au droit romain et au droit coutumier. Ce gage s\u2019\u00e9tablit tacitement par le seul fait de l\u2019entr\u00e9e en possession du preneur et l\u2019on peut dire qu\u2019il y a deux possessions superpos\u00e9es; celle du locataire et celle du bailleur; ce dernier acquiert sur les meubles de son locataire un titre de possession indirecte r\u00e9sultant de cette circonstance que ces meubles se trouvent dans son immeuble. De plus, le privil\u00e8ge frappe les meubles garnissant les lieux lou\u00e9s qui appartiennent \u00e0 un tiers ou qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9s par ce tiers au locataire, \u00e0 moins que le tiers propri\u00e9taire ait notifi\u00e9 au bailleur son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avant l\u2019introduction de l\u2019objet dans les lieux lou\u00e9s.\nL\u2019honorable juge-en-chef Lafontaine, Re: Miller v. Williams & Clement[2] disait:\nIl est de principe que le privil\u00e8ge du locateur frappe d\u00e8s leur entr\u00e9e dans l\u2019immeuble lou\u00e9 les meubles qui le garnissent, m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019ils appartiennent \u00e0 des tiers et que ce privil\u00e8ge a pour base un nantissement de fait qui subsiste aussi longtemps que le locateur d\u2019une part conserve la possession, \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire, de l\u2019immeuble lou\u00e9 et aussi longtemps d\u2019autre part que les meubles qui l\u2019ont garni y restent d\u00e9pos\u00e9s, le locateur \u00e9tant dans la situation d\u2019un cr\u00e9ancier gagiste, dont le privil\u00e8ge demeure et se conserve par lui-m\u00eame, sans qu\u2019il soit besoin d\u2019aucune proc\u00e9dure judiciaire, aussi longtemps que le gage a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis et est rest\u00e9 en la possession d\u2019un cr\u00e9ancier gagiste.\nIl me para\u00eet \u00e9vident que, par son intervention, \u013eappelant a voulu, au moins, garder la possession des machines qu\u2019il consid\u00e9rait comme gage garantissant son loyer. Il est bien vrai que cette intervention et cette demande \u00e9taient clairement de mauvaise foi. Il savait, depuis la premi\u00e8re assembl\u00e9e des cr\u00e9anciers, que ces appareils appartenaient \u00e0 la demanderesse; et, par sa lettre du 30 mars 1922, adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la demanderesse,, il informait cette derni\u00e8re qu\u2019il \u00e9tait devenu propri\u00e9taire du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National, au Cap de la Madeleine, et qu\u2019il d\u00e9sirait la voir le plus t\u00f4t possible au sujet des machines. L\u2019appelant savait donc, avant m\u00eame de donner \u00e0 bail ce th\u00e9\u00e2tre, que les machines qui s\u2019y trouvaient \u00e9taient la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la demanderesse. Il a voulu, de concert avec les syndics, garder et utiliser, de propos d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, pour son profit et avantage, le bien d\u2019autrui, sans en payer le prix.\nBien plus, il a eu l\u2019audace d\u2019assurer cette machinerie contre le feu comme \u00e9tant sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Il en a re\u00e7u la valeur des compagnies d\u2019assurance; et il pr\u00e9tend aujourd\u2019hui ne pas \u00eatre tenu d\u2019indemniser le propri\u00e9taire, qui, n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 son intervention \u00e9videmment vexatoire dans la faillite, aurait obtenu d\u00e8s septembre 1922, avec le consentement des syndics, sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, remise des machines. Par cette r\u00e9clamation intempestive, l\u2019appelant s\u2019est mis lui-m\u00eame en demeure et en d\u00e9faut et doit, en cons\u00e9quence, subir les cons\u00e9quences de la perte par incendie des objets qu\u2019il d\u00e9tenait injustement. Il n\u2019a ni all\u00e9gu\u00e9, ni prouv\u00e9, cas fortuit ou que la chose aurait \u00e9galement p\u00e9ri en la possession du cr\u00e9ancier (art. 1200 C.C.). Il est clair, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les t\u00e9moignages des syndics, que les locataires et sous-locataires d\u00e9tenaient et exploitaient les machines pour Abran, qui produisit son intervention pour justifier et prolonger le retard des syndics \u00e0 se rendre \u00e0 la juste demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nL\u2019appelant, \u00e0 l\u2019audition orale, a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que le demandeur par intervention fait valoir un droit d\u2019action qui ne saurait \u00eatre c\u00e9d\u00e9 et, qu\u2019\u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, il a acquis un droit litigieux, sujet \u00e0 certaines restrictions. Son. m\u00e9moire suppl\u00e9mentaire ne mentionne pas ces deux moyens. Je ne sais s\u2019il y renonce implicitement, mais je les crois mal fond\u00e9s. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a acquis l\u2019universalit\u00e9 des biens et cr\u00e9ances de la compagnie demanderesse en liquidation au cours de l\u2019instance et avait droit de se substituer \u00e0 elle pour obtenir jugement sur l\u2019action originaire demandant livraison des machines d\u00e9tenues ill\u00e9galement ou leur valeur (art. 1200 C.C). Nous pouvons dire que toutes les cr\u00e9ances qui font partie d\u2019un patrimoine peuvent, \u00e0 moins d\u2019une exception formelle contenue dans une disposition l\u00e9gislative, \u00eatre l\u2019objet d\u2019une cession-transport. Dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, nous avons l\u2019acte des liquidateurs qui autorise pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la vente de l\u2019actif d\u2019une compagnie; et, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de la Cour du Banc du Roi re Brossard v. Banque du Peuple et DeSerres[3],\nla vente et le transport en bloc des biens, effets et droits mobiliers de la compagnie, soit aux ench\u00e8res publiques, soit par vente priv\u00e9e, est un moyen de liquidation autoris\u00e9 par la loi et l\u2019autorit\u00e9 judiciaire; cette liquidation, n\u00e9cessaire et en ob\u00e9issance \u00e0 la loi, participe beaucoup du caract\u00e8re des ventes judiciaires, et il r\u00e9pugnerait de consid\u00e9rer pareille vente comme celle de droits litigieux.\nMais l\u2019article 1582 C.C. ne peut \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, car le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019a jamais demand\u00e9 le retrait et offert de rembourser \u00e0 l\u2019intervenant intim\u00e9 le prix de vente avec frais et loyaux co\u00fbts et les int\u00e9r\u00eats. L\u2019appelant a contest\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ance au m\u00e9rite et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019argument devant cette cour, il n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 question de retrait; or, \u0440\u043eur exercer ce retrait, il faut le demander par la d\u00e9fense. Le but du retrait litigieux \u00e9tant de mettre fin au proc\u00e8s, il est inadmissible que le retrayant pousse le proc\u00e8s jusqu\u2019au bout et n\u2019exerce le retrait qu\u2019apr\u00e8s que le droit aura cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre litigieux par la d\u00e9cision sur le fond. 19 Baudry-Lacantinerie et Saignat, p. 952; 7 Mignault, 203.\nJe n\u2019ai donc aucune h\u00e9sitation \u00e0 renvoyer l\u2019appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Lamont J.J. was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014Les faits de ce litige sont compliqu\u00e9s. La multiplicit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures et les nombreux amendements n\u2019ont pas eu pour r\u00e9sultat de simplifier la situation.\nTel qu\u2019il se pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 cette cour, apr\u00e8s deux appels \u00e0 la Cour du Banc du Roi et au moment de ce second appel \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame, l\u2019intervenant George F. Perkins demande que le d\u00e9fendeur Abran soit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 lui payer la valeur de certains appareils cin\u00e9matographiques qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truits dans un incendie, alors que, suivant la pr\u00e9tention de Perkins, Abran \u00e9tait en demeure de lui en faire la livraison.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi a maintenu l\u2019intervention et a condamn\u00e9 Abran \u00e0 payer. Ce dernier a pr\u00e9tendu que le jugement devrait \u00eatre infirm\u00e9, pour plusieurs raisons dont nous avons maintenant \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si elles sont fond\u00e9es.\nLe 26 ao\u00fbt 1921, J.-A. Caron, alors seul propri\u00e9taire du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National, situ\u00e9 au Cap de la Madeleine, province de Qu\u00e9bec, a achet\u00e9 de George F. Perkins, qui faisait alors affaires sous le nom de Perkins Electric Company, des machines de cin\u00e9ma, qu\u2019il installa dans son th\u00e9\u00e2tre. Cette acquisition fut faite au moyen d\u2019un de ces contrats en vertu desquels le vendeur demeure propri\u00e9taire jusqu\u2019\u00e0 paiement int\u00e9gral du prix de vente.\nAlors que le prix de vente n\u2019avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 et que, par cons\u00e9quent, Perkins Electric Company \u00e9tait encore propri\u00e9taire des machines, J.-A, Caron, le 20 d\u00e9cembre 1921, vendit son th\u00e9\u00e2tre \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 au docteur C.-A. Bouchard. Les machines \u00e9taient dans le th\u00e9\u00e2tre au moment de cette vente.\nLe 21 janvier 1922, J.-A. Caron fit un acte de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avec J.-Henri Toupin, sous le nom de Caron & Toupin. Dans l\u2019intervalle, Perkins Electric Company \u00e9tait devenu The Perkins Ladd Electric Limited.\nLe 24 f\u00e9vrier 1922, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Caron & Toupin acheta de The Perkins Ladd Electric Limited les trois machines cin\u00e9matographiques dont il s\u2019agit dans la pr\u00e9sente cause. Elle le fit au moyen d\u2019un contrat semblable \u00e0 celui qui \u00e9tait intervenu dans le premier cas, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que le vendeur demeurait propri\u00e9taire des machines jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elles fussent enti\u00e8rement pay\u00e9es par les acheteurs. En plus, The Perkins Ladd Electric Limited reprit les machines qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 vendues \u00e0 Caron le 26 ao\u00fbt 1921. Il est \u00e0 noter qu a cette date le prix d\u2019achat de celles-ci n\u2019avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement acquitt\u00e9 et que Caron, ou la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Caron & Toupin, n\u2019en \u00e9tait pas encore devenu propri\u00e9taire. Aussi The Perkins Ladd Electric Limited se contenta-t-elle de cr\u00e9diter sur le prix d\u2019achat des nouvelles machines le montant qui avait jusqu\u2019alors \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 en acompte en vertu du premier contrat.\nCaron n\u00e9gligea d\u2019exercer son droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, et le docteur Bouchard devint le propri\u00e9taire irr\u00e9vocable du th\u00e9\u00e2tre (art. 1550 C.C.). Le 25 mars 1922, il vendit le th\u00e9\u00e2tre \u00e0 Abran.\nLe 22 avril 1922, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Caron & Toupin fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9e en faillite, et MM. Damphousse & H\u00e9bert furent nomm\u00e9s syndics. Par lettres patentes suppl\u00e9mentaires, le nom The Perkins Ladd Electric Limited avait \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9 en celui de Perkins Electric Limited. D\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9union des inspecteurs de la faillite, \u00e0 laquelle Abran assistait, Perkins Electric Limited fit valoir ses droits de propri\u00e9taire aux machines cin\u00e9matographiques qui \u00e9taient dans le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National. Ces droits furent expliqu\u00e9s et \u00e9tablis; et, de ce moment, Abran en fut pleinement inform\u00e9.\nPar diverses lettres \u00e9crites directement, ou par l\u2019entremise de ses avocats, Perkins Electric Limited r\u00e9clama la possession des machines. Mais les syndics \u00e0 la faillite de Caron & Toupin et le propri\u00e9taire du th\u00e9\u00e2tre, Abran, se rendant compte qu\u2019ils pourraient faire une vente plus avantageuse si les machines restaient dans le th\u00e9\u00e2tre, agirent de concert pour en retarder la remise aussi longtemps que possible. C\u2019est alors que Perkins Electric Limited fit une requ\u00eate demandant qu\u2019il f\u00fbt d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait la propri\u00e9taire des machines cin\u00e9matographiques en question, et que la possession lui en f\u00fbt attribu\u00e9e.\nCette requ\u00eate \u00e9tait dirig\u00e9e contre les syndics. Ils d\u00e9cid\u00e8rent de ne pas la contester et de la laisser accorder. Sur pr\u00e9sentation de la requ\u00eate, ils consentirent \u00e0 ce que la compagnie Perkins reprit possession; mais la compagnie en fut emp\u00each\u00e9e par suite du refus d\u2019Abran, qui, effectivement, produisit une intervention demandant le renvoi de la requ\u00eate. Les raisons qu\u2019Abran invoquait \u00e9taient les suivantes:\nComme subrog\u00e9 aux droits de son vendeur Bouchard, il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire des machines qui avaient fait l\u2019objet du premier contrat avec la compagnie Perkins et que cette derni\u00e8re avait reprises lors de la deuxi\u00e8me vente. Il ajourtait\nque m\u00eame si la requ\u00e9rante (Perkins Electric Limited) \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire des machineries qu\u2019elle r\u00e9clame, l\u2019intervenant aurait son privil\u00e8ge de locateur sur lesdits effets mobiliers n\u2019ayant jamais connu le fait que ladite requ\u00e9rante \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire desdits effets. L\u2019intervention \u010fAbran porte la date du 10 octobre 1922. Elle fut rejet\u00e9e par un jugement, en date du 2 avril 1924, qui d\u00e9clarait que Perkins Electric Limited avait toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 propri\u00e9taire des machines qu\u2019elle r\u00e9clamait par sa requ\u00eate, qu\u2019Abran n\u2019avait nullement justifi\u00e9 ses pr\u00e9tentions, qu\u2019il n\u2019avait aucun droit sur les machines originaires ou sur celles qui les avaient remplac\u00e9es, qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il lui f\u00fbt d\u00fb quoi que ce f\u00fbt pour loyer au moment de la requ\u00eate de Perkins Electric Limited, et que son intervention \u00e9tait mal fond\u00e9e en fait et en droit. Il n\u2019y eut pas d\u2019appel de ce jugement.\nMais, lorsque Perkins Electric Limited vint subs\u00e9quemment pour prendre possession de ces machines, elle fut inform\u00e9e que, au cours de la contestation, \u00e0 savoir le 26 d\u00e9cembre 1922, le th\u00e9\u00e2tre et les machines avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truites par un incendie.\nC\u2019est dans ces circonstances que Perkins Electric Limited intenta son action contre Abran, concluant que ce dernier f\u00fbt condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 lui payer la valeur des machines.\nIl n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de relater toutes les proc\u00e9dures et les appels qui se sont produits depuis. Ils n\u2019ont pas modifi\u00e9 la nature de cette action par laquelle la demanderesse all\u00e9guait qu\u2019Abran \u00e9tait en demeure de lui remettre la possession des machines lorsqu\u2019elles furent d\u00e9truites par l\u2019incendie et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il \u00e9tait maintenant tenu d\u2019en payer la valeur.\nPar deux fois la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la n\u00e9gative et la Cour du Banc du Roi a unanimement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans l\u2019affirmative. Le jugement de la Cour Supr\u00eame qui est intervenu entre les deux appels avait simplement ordonn\u00e9 un nouveau proc\u00e8s par suite d\u2019insuffisance dans les all\u00e9gations et dans la preuve.\nDepuis que la pr\u00e9sente cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 commenc\u00e9e, George F. Perkins a \u00e9t\u00e9 substitu\u00e9 \u00e0 Perkins Electric Limited par suite du fait que cette derni\u00e8re avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en liquidation et que, le 25 octobre 1926, le liquidateur lui avait c\u00e9d\u00e9.\nall the assets of the said Perkins Electric Limited in liquidation, including * * * bills and accounts receivable * * * the good will of the business, all claims, demands and rights of action, bad debts and other assets belonging to, or possessed by the said company * * * with an absolute right on the part of the purchaser to ask, demand, sue for and recover the said debts, claims and demands, and every one of them, and to give effectual receipts and discharge thereof. Cette vente fut effectu\u00e9e par le liquidateur avec \u013eavis des inspecteurs de la liquidation et \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une autorisation judiciaire qui lui fut donn\u00e9e par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure du district de Montr\u00e9al.\nA l\u2019audition devant cette cour, \u013eappelant Abran a pr\u00e9tendu que Perkins n\u2019\u00e9tait pas valablement saisi de la cr\u00e9ance; que c\u2019\u00e9tait d\u2019ailleurs un droit litigieux qui ne pouvait faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une cession; qu\u2019il ne pouvait \u00eatre tenu responsable en dommages du fait qu\u2019il aurait fait valoir ses droits devant les tribunaux; que, lors de l\u2019incendie, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en possession des machines, et que, sur ce point, il pouvait invoquer l\u2019admission de la compagnie Perkins elle-m\u00eame dans sa requ\u00eate pour r\u00e9clamer les machines des syndics.\nLa seule objection d\u2019Abran qui m\u00e9rite notre attention est celle o\u00f9 il nie sa responsabilit\u00e9 sous pr\u00e9texte qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en possession des machines lors de \u013eincendie.\nNous pouvons tr\u00e8s rapidement disposer de toutes les autres. Le liquidateur de Perkins Electric Limited a vendu \u00e0 Perkins toutes les cr\u00e9ances et droits d\u2019actions de la compagnie. La validit\u00e9 d\u2019une pareille vente est reconnue par la loi (art. 1570 C.C.) et fut autoris\u00e9e par la cour. La r\u00e9clamation dont il s\u2019agit tombait dans la cat\u00e9gorie des cr\u00e9ances et droits d\u2019actions. La compagnie Perkins avait m\u00eame d\u00e9j\u00e0 intent\u00e9 son action lors de la vente de cette cr\u00e9ance par le liquidateur \u00e0 Perkins. Ce dernier a acquis un titre parfaitement l\u00e9gal et valide. Il ne lui restait plus qu\u2019\u00e0 faire la proc\u00e9dure n\u00e9cessaire, comme il l\u2019a fait, pour que son nom f\u00fbt substitu\u00e9 \u00e0 celui de Perkins Electric Limited.\nIl est vrai qu\u2019au moment de cette vente le droit \u00e9tait incertain, disput\u00e9 par son d\u00e9biteur, et que la demande en \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 intent\u00e9e en justice. Le droit \u00e9tait donc r\u00e9put\u00e9 litigieux (art. 1583 C.C.). Mais\nla cession par adjudication de cr\u00e9ances litigieuses d\u00e9pendant d\u2019une faillite, ou la cession de cr\u00e9ances comprises dans la vente d\u2019une universalit\u00e9 de biens ou de cr\u00e9ances, n\u2019est pas soumise au retrait.\n(Guilbault v. Desmarais[4]; Brossard v. Banque du Peuple et Gaspard Deserres)[5].\nEn outre, m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un droit litigieux soumis au retrait, celui de qui il est r\u00e9clam\u00e9 peut en \u00eatre d\u00e9charg\u00e9 seulement. en remboursant \u00e0 \u013eacheteur le prix de vente avec les frais et loyaux co\u00fbts et les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur le prix \u00e0 compter du jour que le paiement en a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. (Art. 1582 C.C.)\net, pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de cette disposition de la loi, le d\u00e9biteur doit s\u2019en pr\u00e9valoir d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du litige en faisant des offres pures et simples et sans condition du prix de vente qu\u2019il lui incombait ainsi de rembourser (McNaughton v. Irvine)[6]. Le but de cette disposition de la loi est de mettre fin au proc\u00e8s \u00e0 son origine. Si le d\u00e9biteur ne s\u2019en pr\u00e9vaut pas in limine, ce but ne peut plus \u00eatre atteint; et il est trop tard pour essayer de faire valoir ce moyen apr\u00e8s que le d\u00e9biteur a contest\u00e9 l\u2019action (19 Baudry-Lacantinerie, p. 952; 24 Laurent n\u00b0 602). Nous mentionnons ce dernier pr\u00e9cepte uniquement pour d\u00e9montrer les limites de ce moyen de d\u00e9fense. Nous n\u2019avons m\u00eame pas besoin d\u2019en parler ici, puisque, \u00e0 aucune phase de la proc\u00e9dure et pas m\u00eame depuis que la cause est en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 devant nous, \u013eappelant n\u2019a rempli les conditions n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00eatre en mesure d\u2019invoquer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des articles 1582 et suivants. La question du retrait litigieux ne se pose m\u00eame pas.\nIl en est de m\u00eame de la pr\u00e9tendue admission que Perkins Electric Limited aurait faite dans sa requ\u00eate originaire pour revendiquer la possession des machines. Elle a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que, lors de la faillite de Caron & Toupin, les syndics avaient pris possession et avaient depuis conserv\u00e9 possession des machines. Une all\u00e9gation n\u2019est pas une admission: elle est une pr\u00e9tention de fait ou un argument de droit. Elle ne constitue un aveu que si (suivant l\u2019expression de Aubry & Rau, vol. 8, p. 167, n\u00b0 751) elle\nreconna\u00eet pour vrai et comme devant \u00eatre tenu pour av\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9gard un fait de nature \u00e0 produire contre (la personne qui la fait) des cons\u00e9quences juridiques.\nC\u2019est ainsi que l\u2019entend Pothier (Obligations, n\u00b0 831). Il n\u2019y avait aucun aveu dans l\u2019all\u00e9gation de la compagnie Perkins que les syndics \u00e9taient en possession des machines. Elle invoquait par l\u00e0 un simple moyen de fait, que les syndics pouvaient ou non contester, mais dont, au moins pour les fins de ce litige, il n\u2019y avait pas lieu de demander acte. D\u2019ailleurs, comme nous allons le voir plus loin, toute cette situation a \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9e par le fait m\u00eame de l\u2019appelant, lorsqu\u2019il a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos d\u2019intervenir sur la requ\u00eate pour possession. Enfin, traiter Faction de Perkins comme une demande en dommages r\u00e9sultant du fait que \u013eappelant aurait tent\u00e9 d\u2019exercer un droit devant les tribunaux, c\u2019est d\u00e9placer compl\u00e8tement la question. Il ne s\u2019agit pas ici d\u2019une action en dommages; et Perkins ne demande pas une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 contre Abran pour avoir contest\u00e9 sa requ\u00eate en possession. Il r\u00e9clame l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une obligation en vertu de laquelle Abran est devenu son d\u00e9biteur, l\u2019obligation de remettre les machines qu\u2019il d\u00e9tenait. \u201cA la place d\u2019une ex\u00e9cution r\u00e9elle, qui n\u2019est plus possible\u201d, Perkins exige \u201cune ex\u00e9cution fictive, une ex\u00e9cution en argent\u201d (Baudry-Lacantinerie, 2e \u00e9d. tome 3, n\u00b0 1918). Comme cons\u00e9quence du jugement de la cour, Abran ne sera pas puni; il sera simplement contraint \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter son obligation de la seule fa\u00e7on dont cette ex\u00e9cution soit encore possible, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire en payant l\u2019\u00e9quivalent p\u00e9cuniaire de la valeur des machines d\u00e9truites par l\u2019incendie. L\u2019effet de la demeure est de le rendre tenu d\u2019indemniser \u201cencore qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait aucune faute de sa part.\u201d (Planiol, Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de droit civil, 8e \u00e9d. vol. 2, n\u00b0 625).\nBien que l\u2019objet ait p\u00e9ri, l\u2019obligation subsiste. Elle est \u201cperp\u00e9tu\u00e9e\u201d, suivant l\u2019expression des jurisconsultes romains (Baudry-Lacantinerie, loco citato). L\u2019action que prend le cr\u00e9ancier, en pareil cas, n\u2019est rien autre chose qu\u2019une demande de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019obligation.\nIl ne reste plus qu\u2019\u00e0 se demander si, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, comme l\u2019a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la Cour du Banc du Roi \u00e0 deux reprises, l\u2019action \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e. Nous sommes d\u2019avis qu\u2019elle l\u2019\u00e9tait.\nLa compagnie Perkins a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 la possession de ces machines par requ\u00eate devant la cour. Les syndics ont imm\u00e9diatement consenti \u00e0 ce que les machines fussent remises. En autant qu\u2019ils avaient la possession, comme repr\u00e9sentant les droits de Caron & Toupin, ils l\u2019ont abandonn\u00e9e et en ont effectu\u00e9 la d\u00e9livrance \u00e0 la compagnie, au sens m\u00eame du code. Ils ont \u201cconsenti qu\u2019elle en prenne possession, tous obstacles en \u00e9tant \u00e9cart\u00e9s\u201d. (Art. C.C. 1493.) Ils n\u2019avaient plus l\u2019animus possidendi.\nA partir de ce moment, rien n\u2019emp\u00eachait plus la compagnie Perkins de prendre les machines et de les transporter dans ses magasins. Si elles eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e0 lors de l\u2019incendie du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National, elles n\u2019auraient pas p\u00e9ri. Mais Abran est intervenu. Il a contest\u00e9 le droit de la compagnie \u00e0 la possession des machines. Il en avait, en somme, la possession physique, puisque les machines \u00e9taient dans son th\u00e9\u00e2tre. Du moment qu\u2019il a produit son intervention, il en a, au moins, assum\u00e9 la d\u00e9tention au sens de la loi. Il affirmait son droit \u00e0 cette d\u00e9tention sous pr\u00e9texte qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenu de les laisser aller avant que la compagnie Perkins e\u00fbt remis les machines qu\u2019elle avait reprises lors du second contrat, et sous pr\u00e9texte \u00e9galement qu\u2019il avait un droit privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 pour le paiement du loyer qu\u2019il pr\u00e9tendait lui \u00eatre d\u00fb.\nLe litige pour la possession des machines s\u2019est donc engag\u00e9 de ce moment entre la compagnie Perkins, qui les r\u00e9clamait, et Abran, qui les d\u00e9tenait et qui ne voulait pas les laisser aller.\nEn gardant et en retenant les machines, Abran encourait l\u2019obligation de les remettre si le jugement sur la requ\u00eate en revendication les attribuait \u00e0 la compagnie Perkins.\nC\u2019est ce qui s\u2019est produit. La cour a reconnu les droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la compagnie et a ordonn\u00e9 de la remettre en possession des machines. Cet ordre s\u2019adressait \u00e0 la seule personne qui avait contest\u00e9 le droit \u00e0 la possession et qui les d\u00e9tenait depuis que la contestation \u00e9tait li\u00e9e sur l\u2019intervention. Cet ordre s\u2019adressait donc \u00e0 Abran.\nSon intervention n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produite dans le but d\u2019appuyer les droits des syndics, que d\u2019ailleurs ces derniers avaient cess\u00e9 d\u2019affirmer. Son intervention avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite pour son propre compte, dans le but de faire reconna\u00eetre ses droits \u00e0 lui. Etant le seul qui, d\u00e8s lors, gardait et retenait les machines, il encourait par le fait m\u00eame l\u2019obligation de les rendre, du moment que son droit de r\u00e9tention n\u2019\u00e9tait pas reconnu. Le jugement sur la requ\u00eate en revendication ayant d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas de droit de r\u00e9tention, il est devenu d\u00e9biteur de l\u2019obligation de rendre; et c\u2019est l\u00e0 que l\u2019article 1200 du code civil entre en jeu.\nAu moment o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu d\u2019accomplir l\u2019obligation de rendre, les machines qui faisaient l\u2019objet de cette obligation avaient p\u00e9ri. Il a donc invoqu\u00e9 l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter son obligation. Mais l\u2019article 1200 du code civil dit que, en pareil cas, l\u2019obligation est \u00e9teinte seulement lorsque \u201cl\u2019objet * * * p\u00e9rit * * * avant que (le d\u00e9biteur) soit en demeure\u201d, ou \u201clors m\u00eame que le d\u00e9biteur est en demeure, dans le cas o\u00f9 la chose serait \u00e9galement p\u00e9rie en la possession du cr\u00e9ancier\u201d.\nM\u00eame en admettant\u2014ce qui dans la pr\u00e9sente cause n\u2019est ni all\u00e9gu\u00e9, ni prouv\u00e9, et ce qui ne peut se pr\u00e9sumer\u2014que l\u2019incendie f\u00fbt un cas fortuit, Abran ne peut pas l\u2019invoquer ici, parce que, par son intervention, il s\u2019est mis en demeure de livrer les biens revendiqu\u00e9s, au cas o\u00f9 le jugement lui serait d\u00e9favorable.\nComme il n\u2019est pas \u201cdans le cas o\u00f9 la chose serait \u00e9galement p\u00e9rie en la possession du cr\u00e9ancier\u201d, il n\u2019est pas lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de l\u2019obligation de rendre; et il doit la valeur des machines, non pas comme punition pour avoir eu recours aux tribunaux, mais comme cons\u00e9quence de l\u2019obligation dont l\u2019ex\u00e9cution est demand\u00e9e par l\u2019action et qui, dans les circonstances, s\u2019est \u201cperp\u00e9tu\u00e9e\u201d. Il n\u2019est pas dans un des cas pr\u00e9vus par l\u2019article 1200, .o\u00f9 le. d\u00e9biteur est lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de son obligation pour cause d\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019ex\u00e9cution par suite de la perte de la chose.\nC\u2019est donc \u00e0 bon droit que la Cour du Banc du Roi l\u2019a condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 payer \u00e0 Perkins la valeur des machines d\u00e9truite, et son jugement doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lafleur, MacDougall, MacFarlane & Barclay.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Chauvin, Meagher, Walker & Stewart.\n[1] [1929] Q.R. 47 K.B. 148, at 152.\n[2] [1922] Q.R. 61 S.C. 184, at 186.\n[3] [1903] Q.R. 13 K.B. 148.\n[4] [1889] 18 R.L. 516.\n[5] [1903] Q.R. 13 K.B. 148.\n[6] [1926] S.C.R. 8.\n"}

Judgment of Cannon J., ante, p. 503, reversed.\nThe rule established by Williams v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co. (36 Can. S.C.R. 321) and other cases, that a decision by a judge of this court in chambers granting or refusing, on the merits, an application for leave to appeal is not appealable to the Court, does not extend to a case where the judge has granted leave to appeal in disregard of some essential statutory condition of the right of the applicant to have his application for leave heard and passed upon, or to a case where the judge, owing to a misunderstanding touching the effect of a statute, decides that an applicant for leave to appeal is not entitled to have his application heard, although in truth he has complied with all the statutory and other prerequisites of such an application.\nMOTION by way of appeal from the decision of Cannon J. in chambers[1], dismissing an application for special leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[2], dismissing an appeal taken from the judgment of Barry, C.J.K.B., sitting in bankruptcy[3]; the ground of the decision of Cannon J. being that he had no jurisdiction to hear the application, as the time fixed by Bankruptcy Rule 72 for such an application had expired, and that the order of Barry, C.J.K.B., as the judge sitting in bankruptcy, granting an extension of time for such application, was made without jurisdiction.\nThe judgment of the Court on the present motion was that the decision of the Judge in Chambers to the effect that the applicants were not entitled to apply for leave to appeal be rescinded; and that the applicants might proceed with their application; the costs of the abortive application before the Judge in Chambers to be costs in the application, and the costs of the proceedings before the Full Court to be costs to the applicants in any event of the application.\nL. A. Forsyth K.C. for the motion.\nE. H. Charlson, contra.\nThe Court.\u2014 We have come to the conclusion that Barry, C.J.K.B., as the judge sitting in bankruptcy had authority to grant an extension of time for applying for special leave to appeal to this Court.\nSection 163, subsection 5, of the Bankruptcy Act is in these terms:\n5. Where by this Act, or by General Rules, the time for doing any act or thing is limited, the court may extend the time either before or after the expiration thereof, upon such terms, if any, as the court may think fit to impose.\nBy sec. 174 an appeal is given to any person dissatisfied with an order or decision of the court or a judge in proceedings under the Act. By subsec. 2 of sec. 174 it is enacted that the decision of the Appeal Court shall be final unless \u201cspecial leave to appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court of Canada is obtained from a judge of that court.\u201d By sec. 161 the Governor in Council is authorized to make general rules, \u201cnot inconsistent with the terms of this Act, for carrying into effect the objects thereof.\u201d By Rule 72 of the general rules made pursuant to the authority conferred by sec. 161, it is provided as follows:\n72. An application for special leave to appeal from a decision of the Appeal Court and to fix the security for costs, if any, shall be made to a Judge of the Supreme Court of Canada within thirty days after the pronouncing of the decision complained of and notice of such application shall be served on the other party at least fourteen days before the hearing thereof.\nSubsec. 5 of sec. 163 confers upon the Bankruptcy Court a power, the ambit of which embraces \u201cany act or thing\u201d the time for \u201cdoing\u201d which is limited by \u201cthis Act or by General Rules.\u201d Ex facie an application under sec. 174 to which Rule 72 applies, is within that ambit.\nMoreover, sec. 163 is found in Part VII, which embraces the sections beginning with sec. 152 and ending with sec. 174. The scope of Part VII is indicated by the general heading \u201cCourts and Procedure\u201d; and sec. 174, which is the last of the sections within the part, deals with the subject of appeals, including appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada. Sec. 163 is one of a fascicle of provisions under the subhead \u201cProcedure.\u201d In passing, it may be observed, that while the right of appeal is, speaking generally, not matter of procedure but of substantive law, the rules regulating the various steps in initiating and prosecuting an appeal are rules of procedure; and regulation 72 is a rule of that character.\nIt is, of course, the duty of a court or judge, in construing subsec. 5 of sec. 163, to give effect to the language of the subsection according to the ordinary sense of the words selected by the legislature to express its intention; unless there is to be found in some qualifying context, or in the subject matter or general purpose and object of the statute, sufficient ground for ascribing to it another reading. Our attention has not been drawn to anything of the kind; and of course judicial tribunals cannot act upon vague notions, not susceptible of definite statement, as to the intention of the legislature, and there is no consideration, arising out of the general scope of the legislation and capable of being so formulated, to justify a departure from the construction that is dictated by the ordinary meaning of the words.\nWe agree with the view expressed by Ritchie, C.J., and Strong, J., in In re Sproule[4], that where \u201cjurisdiction is conferred on a judge in chambers a right to revise his decision is impliedly conferred on the court unless there is something in the subject matter or context leading to a contrary conclusion.\u201d In Williams v. Grand Trunk Ry. Co.[5], it was held that no appeal lies to the Full Court from a refusal on the merits of an application for leave to appeal from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners under the provisions of the Railway Act. It has many times been held for obvious reasons that a decision by a judge in chambers dealing with an application for leave to appeal on the merits, whether granting or refusing the application, is not appealable. The chief purpose in requiring leave to appeal is to prevent frivolous and unnecessary appeals, a purpose which would, in great degree, be frustrated if an appeal were permitted from such a decision. Authorities giving effect to this view are cited in the judgment of Taschereau, C.J., in Williams\u2019 case[6] and need not be reproduced here.\nBut Williams\u2019 case6 should not be regarded as governing cases in which the judge in chambers has granted an application for leave to appeal in disregard of some essential statutory condition of the right of the applicant to have his application for leave heard and passed upon. It was in pursuance of this principle that this court, recently, in Montreal Tramways Company v. C.N.R.[7], held that an appellant who had obtained an order for leave to appeal, without giving notice of an application for leave and without affording the respondent an opportunity to answer such an application, was not entitled to proceed with his appeal without obtaining leave upon a proper proceeding. For similar reasons that authority does not extend to a case where a judge in chambers, owing to a misunderstanding touching the effect of a statute, decides that an applicant for leave to appeal is not entitled to have his application heard, although in truth he has complied with all the statutory and other prerequisites of such an application.\nThe order of the learned judge in chambers will be set aside and the applicant will be entitled to proceed with his application.\nMotion granted accordingly.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W.

The present appeal was by the Government of Alberta from the Board\u2019s acceptance, as being in compliance with its order, of the rates published by the Canadian National Rys.; the appellant asserting that certain of those rates contravened the order, and that, in any case, under s. 325 of the Railway Act, they could not be sanctioned or charged.\nHeld (1): What was required of the Canadian National Rys. under Order 448 was to adjust its rates in such a way that in territory competitive as between it and the Canadian Pacific Ry. Co. grain shippers in such territory would be placed on as equal a rate basis as possible, all things considered; and the Canadian National Rys., in adopting the mileage grouping in effect from the nearest point, parallel or contiguous, main or branch line station, on the Canadian Pacific, had complied with the order.\n(2): The Board\u2019s order (construed as above) and the Board\u2019s allowance of the rates in question (fixed on above basis) were within its powers. As rightly interpreted by the Board, the effect of subs. 5 and 6 of s. 325 of the Railway Act, 1919 (as amended, 1925, c. 52) was, not that in applying the Crow\u2019s Nest Pass agreement rates on grain and flour to all railways in the territory the proper standard was of a per mileage basis (the Crow\u2019s Nest Pass agreement, and c. 5 of 1897, pursuant to which it was made, discussed and explained in this connection), but, in the given territory, to establish a relationship between the rates on the Canadian Pacific governed by the Crow\u2019s Nest Pass Act and agreement and the rates on other railways, which would put on an equal footing all persons and localities situated under substantially similar circumstances; in attempting to secure a fair and reasonable rate structure, account should be taken of the equivalent or competitive points as between the railways.\nAPPEAL by the Government of the Province of Alberta from the Order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, No. 45846, dated November 25, 1930, refusing the application of the appellant for an order directing that the Canadian National Railways should forthwith publish, file, and put into effect tariffs on grain and flour from certain points on its railway system to Fort William, Port Arthur, Westport and Armstrong, Ontario, and from certain points on its railway system to Vancouver, British Columbia, for export, at certain rates set out in statements annexed to the application.\nThe appellant had submitted in its application to the Board, that the rates between the said points, published by the Canadian National Railways, contravened the Board\u2019s General Order No. 448, dated August 26, 1927.\nThe Board granted leave of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada upon the following questions of law, namely:\n\u201c(1) Whether as a matter of law the Canadian National Railways have any right to charge the rates in the said application complained of?\n\u201c(2) Whether as a matter of law the Board has any right to allow the Canadian National Railways to charge the rates in the application complained of?\n\u201c(3) Whether as a matter of law the rates complained of in the said application do not contravene the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of General Order No. 448, dated 26th August, 1927?\u201d\nThe said Order No. 448, and other matters leading to the present appeal or bearing on the questions now in issue, are sufficiently set out in the judgments now reported.\nAs pointed out on behalf of the appellant, the questions of law Nos. 1 and 2 raised the matter of the right of the Railway Company, having regard to the provisions of s. 325 of the Railway Act, 1919 (as amended, 1925, c. 52), to charge the rates complained of, and the jurisdiction of the Board to allow the Company to do so.\nLeave was granted to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to intervene as a respondent. By the judgment of this Court, now reported, questions 1 and 2 were answered in the affirmative, and question 3 in the negative, and the appeal was dismissed with costs.\nS. B. Woods, K.C., for the Government of the Province of Alberta.\nW. N. Tilley, K.C., for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Canadian National Railways (with him, E. P. Flintoft, K.C., for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, and Alistair Fraser, K.C., for the Canadian National Railways).\nDuff, J.\u2014I concur with the conclusions of Mr. Justice Rinfret.\nThe appeal involves the construction of subsections 5 and 6 of section 325 of the Railway Act. The subsections are as follows:\n5. Notwithstanding the provisions of section three of this Act the powers given to the Board under this Act to fix, determine and enforce just and reasonable rates, and to change and alter rates as changing conditions or cost of transportation may from time to time require, shall not be limited or in any manner affected by the provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or by any agreement made or entered into pursuant thereto, whether general in application or special and relating only to any specific railway or railways, and the Board shall not excuse any charge of unjust discrimination, whether practised against shippers, consignees, or localities, or of undue or unreasonable preference, on the ground that such discrimination or preference is justified or required by any agreement made or entered into by the company: Provided that, notwithstanding anything in this subsection contained, rates on grain and flour shall, on and from the twenty-seventh day of June, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-five, be governed by the provisions of the agreement made pursuant to chapter five of the Statutes of Canada, 1897, but such rates shall apply to all such traffic moving from all points on all lines of railway west of Fort William to Fort William or Port Arthur over all lines now or hereafter constructed by any company subject to the jurisdiction of Parliament.\n6. The Board shall not excuse any charge of unjust discrimination, whether practised against shippers, consignees, or localities or of undue or unreasonable preference, respecting rates on grain and. flour, governed by the provisions of chapter five of the Statutes of Canada, 1897, and by the agreement made or entered into pursuant thereto within the territory in the immediately preceding subsection referred to, on the ground that such discrimination or preference is justified or required by the said Act or by the agreement made or entered into pursuant thereto.\nThe agreement referred to in subsection 5, which is to govern the rates mentioned, affected only rates in force at its date. It did not apply to tariffs of rates thereafter made payable for transport from stations not at that date in existence. Moreover, it applied only to the tariffs of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The effect of the word \u201cgovern\u201d is, I think, to require that the tariffs prescribed by the agreement are to be the basis for determining the rates for the carriage of grain and flour throughout the territory described; but subsection 6 deals with the territory as a whole (west of Fort William), and makes it clear that in the determination of rates, the provisions of the statute as to unjust discrimination and undue and unreasonable preference are to guide the Board in deciding any question as to such rates, and it is, I think, impossible to hold that the function of the Board is limited to mere arithmetical calculation. The intention is, I think, that subject to and consistently with the fundamental conditions just stated, the Board is to act conformably with the general principles controlling the constitution of tariffs of rates.\nSome questions as to the construction of these subsections need not be discussed; we need not, for example, consider whether under them the Board has authority to eliminate a rate actually fixed by the statute and agreement of 1897, upon the ground that, vis-\u00e0-vis other rates actually fixed thereby, it is unjustly discriminating. The railway companies deny this power, which the Board has held is vested in it; but the point is not material for the purposes of this appeal, and I express no opinion upon it.\nThe Board\u2019s Order (No. 448) is in these terms:\n1. That the rates on grain and flour from all points on Canadian Pacific branch lines west of Fort William to Fort William, Port Arthur and Westport be equalized to the present Canadian Pacific main line basis of rates of equivalent mileage groupings (the rates governed by the Crow\u2019s Nest Pass agreement not to be exceeded): that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company publish rates in accordance with the above direction, and that all other railway companies adjust their rates on grain and flour to Fort William, Port Arthur, Westport and Armstrong to the rates so put into effect by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, such changes to become effective on the twelfth day of September, 1927.\n2. That the rates on grain and flour from prairie points to Vancouver and Prince Rupert for export shall be on the same basis as the rates to Fort William, but in computing such rates, the distance from Calgary to Vancouver via the Canadian Pacific Railway shall be assumed to be the same as from Edmonton to Vancouver via the Canadian National Railway, namely, 766 miles.\nI do not understand that the appellant\u2014the Province of Alberta\u2014disputes the jurisdiction of the Board to pronounce this order. The province\u2019s contention is that, properly understood, the order is a valid one; but that, construed and applied as the Board has construed and applied it, it would not be competent in view of the enactments of section 325.\nMr. Woods directed the weight of his argument in support of the proposition that the tariffs in dispute are not in compliance with the order. On that topic, I expressed my views during the argument, at the close of which, I think, we were all agreed that in so far forth as the question relating to it is a question of law, it must be answered in the negative. The reasons for this conclusion are now clearly and fully expressed in the judgment of my brother Rinfret.\nBy question 2, we are asked to direct the Board upon the point, whether, in contemplation of law, the tariffs attacked could be sanctioned by the Board in exercise of its powers under Section 325. I am not sure that I have correctly penetrated the sense of the Province\u2019s contention. As I interpret it, the view advanced is that in applying the standard laid down by the Board, which is the standard for which the Province has, from the beginning, contended, mileage is the exclusive determining factor. That standard is the system of mileage group rates for the Canadian Pacific Railway\u2019s main line in force at the date of Order No. 448. In applying that standard to the Canadian National Railway, the Board is to observe the directions of the statute. The rates mentioned are to \u201cgovern\u201d the Canadian National Railway rates, subject to the rule in subsection 6, that no otherwise unjust discrimination or undue or unreasonable preference is to be permitted upon the plea that such discrimination or preference is required by the statute and agreement of 1897.\nThe language of the proviso of subsection 5 is very general. It is, of course, contemplated that it shall be worked out (under the condition prescribed by subsection 6) by the Board. And, while I agree that subsection 6 applies to the Canadian National Railway\u2014I think the language of the subsection is in that respect imperative\u2014I think we are not compelled by the general words of subsection 5 to infer an intention that the Board shall, in working out that subsection, obliterate from their minds the fact that there are two systems of railways which are, and which for the purposes of rate making have always been treated as, competitive systems. I think that is a circumstance which the Board is entitled to take into account.\nAccordingly, it seems to me that the Board did not depart from the intent of the statute in giving effect to the view that the Canadian National Railway was adjusting its rates in conformity with the statutory standard, in adopting for its datum in such cases, the rate for \u201cthe mileage grouping in effect from the nearest parallel or contiguous main or branch line station on the Canadian Pacific Railway.\u201d\nThe answer to question one is dictated by the answers to questions 2 and 3.\nQuestions 1 and 2 should be answered in the affirmative; question 3 in the negative.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nRinfret, J.\u2014The circumstances out of which the present appeal arises are the following:\nOn the 14th of October, 1924. a majority of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada held that the railway rates stipulated in the Act to authorize a Subsidy for a Railway through the Crow\u2019s Nest Pass (c. 5 of the Statutes of Canada, 60-61 Vict., 1897) and in the agreement made thereunder between the Government of Canada and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company should no longer be regarded as imposed by statute, but became subject to the control of the Board of Railway Commissioners created by the Railway Act, 1903, as a result of the wide powers conferred on the new Board for carrying out the scheme of rate control there adopted.\nUpon appeal, this Court held that the said statute and agreement were binding on the Board, which had therefore no power to change the rates thereby fixed; but that the rates so fixed applied exclusively to the designated traffic between points which were on the Canadian Pacific Railway Company\u2019s lines in 1897 (The Governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company[1]). The history of the legislation and of the judicial pronouncements leading up to the decision of this Court just referred to is fully set out in the judgment and need not be repeated here.\nSubsequent to the year 1897, the Canadian Northern Railway and the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company (now forming part of the Canadian National Railways) constructed extensive lines of railway between eastern and western Canada; and, as their lines were from time to time opened for carriage of traffic, they charged, between all competitive points, and irrespective of mileage, the same rates on grain and flour as were in force on the Canadian Pacific Railway Company\u2019s lines.\nThe Crow\u2019s Nest Pass Act and agreement, although not applying to the Canadian National Railways, of necessity had the effect of indirectly controlling their rates on all competitive lines.\nThe judgment of this Court on the Crow\u2019s Nest rates[2] was delivered on the 26th of February, 1925.\nUp to that year, the rates on grain and flour from all points which were on the Canadian Pacific Railway lines in 1897 were governed by the following section of the Act (also covenanted in the agreement):\n(e) That there shall be a reduction in the Company\u2019s present rates and tolls on grain and flour from all points on its main line, branches, or connections, west of Fort William to Fort William and Port Arthur and all points east, of three cents per one hundred pounds, to take effect in the following manner: One and one-half cent per one hundred pounds on or before the first day of September, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight, and an additional one and one-half cent per one hundred pounds on or before the first day of September, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-nine; and that no higher rates than such reduced rates or tolls shall be charged after the dates mentioned on such merchandise from the points aforesaid.\nIn 1925, section 325 of the Railway Act, 1919, was amended by adding thereto subsections 5 and 6 and was made to read as follows:\n325. The Board may disallow any tariff or any portion thereof which it considers to be unjust or unreasonable, or contrary to any of the provisions of this Act, and may require the company, within a prescribed time, to substitute a tariff satisfactory to the Board in lieu thereof, or may prescribe other tolls in lieu of the tolls so disallowed.\n2. The Board may designate the date at which any tariff shall come into force, and either on application or of its own motion may, pending investigation or for any reason, postpone the effective date of, or either before or after it comes into effect, suspend any tariff or any portion thereof. 3. Except as otherwise provided, any tariff in force, except standard tariffs hereinafter mentioned, may, subject to disallowance or change by the Board, be amended or supplemented by the company by new tariffs, in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\n4. When any tariff has been amended or supplemented, or is proposed to be amended or supplemented, the Board may order that a consolidation and reissue of such tariff be made by the company.\n5. Notwithstanding the provisions of section three of this Act the powers given to the Board under this Act to fix, determine and enforce just and reasonable rates, and to change and alter rates as changing conditions or cost of transportation may from time to time require, shall not be limited or in any manner affected by the provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or by any agreement made or entered into pursuant thereto, whether general in application or special and relating only to any specific railway or railways, and the Board shall not excuse any charge of unjust discrimination, whether practised against shippers, consignees, or localities, or of undue or unreasonable preference, on the ground that such discrimination or preference is justified or required by any agreement made or entered into by the company: Provided that, notwithstanding anything in this subsection contained, rates on grain and flour shall, on and from the twenty-seventh day of June, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-five, be governed by the provisions of the agreement made pursuant to chapter five of the Statutes of Canada 1897, but such rates shall apply to all such traffic moving from all points on all lines of railway west of Fort William to Fort William or Port Arthur over all lines now or hereafter constructed by any company subject to the jurisdiction of Parliament.\n6. The Board shall not excuse any charge of unjust discrimination, whether practised against shippers, consignees, or localities or of undue or unreasonable preference, respecting rates on grain and flour, governed by the provisions of chapter five of the Statutes of Canada 1897, and by the agreement made or entered into pursuant thereto within the territory in the immediately preceding subsection referred to, on the ground that such discrimination or preference is justified or required by the said Act or by the agreement made or entered into pursuant thereto.\nOn the 5th of June, 1925, Order in Council No. 886 was issued directing the Board to make \u2018a full and complete investigation into the rate structure of railways and railway companies subject to the jurisdiction of the Board,\nwith a view to the establishment of a fair and reasonable rate structure which will in substantially similar circumstances and conditions be equal in its application to all persons and localities, etc.\nPursuant to the directions in the order in council contained, extensive hearings took place throughout the whole of Canada. After argument, the Board gave a judgment following which General Order No. 448, dated the 26th day of August, 1927, was issued, which, inter alia, ordered as follows:\n1. That the rates on grain and flour from all points on Canadian Pacific branch lines west of Fort William to Fort William, Port Arthur and Westport be equalized to the present Canadian Pacific main line basis of rates of equivalent mileage groupings (the rates governed by the Crow\u2019s Nest Pass agreement not to be exceeded): that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company publish rates in accordance with the above direction, and that all other railway companies adjust their rates on grain and flour to Fort William, Port Arthur, Westport and Armstrong to the rates so put into effect by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, such changes to become effective on the twelfth day of September, 1927.\n2. That the rates on grain and flour from prairie points to Vancouver and Prince Rupert for export shall be on the same basis as the rates to Fort William, but in computing such rates, the distance from Calgary to Vancouver via the Canadian Pacific Railway shall be assumed to be the same as from Edmonton to Vancouver via the Canadian National Railway, namely, 766 miles.\nFor the purpose of complying with this Order (No. 448), the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Canadian National Railways published and filed new tariffs.\nThe Government of the Province of Alberta thereupon complained that the tariffs filed by the Canadian National Railways contravened General Order No. 448, in that some of the rates and tolls prescribed in those tariffs were \u201cin excess of the rates for similar mileages according to the Canadian Pacific main line basis of rates, the rates governed by the Crow\u2019s Nest Pass agreement not being exceeded.\u201d\nApplication was therefore made to the Board, praying for the disallowance of the tariffs in question as being \u201ccontrary to the terms of the said General Order and therefore contrary to law.\u201d\nIt was made clear that the application was not \u201cdirected to any Canadian Pacific Railway rates, that railway company having, in the applicant\u2019s view, put into effect the proper rates under General Order No. 448\u201d, save in two instances not material here.\nIt was further understood, it was in fact stated in the application, that there was no dispute as to the facts and that what was involved was simply a question of law.\nPrior to the application, the Board, having received a letter from Mr. Chard, the Province\u2019s Freight and Traffic Supervisor, directed its Secretary to reply that the Board had accepted the rates published in the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Canadian National Railways tariffs \u201c as complying with the provisions of General Order No. 448\u201d. The reply added:\nThe rates are published in groups as in the past and the Western boundary or extreme mileage of these groups for the Canadian Pacific Railway main line, are as follows: (Instances were then given stating the names of the railway stations, the respective mileage and rates).\nThat in the grouping of branch line rates as required by the Order, the Canadian Pacific Railway have followed the usual and proper practice of applying rates for the mileage contained in the main line groups as above. Under the proposal contained in. your letter, the mileage groups for branch lines would be greater than that for main lines.\nThat by the Order the Canadian National Railways were required to adjust their rates to those of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The Board is of the opinion that this has been done in the tariff above referred to as the Company has adopted the mileage grouping in effect from the nearest point parallel or contiguous main or branch line station on the Canadian Pacific Railway.\n* * * * *\nThat both the Canadian Pacific and Canadian National Railways have published rates to Vancouver for export in accordance with General Order No. 448.\nIn the application, reference was made to that correspondence, and the position of the Province of Alberta was condensed in the following sentence:\nThe matter rests entirely upon whether the opinion expressed by the Board as stated in the letter of the Board\u2019s Secretary of February 6, 1928, (i.e., the letter above quoted in part) is correct or erroneous as herein claimed.\nBy Order No. 45846, upon reading the said application and the statements and the correspondence therein referred to, together with the reply to the said application of the Canadian National Railways, the Board refused the application of the Province of Alberta; but, at the request of the latter, in a subsequent order, the Board granted leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada upon questions formulated as follows:\n(1) Whether as a matter of law the Canadian National Railways have any right to charge the rates in the said application complained of?\n(2) Whether as a matter of law the Board has any right to allow the Canadian National Railways to charge the rates in the application complained of?\n(3) Whether as a matter of law the rates complained of in the said application do not contravene the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of General Order No. 448, dated 26th August, 1927?\nThe first question is really subsidiary to the other two, and the answer to it must result from the answer to be given to questions Nos. 2 and 3.\nIt will be more convenient to deal first with question No. 3.\nThe answer to that question depends, of course, upon the interpretation to be put upon General Order No. 448. The appellant clearly contends \u201cthat it is not open to the Canadian National Railways under the Railway Act to charge the rates complained of with or without the consent of the Board.\u201d\nTo decide that point, consideration of the scope and effect of the amendment of 1925 to the Railway Act is necessary. By that amendment, subsection 5 of section 325 of the Railway Act, 1919, was repealed and the new subsections 5 and 6 (reproduced at the beginning of this judgment) were added. It is common ground that the amendment was adopted to meet the points determined in the judgment of this Court on the Crow\u2019s Nest Pass rates[3]. As already mentioned, one of these points was that the rates were statutory and binding on the Board of Railway Commissioners. The other point was that the rates so fixed applied only to carriage of the designated commodities between the stations which were on the Canadian Pacific Railway Company\u2019s lines in 1897; and that, against such restricted application, the anti-discrimination provisions of the Railway Act could not be invoked.\nThe enactment of 1925 begins by conferring on the Board powers of the most sweeping character\nto fix, determine and enforce just and reasonable rates, and to change and alter rates as changing conditions or cost of transportation may from time to time require,\nnotwithstanding the provisions of section 3 of the Railway Act, that is: notwithstanding the over-riding provisions of any Special Act passed by the Parliament of Canada relating to the same subject-matter. The powers are not to be\nlimited or in any manner affected by the provisions of any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or by any agreement made or entered into pursuant thereto, whether general in application or special and relating only to any specific railway or railways.\nThe Board\nshall not excuse any charge of unjust discrimination, whether practised against shippers, consignees, or localities, or of undue or unreasonable preference, on the ground that such discrimination or preference is justified or required by any agreement made or entered into by the company.\nThen comes the proviso concerning rates on grain and flour:\nProvided that, notwithstanding anything in this subsection contained, rates on grain and flour shall, on and from the date of the passing of this Act, be governed by the provisions of the agreement made pursuant to chapter five of the Statutes of Canada, 1897, but such rates shall apply to all such traffic moving from all points on all lines of railway west of Fort William to Fort William or Port Arthur over all lines now or hereafter constructed by any company subject to the jurisdiction of Parliament.\nChapter five of the Statutes of Canada, 1897, is the Crow\u2019s Nest Pass Act, and the obvious effect of the proviso is that, as to grain and flour, the rates provided for in the Crow\u2019s Nest Pass agreement are to remain in force, that they are hereafter to apply to all points west of Fort William to Fort William or Port Arthur, whether they were or were not on the Canadian Pacific Railway Company\u2019s lines in 1897, and in fact whether they are on the Canadian Pacific lines or on any other line of railway now or hereafter constructed by any company subject to the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada. By force of subsection 6, within the territory referred to, no charge of unjust discrimination or preference respecting rates on grain and flour is to be excused on the ground that it is justified or required by the Crow\u2019s Nest Pass Act or agreement.\nWe fail, however, to agree with the appellant that the effect of the proviso was to compel equalization on a mileage basis of all rates on grain and flour for all railways in the territory. If it were so, the result would be that, as a consequence of the enactment, the fixing of those rates became a mere mathematical operation to be governed exclusively by length of haulage and withdrawn, for all practical purposes, from the control of the Board. If nothing else, the removal in subsection 6 of any excuse for unjust discrimination or preference would show the contrary intention.\nBut the difficulty which stands uppermost in the way of the appellant\u2019s contention is that the Crow\u2019s Nest rates have not been built upon mileage, and such was the finding of the Board upon the facts.\nThe Crow\u2019s Nest Pass agreement did not purport to establish any basis for rates on grain and flour, nor did the Act pursuant to which the agreement was made. The Act and the agreement contain no actual unit of measurement. They provide merely for certain specified reductions to be made gradually on the rates existing in 1897.\nThe rates on grain and flour existing in 1897 were higher on certain branch lines than they were on the main line. As a result of the agreement, the stipulated reductions having been made, the difference in rates, as between main and branch lines, continued to exist in the same proportion as before; and these rates, notwithstanding they were discriminatory under the general law, were nevertheless statutory Crow\u2019s Nest rates by force of the over-riding provisions of the Special Act. This was noticed by this Court in the Crow\u2019s Nest case[4] and again by the Board in the judgment appealed from.\nThere being no uniform scale, no fixed basis (except no doubt a final fixing of certain maximum rates), whereby it should be governed and, on the other hand, having to remove all cases of unjust discrimination, the Board, in its judgment, decided to equalize all Canadian Pacific Railway rates on the basis of the main line rates. This meant that the higher branch line rates were to come down to the level of the main line rates. The Board further directed that in no case should the rates governed by the Crow\u2019s Nest Pass agreement be exceeded.\nHaving thus provided for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company\u2019s rates, the judgment a quo ordered that other railways in the territory should so adjust their grain and flour rates as to meet the rates adopted for the Canadian Pacific Railway. In so doing, the Board interpreted the statute to mean that in applying the Crow\u2019s Nest rates to other railways, the standard to be reckoned with was not of a per mileage basis, since such a basis never existed,\u2014but the intention of Parliament, as expressed in the enactment, was, in the given territory, to establish a relationship between the rates on the Canadian Pacific Railway governed by the Crow\u2019s Nest Pass Act and agreement and the rates on the other railways, which would put on an equal footing all persons and localities situated under substantially similar circumstances. That view is further supported by the removal of all limitation to the application of the discriminatory provisions of the Railway Act. It is consistent with the spirit of those provisions, as well as with the usual and proper railway practice, that in attempting to secure a fair and reasonable rate structure, account should be taken of the equivalent or competitive points as between the several railways.\nIn our opinion, the view taken by the Board is in conformity with the enactment of 1925. A further consideration, suggested by counsel for the respondent, and not without considerable weight, is that, if effect were given to the contentions of the appellant, it would mean that in many instances the rates from Canadian National points in competitive territory would be reduced below the level of rates from competing stations of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The result would be that, in order to retain the business from such competitive points, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company would be compelled to lower its rates further, a result not contemplated by the existing legislation.\nIn carrying out General Order No. 448, the Canadian National Railways, in the tariffs complained of, adopted the mileage grouping in effect from the nearest point, parallel or contiguous, main or branch line station, on the Canadian Pacific Railway. This was considered by the Board not to be contrary to the Order and the Board refused to disallow it. It cannot be said, as a matter of law, that the Board had no right to allow the Canadian National Railways to charge the rates thus approved; and we answer the second question in the affirmative.\nAs to rates from points west of Fort William to Vancouver and Prince Rupert, we do not interpret the questions submitted as intending to cover them. Those rates do not come within the proviso of the Statute of 1925. Any objection to them must be based on grounds of unjust discrimination or preference, the determination of which are eminently within the Board\u2019s province.\nOur conclusion is that the Board of Railway Commissioners of Canada was competent to issue General Order No. 448 and that the tariffs filed thereunder did not contravene the Order.\nThe questions submitted should be answered as follows:\n(1) Whether as a matter of law the Canadian National Railways have any right to charge the rates in the said application complained of? YES;\n(2) Whether as a matter of law the Board has any right to allow the Canadian National Railways to charge the rates in the application complained of? YES; (3) Whether as a matter of law the rates complained of in the said application do not contravene the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of General Order No. 448, dated 26th August, 1927? NO;\nand the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nQuestions answered as above, and appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Woods, Field, Craig & Hyndman.\nSolicitor for the respondent, Canadian National Railways: Alistair Fraser.\nSolicitor for the respondent, Canadian Pacific Railway Company: E.

Fletcher\u2014Expert evidence\u2014Charge to jury\u2014Jury's findings.\nPlaintiff, as a councilor of defendant village, acting under authority of a village by-law, took charge of operation of its chemical fire ex\u00adtinguisher at a fire, turned the crank which broke the sulphuric acid bottle (to generate pressure) and was severely injured by an explosion, which occurred because 'the bolt holding in place the covering of the sulphuric acid chamber was not screwed down. The extinguisher had been kept in a pool room. The village council had appointed the vil\u00adlage constable as \" fire chief,\" and required him to keep the extin\u00adguisher \"in proper working shape.\" Plaintiff sued the village for damages. The jury found that plaintiff's injury was caused by de\u00adfendant's negligence in \"not having their fire extinguisher properly inspected and kept in perfect working order \"; that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence \"only to the fact that he was a councillor on the date of the fire, but not negligent in the operation of the fire extinguisher at the time of the fire\" The Court of Appeal\n*PRESENT :Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ. for Saskatchewan (25 Sask. L.R. 65), reversing judgment of Taylor J. (24 Sask. L.R. 198), gave judgment to plaintiff for damages. Defendant appealed.\nHeld (Duff and Newcombe JJ. dissenting) that the appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ.: It was for the jury, on all the evi\u00addence, to say whether the proper inference to be drawn was that the acid 'chamber covering was loose because the fire chief had failed to tighten the bolt when he had last recharged the extinguisher or to inspect it properly afterwards, or that some third person had unscrewed the bolt (as to interference by a third person, the onus was on defendant to establish it, or at least to shew such probability that the jury would infer it: Dominion Natural Gas Co. v. Collins, [1909] A.C. 640). Also 'the question of plaintiff's negligence was one of fact for the jury; it was for them to say whether or not, in his operation of the extinguisher, he had failed to exercise the care which a reasonably prudent and careful man would have exercised in like circumstances. Unless plaintiff had season to suspect that the fire chief had not done his duty as to inspection, the jury was entitled to find plaintiff not guilty of negligence in assuming that he had. There was evi\u00addence from which the jury might find that plaintiff's injuries were caused by negligence of defendant, and also that plaintiff's conduct in operation of the extinguisher was free from want of care. The maxim volenti non fit injuria did not apply; plaintiff, who was unaware that the covering was not properly fastened, neither appreciated the danger he was running nor voluntarily incurred 'the risk (C.P.R. v. Fr\u00e9chette, [19151 A.C. 871, at 880, cited). The first part of the jury's finding as to contributory negligence, viewed in the light of the circumstances and the judge's charge, meant that the only negligence of which they found plaintiff guilty was that he shared with his fellow councillors in their representative capacity in not seeing to it that the extin\u00adguisher was duly inspected and kept fit for immediate use. As to this, it has long been established law 'that a person is not liable in his individual capacity for a tort committed in his corporate capacity (Mill v. Hawker, L.R. 9 Ex. 309, at 321, and other cases cited). The objections by defendant to the judge's charge to 'the jury were not maintainable. Taken as a whole, it did not direct that there was an absolute duty on defendant to keep its extinguisher from doing harm (Doctrine of Rylands v. Fletcher, L.R. 3 H.L. 330, discussed, and held not to apply, the extinguisher having been brought to the village for . common protection of the 'corporation and its citizens as individuals; Rickards v. Lothian, [1913] A.C. 263, at 280; Hess v. Greenway, 48 D.L.R. 630, cited), but impressed upon them that the only basis on which defendant could be charged with liability was negligence; his direction that the care to be observed by defendant must be com\u00admensurate with the danger of harm involved, was a proper one. His direction to disregard the evidence of one F., an inspector for the fire commissioner of the province, to the effect that one operating the extinguisher should see that the covering was tight before breaking the acid bottle, was unobjectionable, as the elements did not exist to justify its 'admission as expert evidence, and the jury were as capable as the witness of forming a correct judgment as to plaintiff's acts. Per Duff and Newcombe JJ. (dissenting) : The risk of escape of the liquid to the injury of persons in proximity was one which it was the abso\u00adlute duty, in point of law, of any person working the machine, to avoid, if reasonably possible. Plaintiff knew of the danger if the covering were not tight, and to ascertain and correct the condition was a simple and quick operation. It was the duty of the munici\u00adpality, at the time of actual operation, not to release the acid without first seeing that the covering was securely fastened. The acts of plaintiff in is operation of the machine were the acts of the munici\u00adpality, and its said duty was equally his duty; he owed a duty to it to see that the responsibility resting upon it, in respect of the precautions to be observed in working the machine, were, so far as reasonably possible, discharged. He was not entitled to assume that, because of instructions given to the \"fire chief,\" the covering was tight, in view of the facts (known to plaintiff) that the machine had been exposed in a place open to the public, that it could be made unsafe very easily, that, by reason of the fire chief's other duties, a periodical inspection was the utmost that could be expected, and in view of possibility of neglect by the fire chief, the simple nature of the precaution required at the moment of operation, and the magni\u00adtude of the danger. The direct and proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries was his own neglect. Further, there were errors in the charge to the jury, as to the extent of defendant's duty, and in withdraw\u00ading from the jury F.'s evidence as to the proper, known and recog\u00adnized method of working the machine; which errors in the charge, were the action not to be dismissed, would be ground for a new trial.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1].\nThe action was for damages for personal injuries sus\u00adtained by the plaintiff through the explosion of one of the defendant's chemical fire extinguishers, the operation of which extinguisher the plaintiff (who was a member of the council of the defendant village) had taken charge of at a fire, the cause of the accident being, so plaintiff alleged, the defendant's negligence. The trial judge, Taylor J., on certain findings of the jury and his construction thereof and his view of the law bearing on the matters involved, dismissed the action[2]. The plaintiff appealed, and the defendant cross-appealed (against certain findings of the jury as perverse and on other contentions). The Court of Appeal1 allowed the plaintiff's appeal and dismissed the defendant's cross-appeal, set aside the judgment below and directed that judgment be entered for the plaintiff for the amount awarded by the jury ($1,250.26 for special damages, and $5,200 for general damages; no appeal was taken as to the amount assessed). The material facts of the case, the findings of the jury, and the issues in question, are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported.\nThe appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs, Duff and Newcombe JJ. dissenting.\nP. H. Gordon, K.C., for the appellant.\nP. M. Anderson, K.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ.) was delivered by\nLAMONT, J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan[3] in favour of the plaintiff in an action for damages for personal injuries sustained by him through the explosion of one of the defendant's chemical fire extinguishers at a fire which occurred in the Village of Kelliher on the evening of December 22, 1927. The defendant's extinguisher consists of a forty gallon cylindrical tank on wheels to which a hose is attached. Attached to it also is a framework whereby the machine can be pushed or pulled as required. Towards the rear end but inset in the top of the tank in a separate chamber is a glass bottle of sulphuric acid hold\u00ading about three pints. This chamber is covered with an iron dome covering, convex in shape. Over this dome is an iron circular band which is bolted to the tank. Through the centre of this band is an iron screw bolt which when screwed down tight holds the iron dome firmly in its place so that no gas or liquid can come out of the top of the sulphuric acid chamber. The tank is filled with a solution of water and bicarbonate of soda. To put the extinguisher in operation at a fire the sulphuric acid bottle has to be broken. This is done by turning a crank on the outside of the tank which causes a hammer ,on the inside to strike it. The acid then mingles with the solution in the tank and generates a high pressure of carbonic acid gas which forces the mixture through the nozzle of the hose upon the fire and smothers it. The extinguisher was kept in the village pool room because it was a central place and was always warm in winter. About eight o'clock on the evening of December 22, 1927, an alarm of fire was given in Kelliher, and the plaintiff, who was 'a general merchant and also a member of the village council, ran to the pool room and, with a Mr. Wilson, got one of the two extinguishers owned by the defendant and pulled it to the fire. Having got it in place, the plaintiff turned the crank and broke the sulphuric acid bottle to generate pressure. In a few seconds the dome covering of the sulphuric acid chamber blew off and a stream of sulphuric acid struck the plaintiff in the face, burning him severely and practically destroying his eyesight. The dome blew off because the iron bolt for holding it in place had not been screwed down. This was shewn by the fact that the threads on the bolt had not been injured. It was the duty of the fire chief, H. G. Clark, to keep the extinguishers in good working order.\nAt the trial the plaintiff's contention was that his injuries were caused by the failure of the defendant to maintain the extinguisher in a safe and proper condition for use; while the defendant contended that the explosion was due to the plaintiff's want of care, (a) in attempting to operate the extinguisher without first seeing that the bolt which held the dome cover in place had been screwed down tight, and (b) in that he and his fellow councillors had not kept the extinguisher in proper condition for use. The defendant also set up that the plaintiff was well aware of the danger, and voluntarily accepted the risk. The material questions, and the answers of the jury thereto, are as follows:\u2014\nQ. 1. Was the injury to the plaintiff on the 22nd December, 1927, caused by the negligence of the defendants?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. 2. If so, in what did such negligence consist? Give particulars.\u2014A. For not having 'heir fire extinguisher properly inspected and kept in perfect working order.\nQ. 3. Do you find the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. 4. If so, in what did such contributory negligence consist? Give particulars.\u2014A. Only to the fact that he was a councillor on the date of the fire but not negligent in the operation of the fire extinguisher at the time of the fire.\nOn these findings the trial judge dismissed the action[4].\nThe plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal and the\ndefendant served notice of cross appeal stating that on the\nhearing it would contend that there was no evidence upon which a jury could reasonably find that the defendant was guilty of negligence, nor could they reasonably absolve the plaintiff from contributory negligence in his operation of the extinguisher ,at the fire, and that their answers on both points were perverse. The notice further stated that the defendant would contend that the maxim volenti non fit injuria should be applied in this case. The Court of Appeal allowed the plaintiff's appeal and dismissed the cross appeal[5]. From that judgment this appeal is brought.\nBefore us counsel for the defendant again advanced the argument that the answers of the jury to Question 2, and the latter part of their answer to Question 4, were perverse and contrary to the evidence; and he stressed the fact that the extinguisher was kept in a place open to the public, any one of whom might have unscrewed the bolt which holds in place the iron dome.\nThe jury had before them the fact that the defendant had brought to the village as a fire fighting apparatus this chemical extinguisher which was a highly dangerous instru\u00admentality unless care was taken to keep the dome covering of the sulphuric acid chamber tightly fastened. They knew that the extinguishers were kept in the pool room and that the defendant intended and expected its citizens, on hearing an alarm ,of fire, to go to the pool room and get the extinguishers and take them to the fire where they were to be used in fighting the flames. To be effective for that purpose the extinguishers were required to be in a condi\u00adtion in which they could be immediately and safely oper\u00adated. In his charge the trial judge instructed the jury that if the municipality keeps a machine which is dangerous, or potentially dangerous, it assumes the responsibility of keep\u00ading it from doing harm; that if the machine is kept to be used at fires and there is an extra danger in its use, then there is upon the municipality so providing it a duty to take precautions to avoid that danger and that the duty was commensurate with the danger involved. The council recognized its obligation in this respect and had notified the fire chief that it was his duty to \" keep the extinguishers in proper working shape \". The jury had also before them the fact that, in August, the fire chief had recharged the extinguishers, which necessitated taking the dome covering off the sulphuric acid chamber, and that neither extin\u00adguisher had thereafter been used until the fire in question. The fire chief in his evidence stated that he knew the bolt had been screwed down after the extinguisher had been recharged or he would not have left it. This the jury may have thought was reasoning rather than recollection, at any rate it was for them to say whether or not they would accept the evidence. They had also before them conclusive evi\u00addence that when the other extinguisher was taken to the fire the wheel that opens the valve which permits the mixture to flow through the hose was stuck fast and could not be turned. This fact alone was evidence that there had been no proper inspection of the extinguishers and entitled the jury, if they thought fit, to reject the evidence of the fire chief and the overseer that they had inspected the extinguishers a few days before the fire and that everything was in good order. There was also the fact that, although for years the extinguishers had been kept in the pool room, no one had ever improperly interfered with them. It was for the jury, .on all the evidence, to say whether the proper inference to be drawn was that the dome covering was loose because the fire chief had failed to tighten the bolt when he recharged the tank or to properly inspect the extinguishers afterwards, or that some third person had unscrewed the bolt, which is the only other explanation suggested. As to interference by a third person, the onus was on the defendant to establish it or at least to shew such a probability of its having taken place that the jury would infer that it had. Dominion Natural Gas Co v. Collins[6].\nOn the question of the plaintiff's contributory negligence, the jury had before them an account of the 'acts of the plaintiff shewing just what he did and how he did it. They had also his testimony that he saw nothing to indicate that the dome covering was loose or to direct his attention to it, and that he assumed the fire chief had obeyed the council's instructions and kept the extinguishers in proper working order. With all these facts before them it was the duty of the jury to say whether or not, in his operation of the extinguisher, the plaintiff had failed to exercise the care which a reasonably prudent and careful man would have exercised in like circumstances. For the defendant it was pointed out that there was in force a village by-law which enacted that \"the overseer of the village, or in his absence any member of the council, whom failing, the fire inspector, shall be the director of operations at \" a fire, and it was urged that this imposed upon the plaintiff the duty of making sure that the extin\u00adguisher was in a condition in which it could be used with safety before putting it in operation. The by-law does not in terms require a councillor directing operations at a fire to make an inspection of the extinguisher before putting it in operation. That was the duty of the fire chief, and unless the plaintiff had some reason to suspect that the fire chief had not done his duty the jury were entitled to find that he was not guilty of negligence in assuming that he had. Furthermore, it must not be forgotten that in taking charge of the extinguisher at the fire the plaintiff was fulfilling an obligation imposed upon him in his official capacity by the by-law. In the absence, therefore, of a statutory provision making a councillor individually re\u00adsponsible for the failure of the fire chief to obey his instructions, which the by-law does not do, or casting on a councillor the duty of personal inspection of the extin\u00adguishers, the whole question of the plaintiff's negligence was a question of fact for the jury. I, therefore, agree with the Court of Appeal that there was evidence from which the jury might find, not only that the plaintiff's injuries were caused by the negligence of the defendant, but that the conduct of the plaintiff in his operation of the extinguisher at the fire was free from any want of care on his part.\nThe argument of the defendant's counsel that this was a proper case for the application of the maxim volenti non fit injuria, cannot be supported. In C.P.R. v. Fr\u00e9chette[7], the Privy Council held that to establish this defence it must be shewn, (1) that the plaintiff clearly knew and appre\u00adciated the nature and character of the risk he ran, and (2) that he voluntarily incurred it. In the present case the plaintiff was not aware that the dome covering was not properly fastened and, therefore, he neither appreciated the danger he was running nor voluntarily incurred the risk.\nAs far as the matters before the Court of Appeal are concerned there is only one question which, in my opinion, requires consideration, and that is: what did the jury mean by their finding that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence \" only to the fact that he was a councillor on the date of the fire \"? Their express finding that he was \"not negligent in the operation of the fire extinguisher at the time of the fire \" shews that the negligence of which they found him guilty as a councillor did not include any want of care on his part in his operation of the extinguisher from the moment it reached the scene of the fire. From that moment he is absolved from any charge of contributory negligence. With negligence on the part of the plaintiff in the operation of the extinguisher excluded, the answer of the jury is, to my mind, intelligible, and their meaning reasonably clear viewed in the light of the circumstances and the instructions given to them. By their answers to the first two questions they had found the defendant guilty of negligence causing the plaintiff's injuries. The defendant could only act through its council. The negligence of the defendant was, therefore, the negligence of its council. In his charge the trial judge said:\u2014\nSome things are more dangerous than other things and if it is highly dangerous, very dangerous, the law imposes on the municipality the duty to protect against that danger. They cannot escape the duty that is put upon them by simply delegating it to someone else. It is insufficient to pass a resolution requiring someone or some persons to inspect the ma\u00adchinery and let it go at that.\nThis the jury would understand referred to the direction of the council to the fire chief to keep the extinguishers in good working order which the fire chief admitted involved the duty of an inspection. By reason of this direction the jury knew that the defendant village could not escape liability on the ground that the council directed the fire chief to perform a duty which the law cast upon the council itself. What the jury meant, therefore, by their answer, in my opinion, was that the only negligence of which they found the plaintiff guilty was that which he shared with his fellow councillors in their representative capacity in not seeing to it that the extinguishers were duly inspected and kept fit for immediate use. At first sight it might seem that the jury by finding the plaintiff guilty of negligence as a councillor \" on the date of the fire,\" had in mind some specific dereliction of duty by him as councillor on that date. I do not think, however, that the words mean, or were intended to mean, anything more than that the plaintiff was, on the day of the fire, a councillor and, as such, he had failed to see that the duty resting on the council had been performed. That this was the jury's meaning seems established by the fact that, once negligence in the opera\u00adtion of the extinguisher was eliminated, there was no negli\u00adgence of which the plaintiff, under the circumstances, could be guilty except a breach of duty in his representative capacity, and it has long been established law that a person is not liable in his individual capacity for a tort com\u00admitted in his corporate capacity.\nIn Mill v. Hawker[8], Kelly, C.B., said:\u2014\nI conceive it to be settled law that no action lies against the indi\u00advidual members of a corporation for a corporate act done by the cor\u00adporation in its corporate capacity, unless the act be maliciously done by the individuals charged, and the corporate name be used as a mere colour for the malicious act, or unless the act is ultra vires, and is not, and cannot be in contemplation of law, a corporate act at all.\nSee also Mahoney v. Guelph[9] ; Harman v. Tappen\u00adden[10].\nThe only other contention made was that there should be a new trial, because the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury in three material particulars:\u2014\n(a) that he instructed them that the law imposed upon the defendant the duty of keeping and maintaining at all times the fire extinguisher in a safe and proper condition at their peril;\n(b) that he failed to instruct them as to the degree of care to be exercised by the plaintiff in handling the extinguisher; and\n(c) that he directed them to disregard the evidence of Johnson and Furby as to the way of operating the extinguisher.\nThese objections had been taken at the trial although a new trial was not asked for in the court below.\nThe portion of the charge objected to under (a) reads:\u2014\nPersons having highly dangerous articles assume the responsibility of keeping them safe. It was the duty of the defendants to maintain the same, to maintain the fire extinguisher, \"in a safe and proper condition for use and operation as required.\" As it is put in one case \" they are bound to keep it secure at their peril.\"\nIt was contended that, by the use of the words \" at their peril \", the trial, judge instructed the jury that there was an absolute duty resting upon the defendant to keep its extinguisher from causing harm, and that the law did not impose such an onerous duty but only imposed the duty of using a reasonable, or at most, a high degree of care. I do not think the doctrine of Rylands v. Fletcher[11] has any application to a case like the present. That rule provides that any person who, for his own purposes, brings on his land or keeps or collects there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes, keeps it at his peril. If it escapes and does harm to others, the owner is responsible independently of the existence of either wrongful intent or negligence on his part. The rule, however, only applies where the dan\u00adgerous agency is kept by the defendant for his own purposes. It, therefore, has no application where, as here, the extin\u00adguisher was brought to the village for the common pro\u00adtection of the corporation and its citizens as individuals. Rickards v. Lothian[12]; Hess v. Greenway[13]. Although the trial judge, in instructing the jury as to the degree of care required from the defendant, did use a phrase which, if it stood alone, might be understood as imposing liability without any negligence on the defendant's part, a perusal of his charge makes it very clear that he impressed upon the jury that the only basis upon which the defendant could be charged with liability was negligence on its part\u2014that is that the defendant village through its council had failed to observe that degree of care which a careful and prudent man would have observed under the circumstances. He told the jury that the care which it was the defendant's duty to observe must be commensurate with the danger of harm involved. This, in my opinion, was a proper direc\u00adtion. It may be that the use of a particular instrumental\u00adity might be attended with such extraordinary risk that the only care commensurate with the danger would be such care as operates to prevent injury. In my opinion this objection cannot be maintained.\nThe portion of the charge referred to in (b) reads:\u2014\nWhen it comes o the standard of duty to be observed by the plaintiff to guide you in determining whether he has been guilty of contribu\u00adtory negligence or not it is not so easy to put it into words. He was bound to use such care as a reasonable and prudent man in like circumstances would use, such care as a reasonable and prudent man in the cir\u00adcumstances would observe. You are the judges of that standard.\nTo this Mr. Gordon, counsel for the defendant, states his objection in the following language:\u2014\nI think your lordship should have informed them what a reasonable and prudent man would have done with full knowledge of the danger that he was encountering in breaking the bottle.\nAs the plaintiff was unaware of the special danger he was encountering through the dome covering not being fastened, I do not see that the trial judge could have been more explicit on this point than he was without invading the province of the jury. In Sherman & Redfield on the Law of Negligence, 6th ed., par. 53, page 105, the learned author says:\u2014\nThere are no abstract rules, defining so clearly the duties `of men, under all circumstances, that the court can state them without passing upon any question .of fact. The extent of the defendant's duty is to be determined by a consideration of all the surrounding circumstances. The law imposes duties upon men, according to the circumstances in which they are called to act. And though the law defines the duty, the question, whether the circumstances exist which impose that duty upon a par\u00adticular person, is one of fact. In very many cases the law gives no better definition of negligence than the want of such care as men of ordin\u00adary prudence or good men of business would use under similar circum\u00adstances. Of course, this raises a question of fact as to what men of this character usually do under the same circumstances. This is a point upon which a jury have a right to pass, even though no evidence of the usage were given; for they may properly determine the question by referring o their own experience and observation. Indeed, they must do so; since expert evidence on such points is usually not admissible.\nThe instruction to disregard the testimony of Johnson and Furby, complained of under (c), had reference to the opinion each expressed that, in operating an extinguisher such as the defendant had, it was the duty of the operator to ascertain if the dome covering was properly fastened before breaking the bottle of sulphuric acid. Johnson was the village blacksmith, and Furby was an inspector for the fire commissioner for the province, whose duty it was to go to the various cities, towns and villages to see if the fire equipment of each was in order. In effect what these witnesses were being asked was whether or not the plaintiff, in operating the extinguisher the way he did, had been guilty of negligence which contributed to his injuries. This was surely the province of the jury. It was contended that the testimony was admissible because the witnesses were experts. In Beven on Negligence, 4th ed., at page 141, the author says:\u2014 To justify the admission of expert testimony two elements must coexist:\n(1) The subject-matter of the inquiry must be such that ordinary people are unlikely to form a correct judgment about it, if unassisted by persons with special knowledge.\n(2) The witness offering expert evidence must have gained his special knowledge by a course of study or previous habit which secures his habitual familiarity with the matter in hand.\nIn my opinion, the jury were just as capable as the witnesses of forming a correct judgment as to the plaintiff's acts, and the evidence does not disclose that either of the witnesses had ever operated a similar fire extinguisher. The object of expert evidence is to explain the effect of facts of which otherwise no coherent rendering can be given. Carter v. Boehm[14].\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Duff and Newcombe JJ., dissenting, was delivered by\nDUFF, J.\u2014This is one of those cases in which the plaintiff's sufferings evoke naturally the compassion and sympathy of everybody, and I add, without the least hesi\u00adtation, having considered the circumstances fully in every one of their aspects, in my own mind, a feeling of profound regret that the village community, represented by the appellant municipality, should have thought it right that his claim for compensation should be considered and determined on strictly legal principles. The duty of this court, however, is a rigorous one; here, the claim must be investigated and decided dispassionately, as matter of legal right.\nThe respondent was severely injured, having (inter alia) his sight gravely impaired, through the escape from a \" chemical\" fire extinguisher of liquid under high pres\u00adsure heavily charged with sulphuric acid.\nFor the sake of clearness, it is convenient here to describe the fire extinguisher. The extinguisher, which is of a design in common use, consists of a cylindrical tank carried on a frame between two wheels about three feet high. At one end there is a handle used to pull or push it when required. At the same end is a leg or prop to hold the tank in a horizontal position. At the top of the tank and at the end nearest the handle is an opening through which the extinguisher is charged. The tank is first filled with a solution of water and bicarbonate of soda. Inside the opening is a cage in which is placed a bottle of sulphuric acid. Over the opening there is a metal dome held firmly in position by a screw-bolt which is screwed into the open\u00ading. A lever passes through the top of the screw-bolt, by which it can be tightened or loosened readily by hand. As to this end of the tank, set in the centre of it, there is a handle that, when pulled, throws up a hammer which breaks the bottle containing the sulphuric acid, which then becomes mixed with the solution of bicarbonate of soda. Carbonic acid gas is developed and the pressure of the gas forces the solution through a hose connected with the tank. There is also a pressure gauge and valve which must be opened to enable the liquid to escape. The pressure indi\u00adcated on the valve is as high as 200 pounds.\nThe respondent was one of the village councillors, and, a fire having broken out in the village, he was (in execution of his duty as he conceived it) in charge of the extinguisher at the scene of the fire, when he was injured.\nThe respondent says that he pulled the handle attached to the hammer, breaking the bottle of sulphuric acid, and called upon a bystander to open the valve connected with the hose, which he says was done, when the metal dome was forced from its place and a jet of liquid emerged which struck him in the face. There was no dispute that the dome could not have been firmly screwed into its place or that the escape of the liquid was due to this.\nHis claim against the appellants was based upon a charge of negligence. The duty, stated in general terms, in which he alleged the municipality had failed, is accurately defined in the finding of the jury, as a duty to have \" their fire extinguisher properly inspected and kept in perfect work\u00ading order \". The particular matter in which the munici\u00adpality is alleged to have made default (the matter intended to be designated by the finding of the jury) was the failure at all times \" to keep the cap closed \"\u2014to quote the words of the trial judge. The jury found in favour of the respondent, and an appeal to the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan was dismissed[15]. Before proceeding to comment upon the legal conten\u00adtions, it is essential to make plain the actual position of the respondent and to outline the steps taken by the municipality for the care of the two fire extinguishers which it possessed. The village had statutory authority to \"make provision for protection against fire \"\u2014I am quoting the summary of the legislation given by the trial judge in his charge. Acting in part, no doubt, under that authority, the council had passed a by-law containing this clause:\u2014\n43. The Overseer of the Village, or in his absence any member of the council, whom failing, the fire inspector, shall be the director of opera\u00adtions at, and regulate the conduct of all persons assisting in the suppres\u00adsion or extinguishment of fires, and he may call upon any person present at any fire to render every assistance in his power to suppress and ex\u00adtinguish the same.\nThe learned trial judge instructed the jury that the council had exceeded its powers in professing to make it obligatory upon councillors to perform the duties prescribed in section 43. As to that, I express no opinion, and it may be that the direction has no bearing upon this appeal. At all events, in the view I take upon other aspects of the case, the point is unimportant. The by-law does clear\u00adly authorize the councillors, in the contingency defined, to take charge (to direct operations and to regulate the conduct of persons assisting) ; and to that extent it is clearly intra vires. The respondent in what he did acted upon the authority embodied in the by-law. That is left beyond doubt by his own evidence.\nQ. When you four men were over there was there any one taking charge of this?\u2014A. I did.\nQ. Why did you?\u2014A. I was the only councillor present.\nQ. What authority as councillor did you have to do this?\u2014A. Well, I have authority from the by-law.\nQ. What by-law?\u2014A. By-law No. 34, Fire by-law.\nMr. ANDERSON : I would like to put that by-Iaw in as an exhibit.\nHis LORDSHIP: I would like to know if he was familiar with that by-law.\nMr. ANDERSON: Were you familiar with that by-law?\u2014A. I was. His LORDSHIP: How and when? It may be most material. How and when?\nQ. Were you familiar with that by-law before the time of this acci\u00addent?\u2014A. Yes, I was.\nQ. Do you remember what year it was passed in?\u2014A. 1926.\nQ. How did you familiarize yourself with it?\u2014A. Well, I was on the council. When I went into the council it was the natural thing o go into the by-laws and read them up.\nQ. And you did familiarize yourself with by-law No. 34?\u2014A. Yes. The municipality had no proper place of its own where the extinguishers could be stored; and they were kept in a pool room, where, it is admitted, they were accessible to the public. There was a great deal of discussion at the trial as to the duties of one Clarke, who is generally referred to as the fire chief. In point of fact, Clarke was, and had been for years, the village constable charged with the duties incident to that office, as well as the duties of caretaker of the rink, receiving a wage of $30 a month. In 1927, he complained to the council that he had not access to a number of hand extinguishers which were left in the cus\u00adtody of individuals in their houses, and asked for authority to inspect them. A by-law was passed appointing him Fire Chief and he was then instructed by the village overseer and the plaintiff, to quote the plaintiff's evidence, \" to look after these fire extinguishers and see they were kept in proper working order and kept in some safe place \". No additional wage was attached to the new office, and admittedly there was no intention to change the place of storage of the fire extinguishers with which we are con\u00adcerned. It was the duty of Clarke, from time to time, to recharge the extinguishers; and they had been recharged on some day in the late summer or early fall.\nThe learned trial judge held, and so instructed the jury, that the appellants were under a legal obligation \" to maintain this extinguisher in a safe and proper condition for use and operation as required.\" They were bound, he said, \" to keep it secure at their peril.\" This obligation includ\u00aded, he held, the specific legal duty \" to keep the cap closed.\" In the Court of Appeal, the duty of the appellants, by Mac\u00adkenzie J.A., is described in the terms of the jury's finding to have the extinguishers \" kept in perfect working order.\" This view he grounds apparently upon \" the emergency conditions under which such apparatus must often neces\u00adsarily be used\" * * *\nThere can be no question as o how the accident happened, in that the metal cap covering the chamber was loose and so permitted the expulsion of the acid upon its release from the chamber. It is denied that it became loose when the extinguisher was taken to the fire. It must therefore have become loose while it was being kept in the poolroom. The council, however, had appointed Clarks as fire chief for the very purpose of keeping it in proper working order. Therefore Clarke must have been derelict in his duty and so have rendered the defendant liable. Turgeon J.A. puts the case in a rather different way. He says:\nThe defendant corporation, in order o secure its own property and the property of its citizens against the spread of fire, purchased this ex\u00adtinguisher and kept it, ready for use, in a place accessible o the public ; and it was intended and desired that the public, in case of fire, should take the extinguisher, convey it o the place required, and operate it. Admit\u00adtedly, the extinguisher contains a dangerous substance, sulphuric acid, and is sure, or almost sure, to cause a serious accident, when operated, unless it is in perfect condition; that is, unless (for the purposes of this case) the metal cap above referred to is firmly bolted down.\n* * * * *\nIn these circumstances, and assuming that the jury accepted this evi\u00addence, which they had the right o do, I think that the least that can be said concerning the defendants' liability is that they were under obli\u00adgation to take all reasonable precautions to keep this machine in safe condition, having regard to the dangerous nature of its contents and to the fact that, when wanted, it would be wanted in a hurry and that the call for its use might come at any moment of the day or night, and con\u00adsidering also that it was lodged in a place accessible in daytime to many people, uncovered, and unprotected in any manner from the curious and the meddlesome, and that it might be made unsafe very easily, by a simple turn of the wrench.\nIn view of the course of the trial, and the expressions of opinion just quoted, it is important to recall that on this appeal we are only concerned with negligence causing the injury to the respondent, negligence, to quote the phrase of Lord Cairns, dans locum injuriae; and that the appel\u00adlants can be held responsible to the respondent, in law, only for breach of some duty owing to him which they have violated, and the violation of which was the direct cause of the harm of which he complains. We are not now to consider the rules or principles which might come into play, if somebody, with no express authority from the ap\u00adpellants, had taken possession of this machine and in ignor\u00adance of the working of it had, through his ignorance or unskilfulness, been the cause of an injury to a bystander. In such a case, we should have to investigate the question of the responsibility of the appellants for the acts of the person working the machine. There is evidence in the by-law before us, that such a procedure was not contemplated by the municipality; and whether the municipality did order its affairs in such a way as to preclude it from disputing re\u00adsponsibility in such circumstances, is a question which might involve debatable issues of law and fact. Had the unskilled person who had assumed the responsibility, in his ignorance, of working the machine, been himself in\u00adjured, a further question, still, might arise. These points are not now before us.\nThe respondent, throughout the occurrences, was acting, as he says, under the authority vested in him as councillor. The machine when under his control was under the con\u00adtrol of the municipality, his acts were the acts of the municipality\u2014in taking the machine to the scene of the fire, in releasing the sulphuric acid, and setting up the pres\u00adsure which was the immediate agency in expelling the liquid that so grievously disfigured him. This last men\u00adtioned act was the decisive, the effective act, and, to repeat, it was the act of the municipality, as well as that of the respondent.\nNow, as regards third parties, the responsibility of the municipality for the consequences of this act is indisput\u00adable. A great deal is said, in the charge and in the judg\u00adments, about the importance of keeping the metal cap always securely fastened in preparation for any sudden emergency requiring the employment of the extinguisher. But whatever may be said about that, it is self-evident that the necessity of that precaution could never be so pal\u00adpable as at the very moment when the machine is to be put into operation. There can be no room for argument upon the point that at that moment, it was the duty of the municipality to see that the dome was securely fastened.\nOne must visualize the situation in the concrete. Sev\u00aderal persons were in close proximity to the machine. All these were exposed to the danger of the gravest injury if the solution in the tank, instead of being forced through the hose, were expelled through the aperture intended to be sealed up by the metal dome. The risk of the escape of this liquid was a risk, which it was the absolute duty, in point of law, of any person working the machine, to avoid, if reasonably possible. Moreover, in point of fact, there was no necessity, no sort of excuse, even, for incurring such a risk. We have not here the case of a pressing emer\u00adgency, in which some desirable precaution could only be observed at the cost of dangerous or even inconvenient delay or of serious loss of efficiency. To ascertain whether the tank was securely closed, and if not, to screw in the cover, and make the machine absolutely safe, was the work of an instant only, and of course an operation of the very simplest character. It was therefore, plainly, the duty of the municipality not to incur the wholly needless and useless risk of the liquid escaping, by releasing the sulphuric acid without first seeing that the covering was securely fastened.\nThis was equally the duty of the respondent. He was engaged personally in working the machine. He was cogni\u00adzant of all the facts. He says he knew and appreciated the character of the risk.\nQ. You knew exactly how these things functioned at the time of the\naccident?\u2014A. I did.\n* * * * *\nQ. You knew you had o direct operations?\u2014A. I did.\n* * * * *\nQ. You did not forget the dangerous machine you were handling at all did you?\u2014A. I don't think so.\n* * * * *\nQ. You were of course aware that the cap holding down the sulphuric acid would have o be tight or there would be danger?\u2014A. Certainly.\n* * * * *\nI shall presently comment upon the excuse the respond\u00adent proffers. At this point, I wish to emphasize again the fact that the respondent had assumed charge of the machine under the authority given by the by-law, that is to say, he had assumed the duty of \"director of operations\" on behalf of the municipality. In this capacity, he was bound to see that the responsibility resting upon the municipal\u00adity, in respect of the precautions to be observed in work\u00ading the machine, were, so far as reasonably possible, discharged. That duty he owed to the municipality.\nThe respondent's justification for his heedless act is that the \"fire chief \" had been instructed to keep the extin\u00adguishers in good order and he assumed that he had done his duty.\nI do not desire to speak with severity, but I cannot for-bear observing that unless we are to put out of sight com\u00adpletely the considerations just mentioned, it is difficult to take this explanation seriously. The respondent knew, as everybody did, that the extinguishers were kept in ,a place open to the public by day, \"uncovered, and unprotected in any manner from the curious and the meddlesome, and that it might be made unsafe very easily by a simple turn of the wrench \", to quote Turgeon, J.A.; he knew, of course, none better, that the village constable, the caretaker of the rink, receiving a wage of $30 a month, who acted as \"fire chief \", was not intended to keep these machines under constant guard; that consistently with due attention to his other duties, a periodical inspection was the utmost that could be expected from him; and the respondent himself says that Clarke would have discharged his duty by inspec\u00adtion once a month.\nIt seems unnecessary to say that the danger which attended the working of the machine depended upon the state of the tank, not in the previous month or week or day, but upon its state at the moment; and that the duty of the respondent to take precautions, was a duty to be exercised with reference to the conditions of the moment, and not to those of some anterior time.\nReverting to the excuse advanced, I do not accept the argument that, in any relevant sense the respondent was entitled \" to assume \" that Clarke \" had done his duty \". Having regard to the magnitude of the danger to which the unsuspecting bystanders were exposed, if the cap was not securely fastened, the respondent was not acting reasonably in taking it for granted, as a fact governing his actions, that Clarke, in exercising his functions, had been at all times free from the common human faults of inattention, forgetfulness or even. neglect; ordinary care involves, in the circumstances in which the respondent was acting, the highest degree of care; he was not proceeding conformably to that standard in staking the safety of the bystanders upon the assumption which he puts forward as his excuse. But let us put this aside. Let us suppose that Clarke had performed every duty expected of him in his capacity as \" fire chief \"; that he had examined the extinguisher, not within the preceding month (according to the notion of the respondent as to his duty), but within the preceding week, or for that matter, within the preceding twenty-four hours, and that, in fact, he had left the cap securely fast\u00adened; and let us suppose, furthermore, that this was known to the respondent. I do not agree that in such circum\u00adstances, knowing also, as the respondent did, that the machine had, in the meantime, to quote Turgeon, J.A., again, been exposed in a place open to the public \"uncovered, and unprotected in any manner from the curious and the meddlesome \", and that it might have been \" made unsafe very easily \" by a touch of the hand\u2014I am unable ' to agree that such knowledge would have afforded an answer to a claim by Martin, for example, whose clothes were ruined, and who only escaped disfigurement because the respondent's body served him as a shield.\nHaving regard to the ease with which the cap could be loosened, and the risk, so vividly described by Turgeon, J.A., of its being found in that condition, and the simple nature of the precaution required, a finding exonerating the respondent from responsibility in face of such a claim could not, in my judgment, be sustained as reasonable.\nThe direct and proximate cause of the respondent's pain\u00adful injuries was, I regret to say, his own neglect.\nThis is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. But I cannot take leave of the case without commenting upon another aspect. The learned trial judge told the jury:\u2014\nThe by-law makes him a director of operations, but in terms the by-law does not require him o check over the machinery to see that it is in good order. He was entitled o assume, unless he had a good reason to know, such a good reason that he ought to know to the contrary, he was entitled o assume that the municipality had performed its duty to have this machine in safe and proper condition for use and operation. The duty was imposed upon them by law to do so, and he was entitled as all men are entitled to assume that they had performed their duty.\nUnfortunately, the case, perhaps, has become a little obscured by the use of vague general language to describe a simple concrete matter. The controversy at the trial turned, as it now turns, upon the responsibility for the act by which, on the occasion of the fire, the sulphuric acid was released and became mixed with the solution of bicar\u00adbonate of soda, at a moment when the simple precaution (to securely fasten the metal dome) known by everybody to be essential, had not been observed.\nThe passage quoted would, in light of the preceding passages in the charge, convey to the jury the idea that the law imposed upon the municipality the duty to see that, at all times, whether the tank was in use ,or not in use, the dome was so fastened, and that the respondent was entitled to assume this duty had been performed. Nei\u00adther the respondent, nor anybody, supposed for a moment that such a duty rested upon the municipality; and the respondent knew that the municipality had made no pre\u00adtence of performing such a duty. In laying down such a rule for the guidance of the jury, the learned judge was plainly wrong; and the mischief could not be corrected by some not very precise observations as to what the respondent might be presumed to know as to the practice.\nThe learned judge quite failed to make it plain to the jury, as he should have done, that, as regards precautions, the critical moment was the moment when the bottle was broken, and that, in the circumstances, the duty, not to break the bottle in the absence of the obvious precaution, was a duty of the most imperative character.\nThe learned judge also gravely erred in rejecting the evidence of Mr. Furby, an inspector for the fire commis\u00adsioner of the province. The learned judge had, as we have seen, instructed the jury that it was the duty of the muni\u00adcipality, a duty imposed by law, to have the machine at all times \" in safe and proper condition for use and operation.\" The negligence imputed by the jury to the appellants was \" in not having \" the extinguisher \" kept in perfect work\u00ading order.\" It is plain from this answer that the charge had created, in the minds of the jury, the impression that the duty defined by the learned judge in respect of the maintenance of the machine, was a duty owing to the re\u00adspondent, in the circumstances in which the respondent took possession of the machine; and, further, that this duty involved the obligation to have the metal dome fastened tight at that moment. I pass over the question as to the character of the duty (if any), as to the condition of the machine at that moment, owing by the municipality to the respondent. Even if the rule were accepted, as the jury understood the learned judge to have laid it down, viz., that the municipality was under an obligation to keep the extinguisher \" in perfect working order,\" it is not open to dispute, on that hypothesis, the jury should have been in\u00adstructed that, in passing upon the question whether the obligation had been performed, they should consider very carefully whether the extinguisher was not in fact \" in per\u00adfect working order \" or \" in safe and proper condition for use and operation.\" The learned judge ought also to have told the jury that in considering that question, they must take into account the ordinary and proper method of work\u00ading the machine. Obviously, it would be difficult to say whether or not the machine was in perfect working order without knowing how the machine was to be worked.\nI find myself quite at a loss to conceive on what ground the evidence of the inspector for the fire commissioner could properly be withdrawn from the attention of the jury. The proper method of working the machine, he ex\u00adplained, is not to break the bottle until after the exit into the hose is opened and the metal dome securely fastened. He explained that instruction to this effect is regularly given to the fire chiefs in the cities, towns and villages of the province, as well as to councillors. This was evidence, not merely as to the proper method of working the machine, but evidence, also, as to the known and recognized method of working it, and it ought not to have been withdrawn from the jury. The jury should have been told that, if that evidence was accepted, they could not properly find that the machine was not \" in perfect working order \" when it came into the hands of the respondent.\nIt is clear to me, as I have already said, that the respond\u00adent's claim fails, because his injuries were due, not to the violation of any duty which the municipality owed to him, but to his own neglect to perform his duty to the bystand\u00aders and the municipality; but, for the reasons that I have just given, it is equally plain that if the action were not to be dismissed, there must be a new trial on account of the errors into which the learned trial judge fell in his charge to the jury.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed. The appellants would perhaps consider whether they should ask for costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gordon de Gordon.

The conversation was overhead by W. (an employee of plaintiff) who was in an adjoining dressing room and was able to hear because of a small hole (covered over) which firemen had cut in the wall. Neither defendant nor plaintiff knew that W. was in the dressing room or that a person there could overhear what was said in the dispensary. At the trial of the action (for slander), on motion at close of plaintiff\u2019s case, Adamson J. held that there was no evidence of publication, withdrew the case from the jury, and dismissed the action. The Court of Appeal for Manitoba (39 Man. It. 442) ordered a new trial. Defendant appealed.\nHeld, affirming judgment of the Court of Appeal, that there should be a new trial.\nWhat may amount to actionable publication, proof thereof, matters to be considered and onus of proof with regard to them, discussed at length and authorities reviewed.\nPer Anglin C.J.C., Rinfret and Cannon JJ.: Assuming, but not deciding, that a defendant is not liable for a purely accidental communication to a third person who hears him utter a slander, the defendant not knowing, nor having any reason to suppose, that any person other than the plaintiff is within earshot, and being free from any fault leading to the communication to the third person; yet, in this case, there was explicit affirmative evidence of negligence of defendant, which was proper for submission to the jury, in the fact that defendant, being angry, raised his voice; and it must be for the jury to say whether, under all the circumstances of time and place, etc., such raising of his voice amounted to fault on his part so as to make him responsible for W. overhearing what he said.\nPer Duff J.: When the defamatory matter is intended only for the plaintiff but is unintentionally communicated to another person, the responsibility must, generally speaking, depend upon whether communication to that other person, or to somebody in a similar situation, ought to have been anticipated. Where the communication is the direct result of the defendant\u2019s act, the burden is upon him to show that the communication was not the result of his negligence. As regards proof of publication, the law recognizes no distinction between cases in which express malice in uttering the defamatory words is proved and those in which it is not.\nPer Lamont J.: Defendant must be taken to have intended the natural and probable consequence of his utterance, which was that all persons of normal hearing who were within the carrying distance of his voice would hear what he said. When, therefore, it was established that W. did hear what he said, a prima facie case of publication was made out, and, to displace that prima facie case, the onus was on defendant to satisfy the jury, not only that he did not intend that anyone other than plaintiff should hear him, but also that he did not know and had no reason to expect that any of the staff or any other person might be within hearing distance, and that he was not guilty of any want of care in not foreseeing the probability of the presence of someone within hearing range of the speaking tones which he used.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba (1) allowing the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the judgment of Adamson J., who, on motion made on behalf of the defendant at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case in the trial of an action for damages for alleged slander, non-suited the plaintiff, discharged the jury, and dismissed the action, on the ground that there was no evidence of publication of the slander complained of. The Court of Appeal[1] ordered a new trial.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Anglin, C.J.C., now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nH. A. Bergman, K.C., for the appellant.\nWard Hollands, K.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Anglin, C.J.C., and Rinfret and Cannon, JJ. was delivered by\nAnglin, C.J.C.\u2014I take the following statement of facts from the Appellant\u2019s factum in this case:\n\u201cThe plaintiff (respondent) had leased a store on Portage avenue, in the City of Winnipeg, from A. R. McNichol Limited, where she carried on a drug store and tea shop business in the name of a Limited Company. The defendant (appellant) was the Managing Director of the landlord company. On or about the 27th day of March, A.D. 1930, a fire occurred in the basement of the drug store, or of the building in which the store was, following which an interview took place, on or about the 4th day of April, A.D. 1930, between the defendant and the plaintiff in the dispensary of the drug store, at which interview the defendant is alleged to have slandered the plaintiff in the hearing of one witness, Kathleen Wilson * * * The learned trial judge at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, on motion to withdraw the case from the jury, held that there was no evidence of publication of the slander complained of, and accordingly withdrew the case from the jury. On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[2], the Court of Appeal were unanimous in allowing the appeal and ordered a new trial.\u201d\nTo this, should be added the statement that Kathleen Wilson was assistant manager in the plaintiff\u2019s drug establishment.\nUpon the occasion in question, she went into the dressing room-to hang up her coat and hat immediately after defendant McNichol had come into the building. Her attention was drawn to the conversation between him and the plaintiff by the loud, angry tone in which he spoke. She was interested and then listened carefully and overheard the entire conversation, as she was able to do because of a small hole which had been cut by firemen in the wall between the dressing room and the adjoining dispensary, where the plaintiff and defendant were together, and where the hole was covered by a piece of cardboard hung over it, which effectually concealed its presence. The angry, loud tone in which the defendant made the remarks declared upon as slanderous is emphasized by both the plaintiff and Miss Wilson in testifying, and of this there is no contradiction in the evidence before us. It seems somewhat extraordinary to me, however, that neither the plaintiff\u2019s husband, nor a gentleman with him, a chemist named Dodds, who were in the front part of the store, overheard the conversation. The facts that Miss Wilson was in the dressing room, and that a person there would be in a position to overhear what was said in the dispensary, were, at the time, unknown to either the plaintiff or defendant.\nThe question is thus clearly presented whether or not knowledge by the defendant of the ability of the only third person claimed to have been within earshot, to hear a slander alleged to have been uttered by him, is or is not essential to its publication by him. This constituted the first ground of appeal by the defendant from the order of the Court of Appeal, reversing the trial judge and ordering a new trial.\nA further ground of the appeal was that the occasion was one of qualified privilege and that the record contains no evidence of the express malice requisite to destroy such privilege.\nIn view of the disposition which we make of this appeal, we follow our usual practice of referring to and commenting on the evidence only so far as necessary to indicate the ground of our judgment.\nAssuming that the occasion was one of qualified privilege, it is perfectly clear that the record affords evidence from which express malice might (we do not say should) be inferred by a jury.\nThe material part of the cause of action in dispute is not the uttering, but the publication, of the language used (Hebditch v. MacIlwaine[3], O\u2019Keefe v. Walsh[4]). \u201cTo give a cause of action there must be a publication by the defendant. That is the foundation of the action.\u201d (per Bray J. in Powell v. Gelston[5].\nHow little may sometimes amount to proof of publication is illustrated in Duke of Brunswick v. Harmer[6]. (But, compare Osborn v. Thomas Boulter & Son[7]). But, for the purposes of a civil action, the intent of the person uttering the slander may, under some circumstances, be material; yet, we are told that,\npublication can be effected by any act on the part of the defendant which conveys the defamatory meaning of the matter to the person to whom it is communicated. (Gatley on Libel and Slander, 2nd Ed., p. 92.)\nHere, communication was clearly by an \u201cact\u201d of the defendant. As Mr. Odgers has said, in illustrating the doctrine, that an accidental or inadvertent communication is a sufficient publication, if it be occasioned by any act or default of the speaker or writer,\nI slander the plaintiff, believing I am alone in the room with him. But I speak so loudly that his clerk in the outer office hears what I say. This is a publication by me to the plaintiff\u2019s clerk. It is my fault that I speak so loud. (Odgers on Libel, 6th Ed., 137.)\nIn illustrating the doctrine that the onus lies on the plaintiff to prove publication,\u2014\u201che must prove a publication by the defendant,\u201d\u2014at p. 134, the same learned author says:\nTo shout defamatory words on a deserted moor where no one can hear you, is not a publication. But if anybody chances to hear you, it is a publication, although you thought no one was by.\nA question we might have to consider carefully is how far the limitation put upon the effect of communication to a third person, viz., that the defendant was in some manner at fault in making it, is well founded. Mr. Gatley, at p. 96, says:\nThe defendant is liable for an involuntary or unintentional publication of defamatory matter to a third person unless he can show that it was not due to any want of care on his part,\nand, two sentences further on, he says:\nSimilarly, A. will be liable if he utters defamatory words in so loud a voice that B. overhears what he says, unless he can show that he did not know and had no reason to suppose that anyone was within hearing,\nciting the New Zealand case of Hill v. Balkind[8].\nBut where the publication was neither intentional nor due to any want .of care on the defendant\u2019s part, he will not be liable therefor, (p. 97.)\nIt will be noted that, in this New Zealand case, the burden of proof was put upon the defendant to establish that he had no reason to suppose that anyone was within hearing, communication in fact having been established. In this case the defence of privilege would seem to have been the chief matter for consideration. In the result, a new trial was ordered on the ground that there was some evidence of express malice, though of very slight value, for the consideration of a jury, and that the issue of malice should have been allowed to go to them.\nWhile \u201cpublication\u201d was discussed, no definite conclusion was reached upon the sufficiency of the publication in that case where\ndefendant\u2019s statement (alleged to be slanderous) was overheard by a witness whose presence within hearing was not proved to have been known to defendant or arranged by plaintiff. The headnote merely says:\u2014\nSemble, that, if defendant did not know and had no reason to suppose that there was anybody within hearing when he used the words complained of, the words were not published.\nFor this proposition, Huth v. Huth[9] is cited by the learned judge. That, however, was entirely a different case from Hill v. Balkind[10], and also from the case now before us. There, a libellous letter had been opened by a butler in the house of the lady to whom it was addressed. It was opened merely out of curiosity. Admittedly, the butler had no right to open the letter. His wrongful act was, therefore, the cause of publication to himself,\u2014a clear case of novus actus interveniens. Referring to the last-mentioned ease, Gatley says (at p. 98):\nA fortiori, the defendant will not be liable where the defamatory matter is made known by the act of a third person for which the defendant can in no way be held responsible.\nIt seems unnecessary to determine the question whether or not a defendant, who is not in any way to blame, is responsible for a purely accidental communication to a third person who hears him utter a slander, he having no knowledge of the fact, and no reason to suppose, that any person was within earshot at the time he uttered the slander to the plaintiff. The authorities on the law of libel are quite numerous to the effect that an unintentional or accidental publication of a libel to a third person may be sufficient to create liability. For instance, Shepheard v. Whitaker[11]; Stubbs v. Marsh[12]; Weld-Blundell v. Stephens[13]; Tompson v. Dashwood[14], where a letter was sent to the wrong person by mistake, publication was held to be established (disapproved of on another ground in Hebditch v. MacIlwaine[15]).\nOn the other hand, in many cases it has been held that where, without any apparent fault on the part of the defendant, an accidental publication of a libel on the plaintiff to a third person is made, no responsibility rests upon him. Thus, in Keogh v. Dental Hospital[16], we find Lord O\u2019Brien, L.C.J., saying:\nAs to the publication, I think there was no evidence fixing responsibility upon the defendants. No doubt they may have known that the plaintiff practised dentistry work, but they did not know, nor might they have known, nor was there any presumption that they knew, that the plaintiff had a clerk who, in his absence, was authorized to open letters addressed to him.\nSmith v. Wood[17], a decision of Lord Ellenborough, cited by Dodd J. in Keogh v. Dental Hospital[18], seems to be much in point. See. too, Jackson v. Staley[19], and Emmens v. Pottle et al.[20], though in this latter case the burden would seem to have been thrown upon the defendant to prove that it was not due to any negligence on his part that he was ignorant that the newspaper contained a libel, and that he had no knowledge, and had no ground for supposing, that the newspaper was likely to contain libellous matter. (Reg. v. Lovett[21]).\nIn Gomersall v. Davies[22], the facts that a letter was opened in the ordinary course of business by a clerk in the plaintiff\u2019s employment, and that\nto the defendant\u2019s knowledge letters addressed to the plaintiff and received in the ordinary course of business would be likely to be opened by persons in the plaintiff\u2019s employment,\nwere held to afford sufficient evidence that there had been publication by the defendant. See, too, Delacroix v. Thevenot[23], and Weld-Blundell v. Stephens[24].\nIn Powell v. Gelston[25], on the other hand, the fact that a letter addressed to the son of H.W.P. was opened by his father, at whose request the son had written\u2014a fact unknown to the defendant\u2014asking for information, which proved to be libellous, to be communicated to him confidentially, the defendant also being unaware that his letter would be opened by any other than the person to whom it was addressed, was held not to constitute proof of publication by the defendant.\nIn Sharp v. Skues[26], it was said by the Master of Rolls that\nit would be a publication if the defendant intended the letter to be opened by a clerk or some third person not the plaintiff, or if to the defendant\u2019s knowledge it would be opened by a clerk, and, because these facts had been explicitly negatived by the jury, it was held that there had been no publication. Bray J. said, at the conclusion of his judgment in Powell v. Gelston[27]:\nThe son was asking for an answer that he and he alone would see. The answer of the defendant was intended for the son alone.\n(See, too, McLeod v. St. Aubyn[28]).\nThe result of all these cases, it may be, is that the weight of authority favours the view that (although, under some circumstances, merely accidental communication to a third person, not intended by the defendant, may suffice to hold him responsible for publication) where communication was not intended by him, and he neither had reason to know or to suspect that any other person was within hearing, when he addressed his slanderous statement to the plaintiff, with whom he thought he was alone at the time, he should not be held to have published to a third person who accidentally overhears, unless he can be charged with some fault leading to the communication to such third person. (Salmond on Torts, 7th Ed., pp. 531-2). But, the cases also would rather seem to support the view that, upon proof of communication in fact, whether consciously or unconsciously, to a third person, by the act of the defendant, the burden is cast upon him to establish innocence of any fault on his part leading thereto; and, in Emmens v. Pottle[29], the headnote ends with the following quaere:\nBut whether such a person can escape liability for the libel if he knows, or ought to know, that the newspaper is likely to contain libellous matter?\nindicating some lingering doubt in the minds of the court,\u2014possibly as to the question of burden of proof. Lord Esher, in the course of his judgment, said:\nI agree that the defendants are prima facie liable. They have handed to other people a newspaper in which there is a libel on the plaintiff. I am inclined to think that this called upon the defendants to shew some circumstances which absolve them from liability, not by way of privilege, but facts which shew that they did not publish the libel. * * * Upon the findings of the jury, we must take it that the defendants did not know that the paper contained a libel. * * * The case is reduced to this, that the defendants were innocent disseminators of a thing which they were not bound to know was likely to contain a libel. That being so, I think the defendants are not liable for the libel, (pp. 356-7.)\nBowen L.J. adds:\nA newspaper is not like a fire; a man may carry it about without being bound to suppose that it is likely to do an injury. * * * But I by no means intend to say that the vendor of a newspaper will not be responsible for a libel contained in it, if he knows, or ought to know, that the paper is one which is likely to contain a libel, (p. 358.)\nInteresting, however, as the questions above discussed undoubtedly are, we do not find it necessary to decide them; and we expressly refrain from doing so. Assuming that they should be determined in the defendant\u2019s favour, nevertheless, in our opinion, there is here explicit, affirmative evidence of negligence of the defendant, which was proper for submission to the jury, in the fact that the defendant, being angry, raised his voice,\u2014it may be in the belief that no one could hear him, or it may be that he was reckless whether anyone could hear him or not. In this connection, the circumstances of time and place must be borne in mind,\u2014the time being a comparatively busy hour of the day, and the place being alleged to have been one where others were not unlikely to be within hearing. At all events, it must be for the jury to say whether, under the circumstances, such raising of his voice amounted to fault on the part of the defendant so as to make him responsible for Miss Wilson overhearing what was said, as she did.\nFor this reason alone, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which set aside the dismissal of the action by the learned trial judge and directed that it must go back to the jury for a new trial. The appeal will, accordingly, be dismissed with costs.\nDuff, J.\u2014I agree that there must be a new trial. Publication takes place where the defamatory matter is brought by the defendant or his agent to the knowledge and understanding of some person other than the plaintiff; but when the communication is intended only for one person, and in fact, the defamatory matter is, without any intention on the part of the defendant, communicated to another, the responsibility must, generally speaking, depend upon the answer to the question whether communication to the last-mentioned person or to somebody in a similar situation ought to have been anticipated. Where the communication is the direct result of the defendant\u2019s act, it seems reasonable, as well as in consonance with the general principles of liability, that the burden should be upon the defendant to show that the communication which is the subject of complaint was not the result of his negligence; and that, I think, is the rule. A question may possibly arise whether, where the act of the defendant in uttering the defamatory words is malicious in the sense of the law of defamation, the defendant is to be taken to have acted at his peril, and is responsible for communication in fact, even in the absence of negligence.\nThere is no authority establishing a distinction, as regards proof of publication, between cases in which express malice is proved and those in which it is not. Such a distinction might tend to confuse a jury, the tribunal prescribed by law, in most of the provinces, for actions of defamation. I think the law recognizes no such distinction.\nLamont, J.\u2014I concur in the conclusion reached by my Lord the Chief Justice that this appeal should be dismissed, and will state shortly my reasons for thinking there was evidence to go to the jury on the question of publication.\nIn an action of slander the onus is upon the plaintiff to prove publication in fact by the defendant, in this sense, that it is publication for which the defendant is responsible. Where statements defamatory of a plaintiff have been uttered by a defendant and overheard by a third person the first inquiry in determining the defendant\u2019s responsibility is: Did he intend that anyone but the plaintiff should hear his defamatory utterances? In ascertaining his intention we must proceed in accordance with the fundamental principle referred to by Swinfen Eady, L.J., in the case of Huth v. Huth[30], that a man must be taken to intend the natural and probable consequences of his act in the circumstances. In that case the defendant sent through the post in an unclosed envelope a written communication which the plaintiffs alleged was defamatory of them. The communication was taken out of the envelope and read by a butler who was a servant in the house at which the plaintiffs were staying. The butler did this out of curiosity and in breach of his duty. It was held that there was no publication by the defendant and that the case was properly withdrawn from the jury by the trial judge. The basis of the decision was that, although there had been publication to the butler, it was not publication for which the defendant was responsible, because there was no evidence that he knew or had reason to suspect or should have contemplated that a letter addressed to the plaintiffs and enclosed in an envelope \u201cbut unsealed and unstuck down\u201d would, in the ordinary course, be likely to be opened by the butler or any other servant before being delivered to the defendant\u2019s wife. In his judgment Bray J., at page 46, said:\u2014\nIn my opinion it is quite clear that, in the absence of some special circumstances, a defendant cannot be responsible for a publication which was the wrongful act of a third person. He cannot be said, except in special circumstances, to have contemplated it. It was not the natural consequence of his sending the letter, or writing, in the way in which he did.\nTo the same effect was the decision in Powell v. Gelston[31]. There a communication containing libellous matter was addressed by the defendant to F.W.P. in answer to inquiries made by him. It was opened by F.W.P.\u2019s father on whose behalf the inquiries had been made but of this the defendant was unaware. The communication was not seen by F.W.P. It was held that there was no publication by the defendant to the father because the jury found that the defendant did not \u201cknow or expect that the letter might probably be opened or seen by a third person other than the person to whom it was addressed.\u201d\nThe same principle was applied in Keogh v. Dental Hospital[32], where, at page 587, Lord O\u2019Brien, L.C.J., stated the ground for determining the defendant\u2019s responsibility in the following words:\u2014\nI think there was no evidence fixing responsibility upon the defendants. No doubt they may have known that the plaintiff practised dentistry work, but they did not know, nor might they have known, nor was there any presumption that they knew, that the plaintiff had a clerk who, in his absence, was authorized to open letters addressed to him.\nOn the other hand, there is a long line of authorities represented by Delacroix v. Thevenot[33] and Gomersall v. Davies[34], in which it has been held that, where a defendant, knowing that the plaintiff\u2019s letters were usually opened by his clerk, sent a libellous letter addressed to the plaintiff which was opened and read by the clerk lawfully and in the usual course of business, there was publication by the defendant to the plaintiff\u2019s clerk. In Powell v. Gelston (5)[35], Bray J. said:\u2014 Several cases were cited\u2014Delacroix v. Thevenot[36], Gomersall v. Davies[37] and Sharp v. Skues[38]. They show that where to the defendant\u2019s knowledge a letter is likely to be opened by a clerk of the person to whom it is addressed the defendant is responsible for the publication to that clerk. As Lord Ellenborough said in Delacroix v. Thevenot[39], it must be taken that such a publication was intended by the defendant. On the other hand, in Sharp v. Skues[40] Cozens-Hardy M.R., said: \u201cIt would be a publication if the defendant intended the letter to be opened by a clerk or some third person not the plaintiff, or if to the defendant\u2019s knowledge it would be opened by a clerk; but the jury had negatived this in the clearest terms, and under these circumstances it was impossible to hold that some act done by a partner or a clerk of the plaintiff by his direction and for his own convenience when absent from the office could be a publication.\u201d\nThen we have the further line of cases which shew that where a letter containing defamatory matter concerning the plaintiff has been negligently dropped by the defendant and picked up and read by a third person, the defendant will be held responsible for publication to the person picking it up and reading it. Weld-Blundell v. Stephens[41]. Also where a letter intended for one person was by mistake sent to another. Tompson v. Dashwood[42]. The defendant in these cases was held responsible because the publication was directly due to his want of care.\nThe facts in the case at bar clearly distinguish it from the case of Huth v. Huth[43] upon which the appellant relied. There the publication to the butler resulted from a breach of duty on his part which the defendant could not reasonably be called upon to foresee; while in the case before us the publication to Kathleen Wilson took place while she was performing her duties in the usual course of business, and was not brought about by any improper act of hers.\nThen can it be said that the defendant\u2019s ignorance (if he was ignorant, for he did not testify) of the presence of Miss Wilson in the dressing room, affords any answer to the plaintiff\u2019s claim? Applying the principles set out in the above authorities, we must take it that he intended the natural and probable consequences of his act. The natural and probable consequence of uttering the words used was that all persons of normal hearing who were within the carrying distance of his voice would hear what he said. When, therefore, it was established as a fact that Miss Wilson did overhear him utter the slanderous statements charged against him, a prima facie case of publication by him was made out and, in order to displace that prima facie case the onus was on him to satisfy the jury, not only that he did not intend that anyone other than the plaintiff should hear him, but also that he did not know and had no reason to expect that any of the staff or any other person might be within hearing distance, and that he was not guilty of any want of care in not foreseeing the probability of the presence of someone within hearing range of the speaking tones which he used.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Aikins, Loftus, Aikins, Williams & MacAulay.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bonnar, Hollands & Philp.\n[1] 39 Man.

The defendant\u2019s appeal to the Appellate Division was dismissed (Fisher J.A. dissenting)[1], and the defendant appealed to this Court.\nThe question before this Court was, whether or not the closing by the plaintiff, for much of the winter period, of what was called the \u201cMain Inn,\u201d was, under the circumstances, a violation of the clause in the lease that the plaintiff\nwill continually conduct and carry on the business of a high-class Inn, to reasonably meet the requirements of its patronage and will use every reasonable means to secure all business possible for the success of the business.\nAfter hearing the arguments of counsel, the Court reserved judgment, and on a subsequent day delivered judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.

Bliss by reason of such injuries. The Honourable Mr. Justice Ives, at the trial, gave judgment for the appellant; but his judgment was unanimously reversed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta.

The Appellate Division, even assuming that the trial judge considered that no warning had been given, and, if given, it had been insufficient, thought that the circumstances of the case were such at the time of the accident, having in mind the limited rate of speed of the truck, as to dispense with the necessity for any warning and that consequently no negligence can be attributed to the respondent and that he had discharged the onus cast upon him by the Act.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada was of the opinion that the respondent failed to prove that the damage did not arise through his negligence and therefore, allowed the appeal with costs, restored the judgment of the trial judge, whose assessment of damages was not found to be excessive.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nA.

Among the respondent\u2019s ordinary duties was that of carrying the ashes out of the boiler room and depositing them outside the building in a shed adjoining. For this purpose it was his custom to make use of a wheelbarrow, and he was obliged, after crossing the main room in the basement, to mount an inclined gangway about 18 inches wide to reach the platform on which the ashes were to be dumped. Early in the morning of the 5th of December, the light which should have illuminated the inclined gangway had failed, and in attempting to push his barrow up this inclined plane to the platform, the respondent, owing to the lack of light, misjudged his position; the wheelbarrow toppled from the gangway and precipitated the respondent to the floor. As a result of his fall he suffered a broken leg, which has left him permanently crippled. The trial judge found that the accident was due to the failure of the electric light which should have been kept in good condition, and that the appellant\u2019s failure to do so imposed upon it the liability for the respondent\u2019s injuries, which he fixed at the sum of $3,000; which judgment was affirmed by the appellate court.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the appeal, but was of the opinion that it was a case for division of damages, the appellant to bear four-fifths; the respondent, however, to bear his own costs of both appeals, but to be entitled to the costs of the action.\nAppeal dismissed.\nAlex.

One Mrs. Marie Anne Carreau, the alleged wife of the respondent, was standing on the sidewalk just behind the motor truck and when the street car she was waiting for came along she left the sidewalk to reach the street car, but, before reaching the street car, she was hit by the truck of the appellant suddenly started on reverse in order to avoid another accident. She was thrown on the pavement and she suffered a broken wrist. The respondent alleged that he was married to Mrs. Carreau, in the province of Quebec and that they passed a marriage contract stating that they would be in community as to property, and he therefore took alone the action in damages against the appellant for $15,537.10.\nThe appellant, by his contestation, declared that he was ignorant of the alleged marriage between the plaintiff and Mrs. Carreau and declined responsibility on the ground that the accident was due to the negligence of Mrs. Carreau herself. Judgment was given in the Superior Court by Loranger J. for $3,087.10, which judgment was affirmed by the appellate court.\nThe grounds of appeal were that the alleged marriage between the respondent and Mrs. Marie Anne Carreau had not been legally proven and, therefore, the respondent had absolutely no ground of action; the appellant submitted that article 159 C.C. made it imperative on the respondent to file the certificate of his marriage with Mrs. Carreau, and that even the appellant had no right to make an admission of their marriage, because such admission would be against public order. The other ground was that the amount of the judgment had been arrived at on an erroneous basis, and that it was therefore exorbitant, arbitrary and most exaggerated and far in excess of the damages which had been suffered by Mrs. Carreau.\nThe first ground was set aside by the appellate court for the reason that marriage had been proved as a result of the questions put by the appellant\u2019s counsel to the respondent upon his examination on discovery and that there was no question of public order; and, on the second ground, the appellate court affirmed the amount of damages.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing counsel for the appellant and for the respondent, delivered judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nLs.

Mellish J. concurred with Ross J. Paton J. concurred in that portion of the judgment of Ross J. deciding that plaintiff as an undisclosed principal was unable to maintain the action, but on the other point (as to a contract having been made), agreed with the conclusion of the trial judge. Carroll J. concurred in allowing the defendant\u2019s appeal. Chisholm J. held that a contract was made, and that, if the law as to the right of an undisclosed foreign principal to sue on an agreement defeated the plaintiff\u2019s action, the dismissal of the action ought to be on terms. In the result, the defendant\u2019s appeal was allowed with costs, and the action dismissed with costs.\nOn the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing the arguments of counsel, the Court reserved judgment, and on a subsequent day delivered judgment dismissing the appeal with costs. Written reasons were delivered by Newcombe J., with whom the other members of the Court concurred, in which, after reviewing the evidence, and pointing out that the judgment of the trial judge did not rest upon any finding adverse to the defendant relating to credibility, but rather upon his interpretation of what was said, and inferences drawn from the material facts which were not in dispute, he stated that, after carefully examining the proof, he was, \u201cwith all due respect to the learned judges who think otherwise, in full agreement with the learned judges en banc where they deny any evidence in the case upon which it can justly be found that the respondent (defendant) contracted an obligation to supply the large flat cars that Mr. Harlow failed to obtain\u201d; and that, having reached this conclusion, it was unnecessary to consider the other point concerning the plaintiff\u2019s alleged incapacity as an undisclosed foreign principal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nJ.

On the 19th of December, 1901, the city of Cumberland entered into an agreement with the Cumberland Electric Light Company giving the company the right to instal and operate an electric light plant within the municipality, such rights to exist for a period of fifty years, subject to the right of the municipality to purchase the undertaking, property rights and privileges of the company at any time at a price agreed upon, or in default of agreement, as found by arbitration. In 1929 the municipality decided to take over the undertaking, and as the parties could not come to terms as to price, arbitrators were appointed and made an award, fixing the value of the undertaking, property rights and privileges of the company at $74,000, and they found that of this sum of $74,000 the sum of $36,000 was the value of the physical assets, the \" physical assets \" being defined as made up of the \" fixed assets and supplies on hand.\"\nThe Court of Appeal held that the agreement was giving the city the right to purchase the whole undertaking; that the submission was to assess the value of the \" undertaking, property rights and privileges of the company,\" and that the price to be paid should represent the value of the whole\n[Page718]\nundertaking and was not restricted to the \"physical assets\" of the company.\nThe grounds of appeal submitted to the Supreme Court of Canada were that the judgment of the Court of Appeal was erroneous, in point of law, in that by the notice of purchase dated the 30th day of July, 1929, the franchise to supply electric light to the inhabitants of the municipality did in fact and in law terminate on that date; that being so, there was no period for which the arbitrators could allow $38,000 or any sum for prospective loss of profits. The agreement should be construed in the light of the fact that the appellant corporation had no power to buy back and pay for the franchise granted. The appellant corporation was the creature of the statute, R.S.B.C, 1924, c. 179, and as such had no power to deal in its own franchises to that extent.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing counsel for the appellant and for the respondent, reserved judgment; and, later, dismissed the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nN.

The action was for the price of two snow ploughs. The defence was that the ploughs delivered were not as ordered or represented and were not accepted by the defendant.\nOn the appeal to this Court, after hearing the arguments of counsel, the Court reserved judgment, and on a subsequent day delivered judgment allowing the defendant\u2019s appeal with costs in this Court and in the Appellate Division, and restoring the judgment of the trial judge. Written reasons were delivered by Anglin C.J.C. (with whom Rinfret J. concurred), by Newcombe J., and by Smith J. (with whom Cannon J. concurred).\nAnglin C.J.C. (Rinfret J. concurring) stated that, on the evidence, he was convinced that the trial judge was entirely right in his findings. He pointed out that, the moment it appeared that the description, in each of the written contracts, of the ploughs sold was equivocal, that opened the door for the admission of parol evidence to identify the subject matter intended by the parties\u2014if, indeed, such evidence is not always admissible to identify the true subject matter, when in dispute. After reviewing the evidence at length, he held that, on the whole evidence, it was very apparent that the differences between the ploughs bought and those furnished were quite sufficient to justify the rejection by the defendant of the two ploughs sent out by the plaintiffs; as the case was put by appellant\u2019s (defendant\u2019s) counsel,\u2014either the parties were ad idem as to the subject matter of the contract and, if so, it clearly was two ploughs the same as that seen in the City of Ottawa garage by Leclair (the defendant\u2019s representative), and suitable for work on bush roads, which could be attached to a Linn tractor in such a manner as not to interfere with the loading of supplies on the tractor platform (if need be, the written contracts should be reformed to evidence this arrangement, the testimony in the record being quite sufficient to justify that being done), or the parties were never ad idem, Leclair ordering two ploughs of the above type and Soper thinking that he was ordering two Frink \u201cV\u201d type ploughs with standard Linn attachments; in any case, the action fails.\nNewcombe J. held that the parties were not ad idem, and that, without attempting to distribute the responsibility for this, the plaintiffs must fail. Smith J. (Cannon J. concurring) held that the trial judge\u2019s finding as to the kind of ploughs intended by the parties was justified by the evidence; that evidence was admissible to shew the meaning that both parties attached to the description of the article appearing in the written orders; and that the outfits delivered were entirely different from the outfits described, according to the understanding of both parties as to the meaning of that description at the time it was used.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nW.F.

She claimed against the defendants respondents, Wilson & Wilson, a firm of solicitors at Prince George, British Columbia, because, purporting to act as her solicitors, they consented, on her behalf without authority from her, to have an action which was brought in the Supreme Court of British Columbia tried by a judge of the County Court of Cariboo. She claimed against the defendant Strand, who was plaintiff in the Supreme Court action referred to, because he issued execution on what purported to be a judgment made by the judge of the County Court of Cariboo, which judgment she alleged was a nullity, and also because he caused her goods to be seized and sold to satisfy an execution which he had against one John Weisner. She claimed against the defendant respondent Peters, because, as sheriff of the county of Cariboo, he wrongfully seized and sold her goods and chattels; and she claimed against the Hudson's Bay Company, also respondent, because, having received her goods from the sheriff, they converted them to their own use. The relevant facts are: In the spring of 1908 one John Weisner, who for many years had been trading with the Indians in northern British Columbia, decided to give up business and to sell his river outfit. On April 9, 1928, he entered into the following agreement with Mrs. Overn-\nThis is to certify\nThat I\nJohn Henry Weisner have on this ninth day of April nineteen twentyeight sold and delivered over to Elizabeth Overn, White River B.C. all my interest in building and business situated on the east side of Finly River two hundred yards west of White River, one boat forty feet long eight feet beam & one Kermath Marine engine 35 horse power, two Johnson Kicker eight horse power, one Lockwood Kicker, one small boat, for the sum of one thousand dollars, good canadian money, $1,000.00\nJ. H. Weisner.\nWitness\nJ C Hasler\nMrs. Overn states that she paid the $1,000 in cash and there is no evidence to the contrary. She also states that she received no goods whatever from Weisner except those specifically mentioned above. After purchasing his river outfit Mrs. Overn employed Weisner to run the boats for her. In May, 1928, she took the boats to Prince George. While there Weisner introduced her to his solicitors, Wilson & Wilson, whom she consulted as to necessity of having the document of April 9th registered as, on the way out, Weisner had been served with a writ of summons at the instance of one Strand who claimed that Weisner owed him $2,286. On May 20th Mr. J. O. Wilson drew up a new bill of sale from Weisner to Mrs. Overn which was registered, and also an agreement in which Weisner authorized her to use his name in her business. She then purchased from the wholesale houses in Prince George and Edmonton goods to the amount of some six or seven thousand dollars for trading purposes. These she assembled in Prince George during the first half of June and placed them on board the boats. Shortly afterwards she started north. Some days later she and Weisner were served with writs of summons in an action by Strand to set aside the bill of sale. On June 29, Weisner, who could not read and who could only write sufficiently to sign his name, had Mrs. Overn draft a letter for him to his solicitors, Wilson & Wilson, asking them to act for him in the action. On the same day Mrs. Overn wrote a letter to the same solicitors in which she said:\u2014\nMr. Weisner have instructed me to write you I am not takin this case up with any lawyer in Prince George.\nMrs. Overn then went to the Post on White Water River, arriving there on July 15. The goods which she brought up she put in new buildings which she had erected for the purpose. On July 26, Wilson & Wilson wrote to Weisner, as follows:\u2014\nWe have your letter, also Mrs. Overn's letter and from what she says we take it she does not wish us to defend this action on her behalf. You might point out to her that if she does not defend the action, she will have no chance of defending it by way of an appeal later, as there is no appeal from a default judgment.\n* * * * *\nWe would like to have a word as to when you could possibly be here for trial, and whether Mrs. Overn wishes us to defend the action on her behalf.\nThis letter Mrs. Overn admits reading but says she did not consent to have Wilson & Wilson act for her. Weisner then went to Prince George and, according to Mr. Wilson, told him that Mrs. Overn wanted his firm to act for her as well as for himself. Wilson, however, because of Mrs. Overn's former letter, would not take the responsibility of acting on her behalf without something from her. Weisner then brought in Charles Overn, husband of Mrs. Overn, who, according to Mr. Wilson, told him his wife desired he should act on her behalf. Believing this, Mr. Wilson, on August 21, signed the following consent:\u2014\nThe plaintiff, by his solicitor, Mr. E. J. Avison, and the defendants, by their solicitor, Mr. P. E. Wilson, do hereby agree that the County Court of Cariboo, holden at Prince George, and His Honour Judge Robertson, the judge of that court, shall have jurisdiction and power to try this action; but this agreement shall not prejudice or effect any right of appeal of any of the parties. The trial took place the following day with the result that the bill of sale from Weisner to Mrs. Overn was set aside as fraudulent. The formal judgment, after declaring the sale set aside, contained the following paragraph:\u2014\nAnd this court doth declare that all stock-in-trade in the possession of the defendant, Elizabeth Overn, is in law the property of the defendant, John H. Weisner, and subject to the claims of his creditors.\nOn September 14th Strand issued execution against the goods of Weisner for $2,705.63 and the following day he issued execution against the goods of Mrs. Overn and of Weisner for $497.25 being the costs taxed against them in the action setting aside the bill of sale\u2014costs of execution and poundage. These writs were handed to the sheriff who forwarded them to J. D. McIntosh, his agent, who, on September 28, against the protests of Mrs. Overn, seized not only the river outfit but all the stock-in-trade which she, two months before, had brought to the Post and which, she says, were there worth $12,000. Next morning she left for Prince George. On October 4th McIntosh sold all the goods to the Hudson's Bay Company by private sale for $4,850. Some days later Mrs. Overn reached Prince George and called upon the defendants, Wilson & Wilson, and asked them for the papers in connection with the action, and a copy of the evidence. At this time these defendants knew she was on her way to Vancouver to consult her solicitors in reference to the matter. Next morning she went to Vancouver, consulted solicitors, and, on their advice, brought an appeal from the judgment of Judge Robertson. The Court of Appeal held that the appeal did not lie. Mrs. Overn then brought this action. It was tried before Chief Justice Morrison and a jury. The jury brought in a general verdict for the plaintiff giving her $10,000 for loss of stock-in-trade, and $1,000 general damages. Judgment was accordingly entered for her for $11,000. The defendants appealed and the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment below as to all defendants, except the defendant Strand, who did not appear to prosecute his appeal.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing counsel for the appellant and counsel for the respondents, reserved judgment; and, later on, rendered judgment allowing the appeal with costs and restoring the judgment of the trial judge, with the following variations: judgment against the respondents Wilson & Wilson to be restricted to the sum of $497.25 and the judgment against the other respondents, the sheriff Peters and the Hudson's Bay Company, for the balance of the sum of $11,000, and the amount for which judgment will be entered against the two last mentioned respondents to be settled by the Registrar if the parties differ as to same.\nAnglin C.J.C., in his reasons for judgment, stated that, on the evidence, it appeared that the plaintiff appellant \"never knowingly consented to any adjudication by the County Court of Cariboo, or by His Honour Judge Robertson, upon the validity of the Bill of Sale given to her by Weisner, and that she never knowingly or willingly acquiesced in, or ratified, the course taken by Messrs. Wilson & Wilson, who purported to represent her. The implied findings to that effect of the jury before which this action was tried, based, as they were, on a fair charge, to which the respondents took no exception at the trial, and of which they cannot now complain, are conclusive on this aspect of the case, the questions of original authority and ratification, primarily questions of fact, having been properly submitted for its determination; and, in so far as ratification may involve a question of law, in my opinion it has been satisfactorily dealt with by Lamont J. That being so, it follows that the judgment of Robertson Co.J., was pronounced without jurisdiction.\"\nLamont J., after having given his opinion on the questions of facts in this case, added the following remarks:\n\"The main defence of Wilson & Wilson, however, was that the appellant had, after full knowledge of what had been done in her name, ratified their acts.\n\"To constitute a binding adoption or ratification of an act done without previous authority in the name of a supposed principal, it must be established that the principal unequivocally adopted the act after full knowledge of all essential facts relating to the transaction, unless the circumstances warrant the clear inference that the principal was assuming all risks from the acts of the agent. The onus of proving such ratification rests upon the person al- leging it who must also prove full knowledge on the part of the principal. Wall v. Cockeril[2]. Ratification of an act may be express or implied. It will be implied whenever the conduct of the person on whose behalf the act was done is such as to shew that he intends to adopt or recognize the unauthorized act. Bowstead on Agency, 7th ed., 59. Ratification must be intentional. By it the principal is bound because he intends to be bound. If that intention cannot be shewn to exist no ratification can be held to have been established. In most cases the intention of the principal is to be gathered from his conduct and statements rather than from any express declaration of ratification. There are, however, certain classes of cases in which the courts have held that the conduct of the principal raised, in point of law, a conclusive presumption of his intention. Where goods have been wrongfully taken and sold the owner may either treat the taker as a tortfeasor and sue him for damages for wrongful conversion, or he may treat him as his agent to make the sale and sue him for the purchase price as money had and received.\n\"If he adopts this latter course and the taker pays over the purchase money received by him, the courts hold the owner to have elected conclusively to waive the tort and to treat the taker as his agent, and he cannot afterwards treat him as a wrongdoer. In Smith v. Baker[3], Bovill C.J. said:\u2014\nThe law is clear that a person who is entitled to complain of a conversion of his property, but who prefers to waive the tort, may do so and bring his action for money had and received for the proceeds of goods wrongfully sold.\n***\nBut if an action for money had and received is so brought that is in point of law a conclusive election to waive the tort; and so the commencement of an action of trespass or trover is a conclusive election the other way. The principles which govern the subject are very well illustrated in the case of Buckland v. Johnson[4], where it is held that the plaintiff having sued one of two joint tortfeasors in tort could not afterwards sue the other for money had and received. There may be other instances where an act may amount to a conclusive election in point of law to waive the tort. But there is another class of cases in which an act is of an ambiguous character, and may or may not be done with the intention of adopting and affirming the wrongful act. In such cases the question whether the tort has been waived becomes rather a matter of fact than of law. \"With this statement of the law A. L. Smith L.J. in Rice v. Reed[5], said he entirely agreed.\n\"In the case at Bar the respondents rely on two acts of the appellant as conclusively establishing ratification. They are:\n(1) That when she came out to Prince George in the early part of October, after the seizure of her goods, and obtained the papers relating to the action from Wilson & Wilson, she did not repudiate the acts done in her name or intimate that she did not consent thereto, and\n(2) That she took an appeal from Judge Robertson's order without setting up any want of authority on the part of Wilson & Wilson.\n\"As to the failure of the appellant to disavow the solicitor's acts on the ground of want of authority, it is, on the evidence, in my opinion, very doubtful if she had any clear comprehension of what had been done or of how the seizure of her goods had come about. Further, it has not been established that she had the necessary information to enable her to form any just conception of her rights. She had been in the wilderness, four hundred miles north of Prince George among the Indians, where there was not even a justice of the peace and where mail was delivered only once in every two or three months. She says that when her husband and Weisner came to White Water River, after the trial, they told her the case had been dismissed. She evidently learned that her husband had employed Wilson & Wilson but the respondents knew before she came down that she repudiated her husband's right to do this and also knew that when she did arrive she was on her way to consult solicitors in Vancouver as to her position and to ascertain by what right her goods had been taken. Wilson & Wilson were not under any impression that she was approving of what they had done; nor were they in any way misled.\n\"In support of their contention on this point counsel for the respondents referred to the language by Blackburn J. in Reynolds v. Howell[6], where, at page 400, that learned judge said:\u2014\nI may add that, in my opinion, if a plaintiff after action brought in his name by an attorney without authority hears of it, and does not repudiate it, he will be supposed to have ratified the attorney's acts. \"This rule, without doubt, is applicable to cases where, in the absence of repudiation, the solicitor and the other parties to the action would assume that authority had been given and that it was being continued, but it is not applicable, in my opinion, to cases where the work which the solicitor undertook, without authority, to do has been completed without the knowledge or consent of the principal. In De Bussche v. Alt[7], Thesiger L.J., said:\u2014\nIf a person having a right, and seeing another person about to commit, or in the course of committing an act infringing upon that right, stands by in such a manner as really to induce the person committing the act, and who might otherwise have abstained from it, to believe that he assents to its being committed, he cannot afterwards be heard to complain of the act.\n***\nBut when once the act is completed without any knowledge or assent upon the part of the person whose right is infringed, the matter is to be determined on very different legal considerations. A right of action has then vested in him which, at all events as a general rule, cannot be divested without accord and satisfaction, or release under seal.\n\"The appellant's failure to disavow the acts of Wilson & Wilson in signing the consent of August 21, cannot, in my opinion, as a matter of law be said to indicate an intention on her part to adopt as her own an act against which she has always protested as the cause of her trouble.\n\"Then can it be said that we are obliged upon any rule of law to hold that, by appealing to the Court of Appeal against the order of Judge Robertson, without setting up a want of authority on the part of Wilson & Wilson, the appellant has conclusively elected to ratify the consent given in her name?\n\"As already pointed out there are cases in which the taking of judicial proceedings by a principal, after knowledge of the unauthorized act of a person purporting to act as his agent, is conclusive of an election to ratify the act of such agent. The principle upon which these cases have been decided, as I read the authorities is that the principal by his judicial proceedings is held to have ratified the agent's act because the rights claimed by the principal in these proceedings can only be predicated upon the existence of the relationship of principal and agent, and could not be justified upon any other hypothesis. There are other cases, however, in which the taking of judicial proceedings, do not necessarily imply an intention to ratify the act of the agent. In these cases the question of intention is dealt with rather as a question of fact for the jury than as a question of law for the court.\n\"In Morris v. Robinson[8], a cargo of indigo had been improperly sold under an order of the Vice Admiralty Court and the proceeds paid into court. The owner of the cargo through his agent applied to have the money paid out to him. It was held that the application for payment out did not in law bar the owner from bringing an action in trover against the purchaser of the indigo. In his judgment Bayley J. pointed out that the application had not been successful and the owners were, therefore, in the same position as if no application had been made to the court.\n\"In Rice v. Reed[9], the plaintiff's servant had wrongfully sold the goods of his master to the defendant who knew that the servant was improperly dealing with them. The servant paid the proceeds of the sale into his account at his bank. The owner brought an action against the servant and the bank, claiming, as against the servant, damages for the conversion of the goods and in the alternative for money had and received; and, as against the bank, an injunction to restrain them respectively from drawing out the sum of \u00a31,500 then standing to the servant's credit at the bank. The plaintiff applied for and obtained an interim injunction but no further steps in the action were taken. An agreement was arrived at between the owner and the servant that \u00a31,125, out of the \u00a31,500 in the bank, should be paid over to the owner in full settlement of all his claims against the servant, but without prejudice to his claim against the defendant. The owner then brought an action against the defendant for conversion. It was held that the owner had not by obtaining an interim injunction in the former action and by his dealing with the servant elected to affirm the sale and to waive the tort, and the action against the defendant was maintainable. In his judgment Lord Russel C.J., at page 64, said:\u2014\nThis case would seem to establish the proposition that an application of a judicial kind to a judicial court to obtain the proceeds of goods improperly converted is not conclusive proof of election to affirm the sale. In the present case there was no application by the plaintiff to have the money in the bank paid out to him. In Ewing v. Dominion Bank[10], Lord Davey said:\u2014\nWhether the circumstances were such as would raise either an estoppel against the petitioners, or would amount to what Lord Blackburn in McKenzie v. British Linen[11] calls a \"ratification for a time\" by the supposed makers of the note of their signature, is, in the opinion of their Lordships, absolutely a question of fact.\n\"In the circumstances of the case at Bar the taking of the appeal does not, in my opinion, necessarily imply an intention to ratify the unauthorized acts of Wilson & Wilson. The order appealed from contained a clause which, taken by itself, would amount to a holding that all the stock-in-trade in possession of the appellant no matter how or from whom obtained, was the property of Weisner. And it may well be that the appellant's advisers thought that until the order was set aside on appeal that clause would be a bar to any action brought to recover the value of her goods. As this construction of the clause received support in the court below and was urged upon us, it is not unreasonable to say that the appeal may have been brought to set aside the order without any intention of ratifying the consent given by Wilson & Wilson. Ratification, not being necessarily implied from the taking of the appeal, the question of the appellant's intention was a question of fact for the jury and they negatived any such intention. The defence of Wilson & Wilson therefore fails, and they must be held liable for the loss suffered by the appellant by reason of their act. This loss, it is contended, was only the damage caused by the issue of the execution directing a levy on her goods for $497.25, and that the liability of these respondents should be limited to that item. In my opinion this contention is right. Marsh v. Joseph[12]; Jones v. Woodhouse[13].\n\"The defence of the sheriff is:\u2014\n\"(1) That in seizing and selling the property in question he was merely carrying out the direction of the court, and\n\"(2) That in any event all the goods seized and sold were the goods of Weisner.\n\"The sheriff seized under two writs of execution, one commanding him to make out of the goods of Elizabeth Overn and John H. Weisner the sum of $497.25; and the other to make out of the goods of John H. Weisner the sum of $2,705.63. Both writs were issued out of the Supreme Court Registry.\n\"It has long been established law that where a sheriff seizes and sells property under a writ of execution which is regular on its face and was issued out of a court of competent jurisdiction, he is protected by the writ unless the goods are not in fact the goods of the execution debtor. This protection he enjoys even although the order in which the writ is founded may, subsequently, be set aside for irregularity or is in fact a nullity.\n\"In Barker v. Braham[14], the Lord Chief Justice stated the rule as follows:\u2014\nA sheriff, or his officers, or any acting under his or their authority, may justify themselves by pleading the writ only, because that is sufficient for their excuse, although there be no judgment or record to support or warrant such writ; but if a stranger interposes and sets the sheriff to do an execution, he must take care to find a record that warrants the writ, and must plead it; so must the party himself at whose suit an execution is made.\n\"Whether the judgment or order justifies the issuing of the writ is in each case a question to be determined by the court issuing it, and not by the sheriff.\n\"In Ramanathan Chetty v. Meera Saibo Mariker[15], the Privy Council said:\u2014\nA distinction must be drawn between the acts done without judicial sanction and acts done under judicial sanction improperly obtained. If goods are seized under a writ or warrant which authorized the seizure, the seizure is lawful, and no action will lie in respect of the seizure, unless the person complaining can establish a remedy by some such action as for malicious prosecution. If, however, the writ or warrant did not authorize the seizure of the goods seized, an action would lie for damages occasioned by the wrongful seizure without proof of malice.\n\"The writ against the appellant's goods for $497.25 was regular on its face and the Supreme Court of British Columbia was competent to issue it. The sheriff was, therefore, justified in realizing out of her goods the amount called for by that writ. In doing so he was acting with judicial sanction and no action lies against him therefor. He, however, proceeded to sell the balance of the appellant's goods under an execution directing him to levy on the goods of John H. Weisner. The goods sold to satisfy this execution were the stock-in-trade of the appellant, pur- chased with her own money and situate in her own buildings. These goods could not in any way be said to be the goods of Weisner. In this statement of claim the sheriff seeks to justify the sale of these goods on the ground that in the order of Judge Robertson of August 22, all goods in the possession of the appellant had been declared to be the property of Weisner and, therefore, when he seized and sold them he was selling Weisner's goods.\n\"I find it difficult to believe that Judge Robertson intended to hold that all the stock-in-trade in the appellant's possession, no matter by whom it was in fact owned, was the property of Weisner. To reach that conclusion the judge would have to be satisfied that the business she was carrying on was the business of Weisner, or that the money with which she purchased the stock-in-trade was Weisner's money. The appellant has explained that she obtained the money to make payments on the stock-in-trade she purchased in 1928, by taking over, in 1927, trading supplies which Weisner had brought to Ingenika but which, through illness, he was unable to trade with the Indians. These supplies she took to the White Water Post under an agreement in writing with Weisner and traded them through the fall of 1927 and the winter of 1927-8, making a profit thereon. Neither in this action nor in the action before Judge Robertson has anyone challenged the bona fides of that transaction, or alleged that the profit which she obtained from such trading was not rightfully her money. In the case before Judge Robertson all the allegations in the statement of claim and all the evidence given at the trial (Exhibits in the present case), were directed against the bill of sale, and, in the examination of Weisner for discovery put in evidence by counsel for Strand, the questions impliedly admit that the goods taken north in 1928 were the property of the appellant. For example:\u2014\nQ. In the spring of 1928 did you buy considerable goods and get them to Summit Lake, for Mrs. Overn and take them out to Whitewater?\nA. Yes, sir.\n***\nQ. What weight of freight did you take up for Mrs. Overn in the spring of that year?\nA. All goods. I think there was 16 tons, might have a little over or under.\n\"The only statement before Judge Robertson which is apparently not consistent with the evidence that the money with which the goods were bought was the appellant's money, is that of Weisner who thought she made the original purchase in 1927 for her husband's business, which was that of trapping. The husband, however, said that \"Practically Mrs. Overn owns the business.\" In view of the allegations and the evidence it is, to my mind, hardly conceivable that Judge Robertson intended to make the sweeping declaration contained in the clause in question in his order, although no doubt the language used, if taken by itself apart from the context, is sufficiently wide to carry the construction sought to be put upon it. The clause to my mind should be construed in accordance with the well known maxim that general words may be aptly restrained to the subject matter with which the speaker or writer is dealing. Broom's Legal Maxims, page 415; Willes J., in Chorlton v. Lings[16]; Moore v. Rawlins[17]. Construing it thus the declaration would apply only to the contents of the bill of sale. If, however, the language of the clause be given its broad and literal meaning it still affords no protection to the sheriff for the declaration, as well as the rest of the order in which it is found, is, as I have already pointed out, a nullity having been made without jurisdiction and, as such, cannot support or justify anything purporting to be done under it. It is from the writ of execution and not from the judgment or order on which it is founded that the sheriff derives his protection. Moreover there is no evidence that the sheriff had any knowledge of the existence of the order. What he had was a letter from Strand asking him to instruct his deputy to seize all the goods and chattels of Weisner and the appellant, including the goods in the appellant's store. There was nothing in the writ of execution indicating that the goods in the possession of the appellant belonged to Weisner, so that in carrying out the instructions in Strand's letter the sheriff was not following the directions in the writ, but was acting as Strand's agent. The goods sold not being the property of Weisner he sheriff is equally liable with Srand for their conversion.\n\"It was also argued that as the sheriff was entitled to seize and sell the appellant's goods under the execution against her, the sale of all her goods was valid even if excessive because no claim had been expressly made for ex- cessive seizure. The claim that he had no right to seize or sell any of the appellant's goods is, in my opinion, sufficient to cover a claim for excessive seizure. The sheriff's duty was to sell sufficient of the appellant's goods to satisfy the execution against her. When he had done that she was entitled to immediate possession of the remainder.\n\"In Batchelor v. Vyse[18], it was held that:\nIf the sheriff sells under an execution more goods than are sufficient to satisfy the debt and costs he is liable in trover in respect of the excess.\nTo the same effect is the case of Stead et al v. Gascoigne[19], where Dallas C.J., with whom the other members of the court concurred, said:\u2014\nA sheriff has no right to sell more than is necessary: the defendant in this case has, in my opinion, committed a tortious act; and trover is the proper action.\n\"In the present case there was no occasion to sell the appellant's goods in bulk\u2014they consisted of groceries, dry goods, hardware and tobacco, and were, therefore, saleable in small packages.\n\"The defence of the respondents, the Hudson Bay Company, is that they were bona fide purchasers for value from the sheriff of goods sold by him under execution.\n\"A sale by a sheriff is not a sale in market overt and the purchaser acquires thereby only the interest in the goods which the sheriff has the right to sell. Unless, therefore, the goods sold are the goods of the execution debtor, the sheriff does not, by his writ, acquire any right to sell them and cannot transfer any right to a purchaser as against the real owner.\n\"The rights of a purchaser at a sale under execution were discussed by the Privy Council in Rewa Mahton v. Ram Kishen Singh[20], and it was pointed out that if the court issuing the execution had jurisdiction, a purchaser was not bound to inquire into the correctness of the order or judgment upon which the execution issued. A purchaser, therefore, at a sale under execution is under no obligation to go behind the writ, but, in order to make sure that he will acquire title to the goods he buys, he must see that the court issuing the writ had jurisdiction to do so; that the writ is regular on its face, and that the goods sold by the sheriff are the goods of the execution debtor.\n\"The writ for $497.25 against the appellant's goods, as I have already pointed out, fulfilled these requirements. The title to the goods sold to satisfy that writ, therefore, passed to these respondents and no action lies against them for their conversion. They, however, unfortunately for themselves, did not see that the remainder of the goods which they purchased were the goods of the execution debtor mentioned in the writ under which they were sold. And as they were not his goods these respondents obtained no title whatever to them and, having taken possession of them, must account to the appellant for their value. I am, therefore, of opinion that the respondents are liable for the loss suffered by the appellant, but I do not think each of the respondents is liable for the whole loss.\n\"For the reasons I have given, the respondents, Wilson & Wilson are responsible for the loss caused by the sale of the appellant's goods to satisfy the writ for $497.25; the other respondents are liable for the balance. The total damage suffered was $11,000; the amount of the two writs was $3,202.88. The liability of each respondent is, therefore, a matter of calculation. If the parties do not agree as to the amounts the matter may be referred to the Registrar for computation.\n\"The appeal will therefore be allowed as to all the respondents; the judgment below set aside, and the judgment of the trial judge restored but modified in the way I have indicated as to the amount for which each respondent is liable. The appellant is entitled to her costs throughout against all the defendants.\"\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nJ. A. MacInnes for the appellant.\nJ. W. de B.

Even if the contract provides that the work will be performed under the supervision of the city engineer, the contractor cannot complain of the fact that the engineers had not given him any instructions or advice as to the way the trenches should be cribbed, as he was at liberty to do such work in his own way without the permission of the engineer as long as the latter was not making any formal objection. Cannon J. contra.\nWhile articles 1200 and 1202 C.C. enact that, when the performance of an obligation to do has become impossible, the obligation is extinguished and both parties are liberated, in order that such a rule may be applied, it is not sufficient to establish that the performance would be extremely difficult, but it must be shown that it is absolutely impossible, i.e., that there exists an insurmountable obstacle which could not be foreseen.\nPer Cannon J. (dissenting): Articles 1062 and 1080 of the Civil Code apply to this case because the municipality, through its engineer, by electing a defective material and mode of construction, imposed conditions that were contrary to law and public order and vitiated the whole contract. The contractor was in duty bound to refuse to erect a defective construction which could certainly not last during the period of guarantee imposed by article 1688 of the Civil Code, which is \u201cd\u2019ordre public,\u201d and no one, under article 13 of the same code, can, possibly, by private agreement contravene the laws of public order. Per Cannon J. dissenting.\u2014The works contracted for were not susceptible of execution, inasmuch as the contractor was obliged by laws of public order to refuse to instal defective material, viz.: the short clay pipes specified in the contract, as long as the municipality did not specify in writing, as provided for in the contract and specifications, through its engineer, the manner of laying suitable foundation for them; consequently the appellant was right in refusing to continue and complete the works under such conditions that would inevitably endanger the solidity of the construction. Moreover the performance of the contract has been rendered impossible not- through any fault of the appellant, but through the act of the municipality in trying to force the appellant to execute the contract in contravention with laws of public order, the altered specifications, substituting short clay pipes to longer iron pipes, not having been approved by the Provincial Board of Health, such previous approbation being required by R.S.Q. 1925, c. 186, s. 57.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 48 \u041a\u0411. 374) aff., Cannon J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Kings\u2019 Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec (1), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Weir J.[1] and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action, allowing also the respondents cross-demand.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C., and E.

Il a institu\u00e9 son action dans le but d\u2019obtenir la r\u00e9siliation de son contrat pour cause d\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019ex\u00e9cuter. Le contrat pourvoyait au posage de tuyaux de gr\u00e8s. L\u2019appelant all\u00e8gue que, en cours d\u2019ex\u00e9cution, les travaux ont atteint un terrain \u201c sablonneux, mouvant et d\u00e9lay\u00e9 par l\u2019eau \u201c o\u00f9 le posage de tuyaux de gr\u00e8s \u00e9tait impossible. Il en a averti l\u2019intim\u00e9e; et, au moyen des proc\u00e9dures qui sont maintenant devant la cour, il demande que cette impossibilit\u00e9 soit constat\u00e9e et qu\u2019il soit, en cons\u00e9quence, relev\u00e9 de ses obligations. En outre, il conclut au remboursement de certains frais de mat\u00e9riaux et de transport et au paiement d\u2019une somme de six cents dollars ($600) pour prix et valeur de ses services.\n\u013dintim\u00e9e, au contraire, a ni\u00e9 l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019ex\u00e9cution. Elle a attribu\u00e9 les difficult\u00e9s rencontr\u00e9es par l\u2019appelant \u00e0 son d\u00e9faut d\u2019outillage, de mat\u00e9riaux et de main-d\u2019\u0153uvre, \u00e0 son inexp\u00e9rience et \u00e0 son incapacit\u00e9. Elle a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que, pour toutes ces causes, l\u2019appelant a d\u00fb abandonner les travaux et qu\u2019elle s\u2019est autoris\u00e9e d\u2019une des clauses du contrat pour les continuer aux risques et d\u00e9pens de l\u2019appelant. Elle a termin\u00e9 le syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9gouts. Il a co\u00fbt\u00e9 $7,726.79 en exc\u00e9dent du prix convenu dans le contrat. L\u2019intim\u00e9e reconna\u00eet qu\u2019une somme de $1,620.50 doit \u00eatre retranch\u00e9e de cet exc\u00e9dent pour le prix et la valeur de tuyaux, de sable et de bois ou de mat\u00e9riel non utilis\u00e9s qu\u2019elle a trouv\u00e9s sur les chantiers lorsqu\u2019elle a assum\u00e9 l\u2019entreprise. Il reste une balance de $6,106.29. Elle accepte d\u2019en d\u00e9duire la somme de $2,161.73 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant pour ses d\u00e9bours\u00e9s et frais de transport, mais elle refuse de reconna\u00eetre la somme de $600 pour valeur de services rendus. Elle conclut donc, par voie de demande reconventionnelle, \u00e0 ce que, toute compensation \u00e9tant \u00e9tablie, le demandeur-appelant soit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 lui payer une balance de $3,945.56.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu l\u2019action et rejet\u00e9 la demande reconventionnelle, mais la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi a, infirm\u00e9 ce jugement et a donn\u00e9 raison \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nL\u2019appelant nous soumet maintenant la cause et nous demande de r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\nL\u2019action s\u2019appuie sur les articles 1200 et suivants du code civil. En vertu de ces articles, lorsque l\u2019obligation de faire une chose est devenue impossible, cette obligation est \u00e9teinte et les deux parties sont lib\u00e9r\u00e9es (Arts. 1200 et 1202 C.C.);\nmais si l\u2019obligation a \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e en partie au profit du cr\u00e9ancier, ce dernier est oblig\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence du profit qu\u2019il en re\u00e7oit. (Art. 1202 C.C.).\nC\u2019est l\u2019adoption par la loi du principe: Impossibilium nulla obligatio. C\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs la cons\u00e9cration d\u2019une cons\u00e9quence in\u00e9vitable, car il est \u00e9vident qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019impossible nul ne peut \u00eatre tenu. Mais, pour que la r\u00e8gle re\u00e7oive son application, il faut que l\u2019on soit en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une v\u00e9ritable impossibilit\u00e9. La doctrine et la jurisprudence s\u2019accordent \u00e0 exiger une impossibilit\u00e9 absolue.\nIl ne suffit pas (dit Mourlon (no 1480)), que l\u2019ex\u00e9cution devienne difficile, il faut qu\u2019elle soit absolument impossible.\nOpposer l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019ex\u00e9cution, c\u2019est, en somme, plaider le cas fortuit ou la force majeure.\nLa ligne de d\u00e9marcation entre le cas fortu\u00eft et la force majeure n\u2019est pas toujours clairement indiqu\u00e9e. Le code civil emploie tant\u00f4t l\u2019un, tant\u00f4t l\u2019autre, et parfois il les r\u00e9unit tous les deux. Il d\u00e9finit l\u2019un par l\u2019autre. Il ne donne pas de d\u00e9finition de la force majeure; mais il dit du cas fortuit que\nc\u2019est un \u00e9v\u00e9nement impr\u00e9vu caus\u00e9 par une force majeure \u00e0 laquelle il est impossible de r\u00e9sister. Art. 17, par. 24 C.C.\nC\u2019est la doctrine m\u00eame du droit romain, et c\u2019est pratiquement le texte d\u2019Ulpien, qui d\u00e9crivait le cas fortuit: Un \u00e9v\u00e9nement que la prudence humaine ne peut pr\u00e9voir. Et c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire: Un \u00e9v\u00e9nement qui sort de la marche accoutum\u00e9e de la nature, un accident qui d\u00e9joue tous les calculs de la prudence humaine (5 Mignault, p. 671).\nQuant \u00e0 la force majeure, le paragraphe 24 de l\u2019article 17 du code civil en exprime suffisamment le sens, en la, qualifiant \u201cune force * * * \u00e0 laquelle il est impossible de r\u00e9sister\u201d (cui resisti non potest).\nPour obtenir la r\u00e9siliation d\u2019un contrat par suite de l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de son ex\u00e9cution, ce sont l\u00e0 les conditions qui doivent se rencontrer. Il faut un \u201c obstacle insurmontable \u201c, \u2018suivant l\u2019expression de Marcad\u00e9 (vol. 4, p. 382, sur articles 1302 et 1303 C.N.); car, dit Pothier (Obligations, n\u00ba 133), \u201clorsque la chose est possible en soi, l\u2019obligation ne laisse pas de subsister \u201c, quoiqu\u2019elle soit impossible \u00e0 un entrepreneur particulier; et, naturelement, c\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019entrepreneur qui demande la r\u00e9siliation du contrat qu\u2019il incombe de prouver l\u2019existence d\u2019une impossibilit\u00e9 de ce genre et d\u2019\u00e9tablir qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas pu la pr\u00e9voir. Le code le dit:\nLe d\u00e9biteur est tenu de prouver le cas fortuit qu\u2019il all\u00e8gue (Art. 1200 C.C.),\net Laurent ajoute (vol. 16, n\u00b0 255):\nC\u2019est le d\u00e9biteur qui est en faute de n\u2019avoir pas bien examin\u00e9, avant de s\u2019engager, s\u2019il \u00e9tait en son pouvoir d\u2019accomplir ce qu\u2019il promettait. Dans les circonstances, la Cour du Banc du Roi a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les faits de la cause sont loin d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 exig\u00e9e par la loi pour accorder la r\u00e9silia-, tion d\u2019un contrat. Nous dirions, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, que \u013eappdlant n\u2019a certainement pas apport\u00e9 de preuve suffisante que l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat \u00e9tait impossible, et, en cons\u00e9quence, pour justifier un tribunal de mettre ce contrat de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nLe terrain que l\u2019entrepreneur a rencontr\u00e9 au cours de ses travaux et dont il nous d\u00e9crit les difficult\u00e9s est le terrain que, en termes du m\u00e9tier, on est convenu d\u2019appeler \u201cquicksand\u201d. Par la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, on constate que c\u2019est l\u00e0 une condition qui \u201cse rencontre g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quand on pose des tuyaux d\u2019\u00e9gouts\u201d, et que celui du village de St-Joseph \u201c\u00e9tait de m\u00eame nature que tous les \u201cquicksand\u201d partout o\u00f9 on les rencontre\u201d.\nCe n\u2019\u00e9tait donc pas un \u201c \u00e9v\u00e9nement impr\u00e9vu\u201d. C\u2019\u00e9tait, au contraire, une condition \u00e0 laquelle tout entrepreneur exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 et comp\u00e9tent devait s\u2019attendre, \u2018surtout quand on songe que, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le cahier des charges l\u2019en avertissait express\u00e9ment.\nEn plus, ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une force \u201c\u00e0 laquelle il \u00e9tait impossible de r\u00e9sister\". Sur ce point, la preuve de l\u2019appelant est tout \u00e0 fait insuffisante. On y trouve m\u00eame des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui d\u00e9truisent sa pr\u00e9tention. Mais la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est convaincante. Elle d\u00e9montre que le contrat pouvait \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 suivant ses plans et devis, et que si l\u2019appelant a \u00e9chou\u00e9, il doit imputer soin \u00e9chec \u00e0 son d\u00e9faut de pr\u00e9paration, au manque de mat\u00e9riel ou d\u2019outillage et \u00e0 son incomp\u00e9tence dans la conduite des travaux. Comme le dit l\u2019un des t\u00e9moins: \u201cDans ce terrain-l\u00e0, il ne fallait pais l\u00e2cher.\u201d D\u00e8s que l\u2019appelant a atteint le \u201cquicksand\u201d, la mani\u00e8re de faire face \u00e0 la situation, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve, \u00e9tait de \u201ctravailler sans arr\u00eat\u201d. Dains un cas comme celui-l\u00e0, \u201cil ne faut pas laisser la tranch\u00e9e ouverte trop longtemps\u201d. Les \u00e9quipes doivent travailler\ncontinuellement, \u00e9quipe par \u00e9quipe; c\u2019est comme cela que ces travaux-l\u00e0 doivent se faire.\n* * *\nLe fond de la tranch\u00e9e \u00e9tait suffisamment bon pour porter le tuyau, pourvu que le jointement f\u00fbt bon et qu\u2019on ferme la tranch\u00e9e le plus t\u00f4t possible afin de ne pas donner de chance au \u201cquicksand\u201d de devenir bouillant. L\u2019appelant, probablement \u00e0 cause de son inexp\u00e9rience, laissa les tranch\u00e9es ouvertes du jour au lendemain. Il les abandonna m\u00eame le samedi \u00e0 trois heures de \u013eapres-midi pour ne les reprendre que le lundi matin, avec la cons\u00e9quence que, la tranch\u00e9e \u00e9tant rest\u00e9e ouverte, le fond devint ramolli et de nombreux \u00e9boulis se produisirent. En outre, \u013eappelant n\u2019avait pas le boisage voulu. Il fallait des pales-planches, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire un boisage jointe et embouvet\u00e9. Il n\u2019employa qu\u2019un boisage insuffisant. Pour r\u00e9ussir, suivant un mot du secr\u00e9taire-tr\u00e9sorier, l\u2019appelant \u201cn\u2019a pas su s\u2019y prendre\u201d. Plus il tentait de continuer avec ces moyens d\u00e9fectueux, plus la situation s\u2019aggravait; et le r\u00e9sultat fut, \u00e0 cause de ces fautes initiales dans lesquelles il persistait, que les travaux devinrent de plus en plus difficiles. L\u2019appelant avait lui-m\u00eame g\u00e2t\u00e9 une situation d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9licate et o\u00f9 des entrepreneurs de comp\u00e9tence et d\u2019exp\u00e9rience doivent man\u0153uvrer avec \u00e9nergie et avec rapidit\u00e9. C\u2019est \u00e0 son propre fait que l\u2019appelant doit attribuer l\u2019\u00e9chec qu\u2019il a subi; et il est assez remarquable de constater jusqu\u2019\u00e0 quel point la loi insiste pour d\u00e9cr\u00e9ter que l\u2019obligation doit \u00eatre devenue impossible \u201c sans le fait ou la faute du d\u00e9biteur \u201c, puisqu\u2019elle r\u00e9p\u00e8te cette condition dans chacun des articles 1200, 1201 et 1202 C.C.\nL\u2019appelant n\u2019a donc pu justifier de l\u2019existence d\u2019un \u00e9tat de choses qui entra\u00een\u00e2t la r\u00e9siliation de son contrat pour cause d\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019ex\u00e9cution; et, sur ce point, nous sommes absolument d\u2019accord avec l\u2019opinion de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi. Cette raison est suffisante pour confirmer le jugement.\nNotre conclusion n\u2019est pas \u00e9branl\u00e9e par le fait que, plus tard, lorsque la corporation municipale e\u00fbt assum\u00e9 l\u2019entreprise, comme le contrat le lui permettait, apr\u00e8s avoir pos\u00e9 des tuyaux de gr\u00e8s, elle dut les remplacer par des tuyaux d\u2019acier. Il est prouv\u00e9 que par sa manipulation d\u00e9fectueuse du terrain, et, par cons\u00e9quent, par son fait et par sa faute, l\u2019appelant avait rendu les conditions beaucoup moins praticables. De plus, les pluies exceptionnelles et extraordinaires qui se produisirent en 1927, apr\u00e8s que l\u2019appelant e\u00fbt ainsi aggrav\u00e9 la situation, apportent une explication plausible de la rupture subs\u00e9quente des tuyaux de gr\u00e8s pos\u00e9s par les contrema\u00eetres de la corporation qui ont succ\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant. Le contrat ne mettait pas l\u2019entrepreneur dans l\u2019\u00e9tat de subordination que ce dernier pr\u00e9tend. Comme la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi nous interpretons ce contrat dans le sens que l\u2019entrepreneur avait toute l\u2019initiative n\u00e9cessaire et qu\u2019il avait le droit d\u2019adopter de lui-m\u00eame les mesures requises pour faire face aux circonstances dans lesquelles il s\u2019est trouv\u00e9. L\u2019ing\u00e9nieur avait le pouvoir de \u201cconseiller et guider l\u2019ordonnance des travaux et la m\u00e9thode d\u2019ex\u00e9cution\u201d. En cas de conflit, la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur \u00e9tait finale. Mais l\u2019entrepreneur s\u2019\u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 envers la municipalit\u00e9 \u201c\u00e0 faire et parfaire\u201d tous les travaux et ouvrages \u201cpour la construction d\u2019un syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9gouts dans les limites de la municipalit\u00e9\u201d. A cet \u00e9gard, il fournissait \u201ctout appareil, outillage, toute l\u0430 machinerie, \u00e9quipement, etc., en un mot, tout ce qui est requis pour la construction et ex\u00e9cution parfaite des travaux\u201d. Il \u00e9tait seul responsable \u201cdu maintien des travaux ou constructions en cours d\u2019ex\u00e9cution\u201d. Il \u00e9tait sous la surveillance de l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur, mais cela ne l\u2019emp\u00eachait pas de d\u00e9cider luim\u00eame de quelle fa\u00e7on les travaux devaient \u00eatre conduits. Il pouvait les diriger \u00e0 sa guise tant que l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur n\u2019intervenait pas. Il n\u2019avait peut-\u00eatre pas le droit de les faire contrairement \u00e0 \u013eavis de l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur. Il ne pouvait passer outre \u00e0 sa d\u00e9fense. Mais il avait certainement le droit de prendre l\u2019initiative de tous les travaux accessoires requis sans en demander la permission \u00e0 l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur. En particulier, sur la question des pilotis ou des fondations qui auraient pu faciliter l\u2019ouvrage dans le \u201cquicksand\u201d, nous partageons l\u2019avis de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi que le contrat autorisait l\u2019entrepreneur \u00e0 les faire de lui-m\u00eame, s\u2019il les croyait opportuns ou utiles. Il pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur lui a dit qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas n\u00e9cessaires: il ne pr\u00e9tend nulle part que l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur lui aurait d\u00e9fendu de les faire.\nA tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, cette discussion entre l\u2019entrepreneur et l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur aurait pu donner lieu au moment o\u00f9 elle est suppos\u00e9e s\u2019\u00eatre produite\u2014et il est juste, sous ce rapport, de signaler que l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur ne l\u2019admet pas\u2014\u00e0 un prot\u00eat \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la corporation municipale; mais elle n\u2019\u00e9tablit certainement pas que l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du contrat \u00e9tait impossible en soi. Tout le monde admet qu\u2019eue \u00e9tait possible avec des pilotis et des fondations. Comme je l\u2019ai signal\u00e9 plus haut, au cours de l\u2019analyse de la preuve, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu\u2019un entrepreneur comp\u00e9tent, qui aurait abord\u00e9 le \u201c quicksand \u201c avec le mat\u00e9riel et les hommes voulus, en poursuivant les travaux contin\u00fbment, n\u2019e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de les accomplir m\u00eame sans fondation.\nIl reste que l\u2019appelant lui-m\u00eame, lorsqu\u2019il abandonna les travaux, ne l\u2019a pas fait parce qu\u2019il les pr\u00e9tendait impossibles. Il n\u2019a pas adopt\u00e9 cette position lors de sa comparution devant le conseil municipal, au mois de septembre 1926. A ce moment, il avait cess\u00e9 tout ouvrage depuis au del\u00e0 de six jours. Il ne vint pas demander d\u2019\u00eatre relev\u00e9 de ses obligations. Il d\u00e9clara, au contraire, que, si on lui fournissait de l\u2019argent, il continuerait le contrat. La corporation municipale \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9e de lui faire des avances d\u2019argent seulement au fur et \u00e0 mesure que le justifiaient les estim\u00e9s de l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur. D\u2019apr\u00e8s les estim\u00e9s qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7us jusque-l\u00e0, non seulement elle ne devait pas d\u2019argent \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, mais elle lui en avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 avanc\u00e9 plus qu\u2019elle n\u2019y \u00e9tait tenue.\nA cette s\u00e9ance du conseil, l\u2019appelant fit une d\u00e9claration que nous transcrivons d\u2019apr\u00e8s sa propre version:\nMonsieur le maire, si vous pensez qu\u2019un autre peut faire mieux que moi, essayez-le. Si \u00e7a va bien, j\u2019en b\u00e9n\u00e9ficierai pareil comme vous.\nCe n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u00e0 demander la r\u00e9siliation du contrat; c\u2019\u00e9tait, au contraire, en demander la continuation. En effet, la clause 29 du cahier des charges permettait \u00e0 la municipalit\u00e9 de pourvoir \u00e0 l\u2019ach\u00e8vement des travaux \u201caux frais, co\u00fbt et p\u00e9ril de l\u2019entrepreneur\u201d, si elle constatait\nque, par la faute de l\u2019entrepreneur, les travaux sont interrompus ou tram\u00e9s en longueur, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 donner des craintes fond\u00e9es sur leur ach\u00e8vement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque fix\u00e9e par le cahier des charges sp\u00e9ciales.\nA la suite de la d\u00e9claration de l\u2019appelant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e lui fit signifier un prot\u00eat o\u00f9 elle l\u2019avisa qu\u2019elle se pr\u00e9valait de cette clause du contrat. Elle y \u00e9tait invit\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant lui-m\u00eame; mais, en plus, il avait certainement abandonn\u00e9 les travaux \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, ou il donnait pour le moins des craintes fond\u00e9es qu\u2019il ne pourrait les terminer dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le contrat. L\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait donc dans les conditions voulues pour invoquer la clause 29.\nEt l\u2019appelant a indiscutablement accept\u00e9 cette situation. Il n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu au prot\u00eat de la corporation municipale. Cette derni\u00e8re a pris possession de l\u2019ouvrage sans protestation de sa part. Il a laiss\u00e9 faire les travaux jusqu\u2019\u00e0 leur parach\u00e8vement; et son attitude, dans ses lettres subs\u00e9quentes, le 17 janvier et le 4 novembre 1927, est strictement celle d\u2019un homme qui consid\u00e8re que le contrat a continu\u00e9 et que, suivant son expression, le \u201c conseil a pris les affaires pour finir les travaux\u201d.\nIl est douteux que, apr\u00e8s cet acquiescement, l\u2019appelant pouvait encore, le 21 avril 1928, pr\u00e8s de deux ans apr\u00e8s la s\u00e9ance du conseil dont nous avons parl\u00e9, instituer une action pour r\u00e9silier son contrat. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider ce point, puisque l\u2019on trouve dans le contrat lui-m\u00eame ce qui est suffisant pour justifier la prise de possession de la corporation municipale et puisque, en outre, l\u2019appelant doit \u00eatre quand m\u00eame d\u00e9bout\u00e9 des fins de son action parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il avait droit \u00e0 la r\u00e9siliation du contrat.\nIl s\u2019ensuit que le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9. L\u2019appelant n\u2019a pu \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une situation de fait qui permette, au point de vue l\u00e9gal, de d\u00e9clarer son obligation \u00e9teinte.\nComme cons\u00e9quence, il ne peut avoir droit \u00e0 la somme de six cents dollars ($600) pour la valeur de ses services, ou \u00e0 titre de quantum meruit. Le contrat n\u2019\u00e9tant pas mis de cet\u00e9, c\u2019est lui qui doit continuer de r\u00e9gir les relations des parties. Il ne pourvoit en aucune fa\u00e7on \u00e0 une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration du genre de celle que l\u2019appelant r\u00e9clame.\nQuant \u00e0 l\u2019item de $2,161.73 pour frais de transport et d\u00e9bours\u00e9s divers, l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne le conteste pas. Elle conclut simplement que la compensation en soit \u00e9tablie avec la r\u00e9clamation pour un montant sup\u00e9rieur qu\u2019elle fait dans sa demande reconventionnelle. L\u2019appelant a donc droit \u00e0 cet item; mais le tribunal a adjug\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps sur l\u2019action principale et sur la demande reconventionnelle; et, si cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e, il y avait lieu de d\u00e9clarer qu\u2019il y a compensation. (Art. 217 C.P.C.)\nNous ne sommes pas tout \u00e0 fait sans h\u00e9sitation quant \u00e0 l\u2019exactitude du compte qui fait la base de la demande reconventionelle. Le droit de l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019inclure dans le montant total d\u00fb la somme de $2,521.85 pour r\u00e9parations jusqu\u2019au 14 novembre 1927 n\u2019est pas absolument dair. Le contrat permet de charger des r\u00e9parations \u00e0 l\u2019entrepreneur; mais on aurait pu se demander si une partie de ces r\u00e9parations n\u2019est pas attribuable \u00e0 la malfa\u00e7on des contrema\u00eetres que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a employ\u00e9s pour succ\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019appelant. Cependant le compte a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi, et nous ne trouvons pas au dossier de quoi justifier une modification du jugement sur ce point.\nD\u2019autre part, vu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fini par remplacer les tuyaux de gr\u00e8s par des tuyaux d\u2019acier, l\u2019appelant pouvait pr\u00e9tendre que les travaux n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9s tells qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient pr\u00e9vus par le contrat, principalement en tenant compte de la d\u00e9claration de l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur qu\u2019il ne les a jamais accept\u00e9s. Mais nous devons supposer que ce point e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9clairci, si le demandeur lui-m\u00eame, dans sa d\u00e9claration, n\u2019avait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 en toutes lettres que la d\u00e9fenderesse avait compl\u00e9t\u00e9 les travaux le 14 novembre 1927, ce dont la corporation municipale, dans sa d\u00e9fense, a demand\u00e9 acte. Le fait de la completion des travaux et sa date se trouvent ainsi fix\u00e9s de consentement mutuel, et pour les fins de cette cause, cela doit nous lier.\nNous devons donc confirmer le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi avec d\u00e9pens.\nCannon J. (dissenting).\u2014L\u2019appelant a poursuivi l\u2019intim\u00e9e en r\u00e9siliation d\u2019un contrat pour la construction d\u2019\u00e9gouts et en r\u00e9clamation d\u2019un montant de $2,761.73, dont $2,161.73 pour d\u00e9bours\u00e9s faits et $600 pour salaire, ou prix de services rendus en ex\u00e9cution partielle de ce contrat. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a contest\u00e9 l\u2019action principale; et, par demande reconventionnelle, a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant un montant de $7,726. Les moyens invoqu\u00e9s de part et d\u2019autre sur la demande principale et sur la demande reconventionnelle sont pratiquement les m\u00eames.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure du district de Richelieu a maintenu l\u2019action de l\u2019appelant et rejet\u00e9 la demande reconventionnelle de l\u2019intim\u00e9e par jugement du 29 juin 1929.\nPar un arr\u00eat du 14 janvier 1930, la Cour du Banc du Roi a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019action avec d\u00e9pens et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 bien fond\u00e9e la demande reconventionnelle jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de $3, 945.56. L\u2019Honorable juge Tellier a enregistr\u00e9 sa dissidence.\nLe 29 juillet 1926, l\u2019administration municipale du village de St-Joseph de Sorel, par contrat notari\u00e9, engagea les services de l\u2019appelant pour la construction d\u2019un syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9gouts pour le prix de $32,811. Le montant de la soumission de \u013eapp\u00e9lant \u00e9tait plus \u00e9lev\u00e9; mais l\u2019intim\u00e9e ayant d\u00e9cid\u00e9, pour des raisons d\u2019\u00e9conomie, de retrancher une partie des travaux aux devis et de remplacer, dans une section de la rue Montcalm qui nous int\u00e9resse sp\u00e9cialement, des tuyaux d\u2019acier par des tuyaux de gr\u00e8s, le prix stipul\u00e9 fut fix\u00e9 au montant susdit. Ces changements ne semblent pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis au Service Provincial d\u2019Hygi\u00e8ne, qui avait approuv\u00e9 les plans et devis originaires le 14 juillet 1926, quinze jours auparavant. On semble donc, d\u00e8s l\u2019origine, avoir enfreint une disposition d\u2019ordre public, 12 Geo. V, c. 29, s. 55 (S.R.Q. 1925, c. 186, s. 57), ce qui astreignait, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, l\u2019entrepreneur \u00e0 modifier ou d\u00e9molir les travaux faits sans autorisation pr\u00e9alable, outre la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 encourue pour l\u2019infraction \u00e0 la loi.\nL\u2019appelant expose que vers le 11 ao\u00fbt 1926, apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre procur\u00e9 les mat\u00e9riaux sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s, il commen\u00e7a les travaux et posa les tuyaux sur une longueur d\u2019environ 800 pieds, sur la rue Montcalm, \u00e0 la satisfaction de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un surveillant et des ing\u00e9nieurs. L\u2019appelant rencontra alors un terrain sablonneux et \u201csourceux\u201d (\u201cquicksand\u201d) o\u00f9 les tuyaux de gr\u00e8s, ne pouvant \u00eatre pos\u00e9s sur un fond solide, se disjoignaient ou se brisaient au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient mis en place. L\u2019appelant pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019il devint \u00e9vident que, malgr\u00e9 ses efforts, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas possible de faire un bon travail en suivant les plans et devis tels que pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par MM. Roy et Toupin, les ing\u00e9nieurs de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Ces derniers ne firent rien pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 ces difficult\u00e9s, comme ils en avaient le pouvoir, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les clauses suivantes du cahier des charges partie du contrat:\n8\u00b0 L\u2019entrepreneur sera tenu, au moyen de calculs et d\u2019\u00e9tudes des documents concernant l\u2019entreprise, de s\u2019assurer par lui-m\u00eame de l\u2019\u00e9tendue des obligations que le cahier des charges lui impose et il devra visiter et examiner les endroits o\u00f9 les travaux doivent \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s. Il sera cens\u00e9 avoir examin\u00e9 tous les documents et les avoir trouv\u00e9s exacts, et les avoir trouv\u00e9s en concordance les uns avec les autres. L\u2019entrepreneur ne pourra sous aucun pr\u00e9texte, \u00e9lever aucune r\u00e9clamation du chef d\u2019erreurs ou omissions qui existeraient dans les dits documents, car des instructions d\u00e9taill\u00e9es seront fournies chaque fois qu\u2019une erreur ou une omission de ce genre sera d\u00e9couverte, et l\u2019entrepreneur ex\u00e9cutera ces ouvrages comme \u00e9tant partie int\u00e9grale de l\u2019ouvrage complet.\nLa d\u00e9cision de l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur sera finale et sans appel et la correction qu\u2019il fera des plans ou des devis fera partie du contrat.\n9\u00b0 La construction, l\u2019installation et l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux devront se faire conform\u00e9ment aux avis, soumissions, cahiers des charges g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et sp\u00e9ciaux, plans et dessins qui pourront \u00eatre fournis en m\u00eame temps que les formules de .soumissions, ou suivant les instructions d\u00e9taill\u00e9es qui seront fournies au cours des travaux.\n13\u00b0 L\u2019entrepreneur ne devra commencer aucun ouvrage ou faire aucune modification aux dits ouvrages avant d\u2019avoir re\u00e7u un ordre \u00e9crit de l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur. Apr\u00e8s la signature du contrat, l\u2019entrepreneur devra commencer les travaux au jour fix\u00e9 par l\u2019ordre \u00e9crit de l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur et les dits travaux devront \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s sans interruption avec les plus grande diligence \u00e0 moins que l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur n\u2019autorise le contraire par \u00e9crit.\nEn aucun cas l\u2019entrepreneur ne pourra r\u00e9clamer sur des ordres verbaux.\nL\u2019ing\u00e9nieur aura toute autorit\u00e9 et qualit\u00e9 pour conseiller et guider l\u2019ordonnance des travaux et la m\u00e9thode d\u2019ex\u00e9cution et sa d\u00e9cision sera finale. * * *\n16\u00b0 L\u00e0 o\u00f9 l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur l\u2019exigera, l\u2019entrepreneur placera \u00e0 ses frais et d\u00e9pens dans le fond de la tranch\u00e9e, une planche de 1\u201d d\u2019\u00e9paisseur, et de largeur suffisante pour recevoir l\u2019\u00e9gout.\nDans tous les endroits mous, l\u2019entrepreneur devra \u00e0 ses frais et d\u00e9pens, sur avis de l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur, construire au fond de la tranch\u00e9e un pav\u00e9 dont les dimensions seront alors fournies par l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur et qui de toutes mani\u00e8res devra \u00eatre suffisant pour emp\u00eacher l\u2019\u00e9gout d\u2019enfoncer sous la pesanteur du remplissage.\nL\u2019entrepreneur est averti qu\u2019il peut se rencontrer de ces endroits mous, bien que aucun puits n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par la municipalit\u00e9 afin de conna\u00eetre le sous-sol. C\u2019est donc \u00e0 l\u2019entrepreneur \u00e0 se rendre compte par lui-m\u00eame de la nature du terrain.\n21\u00b0 S\u2019il y a lieu de faire usage de pilotis l\u2019entrepreneur suivra les avis de l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur. Dans ce cas les devis de l\u2019American Society of Municipal Improvements seront suivis.\nL\u2019appelant nous dit, en outre, que ses employ\u00e9s, d\u00e9courag\u00e9s, et attir\u00e9s par la campagne \u00e9lectorale qui battait alors son plein, quitt\u00e8rent de chantier. De son cot\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e, par son prot\u00eat notari\u00e9 du 20 septembre 1926, somme l\u2019appelant d\u2019abandonner les travaux, qu\u2019elle se charge de continuer elle-m\u00eame. Les contrema\u00eetres qui se sont succ\u00e9d\u00e9s apr\u00e8s l\u2019appelant et que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a choisis pour continuer les travaux n\u2019ont pu ex\u00e9cuter les plans et devis. Ils ont \u00e9chou\u00e9 en particulier \u00e0 l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9 d\u2019abandonner son travail.\nPendant le cours des travaux, l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9bours\u00e9 pour l\u2019avantage et le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la somme de $2,161.73, repr\u00e9sentant des frais de transport des mat\u00e9riaux que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a re\u00e7us et accept\u00e9s, pay\u00e9s et employ\u00e9s.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance a accept\u00e9 les pr\u00e9tentions de l\u2019appelant. Il a fait un expos\u00e9 complet de tous les faits de la cause, une \u00e9tude d\u00e9taill\u00e9e du contrat, des plan et sp\u00e9cifications qui r\u00e9gissent les rapports juridiques des parties. Je crois utile de reproduire, en partie, les conclusions du savant juge: Il appert par la preuve que les travaux se faisaient en la pr\u00e9sence et sous le contr\u00f4le de l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur qui donnait les niveaux, et les tuyaux n\u2019\u00e9taient enterr\u00e9s qu\u2019apr\u00e8s son inspection et son consentement; que dans le terrain solide, le travail avan\u00e7ait rapidement, \u00e0 la satisfaction de l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur et que les troubles ont commenc\u00e9 avec le terrain sourceux o\u00f9 les ouvriers ne parvenaient pas \u00e0 faire tenir les tuyaux trop courts pour cette sorte de terrain; qu\u2019\u00e0 ce point, le demandeur et son contrema\u00eetre repr\u00e9sent\u00e8rent \u00e0 l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur qu\u2019il faudrait solidifier le fond de la tranch\u00e9e; l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur a refus\u00e9 son consentement et a ordonn\u00e9 de continuer les travaux, ce que le demandeur a essay\u00e9 de faire, sans succ\u00e8s; que dans ces circonstances, les employ\u00e9s du demandeur se sont d\u00e9courag\u00e9s et ont quitt\u00e9 le chantier, sans permission, et que m\u00eame, le t\u00e9moin Valois, le principal assistant du demandeur, homme d\u2019exp\u00e9rience et de capacit\u00e9, s\u2019est d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 laisser sa position, convaincu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait inutile de continuer le travail sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur de la d\u00e9fenderesse et cette difficult\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi \u00e0 la connaissance de l\u2019inspecteur Lanciault, nomm\u00e9 par la d\u00e9fenderesse et qui, examin\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin, d\u00e9pose que sous les circonstances, il \u00e9tait impossible de faire mieux que le demandeur;\nQue d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins ont exprim\u00e9 l\u2019opinion qu\u2019il aurait fallu poser des tuyaux plus longs et faire une fondation solide dans le fond de la tranch\u00e9e, ce qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 par les ing\u00e9nieurs de la d\u00e9fenderesse;\nQue l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur Roy d\u00e9pose, qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli de fondation, qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9tudi\u00e9 le genre de fondation qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre fait, mais qu\u2019il a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 au t\u00e9moin Valois de faire un radier en planches, mais n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 d\u2019ordre \u00e0 cet effet; que dans tous les cas, le dit ing\u00e9nieur ajoute qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de finir les travaux pour le quinze octobre, en faisant une bonne fondation, quoique le demandeur aurait pu finir une bonne partie de son travail;\nQue l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur Toupin d\u00e9pose que le demandeur a fait preuve de bonne foi et qu\u2019il a fait son possible; que sous les circonstances, il n\u2019aurait pas fait de reproches \u00e0 l\u2019entrepreneur s\u2019il n\u2019eut pas fini ses travaux pour le quinze octobre, il est d\u2019opinion qu\u2019il aurait fallu une fondation de pilotis, mais qu\u2019il ne l\u2019a pas conseill\u00e9 au demandeur parce qu\u2019il ne voulait pas prendre de responsabilit\u00e9;\nQue les contrema\u00eetres engag\u00e9s par la d\u00e9fenderesse apr\u00e8s le quinze octobre, pour finir les travaux, ont toujours travaill\u00e9 sous la surveillance et le contr\u00f4le des m\u00eames ing\u00e9nieurs jusqu\u2019au quatorze novembre 1927, et ont quitt\u00e9 les lieux l\u2019un apr\u00e8s l\u2019autre;\nQue la d\u00e9fenderesse a finalement abandonn\u00e9 les devis des ing\u00e9nieurs et a fait les travaux \u00e0 sa fa\u00e7on, changeant selon qu\u2019elle le jugeait \u00e0 propos, les tuyaux de gr\u00e8s par des tuyaux d\u2019acier; que des t\u00e9moins sont venus d\u00e9poser que les devis \u00e9taient impossibles \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter, et, en effet, n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s; que le contrema\u00eetre de la d\u00e9fenderesse, un nomm\u00e9 Tapp, qui a succ\u00e9d\u00e9 au demandeur dans les dits travaux, a suivi les devis et trois fois, le travail s\u2019est d\u00e9fait. Il a travaill\u00e9 ainsi pendant l\u2019automne de 1926 et au printemps de 1927, lorsque la d\u00e9fenderesse \u013ea remplac\u00e9 par d\u2019autres contrema\u00eetres, savoir: MM. Gallien, Leclerc et Lafreni\u00e8re, en succession;\nQu\u2019apr\u00e8s le quatorze novembre 1927, les ing\u00e9nieurs ne sont pas revenus sur les lieux.

La question \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre est celle-ci: l\u2019appelant a-t-il eu raison d\u2019abandonner le travail qu\u2019on persistait \u00e0 lui faire ex\u00e9cuter dans des conditions qui rendaient impossible la solidit\u00e9 de l\u2019ouvrage? En d\u2019autres termes, dans les circonstances r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9es au dossier, l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait-il justifiable, vu le refus de l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur d\u2019ordonner une fondation convenable, ou de changer les mat\u00e9riaux, d\u2019avertir les autorit\u00e9s municipales de l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 pratique de placer solidement dans le sol mouvant d\u00e9couvert sur la rue Montcalm des tuyaux courts de gr\u00e8s que, pour raison d\u2019\u00e9conomie, on avait substitu\u00e9s aux conduites plus longues de fer ou d\u2019acier?\nEt d\u2019abord, qui est responsable du vice du sol?\nD\u2019apr\u00e8s moi, la question de vice du sol se pr\u00e9sente sous un angle diff\u00e9rent lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit, comme dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, non pas de la construction d\u2019un \u00e9difice sur le terrain d\u2019un particulier, mais de l\u2019installation d\u2019un syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9gouts dans les rues d\u2019une municipalit\u00e9. L\u2019entrepreneur, vis-\u00e0-vis de la municipalit\u00e9, est dans une position essentiellement subordonn\u00e9e; le choix de l\u2019emplacement est toujours d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par d\u00e9cision de l\u2019administration qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas en son pouvoir de faire modifier. La municipalit\u00e9 doit obtenir d\u2019abord l\u2019approbation du plan et du terrain par les autorit\u00e9s provinciales. Le constructeur n\u2019a d\u00e8s lors aucun choix ou aucune discr\u00e9tion \u00e0 exercer et ne peut d\u2019avance avertir le propri\u00e9taire des dangers possibles r\u00e9sultant de la nature du terrain. M\u00eame si l\u2019on avait fait des sondages pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 cet endroit de la rue Montcalm, le trac\u00e9 n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9, car les \u00e9gouts devaient n\u00e9cessairement passer \u00e0 cet endroit ind\u00e9pendamment de la nature du sous-sol de la rue; et c\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur et au conseil de donner les instructions voulues pour y faire les fondations requises s\u2019il \u00e9tait possible d\u2019utiliser dans ce terrain des tuyaux de gr\u00e8s; et, si l\u2019on avait voulu, comme on l\u2019a fait \u00e9ventuellement, mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 les devis, et substituer le fer au gr\u00e8s, l\u2019appelant, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le contrat, avait le droit d\u2019exiger une sp\u00e9cification suppl\u00e9mentaire \u00e9crite et un ordre d\u2019un ing\u00e9nieur. Ce dernier a toujours refus\u00e9 de faire le moindre changement \u00e0 ses sp\u00e9cifications, n\u2019a pas voulu y ajouter; et ce n\u2019est que lors de l\u2019enqu\u00eate qu\u2019il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de faire une fondation en bois ou sur pilotis pour asseoir les tuyaux \u00e0 cet endroit.\nIl est clair, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve, qu\u2019\u00e0 moins d\u2019une fondation sp\u00e9ciale, il \u00e9tait impossible de faire tenir en place les con-, duites, trop courtes, en gr\u00e8s que la municipalit\u00e9, sur l\u2019avis de son ing\u00e9nieur, avait choisies comme mat\u00e9riaux, et ce dernier, par une \u00e9trange aberration, a refus\u00e9 d\u2019ordonner aucun des travaux et des mesures propices pour asseoir solidement ces tuyaux, bien qu\u2019il admette dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il aurait fallu une fondation mais qu\u2019il \u201c n\u2019a pas \u00e9tudi\u00e9 le genre de fondation qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre fait\u201d!\nComme le dit Sourdat, \u201cDe la responsabilit\u00e9\u201d, paragraphe n\u00b0 673,\nlorsque l\u2019entrepreneur n\u2019est qu\u2019un simple artisan, travaillant d\u2019apr\u00e8s les plans et sous les ordres d\u2019un propri\u00e9taire ou de son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9, on est r\u00e9ellement en dehors des pr\u00e9visions de la loi, et les rapports du constructeur avec le ma\u00eetre sont ceux de l\u2019entrepreneur ou du t\u00e2cheron avec l\u2019architecte auquel il est subordonn\u00e9, l\u2019un r\u00e9pondant seulement de la main-d\u2019\u0153uvre, l\u2019autre des plans et de l\u2019observation des r\u00e8gles de \u013eart.\nLe Conseil d\u2019Etat, le 2 avril 1886, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019un entrepreneur avait le devoir d\u2019\u00e9clairer en temps utile l\u2019administration communale sur les d\u00e9fectuositi\u00e9s des mat\u00e9riaux et l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de faire avec ces mat\u00e9riaux un travail utile et convenable. Sirey, 1888-3-4.\nIl faut d\u00e9cider, comme le premier juge, que le contrat doit \u00eatre mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 parce que l\u2019ouvrage n\u2019\u00e9tait pas, \u00e0 cet endroit de la rue Montcalm, susceptible d\u2019ex\u00e9cution, vu que l\u2019on voulait forcer l\u2019appelant \u00e0 installer des tuyaux trop courts dans du sable mouvant, sans ordonner la fondation n\u00e9cessaire.\nFr\u00e9my-Ligneville, dans son \u201cTrait\u00e9 de la l\u00e9gislation des b\u00e2timents\u201d, 3e \u00e9dition, nous dit:\n75. Lorsque la perte des ouvrages arrive par le vice intrins\u00e8que des mat\u00e9riaux fournis par l\u2019entrepreneur, il y a de la part de celui-ci une faute dont il supporte enti\u00e8rement les r\u00e9sultats. * * * Toutefois, si le vice des mat\u00e9riaux fournis par le propri\u00e9taire \u00e9tait manifeste et que l\u2019entrepreneur ait pu s\u2019en apercevoir, il doit perdre le prix de son travail et la valeur des mat\u00e9riaux, qu\u2019il devait se refuser \u00e0 employer; et cela lors m\u00eame qu\u2019il aurait pr\u00e9venu le propri\u00e9taire et que celui-ci aurait persist\u00e9 \u00e0 vouloir employer ces mauvais mat\u00e9riaux. L\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public exige qu\u2019on ne fasse pas de constructions vicieuses; l\u2019entrepreneur ne doit pas c\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019imprudence du propri\u00e9taire et faire sciemment une construction dont la perte est probable, et dont la chute peut compromettre la s\u00fbret\u00e9 publique (Troplong, no 985; Divergier, no 342; Guillouard, t. 2, no 790).\nA plus forte raison, l\u2019entrepreneur supporterait la totalit\u00e9 de la perte avant la livraison, si elle arrivait par un vice de construction. On appliquerait ici toutes les r\u00e8gles de la responsabilit\u00e9 des constructeurs pour vice de construction.\n131. Lorsque le sol est tellement mauvais que toute consolidation est inex\u00e9cutable, le march\u00e9 de construction, soit \u00e0 forfait, soit par s\u00e9rie de prix, doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant pour objet une chose impossible. L\u2019entrepreneur et le propri\u00e9taire ont tous deux le droit d\u2019en faire prononcer la nullit\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019art. 1133 du C. civ. (1062 C.C.).\nDans ce cas, si le propri\u00e9taire a fourni le sol, il doit payer \u00e0 l\u2019entrepreneur le prix des travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce jour. Il ne saurait, pas plus que l\u2019architecte, lui opposer que la d\u00e9couverte du mauvais sol est un cas de force majeure, qui doit lui faire perdre la valeur de ses travaux. Comme nous l\u2019avons dit, la force majeure ne produit cet effet que lorsqu\u2019elle d\u00e9truit les ouvrages. Quand les travaux ne sont qu\u2019arr\u00eat\u00e9s par un vice de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, le propri\u00e9taire supporte les cons\u00e9quences du mauvais \u00e9tat de sa chose et la perte des travaux qu\u2019il occasionne.\n938. Lorsque les vices de construction peuvent int\u00e9resser la solidit\u00e9 d\u2019un b\u00e2timent, il est du devoir de l\u2019architecte et de l\u2019entrepreneur d\u2019\u00e9clairer le propri\u00e9taire, et m\u00eame de refuser de construire dans les conditions indiqu\u00e9es par lui.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e nous dit que, malgr\u00e9 le refus des ing\u00e9nieurs Roy et Toupin de donner les ordres voulue pour la construction d\u2019une fondation en bois ou sur pilotis pour asseoir les tuyaux, \u013eappelant aurait d\u00fb, de lui-m\u00eame, faire ces travaux.\nComme je Fai d\u00e9j\u00e0 expos\u00e9, le contrat le liait absolument et l\u2019obligeait \u00e0 attendre les instructions \u00e9crites de l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur. Sur ce point, je citerai Lepage, \u201cLoi des b\u00e2timents\u201d, vol. 2, p. 39:\nLorsqu\u2019un architecte est charg\u00e9 de diriger les travaux confi\u00e9s \u00e0 un entrepreneur, le contrat de louage consenti par celui-ci porte pour condition, au moins tacite, qu\u2019il suivra les ordres de l\u2019architecte, afin que la construction soit ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e fid\u00e8lement, comme elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 projet\u00e9e. La premi\u00e8re attention de l\u2019entrepreneur est donc de se conformer en tous points aux plans et devis que lui donne l\u2019architecte. S\u2019il est quelque objet qui ne soit pas suffisamment figur\u00e9 sur les plans, ni d\u00e9crit assez clairement dans les devis, l\u2019entrepreneur doit avoir la pr\u00e9caution de se faire donner par \u00e9crit, les d\u00e9tails qui lui manquent et auxquels l\u2019architecte est tenu de suppl\u00e9er. Pareillement, si quelques changements sont arr\u00eat\u00e9s entre le propri\u00e9taire et l\u2019architecte, pendant la construction, la s\u00fbret\u00e9 de l\u2019entrepreneur exige qu\u2019il ne s\u2019occupe pas de ces changements, tant qu\u2019il n\u2019en a pas re\u00e7u l\u2019ordre par \u00e9crit, c\u2019est le plus s\u00fbr moyen d\u2019\u00e9viter toute, responsabilit\u00e9 pour raison de changements. Pp. 49 & 50:\nAu reste, l\u2019obligation d\u2019employer de bons mat\u00e9riaux n\u2019est pas impos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019entrepreneur seulement lorsqu\u2019il les fournit, nous pensons que, m\u00eame quand il en trouve chez le propri\u00e9taire, ou quand celui-ci en ach\u00e8te ailleurs, il n\u2019est permis \u00e0 l\u2019entrepreneur de faire entrer dans la construction que ceux qui sont de nature \u00e0 produire un ouvrage solide. Lorsque apr\u00e8s avoir choisi des mat\u00e9riaux qu\u2019il croit convenables, il s\u2019aper\u00e7oit en les travaillant qu\u2019il leur manque les qualit\u00e9s qu\u2019il leur avait suppos\u00e9es, il est de son devoir de les rebuter. Il manquerait \u00e0 la confiance de propri\u00e9taire s\u2019il ne l\u2019avertissait pas du danger qu\u2019il y aurait \u00e0 employer de pareilles mati\u00e8res. Nous disons plus: l\u2019entrepreneur qui userait de n\u00e9gligence ou d\u2019une complaisance coupable dans une circonstance aussi essentielle, serait responsable des vices de solidit\u00e9 qui pourraient en r\u00e9sulter.\nEn effet, lorsqu\u2019on d\u00e9signe \u00e0 un entrepreneur certains mat\u00e9riaux, c\u2019est toujours sous la condition tacite qu\u2019il les trouvera propres \u00e0 l\u2019objet qu\u2019il faut construire. Si donc ils sont d\u00e9fectueux, il ne doit pas en faire usage, sinon il serait garant des vices de construction que cet emploi de mauvaise mati\u00e8re aurait occasionn\u00e9s. L\u2019industrie que loue l\u2019entrepreneur, et sur laquelle a droit de compter le propri\u00e9taire, consiste non-seulement dans la mani\u00e8re de construire suivant les m\u00e9thodes approuv\u00e9es par les r\u00e8gles de l\u2019art; mais encore dans le choix des mati\u00e8res qu\u2019il met en \u0153uvre, soit qu\u2019il les fournisse lui-m\u00eame, soit qu\u2019on les lui procure.\nRemarquez que, si l\u2019objet \u00e9tait important, s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une . construction dont les vices pussent donner lieu \u00e0 des inconv\u00e9nients graves, l\u2019entrepreneur manquerait \u00e0 son devoir en faisant usage de mat\u00e9riaux qui porteraient atteinte \u00e0 la solidit\u00e9 de l\u2019ouvrage: sur ce point, l\u2019ordre du propri\u00e9taire ne doit pas \u00eatre \u00e9cout\u00e9; un entrepreneur honn\u00eate pr\u00e9f\u00e9rerait abandonner les travaux. D\u2019ailleurs, outre qu\u2019il ne convient pas, s\u2019il est jaloux de sa r\u00e9putation, de seconder des projets absurdes, c\u2019est qu\u2019il est express\u00e9ment d\u00e9fendu par les lois de police de faire aucune construction qui pourrait compromettre la s\u00fbret\u00e9 publique par une solidit\u00e9 insuffisante.\nIl semble que ces passages d\u2019un auteur r\u00e9put\u00e9 aient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crits sp\u00e9cialement pour l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qui nous est soumise.\nVoir Dalloz, Jurisprudence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, (Dubois c. Br\u00e9mond[2]).\nLa responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019architecte ou de l\u2019entrepreneur reste engag\u00e9e dans les conditions de l\u2019art. 1792 c. civ., alors m\u00eame qu\u2019il n\u2019a fait que suivre les ordres du propri\u00e9taire pour le mode de construction et l\u2019emploi des mat\u00e9riaux, le devoir de l\u2019homme de \u013eart \u00e9tant de refuser les travaux qui lui sont propos\u00e9s, quand ils doivent \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 compromettre leur solidit\u00e9 (c. civ. 1792).2\n(1) La pens\u00e9e qui a depuis longtemps pr\u00e9valu dans la jurisprudence des cours d\u2019appel et de la cour de cessation, c\u2019est que l\u2019architecte ou l\u2019entrepreneur a le devoir \u00e9troit, en raison de ses connaissances sp\u00e9ciales et des obligations particuli\u00e8res qu\u2019elles lui cr\u00e9ent, de r\u00e9sister au propri\u00e9taire, quand celui-ci veut lui imposer un mode de construction vicieux ou des mat\u00e9riaux d\u00e9fectueux. Il doit refuser les travaux qu\u2019on lui propose, plut\u00f4t que de les \u00e9tablir dans des conditions o\u00f9 leur solidit\u00e9 ne serait pas assur\u00e9e; et il est en faute s\u2019il c\u00e8de \u00e0 la pression du propri\u00e9taire.\nL\u2019\u00e9tude de la preuve m\u2019a convaincu qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu de changer les constatations faites par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance; et j\u2019adopte les conclusions tr\u00e8s bien assises de l\u2019honorable juge Tellier. Vu la n\u00e9gligence de l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur de donner les ordres requis pour continuer convenablement les travaux d\u2019installation des tuyaux de gr\u00e8s, il \u00e9tait devenu impossible pour le demandeur de compl\u00e9ter son ouvrage avant le 15 octobre 1926 sans engager sa responsabilit\u00e9 en ex\u00e9cutant un ouvrage vou\u00e9 \u00e0 la ruine. Il a donc eu raison de refuser de continuer une construction vicieuse.\nIl ne s\u2019agit pas ici de cas fortuit ni de force majeure, mais de l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de compl\u00e9ter le contrat dans le d\u00e9lai stipul\u00e9, avec la solidit\u00e9 voulue pour mettre l\u2019entrepreneur \u00e0 l\u2019abris de tout recours \u00e0 la suite de la ruine certaine de l\u2019\u00e9difice que l\u2019on voulait lui faire construire avec des mat\u00e9riaux d\u00e9fectueux et de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 en compromettre la solidit\u00e9. C\u2019est une impossibilit\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant, non pas d\u2019un cas fortuit ou d\u2019une force majeure, mais des termes m\u00eames du contrat; on a mis l\u2019appelant dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de construire, comme le veut la loi, assez solidement pour satisfaire \u00e0 la garantie de dix ans que, pour des raisons d\u2019ordre public, le code lui impose, et l\u2019intim\u00e9e, par son ing\u00e9nieur, a cr\u00e9\u00e9 cette situation qui a forc\u00e9 l\u2019entrepreneur \u00e0 refuser de continuer une construction vou\u00e9e d\u2019avance \u00e0 la ruine. L\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019objet du contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue impossible, au sens de l\u2019article 1062 du code civil, par le refus ou la n\u00e9gligence de l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur de compl\u00e9ter ses sp\u00e9cifications en donnant par \u00e9crit les ordres voulus pour permettre \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de faire ses travaux et de se servir avec s\u00fbret\u00e9 des mat\u00e9riaux de gr\u00e8s sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9s. En pareil cas, l\u2019objet de l\u2019obligation devenait prohib\u00e9 par une loi d\u2019ordre public. Il \u00e9tait du devoir de l\u2019appelant de ne pas assumer la responsabilit\u00e9 de la solidit\u00e9 de l\u2019ouvrage dans ces conditions. Comme le disait le juge-en-chef Archambault, dans La Corporation de Warwick v. Gagnon[3],\nCette responsabilit\u00e9 est d\u2019ordre public, et existe, m\u00eame si c\u2019est le propri\u00e9taire qui fournit lui-m\u00eame les mat\u00e9riaux. Le devoir de l\u2019entrepreneur est de refuser, dans ce cas, de mauvais mat\u00e9riaux.\nA pilus forte raison, pour d\u00e9gager sa responsabilit\u00e9, doit-il refuser de fournir lui-m\u00eame des mat\u00e9riaux d\u00e9fectueux et inutilisables pour une construction solide. La solidit\u00e9 des constructions est d\u2019ordre public et l\u2019article 13 du code civil d\u00e9fend de d\u00e9roger par des conventions particuli\u00e8res aux lois qui int\u00e9ressent l\u2019ordre public.\n7 Mignault, p, 407:\nMaintenant il faut voir dans l\u2019article 1688 une disposition d\u2019ordre public, car la solidit\u00e9 des \u00e9difices int\u00e9resse non seulement le propri\u00e9taire, mais le public tout entier. Il s\u2019ensuit que * * * Vordre m\u00eame du propri\u00e9taire d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter les travaux de telle ou telle fa\u00e7on, pas plus que sa pr\u00e9sence sur les lieux et son consentement, ne saurait constituer une excuse, car le devoir commande \u00e0 l\u2019architecte et \u00e0 l\u2019entrepreneur de ne pas se soumettre \u00e0 de teh ordres.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e, par son ing\u00e9nieur, a voulu imposer \u00e0 l\u2019appelant un mode d\u2019installation des mat\u00e9riaux qui constituait une condition contraire \u00e0 la loi, nulle et rendant nulle l\u2019obligation qui en d\u00e9pendait. Art. 1080 C.C. Nous avons donc tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments voulus pour appliquer l\u2019article 1202 du code civil qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s Mignault, 5 C.C., page 671, contient des dispositions que le Code Napol\u00e9on a pass\u00e9es sous silence. Le savant auteur fait remarquer que le code envisage ici le cas o\u00f9 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019obligation est devenue impossible apr\u00e8s que cette obligation a \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e. L\u2019ex\u00e9cution de l\u2019obligation, dans notre esp\u00e8ce, est devenue impossible par \u2018k faute et le fait, non du d\u00e9biteur, mais par !\u044e faute et le fait de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en voulant forcer l\u2019appelant \u00e0 d\u00e9roger \u00e0 une loi d\u2019ordre public. Nul n\u2019est tenu \u00e0 l\u2019impossible, et d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 13 suscit\u00e9, doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme impossible toute d\u00e9rogation \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public; on ne peut obliger personne \u00e0 violer la loi. Or, dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, on voulait forcer l\u2019appelant \u00e0 violer et le code civil concernant la dur\u00e9e des constructions, et la Loi d\u2019hygi\u00e8ne, en lui faisant ex\u00e9cuter des travaux dont on avait chang\u00e9 les sp\u00e9cifications telles qu\u2019autoris\u00e9es par le Bureau Provincial d\u2019Hygi\u00e8ne.\nL\u2019article 1202 ajoute:\nMais si l\u2019obligation a \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e en partie au profit du cr\u00e9ancier, ce dernier est oblig\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence du profit qu\u2019il en re\u00e7oit.\nNous devons donc, autant que faire se peut, remettre les parties dans l\u2019\u00e9tat o\u00f9 elles se trouvaient avant le contrat, en remboursant exactement \u00e0 l\u2019appelant des d\u00e9bours\u00e9s qu\u2019il a faits et prouv\u00e9s.\nJe suis donc d\u2019avis que l\u2019action doit \u00eatre maintenue pour le montant de $2,161.73 pour d\u00e9bours\u00e9s encourus par l\u2019appelant, et dont l\u2019intim\u00e9e a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9.\nElle n\u2019a pas d\u2019ailleurs contest\u00e9 cette r\u00e9clamation.\nQuant aux $600 r\u00e9clam\u00e9s pour salaire ou profit, je ne crois pas qu\u2019il serait juste de les faire payer par l\u2019intim\u00e9e. De m\u00eame que cette derni\u00e8re ne peut pas s\u2019enrichir aux d\u00e9pens de l\u2019appelant, ce dernier, de son c\u00e8te, ne peut faire de profit en vertu d\u2019un contrat dont il demande l\u2019annulation. D\u2019ailleurs, la preuve sur ce point n\u2019est pas suffisante. Je serais donc d\u2019avis de modifier le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure en retranchant cette somme de $600, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par le premier juge, laissant $2,161.73, pour lequel il y aurait jugement avec d\u00e9pens.\nLa demande reconventionnelle est bas\u00e9e sur la clause suivante du contrat:\n29\u00b0. Si les travaux ne sont pas commenc\u00e9s \u00e0 la date mentionn\u00e9e dans \u013eordre \u00e9crit de \u013eing\u00e9nieur ou ne sont pas achev\u00e9s \u00e0 la date prescrite, la municipalit\u00e9 pourra pourvoir \u00e0 leur ex\u00e9cution ou \u00e0 leur ach\u00e8vement d\u2019office aux frais, co\u00fbt et p\u00e9ril de l\u2019entrepreneur, soit en se procurant des ouvriers les mat\u00e9riaux n\u00e9cessaires, soit en employant ses ouvriers, soit en faisant souscrire par un autre entrepreneur \u00e0 son choix, une commission pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux non commenc\u00e9s ou laiss\u00e9s en souffrance. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, l\u2019entrepreneur devra arr\u00eater ses travaux \u00e0 partir du jour qui lui sera d\u00e9sign\u00e9, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi, les ouvrages qu\u2019il aura ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s post\u00e9rieurement seront acquis \u00e0 la municipalit\u00e9 sans qu\u2019il en soit tenu compte. La municipalit\u00e9 sera en droit de recourir aux m\u00eames mesures si elle constate que par la faute de l\u2019entrepreneur, les travaux sont interrompus ou tra\u00eenent en longueur de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 donner des craintes fond\u00e9es sur leur ach\u00e8vement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque fix\u00e9e par le cahier des charges sp\u00e9cial. Le village aura le droit de confisquer le d\u00e9p\u00f4t et l\u2019employer pour payer les frais qu\u2019elle aura ainsi encourus.\nCette mesure d\u2019office ou mise en r\u00e9gie n\u2019est qu\u2019une application de la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019article 1065 C.C. qui autorise le cr\u00e9ancier, en cas d\u2019inex\u00e9cution de la convention, \u00e0 la faire ex\u00e9cuter lui-m\u00eame aux d\u00e9pens de son d\u00e9biteur. Elle consiste dans la substitution d\u2019un g\u00e9rant charg\u00e9, sous la surveillance des agents administratifs, d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter les travaux aux risques et p\u00e9rils de l\u2019adjudicataire en retard. Elle ne fait pas dispara\u00eetre le contrat, qui reste obligatoire et continue de produire tous ses effets l\u00e9gaux. Elle permet seulement \u00e0 l\u2019administration, en \u00e9cartant un entrepreneur inhabile ou n\u00e9gligent, de poursuivre avec rapidit\u00e9 et dans les conditions stipul\u00e9es par les devis, l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux adjug\u00e9s.\nDans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, dans quels cas la mise en r\u00e9gie pouvait-elle \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9e? C\u2019est\n1\u00b0 Si les travaux ne sont pas commenc\u00e9s \u00e0 la date mentionn\u00e9e dans l\u2019ordre \u00e9crit de \u013eing\u00e9nieur;\n2\u00b0 S\u2019ils ne sont pas achev\u00e9s \u00e0 la date prescrite;\n3\u00b0 Si la municipalit\u00e9 constate que, par la jaute de l\u2019entrepreneur, les travaux sont interrompus ou tra\u00een\u00e9s en longueur, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 faire craindre qu\u2019il ne seront pas achev\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque fix\u00e9e.

Key (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1931: May 1, 4; 1931: May 18.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe, Rinfret, Smith and Cannon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nNegligence\u2014Collision between tram-car and automobile\u2014Contributory negligence\u2014Ultimate negligence\u2014Jury trial\u2014Findings\u2014Evidence\u2014New trial\u2014Questions to the jury\u2014Answers inconsistent\u2014Counsel not objecting nor asking for direction by trial judge.\nThe respondent, with her husband and child, was proceeding easterly on 49th Avenue in Vancouver in their automobile, her husband driving. On approaching the track of the appellant company across the road and seeing a tram-car coming from the south, the husband stopped his car, but as he saw a platform upon which people were standing, he thought that the tram-car would stop and he started to cross the track. The tram-car did not stop and consequently struck the automobile. As a result of the collision, the husband and child were killed and the respondent suffered serious injuries. The jury found that the employees of the appellant company were guilty of negligence and that the husband was also guilty of contributory negligence; but that, notwithstanding such negligence of the driver of the automobile, the motorman of the tram-car could have avoided the accident by the exercise of reasonable care. The jury then assessed the damages for which judgment was entered; and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The appellant company then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada mainly on the ground that the finding of the jury, in answer to question no. 8 (that, notwithstanding the negligence of the driver of the automobile, the appellant, by the exercise of reasonable care, could have avoided the accident), was inconsistent with the earlier findings of primary negligence of the appellant and contributory negligence of the respondent, and, moreover, that such finding on question no. 8 was not supported by evidence.\nHeld, Rinfret and Smith JJ. dissenting, that there was no conflict in the findings of the jury and that they were sufficiently warranted by the evidence.\nPer Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe and Cannon JJ.\u2014The appellant's contention, that the questions prepared for the jury and the answers thereto were insufficient and conflicting with each other and that a new trial should, therefore, be ordered, cannot be upheld, as the questions were drafted by both counsel, approved by the trial judge and submitted to the jury, whose answers and verdict were accepted without complaint by both parties, the appellant's counsel, moreover, not having asked for a more complete direction by the judge as to question no. 8, at the time of his charge. Per Rinfret and Smith (dissenting)\u2014The issue as to ultimate negligence was not properly put to the jury, either in the questions as framed, or in the charge of the trial judge; and it is impossible to say precisely in what the jury would, if asked, have found the ultimate negligence consisted. This lack of proper instruction as to the law bearing on the questions at issue, coupled with the apportionment of the degree of negligence and the finding of ultimate negligence, indicates that there was confusion in the minds of the jury, which may have affected all the findings. There should be a new trial as to the claim under what is commonly referred to as Lord Campbell's Act.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , affirming the judgment of Gregory J. and maintaining the respondent's action for damages.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nJ. W. de B. Farris K.C. and W. A. Riddell for the appellant.\nR. L. Maitland K.C. and C. M. O'Brian K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. and Newcombe J. was delivered by\nANGLIN, C.J.C.\u2014In this case the appellant confines its attack to finding no. 8 of the jury which, it contends, conflicts with the earlier findings of primary negligence of the defendant and contributory negligence of the plaintiff (which it did not challenge) and is not supported by the evidence. We can see no inconsistency in the findings.\nThe finding of \" ultimate\" negligence, viewed in the light suggested by counsel for the respondent (which was certainly an admissible position on the whole case as indicated by my brother Cannon) seems to be warranted by the evidence. It is true that the jury did not specify the particulars of that negligence; but, on the other hand, it is impossible to say that they were not right in answering the eighth question as they did, for there is evidence in support of the answer, and, in contrast with the finding upon the ninth question, it clearly indicates that it was the negligence of the defendant company which, in the opinion of the jury, caused the accident. (B.C. Electric Rly. Co. v. Loach)[2] . The appellant raised before us a complaint of non-direction with regard to the issue of ultimate negligence. It appears, however, that the learned trial judge, at the close of his charge, asked counsel if they had any objections, or suggestions, to make; and their answer was in the negative. Counsel had themselves framed and agreed upon the questions to be submitted to the jury. The burden was distinctly upon counsel for the appellant to satisfy this court that the answer to question no. 8 was unwarranted and, under the circumstances, he cannot complain of lack of specification by the jury of the particular ground upon which this finding is based, since he did not ask for any direction covering that point, nor that any question be put calling for such specification.\nAs was said by Lord Halsbury, in Nevill v. Fine Art & General Insurance Co.[3] , counsel can never, as of right, ask for a new trial for mere non-direction. The granting of a new trial on that ground is purely discretionary; a request for that relief should only be acceded to by the court where the interests of substantial justice require that course to be taken. We are far from satisfied that that is the case here, counsel having failed to convince us that the jury's answer to question no. 8 must have proceeded on some ground not warranted by the evidence, or which, in law, would not amount to \" ultimate \" negligence.\nUnder all the circumstances, we think that a new trial, restricted to the issue raised by question no. 8, would probably be unsatisfactory and might involve the re-taking of all the evidence, except as to the quantum of the damages. We think the interests of justice in this case will be best served by putting an end to the litigation; and, accordingly, we dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe view above expressed renders it unnecessary to consider the other question argued at bar, viz.: whether or not the Contributory Negligence Act applies to actions brought under Lord Campbell's Act.\nCANNON J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, which confirmed a judgment of Mr. Justice Gregory, assisted by a jury, in favour of the plaintiff for $5,150 in respect of personal injuries sustained by her in a collision between a tramcar, owned and operated by the appellant, and an automobile in which she was driving with her husband and child, who both then lost their lives; the respondent recovered a further sum of $25,000 as executrix of her late husband, Frank Key. Counsel for both parties agreed as to the questions to be put to the jury; and no objections were taken at the trial against the jury's answers nor to the judge's charge.\nThe questions and answers are as follows:\n1. Who was driving the auto?\u2014A. Mr. Key.\n2. Was the intersection\u2014the scene of the accident in a thickly peopled portion of the city of Vancouver?\u2014A. Yes.\n3. Was the defendant guilty of negligence which contributed to the accident?\u2014A. Yes.\n4. If so, what was such negligence?\u2014A. Considering the place and the conditions as shown by the evidence, the motorman of the northbound train was negligent in failing to stop when he saw the Key automobile approaching the crossing from his left and then allowed his attention to be diverted by looking to his right.\n5. Was the driver of the auto guilty of negligence which contributed to the accident?\u2014A. Yes.\n6. If so, what was such negligence?\u2014A. Although the driver of the Key auto took reasonable care as shown in the evidence by stopping his automobile before arriving at the crossing, it is our decision he did not take all necessary precautions before proceeding.\n7. If the defendant and the driver of the auto were both guilty of negligence, to what degree did the negligence of each contribute to the accident?\u2014A. The degree of negligence, defendant 90 per cent; plaintiff, 10 per cent.\n8. Notwithstanding the negligence of the driver of the auto, if any, could the defendant by the exercise of reasonable care have avoided the accident?\u2014A. Yes.\n9. Notwithstanding the negligence of the defendant, if any, could the driver of the auto by the exercise of reasonable care have avoided the accident?\u2014A. No.\n10.Damages, if any?\n(a) In respect to the plaintiff for personal injury?\u2014A. Section (a) in respect to the plaintiff for personal injury, pain and suffering, expenses $5,150 net.\n(b) As executrix of the estate of the late Frank Key?\u2014A. $200 per month to the plaintiff for the duration of her life to be paid by the defendant and guaranteed by a surety bond payable from date of accident, or alternatively, $25,000.00.\nThe appellant's case is based before this court on two propositions:\n1. \" That there is no evidence to support a finding of ultimate negligence as given in questions 8 and 9.\" This cannot be sustained on the motorman's evidence that he released his brakes at about the same time that his attention was fully turned to the motor moving very slowly towards the track. He says he could have stopped in seventy-five feet, but that he did not do so because the auto, in his judgment, showed every indication of waiting there until he had got past. He wrongly thought it would be all right to go ahead\u2014and must have kept his head turned to the other side until the collision took place. On this version of the appellant's employee, the jury exculpated the victim from the moment the motorman decided to go ahead without stopping at the station, on the rash assumption, in the jury's view, that the motor would stop and wait.\n2. \" The plaintiff cannot succeed in an action under the Families Compensation Act where there is a finding of contributory negligence against the deceased.\" In my opinion, the finding is one of ultimate negligence against the appellant and this ground also fails.\nBut, the appellant also contends that question 8 in connection with ultimate negligence\nCould the defendant by the exercise of reasonable care, notwithstanding the negligence of the plaintiff, have avoided the accident?\nis not sufficient and that there should have been added to it these words: \"at a time when the plaintiff no longer could have so avoided it\". Besides, the appellant claimed that the answers to questions 3, 4, 5 and 6 established contributory negligence of both parties and cannot be reconciled with the answer to question 8, in view of the failure of the jury to determine what the defendant could have done to avoid the accident notwithstanding the negligence of the victim.\nThe contention that the questions prepared for the jury and that the answers thereto were insufficient is fully met by the fact that the questions were drafted by counsel, approved of by the judge and submitted to the jury, whose answers and verdict were accepted without complaint by both parties. If the appellant desired a more complete direction as to question 8, or a fuller answer to it, it ought to have applied for it when it was possible to obtain it. Having been silent during the trial and when the answers were given, it waived the objection, if any, which it had a right to make and cannot now be allowed to urge such grounds for a new trial.\nIn the case of Williams v. Wilcox[4] , Lord Denman observed: It is the business of the counsel to take care that the judge's attention is drawn to any objection, on which he intends afterwards to rely.\nIn the present case the jury gave a unanimous verdict to which no objection was made at the time and now all this labour is to be set aside in order, at the cost and delay of a new trial, to get fuller answers which might have been obtained without delay, trouble or expense when the jury were in the box. I am therefore of opinion that we ought not now to maintain such objections to the questions or to the answers of the jury.\nThere is no appeal against the verdict for $5,000 awarded plaintiff for the personal injuries, which has been paid in full. It would therefore be impossible to retry this issue. Moreover, in its factum, the appellant does not ask for a new trial; it seeks to benefit from some alleged ambiguity in the findings to secure the dismissal of the whole claim for $25,000. This is not a case, in my view, where we would be justified, although competent to do so, in ordering a new trial, even restricted to the issue of ultimate negligence and of what it consisted in. To use Lord Halsbury's language in Nevill v. Fine Art and General Insurance Company[5] :\nwhat puts him (appellant) out of court in that respect is this, that where you are complaining of non-direction of the judge, or that he did not leave a question to the jury, if you have an opportunity of asking him to do it and you abstained from asking for it, no Court would ever have granted you a new trial; for the obvious reason that if you thought you had got enough, you were not allowed to stand aside and let all the expense be incurred and a new trial ordered simply because of your own neglect.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Smith JJ. (dissenting) was delivered by\nSMITH, J.\u2014In this case the issue as to ultimate negligence was not properly put to the jury, either in the questions as framed, or in the charge of the learned trial judge; and it is impossible to say precisely in what the jury would, if asked, have found the ultimate negligence consisted.\nIn my view, this lack of proper instruction as to the law bearing on the questions at issue, coupled with the apportionment of the degree of negligence and the finding of ultimate negligence, indicates that there was confusion in the minds of the jury, which may have affected all the findings. It is suggested to us that the jury was asked to apportion the degree of negligence merely in order to prevent the necessity of a new trial in case it should be finally held that a finding of ultimate negligence was not warranted. Nothing of this kind appears on the record, and there is no reference to it in the questions as asked, nor in the charge of the learned judge to the jury. I am therefore of opinion that there should be a new trial as to the claim under what is commonly referred to as Lord Campbell's Act.\nCounsel on both sides were responsible for the questions as framed, and neither of them directed the attention of the learned trial judge to his failure to explain the law to the jury.\nIn view of this joint responsibility, the costs of this appeal should be costs in the cause.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: V. Laursen.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C. M. O'Brian.\n[1] (1931) 43 B.C.

An employee of defendant was killed while engaged in switching operations in defendant's yard. The accident was not seen, but he was found dead on the ground after \"riding\" down a \"hump\" a car which, as later found, had a defective brake. Plaintiff, mother of deceased, recovered, on verdict of a jury, judgment for damages, which was affirmed by the Appellate Division, Alta.\nHeld: Defendant's appeal to this Court should be dismissed. The jury were justified in concluding, as the reasonable inference from the facts and circumstances in evidence (nature and tendency of the defect in the brake, deceased's duty at the time, his operation and position when last seen before the accident, direction of car, position of body when found, etc.), that it was defendant's negligence in having in use the defective brake which caused deceased to fall and be killed. (Jones v. Great Western Ry. Co., 47 T.L.R. 39, at 45; Cottingham v. Longman, 48 Can. S.C.R. 542, and other cases cited.)\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, dismissing its appeal from the judgment of Walsh J., entered upon the verdict of a jury, in favour of the plaintiff for the sum of $6,000 damages for the death of the plaintiff's son who was killed while in defendant's employ and, according to plaintiff's allegations, by reason of defendant's negligence. The material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported. The appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and C. F. H. Carson for the appellant.\nS. J. Helman K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nCANNON J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta unanimously dismissing an appeal from a judgment in the sum of $6,000 entered in favour of plaintiff after a trial with a jury.\nAt the time of his death, Murray, the respondent's son and sole support, was a young man of twenty-two years of age and had been in the employment of the appellant as switch tender, although, at the time of his death, with the consent and approval of the company, he was actually performing the duties of a yardman. Murray was killed on the 27th September, 1927, at nine o'clock in the evening, and was then engaged in switching operations over a \"hump\" in the appellant's yard at Calgary. When a car reaches the level or upper portion of the \"hump,\" a \"rider\" gets on the car and takes his place at the brake and the car is then pushed down the incline sufficiently to permit it to run by-gravity and also to enable a test to be made of the holding power of the brake. After the holding power of the brake has been ascertained, the car is cut loose from the remainder of the train and proceeds by gravity down the \"hump,\" along the lead track into one of the tracks in the classify- ing yard. The \"rider\" controls the speed of the car by operating the brake as the car goes down and brings it to a stop at its ultimate destination.\nOn the night of the accident, Murray asked yardman Mosgrove to change places with him in order that he (Murray) might get some experience as a yardman. Mosgrove agreed and, with the knowledge and consent of the foreman, Murray proceeded to ride cars off the \"hump.\" Murray mounted a flat car on which was loaded a combine thresher. The hand brake is at the front of the car and the person operating it stands on its floor. The top of the brake reaches up to about the rider's waist.\nMurray proceeded to attempt to set the brake, which was found difficult to use. Finally, however, the brake was set, the pin was drawn and the car was released and started on its way down the gradient at about six miles per hour. At a dividing switch, at 122 feet from the place of the accident, the car with Murray on it passed one Jack, a switch tender, who was standing at that point and was the last person to see him alive. Murray was then standing at the front of the car with his right hand on the brake wheel and his left hand on the \"club\" which had been put through the wheel on the mast. Jack saw Murray a short distance west of him making an effort to put his brake on with the brake club by shoving with his club in his left hand and pulling with his right hand on the wheel. A noise was next heard like a car going off the track and was investigated by several witnesses. It was found that the car had not run off the track but that it had passed over Murray, who was found dead by Buckwell on the fork between the ninth and tenth switches in the receiving yard, at a distance of 122 feet from where Jack had last seen him.\nThe brake on the car is designed with a series of pinions, one gear fitting into the other and the large gear having a chain which wraps around the brake mast; the gear and the chain are below the platform of the car and are not visible to the person operating the brake.\nIt is common ground that the brake was not in good working order. The car was inspected after the accident by the car foreman and the master mechanic, and they found a defect in the construction of the large gear which was not a true circle and did not lie flat when laid on a flat surface; it had evidently been warped in the casting in its manufacture.\nIt is also common ground that this defective gear would bind at certain points, with the effect that when the brake wheel was turned it became stiff once in every turn. It is proven by the evidence of Steele, A. E. Whitlock, F. E. Whitlock and Meechan, that it was very difficult to turn the brake past the binding point and that when it went past that point, the brake unloosed so quickly that it would cause, or was likely to cause, a person to lose his balance and pitch forward. Indeed, Steele, who tested the brake immediately after the accident, swears that when the brake went past the binding point he swung right off the end of the car, but, as he was \"hanging on,\" he did not fall off but swung right around.\nThe running or visual inspection by the appellant company of the hand brakes on freight cars at every terminal failed to disclose the defect in the construction of this gear. Mr. Jamieson, the divisional superintendent, admits that this defect could not be discovered unless the car was dismantled, so that an inspection made while the brake was on the car would only disclose that there was difficulty in turning it; but the exact nature of the defect could not accurately be judged by a \"rider,\" who could not realize the extent and nature of the risk he was running when using this brake.\nIn presence of this evidence, the only remaining ground of appeal, and the only one to which, at the hearing, the respondent was called upon to address himself, is whether or not the negligence of the company or its employees in allowing Murray to use this defective brake really caused his death. In other words, did the learned trial judge err in refusing the appellant's motion for non-suit made on the ground that, assuming negligence to be established, such negligence was not shown to be the cause of the death of the deceased?\nTo use the words of Viscount Hailsham, in the comparatively recent case of Jones v. Great Western Railway Co.[1], does the plaintiff's evidence in the present case \"take us beyond the region of conjecture into that of legal inference?\" Upon the evidence, could the jury reasonably reach the conclusion that the real cause of the accident was inferentially established by the presence of facts too strong to be ignored?\nAmongst other facts, we have:\n1. The test made after the accident of the tendency of the brake to throw a man off his balance;\n2. The brake required to be turned to tighten it and would become stiff once in every revolution;\n3. The duty of Murray was to use this brake to control the speed of the car and this was the sole operation which he had to perform on that car at the time of his death;\n4. The witness Jack saw Murray at 122 feet before he was killed with his hands on the brake, travelling at six miles an hour, which would reasonably lead to the conclusion that he had continued to use, and was actually using, the brake at the time he reached the fatal spot;\n5. The position of the body on the track and the marks on the car also help to render not unreasonable the conclusion that the defective brake caused Murray to fall in front of the car;\n6. The car was travelling in an easterly direction. Murray, when last seen, had his right hand on the front wheel and his left hand on the club inserted in the wheel. If he was pushing with his left hand, the tendency would be to throw him east and south, if the brake were suddenly unloosed.\nThe jury could reasonably infer from these facts, considering the position of the body after the accident, that the fall had been caused by the negligence of the company in allowing this defective brake to be placed in commission and used on this occasion by its employee. I believe that the evidence establishes not only that the accident was possibly due to the negligence to which the plaintiff seeks to ascribe it; but the evidence, to use the words of Lord MacMillan, in the above quoted case[2], is such that the attribution of the accident to that cause may reasonably be inferred. I think that we may safely apply to plaintiff's evidence the test propounded by the noble Lord as follows: (1) The dividing line between conjecture and inference is often a very difficult one to draw. A conjecture may be plausible but it is of no legal value, for its essence is that it is a mere guess. An inference in the legal sense, on the other hand, is a deduction from the evidence, and if it is a reasonable deduction it may have the validity of legal proof. The attribution of an occurrence to a cause is, I take it, always a matter of inference. The cogency of a legal inference of causation may vary in degree between practical certainty and reasonable probability. Where the coincidence of cause and effect is not a matter of actual observation there is necessarily a hiatus in the direct evidence, but this may be legitimately bridged by an inference from the facts actually observed and proved. Indeed, as Lord Shaw said in Marshall v. Owners of SS. Wild Rose[3]: \"The facts in every case may leave here and there a hiatus which only inference can fill.\" The true doctrine in the matter is clearly stated by Lord Penzance in Parfitt v. Lawless[4]: \"It is not intended to be said that he upon whom the burthen of proving an issue lies is bound to prove every fact or conclusion of fact upon which the issue depends. From every fact that is proved legitimate and reasonable inferences may, of course, be drawn, and all that is fairly deducible from the evidence is as much proved for the purpose of a prima facie case as if it had been proved directly.\" I conceive, therefore, that in discussing whether there is in any case evidence to go to the jury, what the Court has to consider is this, whether, assuming the evidence to be true, and adding to the direct proof all such inferences of fact as in the exercise of a reasonable intelligence the jury would be warranted in drawing from it, there is sufficient to support the issue.\nIn this case, we have facts proven which establish relation between the defective brake and the accident, as the victim was seen with his hands ready to use the same brake a few moments before it happened. Moreover, the defect was of a nature and created a danger which was likely to cause the operator to lose his balance and be thrown off the car. Here, we certainly have more evidence to satisfy the jury, than there was in McArthur v. Dominion Cartridge Company[5].\nSee also Grand Trunk Railway Company v. Griffith[6]. In Cottingham v. Longman[7], this Court held: \"A series of facts may be proved in evidence from which the jury may reach a conclusion, as to the cause of the mishap, in some respects more satisfactory than if they were obliged to depend upon the deposition of an eye-witness.\" As Chief Justice Fitzpatrick said in the last mentioned case (pp. 543-544), \"the function of an appellate court is to consider in each case whether there was evidence before the jury from which they could reasonably draw the conclusion at which they arrived.\"\nHere, too, the finding of the jury has the approval of the provincial Court of Appeal as well as of the trial judge, and it should not be disturbed.\nIn our opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] (1930) 47 T.L.R. 39.\n[2] 47 T.L.R. 39, at 45.\n[3] 26 T.L.R. 608; [1910] A.C. 486, at 494.\n[4] (1872) L.R., 2 P. & D., 462, at 472.\n[5] [1905] A.C. 72.\n[6] (1911) 45 Can.

The respondent\u2019s son was playing with a small tricycle in a lane behind his father\u2019s house; in that lane, facing the house, the appellant had placed a cement mixer at a short distance from a garage which he was constructing. The respondent\u2019s son, on his tricycle, approached the mixer and put his hand on the machine while in motion, with the result that his hand was caught and drawn into the machine, where it remained until he was extricated. The evidence shows that the machine had been left unattended and unguarded at the moment of the accident.\nHeld that, according to the circumstances of this case, the appellant was liable.\nPer Anglin \u0421.J.C. and Lamont and Cannon JJ.\u2014The allurement of a piece of machinery in motion for a small child is notorious, and anybody, operating such machinery upon, or so accessible from, a highway or public place as to make it dangerous to children lawfully about the neighbourhood, assumes the burden of so guarding the same as to make it practically inaccessible to them.\nAnglin \u0421.J.C., Lamont and Cannon JJ.\u2014An issue of contributory negligence or common fault cannot be raised as a ground of appeal in the case of a child under eight years of age, such an issue being eminently for determination by the trial judge, who, in the present case, has found in favour of the respondent. APPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the trial judge, D\u00e9saulniers J., and maintaining the respondent\u2019s action in damages for $5,000.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nL.

Th\u00e9berge K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. and Lamont and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nAnglin C.J.C.\u2014In our opinion this appeal must be dismissed with costs. The reasons given by Mr. Justice Guerin, in dismissing the appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, are quite convincing; and the facts on which he bases his conclusions find ample support in the evidence.\nThe allurement of a piece of machinery in motion for a small child is notorious, and anybody, operating such machinery upon, or so accessible from, a highway or public place as to make it dangerous to children lawfully about the neighbourhood, assumes the burden of so guarding the same as to make it practically inaccessible to them. (Beven on Negligence, 4th ed., 189; Cooke v. Midland G.W. Rly.[1]; Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Coley[2]. To fence the machine here (as was suggested) was, probably, not practicable. But, Mr. Justice Guerin points out, there was no reason why the defendant should not have it so guarded and looked after by some one of his employees that children, who were known to be in the neighbourhood, and in the habit of playing there, should be kept away from it. This duty the defendant failed to discharge, the machine in motion having been left unattended and unguarded at the moment of the accident. Of this fact there is abundant evidence, and, upon it alone, we are satisfied that the provincial courts were justified in holding the defendant liable.\nAs to contributory negligence or common fault, it is, in our opinion, almost out of the question to raise such an issue as a ground of appeal in the case of a child under eight years of age, i.e., barely above the age under which all responsibility must be denied. Eminently an issue for determination by a trial judge, an appeal from his finding upon it is almost hopeless. The trial judge, \u0456n the present instance, found in favour of the plaintiff; and his finding is conclusive. (Delage v. Delisie[3]; 1 Sourdat, \u201cResponsabilit\u00e9,\u201d no. 17).\nThe judgment of Newcombe and Smith JJ. was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014The boy was nearly eight years of age and his home was in the immediate vicinity of the work, and it is conceded for the purposes of the case that the machine was partly upon the lane, contiguous to which the work was in progress. Each case must, I think, be decided upon its own facts, and I agree that this appeal should be dismissed; but I am not satisfied to assent to the general proposition that in all cases there is an absolute duty.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Genest, G\u00ealinas & Renaud.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Th\u00e9berge & Th\u00e9berge.\n[1] [1909] A.C. 229.\n[2] (1907) Q.R. 16 K.B. 404.\n[3] (1901) Q.R. 10 K.B. 481.\n"}

But the appellate court ordered a new trial on the ground of misdirection by the trial judge in not instructing the jury properly as to the application to the case of the doctrine of common fault, and as to the use to be made of annuity tables by the jury in arriving at the amount of the verdict.\nHeld that the order for a new trial pronounced by the appellate court should not be interfered with.\nPer Anglin C.J.\u0421. and Smith J.\u2014It is unnecessary to decide the question whether or not the respondent was entitled as a matter of right to the order for a new trial made by the appellate court, as the result of the trial is so unsatisfactory that this court in the exercise of its own judicial discretion, inherent and statutory, ought to affirm such order.\nPer Duff, Rinfret and Cannon JJ.\u2014As to the question whether counsel for the respondent, at the trial, has \u201cduly excepted to such misdirection\u201d by the trial judge in the manner provided for by article 498 C.C.P., the circumstances of this case and the entries in the book of proceedings show that there has been a sufficient compliance with the requirements of the code. Moreover, per Duff, Rinfret and Smith JJ., this being a matter of practice and procedure, the judgment of the appellate court should be clearly wrong before this court ought to reverse it.\nPer Duff, Rinfret and Smith JJ.\u2014The fact that no mention of a by-law of the city of Montreal applicable to the case was made by the trial judge, in his charge made in French, (although asked to do so), and also the manner in which it was referred to in his charge made in English, amounted to a refusal \u201cto instruct (the jury) on a matter of law\u201d (Art. 498 C.C.P.) and constituted an additional reason for granting a new trial.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 50 K.B. 414) aff.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Duclos J., in favour of the appellant and ordering a new trial.\nThe appellant was conducting a horse-driven truck out of a yard when he noticed a street car, some distance away; thinking that he had sufficient time to cross the tracks, he continued his way, but the tram-car struck the wagon killing one of the horses and throwing the appellant on the pavement, causing him serious injuries. The appellant brought an action in damages against the respondent company, and the latter alleged in its plea that the appellant was to blame in driving his truck in front of a moving tram-car when so close as to render the accident inevitable. The jury found the appellant was blameless and having in no way contributed to the accident and assessed the damages at $23,040, the full amount claimed. The trial judge rendered judgment according to the verdict. The respondent then appealed to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, first, on the ground that the damages awarded were excessive, and also on grounds of misdirection: first, as to the doctrine of common fault, and, second, as to the use to be made of annuity tables in assessing damages. As to the question of common fault the trial judge made the following remarks: \u201cThat question is put to the jury because both parties might be at fault, but, as a rule, I would say that in nine cases out of ten, there is no such a thing as a common fault; there is generally one determining fault that causes the accident, and the other one is not a contributing fault in the sense of the law. I might say, with due respect to my fellow judges, that the common fault is often only an easy way to decide a doubtful case. When it is not quite clear who is at fault, they say: Both at fault, and let it go at that.\u201d As to the question of the annuity tables, the trial judge gave these directions: \u201cD\u2019apr\u00e8s les tables d\u2019assurance, \u00e0 trente ans, s\u2019il \u00e9tait normal, il devrait vivre trente-cinq ans de plus. On vit plus longtemps que cela des fois, mais il y en a qui vivent moins longtemps; trente-cinq ans c\u2019est la moyenne. Et \u00e0 cet \u00e2ge-l\u00e0, pour acheter une rente viag\u00e8re de cent dollars, cela lui co\u00fbterait dix-sept cent quatre-vingt-deux dollars ($1,782) et pour deux cents dollars ($200) le double et ainsi de suite. Si vous arrivez \u00e0 la conclusion que quand il \u00e9tait normal il gagnait mille dollars ($1,000) et qu\u2019aujourd\u2019hui il ne peut pas gagner plus, disons, que cinq cents dollars ($500) ce sera une base avec la table d\u2019assurance, pour \u00e9tablir le montant des dommages que vous devez accorder pour cet item-l\u00e0. Ce sera un guide pour vous aider. Vous direz: il perd cinq cents dollars ($500) par ann\u00e9e. Si pour se rattrapper il veut acheter une pension viag\u00e8re, il faudra qu\u2019il paie cinq fois dix-sept cents quatre vingt-deux dollars ($1,782). S\u2019il verse entre les mains d\u2019une compagnie d\u2019assurance dix-sept cent quatre-vingt-deux dollars ($1,782) la compagnie va lui payer cent dollars ($100) par ann\u00e9e pour le reste de sa vie. Les rentes viag\u00e8res plus vous \u00eates jeune, plus \u00e7a co\u00fbte cher. Quand vous \u00eates vieux, \u00e7a ne co\u00fbte plus bien cher. Cela n\u2019est pas une r\u00e8gle absolue, c\u2019est seulement un moyen, une indication pour vous aider \u00e0 arriver \u00e0 une conclusion.\u201d The Court of King\u2019s Bench set aside the verdict and ordered a new trial on the ground that the trial judge had misdirected the jury in these two important respects and substantial prejudice had thereby been occasioned. The appellant then appealed to this court and urged as his first ground of appeal (which was also raised before the Court of King\u2019s Bench) that the objections to the particular statements made by the trial judge in his charge to the jury-were not taken at the proper time. Under the Code of Civil Procedure (art. 498),\na new trial may be granted:\n* * *\n3. When the judge has misdirected the jury or refused to instruct them on a matter of law, and the party complaining has duly excepted to such misdirection or refusal.\nBut the causes for a new trial, mentioned in this paragraph,\ncan be ascertained only by means of the minutes of trial, and when the party has caused his objections to be entered therein.\n(art. 506, C.C.P.). With regard to the minutes of trial, the code contains the following provisions:\n466. The prothonotary keeps, under the direction of the judge, full minutes of the proceedings at the trial, including all admissions, and all exceptions taken, or objections made, orally in court.\n467. A copy of such minutes is made out by the prothonotary, and, after being certified by the judge, is filed of record, and is held to be the true record of all proceedings mentioned therein, and stands in lieu of any bill of exceptions by either party against the evidence or the trial.\nWhat took place after the learned trial judge had completed his address to the jury is recited thus in the minutes of trial:\nLes jur\u00e9s se retirent aux fins de d\u00e9lib\u00e9rer.\n* * *\nM. Vall\u00e9e fait quelques exceptions \u00e0 l\u2019adresse du juge et M. Genest y r\u00e9pond. Le tout est st\u00e9nographi\u00e9.\nThe material parts of the stenographic report referred to and thereby incorporated in the minutes of the trial read as follows:\nMe Genest, C.R., conseil du demandeur:\nLa cour voudrait-elle demander aux parties si elles d\u00e9sirent que quelque chose soit ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 votre charge?\nLe juge: C\u2019est apr\u00e8s que le jury sera retir\u00e9. (Les jur\u00e9s se retirent. Le juge aussi se retire.)\nExceptions \u00e0 la charge du juge aux jur\u00e9s.\nApr\u00e8s la charge aux jur\u00e9s, alors que le juge et les jur\u00e9s se sont retir\u00e9s de la salle d\u2019audience, Me Arthur Vall\u00e9e, \u0421.R., avocat de la d\u00e9fenderesse, fait la d\u00e9claration suivante: Le procureur de la d\u00e9fenderesse excipe respectueusement de la charge du juge aux jur\u00e9s pour les raisons suivantes:\n* * *\nParce que le pr\u00e9sident du tribunal n\u2019a pas \u00e9clair\u00e9 suffisamment le jury sur les dispositions du r\u00e8glement 890 de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, et surtout sur les dispositions de \u013earticle 64 du contrat entre la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al et la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse;\nParce qu\u2019il a mal d\u00e9fini la faute commune et mal avis\u00e9 les jur\u00e9s, en leur disant qu\u2019il ne pouvait y avoir faute commune en l\u2019occurrence, de m\u00eame qu\u2019il les a mal avis\u00e9s en r\u00e9f\u00e9rant au montant n\u00e9cessaire pour payer une annuit\u00e9.\nUnder the above circumstances the effect of the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench is that the manner in which the objections were taken was a compliance with the articles of the code sufficient to found a judgment ordering a new trial.\nR. Genest K.C. and \u0412. Robinson for the appellant.\nArthur Vall\u00e8e K.C. for the respondent.\nAnglin, C.J.C.\u2014After giving full consideration to this case and to the arguments of counsel for the appellant and respondent, respectively, I am of the opinion that it is not possible for us to interfere with the order for a new trial. Having reached this conclusion, I abstain, as is our custom, from comment on the evidence or discussion of the facts. Without necessarily agreeing with the view of the Court of King\u2019s Bench that there had been sufficient compliance by counsel for the respondent company with art. 498 (3), I think that, in a proper exercise of judicial discretion, we should refrain from interfering with the order pronounced by that court. The trial already had, having regard to the manner in which the case was presented by the learned trial judge to the jury, cannot, as a whole, be regarded as other than most unsatisfactory.\nIt is almost impossible to say whether the jury was, or was not, properly instructed as to the application to the case at bar of the doctrine of common fault. Indeed, what was said by the learned trial judge may well have been taken by some members of the jury to amount to a withdrawal from its consideration of that issue. Yet, there certainly is evidence in the record of circumstances from which it might be inferred by the jury, as a reasonable deduction, that the plaintiff was not entirely free from fault.\nUpon the other point of alleged misdirection, viz., as to the use to be made of annuity tables by the jury in arriving at the amount of their verdict, the charge is also unsatisfactory, because, although it may not be possible to point to any particular statement of the learned judge, in the course of his directions in regard to the use the jury might make of these tables, as clearly erroneous, the charge was \u201cout of harmony with the ideas that have always obtained as to the manner in which a jury should deal with\u201d such tables, when presented for its consideration. Nor does the charge, read as a whole, so qualify or modify the effect of either of these objectionable features as to render them clearly inocuous. This case does not fall within art. 500 C.C.P.\nPersonally, I should have been prepared to accept our decision in Barthe v. Huard2, as conclusive that a new trial should be had in this case, even if counsel for the defendant had failed to comply with the requirement of art. 498 (3) in regard to taking exceptions to the charge at the trial, before verdict, and in the actual presence of the trial judge. But I understand that some of my learned brethren take a different view of the decision in Barthe v. Huard[2]. I, therefore, do not base this judgment upon it.\nThere, no objection to the charge was taken at the trial, although formal objections in writing were filed after verdict, on the morning following the hearing. Notwithstanding this state of facts, however, this court, reversing the Court of King\u2019s Bench, ordered a new trial. To quote from the judgment of Davies J., concurred in by Girouard and Duff JJ., a majority of the court,\nWhile the judge\u2019s charge to the jury was not objected to as a whole, objection was taken to a particular part of it in which the judge told the jury that \u201cthey should consider the case as if the charge of drunkenness had been made against themselves, their brother or their friend.\u201d\nI cannot but think that this was an entirely wrong and false doctrine to lay down as to the proper functions of a jury. It was calculated to mislead their minds as to the manner and extent to which they should assess the damages or make their findings.\nIt is possible that if the learned judge\u2019s attention had been called to this language and its full meaning at the time, and objection taken to it he would have corrected the apparently misleading direction before the jury had retired, or if they had already retired, before they had agreed upon their verdict, but no such objection was taken at the time.\nThis only goes to shew the imperative necessity of Courts of Appeal insisting, when asked to grant new trials as a matter of right, that only objections to particular statements made by the judge in his charge to the jur\u0443 will be considered or given effect to when it is shewn that objection has been taken to them at the time when their misleading character can be corrected before the jury.\nA converse case came to this court in Lamontagne v. Quebec Light, Heat & Power Company[3], of which the headnote reads, in part, as follows:\nWhere no objection has been taken to the judge\u2019s charge to the jury at the trial and it does not appear that any substantial prejudice was thereby occasioned there should not be an order for a new trial under the provisions of articles 498 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nHere, the objections on both points of misdirection by the learned trial judge are to be found formulated in the stenographer\u2019s notes which were, apparently, made part of the minutes of trial referred to in art. 506 \u0421.\u0421.\u0420., and, on that ground, would seem to have been treated by the Court of King\u2019s Bench as having been properly taken as exceptions under art. 498 (3), \u0421.\u0421.\u0420., and as entitling the respondent to a new trial as a matter of right. It is said, however, by counsel for the appellant that, although these objections are found in the stenographer\u2019s notes, those notes also shew that they were taken after the learned judge had left the bench and while the jury was deliberating, and that they were not known to the trial judge until after the verdict. In answer to this, counsel for the respondent assures us that they had been stated, in substance, to the learned judge before he left the bench and that they were inserted in the stenographer\u2019s notes by his express direction. I find it unnecessary to pass upon the question of fact raised by this regrettable contradiction.\nIn my view, it is also unnecessary now to decide the question discussed by this court in Barthe v. Huard[4], and impliedly passed upon in Lamontagne v. Quebec L.H. & P. Co.3, as to whether or not the respondent was entitled, as a matter of right, to the order for a new trial made by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, since I think that the result of the trial already had is so unsatisfactory that we should, in the exercise of our judicial discretion, inherent and statutory (R.S.C., c. 35, s. 47), affirm the order of the Court of King\u2019s Bench for a new trial. Without, therefore, involving art. 495 \u0421.\u0421.\u0420., and without expressing approval or disapproval of the ground on which the Court of King\u2019s Bench based its order, I accept its conclusion. The costs of the appeal to this court shall be to the defendant in any event of the cause, to be set off against the amount of any verdict which the plaintiff may obtain on a new trial.\nThis somewhat unusual disposition is made in ease of the plaintiff, who might otherwise be embarrassed by having to pay these costs forthwith. As a price of this concession in favour of the plaintiff, I think it reasonable to order the set-off directed,\u2014the whole in the exercise of the discretion conferred on us by s. 48 of the Supreme Court Act.\nThe judgment of Duff and Rinfret JJ. was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014For the reasons given in the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, we agree that the particular statements referred to therein and made by the learned trial judge in his charge to the jury were of a misleading character and substantial prejudice to the respondent must have been thereby occasioned. (Art. 500 C.P.)\nThe appellant urged that the misdirection complained of could not be made the ground of an order for a new trial, because, as he alleged, the objections to the misdirection were not taken at the proper time.\nIt is not disputed that the objections were taken before verdict. Further, we must hold that they were entered in the minutes of trial as required by art. 506 C.P. They form part of the stenographic report. The minutes of trial state the fact that the objections were made and refer to the stenographic report for the purpose of ascertaining what the nature of these objections was. But the contention is that they were taken after the judge had retired, and, therefore, at a time when the misleading character of the charge could not be corrected before the jury.\nThe article of the Code of Civil Procedure dealing with this question reads as follows:\u2014\n498. Subject to the qualifications stated in the next following articles, a new trial may be granted in any of the following cases:\n* * *\n3. When the judge has misdirected the jury or refused to instruct them on a matter of law, and the party complaining has duly excepted to such misdirection or refusal.\nThe French version uses the word \u201cobject\u00e9\u201d as the corresponding word for \u201cexcepted.\u201d It will be noticed that the article provides for two distinct cases: the first is misdirection and the second is non-direction. When there has been non-direction, the judge \u0432 must be asked to instruct the jury on the point of law he has omitted to discuss; and if he refuses, exception must be taken to his refusal. When there has been misdirection, all that is required, according to the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, is that the party complaining should have \u201cduly excepted to such misdirection.\u201d\nThat is precisely what the respondent has done in the present case. The entry is as follows:\u2014\n\u201cLe procureur de la d\u00e9fenderesse excipe respectueusement de la charge du juge aux jur\u00e9s pour les raisons suivantes,\u201d etc.\nThe Court of King\u2019s Bench held that that was a sufficient compliance with the requirements of the code, and it gave effect to the objections.\nAs a mere question of the interpretation of the code, we are not prepared to differ from the Court of King\u2019s Bench on that point. Moreover, this being a matter of practice and procedure, we should be slow in reversing the judgment of the court of last resort of the province on a question of that kind.\nWhat we have said thus far would be sufficient to dispose of the appeal; but, as there is to be a new trial, we think our view ought to be stated as to a further point raised by the respondent.\nAt the time of the accident which gave rise to the present action, there was in force, in the city of Montreal, bylaw no. 890 entitled: \u201cR\u00e8glement relatif \u00e0 la circulation et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique.\u201d This by-law contained the following article:\u2014\nArticle 15. Le conducteur d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule, en virant \u00e0 une crois\u00e9e ou en passant d\u2019une ruelle, d\u2019un garage ou d\u2019une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e, dans une rue, doit avertir de son intention de ce faire, avancer avec beaucoup de prudence et attendre qu\u2019il ait un passage libre.\nWhile the presiding judge was addressing the jury, counsel for the defendant asked him to call their attention to that by-law. Acceding to the request, the learned judge made reference to it in the following way:\nThere is a by-law of the city of Montreal known as by-law 890, an article of which I will read to you.\nArticle 15 of that by-law reads as follows: (It is in French, I will translate it.) \u201cThe conductor of a vehicle, making a turn at an intersection, or coming out of a lane or of a private property into a street, must give notice of his intention so to do, advance with great prudence and wait until the way is clear.\nThat is the by-law. I am not going to tell you it applies to this case or not, that is the by-law.\nNo mention whatever of the by-law was made by the learned trial judge when addressing the French-speaking jurors. The absence of any reference to the by-law in the charge made in French and the manner in which it was referred to in the charge made in English amounted, in our view, to a refusal \u201cto instruct (the jury) on a matter of law.\u201d\nOn this point, even if the construction put forward by the appellant should prevail, all the requirements of art. 498 (3) of the code were fully met, and exception to the refusal was duly taken.\nWe think it was the duty of the trial judge to instruct the jury as to the legal purport of article 15 of the by-law and to tell them that they should consider whether, upon the proven facts, the plaintiff complied with it and, if not, how far his failure to do so had any bearing upon the accident which happened later. The refusal of the trial judge so to instruct the jury, is an additional reason why a new trial should be granted.\n1. The disposition made by the Court of King\u2019s Bench of the costs of the appeal to that court should not be disturbed. We notice, however, that, evidently through an oversight, no mention was made of the costs of the abortive trial. This clerical omission should be corrected by stating that these costs should be costs in the cause.\n2. The costs of the present appeal should be to the respondent in any event; but, for the reasons stated in that respect by our Lord the Chief Justice, we think the right of the respondent to claim them should be suspended until after the new trial, at which time, if the appellant should secure a verdict in his favour, the respondent will be entitled to set off the said costs against the amount of that verdict; if, on the contrary, the verdict should be against the appellant, the respondent will then be entitled, if so advised, to collect his costs in the usual way, the bond given by the appellant upon his appeal to this court to remain in force in the meantime. Smith, J.\u2014One of the grounds of appeal is that objections to the misdirection of the trial judge were not taken at the time and in the manner required by the Code of Civil Procedure, article 498. The Court of King\u2019s Bench have held against this contention, and I agree with my brother Rinfret that we should not lightly interfere with the judgment of that court upon a mere matter of practice and procedure unless there is clear error. This, in itself, might be a sufficient ground for dismissing this appeal.\nI am, however, also in agreement with my Lord the Chief Justice that the trial already had, having regard to the manner in which the case was presented by the learned trial judge to the jury, cannot, as a whole, be regarded as other than most unsatisfactory; and that the result of that trial is so unsatisfactory that we should, in the exercise of our discretion under article 495 and R.S.C., c. 35, s. 47, affirm the order of the Court of King\u2019s Bench for a new trial. There is no doubt that, in view of the express provisions of article 498 as to new trials, resort for the granting of a new trial should not ordinarily be had to these general provisions. Where, however, the ends of justice clearly require it, as here, this may be done.\nIn addition to the misdirection on the two points referred to in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, I am in agreement with what my brother Rinfret says as to the by-law he refers to, and there is also to be noted the evident lack of information upon the part of the jury when they proceeded to consider their verdict. An amendment of the claim for damages had been asked and granted at the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case, by which the amount of damages originally claimed under each heading was greatly increased. The answer of the jury as to the amount of damages that they awarded was first in the following words: \u201cPlein montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 * * * Unanime\u201d. Then we have, in the \u201cextrait du proc\u00e8s-verbal d\u2019audience\u201d, the following:\nLes jur\u00e9s reviennent dans la salle d\u2019audience.\nAppel\u00e9s, ils r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 leurs noms et ils donnent les r\u00e9ponses qui suivent.\nMais comme ils ne sp\u00e9cifient pas clairement les dommages qu\u2019ils accordent, la cour leur demande de retourner dans leur chambre de d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations, et d\u2019exprimer par un chiffre le montant des dommages qu\u2019ils conviennent d\u2019accorder.\nCe qu\u2019ils font pour revenir avec leurs r\u00e9ponses compl\u00e9t\u00e9es \u00e0 la satisfaction du tribunal. From this it is quite clear that the jury, in returning the verdict for the full amount claimed, had no idea of what that amount was, and were prepared to give a verdict for the full amount, whatever it might be. They were sent back to find out the amount in figures, and then returned with the amount $23,040 filled in, after the words \u201cPlein montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9\u201d.\nA verdict for this large amount, arrived at in this manner, is certainly unsatisfactory, and a strong ground for ordering a new trial.\nI agree with the disposition of the costs of this appeal proposed by my Lord the Chief Justice and my brother Rinfret, and agree with the latter that the costs of the abortive trial should be provided for as he suggests, and that it would be well to have it specially mentioned that the bond for costs of appeal to this court is to remain in force.\nCannon, J.\u2014Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s dans ses notes par l\u2019Honorable Juge-en-chef de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, je suis d\u2019avis de confirmer l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour du Banc du Roi accordant un nouveau proc\u00e8s.

The following resolutions relevant to the issues involved in this appeal were passed. Resolution no. 3 provided that any two of the four senior officers of the company, namely, the two vice-presidents and the treasurer, were authorized on behalf of the company to make, sign, draw, accept or endorse cheques, etc., and, by resolution no. 4, it was also provided that \u201call securities, documents and instruments signed, made, drawn, accepted or endorsed as aforesaid shall be valid and binding upon the company.\u201d The respondent bank had no knowledge of these resolutions. Throughout the period with which this appeal is concerned, Dr. Robert Harvie was the president and Milton F. Gregg was a vice-president and the treasurer of the company. On the 9th of August, 1927, a cheque signed in the name of the company by Robert Harvie alone, for $4,250 payable to himself or to his order, was presented at the branch of the respondent and, although incomplete since it bore the signature of only one officer of the company, whereas under the terms of the above mentioned resolution, it should have been signed by two, it was accepted for payment by the accountant of the branch, charged against the company\u2019s account therein and paid in due course through the personal account which Harvie had in the same branch of the bank. Milton F. Gregg, who was one of the officers of the company duly authorized for and on its behalf inter alia to receive all paid cheques and other vouchers and to sign the bank\u2019s form or settlement of balances and release, on the 5th of November, 1927, received from the bank a detailed statement of the company\u2019s account with the bank for the three months ending the 31st of October preceding and the cheques and vouchers for the various items mentioned in the statement, and signed and delivered to the bank what is referred to as a \u201cverification slip\u201d and which in fact is the bank\u2019s form of settlement of balances and release whereby the company undertook forthwith to examine the statement and vouchers and to inform the bank within ten days of anything in them that was found to be incorrect, agreeing that the statement should be conclusive evidence of the correctness of the balance therein shown and that the bank should be released from all claims by the company in respect of each and every item shown therein, save such as were questioned or notified in writing to the bank. Harvie Smith & Company, Limited, assigned in bankruptcy in October of the next year (1928) and Mr. W. E. Dunton was appointed its trustee in bankruptcy. He found the said cheque of 9th August, 1927, among the papers of the company that were turned over to him and instituted the present action to recover from the bank the amount thereof, on the ground that it was paid by the bank out of the company\u2019s funds without authorization. Mr. Dunton was later on replaced as trustee by the present appellant, who continued the action to judgment.\nThe Superior Court, Patterson J.[3] maintained the appellant\u2019s action, but the judgment was reversed on appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench[4].\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, after hearing counsel for the appellant and the respondent, judgment was reserved; and, at a later date, judgment was rendered dismissing the appeal with costs. Mr. Justice Smith, who delivered the judgment of the court, after stating the facts of the case, made the following observations: \u201cNo objection to the payment by the bank of this cheque was ever made by the company. The vice-president and treasurer Gregg had full authority to sign the release on behalf of the company, and prima facie that document is binding on the company. No evidence was offered to displace the prima facie defence thus established, and it is therefore un- necessary to discuss here under what state of facts or circumstances a customer of the bank might be relieved from the ordinary effect of such a release.\u201d\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nJohn Ahern K.C. for the appellant.\nL.

The appeal to this Court was allowed with costs.\nD. L. McCarthy K.C. for the appellant.\nNo one for respondents.\nAnglin C.J.C\u2014I would allow this appeal with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Smith and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014In this case, the information of the Attorney-General of Canada sheweth that on or about the 5th day of December, 1929, at Albertville, in the province of Saskatchewan, one S. A. Bovan, an officer of His Majesty\u2019s Excise of Canada, under the authority of a writ of assistance and in accord with the provisions of section 181 of the Excise Act, did seize as having become subject to forfeiture to His Majesty a certain vehicle, to wit: a one-and-a-half ton Fargo Express, Serial No. 283531, Engine No. KT1690, covered by Saskatchewan Licence 1929 No. T-18-678; that, at the time of such seizure, the said vehicle was being used by one Max Krakowec for the purpose of removing spirits in his possession unlawfully manufactured contrary to the provisions of the said section 181; and that, on the 5th day of December, 1929, before John Ashby and John Rosser, two of His Majesty\u2019s Justices of the Peace in and for the province of Saskatchewan, at Prince Albert, Krakowec was duly convicted of having in his possession a quantity of spirits of unlawful manufacture.\nThe information further sheweth that Alfred Dahlberg and Paul A. Eklund, residing and carrying on business at Prince Albert aforesaid, under the firm name and style of Dahlberg and Eklund, and that Continental Guaranty Corporation of Canada, Limited, a corporation having its head office in Montreal in the province of Quebec, and doing business in the province of Saskatchewan, severally claim interest in the said vehicle. They are made parties to the suit with Krakowec; and the prayer of the Attorney-General, as against all of them, is for a declaration and judgment that the said vehicle has become and is forfeited to His Majesty.\nOnly one statement of defence was filed on behalf of all the defendants. It alleged that Krakowec was in possession of the vehicle only by virtue of an agreement in writing whereby it was mutually understood that the property in and title to the Fargo express did not pass to him, but remained in Dahlberg & Eklund until the entire purchase price was fully paid in cash; that the agreement created a lien on the vehicle; that there was a balance owing by Krakowec to the Continental Guaranty Corporation to which Dahlberg & Eklund had assigned their rights and to which they remained liable under guarantee; that Dahlberg & Eklund and the Guaranty Corporation had no knowledge that Krakowec intended to use the vehicle for the unlawful purpose of which he was found guilty and, had they known it, they would not have sold the vehicle to him, nor financed the sale to him. They pray therefore that the claim be dismissed.\nThe action was tried, without the adducement of evidence, on the following admission of facts:\n\u201cIt is admitted by counsel for the plaintiff and the defendants that:\u2014\n\u201c(1) Action has been instituted herein on the information of the Attorney-General of Canada for the purpose of obtaining, should the facts warrant it, a declaration and judgment that the vehicle in the information described has become and is forfeited to His Majesty. \u201c(2) On December 5, 1929, S. A. Bovan, an Excise Officer carrying a Writ of Assistance, and \u0421. E. Buck of the Prince Albert Town Station encountered at Albertville, Sask., one Max Krakowec, then driving the truck described in paragraph 4 of the information.\n\u201c(3) Bovan, under authority of the Writ, searching the truck found therein two bottles of spirits, one under the seat and one in the back, a third being found in Krakowec\u2019s pocket.\n\u201c(4) Bovan seized the spirits and truck as forfeited under section 181 of the Excise Act, duly served notice of seizure on Max Krakowec and laid information before John Ashby, J.P., against Krakowec in respect of having in his possession spirits of unlawful manufacture contrary to section 181.\n\u201c(5) At trial the same day before the said Ashby, J.P., and another, Rosser, Max Krakowec pleaded guilty and had sentence imposed.\n\u201c(6) The truck remained in the custody of the noncommissioned officer in charge of R.C.M.P. Town Station, Prince Albert, Sask.\n\u201c(7) On December 12th Messrs. Diefenbaker and Elder wired the Department of National Revenue as follows:\nMax Krakowec on Dec. fifth pleaded guilty to offence under section 181 Excise Act Stop Fargo truck owned by accused still held by police Stop Please wire authorization to proper officials to release said truck to the accused.\n\u201c(8) On December 17, the department having been made aware of the circumstances, wrote in reply that \u2018the truck is regarded as confiscated.\u2019\n\u201c(9) Under letter of December 23rd Messrs. Dahlberg and Eklund submitted the following document which they held out as a true copy of the sales contract covering the said truck:\n(The agreement is here recited in full.)\n\u201c(10) The said Dahlberg and Eklund were informed in reply that the Act sets out no qualification as to ownership and that the truck was regarded as confiscated.\n\u201c(11) On January 24, 1930, the Continental Guaranty Corporation of Canada, Limited, issued unsealed warrant to one, S. \u0421 Anderson, its bailiff, to take pos- session of the said truck. The said bailiff on the 25th of January, in attempting to seize the truck, handed * * * the warrant to a constable and received the same back forthwith:\u2014\n(Here the warrant is recited.)\n\u201c(12) The said truck was not then, or at any time by or on behalf of any defendant herein, removed from the possession of the non-commissioned officer above mentioned.\n\u201c(13) The said solicitors under letter dated January 25, 1930, forwarded the said copy of warrant to, and made demand for immediate delivery over of the said truck of, the Minister of Excise.\n\u201c(14) By virtue of the claim to the said truck so laid and the provisions of section 125 of the said Act the automatic condemnation of the said truck was avoided and the right of the claimant to have his claim adjudicated upon preserved.\n\u201c(15) The defendant Krakowec lays no claim and stands subject to having judgment signed against him on the pleadings.\n\u201c(16) The defendants Dahlberg and Eklund have assigned to the Continental Guaranty Corporation of Canada, Limited, all interest of them or either of them in the said truck or arising out of the said contract of sale.\n\u201c(17) The defendant the Continental Guaranty Corporation of Canada, Limited, claims the right to have delivered over to it the said truck or the sum of $672.55, the moneys still owing in respect thereof by the said Krakowec on the grounds that as assignee it stands in the shoes of Dahlberg and Eklund the vendors, is entitled to all the rights before assignment enjoyed by the said vendors, including title to and power to repossess the truck for cause.\n\u201c(18) The following question submitted in the pending summons is calculated to decide the claim put forward by the said corporation defendant:\u2014\n\u201cIs the vehicle referred to in paragraph numbered 4 of the information filed seized under section 181 of the Excise Act in the circumstances set forth in paragraphs numbered 4 and 5 of the said information liable to forfeiture notwithstanding that the legal owners of the vehicle in question had, prior to the said seizure, no notice or knowledge of the illegal use which was being made of the vehicle by the defendant Krakowec when the same was seized as alleged in said paragraph numbered 4?\u201d\nThe Exchequer Court[2] dismissed the action largely, if not altogether, on the ground that the relevant provisions of section 181 apply only to vehicles \u201cwhich have been or are being used for the purpose of removing the\u201d spirits unlawfully manufactured or imported; and, as the court thought, the evidence failed to show that, in the circumstances, the Fargo express was being used for the purpose of \u201cremoving\u201d within the meaning which the court ascribed to that word in the enactment.\nDealing with that point first, with deference, we think it should be eliminated as a ground of judgment.\nAs a result of the admissions upon which the parties agreed to submit the case, it must be assumed that all the necessary formalities for the effective seizure of the vehicle were complied with and the required procedure was followed. Further, it was not disputed that the vehicle was seized under circumstances which, by force of section 181 of the Excise Act, made it liable to forfeiture to the Crown. But it was granted that Krakowec, in whose possession the vehicle was seized, was not the legal owner thereof; and the question put to the court\u2014and the only question\u2014was whether a vehicle, otherwise undisputably liable to forfeiture under the Excise Act, is to be held so liable notwithstanding that its legal owner had, prior to seizure, no notice or knowledge of the illegal use which was being made of it?\nIt is therefore to that question alone that we must now confine our attention.\nThe Exchequer Court thought the statute was not so clear as to manifestly bring within its ambit innocent third parties without any knowledge of the illegal use to which their vehicle was being put; and, in the premises, it decided to give the defendants the benefit of the doubt. The courts in several of the provinces of Canada have already had occasion to pronounce upon the same enactment, and also, in other instances, upon texts which, though not contained in the same statute, were not dissimilar in their essential provisions. Thus, in Forget v. Forget and General Motors Acceptance Corporation[3], the Superior Court in Quebec took the same view as the learned trial judge in this case. In The King v. Traders\u2019 Financial Corporation (In re Excise Act)[4], Gait J. in Manitoba, thought the language of the statute, construed literally, involved unjust consequences which the legislature could not have intended, unless it had manifested such an intention by express, and not merely general words. Accordingly he held that when goods seized under the Excise Act belonged to an innocent third party, who duly claimed them, the Crown was not entitled to forfeit the goods.\nOn the other hand, in Rex v. Martch[5], a case under the Ontano Temperance Act, and in McDonald v. Clarke[6], a case from Nova Scotia, the contrary view prevailed.\nSpecial attention should be given to the decision of Stein J., in Le Roi v. Messervier et L\u00e9gar\u00e9 Automobile de Montmagny Limit\u00e9e[7], where the learned judge, though apparently of the opinion that liability to forfeiture was absolute under sec. 181 (then sec. 185) of the Excise Act, decided he had the power to exercise a discretion under sec. 124 (then sec. 129).\nIt will thus be seen that the enactment in question has so far given rise to quite a diversity of opinion. It has now become the duty of this court to express its views upon it.\nIn order to do so more conveniently, it is necessary to quote section 181:\n181. Every person who sells or offers for sale, or who purchases, or has in his possession any spirits unlawfully manufactured or imported, whether the owner thereof or not, without lawful excuse, the proof of which shall be on the person accused, is guilty of an indictable offence, and shall, for a first offence be liable to a penalty not exceeding two thousand dollars and not less than two hundred dollars, and to imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for a term not exceeding twelve months and not less than one month, and, in default of payment of the penalty, to a further term of imprisonment not exceeding twelve months and not less than six months, and for every subsequent offence to a penalty not exceeding two thousand dollars and not less than five hundred dollars, and to imprisonment, with hard labour, for a term not exceeding twelve months and not less than six months, and in default of payment of the penalty, to a further term of imprisonment equal to that already imposed by the court for such subsequent offence; and all spirits so unlawfully manufactured or imported wheresoever they are found, and all horses and vehicles, vessels, and other appliances which have been or are being used for the purpose of removing the same, shall be forfeited to the Crown, and shall be dealt with accordingly.\nThe section, it will be noticed, sets out no qualification as to ownership of the \u201chorses and vehicles, vessels and other appliances which have been or are being used.\u201d On the contrary, it says that all such horses, vehicles, etc., \u201cshall be forfeited to the Crown, and shall be dealt with accordingly.\u201d Upon the bare words of the enactment it must, therefore, follow that any vehicle used for the purpose of removing spirits unlawfully manufactured or imported is subject to the forfeiture therein prescribed, unless something be found in the context or in the general scope of the Act to justify a departure from the well known rule that the intention of the legislature must be determined from the words it has selected to express it. Here we find nothing of the kind in the context or in the subject-matter of the statute. The learned trial judge observed that, when dealing with penalties, the expression \u201cwhether the owner thereof or not\u201d is used in the section, while it is not there when the section comes to deal with the forfeiture. But the explanation is that it was necessary, in order to avoid doubt, to insert the expression in the one case, while it was not in the other. In the first part of the section,, mere possession is the mischief aimed at by the legislature. Now, possession may be possession by the owner, or it may be possession in the name of or for another; and it was, of course, essential, in the premises, to specify that \u201c possession\u201d alone would be sufficient to incur the penalty, \u201cwhether\u201d the person found in \u201cpossession\u201d of the spirits was \u201cthe owner thereof or not.\u201d It was not so, however, in that part of the section dealing with the forfeiture of vehicles, and the other appliances mentioned. It may be a question whether, the legislature having once said that the penalty was incurred by the mere possessor, whether owner or not, the expression does not ipso facto extend to the whole section without the necessity of its being repeated. It is sufficient to say that, in the provision respecting forfeiture, the object in view is the connection between the vehicles and the spirits unlawfully manufactured or imported. The point is that the vehicles \u201chave been used or are being used for the purpose of removing the same\u201d; and it is immaterial to whom the vehicles belong. In the words of Sedgwick J., in The Ship \u201cFrederick Gerring Jr.\u201d v. The Queen[8],\nIn the enforcement of fiscal law, of statutes passed for the protection of the revenue or of public property, such provisions are as necessary as they are universal, and neither ignorance of law, nor, as a general rule, ignorance of fact, will prevent a forfeiture when the proceeding is against the thing offending, whether it be the smuggled goods or the purloined fish, or the vehicle or vessel, the instrument or abettor of the offence.\nThat the proceeding is, under the Excise Act, \u201ca proceeding against the thing,\u201d that is, in the nature of a proceeding in rem, is apparent throughout the Act (Sees. 79, 83, 121, 124, 125, 131, etc.), but is nowhere more evident than in sec. 125, under which\nall vehicles, vessels, goods and other things seized as forfeited * * * shall be deemed and taken to be condemned and may be dealt with accordingly, unless the person from whom they were seized, or the owner thereof, * * * gives notice * * * that he claims or intends to claim the same.\nAs will be noticed, the automatic condemnation is against the thing seized. Moreover, the right to object is given both to the owner and \u201cthe person from whom (it was) seized\u201d\u2014a right quite incompatible, if forfeiture resulted only in cases where the owner was also the offender.\nWe agree that, when the meaning of a statute is doubtful or ambiguous, the courts should not, unless otherwise compelled to do so, give it that interpretation which might lead to unjust consequences; but even penal statutes must not be construed so as to narrow the words of the statute to the exclusion of cases which those words, in their ordinary acceptation would comprehend (Dyke v. Elliott; The \u201cGauntlet\u0165\u201d[9]); and it is surely not for the judge so to mould a statute as to make it agree with his own conception of justice (Craies on Statute Law, 3rd ed., pp. 86, 444). Adverting to the particular case before us, it is not assuming too much to say that it must have been known to the legislature, when it passed the Excise Act, that a great many drivers of motor vehicles are not the owners thereof, but possess and operate them subject to conditional sale agreements, and if sec. 181 was meant to apply only to vehicles driven by the owners thereof, it is obvious with what ease the provision respecting forfeiture could be evaded.\nWhether such a thing exists as what is referred to by Lord Cairns (in Partington v. Attorney-General[10]) as the \u201cequitable construction\u201d of a statute, we cannot see that this is a case for its application, and we find no reason why we should not simply adhere to the words of the enactment.\nIt is not for the court to say if, in some cases,\u2014such as, for example, when the vehicle utilized was stolen from its owner\u2014the forfeiture may effect a hardship. Such cases are specially provided for in subs. 2 of sec. 133 of the Excise Act. The power to deal with them is thereby expressly vested in the Governor in Council, thus leaving full play to the operation of sec. 91 of the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act (c. 178 of R.S.C., 1927), for the remission of forfeitures. We are unable to agree with the decision in Le Roi v. Messervier[11], already referred to, that the discretionary power is also vested in the court under sec. 124 of the Act. In our view, that section means nothing more than this:\nAfter the vehicles, vessels, goods and other things have been seized as forfeited under sec. 181, the person from whom they were seized, or the owner thereof, may prevent the automatic condemnation of the said vehicles, etc., by giving notice as provided for in sec 125 \u201cthat he claims or intends to claim the same\u201d; whereupon, an information for the condemnation of the vehicles, etc., having been filed (as was done in this case), the court may hear and determine the claim made by the person from whom they were seized or from the owner, and the court may release or condemn the vehicles, etc., as the case requires, i.e., according as they come or not under the provisions of the Act. The court thereunder is vested with no discretion, it must decide according to law. The appeal must be allowed and judgment should be entered granting the conclusions in the information of the Attorney-General of Canada, with costs both here and in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] [1931] Ex.

The wording of the section is that the conflict must be \u201cwith the judgment of any other court of appeal.\u201d In my view, those words used without qualification in a Canadian statute mean any other Canadian court of appeal. When the legislature of this country uses language of that kind it must be taken to refer to courts within its jurisdiction, and not to courts outside the Canadian territory. (Jeffrys v. Boosey [2]; Cooke v. Charles A. Vogeler & Company[3]. It is to no purpose to argue that criminal courts in Canada may, and possibly will, follow the decisions of the English courts of criminal appeal. The whole question here is what parliament is presumed to have intended when referring to \u201cany other court of appeal\u201d in section 1025 of the Canadian Criminal Code; and I think the principle is that general words in a statute refer only to persons or things within the territory, unless the con intention is shewn.\nIn addition to the rule just stated, we have in section 1012 of the code the legislative interpretation of the words in question precisely for that part of the Criminal Code dealing with appeals from convictions on indictments. Under subsection (b) of section 1012,\n\u201ccourt of appeal\u201d means the court designated by paragraph (7) of section. 2 of this Act (i.e., the code) as the court of appeal from the province in which the conviction or indictment was had.\nParagraph 7 of section 2 just mentioned is an enumeration of the courts of the several provinces of Canada which are stated to be included in the expression \u201ccourt of appeal.\u201d\nThe evident intention of Parliament in enacting section. 1025 was to insure uniformity in the administration of criminal law by the courts of Canada. Bearing that in mind, the expression \u201cany other court of appeal\u201d should, I think, be interpreted as meaning any other court of appeal to which \u201ca like case\u201d may be brought under the Canadian Criminal Code, and therefore: any other court of appeal in Canada.\nI have, for these reasons, reached the conclusion that the petitioner does not allege nor show a conflict between the courts of appeal contemplated by section 1025 of the Criminal Code, and that this is not a case where I have jurisdiction under that section to grant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe petitioner relied, of course, on the decision in Brunet v. The King[4], where special leave was granted in not dissimilar circumstances. It will be seen, however, that when the case came before the full court (including the learned judge who granted leave), the court took particular care to state (Brunet v. The King)[5], that it was not. \u201cpassing on the question of whether or not this is an appealable matter, even with leave.\u201d\nFor that reason, I feel that I am at liberty to decide as above. If I am wrong the appellant may yet find relief by asking the full court to revise my decision. (In re Sproule[6]; The Industrial Acceptance Corporation v.

Act, s. 92 (10), (a).\nThe B.C. Co. (British Columbia Electric Ry. Co.) was incorporated in England and operates in British Columbia under a provincial licence. Under agreement with the C.P.R. Co. (Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.) it operates by electricity the V. & L.I. Ry. (Vancouver & Lulu Island Ry.) which connects with the C.P.R. and which, in 1901, was leased to the C.P.R. Co. for 999 years, and was declared by Parliament to be a work for the general advantage of Canada. The B.C. Co.\u2019s \u201cCentral Park Line\u201d runs from Vancouver to its connection with a branch of the V. & L.I. Ry. and thence over the latter to the latter\u2019s terminus at or near New Westminster, from which terminus the B.C. Co.\u2019s \u201cCentral Park Line\u201d continues for one mile to a point where it makes physical connection with the Canadian National Ry. The Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, by its order No. 42808, of June 10, 1929, directed the B.C. Co. and the Canadian National Rys. to publish and file, between stations on the V. & L.I. Ry. and points on the Canadian National Rys., \u201cvia direct connection between the companies,\u201d joint rates on the same basis as those published between the said V. & L.I. points and stations on the C.P.R. The B.C. Co. appealed against the order on the ground of lack of jurisdiction in the Board to compel it to file joint rates as aforesaid over the said one mile of its line, which, it contended, was subject only to provincial jurisdiction. Held (Cannon J. dissenting): The Board had not jurisdiction to make the order.\nThe jurisdiction (as to railway companies incorporated elsewhere than in Canada) conferred by s. 6 (a) of the Railway Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 170, is, on its proper construction in the light of ss. 5 and \u03b8 as a whole, limited to the company\u2019s operation of lines of railway within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada. To construe s. 6 (a) otherwise would raise the question of its constitutional validity (Att.-Gen. for Quebec v. Att.-Gen. for Canada; Insurance Reference, [1931] 3 W.W.R., 689; [1932] 1 D.L.R. 97, referred to in this connection).\nThe Board did not acquire jurisdiction over the B.C. Co.\u2019s line by virtue merely of that company\u2019s operation also of another line which was under Dominion jurisdiction. Nor would the facts that a part of the B.C. Co.\u2019s line formed a connecting link between two lines of railway under the Board\u2019s jurisdiction, one of which extended beyond the limits of the province, and that the B.C. Co. handled traffic over its provincial lines to and from lines of railway under Dominion jurisdiction, extending beyond the limits of the province, pursuant to agreements with companies owning and operating those lines under Dominion jurisdiction, be a ground for invoking s. 92 (10) (a) of the Act in support of the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. Nor could the order be upheld on the ground that it dealt with the regulation of trade and commerce. Nor did the Board have jurisdiction by virtue of ss. 314, 316 and 317 of the Railway Act, the remedying of any discrimination in the manner provided in the order involving, as it did, the exercise of jurisdiction over said mile of railway which was under provincial jurisdiction.\nMontreal v. Montreal Street Ry., [1912] A.C. 333, cited and discussed. Luscar Collieries v. McDonald, [1927] A.C. 925, distinguished.\nPer Cannon J., dissenting: The B.C. Co. fell under the wording and operation of said s. 6 (a), and s. 6 (a) was intra vires.\nAPPEAL from the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, No. 42808, issued June 10, 1929[1], directing the British Columbia Electric Railway Co. Ltd. and the Canadian National Railways to publish and file, between stations on the Vancouver and Lulu Island Railway and points on the Canadian National Railways via direct connection between the companies, joint rates on the same basis as those published between the said Vancouver and Lulu Island points and stations on the Canadian Pacific Railway; and from an order of the Board, No. 44417, of March 7, 1930, dismissing the applications of the British Columbia Electric Railway Co. Ltd. and the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. to review and rescind said Order No. 42808.\nLeave to appeal was granted by a judge of this Court (under s. 52 (2) of the Railway Act) upon the following questions: 1. Had the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, under the circumstances of this case, jurisdiction under the Railway Act to issue Order No. 42808 in so far as it directs the British Columbia Electric Railway Company Limited to publish and file joint rates between stations on the Vancouver and Lulu Island Railway and points on the Canadian National Railway via direct connection between the British Columbia Electric Railway Company Limited and the Canadian National Railway?\n2. If the above question should be answered in the affirmative, had the Parliament of Canada jurisdiction to confer upon the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada authority to compel the British Columbia Electric Railway Company Limited to publish such joint rates over the route in question?\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Smith J., now reported, and are indicated in the above headnote. Question No. 1 was answered in the negative; in view of that answer, it was unnecessary to answer question No. 2. Cannon J. dissented, and would answer both questions in the affirmative.\nJ. W. de \u0412. Farris K.C. and W. A. Riddell for the appellant the British Columbia Electric Ry. Co. Ltd.\nL. Cot\u00e9 K.C. for the appellant (intervenant) the City of Vancouver.\nG. F. Macdonell K.C. for the respondent the Canadian National Ry. Co.\nE. F. Newcombe K.C. for the respondents the North Fraser Harbour Commissioners.\nL. J. Ladner K.C. for the respondent the Province of British Columbia.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Duff, Lamont and Smith JJ.) was delivered by\nSmith J.\u2014The appellant, the British Columbia Electric Railway Company, Limited, is a corporation, incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act of England, operating street railways and interurban services in and around the city of Vancouver, having authority so to operate in the province of British Columbia by virtue of a provincial licence issued pursuant to statutes of that province.\nIn pursuance of this licence, this company acquired, as a going concern, all the property, business, undertakings and franchises of the Consolidated Railway Company, which was incorporated by an Act of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, and- thus became the owner and operator of the British Columbia Electric Railway, running on the streets of Vancouver, thence in a southeasterly direction to the city of New Westminster, and along some of the streets of that city, and referred to in these proceedings as the Central Park Line.\nThe Vancouver & Lulu Island Railway Company was incorporated by an Act of the Legislature of the Province of British Columbia, and, in pursuance of its powers, constructed, about the year 1900, a railway commencing at a point of connection with the railway of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in the city of Vancouver, and extending southerly to Eburne Junction, on the north side of the north arm of the Fraser river at or near Marpole on the plan produced, and thence southerly across this north arm to Steveston, on the north side of the south arm of the Fraser river; and, in 1908, constructed a branch line from Eburne Junction along the north shore of the north arm of the Fraser river, to New Westminster.\nIn 1901 the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, pursuant to the authority of an Act of the Parliament of Canada, leased from the Vancouver & Lulu Island Railway Company the railway of the latter for a term of 999 years, and by an Act of the Parliament of Canada, 1 Edw. VII, ch. 86, the railway and works of the Vancouver & Lulu Island Railway Company were declared to be works for the general advantage of Canada.\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Company acquired all the capital stock of the Vancouver & Lulu Island Railway Company, and in pursuance of its lease, financed the construction of its lines, and operated several portions thereof directly, as part of its railway system, until these were taken over for electric operation by the appellant, the British Columbia Electric Railway Company, under agreements made in 1904 and 1905, confirmed by Acts of the Canadian Parliament in 1907 and 1909, under the terms of which the British Columbia Electric Railway Company operates the Vancouver & Lulu Island Railway by electricity and performs the necessary switching and terminal services in connection therewith, on behalf of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\nBy virtue of these agreements the Electric Railway Company owns, controls and operates trains and rolling stock on and over the Vancouver & Lulu Island Railway.\nThe British Columbia Electric Railway, running as mentioned above, from Vancouver to New Westminster, and referred to as the Central Park Line, connects with the Vancouver & Lulu Island Railway branch running from Eburne Junction, at or near Marpole, to New Westminster, at the easterly terminus of said branch at or near New Westminster, and continues for the distance of about one mile to a point where it makes physical connection with the Canadian National Railway lines at New Westminster, the one mile of the Central Park line forming a direct connecting link between the Vancouver & Lulu Island lines and the Canadian National lines.\nUpon application to the Board of Railway Commissioners by the North Fraser Harbour Commissioners and others, the Board made an order, No. 42808, dated June 10, 1929, directing the British Columbia Electric Railway Company Limited and the Canadian National Railways to publish and file, between the stations on the Vancouver & Lulu Island Railway and points on the Canadian National Railways, \u201cvia direct connection between the companies,\u201d joint rates on the same basis as those then published between the said Vancouver & Lulu Island points and stations on the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nThe appellants appeal against this order upon the ground of lack of jurisdiction in the Board to compel the British Columbia Electric Railway Company to file joint rates with the Canadian National Railways over the one mile of their street railway referred to, which railway, they contend, is subject only to provincial jurisdiction.\nOn behalf of the respondent, it was argued that the order does not necessarily require the publishing of joint rates over the one mile of the Central Park line referred to, because the order might be complied with by routing traffic in some other direction or over some other lines. There is nothing to show that this could be done otherwise than by using the lines of the Canadian Pacific Railway, there being no direct physical connection between the lines of the Vancouver & Lulu Island Railway Company and the Canadian National Railway Company, at Vancouver or elsewhere. In any event, in view of what appears on the record, it is clear that the words \u201cvia direct connection between the companies,\u201d as used in the order, means, by way of the one mile of the Central Park Railway mentioned above.\nIt is argued that, as the Central Park Railway is operated by the British Columbia Electric Railway Company, incorporated in England, jurisdiction over it in connection with its operation of the Central Park Railway is conferred upon the Board by virtue of section \u0431 of the Railway Act, which reads as follows:\n6. The provisions of this Act shall, without limiting the effect of the last preceding section, extend and apply to\n(\u0430) every railway company incorporated elsewhere than in Canada and owning, controlling, operating or running trains or rolling stock upon or over any line or lines of railway in Canada either owned, controlled, leased or operated by such company or companies, whether in either case such ownership, control, or operation is acquired by purchase, lease, agreement or by any other means whatsoever;\n(b) every railway company operating or running trains from any point in the United States to any point in Canada;\n(c) every railway or portion thereof, whether constructed under the authority of the Parliament of Canada or not, now or hereafter owned, controlled, leased, or operated by a company wholly or partly within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, or by a company operating a railway wholly or partly within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, whether such ownership, control, or first mentioned operation is acquired or exercised by purchase, lease, agreement or other means whatsoever, and whether acquired or exercised under authority of the Parliament of Canada, or of the legislature of any province, or otherwise howsoever; and every railway or portion thereof, now or hereafter so owned, controlled, leased or operated shall be deemed and is hereby declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada.\n2. The provisions of the last preceding paragraph of this section shall be deemed not to include or apply to any street railway, electric suburban railway or tramway constructed under the authority of a provincial legislature, and which has not been declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada otherwise than by the provisions of the said paragraph. 1919, c. 68, s. 6; 1920, c. 65, s. 1.\nIt is pointed out that the appellant, the British Columbia Electric Railway Company, is a company incorporated elsewhere than in Canada and operates trains on lines of railway in Canada owned, leased or operated by the company within the precise language of this section, 6 (a), and that therefore the Board is expressly given jurisdiction over this appellant in connection with its operation of the Central Park Line, though that line is a provincial undertaking carried on within the province under provincial authority. If this be so, the Board has jurisdiction over the whole tramway of the company, quite independently of its connection with the other railways, and over all purely local railways in Canada that happen to be operated by any company that has not been incorporated in Canada.\nReading the whole of sections 5 and 6, the true construction seems to be that the jurisdiction conferred by section 6 (a) over the company is limited to its operation of lines of railway within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.\nIt does not follow that the Board acquires jurisdiction over the street railway or the Park line by virtue merely of its operation also of another line of railway which is under Dominion jurisdiction. There is nothing abnormal about its being under provincial jurisdiction in connection with its operation of the one, and under Dominion jurisdiction in connection with its operation of the other.\nTo construe section 6 (a) otherwise than indicated above would raise the question of whether or not such legislation is ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament. The recent decision in the Privy Council in Attorney-General for Quebec v. Attorney-General for Canada in what is known as the Insurance Reference[2] and not yet in the official reports, would seem to be an authority against the validity of this section. It is there laid down that\na Dominion licence, so far as authorizing transactions of insurance business in a province is concerned, is an idle piece of paper conferring no rights which the party transacting in accordance with provincial legislation has not already got, if he has complied with provincial requirements.\nThis has reference to British and foreign companies doing business in Canada under provincial licences, and indicates that the mere fact that a company is British or foreign does not give the Dominion Parliament jurisdiction over it, in connection with the carrying on, as here, of a purely local work under provincial authority.\nIt is, however, urged that, by virtue of the British North America Act, section 92, head 10 (a), jurisdiction is conferred on the Board over this company in connection with its operation of the provincial or Central Park line, or part of it, because that part forms a connecting link between two lines of railway admittedly under the jurisdiction of the Board, one of which extends beyond the limits of the province, and because it handles traffic over its provincial lines to and from lines of railway under Dominion jurisdiction, extending beyond the limits of the province, pursuant to agreements with companies owning and operating those lines under Dominion jurisdiction.\nThis one mile of the Central Park line, it is argued, thus becomes a part of a continuous system of railways extending beyond the boundary of British Columbia into other provinces.\nAgainst this contention the case of City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway[3] is cited. There the Montreal Street Railway was constructed and was operated under special Acts of the Province of Quebec, and the Montreal Park and Island Railway was also constructed under provincial authority, but had been declared to be a work for the general advantage of Canada, and had thus come under Dominion jurisdiction. The lines of the two railways were physically connected at different points, both within and without the limits of the city of Montreal, and arrangements existed between them for the traffic of passengers and their continuous passage from points on the line of each to points on the line of the other, and the cars of each railway ran over the tracks of the other. The Board of Railway Commissioners, on application to it, found as a fact that the Montreal Park and Island Railway unjustly discriminated against the residents of Mount Royal, and in favour of the residents of the village of Notre Dame de Grace in respect of rates charged, and ordered it to grant the same facilities at the same rates to both classes of residents. It further ordered that with respect to through traffic over the Montreal Street Railway the company owning that railway should enter into any agreements that might be necessary to enable the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company to carry out the provisions of the order.\nAs both these companies were incorporated in Quebec, section 6 (a) of the Railway Act had no application in the case, and as neither line extended beyond the limits of the province or connected with lines extending beyond the limits of the province, section 92-10 (a) of the British North America Act had likewise no application.\nIt was, however, contended that there was jurisdiction under section 8 of the Railway Act, which, as it then stood, provided that any railway under provincial jurisdiction that connected with or crossed a railway under Dominion jurisdiction should be subject to the jurisdiction of the Act relating to, amongst other matters,\n(b) the through traffic upon a railway or tramway and all matters appertaining thereto.\nIt was held that this subsection (b), as regards provincial lines of railway properly so called, was ultra vires, and it no longer appears in the Act.\nIt was also held that power to authorize the Board to make the orders was not necessarily incidental to the exercise by Parliament of its jurisdiction over federal lines, and could not be upheld upon the ground that it dealt with the regulation of trade and commerce.\nThe case of Luscar Collieries v. McDonald[4], is cited in support of the jurisdiction of the Board in the present case. There the appellant company owned a short railway line in the province of Alberta branching from a line which branched from the Canadian Northern Railway at a point within the province. Both branches were operated by the Canadian Northern Railway Company under agreements, and traffic could pass from the appellant\u2019s line without interruption into such other provinces as were served by that company\u2019s railway.\nIt was held that the Board had jurisdiction over the appellant\u2019s lines constructed under provincial authority, because the line was part of a continuous system of railways operated together by the Canadian National Railway Company and connecting one province with another.\nThe decision is expressly put upon the way in which the railway is operated by the Canadian National Railway Company under the agreements, and it is intimated that if that company should cease to operate the appellant\u2019s branch, the question whether, under such altered circumstances, that branch ceases to be within s. 92, head 10 (a), might have to be determined. The question thus left undetermined is the very question that arises in the present case, because the Park line is not operated by the Canadian National Railway Company, nor by the appellant, the British Columbia Electric Railway Company, as the operator of the Vancouver & Lulu Island Railway, on behalf of the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nThe mere fact that the Central Park line makes physical connection with two lines of railway under Dominion jurisdiction would not seem to be of itself sufficient to bring the Central Park line, or the portion of it connecting the two federal lines, within Dominion jurisdiction.\nThe Montreal Street Railway case[5] referred to above seems to be authority against that view. It is there stated in the reasons for judgment[6],\nthat so far as the \u201cthrough\u201d traffic is carried on over the federal line, it can be controlled by the Parliament of Canada. And that so far as it is carried over a non-federal provincial line it can be controlled by the provincial Legislature, and the two companies who own these lines can thus be respectively compelled by these two Legislatures to enter into such agreement with each other as will secure that this \u201cthrough\u201d traffic shall be properly conducted; and further that it cannot be assumed that either body will decline to co-operate with the other in a reasonable way to effect an object so much in the interest of both the Dominion and the province as the regulation of \u201cthrough\u201d traffic.\nThe same case is authority against the contention that the power of the Board in this case is necessarily incidental to the exercise by Parliament of its jurisdiction over the federal lines, and that in any case the order can be upheld on the ground that it deals with the regulation of trade and commerce. The facts and circumstances in connection with the present case do not seem to give a stronger basis for these contentions than existed in the previous case.\nIt has been further contended that the Board has jurisdiction by virtue of sections 314, 316 and 317 of the Railway Act, particularly because of the discrimination which it has found as a fact to exist. The argument is that the Board, having jurisdiction over the appellant, the British Columbia Electric Railway Company Limited, by virtue of its operation of the Vancouver & Lulu Island Railway, which is under Dominion jurisdiction, has jurisdiction over the company in order to remedy the discrimination. Elimination of the discrimination in the manner provided in the order involves, however, the exercise by the Board of jurisdiction over part of the Central Park Line, which is under provincial jurisdiction. If it be correct, as already stated, that the Board has jurisdiction over the company only in reference to its operation of the railway under Dominion jurisdiction and by virtue of that situation acquires no jurisdiction over the purely provincial railway that it also happens to operate as owner, it follows that the order, in directing this appellant to publish a joint tariff \u201cvia direct connection between the companies,\u201d that is, over the one mile of the Central Park line, is an attempted exercise of a jurisdiction over that one mile which the Board does not possess.\nThe remedies pointed out in the Montreal Street Railway case[7] of course exist here also. The Legislature of the Province of British Columbia has power to coerce the owners of the provincial line to enter into the necessary agreement, and the Dominion Parliament may end the difficulty by declaring the Park line of the appellants to be for the general advantage of Canada. It is contended, however, on behalf of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, that action of this kind, like the order appealed from, would be unjust to that company, in view of the fact that it constructed its line into the territory and is entitled to an advantage in securing traffic from that territory, and should not be compelled to hand over, for the long haul, traffic secured there, within a short distance of its origin, to a rival company. What action, therefore, the Legislature or Parliament should take under the circumstances is a matter of policy, and both bodies may view the situation as one not calling for any remedy.\nFurther, it is admitted that there is an indirect connection between the Vancouver & Lulu Island Railway and the Canadian National Railway lines by way of Canadian Pacific Railway lines, over all of which lines the Board has jurisdiction.\nThe construction, under Dominion authority, of a connecting link between the Canadian National Railway lines and the Vancouver & Lulu Island Railway lines by Dominion authority would also furnish jurisdiction over the matter in dispute. In any event, for the reasons stated, I am of opinion that the Board had not jurisdiction to make the order appealed against, and that question 1 submitted must be answered in the negative, rendering it unnecessary to answer question 2.\nCosts will be to the appellants.\nCannon J. (dissenting).\u2014I have had the advantage of perusing the notes of my brother Smith in this case. They contain a full statement of the facts. I will simply give the reasons why, with great deference, I cannot agree with his conclusions. The case presents this peculiar situation: the appellant, the British Columbia Electric Railway Company, contests the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament and of the Railway Board over it, claiming that its works and operations are within the legislative ambit of the provincial Legislature, while the Attorney-General of British Columbia, the natural guardian of the rights and prerogatives of this province, takes before us the stand that the Dominion jurisdiction should be affirmed. This attitude of the provincial authorities is explained, to my mind, by the fact that the appellant company is neither a provincial nor a federal company, but an English corporation authorized or licensed to do business in British Columbia. It seems to me that the question involved in this appeal is not a conflict of jurisdiction between the Legislature and the Dominion parliament, but purely and simply the validity of the enactment by the Dominion Parliament of section 6 (a) of the Railway Act, which reads as follows:\n6. The provisions of this Act shall, without limiting the effect of the last preceding section, extend and apply to\n(a) every railway company incorporated elsewhere than in. Canada and owning, controlling, operating or running trains or rolling stock upon or over any line or lines of railway in Canada either owned, controlled, leased or operated by such company or companies, whether in either case such ownership, control, or operation is acquired by purchase, lease, agreement or by any other means whatsoever.\nAlthough the British Columbia Electric Railway Company is licensed to carry on its business within the province of British Columbia, with one Johannes Charles Martin Buntzen, as attorney for the company, it is nevertheless a company incorporated elsewhere than in Canada with power to acquire, as a going concern, and it has acquired not only the franchise, rights, powers and privileges of the Consoli- dated Railway Company, but it is admitted also that, at all material times, it operated street railways and inter-urban services in and around Vancouver and it owned, controlled, operated and ran trains and rolling stock upon and over the lines of the Vancouver & Lulu Island Railway\u2014which is a federal railway.\nThe appellant, plainly and without any possible ambiguity, falls, therefore, under the wording and operation of section 6 (a) of the Railway Act.\nIs this section intra vires of Parliament?\nUsing the words of Mr. Justice Mabee in the case of Stewart et al v. Napierville Junction Railway Company[8], where he gives the history of this section, originally 8-9 Edw. VII, ch. 32,1 would say,\nIn cases where a line of railway has passed into foreign hands; when it has either been sold out and out, and become absorbed, if you will, and forms part of the foreign line, or where it has been leased; or where it is operated by the foreign road; or where the foreign road has obtained control of the stock; or, where it has obtained control of that road by any means whatsoever, parliament, we presume, thought, being international matters, that Federal control should apply.\nThis decision has not been challenged, although it would appear from the report that time was given to apply for leave to appeal to this Court. It has been acted upon and considered as good law for the last twenty years. See MacMurchy & Denison, Railway Law of Canada, 1922, p. 25. In law, a company incorporated and having its head-office in England must be considered as foreign to Canada; if it enters Canada to engage in the railway business it must submit to certain rules for its conduct in Canada. The Insurance cases, especially the last decision of the Privy Council, delivered on the 22nd of October, 1931[9], cannot apply to railway legislation, which is always of public or semi-public character, while the insurance business is a matter of civil rights and contract which has been declared in Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General for Alberta[10], to be exclusively subject to provincial law. Reasons of general national interest, to my mind, should give and give to the Dominion parliament, through the Railway Board, control and regulation of foreign companies owning and operating railways anywhere in Canada, even if their operations or works be confined for a time to one province. Railway works, when owned by a foreign company, cannot be considered as merely local, as they may affect our international or inter-imperial relations and, possibly, the defence of the country or the plans of the federal government for the use of the railway for a possible mobilization of troops, either in peace or in war time; provisions to regulate them are necessarily incidental to effective Dominion legislation concerning railways. See remark of Lord Dunedin in Grand Trunk Ry. Co. of Canada v. Attorney-General of Canada[11]. For instance, is it not a matter of general national concern that a majority of the directors of a foreign company owning or controlling a railway in Canada should be British subjects, as provided for in section 113, para. 3, of our Railway Act? This is a matter of national, not provincial, policy, and only the Governor in Council can permit otherwise. I would therefore answer the questions as follows:\n\u201c1. Had the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, under the circumstances of this case, jurisdiction under the Railway Act to issue Order No. 42808 in so far as it directs the British Columbia Electric Railway Company Limited to publish and file joint rates between stations on the Vancouver and Lulu Island Railway and points on the Canadian National Railway via direct connection between the British Columbia Electric Railway Company Limited and the Canadian National Railway?\u201d\nAnswer: Yes.\n\u201c2. If the above question should be answered in the affirmative, had the Parliament of Canada jurisdiction to confer upon the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada authority to compel the British Columbia Electric Railway Company Limited to publish such joint rates over the route in question?\u201d\nAnswer: Yes. The costs of the appeal should be borne by the British Columbia Electric Railway Company.\nQuestion No. 1 answered in the negative; therefore unnecessary to answer question No. 2.

Newcombe J. took no part in the judgment, as he died before the delivery thereof.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nMortgage\u2014Agency\u2014Loan on security of mortgage on land\u2014Loan required to pay off prior mortgage\u2014Lender paying proceeds of loan to solicitor for prior mortgagee\u2014Authorization\u2014Misappropriation by solicitor\u2014Forged discharge of prior mortgage\u2014Responsibility for loss\u2014Validity of mortgage to secure the loan, as against the mortgagor and subsequent purchaser of the land.\nAppellant sued upon a mortgage assigned to her by C. to whom it had been made with the object of finding a person to lend the money with which to pay off an overdue mortgage on the land to Y. for whom C. acted as solicitor; said method being adopted to avoid delay when a lender was found, the mortgagor being away on a visit. H., who in the mortgagor\u2019s absence had attended for him to the business of Y.\u2019s mortgage, interviewed appellant, who agreed to lend the money, and, as directed by H. (whether, in this regard, H. acted as agent for the mortgagor or for appellant was in dispute), made her cheque payable to C., and (through a solicitor, O.) took from C. and registered a purported discharge of the Y. mortgage, the mortgage in question and C.\u2019s assignment thereof to appellant. It was found later that the discharge of the Y. mortgage was a forgery, and that Y. did not receive the money from C.\nHeld: Upon the correspondence and facts in evidence, C. was authorized by the mortgagor to receive the money, and H., in directing appellant to make her cheque payable to C., was acting for the mortgagor; the receipt and cashing of the cheque by C. completed the loan as between the mortgagor and appellant, and the registration of the mortgage constituted it a valid security on the land as against the mortgagor and the respondent (a subsequent purchaser of the land). Even assuming that knowledge that appellant\u2019s loan was to be used to pay off the mortgage to Y. must be attributed to appellant by reason of information conveyed by H. to the solicitor, O., who (acting, as found, for both appellant and the mortgagor) attended to searching title and putting through the loan, yet such knowledge was only that C., the authorized agent of the mortgagor to receive the proceeds of the loan, was to apply them on the Y. mortgage. While O. owed a duty, both to appellant and to the mortgagor, to see that the title was clear, yet any negligence in that respect was a question between him and them and had nothing to do with the question of C.\u2019s right to receive the money as the person authorized by the mortgagor to receive it. The situation was the same as if the mortgagor himself had received the money; and the argument that no consideration had passed from C. to the mortgagor, and that appellant, buying the mortgage, was bound by the state of the mortgage account, was, in the circumstances, untenable.\nMurray v.

(ibid) restored.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], which (reversing the judgment of Garrow J.[2]) held that the mortgage in question was not a valid and subsisting mortgage.\nThe mortgage in question had been made by the defendant Jannetta (his wife joining to bar dower) to one Campbell, who was acting as solicitor for Mrs. Young who held a prior mortgage on the land. The mortgage to Mrs. Young was overdue and required to be paid. Jannetta, the mortgagor, was in Italy at the time, and, to facilitate the raising of a loan from a lender to be found and paying off therewith Mrs. Young\u2019s mortgage without delay, a mortgage was made to Campbell, with the object of assigning it to the person, to be found, who would advance the money. One, Hook, had been looking after the land for Jannetta in the latter\u2019s absence and had been corresponding with him in regard to the arrears on Mrs. Young\u2019s mortgage. Hook interviewed the plaintiff (appellant) who agreed to make the advance. As found by this Court on the evidence, Hook, acting for Jannetta, told the plaintiff to make her cheque payable to Campbell, which she did; (the question of agency in this regard was in dispute and was found upon differently in the Appellate Division, which held that Hook was acting as the plaintiff\u2019s agent on this occasion, and advised her to make the cheque payable to Campbell). Campbell executed an assignment of the mortgage in question to the plaintiff and also produced a discharge of Mrs. Young\u2019s mortgage, which discharge was later (in an action brought by Mrs. Young on her mortgage) found to be a forgery. Mrs. Young never received the money. The purported discharge of Mrs. Young\u2019s mortgage, the mortgage in question and the assignment thereof from Campbell were registered. The respondent (defendant) company was a subsequent purchaser of the land from Jannetta. A fuller statement of the facts in certain respects is given in the judgment now reported.\nThe plaintiff brought action on the mortgage. Garrow J[3] held that it was a valid and subsisting mortgage, subject only to the prior mortgage to Mrs. Young, and gave judgment accordingly. His judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division[4], which held that the mortgage in question was not a valid and subsisting mortgage. The plaintiff appealed to this Court. By the judgment of this Court, now reported, the plaintiff\u2019s appeal was allowed with costs here and in the Appellate Division, and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nW.N. Tilley K.C. and J.C. McRuer K.C. for the appellant.\nJ.M. Bullen for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSMITH J.\u2014This is an action by plaintiff, appellant, to recover $6,125 and interest thereon due on a certain mortgage made by defendants Domenick Jannetta and his wife Nicoletta Jannetta to one John A. Campbell, assigned by him to the appellant, and for foreclosure of the mortgage.\nPrior to 1924, the defendant D. Jannetta went to Italy, leaving his affairs in reference to the premises covered by the mortgage in the hands of one Thomas Hook, a real estate agent in Toronto.\nThe property in question was at this time subject to a mortgage for $6,125 to one Mrs. Georgina Chilcott Young. E.W. Owens, a Toronto solicitor, had been Jannetta\u2019s legal adviser up to the time the latter left for Italy, and in October, 1924, was in correspondence with Jannetta in reference to arrears of interest due on Mrs. Young\u2019s mortgage.\nOn 23rd March, 1925, John A. Campbell, the solicitor mentioned above, wrote Owens that he had instructions from Mrs. Young to put the property up for sale unless the interest was paid. Owens sent a copy of this letter to Hook, and correspondence between Hook and Campbell followed. Hook cabled Jannetta that the property was to be put up at auction, and requested that $300 be cabled to him; and in the meantime gave Campbell his own cheque for $200, and obtained a postponement of the sale for two weeks.\nOn April 20th, Jannetta wrote to Hook, requesting him to try to sell the property.\nThe $300 was cabled to Hook, who subsequently paid to Campbell $309.63 and $2.50, the balance, after crediting the $200, owing for interest and costs, as shewn by Campbell\u2019s statement sent to Hook on May 6th, 1925, for which amount a receipt is endorsed on the back of the statement, signed by Campbell, per \u201cE.F.\u201d\nOn May 7th, 1925, Hook wrote to Jannetta, giving him full information as to the above facts, and informing him that all interest was paid up to the 24th of March, 1925, and that the next payment of interest would be due on the 24th of October next. He goes on to say that Mrs. Young now wants her mortgage paid off, and that he is trying to secure someone who will lend the necessary money on the property, and that when he succeeds, the necessary papers will be sent, so that the new mortgage will pay off the old one. He explains that the Young mortgage is past due, so that a new mortgage is necessary.\nOn the 19th of May, 1925, Campbell wrote a letter to Hook, enclosing a mortgage drawn from Jannetta and his wife to himself for $6,125, with interest at 7 per cent., which was signed by Jannetta and his wife, and which is the mortgage now in question. The letter asks Hook to send the mortgage to Jannetta with instructions to have it executed and returned, and continues as follows:\nAlso have him give you a letter with instructions to pay over the money received from this mortgage to Mrs. Chilcott Young so that she can be paid off at once. This matter must be completed and the money in the hands of Mrs. Young by the 15th day of June, otherwise I will continue the mortgage sale proceedings and your client will lose his property.\nOn the same day, Hook wrote Jannetta as follows:\nDear Mr. Jannetta:\nEnclosed find a letter from Mr. Campbell who is solicitor for Mrs. Young, the mortgagee, which speaks for itself, and I also enclose you a mortgage and duplicate made out in his name for $6,125 and the proceeds of this mortgage when sold is to be applied on the present mortgage held by Mrs. Young and this is the only way that I can see to meet the demands as the present mortgage has expired and cannot be sold.\nHe goes on to give instructions about the execution of the mortgage, and then continues as follows:\n* * * return them to me by return mail and send the necessary written authority for the proceeds of this mortgage to be credited to the present mortgage and in this way we may get the whole matter cleaned up for another five years.\nOn June 11th, 1925, Jannetta cabled Hook as follows: \u201cMortgage is coming\u201d; and the mortgage was received by Hook in due course.\nHere we have a proposal by Hook to Jannetta that he, Hook, is trying to negotiate on Jannetta\u2019s behalf for a new loan, followed by a proposal by Campbell and Hook to Jannetta that this new loan should be obtained by the execution of the mortgage and its sale. The acceptance of these proposals by Jannetta, by the execution of the mortgage, its return and the cablegram, was an express acceptance of the whole proposition set out in these letters, that is, an express authority to Campbell and Hook to obtain a loan by securing a purchaser of the mortgage and to receive and apply the proceeds on the Young mortgage. Hook interviewed the appellant on Jannetta\u2019s behalf to get a loan in the manner agreed to by Jannetta, and we have therefore two parties negotiating for and finally entering into a bargain for the purchase of the mortgage, one of them being Jannetta by his agent Hook, and the other the appellant. If Jannetta had been there himself instead of Hook, the situation would have been the same. The appellant and her brother were taken by Hook to inspect the property, and Hook told them that the property was good security, a mere representation on behalf of Jannetta that Jannetta himself would have made. Hook knew the property before going to the appellant, and would not expect to get the loan otherwise than by representing it as a good one. To convince the appellant of the truth of this representation, he took her and her brother to see the property, just as Jannetta himself would have done had he been there to act for himself. If the appellant was constituting Hook her agent to value the property, and was trusting to his valuation, there was no need for her and her brother to look at the property at all.\nThe verbal bargain for the loan was concluded by the appellant agreeing to take it. Campbell was in fact authorized by Jannetta, as stated, to receive the money, and Hook, acting for Jannetta, told the appellant to make the cheque payable to Campbell, which she did. The receipt and cashing of the cheque by Campbell completed the loan as between Jannetta and the subsequent purchaser, the respondent, the Toronto Wine Manufacturing Company, Limited.\nOwens had previously been solicitor for both the appellant and Jannetta; and Hook, knowing this, and with the appellant\u2019s assent, engaged Owens to look after searching the title and putting through the loan, and there is no doubt that, in attending to this business, Owens was acting for both the appellant and Jannetta, as it was Jannetta who paid him for these services. After getting the appellant\u2019s assent that Owens should act in the matter, Hook wrote to Owens the letter, exhibit no. 4. which is as follows: 79 Victoria Street,\nToronto, 24th June, 1925.\nE.W.J. OWENS Esq., K.C.,\n32 Adelaide St. E.,\nCity.\nRe: No. 1682 Queen Street W.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014\nMrs. Livingston is buying a mortgage given by Dominick Jannetta to John A. Campbell for $6,125 for five years from the 15th May last, with interest at 7 per cent. per annum, payable half yearly, covering the above property and the proceeds of this mortgage is to be used for paying off a previous mortgage for $6,125 given by Jannetta to Mrs. Chillcott Young, which mortgage is past due; and when the necessary papers are executed and the title found satisfactory, I will give you the necessary cheque for the said amount.\nYours very truly,\n(Sgd.) T. HOOK.\nP.S.\u2014Mr. John A. Campbell, 24 King St. W. (Ad. 0246), is the solicitor with whom you can communicate.\nIt is argued that because of the statement in this letter that the proceeds were to be used for payment off of the previous mortgage to Mrs.Young, this knowledge, conveyed to Owens, must be attributed to the appellant, for whom he was acting. Assuming that to be so, it amounts only to knowledge on the part of the appellant that Campbell, the authorized agent of Jannetta to receive the proceeds of the loan, was to apply them on the Young mortgage. It was, of course, Owens\u2019 duty, both to the appellant, and to Jannetta, to see that the title was clear, but if he was negligent in that respect, it is a question between him and them, and has nothing to do with the question of Campbell\u2019s right to receive the money as Jannetta\u2019s authorized agent.\nMr. Bullen, in an able and exhaustive argument, presented everything that I think could be offered on behalf of the respondents, and cited a number of cases upon which he placed strong reliance. An examination of these cases, however, discloses that they have no application to the facts of this case. The argument that no consideration had passed from Campbell to Jannetta, and that the appellant, buying the mortgage, is bound by the state of the mortgage account, is surely not tenable. The appellant purchased the mortgage from the mortgagor and paid over the purchase money to the very party authorized by Jannetta to receive it, so that the situation is as if Jannetta himself had received the money. In the case of Murray v. Crossland[5], a solicitor received the mortgage moneys from the mortgagee, the intention, as found by the learned trial judge, of all parties being that the money should be paid in satisfaction of a prior mortgage. The solicitor misapplied the funds, and it was held that the mortgage was not a valid security for the amount, upon the express finding of fact by the learned judge that the solicitor did not receive the moneys as agent of the mortgagors.\nButwick v. Grant[6], is cited as authority for the proposition that an agent with authority to sell has no implied authority to receive the money. The case is authority for the proposition that a purchaser is justified in paying the purchase price of goods to an agent who sells them for a principal only when the agent has express authority, ostensible authority or customary authority; and that the question of authority must be determined from the facts of each particular case. There the agent got an order for goods by sample, and the principal shipped the goods and posted the invoice under his own name. Later, the agent called and collected the price, and it was held that under those circumstances there was no ostensible authority. The case is quite different where a principal entrusts the possession of his goods to an agent to sell and to hand them over to a purchaser. In the present case the mortgage was placed in the hands of Campbell and Hook by Jannetta for the express purpose of selling it and for the express purpose of transferring it to a purchaser and receiving and applying the money.\nThe appeal must be allowed, with costs here and in the Appellate Division, and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McRuer, Evan Gray, Mason & Cameron.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Arthur S. Winchester.\n[1] [1931] O.R. 325.\n[2] ibid, at 327-331.\n[3] [1931] O.R. 325, at 327-331.\n[4] [1931] O.R. 325.\n[5] (1929) 64 Ont. L.R. 403.\n[6] [1924] 2 KB. 483.\n"}

Attorney-General, [1931] 2 Ch. 370, discussed).\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] dismissing his appeal from the judgment of Orde J.A.[2] dismissing the action, upon motion made by the defendant in weekly court. The action was for damages for alleged defamatory statements made by defendant. The words spoken were (as found by the court on the pleadings and admissions in plaintiff\u2019s particulars and examination for discovery) spoken during the course of certain proceedings which defendant was conducting as commissioner appointed by letters patent under the Great Seal of Canada, by the Governor General, under the authority of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 26, and of the Enquiries Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 99. Defendant\u2019s motion before Orde, J.A., to dismiss the action was made on the ground that the statement of claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action or that the action was frivolous or vexatious, in that the defendant was absolutely privileged on the occasion in which it was alleged he spoke the words complained of. Orde, J.A., dismissed the action on the ground that the proceedings before the defendant were absolutely privileged, and his judgment was upheld by the Appellate Division.\nThe appellant in person.\nH.H. Davis K.C. and D.G. Farquharson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nSMITH J.\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiff from a judgment of the First Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[3], upholding, by a majority of four to one, the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Orde[4], dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action upon motion in weekly court, on the ground that the defence of absolute privilege was clearly sound.\nThe first ground of appeal is that there were relevant and material issues of fact outstanding and undetermined, making it improper to dispose of the case in weekly court on motion.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Orde that the pleadings and the admissions made by the plaintiff in the particulars furnished by him and on his examination for discovery, made it quite clear that the words were spoken by the defendant during the course of certain proceedings which he was conducting as a commissioner appointed by letters patent under the Great Seal of Canada, by the Governor General, under the authority of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C., 1927, ch. 26, and of the Enquiries Act, R.S.C., 1927, ch. 99.\nThe only question to be determined, therefore, was one of law as to whether or not the commissioner so acting was entitled to absolute privilege. For this reason the motion was properly entertained by the learned judge.\nA very full discussion of the law on the question at issue, with a review of the cases applicable, appears in the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Orde on the motion and in the reasons of Mr. Justice Middleton in the Appellate Division. I agree with their reasons and conclusions and would only add to what they have said a reference to the case of Hearts of Oak Assurance Company, Limited v. Attorney General[5], decided since the judgment herein of the Appellate Division.\nIn that case the Industrial Insurance Commissioner, as authorized by s. 17 of the Industrial Insurance Act, 1923, appointed Mr. John Fox inspector to examine into and report on the affairs of the plaintiff company. This section authorizes the commissioner to make such appointment, if, in his opinion, there is reasonable cause to believe that an offence against this Act or certain other Acts has been, or is likely to be committed. The inspector is given power to examine into and report on the affairs of the society or company, and for that purpose to exercise in respect of the society or company all or any of the powers given by subs. 5 of sec. 76 of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, to an inspector under that section, which reads as follows:\nAn inspector appointed under this section may require the production of all or any of the books or documents of the society, and may examine on oath its officers, members, agents and servants in relation to its business, and may administer such oath accordingly.\nOn receiving the report of the inspector, the commissioner may issue such directions and take such steps as he considers necessary or proper to deal with the situation disclosed, and may, in case of a society, award that the society be dissolved and its affairs wound up, and in case of a company, may present a petition to the court for the winding up of the company. The question at issue was as to whether or not the inspector was entitled to conduct his examination in public, as he proposed to do.\nLuxmoore J. decided that, on the true construction of the Act, the inspection may be held at the discretion of the commissioner, either in public or in private, or partly in public and partly in private, and was upheld by the Court of Appeal, Lord Hanworth, M.R., dissenting.\nIt was argued that the inspection was a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding, and therefore must be held in public on the principle laid down in Scott v. Scott[6]. Luxmoore J. and the majority of the judges in the Court of Appeal (Lawrence and Romer, LJJ.) held that it was unnecessary to determine this question, but Lawrence, L.J., states that, in his opinion, there is a good deal to be said for the contention of the Attorney General that an inspection under s. 17 is in the nature of a judicial enquiry because of the powers given the commissioner as a result of it.\nLord Hanworth in his dissenting judgment says that if the hearing was a judicial proceeding he would follow the principle laid down in Scott v. Scott6. He refers to a number of proceedings that have been held to be of a judicial nature carrying immunity in respect of reports of the proceedings, and cites a number of cases, including some of those cited in the reasons of Mr. Justice Orde and Mr. Justice Middleton. He points out that in Barratt v. Kearns[7] it was the duty of the commissioners to hear evidence of both sides and then report, and that in Dawkins v. Lord Rokeby[8] full opportunity was to be afforded to the officer or soldier of being present at the enquiry, of making any statement, of cross-examining witnesses and of offering evidence. After stating that in both those cases there was provided opportunity for both sides to be heard and for their evidence to be considered, he goes on to say that there is no difficulty in attaching a judicial character to such tribunals. He then alludes to the fact that the inspector was not given power to compel witnesses to answer, and concludes that the proceedings of the inspector were not of a judicial character.\nIn the Acts under which the commissioner was appointed in the present case, he is given the most ample powers for compelling witnesses to attend and to answer questions on oath and to compel the production of documents; and there is provision that parties whose conduct is being investigated, or against whom charges are made, are to be given opportunity to be present and to be heard and to be represented by counsel.\nWhat is said, therefore, in Hearts of Oak Assurance Company Limited v. Attorney-General[9] seems to be rather in support of than against the judgment here appealed from.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

V, c. 23).\nG. Co. in 1923-1924 adopted, put into use, and caused to be registered in Canada, the word \u201cZipper\u201d as a specific trade-mark in connection with footwear, and has since sold under it overshoes equipped with slide fasteners, The slide fasteners were manufactured by L. Co. which supplied all of them that were so used by G. Co. In 1927 L. Co. applied for registration of the word \u201cZipper\u201d as a specific trademark in connection with the sale of slide fasteners. Subsequently G. Co. applied for registration of the word as a specific trade-mark in connection with the sale of slide fasteners and all articles containing the same. The Commissioner of Patents refused both applications, notifying the parties that, in view of certain conflicting applications, no further action could be taken \u201cuntil the rights of the different parties have been determined either by mutual agreement or by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d L. Co. then petitioned in the Exchequer Court, and G. Co. (objecting party) counter petitioned, each for an order for registration as applied for. Maclean J. ([1931] Ex. CR. 90) dismissed both petitions, holding that the word had become descriptive of slide fasteners in such degree as to preclude its registration as a trade-mark. Both parties appealed, both contending that the judgment below was made upon an issue not properly before the court, and that, in any case, the evidence was insufficient to support the holding, and each claiming an exclusive right to the use of the word for its purpose as applied for.\nHeld (1): It was within the competence of the Exchequer Court (and of this Court on appeal) to pass upon said ground taken in the judgment below. On proceedings such as those taken in this case, the court has jurisdiction to enquire into all reasons wherefor, under the Trade Mark and Design Act, the registration should be permitted or refused; its powers are co-extensive with those conferred on the Minister in s. 11, and (in the absence of surprise to the parties) its investigation should cover the same field (s. 45 of said Act cited and discussed; also s. 22 of the Exchequer Court Act, as amended by 18-19 Geo. V, c. 23). (Quaere whether, on a reference by the Minister to the Exchequer Court under s. 12 of the Trade Mark and Design Act, the court\u2019s jurisdiction may not be limited to the determination of the question involved in the reference).\n(2): The evidence, however, was not such as to establish that, at the time of the applications in question, the word \u201cZipper\u201d had become descriptive, so as to justify refusal of registration on that ground.\nTo deny registration of a word on the ground that it is descriptive, it must appear that, at the date of the application, it was a name, in current use, descriptive of the article itself.\n(3): G. Co.\u2019s petition should be refused. A specific trade-mark can only be registered \u201cin connection with the sale of a class merchandise of a particular description\u201d (s. 4 (c)); and the \u201cmerchandise of a particular description\u201d which G. Co. sold was an overshoe, not the fastener with which it was equipped; nor did G. Co. indicate any present intention of manufacturing or selling slide fasteners separately (Batt & Co.\u2019s Trade Marks, 15 R.P.C. 262 and 534 (at 538), [1899] A.C. 428; Bayer Co. v. American Druggists\u2019 Syndicate, [1924] Can. S.C.R. 558, at 569-570; Pugsley, Dingman & Co. v. Proctor & Gamble Co., [1929] Can. S.C.R. 442, at 448, referred to in this connection). Further, although G. Co. had used and registered the word in connection with footwear, it had never used it in connection with fasteners (and the exclusive right to a mark is restricted to the class of goods to which it has been attached: Somerville v. Schembri, 12 App. Cas. 453); and its application for registration was posterior to that of L. Co. Also its application to register the mark in connection with \u201call articles containing\u201d slide fasteners should be refused by reason of the confusion which, on the evidence (which showed that slide fasteners are or may be used on a great number of goods of all classes), would otherwise result; (quaere whether, under the Act, a request in that form for a specific trade-mark may be entertained at all).\n(4): L. Co.\u2019s petition should also be refused. In view of the long and extensive use of the word by G. Co. in connection with overshoes, of the existence of certain other marks on the Register, and of the wide variety of goods to which the fasteners were or might be attached, confusion would likely have resulted had the mark been allowed. To justify refusal of registration it is sufficient that the mark might have the effect of deceiving the public (Eno v. Dunn, 15 App. Cas. 252, at 257). L. Co.\u2019s adoption of the word as a mark for slide fasteners came too late in the word\u2019s history.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court (supra), in its result, affirmed.\nCROSS-APPEALS taken independently by each of the parties from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], refusing the petition of each party for an order directing registration of the word \u201cZipper\u201d as a specific trade-mark.\nIn 1923-1924, the B. F. Goodrich Company (a corporation of the State of New York, U.S.A.) adopted and put into use the word \u201cZipper\u201d as applied to footwear manufactured by it, which footwear was equipped with a separable fastener of the slide controlled type (the fastener itself was not manufactured by it). In February, 1924, it obtained in Canada registration of the word \u201cZipper\u201d as a specific trade-mark to be applied to the sale of footwear. This was assigned, in January, 1925, to the Canadian Goodrich Company, Ltd. (hereinafter called the \u201cGoodrich Co.\u201d) which has since carried on the Goodrich business in Canada, which business has included the manufacture of overshoes equipped with slide fasteners under the trade-mark \u201cZipper.\u201d The Goodrich Co. never manufactured the slide fasteners themselves, but purchased them from the Lightning Fastener Company Ltd. (hereinafter called the \u201cLightning Co.\u201d) which manufactured them and supplied to the Goodrich Co. all that were used by the latter in its footwear as aforesaid.\nIn October, 1927, the Lightning Co. applied for registration of the word \u201cZipper\u201d as a specific trade-mark to be used in connection with the sale of separable fasteners, particularly of the slide-controlled type. Subsequently the Goodrich Co. applied for registration of the word \u201cZipper\u201d as a general trade-mark, which application was refused, and the Goodrich Co. later applied for registration of the word as a specific trade-mark to be used in connection with the manufacture and sale of slide fasteners and articles containing same.\nOn March 14, 1929, the Commissioner of Patents wrote a letter to each of the parties, in which, after referring to certain conflicting applications, he stated that \u201cno further action can be taken\u201d thereon \u201cuntil the rights of the different parties have been determined either by mutual agreement or by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d\nOn March 12, 1930, the Lightning Co. filed a petition in the Exchequer Court of Canada, praying for an order for registration of its trade-mark \u201cZipper\u201d as a specific trademark to be used in connection with the manufacture and sale of separable fasteners. The Goodrich Co. filed its statement of objection, in which, by way of counter petition, it prayed for a declaration that it is exclusively entitled to the use of the word \u201cZipper\u201d as a trade-mark for slide fasteners and articles equipped therewith, and for a direction to the Commissioner of Patents to act upon its application.\nMaclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[2], refused both the petition and counter petition, holding that the word \u201cZipper\u201d had become descriptive of slide fasteners in such degree as to preclude its registration as a trade-mark.\nBoth parties appealed, the Lightning Co. from that part of the judgment which refused registration of its trademark \u201cZipper\u201d as a specific trade-mark to be used in connection with the manufacture and sale of separable fasteners, and the Goodrich Co. from that part which refused registration of its trade-mark \u201cZipper\u201d as a specific trademark in connection with the sale of slide fasteners and articles containing the same.\nHarold G. Fox for the Lightning Fastener Co. Ltd.\nR. S. Smart K.C. for the Canadian Goodrich Co. Ltd. Anglin C.J.C.\u2014I would dismiss the appeal and cross-appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nRinfret J.\u2014These are cross-appeals taken independently by each of the parties from the judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court[3], refusing to order the registration by either party of the word \u201cZipper\u201d as a specific trade-mark for separable fasteners of the slide-controlled type referred to as slide fasteners. The latter may be described as devices consisting, of two opposite series of members adapted to be attached one on each side of an aperture in some article and to interlock so as to close the aperture upon the slide being operated in one direction, or to separate so as to leave the aperture open upon the slide being operated in the opposite direction.\nThe proceedings originated by way of petition to the Exchequer Court praying that an order may be made directing the registration of the trade-mark in the name of the Lightning Fastener Company Ltd. to be used in connection with the manufacture and sale of separable fasteners of the type in question. The Canadian Goodrich Company Ltd. was the Objecting Party, and, in its statement of objection, it also petitioned for the registration of the trade-mark in connection with similar goods.\nThe learned judge dismissed both applications. His decision was that, subsequently to its use and registration as a trade-mark by the Goodrich Company on overshoes equipped with slide fasteners, the word \u201cZipper\u201d had become descriptive of slide fasteners generally and was, therefore, no longer a proper mark for registration.\nBoth parties appeal. They join in asking that the judgment be set aside because, as they contend, the adjudication was made upon an issue not properly before the court and as to which, at all events, the evidence was quite insufficient to support the conclusion of the learned judge. But, after having thus jointly enunciated their grounds of attack upon the judgment, the parties separate, and each of them prays for a declaration that it is exclusively entitled to the use of the word \u201cZipper\u201d as a trade-mark.\nThe question of the competency of the Exchequer Court in the premises must first receive our attention.\nThe point comes up in this way:\nThere being several applications for the registration of the word \u201cZipper\u201d pending before the Commissioner of Patents, he notified each party that \u201cno further action (could) be taken on any of the above noted conflicting trade-mark applications until the rights of the different parties (had) been determined either by mutual agreement or by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d\nThe point raised by the appellants is that conflict was therefore the only question in controversy and upon that question alone was the Exchequer Court competent to adjudicate.\nUnder the Trade Mark and Design Act, the Minister named by the Governor in Council to administer the Act may refuse to register a trade-mark in any of certain cases enumerated in sec. 11, and conflict is one of them. In such cases, the Minister may also, if he thinks fit, \u201crefer the matter to the Exchequer Court of Canada\u201d and, says sec. 12,\nin that event, such court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter, and to make an order determining whether and subject to what conditions, if any, registration is to be permitted.\nIt may be argued\u2014and with some force\u2014that when the case is brought before the Exchequer Court in the form just described, the jurisdiction of that court is limited to the determination of the question involved in the reference. That question only, it may be said, is the subject-matter of the reference and it alone is \u201cthe matter\u201d which the court \u201cshall have jurisdiction to hear and determine.\u201d\nBut such is not the case that we have before us. The Minister made no reference. He simply left it to the different parties to decide upon their own course to have their rights adjusted. One of them, the Lightning Company, instituted the present proceedings. They are proceedings by way of petition complaining that the petitioner\u2019s application was, without sufficient cause, refused by the Minister. In proceedings of that kind, the parties apply to the court for relief notwithstanding that the matter has not been referred to the court by the Minister. This they may do under sec 45 of the Act (See In re \u201cVulcan\u201d Trade Mark[4]), but they should express no surprise if, under the circumstances, they do not find themselves in exactly the same position as if there had been a reference. While it may be that, upon the bare words, section 12 is susceptible of being construed as conferring only a limited jurisdiction, as to which the present case does not call for our opinion, the same may not be said of sec. 45, which reads as follows:\n45. The Exchequer Court of Canada may, on the information of the Attorney-General, or at the suit of any person aggrieved by any omission, without sufficient cause, to make any entry in the register of trade-marks or in the register of industrial designs, or by any entry made without sufficient cause in any register, make such order for making, expunging or varying any entry in any such register as the Court thinks fit; or the Court may refuse the application.\n2. In either case, the Court may make such order with respect to the costs of the proceedings as the Court thinks fit.\n3. The Court may in any proceedings under this section, decide any question that may be necessary or expedient to decide for the rectification of any such register.\nWe can see no limitation, such as is suggested, in the language of this section. The court may make such order as it thinks fit, or it may refuse the application; and, for that purpose, it has jurisdiction to inquire into all the reasons wherefor, under the Act, the entry in the register should be permitted or should be refused. The intention appears, in any of the cases contemplated by sec. 45, to import into the section all the provisions of sec. 11, so that, in the relevant litigation, the powers of the court are coextensive with those conferred on the Minister in Sec. 11 and the court, mutatis mutandis, stands in the position of the Minister.\nIf it were necessary, resort may be had to sec. 22 of the Exchequer Court Act, as introduced in 1928 by c. 23 of 18-19 George V:\n22. The Exchequer Court shall have jurisdiction as well between subject and subject as otherwise,\n(a) in all cases of conflicting applications for any patent of invention, or for the registration of any copyright, trade-mark or industrial design;\n(b) in all cases in which it is sought to impeach or annul any patent of invention, or to have any entry in any register of copyrights, trade-marks or industrial designs made, expunged, varied or rectified; and (\u0441) in all other cases in which a remedy is sought under the authority of any Act of the Parliament of Canada or at Common Law or in Equity, respecting any patent of invention, copyright, trademark, or industrial design.\nBy the above section, the jurisdiction is conferred in broad and general terms. Both under that section and under sec. 45 of the Trade Mark and Design Act, the jurisdiction of the court is not limited to the points invoked in the Minister\u2019s ruling, and the whole case is properly and competently before the court.\nOf course, as the appellants contend, the rule remains that the adjudication must be confined to the issues to which the trial was directed, but the real issue is whether the mark is a proper one for registration; and it should not be forgotten that legislation concerning patents, trademarks and the like exists primarily in the interest and for the protection of the public, so much so that it could be said that the public is a third party to all patent or trade-mark litigation. For that reason, when applied to those cases, the rule should receive the widest and most liberal interpretation. After all, the court may not give a final order for making an entry in the register of trade-marks, unless it be satisfied that the applicant is undoubtedly entitled to the exclusive use of the mark and that the mark is not in any way objectionable under one or the other of the sections of the Act, more particularly section 11; and it is for the applicant to satisfy the court in these respects. We fail to see why the court\u2019s investigation should not cover the same field as that of the Commissioner or the Minister, provided always the parties are not taken by surprise.\nWe do not therefore agree with the appellants\u2019 contention that the judgment proceeded on a point which was not before the court. As already said, the learned President refused the applications because, in his opinion, the word \u201cZipper\u201d was descriptive and was not accordingly a proper mark for registration. It cannot be doubted that, in the present proceedings, the Exchequer Court was competent to pass upon that ground of objection, nor that the applicants were amply advised, by the course of the trial, that this would be one of the points considered in the judgment and that they were expected to satisfy the court in regard to it. They have no reason to complain now if they have neglected to direct their attention to that question.\nWhat is true of the Exchequer Court and of the manner in which it may deal with a case like this applies, we apprehend, in no lesser degree to this Court. We do not doubt our power to dispose of the case upon grounds other than those stated by the Minister, grounds based on the record and which are presently to be stated.\nWe would hesitate, however, to follow the learned trial judge in his conclusion that the evidence was sufficient to hold that the word \u201cZipper\u201d had in such degree become descriptive as to preclude its registration as a trade-mark.\nThe proposition that words merely descriptive are not registrable is not disputed. It should, of course, be qualified by adding that even a descriptive word may be registered if, through long, continued and extensive use, it has acquired a secondary meaning and become adapted to distinguish the goods of the applicant (Rule X of the Patent and Copyright Office). Incidentally, it may be said that the Goodrich company quite failed in its attempt to establish that the word \u201cZipper\u201d was generally associated by the public with wares of Goodrich manufacture or selection.\nBut, in order to deny registration of a word on the ground that it is descriptive, it must be shown that, at the date of the application (which is the date to be taken into consideration), the word was a descriptive name in current use, descriptive of the article itself as distinguished from a name exclusively distinctive of the merchandise of a particular dealer or manufacturer.\nNow, in 1923, the word was a newly coined fancy word, applied to footwear equipped with slide fasteners, and not known in the language. It was none the less a fancy word because it might be said that \u201czip\u201d (an ordinary English word expressing the light sharp sound of a bullet or other object passing rapidly through the air) lies at the root of \u201cZipper\u201d (see the Bovril case[5], and the Tabloid case[6]). The application of the petitioner dates back to the first of September, 1927. The evidence bearing on the state of facts existing at that time falls far short of establishing that, in the minds of the general public, the word had then acquired a meaning descriptive of slide fasteners of the type in question. There is some evidence of the occasional use of the word in that sense in a loose way; but even that is vague in point of time and quite fails, in our opinion, to show a general acceptance and a common use of the word for the purpose of describing the article itself.\nIn our view, the record does not contain the kind of evidence required to decide that, at the time of the applications, the word \u201cZipper\u201d was not registrable, on account of having become descriptive. Accordingly we shall proceed further to examine the respective claims of the appellants, taking first that of the Objecting Party.\nWe think its application should be refused for two reasons.\nA specific trade-mark can only be registered \u201cin connection with the sale of a class merchandise of a particular description\u201d (Sec 4c).\nThe mark covers the merchandise as manufactured or sold. It may be applied to the product or the article itself, or it may be applied to the package, parcel, case, box or other vessel or receptacle containing the same (sec. 5), but it applies to the article in the form only in which it is produced or sold and not to the component parts of the article. The Goodrich company never manufactured or produced or offered for sale slide fasteners per se. They are dealers in footwear, and certain overshoes which they offer for sale are equipped with slide fasteners. That does not alter the fact that the \u201cmerchandise of a particular description\u201d which they sell is an overshoe and not a fastener. The fastener is no more the merchandise than the fabric or the rubber which, together with it, go to make up the overshoe.\nNor does the Goodrich company indicate any present intention of manufacturing or selling slide fasteners separately. In fact, the only ground upon which it advances its claim in respect of the mark as applied to fasteners is that, although it admits having \u201cpurchased all the slide fasteners required by it from the Lightning company,\u201d it inspected and selected the same before using them. Assuming this to be sufficient to justify registration under the Act, suffice it to say that there is a complete absence of satisfactory evidence to bring the Goodrich company within that condition. The learned trial judge came to the conclusion that \u201cit was not so much that (Goodrich) wished the registration, but rather that it did not wish others to get it.\u201d We think the conclusion is certainly borne out by the record.\nThis is a situation to which the principle laid down in Batt & Co.\u2019s Trade Marks[7] is clearly applicable. Bearing in mind the difference of language between the English and the Canadian Act, we would put in this way the question and answer propounded by Lindley, M.R., in the Batt case[8]: Can a man properly register a trade-mark for goods which he does not sell or intend to sell\u2014meaning by intending to sell, having at the time of registration some definite and present intention to sell certain goods or descriptions of goods, and not a mere general intention of extending his business at some future time to anything which he may think desirable? This question we answer in the negative.\nIn this connection, we may refer to what was said by Duff J., in Bayer Co. v. American Druggists\u2019 Syndicate (The Aspirin case[9]), and in Pugsley, Dingman & Co. v. Proctor & Gamble Co.[10], where he delivered the judgment of this court.\nThere might be yet another obstacle standing in the way of the Goodrich company\u2019s obtaining registration of the word \u201cZipper\u201d as a specific trade-mark for slide fasteners. They have used and registered the word in connection with footwear; but we have seen that they never used it in connection with fasteners. The exclusive right to a mark is restricted to the class of goods to which it has been attached. (Somerville v. Schembri[11]). It follows that the same mark may be used by another in connection with a different article (See dictum of Lord Westbury in the Leather Cloth case[12]).\nThe application of the Goodrich company for the registration of the word in connection with fasteners was posterior to that of the Lightning company. So that, under ordinary circumstances, as between itself and the Lightning company, with regard to \u201cZipper\u201d as applied to fasteners, the Goodrich company can claim neither prior use, nor prior adoption, nor prior application for registration, and the petition of the Lightning company should receive first consideration.\nBut, in the particular circumstances of this case, there are reasons why, in our view, the latter petition should equally be disallowed.\nGoodrich, at the inception of its business in Canada (1923-24), adopted, put into use and caused to be registered the word \u201cZipper\u201d as a specific trade-mark in connection with footwear. Since then it has offered for sale and sold under the name of \u201cZipper\u201d overshoes equipped with fasteners of the slide controlled type. These overshoes have been widely advertised and distributed. We are told that they have met with considerable success in the market. The Lightning company was manufacturing slide fasteners of the type in question, which they called \u201cLightning\u201d or \u201cHookless.\u201d The evidence is that they supplied all the slide fasteners used by Goodrich and incorporated by the latter in the overshoes sold, as above mentioned, under the name of \u201cZipper.\u201d The Lightning company fully knew that their slide fasteners were being used in that way as an integral part of a Goodrich overshoe known to the trade and offered to the public under that mark. They allowed this to go on for considerable time, after which they suddenly turned around and applied for the registration of the word \u201cZipper\u201d in connection with their slide fasteners alone. It is difficult to escape the suspicion that the application is hardly founded in truth, and that the real purpose is, in the words of Lord Watson, in Eno v. Dunn[13], \u201cto obtain pecuniary advantage from the wide reputation\u201d of the Goodrich overshoe.\nThe Lightning company admits that, if its application were acted upon as made, and authority was thus obtained for the general distribution of fasteners bearing the word \u201cZipper,\u201d the public would be deceived by the use of such fasteners on overshoes. While we are not prepared to say whether a limitation excluding such a use could be satisfactorily framed, the conclusion seems to us unavoidable, upon the state of facts already in existence at the time of the first application to the Patent Office, that to have allowed then the registration of the mark for slide fasteners alone would have meant running a grave risk of deceiving the public.\nAt that time, the following marks, among others, were already on the Register: \u201cZipper\u201d for footwear; \u201cZip-on\u201d for children\u2019s leggings, coats and hats; \u201cZip\u201d for bound loose-leaf books; \u201cZipps\u201d for boots and shoes made of rubber; \u201cZip-over,\u201d \u201cZip-kinck\u201d and \u201cZip-midy\u201d for wearing apparel for men, women and children; \u201cZip-pat\u201d for spats. All of these marks are applied to goods having or which may have slide fasteners as an integral part thereof. It is admitted these fasteners may be attached to an infinite variety of goods. Just previous to the Lightning company, the Ripper company, of Vancouver, put in an application for the word \u201cZipper\u201d as applied to receptacle opening devices. We also know that the Closgard Wardrobe Company, of Washington, wished to register the word in connection with wardrobe bags.\nMany of the articles just referred to are usually sold by the same class of persons. It is not necessary that the danger of confusion should be demonstrated, it is sufficient to say that the mark might have the effect of deceiving the public. It would be the duty of the Minister to refuse to register when it is not clear that deception may not result from such registration (Eno v. Dunn[14]). The duty of the court is the same and, to use the language of Lord Macnaghten (p. 263), it \u201cought to reject words which involve a misleading allusion.\u201d\nThe whole question must be envisaged from a business and commercial point of view, and all the circumstances of the trade are to be considered. In the premises, we are convinced that, on account of the goods with which the slide fasteners of the type in question are used or are capable of being used and owing to the state of things at the time of the applications, there would have been every likelihood of confusion if the mark had been allowed. To say the least, the extension of the number of such marks should not be encouraged (Kerly on Trade Marks, 6th ed., p. 281).\nThe adoption by the Lightning company of the word \u201cZipper,\u201d as a mark for slide fasteners, came too late in the history of the word.\nReturning again to the Goodrich company. In addition to its demand with regard to slide fasteners as such, its application also requested the Commissioner to register the mark in its name in connection with all \u201carticles containing the same.\u201d We have serious doubt whether, under the Act, a request in that form for a specific trade-mark may be entertained at all. The evidence shows that slide fasteners are used or may be used on an almost innumerable number of goods of all classes. By definition, a specific trade-mark means a mark having reference to \u201ca class merchandise of a particular description\u201d (sec. 4c). A mark intended to cover all articles containing slide fasteners would hardly answer the definition.\nBe that as it may, on that part of the petition of the Goodrich company, the trial judge found as follows: \u201cIf the application in its entirety were granted, that there would be confusion is quite certain from the evidence.\u201d\nIt is unnecessary for us to add anything to what we have already said to indicate that, on that point, we find ourselves fully in accord with the learned President of the Exchequer Court.\nThe appeal of the Lightning company and the cross-appeal of the Goodrich company should be dismissed with costs. It should be stated, however, that nothing in the present judgment may be taken as affecting the specific trade-mark of the Goodrich company in connection with footwear.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for Lightning Fastener Co.

Powell (Defendants) Respondents.\n1931: October 8, 9; 1931: December 22.\nPresent: Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nContract\u2014Company\u2014Agreement to buy shares in company\u2014Question whether agreement was for treasury shares or could be satisfied by transfer of shares held by individual shareholder\u2014Claims against stock broker for damages for alleged failure to perform agreement as to short sales and for alleged delay in carrying out instructions to transfer accounts.\nAn agreement for the sale of treasury shares of a company is not satisfied by the transfer to the purchaser of an individual shareholder's personal stock (International Casualty Co. v. Thompson, 48 Can. S.C.R. 167).\nIt was held that, on the evidence, the agreement by plaintiff, in question, to purchase shares was an agreement to purchase treasury shares of the defendant company and not shares in that company held by the individual defendant, and that plaintiff was entitled to return of the sum taken from his funds in the company's hands to pay for transfer of personal stock from the individual defendant (Smith v. Hughes, L.R. 6 Q.B. 597, held not applicable).\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, 44 B.C. Rep. 124, was reversed on the above point, but was affirmed in its disallowance of two other claims against defendant company (viz., for loss sustained because of alleged failure to perform an agreement with regard to short sales of certain mining shares, and for damages for alleged delay in carrying out instructions to transfer plaintiffs' accounts to another stock broker).\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.[1] The action was brought upon three claims: (1) The plaintiff R. K. Clay claimed damages from the defendant company for loss sustained by reason of an alleged failure to perform an agreement with regard to short sales of certain mining shares. (2) The plaintiffs jointly claimed from the defendant company damages for alleged delay in carrying out instructions to transfer their accounts to another stock broker. (3) The plaintiff R. K. Clay claimed from the defendant company and the defendant Powell the return of the sum of $2,000 and interest in connection with the sale to plaintiff of twenty shares of the defendant company's stock.\nThe trial judge, D. A. McDonald J., allowed claims no. 1 and no. 2, and disallowed claim no. 3.\nThe Court of Appeal[2] disallowed all the said claims.\nAt the hearing of the present appeal, as mentioned in the judgment now reported, this Court held against claim no. 1. By its judgment now reported it held against claim no. 2 for the reasons stated by M. A. Macdonald, J.A., in the Court of Appeal[3] ; but held in favour of the plaintiff (appellant) as to claim no. 3, thus reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal and of the trial judge on this claim, which is the only one dealt with at length in the present judgment. The material facts in connection with it are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported.\nJ. A. MacInnes for the appellants.\nJ. A. Ritchie, K.C., and E. F. Newcombe, K.C., for the respondents.\nANGLIN, C.J.C.\u2014I would allow this appeal with regard to the $2,000 taken by defendants for shares supplied by Powell ; otherwise, I would dismiss the appeal. In view of the disposition I make of it, I would allow no costs.\nThe judgment of Rinfret, Lamont, Smith and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nRINFRET J.\u2014The appellant R. K. Clay is an author residing in Vancouver, B.C., and the appellant A. K. Clay is his wife. The respondent company carries on a general business of stock brokers in Vancouver. The respondent Sydney P. Powell is a stock broker and also a shareholder and director in the respondent S. P. Powell & Company, Limited.\nThe appellants' action against the respondents was based on three separate transactions. It comprised:\n1. A claim for loss sustained by reason of an alleged failure to perform an agreement with regard to short sales of certain mining shares.\n2. A claim for damages arising out of the respondents' delay in carrying out instructions to transfer the appellants' accounts to another stock broker.\n3. A claim for the return of $2,000 in connection with the sale of twenty shares of the respondent company's stock to the appellant R. K. Clay.\nThe trial judge allowed claim no. 1, but the Court of Appeal reversed his judgment and dismissed the action in regard to it. In this Court, after hearing argument by counsel for the appellants and without calling on counsel for the respondents, we were all satisfied that the claim failed. Announcement to that effect was made from the Bench by our Lord the Chief Justice.\nClaim no. 2 was allowed by the trial judge and disallowed by the Court of Appeal. For the reasons stated by Mr. Justice M. A. Macdonald, with whom the majority of the other Judges of Appeal concurred, we think this claim also fails.\nIt remains to consider claim no. 3. This claim was disallowed by the trial judge, and his judgment was affirmed on appeal.\nIt is set out as follows in the statement of claim:\nIn or about the month of August, 1929, the Plaintiff, R. K. Clay, was solicited by the Defendant, S. P. Powell, to purchase 20 shares of the Treasury stock of the Defendant Company, at the par value of $100 each, and the said Plaintiff, believing that he was purchasing Treasury shares of the said Company, at a later date agreed to purchase 20 Treasury shares of the Defendant Company, at the par value of $100 each, namely, $2,000.\nThe Defendant Company never allotted or issued or caused to be allotted or issued to the said Plaintiff any of its Treasury shares, but at a date unknown to the Plaintiff and known to both Defendants, the Defendant, Sydney P. Powell, purported to transfer to the Plaintiff 20 shares in the Defendant Company which had already been allotted to and was then owned by the Defendant, S. P. Powell, and the Defendant Company thereupon debited the Plaintiff's account with the said sum of $2,000, and at a date unknown to the Plaintiff but known to both the Defendants, purported to transfer the said sum to the Defendant, S. P. Powell, and the said S. P. Powell thereupon converted the said moneys to his own use.\nOn the 14th day of May, 1930, the said Plaintiff ascertained that the 20 shares of stock so purported to have been issued to him were not Treasury stock of the Defendant Company but were 20 shares of the issued capital of the said Company owned by S. P. Powell, and the Plaintiff thereupon repudiated the said transaction and demanded from the Defendants a return of the said sum of $2,000, but the Defendants and each of them has neglected and refused to refund the said moneys to the Plaintiff.\nThe defence was that:\nR. K. Clay himself requested the said Defendants to sell him 20 shares of S. P. Powell & Co. Limited stock which the said Defendant agreed to do and that there was no offer or subscription at any time made by the said Plaintiff for unissued shares of S. P. Powell & Co., Limited, and the said Plaintiff well knew that he was purchasing shares the property of the Defendant Powell. The transfer of the said shares from the Defendant Powell to the said Plaintiff was made by one Ley, then an officer of the Defendant Company and the agent of the said Plaintiff, to buy and sell shares at his discretion.\nThe parties went to trial and we have to examine how far their respective contentions were borne out by the evidence adduced. It is preferable that we should do so by quoting from the testimony itself.\nThe following is taken from the evidence of Robert K. Clay :\nQ. Were you ever approached at any time to buy any stocks in S. P. Powell & Company Limited?\u2014A. I was.\nQ. When and where was that?\u2014A. About August, 1929, in a restaurant called the Bon Ton at lunch.\nQ. You were approached by whom?\u2014A. Mr. Powell.\nQ. Any other person?\u2014A. No, Mr. Ley was present.\nQ. Mr. Ley was present, and what was your conversation with Mr. Powell regarding the stocks in S. P. Powell & Company Limited?\u2014A. To the effect that I had surplus funds in my account and that it would be a good investment for me to put a certain amount of money in the company.\nQ. Yes, was the price of the stock discussed?\u2014A. No, I understand it was par\u2014the par value was $100.\nQ. And what was your answer to Mr. Powell?\u2014A. That I would think it over.\nQ. When did you next have any conversation with him?\u2014A. The next transaction was after Mr. Powell had gone away.\nQ. Yes?\u2014A. And I spoke to Mr. Ley\u2014\nQ. No, just before you start on Mr. Ley, what was Mr. Ley's position with S. P. Powell & Company Limited?\u2014A. Well, he was a partner, so far as I know.\nThe COURT: He was not a partner in the limited company?\u2014A. Well, he was associated with him as a partner. Mr. ARNOLD: Is my friend prepared to admit that he was at that time a director?\nMr. BULL: Yes.\nThe COURT: What?\nMr. ARNOLD: My friend admits that he was a director in the company.\nQ. Well, what was your conversation with Mr. Ley regarding this stock?\u2014A. I told him I was ready to take out stock in the company\u2014\nMr. BULL: Of course any conversations with Ley\u2014well, admissions by Ley at that time might be evidence against the company, would not be evidence against Powell as an individual defendant.\nThe COURT: I will keep that in mind.\nMr. ARNOLD: Q. Yes?\u2014A. And he said that it would be necessary for him to see Mr. Tupper.\nQ. Yes?\u2014A. And as a result of his interview with Mr. Tupper, he wrote me a letter.\nQ. Now, what were the contents of that letter?\u2014A. They were to the effect that Mr. Ley had seen Mr. Tupper and that it was impossible for the stock to be issued until the return of Mr. Powell.\nQ. I see. Did you see Mr. Powell at all after that?\u2014A. When he returned.\nQ. Do you remember when that was?\u2014A. Well, he returned about January\u2014sometime about January.\nQ. Of 1930?\u2014A. 1930.\nQ. Did you have any conversation with Mr. Powell regarding the stock?\u2014A. No.\nQ. What was the next that you heard about this stock?\u2014A. Well, the next that I heard about it was the transfer of Lot 8\u2014on February 8th, of $2,000. I received a debit note for $2,000.\nQ. Now, at any of the conversations between you and Mr. Powell, had you ever heard\u2014had you ever been told or did you hear anything said by Mr. Powell that you were buying S. P. Powell's personal stock?\u2014A. No.\nStatements to the same effect were made by Clay throughout his testimony.\nThis evidence of Clay should be read in the light of what Ley testifies to. We have seen that, at the time, Ley was a director of the S. P. Powell & Company, Limited; or, to put it more exactly, a partner in that company\u2014a private company really controlled by Powell. Before approaching Clay with the object of inducing him to buy the shares in question, Powell had discussed matters with Ley, and Ley gives the following account of their conversation:\nMr. ARNOLD: Q.What was your conversation with Mr. Powell?\u2014A. The conversation was that we hadn't at that time sufficient money as working capital. We required more money for working capital. It was suggested by Mr. Powell to me that we should approach one or two of the more well-to-do of our clients with a view to asking them to take stock in the company. Q. Now, what stock were they going to take in the company?\u2014A. Well, obviously treasury stock.\nQ. Treasury stock; and as a result of that conversation with Mr. Powell did you have a conversation with Mr. Clay?\u2014A. We did, jointly.\nQ. Whereabouts was that?\u2014A. At the Bon Ton at a lunch.\nQ. And what was the conversation?\u2014A. It was suggested to Mr. Clay that the purchase of stock in the Company\u2014S. P. Powell & Company Limited would be a good investment for him.\nMr. BULL: Q. What is that again?\u2014A. For some of his surplus funds.\nQ. I didn't hear the answer?\u2014A. It was suggested to Mr. Clay that an investment in the stock of S. P. Powell & Company Limited would prove a good investment for some of his surplus funds.\nMr. ARNOLD: Q. Yes, when Mr. Clay was approached what did he say?\u2014A. He said he would consider it.\nQ. When next did you have any conversation about it?\u2014A. I think not until about three months later.\nQ. Where was Mr. Powell then?\u2014A. Mr. Powell was on his way around the world on a pleasure trip.\nQ. And you had a conversation with Mr. Clay, did you?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. What was the conversation you had with Mr. Clay?\u2014A. It was one of the routine conversations, I think, which took place in regard to his operations in general, and at the same time I informed him that the company was doing quite reasonably well, and asked him if he was still considering the question of taking stock in the company. I said I considered it would be a good investment for somebody and he said that he thought he would take it.\nQ. That he would\u2014A. In fact he definitely decided to take it then.\nWe have thus the whole story of the transaction from the lips of Clay himself, and his story is corroborated by Ley.\nPowell contradicts Clay, but, as to that, the trial judge said :\nSpeaking generally, I think Clay told the truth. I may be mistaken, but I have to size up the witnesses as best I can as I see them. Where Clay's evidence is in conflict with any other witness, I accept his. I think he spoke candidly, and he did not try to colour his evidence where he might have done so very much to his own assistance.\nNow, accepting Clay's evidence as the learned trial judge did, we think the logical consequence is that he is entitled to succeed in respect of this part of his action.\nPowell's proposition to Clay was that he should \"put a certain amount of money in the company.\" The ordinary meaning that those words would convey to Clay was that he should buy the company's treasury stock. In no other way could he put money in the company, and certainly not by purchasing Powell's personal stock. That that was Clay's understanding of the transaction was held by the trial judge. That that was also what Powell had in mind when he made the proposition is, in our view, established beyond doubt by the fact that Powell's object, as disclosed by Ley, was to secure more money for the company as \"working capital\"\u2014an object quite impossible of being secured by simply selling his own stock. That view is strengthened by the fact that Powell never at any time mentioned his personal stock, which, on account of the usual interpretation of the words he used, would have been well nigh, if not entirely, necessary in order to give them the meaning he now contends for. If he wished Clay to understand he was offering his own stock, the only way was to tell him.\nThe view is further supported by the terms of the letter above referred to and written by Ley after his interview with Tupper. Clay was told in that letter \"that it was impossible for the stock to be issued until the return of Mr. Powell\"\u2014an expression applicable only to treasury stock.\nWe must decide, therefore, that what Powell proposed to Clay was the purchase of the company's treasury stock. And as, according to the evidence, no other proposition was ever made to Clay, it follows that what Clay accepted later was the proposition to buy treasury stock and not Powell's personal stock.\nAs a result, the matter stood in this way:\nClay had surplus funds in the hands of S. P. Powell & Company, Limited. For those funds the company has to account to Clay. They can only do so by showing that they used the funds in accordance with his instructions. They were authorized to debit his account of $2,000 for the purchase of the company's treasury stock. They never got authority to use the money otherwise. They are not properly accounting for it by showing that with that money they purchased Powell's personal stock.\nIt may be added that no stock of any kind, either treasury stock or Powell's own stock, was ever allotted, issued or transferred to Clay. The latter never received any certificate of any kind. When the accounts were given over by the respondents to Ley & Co. on the 15th of May, 1930, statements were delivered shewing the state of Clay's accounts. These statements purported to indicate the final settlement. Yet, neither of them shewed that any of the respondent company's stock was held for the credit of R. K. Clay. The learned trial judge based his judgment on the authority of Smith v. Hughes[4], and we are referred by counsel for the respondents to a passage of the judgment of Blackburn J. in that case, where he said[5] :\nI agree that on the sale of a specific article, unless there be a warranty making it part of the bargain that it possesses some particular quality, the purchaser must take the article he has bought though it does not possess that quality.\nWe do not think the case applies. In the present instance, it is not a question of quality, it is a question of identity. In Smith v. Hughes[6], the plaintiff offered to sell oats to the defendant and exhibited a sample. The defendant took the sample and, on the following day, wrote to say that he would take the oats. The defendant afterwards refused the oats on the ground that they were new, and he thought he was buying old oats. Nothing, however, was said at the time the sample was shewn as to the oats being old, but the price was very high for new oats. And the case went on the principle that there is no legal obligation in a vendor to inform a purchaser that the latter is under a mistake not induced by the act of the vendor.\nBe that as it may, with due deference, we find no similarity between the two cases. It is sufficient to say that in Smith v. Hughes[7] , the purchaser had got the specific article he bought, in the present case the purchaser did not. An offer duly accepted to sell treasury shares of a company is not satisfied by the transfer to the purchaser of an individual shareholder's personal stock (International Casualty Co. v. Thompson[8] ).\nThe appellant R. K. Clay is entitled to the return of the sum taken out of his funds in the hands of the respondent company to pay for S. P. Powell's personal stock in the company. But he has already received $50, supposed to represent dividend earned by the stock. The company had no authority to issue the dividend cheque to Clay, for he never was registered as a shareholder. He accepted it then, because he understood the transaction to have been carried out as agreed and that treasury stock had been issued to him. As soon as he ascertained what really took place, he tendered back the $50 at once, through Messrs. MacInnes & Arnold, his solicitors, who signed and sent a cheque for that sum to the order of S. P. Powell & Co., Limited. The cheque was not cashed. It was produced in court by the company and marked as exhibit in the record. In view of the result, the company should get that money back. The most convenient way is to deduct it from the sum of $2,000, leaving a balance of $1,950 owing to R. K. Clay, together with interest thereon from the date when the money was debited to him in the books of the company. As a consequence, the cheque of MacInnes & Arnold should be cancelled and ordered returned to them.\nThe appeal should be allowed accordingly and judgment entered as stated in favour of the appellant R. K. Clay against both respondents. The respondent Powell got the money and must be condemned to repay it jointly with the company. The judgment entails cancellation of whatever transfer may have been made by Powell to R. K. Clay of any shares in the respondent S. P. Powell & Company, Limited, and also the rectification, if any be required, of the share register.\nOn the whole, the appeal is dismissed in respect of any claim with which the appellant A. K. Clay is concerned, and the appellant R. K. Clay succeeds only upon one of the three claims involved in the appeal and in which he was interested. In view of the disposition so made, we would allow no costs of the appeal to this court. Following the method of division adopted by the trial judge with regard to the costs of the action, the appellant R. K. Clay should have judgment for one-third of those costs in the court of first instance.\nAs for the costs in the Court of Appeal: The effect of our judgment is to confirm the decision of the Court of Appeal on the main appeal brought to that court. The adjudication as to costs on the main appeal before that court should not therefore be disturbed. But the appellant R. K. Clay now succeeds on what was the subject of his cross-appeal to the Court of Appeal, and the present respondents must pay the costs of that cross-appeal.\nAppeal allowed in part.\nSolicitors for the appellants: MacInnes & Arnold.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Stuart H.

Before the trial this company made an assignment and the respondent became trustee in bankruptcy. The appellant Johnston was the Deputy Minister of Marine and Fisheries, the appellant Found, Director of Fisheries Service, the appellant Motherwell, the Inspector of Fisheries for British Columbia, and the appellant Mackie, a fisheries officer for the district of Prince Rupert. In 1924, the cannery company constructed the bulk of an old steamship into a salmon cannery. In the summer of 1926, when the boat was fastened to the wharf of a cannery on land and operated for canning salmon, it was seized by the appellants, the fish that were canned were seized, and the company was prevented from operating. The acts of the appellants complained of were performed by them in the execution of their respective offices, and as a result of the company having operated in breach of certain sections of the Fisheries Act, which sections were later declared to be ultra vires the Dominion Parliament. The appellants moved under marginal rules 282 and 283 of British Columbia for a decision on a point of law raised in the pleadings, namely, that they were protected from an action such as this by reason of the provisions of section 9 of the Magistrates Act.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the appellants.\nW. E. Williams K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nDUFF J.\u2014The section to be construed is in these words,\nSec. 9. No action shall be brought against any Judge, Stipendiary or Police Magistrate, Justice of the Peace, or officer, for any act or thing by him done under the supposed authority of a Statute or statutory provision of the Province or of the Dominion, which Statute or statutory provision was beyond the legislative jurisdiction of the Province or of the Parliament of Canada, as the case may be, provided such action would not lie against him if the said Statute or statutory provision had been within the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament or Legislature which assumed to enact the same.\nWe can find no ground in what is known as the ejusdem generis doctrine, for limiting the term \"officer\" in such a way as to exclude all officers who are not judicial officers from its denotation. The rule is a working rule of construction which, properly applied, is of assistance in elucidating the intention of the legislature; although there is too much reason to think that sometimes the result of applying it has been to override that intention. In the present case, we think the governing words are \"for any act or thing by him done under the supposed authority of the statute or statutory provision of the province or of the Dominion.\" It may be that the context would justify the limitation of the scope of the term \"officer,\" so as to restrict its application to public officers; but, beyond that, we can think of no limitation to which it is properly subject, other than that expressed by the words we have just quoted. The argument that only judicial officers are contemplated logically involves the contention that an act or thing done by any person, in order to fall within the ambit of the section, must be an act or thing in its nature judicial.\nNow we find it quite impossible to say that a county judge or a justice of the peace, performing executive duties under a statute, and many such duties are imposed upon such functionaries, is not within the protection of section 9. We can find no reason, no shadow indeed of justification, for so limiting the plain words of the enactment. That being the case, we can perceive no ground for holding that a public officer, not belonging to any of the specific classes of officers enumerated, is not, when performing executive duties, within the descriptive words of the section, and, subject to the conditions prescribed, entitled to claim the benefit of it.\nAs to the title of the Act, it is to be observed that the title, taken from R.S.B.C., 1924, is \"An Act respecting the justices of the peace and other magistrates.\" These words do not, when read according to common usage, include judges; and they do not, obviously, indicate adequately the character of the provisions of the statute. The title does not, in our view, materially assist in the construction of section 9.\nWe do not think it is convenient to deal with the contention that the action should be dismissed on the ground that the determination of this question of law virtually disposes of the controversy between the parties. The action is not exclusively based upon the allegation that the relevant provisions of the Fisheries Act were ultra vires. It is, in part, based upon the proposition that, if intra vires, the Fisheries Act would afford no protection. No application was made in the court below to strike out the pleading as disclosing no reasonable cause of action, or to dismiss the action as vexatious, and in the factum the only point substantially argued is that just dealt with; and, although the statement of claim seems, in more than one respect, to be objectionable, we think we ought to limit the judgment on this appeal to setting aside the judgments below and declaring that the appellants are \"officers\" within the meaning of the Magistrates Act. The respondents, however, must undertake to go to trial within a reasonable time; the precise date can be fixed on the settlement of the minutes. The appellants may have liberty to apply to strike out the statement of claim as embarrassing, or as disclosing no reasonable cause of action, or for particulars, or to dismiss the action as vexatious. The respondents must pay the costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia, and to this court, the costs of the proceedings before Mr. Justice D. A. MacDonald to be costs in the cause.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Knox Walkem.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Williams, Manson, Gonzales & Taylor.\n[1] (1931) 44 B.C.R. 354; [1931] 3 W.W.R. 33; [1931] 4 D.L.R. 569.\n[2] (1931 44 B.C.R. 44; [1931] 3 D.L.R. 318.\n"}

Berry (Defendant).\n1931: February 3; 1931: October 6.\nPresent: Duff, Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nInsurance, accident\u2014Automobile driven by insured's daughter\u2014Judgment obtained against her for negligent driving\u2014Action defended by insurance company\u2014Action against insurance company to recover amount of judgment\u2014Liability\u2014Estoppel\u2014Insurance Act, B.C., 1925, c. 20, s. 24.\nB, the owner of an automobile, was insured against loss in the appellant company. The respondent was injured while riding in a car driven by her husband which collided with B's car driven by his daughter with B's permission and recovered judgment against her for damages, the appellant company taking charge of the defence on the trial. The re- spondent then brought an action against the appellant insurance company under section 24 of the Insurance Act (B.C.) 1925, c. 20, to recover the amount of the judgment rendered against B's daughter. That section provides: \"24. Where a person incurs liability for injury or damage to the person or property of another and is insured against such liability and fails to satisfy a judgment awarding damages against him in respect of such liability, and an execution against him in respect thereof is returned unsatisfied, the person entitled to the damages may recover by action against the insurer the amount of the judgment up to the face value of the policy, but subject to the same equities as the insurer would have if the judgment had been satisfied.\" Under the policy, the indemnity to the owner was also \"available in the same manner and under the same conditions as it is available to the insured to any person or persons while riding in or legally operating the automobile *** with the permission of the insured ***.\"\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal (43 B.C. Rep. 161), that the respondent was not entitled to recover judgment against the appellant company for the amount recovered in the judgment against B's daughter as the latter was not \"insured\" within the meaning of s. 24 of the Insurance Act. Section 24 of the Insurance Act is a provision in aid of execution and in the nature of a garnishee proceeding. The action thereby authorized lies only if the judgment debtor, in this case B's daughter, is insured or has a right to recover indemnity from the insurer. The policy being between B. and the appellant company, B's daughter is not a party to it and there is no consideration moving from her to the insurer for the covenant upon which the respondent relies to establish that B's daughter was insured within the meaning of section 24. While it may be that B, according to the covenant, may recover from the insurer, presumably for the benefit of a person driving his car with his permission, it cannot be said that the insured can be compelled to exercise such a right of recovery or to undertake the duties and responsibilities of a trustee, unless by his consent or by reason of his having become a custodian of indemnity belonging to his daughter. Section 24 does not confer upon the licensee of the car a right of action upon the policy to recover against the insurer or to compel the insured to exercise his remedies for the recovery and the insured cannot be compelled to become a trustee for a stranger for no other cause than that he had permitted the stranger to drive his car or to ride in it at a time when that stranger negligently caused an accident in which a third party suffered bodily injuries.\nHeld, also, that the appellant company, by its conduct in defending the respondent's action against B's daughter, was not estopped from denying liability under the insurance policy on the ground that she was not \"insured\" within the meaning of section 24[1]. APPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2], affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Gregory J.[3] which had maintained the respondent's action for $5,000 and allowing, on a cross appeal, a further sum of $648.70.\nThe material facts of the case and the question at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nW. N. Tilley K.C., and N. B. Gash K.C., for the appellant.\nC. L. McAlpine for the respondent.\nDUFF, J.\u2014I agree with the conclusion of my brother Newcombe and in substance with his reasons.\nThe action out of which the appeal arises was instituted under s. 24 of the B.C. Insurance Act of 1925, c. 20, which reads as follows:\n24. Where a person incurs liability for injury or damage to the person or property of another and is insured against such liability and fails to satisfy a judgment awarding damages against him in respect of such liability, and an execution against him in respect thereof is returned unsatisfied, the person entitled to the damages may recover by action against the insurer the amount of the judgment up to the face value of the policy, but subject to the same equities as the insurer would have if the judgment had been satisfied.\nThe respondent was injured in a motor accident, the car in which she was a passenger having come into collision with a car owned by the defendant, R. E. Berry, and driven by his daughter, Jean Berry. The judgment was against Jean Berry for $4,600 damages and costs taxed at $780.25. In the action Jean Berry was the sole defendant, and she was defended by solicitors appointed by the appellants, professing to act in pursuance of the policy, her father, R. E. Berry, having given notice of the accident pursuant to the policy.\nThe B.C. courts held that by virtue of this policy, Miss Jean Berry was \"insured\" within the meaning of s. 24 in respect of any liability attaching to her by reason of automobile accidents while driving a car belonging to her father, and consequently that the respondent was entitled to recover from the appellants the amount of her judgment up to the sum named in the policy. I agree that the insurance contemplated by s. 24 is one which confers a right of indemnity, that is within the protection of the law, that is to say, one which the person incurring the liability has the legal means, direct or indirect, of enforcing. I think this is so for two reasons. First, unless it is so restricted in its operation, it is difficult to assign any certain limits to the scope of the section. Second, the section does provide for a method by which the liability of the insurance company to the person responsible for the injuries may be made available for the benefit of the person injured. In many cases, no doubt, the same result might be achieved through a receiver by way of equitable execution\u2014perhaps in all cases; but the legislature has seen fit to give to the person injured a direct action against the insurance company in his own name, and there may have been very good reasons for doing so. So long as the enactment is limited to enforcing against the insurance company a right which could have been enforced through the courts by the person responsible for the injury, the insurance company, so far as one can see, can have nothing to complain of, especially in cases in which the same object could have been effectuated by a more circuitous method. It would, however, be an obvious injustice to establish by legislation a right of recourse against the insurance company in respect of which no person having a right of indemnity enforceable against the insurance company, is in any way responsible. Here the father, R. E. Berry, was responsible for his daughter's act under s. 12 of c. 44 of the British Columbia statutes of 1926 and 1927, but the respondent elected to proceed against the daughter. No judgment having been recovered against the father, the conditions never arose, under which, alone, by the terms of the policy, the insurance company could be called upon to indemnify him in respect of his liability to the respondent. It would, I repeat, be a monstrous injustice to impose upon the insurance company, by statute, a liability to the daughter or to persons injured by the act of the daughter, which the daughter could not enforce directly, or indirectly, in the absence of some such enactment, and a construction leading to that result ought not to be accepted unless the language employed is so clear as to leave no reasonable way of escape. The respondent bases her claim upon two alternative contentions. The first is that Miss Berry was entitled to require the insurance company to indemnify her in respect of the judgment recovered against her, either directly or indirectly, by calling upon her father to take proceedings under the policy. The second ground is that in consequence of the steps taken by the insurance company in defence of the action, they are estopped from denying Miss Berry's right to indemnity under the policy, as against both Miss Berry and the plaintiff.\nIt will be convenient to consider these contentions in the order in which I have stated them. I agree with my brother Newcombe, that there is no ground for holding that the policy was effected by R. E. Berry as trustee for Miss Berry.\nThe clause relied upon, by which the indemnity under section E becomes available for the benefit of the classes of persons mentioned in it, does not, I think, disclose an intention to declare that the named insured is contracting as trustee. That clause is in these words:\u2014\nThe foregoing indemnity provided by section D and\/or E shall be available in the same manner and under the same conditions as it is available to the insured to any person or persons riding in or legally operating the automobile for private or pleasure purposes, with the permission of the insured, or of an adult member of the insured's household other than a chauffeur or domestic servant; provided that the indemnity payable hereunder shall be applied, first, to the protection of the named insured, and the remainder, if any, to the protection of the other persons entitled to indemnity under the terms of this section as the named insured shall in writing direct.\nIt may be that a trust would arise in consequence of a written direction by the insured under this clause; but until there is such a direction, at all events, it seems clear that the named insured is entirely master of the situation, and under no enforceable obligation to require the company to indemnify any one of the classes of persons described. Indeed until a direction in writing is given, he is not entitled to require the insurance company to provide indemnity in respect of any liability other than his own.\nThen as to agency. The fair inference from the clause as a whole is that he is not contracting as agent; and since he is not professing to contract as agent, ratification (assuming there be adequate evidence of ratification) would be of no avail. A word upon Williams v. Baltic Insurance Association of London[4]. There the action was brought by the named insured; and ratification by the beneficiary before the accident occurred brought the case within the scope of Lord Campbell's judgment in Waters' case[5]. The question of the right of the beneficiary to recover on the policy in her own name is not discussed in the judgment, and, apparently, that question was not considered material by Roche J. The judgment lends no support to the respondent.\nThere remains the question whether, by defending the action, the appellants have precluded themselves from denying that Miss Berry was \"insured\" under policy within the meaning of s. 24. The appellants professed to undertake the defence of the action on her behalf under the policy, and upon the invitation of the father. That was a recognition that the claim against Miss Berry was a claim covered by the policy; but it was not necessarily a recognition of Miss Berry's right to require indemnity either directly or indirectly by compelling her father to proceed. The course of the company is quite naturally attributable to a desire to fulfil their obligations to R. E. Berry himself; and there is no evidence to justify the conclusion that the solicitors who acted for Miss Berry had not her full consent to do so. It is impossible to affirm, judicially, upon the evidence before us, that the solicitors derived their authority solely from the policy. Whether, in assuming the defence of the action in execution of a contract with the father, and with the daughter's consent, the company may have exposed themselves to a charge of maintenance, is another question. The appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE, J.\u2014The respondent was injured while riding in a car, driven by her husband, which collided with a car belonging to the defendant, R. E. Berry, and driven by his daughter, Jean Berry. The respondent, in an action against Jean Berry, recovered judgment on 13th June, 1928, for $4,600 damages and costs, taxed at $780.25; and, in third party proceedings, the respondent's husband was held liable to contribute to Jean Berry $2,300 and costs, upon the finding that he and she, the drivers of the two cars, were guilty of negligence in the same degree.\nThe defendant, R. E. Berry, was insured, by a combination automobile policy of the appellant company, against legal liability for bodily injuries or death of one person, for $5,000; and it was provided by the clause described as \"Insuring agreements,\" printed upon the back of the policy, that the insurers agreed, among other clauses, to section E, entitled \"Legal liability for bodily injuries or death\", and thereby undertook (quoting the words and figures),\n(1) To indemnify the insured against loss from the liability imposed by law upon the insured for damages on account of bodily injuries (including death, at any time resulting therefrom) accidentally suffered or alleged to have been suffered by any person or persons (excluding employees of the insured engaged in the operation, maintenance and repair of the automobile, and employees of the insured who at the time of the accident are engaged in the trade, business, profession or occupation of the insured) as a result of the ownership, maintenance or use of the automobile; provided that on account of bodily injuries to or the death of one person the insurer's liability under this section shall not exceed the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), and subject to the same limit for each person the insurer's liability on account of bodily injuries to or the death of more than one person as the result of one accident shall not exceed the sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00).\n(2) To serve the insured in the investigation of every accident covered by this policy and in the adjustment, or negotiations therefor, of any claim resulting therefrom.\n(3) To defend in the name and on behalf of the insured any civil actions which may at any time be brought against the insured on account of such injuries, including actions alleging such injuries and demanding damages therefor, although such actions are wholly groundless, false or fraudulent, unless the insurer shall elect to settle such actions.\n(4) To pay all costs taxed against the insured in any legal proceeding defended by the insurer; and all interest accruing after entry of judgment upon such part of same as is not in excess of the insurer's limit of liability, as hereinbefore expressed.\n(5) To reimburse the insured for the expense incurred in providing such immediate surgical relief as is imperative at the time such injuries are sustained.\nThe foregoing indemnity provided by sections D and\/or E shall be available in the same manner and under the same conditions as it is available to the insured to any person or persons while riding in or legally operating the automobile for private or pleasure purposes, with the permission of the insured, or of an adult member of the insured's household other than a chauffeur or domestic servant; provided that the indemnity payable hereunder shall be applied, first, to the protection of the named insured, and the remainder, if any, to the protection of the other persons entitled to indemnity under the terms of this section as the named insured shall in writing direct.\nIt is provided by the Insurance Act of British Columbia, 1925, c. 20, s. 24, that\nWhere a person incurs liability for injury or damage to the person or property of another, and is insured against such liability, and fails to satisfy a judgment awarding damages against him in respect of such liability, and an execution against him in respect thereof is returned unsatisfied, the person entitled to the damages may recover by action against the insurer the amount of the judgment up to the face value of the policy, but subject to the same equities as the insurer would have if the judgment had been satisfied.\nThe defendant, R. E. Berry, had given notice of the accident to the insurers, pursuant to the policy, and his daughter, Jean, in the action to which I have referred, was represented and defended by solicitors named and instructed by the appellant company.\nThe present action was commenced on 20th May, 1929, against the appellant company as sole defendant; but, by order of 7th October, 1929, R. E. Berry was added as a defendant, subject to a proviso\nthat the joinder should not in itself entitle the plaintiff to any relief which she could not have claimed if the action had commenced at the time of such joinder.\nThe action was tried before Gregory, J., of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[6], who held that the plaintiff (respondent) was entitled to recover from the defendant company (appellant) the sum of $5,000 and her costs. The company appealed, and the respondent cross-appealed claiming that the amount of her recovery was insufficient and should be increased by the sum of $648.70. The Court of Appeal, composed of Martin, Galliher and McPhillips, JJ.[7], dismissed the appeal and allowed the cross-appeal, directing that the judgment should be increased by the sum claimed.\nUpon the appeal to this court the appellant company contends that Jean Berry was not entitled to sue upon the policy, and that a case of liability under the policy has not been established. There are other submissions on behalf of the appellant, to which, in my view, it will be unnecessary to refer.\nThe main question depends upon the interpretation of s. 24 of the Insurance Act in its application to the provisions of section E of the Insuring agreements, by which it is provided, as already shewn, that the indemnity shall be\navailable in the same manner and under the same conditions as it is available to the insured to any person or persons while riding in or legally operating the automobile for private or pleasure purposes, with the permission of the insured ***.\nSection 24 is obviously a provision in aid of execution and in the nature of a garnishee proceeding. The action there by authorized lies only if the judgment debtor, in this case Jean Berry, is insured, or, as I interpret it, has a right to recover indemnity from an insurer. Now the policy is between R. E. Berry, the insured, and the appellant company, the insurer, and Jean Berry, the insured's daughter, is not a party to it. Moreover, there is no consideration moving from her to the insurer for the covenant upon which the respondent relies to establish that Miss Berry is insured, within the meaning of section 24 of the statute. In Colyear v. Mulgrave[8], to which the Court of Appeal referred with approval In re.D'Angibau, Andrews v. Andrews[9], it was held that where two persons for valuable consideration as between themselves covenant to do some act for the benefit of a third person, that person cannot enforce the covenant against the two, though either of the two might do so against the other.\nIn Tweddle v. Atkinson[10], in the Queen's Bench, the judgment of Wightman, J., in which Crompton and Blackburn, JJ. agreed, is as follows:\nSome of the old decisions appear to support the proposition that a stranger to the consideration of a contract may maintain an action upon it, if he stands in such a near relationship to the party from whom the consideration proceeds, that he may be considered a party to the consideration. The strongest of those cases is that cited in Bourne v. Mason[11], in which it was held that the daughter of a physician might maintain assumpsit upon a promise to her father to give her a sum of money if he performed a certain cure. But there is no modern case in which the proposition has been supported. On the contrary, it is now established that no stranger to the consideration can take advantage of a contract, although made for his benefit.\nIn Gray v. Pearson[12], Willes, J., said, at the beginning of his judgment:\nI am of opinion that this action cannot be maintained, and for the simple reason,\u2014a reason not applicable merely to the procedure of this country, but one affecting all sound procedure,\u2014\u2014that the proper person to bring an action is the person whose right has been violated. In Gandy v. Gandy[13], Bowen, L.J., said\nIt was supposed at one time in the history of our common law, that there was an exceptional class of cases, in which where a contract was made for the benefit of a person who was not a contracting party, that is to say, a stranger, it could be enforced by that person at law. It would be mere pedantry now to go through the history of that idea: it is sufficient to say that in the case of Tweddle v. Atkinson[14], to which we were referred, the true common law doctrine has been laid down. But whatever may have been the common law doctrine, if the true intent and the true effect of this deed was to give to the children a beneficial right under it, that is to say, to give them a right to have these covenants performed, and to call upon the trustees to protect their rights and interests under it, then the children would be outside the common law doctrine, and would, in a Court of Equity, be allowed to enforce their rights under the deed. But the whole application of that doctrine of course depends upon its being made out that upon the true construction of this deed it was a deed which gave the children such a beneficial right.\nNumerous other cases might be cited to the same effect, and Lord Haldane's speech in Dunlop Pneumatic Tire Coy. v. Selfridge and Coy.[15], should not be overlooked.\nI construe the policy to have effect only as between the parties to it, namely, R. E. Berry and the company; and while it may be that the former, according to the covenant, may recover from the insurer, presumably for the benefit of a person driving his car with his permission, I find nothing to convince me that the insured can be compelled to exercise such a right of recovery or to undertake the duties and responsibilities of a trustee, unless by his consent or by reason of his having become the custodian of indemnity belonging to his daughter. The intention of the clause is, perhaps, not perfectly clear; but it should be so construed, if possible, as to make it operative for some purpose. Certainly, it does not confer upon the licensee of the car a right of action upon the policy to recover against the insurer, or to compel the insured to exercise his remedies for the recovery; and it seems unreasonable to suppose that the insured would be compelled to become a trustee for a stranger for no other cause than that he or a member of his household had permitted the stranger to drive his car or to ride in it at a time when that stranger negligently caused an accident in which a third party suffered bodily injuries.\nBut it is said that this case is different because of what I am about to state. The plaintiff, in her action against Miss Berry, in answer to the company's denial that Miss Berry was insured, pleaded that the company, by its conduct in defending the plaintiff's action against her, was estopped from denying liability under the insurance policy issued by the company to Miss Berry's father. The evidence is that Mr. Berry, as the insured, under that policy, gave, in his own name, notice of the accident to the insurer, and that, on the back of this notice, his daughter filled up and signed the form requiring a statement of particulars from her as the \"person driving car at time of accident\". Mr. Berry is asked \"Who defended the action?\" and he says \"The insurance company\". In his examination for discovery, he said that he knew the action against his daughter was defended by the insurance company, and that neither he nor his daughter paid for any legal services in connection with that lawsuit. Referring to the company, he says that \"They got all the information from my daughter; they did not ask me for anything\". The adjusters, he says, took the whole matter over. Miss Berry, upon discovery after judgment, says that she knew the company's solicitors were her solicitors. The learned judges in British Columbia seem to have thought that in view of these facts, the company became liable, as insurer, to indemnify Miss Berry; but, with due respect, I do not agree. What the evidence suggests, and what I think may be assumed, is that the company was acting in pursuance of its practice under section E of the Insuring agreements, and not with the intention or effect of incurring, or as representing itself as willing to incur, any obligation for payment of indemnity to the insured's daughter not enforceable by her under the policy. The essentials of estoppel are lacking; and the company's defence of the plaintiff's action against Miss Berry does not, in my opinion, cut any figure in determining liability in this case, wherein the respondent is asserting a direct statutory obligation of the company, as the insurer of Miss Berry, to pay the respondent's judgment up to the face value of the policy.\nI would allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Walsh, Bull, Housser, Tupper & Molson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

Newcombe J. took no part in the judgment, as he died before the delivery thereof.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA EN BANC\nPromissory note\u2014Consideration\u2014Alleged agreement not to negotiate after maturity\u2014Admissibility of evidence\u2014Questions for jury\u2014Appeal\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Appeal from order directing new trial\u2014\"Exercise of judicial discretion\u201d (Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 35, s. 38).\nPlaintiff sued upon two promissory notes made by defendant to L. and transferred, after maturity, and not for value, to plaintiff. They were renewals for the balance unpaid of a previous note from defendant to L. There was conflicting evidence as to the reason and consideration for giving the original note. L. asserted that the note was given for the amount owing to him by defendant on a loan. Defendant asserted that the note was for L.\u2019s accommodation; that the loan from L., asserted by L. to have been made to defendant, had in fact been made to one R., that subsequently L. wanted the money, R. could not then pay, that defendant gave the note (for the same amount as that owing by R.) to enable L. to raise money, but received no consideration, that it was agreed that defendant was not to be called upon to pay the note or any renewals, and that the note or any renewals would not be negotiated after maturity. The trial judge withdrew the case from the jury and gave judgment for plaintiff, holding that any verdict, other than that the original note was given in consideration either of a loan by L. to defendant or of a debt due by R. to L. (the taking of the note in such case involving a forbearance or suspension of L.\u2019s remedy against R.) could not be sustained, and that, in either case, defendant was liable. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc (by a majority) ordered a new trial. Plaintiff appealed.\nHeld, affirming judgment of the Court en banc (3 M.P.R. 507), that there should be a new trial, as the questions whether the note was given simply for L.\u2019s accommodation or in consideration of a debt due by defendant or by R., and whether there was an agreement, as alleged by defendant, that the note should not be negotiated after maturity, should have been submitted to the jury. Parol evidence is admissible to shew that a promissory note was given without consideration, even though it contains the words \u201cvalue received.\u201d In the present case, should it be found as a fact on parol evidence that the note was given simply for L.\u2019s accommodation, the action must be dismissed, as plaintiff stood in no better position than L.\nExtension of time for payment of a debt owing by a third person may be a good consideration from the payee to the maker of a promissory note. But in the present case, on the evidence, the jury, while they might have found, were not bound to find, that there was given such an extension of time in consideration of the note. A person, unable for the time being to collect from a debtor, may arrange with another to take that other\u2019s note for the same amount for his own accommodation, without thereby extending the time for payment by his debtor, and without imposing liability to him on the maker.\nEven should the jury find that the note was given for a valuable consideration, but should find that the alleged agreement existed not to negotiate it after maturity, plaintiff\u2019s (though not L.\u2019s) right to recover would be defeated. Oral evidence of such an agreement was admissible.\nPer Lamont J.: Evidence of an oral agreement that the maker of a note is not to pay it at maturity, or that it is to be renewed, is not admissible.\nHeld, also, that this Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal; the order of the Court en banc directing a new trial was not one \u201cmade in the exercise of judicial discretion\u201d within the meaning of s. 38 of the Supreme Court Act (discussion as to when or when not an order for a new trial may be said to have been made in the exercise of judicial discretion). Where a party is held entitled to a new trial as a matter of right, the order granting it cannot be said to be made in the exercise of judicial discretion; and it is a matter of right where he is entitled under the law to have the facts of his case determined by the jury and that has been denied him.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[1], setting aside the judgment of Ross J.[2] in favour of the plaintiff, and ordering a new trial.\nThe action was upon two promissory notes. The trial judge, Ross J.2, after hearing the evidence and argument of counsel, withdrew the case from the jury and subsequently filed his decision allowing the plaintiff\u2019s claim with costs. The Supreme Court en banc1 ordered a new trial, holding that the case should not have been withdrawn from the jury. The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported and are indicated in the above head-note. The plaintiff\u2019s appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nThe respondent (defendant) moved by way of appeal from an order of the Registrar affirming the jurisdiction of this Court to hear the appeal, the ground taken by the respondent being that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc ordering a new trial was an order \u201cmade in the exercise of judicial discretion\u201d within the meaning of s. 38 of the Supreme Court Act. Respondent\u2019s motion was dismissed with costs.\nH. P. MacKeen for the appellant.\nA. W. Greene K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Rinfret and Smith JJ. was delivered by\nSmith J.\u2014The respondent, Mitchell, and one Robinovitch, were interested in a joint stock company in the City of Halifax, and one, Lerner, was for a time an employee of the company. In the spring of 1924 Lerner received the sum of $19,000 from St. John, which Lerner in his evidence says he turned over to the respondent, Mitchell, as a loan. Mitchell in his evidence denies that this money was lent to him, and says that he never received any of it, but that Lerner lent it to his (Lerner\u2019s) brother-in-law, Rabinovitch, who, in turn, lent it to the company of which he was manager and chief stockholder. Four thousand dollars was paid to Lerner on this loan, which Mitchell says was paid by Rabinovitch out of the funds of the company. On March 7, 1925, Mitchell gave his promissory note to Lerner for $15,000 which was the amount of the balance then owing on Lerner\u2019s advance of $19,000. Two promissory notes payable to Lerner, one for $10,000, dated July 9, 1925, and the other for $2,500, dated December 23, 1925, were signed by Mitchell, the respondent, and given to Lerner, which are renewals for the balance unpaid of the $15,000 note. After maturity of these two notes Lerner transferred them to the plaintiff, appellant, Glesby, who paid nothing for them and holds them simply for collection on behalf of Lerner. The appellant, therefore, has no higher rights against the respondent than if Lerner himself were the plaintiff. The learned trial judge, at the conclusion of the evidence, withdrew the case from the jury upon the following ground:\nI thought that any verdict of the jury, other than that the note was given either in consideration of an actual loan made by Lerner to defendant or in consideration of the debt due by Rabinovitch to Lerner, could not possibly be sustained. The taking of the note in the latter case involved a forbearance or suspension of plaintiff\u2019s remedy against Rabinovitch and would, it seems to me, constitute a good consideration. On the evidence of the defendant himself and his own witness, Mr. Dickie, it was clear that Lerner was pressing Rabinovitch for his money, and hence the reason for the making of the note by defendant. Russel on Bills, 2nd edit., pp. 203-208; Byles on Bills, 18th edit.; p. 127.\nA promissory note, like any other promise, cannot be enforced, as between the parties, unless there is a consideration for the promise, and it is open to the promisor, by parol evidence, to show the lack of consideration; Abbot v. Hendricks[3]. Here the maker, Mitchell, swears that no money was advanced to him, that he owed Lerner nothing at the time of giving the note, that Lerner\u2019s loan was to Rabinovitch, and that the note was for Lerner\u2019s accommodation. It was open to the jury to believe all this.\nNevertheless, if, in consideration of the note, Lerner agreed to extend the time for payment by Rabinovitch, there was a good consideration. There is no evidence that any such agreement was made in express language and the effect of Mitchell\u2019s evidence is that there was no such agreement. There was, however, the evidence of what was said by Rabinovitch, Lerner and Mitchell in connection with the giving of the note and the jury could, had they seen fit, have drawn from that evidence the inference that there was given such extension of time in consideration of the note, but they were not bound to draw such inference. A party, being unable for the time being to collect a debt due to him from a debtor, may arrange with another to take that other\u2019s promissory note for the same amount for his own accommodation, without thereby extending the time for payment by his debtor, and without imposing liability to him on the maker.\nIt is a question of what the bargain in connection with the giving of the note really was, and where there is a dispute as to what the terms of the bargain were, the fact must be determined, in a jury trial, by the jury.\nThe learned trial judge here withdrew this question from the jury and undertook to decide it for himself under the erroneous impression that on the evidence the question could only be decided in one way, namely, that there was an agreement for extension of time.\nThe respondent, Mitchell, had a legal right to have this question with others passed upon by the jury, and the Appellate Court in granting a new trial was not exercising a discretion but, as in duty bound, was granting to the respondent what was his legal right.\nMitchell in his examination in chief says, \u201cand the note was never to pass out of his hands, not to be placed for collection with anybody else.\u201d\nThen on cross-examination he says that two affidavits made by him and filed as exhibits \u201ctruly set forth the circumstances to which they relate.\u201d\nNext he says, Lerner told him he was going, to raise money on the notes and supposes he would discount them.\nOne of the affidavits filed has the following statement:\nAnd it was expressly agreed between said Lerner and myself that the said note for $15,000 and any renewal or renewals thereof would not at maturity or thereafter be negotiated.\nMitchell\u2019s witness, Dickie, gives a somewhat different story of the conversation about negotiation of the note, but if the evidence was admissible it was open to the jury to find that there was an agreement between Mitchell and Lerner that the note should not be negotiated or transferred after maturity, as it in fact was.\nIt is urged on behalf of the plaintiff, appellant, that this oral evidence was not admissible because it tends to vary the terms of the written instrument.\nThe rule against the acceptance of oral evidence to contradict or vary a promissory note is not different in principle from the rule in reference to other written documents, but there are cases in which, as among parties other than a holder in due course, parol evidence may be given to control what would, in the absence of other evidence, be the effect of the document. Byles on Bills, 19th ed., 104.\nIn the present case, if the jury should find that the note in question was made for the accommodation of Lerner the action must be dismissed, because the plaintiff, having taken the note after maturity without giving any consideration for it, stands in no better position than Lerner himself. If, however, the jury should find that the note was given for a valuable consideration, then the question of the alleged agreement not to negotiate after maturity and of the admissibility of the oral evidence as to such an agreement must be considered.\nThat oral evidence of such an agreement is admissible seems to be settled by authority.\nIn Sturtevant v. Ford[4], Erskine J. says:\nThe circumstance that the bill was overdue might have operated as evidence that the bill was an accommodation bill, but it should have been so averred. A jury might infer that the bill was accepted upon an understanding that it was not to be negotiated after it became due. But that would not be an inference of law; it should therefore have been made the subject of an averment.\nHe is evidently speaking of an inference to be drawn from oral evidence.\nIn Parr v. Jewell[5], the judgment is as follows:\nThe court are unanimously of opinion in this case,\u2014and after some little doubt at first entertained by one of its members,\u2014that there should be a venre de novo. The case mainly relied on for the defendant in error was that of Charles v. Marsden[6], where it was held, that it is not a defence to an action by the indorsee of a bill of exchange, to plead that it was accepted for the accommodation of the drawer, without consideration, and was indorsed over after it became due. But, in that case, the question arose upon the pleadings; whereas, here it is presented upon the evidence. And we think that, under the circumstances stated in this bill of exceptions, there was evidence for the jury of an engagement on the part of Allen not to negotiate the bill mentioned in the second count after it became due; therefore, without going further into the case, it is enough to say that there must be a venire de novo.\nThe evidence there referred to was oral evidence. Platt \u0412., in the course of the argument, says, \u201cThe fact of its being an accommodation bill is evidence for a jury that it was given for the purpose of being used before it should become due,\u201d and again, \u201cHere it is a question of evidence.\u201d\nIn these cases their Lordships were dealing with an accommodation note, but an accommodation note is a written document just as a note for value is a written document and the same principle as to admissibility of oral evidence of a collateral agreement in connection with the one must be applied to the other though the effect of such an agreement may be different according to circumstances. In the present case the effect of the agreement, if the jury should find that it existed, is to defeat this plaintiff\u2019s right to recover but not Lerner\u2019s right to recover if the note was for value.\nIt is, of course, always competent in such a case for the court to substitute or add as plaintiff, with his consent, the proper party to sue, and, if justice requires it, to impose terms.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nThe motion must also be dismissed with costs.\nLamont J.\u2014In this action the appellant sues on two promissory notes, one for $10,000, dated July 9, 1925, and due 90 days after date, and the other for $2,500, dated December 23, 1925, and due one month after date and on which there was a balance claimed of $1,000. Both notes were made by the respondent in favour of \u041c. H. Lerner, and were renewals of the amount unpaid on a note for $15,000, dated March 7, 1925, between the same parties. The defences of the respondent are:\u2014\n1. That the original note was given for the accommodation of Lerner and the respondent received no consideration therefor, and\n2. That the renewal notes were negotiated to the plaintiff after maturity and in breach of an agreement between the respondent and Lerner that neither the note nor any renewal thereof would be negotiated after maturity.\nAt the trial the appellant did not give evidence but Lerner admitted that the appellant acquired the notes after maturity.\nThe story of the respondent is that in the spring of 1924 Lerner, his brother-in-law H. Rabinovitch, Rabinovitch\u2019s brother and himself were all interested in the Franco-Canadian Import Company; that the company was controlled by Harry Rabinovitch, but that he (respondent) was the financial man behind it and that the company\u2019s moneys were kept in a bank in a special account in his name, and that he was the one who signed cheques on behalf of the company; that during that spring Lerner received a bank manager\u2019s cheque for $19,000, his share of another trans- action, which cheque was indorsed over to Rabinovitch who put it into the Franco-Canadian Import Company\u2019s business, and that the transaction constituted a loan from Lerner to Rabinovitch. The respondent further says that in November, 1924, the company paid to Lerner $4,000 on the loan; that shortly afterwards Lerner left the company\u2019s employ but before leaving he demanded from Rabinovitch the payment of $15,000, the balance of the loan; that Rabinovitch had not the money, nor could the company furnish it; that Rabinovitch offered Lerner his note but that Lerner said he was going west to start in business and he could not use either the note of Rabinovitch or that of the company, but that he could use the respondent\u2019s note. The respondent says that, after some consideration, he agreed to give Lerner a note to enable him to obtain money to start in business in the west but received no consideration therefor and it was understood and agreed that he was not to be called upon to pay it as it was not a debt of his, but that Rabinovitch or the company would meet it at maturity, or, if they could not, it would be renewed on the same terms.\nLerner\u2019s story is very different. He says that when the cheque for $19,000 came to him the respondent asked for the loan of the money; that he indorsed the cheque and handed it to the respondent; that $4,000 had been paid upon it by respondent\u2019s cheque, \u201cpossibly on the special account,\u201d and that when he was leaving for the west he asked the respondent for the balance of the loan; that the respondent said he did not have the money but would give him a note for it, which he did. He said that Rabinovitch had not borrowed the money and did not owe it to him, and he makes no suggestion that he loaned it to the company.\nThe $19,000 cheque was not produced at the trial nor was Rabinovitch called to give evidence.\nAnother witness, one Fred W. Dickie, who for a time had been secretary of the company, testified that at the time Lerner was leaving for the west, he, Lerner and Rabinovitch were in the office together when there was a discussion between Lerner and Rabinovitch as to the repayment of the balance of the $19,000 loan made to Rabinovitch. Rabinovitch said he did not have the money and that the company could not raise it, but that he would give Lerner his note. Lerner was not willing to take his note, and just then the respondent came in and there was a general discussion in which the respondent was asked to sign or indorse a note, which at first he did not want to do, but finally agreed to do so on the understanding that it was to be paid by Rabinovitch or the company and that it would not be negotiated in a Halifax bank.\nOn the above evidence the trial judge withdrew the case from the jury on the ground that any verdict given by them, other than that the original note was given in consideration of a loan made by Lerner to the respondent or in consideration of a debt due by Rabinovitch to Lerner, could not be sustained and that, in either case, the respondent would be liable. He therefore gave judgment for the plaintiff. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, the court, by a majority, ordered a new trial, thinking that the case should have been left to the jury. From that decision this appeal is brought.\nThe appellant\u2019s first contention was that, if the jury accepted Lerner\u2019s evidence that the notes were given in consideration of a loan from Lerner to the respondent, judgment for the appellant would follow. The soundness of this proposition is admitted by the respondent.\nThe appellant\u2019s next contention was that, if the jury disregarded Lerner\u2019s evidence, no verdict, other than that the notes were given in consideration of a debt due by Rabinovitch to Lerner, could be sustained, and that, if given for such consideration, the defence based on the ground that it was an accommodation note must fail.\nIn support of this contention the appellant referred to Byles on Bills, 19th ed., at page 129, where the learned author says:\u2014\nA subsisting debt due from a third person is a good consideration for a bill or note, at least if the instrument is payable at a future day, for then it amounts to an agreement to give time to the original debtor, and that indulgence to him is a consideration to the maker.\nThis statement of the law is quoted with approval by this court in Gallagher v. Murphy[7].\nIn Allen v. Royal Bank of Canada[8], Lord Atkinson, in giving the judgment of the Privy Council, said:\u2014 In the last edition of Byles on Bills, that is, the edition of 1923, at p. 232, the rule of the law is stated in these terms: \u201cIf a bill or note be taken on account of a debt and nothing be said at the time, the legal effect of the transaction is this\u2014that the original debt still remains, but the remedy for it is suspended till maturity of the instrument in the hands of the creditor.\u201d And the remedy is equally suspended if the bill or note be given, not by the debtor, but by a stranger.\nWith these statements of the law the respondent has no quarrel. He does quarrel, however, with their application to this case. He contends that here there could be no agreement, express or implied, to extend the time for payment by Rabinovitch of his debt, nor any forbearance to sue him, because Lerner himself swore that Rabinovitch did not borrow the money and was not indebted to him in respect thereof. If Rabinovitch was not indebted to Lerner, Lerner\u2019s acceptance of the respondent\u2019s note could not amount to an agreement to give time to Rabinovitch, which is the only consideration suggested for the respondent\u2019s note, other than that he borrowed the money himself.\nIn his notes the trial judge says:\u2014\nI thought that any verdict of the jury, other than that the note was given either in consideration of an actual loan made by Lerner to defendant or in consideration of the debt due by Rabinovitch to Lerner, could not possibly be sustained. The taking of the note in the latter case involved a forbearance or suspension of plaintiff\u2019s remedy against Rabinovitch and would, it seems to me, constitute a good consideration. On the evidence of the defendant himself and his own witness, Mr. Dickie, it was clear that Lerner was pressing Rabinovitch for his money and hence the reason for the making of the note by defendant.\nIt is quite clear that the trial judge did not believe Lerner when he swore that he had loaned the money to the respondent, and it may be that the jury would not have believed him either, but, even so, they might have had difficulty in ascribing to Lerner \u201ca suspension or forbearance of his remedy against Rabinovitch\u201d in the face of his own sworn statement that Rabinovitch did not owe him any money. Apart from that, however, the respondent argues that if the jury had rejected Lerner\u2019s evidence they were not driven to find that the note was given for Rabinovitch\u2019s indebtedness; that they had another alternative, testified to by the respondent, namely, that the note was given simply for the accommodation of Lerner to enable him to raise money with which to start business in the west and on the understanding that the respondent was not to be called upon to pay it, but that it was to be paid by others, and if they did not meet it at maturity, it was to be renewed.\nAs against this, the appellant contends that evidence of an oral agreement that the respondent was not to be called upon to pay the note or that it would be renewed or was not to be negotiated, is inadmissible as it would contradict or vary the terms of the written contract contained in the note.\nIn my opinion, evidence of an oral agreement that the maker of a note is not to pay it at maturity, or that it is to be renewed, is inadmissible. New London Credit Syndicate v. Nedle[9]; Young v. Austen[10]; Abrey v. Crux[11]. The terms of the contract contained in each of the notes sued on are that at a certain time after date the respondent will pay to \u041c. H. Lerner the sum therein set out at the place therein specified. Parol evidence to contradict these terms is not admissible. Parol evidence, however, is admissible to shew that the original note was given without consideration even although it contained, as do the renewals, the words \u201cvalue received.\u201d Taylor on Evidence, 11th ed., 780 and 781.\nIn Phipson on Evidence, 7th ed., at page 563, the author says:\u2014\nWant or failure of consideration may, under proper pleadings, always be proved to impeach a written agreement not under seal, even though, as in the case of bills and notes, the words \u201cfor value received\u201d are inserted.\nAnd in Barton v. Bank of New South Wales[12], the Privy Council stated the law as follows:\u2014\nWhere there is simply a conveyance and nothing more, the terms upon which the conveyance is made not being apparent from the deed itself, collateral evidence may easily be admitted to supply the considerations for which the parties interchanged such a deed; but where in the deed itself the reasons for making it, and the considerations for which it is granted, are fully and clearly expressed, the collateral evidence must be strong enough to overcome the presumption that the parties in making the deed had truly set forth the causes which led to its execution.\nIn Falconbridge on Banking and Bills of Exchange, 4th ed., at page 662, the rule is summed up in these words:\u2014\nEvery party whose signature appears on a bill is prima facie deemed to have become a party thereto for value (s. 58), but evidence may be given of absence of consideration, or its failure, total or partial. In my opinion, the words \u201cvalue received\u201d do not constitute a term of the contract the varying or altering of which by parol evidence is prohibited by the rules. They are no more than an acknowledgment or receipt which in general is only prima facie evidence, and does not prevent the real consideration from being shewn. Original absence of consideration for the giving of a note is a matter of defence against an immediate party or a remote party who is not a holder for value. Bills of Exchange Act, s. 55 (2). Parol evidence was, therefore, admissible to shew that the note was given simply for the accommodation of Lerner.\nThere is no evidence before us that the appellant was a holder for value. In the statement of claim it is not alleged that he was, and his counsel admitted on the argument that he could not stand in any better position than Lerner himself had be brought the action. If, therefore, it should be found as a fact that the note was given simply for Lerner\u2019s accommodation, it would, in my opinion, be a good defence, for where an accommodation note is paid in due course by the party accommodated, the note is discharged. Bills of Exchange Act, sections 139 and 186. And if Lerner ever discounted the renewals, he must have paid them himself at maturity for they were in his possession when he indorsed them after maturity to the appellant. The duty of determining whether the note was given simply for Lerner\u2019s accommodation or in consideration of a debt due by the respondent or by Rabinovitch, was a matter for the jury and, in my opinion, the trial judge erred in withdrawing the case from them.\nThe respondent also raises a further point. In his affidavit put in as evidence by the appellant, he states as follows:\u2014\nAnd it was expressly agreed between said Lerner and myself that the said note for $15,000 and any renewal or renewals thereof would not at maturity or thereafter be negotiated as I did not want said original note or renewal notes to fall into the hands of any person or persons for collection.\nIf the note was given pursuant to such an agreement, its negotiation, in breach of the agreement, would, in my opinion, constitute a defence against the plaintiff. In MacArthur v. MacDowall[13], Mr. Justice Patterson says: The plaintiff took a note which was overdue and which was an accommodation note. The circumstance that it was an accommodation note would not in itself interfere with the negotiation of it after it was due; but, being overdue, the plaintiff could take it only as subject to its equities. An agreement not to negotiate an accommodation note after it was due would be such an equity. We find that asserted in a series of cases from Charles v. Marsden[14] downwards. All the cases on the subject, as late as the year 1868, will be found commented on by Mallins V.C. in Ex parte Swan[15], in a dissertation which may be referred to in place of citing the various cases.\nSee also Falconbridge on Banking and Bills of Exchange, at page 663; Byles on Bills, 19th ed., page 178.\nIf the note was not given for value the fact that it was given pursuant to such an agreement is immaterial. But if it be found that the note was given for value, and also found that it was given pursuant to the alleged agreement, the action would fail unless Lerner were made a party plaintiff. Whether or not there was such an agreement is a question of fact to be determined by the jury.\nThe respondent launched a motion to quash the appeal. That motion was based upon the contention that this court had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the order directing a new trial was made by the court in banco in the exercise of its judicial discretion, and from such an order no appeal lies to this court.\nThe relevant sections of the Act are sections 36 and 38, which read:\u2014\n36. Subject to sections thirty-eight and thirty-nine hereof, an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment of the highest court of final resort now or hereafter established in any province of Canada pronounced in a judicial proceeding, whether such court is a court of appeal or of original jurisdiction (except in criminal causes and in proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari or prohibition arising out of a criminal charge, or in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus arising out of any claim for extradition made under any treaty) where such judgment is,\n(a) \u0430 final judgment; or\n(b) a judgment granting a motion for a nonsuit or directing a new trial.\n38. No appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment or order made in the exercise of judicial discretion except in proceedings in the nature of a suit or proceeding in equity originating elsewhere than in the province of Quebec.\nAn appeal, therefore, lies to this court from an order directing a new trial made by the highest court of final resort in a province unless the order was made by the court in the exercise of its judicial discretion.\nWe were not directed to any case in which this court laid down the test by which to determine when an order for a new trial would be appealable under section 36, and not appealable as made, in the exercise of judicial discretion. The circumstances of each case must be considered. One thing, however, is clear, and that is, that where a party in whose favour the order is made is entitled to a new trial as a matter of right, the new trial cannot be said to have been made in the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion. Where a party is entitled under the law to have the facts of his case determined by the jury and that has been denied to him, he is entitled to a new trial as a matter of right.\nOn the other hand, where a new trial is directed because the first trial was unsatisfactory, whether from a failure on the part of the jury to so answer the questions as to enable the court to dispose of the rights of the parties, or where the evidence has left material matters in a state of uncertainty, the order for a new trial may be said to have been made in the exercise of judicial discretion. On this point the following authorities are instructive: Barrington v. The Scottish Union and National Ins. Co.[16]; Accident Insurance Company of North America v. McLachlan[17]; Town of Aurora v. Village of Markham[18]; Canada Carriage Company v. Lea[19].\nThe respondent\u2019s motion should be dismissed with costs, as should also the appellant\u2019s appeal.\nCannon J.\u2014The plaintiff, appellant, recovered judgment before the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia as endorsee against the defendant, respondent, as maker of two promissory notes dated the 9th day of July, 1925, and the 23rd December, 1925, for $10,000 and $2,500 respectively, in favour of one Moses Harry Lerner and endorsed by him to the appellant. An amended defence was filed on the 24th February, 1930, in which the respondent pleaded in effect:\n(a) that the notes sued on were given for the accommodation of Lerner, the respondent receiving no consideration therefor; (b) that the said notes were negotiated to the appellant after maturity, in breach of an agreement between the respondent and Lerner, made in April, 1925, whereby it was agreed that the said notes should not be negotiated after maturity.\nThe appellant appealed from the order allowing the amendment, on the ground that the respondent\u2019s own affidavit, used in support of his application to amend, showed that the amended defences were false and no answer to respondent\u2019s claim.\nThe court in banco (Harris C.J. and Paton J. dissenting) dismissed the appeal; and Mellish J., with whom Chisholm and Graham JJ. concurred, said:\nThe amended defence allowed by Mr. Justice Ross in chambers is to the effect that the note sued on was given for the accommodation of the payee who negotiated it after maturity. This defence is, I think, a good one if established and I do not think it is disproved by the evidence before us.\nThe appeal should therefore be dismissed with costs.\nThe case then proceeded on the merits before the Honourable Mr. Justice Ross, with a jury. The presiding judge withdrew the case from the jury and gave judgment for plaintiff for the following reasons:\nAt the conclusion of the trial and on the application of counsel for the plaintiff I withdrew the case from the jury as I was of opinion that there was no evidence on which the jury could properly find in favour of the defendant. Whether the note was given in consideration of a loan made by Lerner to the defendant or in consideration of the debt due by Rabinovitch to Lerner, in either case the defendant would be liable. I thought that any verdict of the jury, other than that the note was given either in consideration of an actual loan made by Lemer to defendant or in consideration of the debt due by Rabinovitch to Lerner, could not possibly be sustained. The taking of the note in the latter case involved a forbearance or suspension of plaintiff\u2019s remedy against Rabinovitch and would it seems to me constitute a good consideration. On the evidence of the defendant himself and his own witness, Mr. Dickie, it was clear that Lerner was pressing Rabinovitch for his money and hence the reason for the making of the note by defendant. Russell on Bills, 2nd edit., pp. 203-208; Byles on Bills, 18th edit., p. 127. Plaintiff will have judgment for his claim with costs.\nDefendant gave notice of appeal and asked for an order setting aside the decision of the trial judge and directing a new trial with a jury. The case came a second time before the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, and defendant\u2019s demand for a new trial was granted by Mellish, Graham and Carroll JJ., Paton and Chisholm JJ., dissenting. This second judgment of the appellate court of Nova Scotia is now before us.\nThe jurisdiction of this court was affirmed by the Registrar, and notice of appeal from his decision was duly given and the respondent moves to quash the appeal under section 38 of the Supreme Court Act, upon the ground that the judgment or order of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia directing a new trial was made in the exercise of judicial discretion.\nSection 36 (b) of our Act gives an appeal to this court from any judgment of the highest court of final resort in any province of Canada directing a new trial, subject, however, to sections 38 and 39. The requirements of section 39 as to the amount in controversy in the appeal are assumed to be fulfilled in the present case; the only question raised by the motion is whether or not the judgment directing a new trial was made in the exercise of judicial discretion.\nOrder LVII of the Nova Scotia Judicature Act, paragraph 5, enacts:\n* * * The court shall have power to draw inferences of fact, and to give any judgment and make any order which ought to have been made, and to make such further or other order as the case requires. * * *\n6. If upon the hearing of an appeal, it appears to the court that a new trial ought to be had, it shall be lawful for the court to order that the verdict and judgment be set aside, and that a new trial be had.\nThe following is found in Stroud\u2019s Judicial Dictionary, second edition, verbo Discretion, pp. 541-542:\n\u201cThere be several degrees of Discretion,\u2014Discretio generalis, Discretio legalis, Discretio specialis,\u2014\n\u201cDiscretio generalis, is required of every one in everything that he is to do, or attempt;\n\u201cLegalis discretio, is that which Sir E. Coke meaneth and setteth forth in Rooke\u2019s and Keighley\u2019s Cases[20], and this is merely to administer justice according to the prescribed rules of the law;\n\u201cThe third Discretion is where the laws have given no certain rule \u2026 and herein Discretion is the absolute judge of the cause, and gives the rule.\u201d\n* * *\nYou cannot lay down a hard-and-fast rule as to the exercise of Judicial Discretion, for the moment you do that \u201cthe discretion of the Judge is fettered\u201d (per Brett, M.R., The Fr\u00ededeberg[21]; Vf, per Bowen, L.J., Jones v. Curling[22]. Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, Rawle\u2019s Third Revision, verbo Discretion, says:\nThat part of the judicial function which decides questions arising in the trial of a cause, according to the particular circumstances of each case, and as to which the judgment of the court is uncontrolled by fixed rules of law.\nThe power exercised by courts to determine questions to which no strict rule of law is applicable but which, from their nature, and the circumstances of the case, are controlled by the personal judgment of the court.\nIn National Life Assurance Company v. McCoubrey[23], the present Chief Justice of this court, in discussing section 38, stated that\nthe judge in chambers (in granting speedy judgment), and the Court of Appeal in affirming him, necessarily determined judicially that the matters urged in answer to the plaintiff\u2019s plea were devoid of merit and afforded no substantial ground of defence. Such a decision and the order giving effect to it are not discretionary, although an order dismissing a motion for judgment, if based on the view that the suggested defences disclose matter which should be disposed of after trial rather than summarily upon motion, may be discretionary as well as not final.\nThis pronouncement, which was the unanimous judgment of this court composed of Anglin C.J.C., and Idington, Duff, Mignault and Newcombe JJ., should help us to determine the merits of the motion to quash. Can the judgment a quo be considered as given \u201cproprio motu\u201d by the appeal court under section 6 of the above Rule, or is it simply the giving, on legal grounds, of the order which ought to have been made by the trial judge? It is, I believe, the exercise of the power and duty of the court to enforce the rule that the jury must be allowed to pass on the facts as alleged by the parties, when the pleadings disclose a good defence in law and there is evidence to support it. Let us examine the reasons given by the majority judges of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. Have they determined judicially that the matters urged in answer to the action afforded a substantial ground of defence?\nMr. Justice Mellish says, in part:\nThis is an amended defence allowed in Chambers by Mr. Justice Ross. This court last year refused to strike out this defence as false on an appeal from that judge\u2019s decision allowing the amendment, the court being of opinion that the case should go to trial on the issues on the record.\nThe action came on for trial before Mr. Justice Ross with a jury. After the evidence was taken, he decided there was no case for the jury and gave judgment for the plaintiff. I think the case should have been left to the jury.\nWe are bound by our previous decision and I think the evidence given on the trial strengthens it.\nThe term \u201caccommodation note\u201d was freely used by some of the witnesses without perhaps precisely realizing what it meant. There is a good deal of evidence that the notes were not to be negotiated at any time, and a jury, I think, would be quite justified in so finding, and if the notes were given without consideration such evidence would be quite admissible whether they were accommodation notes or not in the ordinary sense. Of course, as ordinarily understood, an accommodation note is intended to be negotiated before maturity but a note given as security for another man\u2019s debt may be without consideration and evidence, I think, can be adduced as against an overdue holder to show this and that the note was not to be negotiated. These questions are, I think, open on the evidence and have not been tried. The Defendant, whether legally bound to do so or not, recognized his liability to Lerner on the notes, but repudiated liability when they were negotiated. There must be consideration for a contract of guarantee or suretyship and there is, I think, none proven here.\nThere remains a further question which does not appear to have ever been decided, viz: whether the defence can be successfully maintained, by the maker as against the overdue holder from the payee of a note for good consideration, that it was negotiated, when overdue, in breach of an oral agreement entered into when the note was made between the maker and the payee. The answer to this, I think, depends upon whether evidence of such an agreement is admissible, and I have come to the conclusion that evidence of an oral agreement not to negotiate a note after it becomes due is admissible as it does not contradict the terms of the note.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and a new trial ordered.\nMr. Justice Graham agreed that there should be a new trial. These two learned judges exercised not a discretion, but considered themselves bound by their previous decision and their interpretation of certain rules of law.\nAnd Mr. Justice Carroll:\nI think, with deference, that there was a question which should have been submitted to the jury, namely: Was there an agreement between Mitchell and Lerner that the note or notes should not be negotiated after maturity? I think there is not any doubt that if the note was an accommodation that such an agreement is an equity which attaches to the note in the hands of a holder who takes it after maturity. MacArthur v. MacDowali[24]; Grant v. Winstanley[25].\n* * *\nOn the appeal or motion for a new trial defendant\u2019s counsel took the objection that the evidence concerning the agreement was not admissible in that it added to or changed the contract evidenced in writing by the note. This objection was not taken before the trial judge, but in any event I am of opinion that the rule regarding oral extrinsic evidence is not applicable here, as the evidence complained of here is introduced to prove a distinct collateral agreement, which I think is not inconsistent with the agreement set out in the written document.\nI think there should be a new trial to determine the issue of facts outstanding.\nThere again, in my opinion, we find the judicial determination of legal questions and not the mere exercise of discretionary power. Paton J., who also dissented in the first appeal, held that evidence of a verbal agreement not\u2019 to negotiate a time note is not admissible, as it contradicts the express words of the note. Here we have the application of the law, as understood by the learned Justice, and not the exercise of any discretionary power. I take it that the obvious sense of these words in section 38 refers not to \u201cdiscretio legalis\u201d as described in the first part of these notes, but to judgments rendered by a court, not according to fixed rules of law, but in the exercise of the power of acting, in certain cases and within certain limits, according to its will. And even in such cases, this court would be entitled, before granting a motion to quash under section 38, to reserve the motion until after hearing the merits of the appeal, in order to see, \u201cthat a case for the exercising of the judge\u2019s discretion has been raised by the evidence.\u201d See Williams v. Guest[26]. We cannot, therefore, grant the motion to quash the appeal and it should be dismissed with costs.\nBesides, on the merits of the judgment a quo, I clearly reach the conclusion, with my brother Smith, that the trial judge was wrong in deciding that there were no facts to submit to the jury.\nContradictory evidence by respondent and Dickie on one side and Lerner on the other having been given as to the facts, the respondent, under his plea, as previously approved by the Court of Appeal, was entitled, as a matter of right, to have this evidence weighed by the jury and to secure a definite finding as to these facts. If no evidence had been given to support the plea, the case might have been properly withdrawn; but such a situation does not exist here. The issues cannot be satisfactorily disposed of, according to the record of this case, in the summary manner adopted by the learned trial judge.

Appellant carried on a business of obtaining and giving information as to credit, character, etc., and including the checking of cars in dealers\u2019 hands and reporting thereon. Appellant made an agreement to supply its service to respondent. Respondent signed an \u201cindemnity agreement,\u201d agreeing to treat in confidence the information furnished, to hold appellant harmless on account of any damages arising from publication or dissemination of information or careless handling of reports, and agreeing, \u201cin consideration of receiving this service, and as a condition of its rendition,\u201d that neither the appellant nor its employees should be responsible \u201cfor any loss that may occur to [respondent] through the use of the information furnished.\u201d Through careless car-checking reports (made without personally checking over the cars) in respect of a dealer, made by a local inspection agent of appellant and passed on to respondent, the respond- ent was misled, to its loss, and sued appellant for damages. Appellant claimed that it had not bound itself for more than reasonable care in the selection of its inspection agents, and, further, that, in any case, it was relieved from liability by the concluding clause (above quoted) of the indemnity agreement.\nHeld, affirming judgment of the Appellate Division, Ont. (66 Ont. L.R. 10), that respondent should recover. The concluding clause of the indemnity agreement did not, on proper construction of that agreement, relate to car-checking reports. (Anglin, C.J.C., held that either this was the proper construction or, if the clause relied on by appellant extended to the entire service to be rendered including the checking of cars, etc., the words \u201cIn consideration of receiving this service\u201d must likewise so extend, in which case, the service never having been rendered, the consideration failed and there was nothing to support the indemnity clause).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1].\nThe plaintiff (respondent) company, whose business included automobile financing, sued, in one action, the Merchants Casualty Insurance Co., and, in another action, the Western Assurance Co., claiming under certain alleged insurance coverage or indemnification agreements against loss through wrongful conversion of motor vehicles on which the plaintiff held any security for unpaid purchase money or through fraud by the dealer or purchaser in connection therewith. In each action the defendant, besides contesting the plaintiff\u2019s claim, brought in the Retail Credit Co., Inc., by third party notice, claiming relief over against it. The latter company (the appellant in the present appeal) was subsequently, on motion on behalf of the plaintiff, made a party defendant. The plaintiff claimed against the Retail Credit Co., Inc., (and this was the main subject of the present appeal) for damages for alleged failure, in breach of its agreement with the plaintiff, to check motor cars and make proper reports, in respect of a certain dealer, who was thus enabled to convert certain motor cars to his own use, to the plaintiff\u2019s loss.\nThe actions were tried together before Garrow J. who[2] gave judgment in favour of the plaintiff against all the defendants, subject, in certain respects, to references which he directed. He dismissed the claims of the defendant insurance companies made by way of third party proceedings, holding that neither had shewn that there was a contract, express or implied, between it and the defendant the Retail Credit Co., Inc.; but he declared and adjudged that each of the defendant insurance companies, upon payment of the whole or any part of the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, should be entitled to subrogation to the rights of the plaintiff as against the defendant the Retail Credit Co., Inc., to the extent of such payment.\nThe said judgment of Garrow J. was affirmed by the Appellate Division[3], with a variation allowing to the plaintiff certain claims (made by cross-appeal) for interest as against the defendant insurance companies.\nThe defendant the Retail Credit Co., Inc., appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The defendant insurance companies, while supporting the judgment of the Appellate Division, appealed conditionally against the plaintiff, giving notice that, in the event of the appeal of the Retail Credit Co., Inc., being successful, they would contend that, if the plaintiff did give a special contract or release or indemnity to the Retail Credit Co., Inc., which had the effect of relieving the latter in whole or in part from its liability to the plaintiff, it did so without the knowledge or consent, express or implied, of the insurance companies, and thereby prejudiced their rights and released and discharged them also.\nThe appeal of the Retail Credit Co., Inc., to this Court was dismissed.\nThe material facts of the case, for the purposes of the judgment in the present appeal, are sufficiently stated in the judgment of Newcombe J., now reported.\nI.F. Hellmuth K.C. and J.R. Cartwright for the appellant.\nGideon Grant K.C., H.R. Frost K.C., and Fraser Grant for the respondent Commercial Finance Corporation, Ltd.\nGordon N. Shaver K.C. for the respondent Merchants Casualty Insurance Co.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and F.J. Hughes K.C. for the respondent Western Assurance Co. ANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the carefully prepared opinion of my brother Newcombe, I agree in his conclusions and, generally, in the reasons on which he bases them.\nThe appellant certainly never rendered the service contracted for to the respondent in regard to the checking of cars, etc. To invoke an indemnity clause as excusing nonperformance, by the appellant, of a distinct obligation undertaken by it, or, rather, as saving it from liability for the consequences of that non-performance, seems to me absurd. Either, as my brother Newcombe thinks, the indemnity provision was restricted in its operation to the obligations specifically referred to in the two earlier paragraphs of the document containing it, and, in that event, it does not advance the appellant\u2019s case, inasmuch as the two earlier paragraphs are restricted to obligations other than that here in question; or, the third paragraph, which is the indemnity clause, extends to the entire service to be rendered including the checking of the cars, etc., and, if that be the case, its introductory words, \u201cIn consideration of receiving this service \u201cmust likewise so extend. In that event, the service never having been rendered, the consideration failed and there is nothing to support the indemnity clause.\nFrom any point of view, it is surely absurd for the appellant to invoke a provision for indemnity which, construed as it would construe it, would have the effect of rendering nugatory a distinct obligation undertaken by it.\nThe judgment of Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014This litigation was determined, both at the trial[4] and in the Appellate Division of Ontario4, adversely to the appellant company, which now brings up two alleged errors for review. The material facts are not in dispute. The appeal depends upon the meaning of the agreement between The Retail Credit Company Incorporated and The Commercial Finance Corporation, Limited; and these two companies are the principal parties. The understanding of the agreement is to be derived from the conversation which took place in July, 1925, between Mr. Hill, the appellant\u2019s vice-president, and Mr. O\u2019Grady, the general manager of the Finance Corporation; and from the written document, without date, described as \u201cIndemnity Agreement,\u201d and known in the case as plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 9, which Mr. Hill passed to Mr. O\u2019Grady at the latter\u2019s office at Toronto, on 27th July, and which Mr. O\u2019Grady then executed on behalf of the Finance Corporation; there is also evidence of the subsequent course of business pursued by the parties in their relations to each other.\nThe trouble has arisen through the dishonesty of one Raynor, who carried on a large trade in buying and selling automobiles at Belleville and Picton, and the fault of Mr. O\u2019Flynn, the appellant\u2019s agent at Belleville.\nThe Finance Corporation dealt in lien notes and security agreements, covering motor vehicles, and was accustomed to make advances upon such securities and to finance the dealers when satisfied with the security offered. Raynor became one of its customers. The course of dealing between them and other particulars are briefly described in the first four paragraphs of the appellant\u2019s factum:\n\u201cHe (Raynor) would purchase cars from the manufacturer and the same would be shipped to Belleville or Picton consigned to the order of the manufacturer to be delivered to Raynor on payment of the invoice price. Upon being notified of the shipment Raynor, under the arrangement with the plaintiff, would go to the bank of the plaintiff at Belleville, execute a promissory note, usually at three months, for the amount of the purchase, less ten per cent., which he paid himself, execute also a bill of sale of the car or cars in question to the plaintiff company and complete at the same time a conditional sale agreement by which the plaintiff company agreed to re-sell to him the vehicles covered by the shipment the title to the cars remaining in the plaintiff company until payment. With these completed documents he was then in a position to draw upon the plaintiff company for the amount of the balance of the purchase price, attaching these documents to his draft. The draft was honoured by the bank and with the proceeds Raynor released the shipment from the railway company and got possession of the cars.\n\u201c2. It was part of the arrangement between Raynor and the plaintiff that on or before selling any car covered by such documents he should pay for the same to the plaintiff, it being considered that a purchaser from Raynor in the ordinary course of business would acquire a title good against the plaintiff.\n\u201c3. It was the practice of the plaintiff to have an investigation made from time to time to ascertain that all cars upon which it held security were still in the possession of Raynor.\n\u201cIn or about the month of October, 1926, the work of checking these cars was entrusted to the appellant Retail Credit Company, Incorporated.\n\u201c4. The appellant Retail Credit Company, Incorporated, carries on the business of obtaining and giving information of various kinds as to credit, character and so forth including the business of checking cars in cases where arrangements have been made similar to those made in this case between the plaintiff company and Raynor.\u201d\nSome extracts from the testimony of Mr. O\u2019Grady and of Mr. Hill may be conveniently introduced. Mr. O\u2019Grady, who is the plaintiff\u2019s leading witness, in his cross-examination says:\nBy Mr. Hellmuth:\nQ. Mr. O\u2019Grady, you met Mr. Hill of the Retail Credit first of all in Muskoka?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. I suggest to you that was on Saturday, the 25th day of July, 1925?\u2014A. I think so.\nQ. And on the Monday following, which would be the 27th day of July, you and Mr. Hill met together at your office\u201410 King Street West, is it?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. In Toronto. And Mr. Hill proposed to you that you should take advantage of the services that his company could render?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. That is correct?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. I think you have practically said that. At that time the suggestion was that he should furnish you\u2014or, rather, his company should furnish you\u2014with character reports on purchasers of automobiles, wholesale reports, car checks and reports on dealers?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. That is what you said in chief; I have got the words that you used?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And an agreement was come to that he or his company should do that as and when you might request these reports?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And no other agreement at any time was made by you or your company with the Retail Credit?\u2014A. I think not.\nQ. You know of none; you said so before?\u2014A. Yes.\nMr. Hill, the appellant\u2019s principal witness, gives the following testimony in chief:\nMr. GRANT: Q. Mr. Hill, would you mind speaking just a little louder?\u2014A. I called on Mr. O\u2019Grady following a suggestion made by him at Muskoka that I do so, and offered the services of the Retail Credit Company for the use of the Commercial Finance Company. You would like me to go\u2014\nMr. HELLMUTH: Q. Yes, go on?\u2014A. I presented\u2014I first described our facilities to Mr. O\u2019Grady.\nQ. Will you say what you described?\u2014A. I described the fact that we have a forwarding office and representatives, forwarding office in Toronto and representatives in the cities throughout the country. I described to him the services rendered to finance companies, the auto purchase report, the dealer, the automobile dealer report, and the auto car check report, and described the blanks used in reference to each of these services. I quoted him the prices and told him the conditions under which the service was rendered; that is, that it is confidential, and that we would not be held liable for any damages accruing from the dissemination or publication of reports, nor were we responsible for any loss incident to the use of the reports. These conditions were all apparently satisfactory to Mr. O\u2019Grady, and I then presented him with the printed form that we use in that connection. He read it very carefully and signed it.\nQ. Now look at Exhibit 9 and tell me if that is the form?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Whose pencil writing is that\u2014\u201d10 King St. East, Toronto, Ont.\u201d?\u2014A. That is mine.\nQ. That is yours?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Then you say\u2014I don\u2019t want to lead, but it is apparent\u2014it was at this conversation with him, and offer whatever it was, that you made to him, at that time that this was signed, this Exhibit 9?\u2014A. Yes, as a condition of forwarding supplies for the use of the service.\nQ. Then is there anything else that you can recollect of that interview?\u2014A. Yes, there are two things. First, I took that indemnity agreement to our local office here and gave it to our manager as his authority to release reports to the Commercial Finance Corporation.\nQ. But can you tell me of anything else that took place while you were with Mr. O\u2019Grady.\u2014A. Yes. Mr. O\u2019Grady explained that he could begin using the auto purchase and the automobile dealer reports immediately, but that the car check reports were at that time being done by some other people that might make a point of retaining the work, and he was not in a position to press a change, but he wanted to be equipped so that in event of when that could be arranged that the complete service could be secured from the Retail Credit Company.\nQ. Does that cover as far as you can tell me what took place?\u2014A. Yes.\nWhen Mr. Hill returned to Atlanta, Georgia, where the head office of his company is situate, he wrote Mr. O\u2019Grady, on 4th August, 1925, the letter known as exhibit 10, of which these are the first two paragraphs:\nAt the request of our Toronto City Office, we are opening an account with your company and supplies have been forwarded to you, under separate cover, for requesting Auto Purchase and Dealer Car Check Reports. These carry your stenciled address and the number 3983, which has been assigned to the account.\nIn filling out the inquiry tickets, we would only stress that you please arrange to give us all the data of identification possible on each one. We should like to have them typewritten and to have both the business and residence addresses, as well as occupation, etc. This data aids us materially in giving quick and accurate service.\nThat the appellant fully realized its obligation with regard to the car-checking reports, and the nature of the service which they embraced, appears from exhibits 34 and 35\u2014instructions which it caused to be printed for the making of those reports. I quote the following clauses:\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR MAKING DEALER CAR\nCHECK REPORTS\n(Return blank if engaged in sale of automobiles)\nPurpose of the Report\nThe dealer has used finance facilities to purchase the cars listed. The finance company holds paper against each car, due when the dealer sells the car. The finance company wants us to check the possession and condition of the car. The dealer understands that these checks may be made at any time.\nCall on the dealer or his manager (not a clerk or mechanic) and ask him to show you the cars which are listed by serial number on the enclosed blank.\n1. Checking the Serial Number on the Car Itself: This number is usually found on the dash or under the hood. Unless you personally see the number on the cars, this report may misinform and mislead our customers instead of protecting them. (Do not let the dealer call the numbers to you either from the car or a book record altho you may be willing to accept his word or record.) This is not to be a statement but a personal check by you as our representative.\n2. Speedometer Reading: Note speedometer reading and enter this. If speedometer is not connected, so state in fourth column.\n3. Car Reported \u201cOut or on Demonstration\u201d: If there are cars listed and the dealers reports them out or on demonstration, you should answer \u201cNo\u201d in the third column and make a note in the sixth column of where cars are reported to be.\nDo not report any car present unless you actually see the listed serial number on the car.\nThe actual report of Mr. O\u2019Flynn, who was the appellant\u2019s examining agent or inspector at Belleville, made on 4th June, 1927, upon one of the printed forms provided for the purpose by the appellant (exhibit 27), and produced as a sample, bears the legend at the top:\nNOTE TO INSPECTOR\nPersonally examine the serial number and speedometer on each car, entering the information in the third and fourth columns and answer questions below.\nDo not make report from book record or any other information except by actually verifying the serial numbers on the machines.\nNow, the fact is that Mr. O\u2019Flynn, instead of taking care to execute his explicit instructions, so far neglected them as to permit Raynor\u2019s manager to prepare his reports; and while Mr. O\u2019Flynn saw the reports, signed them, and sent them in to his principal, he did not see or identify the cars, or their serial numbers, or their speedometer readings; and so cars were reported as on the dealer\u2019s premises which were not there; and the Finance Corporation was misled to its loss. It is compensation for this loss that the corporation now seeks to recover.\nThe appellant resists, denying that it had bound itself for more than reasonable care in the selection of its inspection agents; but that was clearly not the intention that animated the parties. There was no express stipulation as to agents or sub-agents; no obligation to employ either, except that, by necessity, the incorporated appellant could act only through its officers or agents; and it was, in my view, as much bound to the exercise of due care in the car\u2011checking as an individual contractor in the like case would have been. The appellant agreed to furnish information essential for the safety of the respondent\u2019s enterprise; in fact it did worse than to furnish none, for instead, it passed on, as its own, untrue and fraudulent statements prepared by the dealer\u2019s manager, in the similitude of truth, and calculated to defeat the very object for which the Finance Corporation had adopted and contracted to pay for the precaution of an exact and trustworthy check.\nBut Mr. Hellmuth argued very ingeniously that the appellant company, even if it would have been liable upon the facts, excluding the Indemnity Agreement (exhibit 9), is relieved, in express terms, by the concluding clause of that agreement; and it was upon that contention that the learned counsel placed the greater emphasis. The text of the document follows:\nINDEMNITY AGREEMENT\n.................................................. 19......\nTo\u2014RETAIL CREDIT COMPANY,\nAtlanta, Georgia.\nIt is agreed that the information furnished by you, in accordance with this agreement, shall be treated in confidence; that the undersigned will not disseminate or transmit the same directly or indirectly to the person reported on, or to any other person, unless he be in our employ in such capacity as to make it necessary that he know such information for our protection and benefit.\nThe undersigned agrees to hold the Retail Credit Company, and its employees, harmless on account of any damages which may arise from the publication or dissemination of information contrary to this understanding, or from the careless handling of any such reports.\nIn consideration of receiving this service, and as a condition of its rendition, the undersigned agrees that neither the Retail Credit Company, nor its employees, shall be responsible for any loss that may occur to the undersigned through the use of the information furnished.\n(Signed) COMMERCIAL FINANCE CORPORATION, Limited.\n(Per) W.O\u2019GRADY,\nManaging Director.\nNow, it must, of course, be remembered that the services which, by the oral agreement, the appellant agreed to render were not confined to reports respecting the locality and condition of cars. There were credit reports and personal or character reports which, naturally, would be of a highly confidential character, and as to which the reporting agency would be apt to stipulate for immunity from damages resulting from needless or unjustified publication or disclosure. Mr. Hill had described to Mr. O\u2019Grady these reports in his negotiations for the contract. I have already transcribed the passage where Mr. Hill said:\nI quoted him the prices and told him the conditions under which the service was rendered; that is, that it is confidential, and that we would not be held liable for any damages accruing from the dissemination or publication of reports, nor were we responsible for any loss incident to the use of the reports. These conditions were all apparently satisfactory to Mr. O\u2019Grady, and I then presented him with the printed form (Ex. 9) that we use in that connection. He read it very carefully and signed it.\nIt was considered by the trial Judge, or in the Appellate Division, that the Indemnity Agreement had reference only to reports of commercial credit, character and personal standing; it is suggested by the appellant\u2019s submissions, and it seems to be undisputed that the first two paragraphs relate only to reports of that nature. But it is contended that the remaining clause comprehends all services which the appellant company was to supply; and, as to the judgment of the Appellate Division which emphasizes the incredibility of the suggestion that the Finance Corporation would incur the trouble and expense of engaging the appellant\u2019s services for checking the dealer\u2019s cars upon terms of immunity to the appellant and its employees for their own fault in the operation; to this the learned counsel pertinently rejoins that it is not what the court would expect to discover in the attitude of the parties, but what, upon the true construction of their language, the parties actually contracted for, that must govern the decision; and he insists that the provision which the court thinks so unlikely is precisely embodied in the very agreement to which the parties have, in writing, deliberately committed themselves; and so the enquiry comes back to the meaning and application of the last paragraph.\nUpon this I have no doubt, after careful consideration, that the Indemnity Agreement, according to its strict and reasonable meaning, is alio intuitu to any question affecting the relations of the parties with respect to the ascertainment of the locality and condition of the cars which the dealer brought into his premises. What the Credit Company stipulated for in the last paragraph of the Indemnity Agreement was, expressly, in consideration of the service previously mentioned in the agreement; and that does not extend to the car-checking service. The expression, \u201cthis service,\u201d in the first line of the last clause, and the concluding words of the agreement\u2014\u201cthe information furnished,\u201d refer only to what is the subject-matter of the two preceding paragraphs, and the car-checking is foreign to that. It follows that the Indemnity Agreement does not improve the appellant\u2019s case.\nMr. McCarthy, representing the insurance companies, explains that his clients are content with the judgment as it stands, and they cross-appeal only in the event that it is reversed or varied.\nIn the result, the appeal should be dismissed; and the respondents should have their costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Smith, Rae & Greer.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Commercial Finance Corporation Ltd.: Briggs, Frost, Dillon & Birks.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Merchants Casualty Insurance Co.: Shaver, Paulin & Branscombe.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Western Assurance Co.: Hughes, Agar & Thompson.\n[1] (1930) 66 Ont.

The jury found that the defendant Wright\u2019s negligence was \u201cin cutting in on Winston\u2019s car without giving due notice to (sic.) such intention,\u201d and that the defendant Winston\u2019s (appellant\u2019s) negligence was \u201cin not having his car under proper control to meet an emergency.\u201d The appellant contended that there was no evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of negligence against him, and that it should have found that he was not guilty of any negligence causing the accident.\nOn the appeal to this Court, after hearing argument of counsel, the Court delivered judgment orally. Anglin C.J.C. would order a new trial; Rinfret and Smith JJ. would allow the appeal and dismiss the action as against appellant; Lamont and Cannon JJ. would dismiss the appeal. In the result, the judgment of the Court, delivered by the Chief Justice, was that the appeal be allowed and a new trial ordered, the costs of the abortive trial and of the appeals to the Appellate Division and to this Court to follow the event of the new trial. Anglin, C.J.C., stated that, in view of the divided opinion, and of the fact that he found, personally, that the trial already had was most unsatisfactory, he would order a new trial, agreeing with the two Judges who would allow the appeal, to the extent of setting aside the verdict, and with the two other Judges who would dismiss the appeal, to the extent of refusing to enter judgment for the defendant, contrary to the verdict of the jury, a power undoubtedly possessed by the Court, but very rarely to be exercised, and then only in the clearest cases.\nLamont J. (with whom Cannon J. concurred) stated that in his opinion there was no sound reason for interfering with the judgment as it stood; that the meaning of the jury\u2019s verdict was plain; they found an emergency due to cutting in, and found that the appellant was guilty of negligence in not having his car under control; from appellant\u2019s own evidence, he was driving at 18 to 20 miles an hour, and he had put his foot on the brake; the evidence was that the curb was five inches high, and that appellant not only jumped the curb and caught the plaintiff, but also that his car then ran 38 feet; on these facts it was open to the jury to say that the accident would not have occurred if he had had his car under control.\nSmith J. (with whom Rinfret J. concurred) stated his opinion that the jury had not made any finding on which the judgment against appellant could be sustained; the only negligence on his part that the jury was able to find\u2014and finally undertook to find\u2014was that he had not his car under control to meet an emergency; implying that he should have been prepared in advance to meet this emergency, which he could not foresee; that the jury did not make any finding that appellant was negligent in what he did after being placed by Wright in the emergency; that there is no obligation imposed by law on a driver to keep himself specially prepared for action in connection with some possible unforeseen emergency in which he may be placed; and there was no evidence, up to the time he was interfered with by the negligence of Wright, that appellant was not in full control of his car; that what the jury pretended to say was negligence does not in law constitute negligence. The learned judge agreed with the opinions expressed by Riddell and Fisher J.J.A. in the Appellate Division, and was of opinion that the action should be dismissed as against the appellant.\nAppeal allowed and new trial ordered.\nT.N. Phelan K.C. for the appellant.\nF.J. Hughes K.C. for the respondent.\n[1] (1931) 40 Ont. W.N. 313.\n"}

By a codicil the testator directed that his real property (of which his estate mostly consisted) should not be divided among the beneficiaries as directed by his will until after the lapse of 10 years from his death. The testator died in 1911. At the time of the present proceedings, begun in 1930, his widow (who had not remarried) and children still survived except a son S. who died in 1914, having attained the age of 30 years in the testator\u2019s life time. S. left a widow and children, one of whom, a posthumous child, died in infancy.\nHeld (1): The half portions which the sons were to receive at 30 years of age should be considered, not as loans, but as advances out of their shares of the residue (The holding to this effect in Re Singer, 33 Ont. L.R. 602, at 618; 52 Can. S.C.R. 447, adopted). (2): S\u2019s share in the residue of the estate became vested in interest at the testator\u2019s death (Busch v. Eastern Trust Co., [1928] Can. S.C.R. 479, distinguished). S., who was over 30 years of age, had then, subject to the effect of the codicil, an immediate right to payment of his half portion; and, while the codicil may have practically operated, owing to the nature of the assets, to postpone payment, it did not affect the vesting; nor was the right to the advance personal only to S. so as to be defeated by his death during the 10 year period. But S\u2019s. vested interest was subject to defeasance by an executory gift over (to his issue) in the event which happened (issue of S. surviving him); therefore his share was not transmitted by his will, and, the right now to the advance did not belong to S\u2019s. widow as his personal representative or as beneficiary under his will, but to his children (S\u2019s. widow inheriting her distributive share in the estate of S\u2019s. said deceased child).\nDuff J. dissented, holding that the direction for payment of half portions to the sons was strictly personal in relation to them in its incidence and effect, and that, with regard to S., no right now existed in any person to have the direction carried out.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of Logie J.[2]\nJacob Singer, late of Toronto, Ontario, deceased, by his last will and testament, dated May 16, 1904, gave all his property to his executrix and executors upon trusts, which included a direction to pay to his wife, Annie Singer, during her life or widowhood, the net annual income arising from his estate for the maintenance of herself and children, a direction for settlement upon his daughters on marriage, a direction \u201cto pay to each of my sons who shall reach the age of thirty years, a sum equal to half that portion of my estate, to which such son is entitled under this my will upon the death of his mother, such portion to be valued at the time of each son attaining his thirtieth year * * * Such payment to be considered as a loan from the estate.\u201d Upon the death or remarriage of his wife, the testator gave the residue of his estate to his children share and share alike, deducting from each share \u201cany sum or sums which shall already have been advanced to such child;\u201d with provision for division among surviving children of the share of any child who predeceased the widow without leaving issue, and for the issue of any child who predeceased the widow to take the share of their parent. By a codicil dated October 31, 1911, the testator directed that his real prop- erty (of which his estate mostly consisted) should not be divided among the beneficiaries as directed by his will until after the lapse of ten years from his death.\nThe material provisions of the will and codicil are more fully set out in the judgment of Newcombe J. now reported.\nThe will has previously been before the courts on certain questions[3].\nThe testator, Jacob Singer, died on November 13, 1911, leaving him surviving his widow (who has not remarried), three daughters and nine sons, all of whom survived at the time of the present proceedings except one son, Solomon, who died on October 19, 1914, being then upwards of 30 years of age (he had reached the age of 30 years in his father\u2019s lifetime), and leaving surviving him his wife (the appellant, Ella Tarshis) and two children (born March 22, 1911, and April 21, 1912, respectively) who are still living, and another, a posthumous child, who died in infancy. Solomon Singer left a will in which he appointed his said wife sole executrix and sole beneficiary.\nThe present proceedings were begun by originating notice of motion, on behalf of the present appellants (the said surviving children of Solomon Singer, deceased, and the said Ella Tarshis) for determination as to what rights or interests the present appellants or any of them have under the provisions of the will of Jacob Singer, deceased, and in particular whether the trustees of the will should be directed to pay now to the children of Solomon Singer, deceased, along with the mother of his said deceased minor child as one of the heirs of such child, as they may be interested, or to the personal representative of Solomon Singer, deceased, before the death or remarriage of the testator\u2019s (Jacob Singer\u2019s) widow, a sum equal to half that portion of the estate to which Solomon Singer would have been entitled under the will upon the death of his mother had he not predeceased her.\nLogie J.[4] held that, upon the true construction of the will and codicil, neither the children of Solomon Singer, deceased, nor his personal representative, were entitled to receive any of the moneys which might have been payable as advances or loans to Solomon Singer had he survived the testator ten years. An appeal to the Appellate Division was dismissed[5], and an appeal was brought to this Court.\nW.F. O\u2019Connor K.C. for the appellants.\nR.S. Cassels K.C. and D. Guthrie for the respondent Annie Singer.\nMcGregor Young K.C., Official Guardian, who, at the hearing before Logie J., was appointed \u201cto represent all persons contingently entitled to interests in the estate.\u201d\nE.F. Singer K.C. for the executors of the will of Jacob Singer, deceased.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court (Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ.) was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014It becomes necessary for the Court further to interpret the will and codicil of the late Jacob Singer, of Toronto, who died 13th November, 1911. Some questions have already been determined, both at Toronto and in this Court, upon the same testamentary documents, In re Singer[6].\nThe will was executed 16th May, 1904, and the codicil 31st October, 1911. The testator left considerable property, consisting mostly of real estate in small lots at Toronto; he left surviving him his widow, three daughters and nine sons. The daughters and eight of the nine sons still survive, but the other son, Solomon, died 19th October, 1914, leaving a will whereby he constituted his wife, the appellant, Ella Tarshis, sole executrix; and the question involved in this submission is as to whether his surviving children and their mother, in right of her kindship to a deceased child, are entitled to share in the present distribution of that portion of the residue of Jacob Singer\u2019s estate which Solomon would have received if he had lived.\nJacob Singer, by the first clause of his will, provided as follows:\nI give, devise and bequest unto my executrix and executors hereinafter named all my property, both real and personal and wheresoever situated upon the following trusts, that is to say:\nIn the next four clauses there are some charitable or benevolent dispositions; and then there are some provisions with regard to the carrying on of the testator\u2019s business; and the clauses material to the present question follow. In the words of the will they are:\nAnd I direct my said trustees to pay to my wife Annie Singer, during the term of her natural life and as long as she will remain my widow the net annual income arising from my estate for the maintenance of herself and our children; should however my said wife remarry, then such annuity shall cease.\nI hereby appoint my said wife Annie Singer to be the sole guardian of my children during their minority, but in case of my said wife shall remarry, then I appoint my Son in law Geo. I. Miller of New York to act with her as guardians of my children and I direct my said trustees to pay to such guardians for the support, maintenance, and education of my said children, whatever summ shall in their opinion be necessary for their proper support, maintenance and education; such sum however, not to exceed thirty dollars per month for each child.\nI direct my said trustees to secure and settle upon each of my daughters at the time any such daughter shall marry with their mothers consent, such consent to be signified to the said trustees in writing, the sum of six thousand dollars, as her separate estate free from the control of any husband, and to give to each such daughter so marrying as aforesaid the sum of one thousand dollars for the purpose of her wedding outfitt.\nI direct my said trustees to pay to each of my sons who shall reach the age of thirty years, a sum equal to half that portion of my estate, to which such son is entitled under this my will upon the death of his mother, such portion to be valued at the time of each son attaining his thirtieth year, the valuation to be made by my executors and trustees, and shall be final. Such payment to be considered as a loan from the estate.\nUpon the death or re-marriage of my said wife I give, devise and bequeath all the rest and residue of my estate, not hereinbefore specifically disposed of to my said children share and share alike and I direct my said trustees to pay to each of my said children upon his or her attaining the age of twenty-one years his or her share of my estate, deducting however therefrom any sum or sums which shall allready have been advanced to such child; and in the event of any of my said children predeceasing my said wife without leaving lawfull issue him, her, or them surviving, then his, her or their share or shares shall be devided equaly between my surviving children, who shall attain their age of twenty-one years; but in the event of my said children, who shall so predecease my said wife, leaving him, her, or them surviving lawfull issue, then I direct, that such issue shall stand in the place of and be entitled to the share of the parent so deceased.\nBy the codicil there are some additional gifts; and by clauses 10 and 14 the testator provided thus:\n10. I hereby further direct that my real property shall not be divided among the beneficiaries as directed by my will until after the lapse of ten years from my death and I further direct that the business of managing my real estate shall be carried on by my sons as it has been carried on heretofore, and I direct that my sons shall receive such salaries as shall seem just in the discretion of my executors, in remuneration for their services. 14. I further direct that anything mentioned in the aforesaid will, which is at variance with the provisions mentioned in this codicil, shall be subservient and subject to this codicil.\nThe particular question upon which the appellants seek to be advised, as stated in the originating notice of motion, is\nIn particular whether the trustees of the said last will of the testator should be directed to pay now to (1) the children of Solomon Singer, deceased (son of the testator) along with the mother of a deceased minor child of said Solomon Singer, deceased, as one of the heirs of such child, as they may be interested, or (2) to the said personal representative of said Solomon Singer, deceased, before the death or remarriage of the testator\u2019s widow, a sum equal to half that portion of the estate of the testator to which the said Solomon Singer, deceased, would have been entitled under the said last will of the testator upon the death of his mother had he not predeceased her.\nThe case was heard by Logie J., of the Supreme Court of Ontario, who held that neither the personal representative of Solomon Singer nor his children were entitled to share in the payment directed by the clause of the will which provides for an advance to be paid to each of the testator\u2019s sons who should reach the age of thirty years.\nThere was an appeal to the Appellate Division and the appeal was dismissed, either upon the ground that the interest of Solomon Singer was not vested, or because the provision for an advance to him upon his attaining thirty years of age lapsed at his death. It may, however, conveniently be said here that Solomon Singer was, at his death, upwards of thirty years of age. There are thus two questions to be determined; first, as to whether Solomon, at the time of his death, had a vested interest; and, secondly, whether his interest, if vested, inured only to his personal use and benefit and was not transmissible.\nBoth the learned Judge of first instance and the Justices of Appeal refer to Busch v. Eastern Trust Co.[7], but it does not, in my opinion, rule this case. There was a question of vesting, it is true; but the facts were materially different. In every case it is the testator\u2019s intention, if it can be gathered from the will, which must govern; and, while there are some rules to which resort may be had for ambiguous or doubtful cases, there is none which is allowed to prevail in competition with lawful intention clearly ascertainable upon the face of the instrument. In the Busch case7 there was a direction to divide and pay the residue at a future time; and that was the only evidence of the gift, except a reference to the legatees, as those who would then be entitled; and the court followed the course of authority in holding that the vesting was postponed until the time of distribution. Here, however, the interpretation leads plainly to the opposite result. The entire estate is given at the testator\u2019s death to his executors, upon the trusts defined by the will. The income of the residue is to be paid to the testator\u2019s widow during her life, or so long as she remains his widow, \u201cfor the maintenance of herself and our children.\u201d The question is concerned with a gift of a portion of the residue, and the residuary clause is immediately preceded and interpreted by what I shall call the \u201cthirty years clause\u201d; I have already quoted the words, and I think they unmistakably determine the testator\u2019s meaning. Solomon Singer lived for more than thirty years. We are told that he had reached the age of thirty years in his father\u2019s lifetime, and, consequently, when the testator died, Solomon had, subject to the effect of the codicil which I shall presently consider, an immediate right to receive payment from the trustees of a sum equal to one-half of his share or portion of the estate, at a valuation, and his share is identified by the testator as \u201cthat portion of my estate to which such son is entitled under my will upon the death of his mother\u201d; half of that was, therefore, payable at the testator\u2019s death. And, as I understand the judgment of the learned judge who heard the motion, he does not question that interpretation. He holds the appellants disentitled by the codicil. The learned Judges of Appeal reach the same result, though for various reasons.\nIt is clearly expressed in the residuary clause that, in the event of any of the testator\u2019s children dying before his widow, without issue surviving, \u201cthen his or her share or shares shall be divided equally between my surviving children who shall attain the age of twenty-one years; but in the event of my said children who shall predecease my said wife leaving him, her or them surviving lawful issue, then I direct that such issue shall stand in the place of and be entitled to the share of the parent so deceased.\u201d\nA doubt is suggested as to the meaning of the concluding words of the thirty years clause, \u201csuch payment to be considered as a loan from the estate.\u201d That question was considered along with some others in the former litigation; and, in the judgment of Meredith C.J.O., in the Court of Appeal[8], in which the majority of the learned Justices of Appeal concurred, he held that\nThe direction that what they receive is to be considered as a loan from the estate, coupled with the provision for the deduction, upon the ultimate distribution of the estate, from the share of any child to whom advances shall have been made, of the amount of the advances, was intended to make it clear that a son who received any money under the direction as to payments to sons who attain the age of thirty years, should not, in addition, receive a full share of the residue to be divided, when the division came to be made.\nIt appears that the majority of the learned Judges in this Court agreed with the view so expressed. Singer v. Singer[9]. It is difficult to suppose that the testator meant to require his sons, at the age of thirty years, to borrow from his estate, or that repayment should be enforced, except by way of set off; and I am willing to adopt the view expressed by Meredith, C.J.O., if not bound by it by reason of its acceptance by the majority of this Court upon the former appeal. The half portions which the sons were to receive at thirty years of age are, therefore, to be considered as advances out of their shares of the residue.\nThe codicil remains to be considered; and, by the 14th clause, it is to control the provisions of the will where there is any variance; but, for the purposes of this case, there is no conflict between the will and the codicil apparent upon these documents themselves. It is suggested that, inasmuch as the testator\u2019s estate consisted mostly of realty, upon some of which it would be necessary to realize in order completely to satisfy the thirty years clause of the will, the 10th clause of the codicil, having regard to the nature of the assets at the testator\u2019s death, indirectly operated to defer advances to any of the sons for the period of ten years. But while that clause may have practically operated to postpone payments, both under the thirty years clause and under the residuary clause, it does not, I think, affect the vesting. And the question which now arises, more than ten years after the testator\u2019s death, as to the rights of Solomon\u2019s widow and children, should, I think, be determined by the interpretation of the will itself, as if there had been no codicil. Masten and Orde, JJ.A., consider that the provision made for the testator\u2019s sons under the thirty years clause \u201cwas personal to the son and lapsed if at the time when such advance became payable the son was no longer living\u201d; but, with all due respect, neither of the testamentary documents says so, nor can I discover any evidence of such an intention.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal, with costs throughout to all parties, to be paid out of the estate. If, in these circumstances, there be any question whether the declaration should be in favour of Mrs. Tarshis, as the personal representative of Solomon Singer, or as guardian of her surviving children, and as representing an interest in the estate of her deceased child, it may be spoken to.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014The conditions themselves of the direction shew, in my view, quite unmistakeably, that the direction is strictly personal in relation to the sons in its incidence and effect. This is of the essence of the testamentary provision; and it is entirely incompatible with the supposition that any right is created to have the direction carried out that is transmissible by operation of law to the legal personal representative.\nThese considerations are also sufficient to negative the devolution of any such right upon the children under the terms of the will.\nThe appeal should be dismissed; the costs of all parties to be paid out of the estate.\nA further hearing was held upon the question left open in the last paragraph of the judgment of Newcombe J., and pursuant to leave reserved therein, and for settlement of the terms of the formal judgment.\nD. Guthrie for the respondent Annie Singer.\nMcGregor Young K.C., Official Guardian, for infants.\nW.F. O\u2019Connor K.C. (F.D. Hogg K.C. with him) for the appellant Ella Tarshis. The judgment of the court on these questions was delivered by\nNEWCOMBE J.\u2014At the opening of the present session of Court, the parties were heard further, pursuant to the leave reserved by the judgment pronounced on 11th May last.\nUpon the question as to whether Solomon\u2019s share was transmitted by his will, my answer is in the negative. It is provided in terms by the antepenultimate clause of the will of Jacob, his father, that\nin the event of my said children, who shall so predecease my said wife, leaving him, her, or them surviving lawful issue, then I direct, that such issue shall stand in the place of and be entitled to the share of the parent so deceased.\nJacob\u2019s widow is living and has not remarried; and, therefore, the time for distribution of the residue of his estate has not arrived; and, in any event, it would conflict with the natural meaning of the clause which I have quoted to recognize the suggestion, submitted on behalf of Solomon\u2019s widow, that she is entitled to the exclusion of the issue. And so, notwithstanding that Solomon acquired a vested interest at the testator\u2019s death, it was, upon my interpretation of the will, subject to defeasance by an executory gift over in the event which happened. This follows from the decisions of the House of Lords, in O\u2019Mahoney v. Burdett[10], and Ingram and McQueen v. Soutien[11]; and the judgment of Lord Shaw of Dunfermline, in the Privy Council, in Ward v. Brown[12].\nThere was, however, a posthumous son of Solomon, Eric, who died in his first year; and it is not disputed that Eric\u2019s mother inherits, to the extent of her share in his estate, under the Ontario statute of distributions.\nThe appellants now wish to recover interest, although interest was not claimed by the originating notice; but in my view that claim is not open upon this appeal. It may, however, without prejudice from the present application, be raised upon the accounting, or other proper proceedings, disclosing the facts, if the parties be so advised. They will, of course, not overlook that Meredith, C.J.O., in the former case[13], referring to the paragraph of his judgment already quoted, added that This consideration, and the absence of anything being said as to the loan bearing interest, or of an addition of interest to the sum to be deducted from the share, lead me to the conclusion that interest is not payable on the sum which a son may receive, and that he cannot be required, as a condition of making a payment to him, to give security\u201d for it.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Louis M.

Powell K.C., for the motion.\nW. L. Scott K.C., and A. J. Fraser, contra. Rinfret, J.\u2014The appellant moves for an order striking out paragraph no. 11 of the factum filed on behalf of the respondent, the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway Company, and paragraph no. 12 of the factum filed on behalf of the respondent, the city of Hamilton, in this appeal, upon the ground that the said paragraphs are improper, vexatious and embarrassing. The motion was heard by the registrar, who, being of opinion that this was a \u201cmatter * * * proper for the decision of a judge\u201d, under rule 83, referred the same to me as rota judge.\nAfter having heard counsel for the parties, I am of opinion that the motion should be dismissed with costs.\nThe appeal is taken from a decision of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada pursuant to the provisions of the Railway Act. It is submitted upon a case settled by the Board. The statement of facts so settled contains the following paragraph:\n2. Acting in pursuance of the powers conferred upon it in that behalf by its special Acts of incorporation, referred to in paragraph no. 1 hereof, and with the legal consent of the city of Hamilton, the appellant, the Bell Telephone Company of Canada, lawfully constructed its lines of telephone and plant over, along the sides of, upon, under and within the limits of the following streets, highways and public places within the limits of the city of Hamilton, namely: Charles street, McNab street, James street, Hughson street, Catherine street, Aurora street, Victoria avenue, Wood Market square and Baillie street.\nThe factums of each of the respondents set up the following allegation:\nThe appellant has not obtained authority to carry its lines, wires and conductors over or beneath the railway of the railway company as required by section 372 of the Railway Act, which said section reads as follows:\nIt is contended on behalf of the appellant that there is nothing in the statement of facts as settled and printed to support such an allegation in the respective factums of the respondents and that the appellant will accordingly be placed at an unfair disadvantage if this appeal is to be proceeded with upon the respondents\u2019 factums as they now stand.\nThere are rules concerning the forms of the printed case (Rules nos. 6, 7, 11 & 12) and they provide that the registrar shall not file the case without the leave of the court, or a judge, if these rules have not been complied with (rule 13). There are also rules concerning the contents of the factums and the form and manner in which they shall be printed. The registrar is not to receive them unless the requirements of these rules have been followed. But I cannot find any power vested in the registrar, or in a judge in chambers, to deal with the allegations of fact, or the arguments of law, which counsel deem it advisable to make in their factums. The factum is nothing more than a written argument. It sets out the \u201cpoints for argument in appeal\u201d. It is not within the province of the registrar, or a judge in chambers, to control the manner and form in which these points for argument are to be presented.\nThe paragraph complained of in the respondents\u2019 factums is in the nature of an argument. It does not and cannot modify the statement of facts settled by the Board of Railway Commissioners. It will have to be appreciated and weighed by the court in the light of that statement of facts. The situation is vastly different from that where a party includes in his factum\nevidence which formed no part of the case in the court below and forms no part of the case settled for appeal here,\nand the decision of Idington J. in Bing Kee v. Yick Chong (April, 1910, Cameron\u2019s Supreme Court Practice, 3rd ed., p. 405) can afford no precedent for the present application.\nThe appellant will not be prejudiced by my decision, for, if it should be found advisable, the matter can be dealt with by the full court when the appeal comes on for hearing (Vernon v. Oliver[1]; Coleman v. Miller, Cassels\u2019 Digest, 2nd ed., p. 683; Wallace v. Souther, Coutl\u00e9e\u2019s Digest, p. 1102; F airman v. City of Montreal, Coutl\u00e9e\u2019s Digest, p. 1105). In the reference re Waters & Water Powers[2] documents printed in the case were ordered struck out upon verbal application at the hearing.\nAs already stated, the motion will accordingly be dismissed with costs, including those already reserved by the registrar.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n[1] (1884) 11 S.C.R. 156.\n[2] [1929] S.C.R. 200.\n"}

Ross (Insolvent).\n1931: May 13, 15; 1931: October 6.\nPresent: Anglin \u0421 J.C. and Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nPromissory note\u2014Agreement to subscribe for a university fund\u2014Validity\u2014Valuable consideration\u2014Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 16, ss. 10 and 53.\nIn March, 1914, R. offered to give to McGill University, namely the respondent, $150,000 for the erection and equipment of a gymnasium and the offer was accepted; but the building was deferred owing to the war. In 1920, the university authorities undertook a campaign for a \u201cCentennial Endowment Fund\u201d and R., by the terms of a \u201cSubscription and Pledge Card,\u201d then promised to contribute $200,000 to that fund on the condition that the previous offer of $150,000 would be included in the subsequent offer, the university being at the same time released from the obligation of erecting the gymnasium. R. paid $100,000 up to 1924, when he asked for an extension of time for payment of the balance. The respondent acceded to R\u2019s request and agreed to accept a promissory note for $100,000 dated December 1, 1925, and payable three years after date. R. became insolvent and the trustee in bankruptcy disallowed the respondent\u2019s claim for the amount of the note and the interest accrued. The Superior Court reversed that decision, which judgment was affirmed by the appellate court.\nHeld that R\u2019s offers to suscribe for the erection of the gymnasium and later for the Endowment Fund, upon the terms agreed, involved him in liability for the stipulated payments, according to the law of Quebec where the contract was entered into, and also, per Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ., according to the common law of England.\nHeld, also, that the forbearance or extension of time limited for the balance of those payments which R. subsequently obtained by the giving of the note was valuable consideration within the meaning of the common law of England or under s. 53 of the Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 16.\nJudgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench (Q.R. 50 K.B. 107) aff. APPEAL from the decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Panneton J.[2], and allowing the respondent\u2019s claim for $118,862.19 to be collected as valid according to its rank.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nJ. W. Cook K.C.,and G. G. Hyde K.C., for the appellant.\nJ. A. Ewing K.C., and G. L. McFadden K.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Anglin C.J.C. and Rinfret and Cannon JJ.[3] was delivered by\nAnglin, C.J.C.\u2014I concur in the disposition of this case suggested by my brother Newcombe and, speaking generally, in his reasons therefor.\nAssuming that Mr. J. K. L. Ross incurred a legal obligation to pay to McGill University $200,000 towards its endowment fund, the proposition seems to me so clear that it can require no citation of authority to support it, that, whether the matter be dealt with under the law of England, or under R.S.C. 1927, \u0441. 16, s. 53, the extension of time for payment of the $200,000, was a \u201cvaluable\u201d consideration for the giving by Mr. Ross of the note in question.\nThe only question, therefore, requiring further discussion here seems to be whether or not Ross did incur a legally enforceable obligation to pay $200,000 towards the endowment fund of the university. That question, it seems to me, must be determined according to the law of the province of Quebec, where the contract to pay was entered into, and was intended to be carried out, and, if need be, enforced. According to that law there can be no question that there had been a real and lawful \u201ccause\u201d (Arts. 982, 984, 1131, C.C.) for Mr. Ross\u2019s promise to pay $150,000, to be used towards the cost of the erection of a gymnasium, to be known as the Ross Memorial Gymnasium. It follows that the release of that obligation afforded a like lawful \u201ccause\u201d for the promise to pay the $200,000.\nThis appeal, accordingly fails, the only grounds of appeal argued by the appellant having been that there was no \u201cvaluable\u201d consideration for the giving of the note and an utter lack of consideration for the promise to pay the $200,000.\nThe judgment of Newcombe, Rinfret, Lamont and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nNewcombe J.\u2014It is admitted, for the purposes of the case, that the respondent institution, which is the petitioner, and McGill University are, in the words of the admission, \u201cone and the same\u201d. The claim, filed 14th November, 1928, is against the bankrupt estate of John Kenneth Leveson Ross, upon a promissory note, dated 1st December, 1925, made by Mr. Ross, whereby the maker promised to pay to the order of the petitioner, three years after date, $100,000 at Montreal, value received, with interest at six per cent, per annum, semi-annually. The amount, as valued at the date of the claim, for principal and interest, was $118,862.19. The trustee, by notice in writing of 22nd March, 1929, notified the respondent that he had disallowed the claim, upon the ground, as expressed, that \u201cthe promissory note upon which your claim is made was given without consideration\u201d.\nUpon appeal, Panneton J., of the Superior Court of the province of Quebec, sitting in bankruptcy, tried the case upon pleadings and evidence, reversed the decision of the trustee and ordered him\nto admit the petitioner\u2019s claim as valid and to collocate it according to his rank.\nThe trustee appealed to the Court of King\u2019s Bench, where the appeal was heard by five judges, and the court, with one dissent, affirmed the judgment.\nUpon appeal to this court, the trustee\u2019s contention is\nthat he was justified in rejecting the claim owing to absence of consideration, the note in question being a mere gift covering the balance of the subscription by Mr. Ross to the Centennial Endowment Fund for McGill University.\nIt is necessary to consider the facts; and they are not in dispute. There are the admissions and correspondence of the parties; and it is, perhaps, not immaterial to observe at the outset that \u201cvalue received\u201d is acknowledged upon the face of the note; and, moreover, there is the presumption of consideration until the contrary is shewn. Mr. Ross does not appear ever to have questioned his liability, and the respondent of course insists upon its claim.\nThe circumstances leading up to the making of the note are disclosed by the admissions signed by the solicitors; but the letters which passed between the parties were also produced as exhibits at the trial. By the first of these letters, dated 26th March, 1914, Mr. Ross, writing to Mr. Vaughan, the secretary of the university, says\nFollowing out the verbal promise I recently made Principal Peterson, I now confirm to you the offer I then made to him that I would give to McGill University a sum of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the erection and equipment of a gymnasium to be known as the Ross Memorial Gymnasium, on condition that the University apply a further sum of one hundred thousand dollars (being the amount of my late father\u2019s legacy to the University) for the completion of such gymnasium.\nAs an additional safeguard in case of my decease before this undertaking is implemented, I have caused to be added a clause in a codicil to my will in terms of the enclosed copy.\nThe narrative of the first two enumerated paragraphs of the admissions is that\n1. By the terms of a letter of date March 26, 1914, addressed by Mr. J. K. L. Ross, the bankrupt, to the secretary of McGill University, (The Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning) the former agreed to give to McGill University the sum of $150,000 for the erection and equipment of a gymnasium to be known as The Ross Memorial Gymnasium on the condition that the University apply a further sum of $100,000 (being the amount of a legacy left by the father of the bankrupt) for the completion of such gymnasium.\n2. By the terms of a letter of date March 28, 1914, addressed to Mr. J. K. L. Ross, the bankrupt, by the secretary of McGill University, the letter and offer of the 26th of March, 1914, were duly acknowledged and accepted.\nThese two paragraphs are apt to describe an arrangement whereby Mr. Ross and the university intended to be bound; it is in terms an accepted offer, and it is not denied that he incurred an obligation to pay $150,000 upon performance by the university of the stipulated conditions. It is suggested that the university had not earned the right to payment, because, as we are told, the building of the gymnasium was deferred owing to the war; but it is evident that neither of the parties considered the project to have been frustrated or abandoned; and, when, on 1st August, 1920, after the Peace, Sir Arthur Currie succeeded Dr. Peterson as principal of the university, and the governors, later in the year, under- took the campaign for their Centennial Endowment Fund, which, in the result, produced upwards of $6,000,000, Mr. Ross, being a wealthy graduate and one of the governors, naturally had occasion to consider the amount and terms of a contribution to that fund. He appears then to have realized that his conditional promise for the gymnasium was still outstanding and to have desired that the amount of $150,000, so promised for that special object, should be released for the general purposes of the Endowment Fund, and, for this, he sought and obtained terms from the university, as stated by the third and fourth admissions.\n3. By the terms of a Subscription and Pledge Card of date November 26, 1920, and an explanatory letter bearing the same date and attached to the same, Mr. J. K. L. Ross, the bankrupt, bound himself to contribute the sum of $200,000 towards the McGill Centennial Endowment Fund on the condition that the amount of $150,000 which the said Mr. J. K. L. Ross had agreed to pay towards a gymnasium for McGill University by the terms of his letter of the 26th of March, 1914, should be included in the said amount of $200,000, in consideration of which the said Mr. J. K. L. Ross withdrew the restriction on the destination of the said amount of $150,000, and on the condition also that an amount of $20,000 which had been promised by the said Mr. J. K. L. Ross to McGill University on a previous occasion should, if still remaining unpaid, be included in the said amount of $200,000; said amount of $200,000 was made payable in five equal consecutive yearly instalments, the first of which was to become due on the first day of January, 1922.\nAs regards the amount of $20,000 referred to by the bankrupt, as having been promised on a previous occasion, there was never any previous written agreement or subscription to pay an, amount of that size.\n4. By letter of date November 30, 1920, Mr. J. W. Ross, the honorary treasurer of McGill University, acknowledged and accepted the said subscription of $200,000 on behalf of McGill University and promised that the letter of Mr. J. K. L. Ross of the 26th of November, 1920, setting forth the conditions above referred to, would be kept attached to the subscription card in order that the wishes of Mr. J. K. L. Ross might be properly carried out.\nMr. Ross paid, on account of this consolidated subscription, the stipulated instalments of $40,000 in 1922 and in 1923, and $20,000 in 1924; or $100,000 in all. There have been no subsequent payments. It is shewn that unfortunately, even in 1924, liquid resources were becoming difficult and that Mr. Ross was seeking indulgence in the way of an extension of time for payment of the balance; and, at the end of the next succeeding year, the agreement evidenced by the following paragraphs of the admissions was concluded. 10. By the terms of a letter of date November 19, 1925, written by Mr. J. K. L. Ross to Mr. John W. Ross, the honorary treasurer of McGill University, the former called attention to the balance of $100,000 then remaining due on his original subscription of $200,000 and requested the privilege of paying by giving his promissory note for the said amount of $100,000 for three years with interest at 6 per centum per annum.\n11. By the terms of a letter of date December 3, 1925, written by Mr. A. P. S. Glass\u00e7o, the secretary and bursar of McGill University, Mr. J. K. L. Ross was notified that his request for a further extension, of time, as mentioned in his letter of the 19th of November, 1925, had been submitted to the Finance Committee of the Governors of the University and had been acceded to by them, the understanding being that Mr. J. K. L. Ross was to pay interest on the note semi-annually at the said rate of 6 per centum per annum.\n12. In accordance with the said letters, a promissory note for $100,000, dated December 1, 1925, payable to the order of the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning, with interest at 6 per centum per annum, payable semi-annually, was duly signed and executed by the said Mr. J. K. L. Ross and delivered to the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning.\n13. It is the said promissory note of $100,000, dated December 1, 1925, and payable three years after its date which is referred to in the proof of debt filed with the trustee on or about the 14th of November, 1928, by the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning, and the amount claimed to be due on the same at that time was $118,862.19, as appears from the said proof of debt.\nWhen the note was made nobody doubted Mr. Ross\u2019s ability or willingness to fulfil his promise; he sought the forbearance for his own convenience, and because he did not care at that time \u201cto disturb any investment\u201d. The stipulation for interest was introduced at the suggestion of the university. It is not contended hat his liability is affected by any provision of the Bankruptcy Act impressing the transaction with invalidity; nor is it suggested that Mr. Ross was acting under any mistake, or that he did not intend the note to have the effect of an enforceable instrument.\nThe appellant quotes sections 10 and 53 of the Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1927, \u0441. 16, by which it is enacted that\n10. The rules of the common law of England, including the law merchant, save in so far as they are inconsistent with the express provisions of this Act, shall apply to bills of exchange, promissory notes and cheques.\nConsideration\n53. Valuable consideration for a bill may be constituted by\n(a) any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract;\n(b) an antecedent debt or liability.\n2. Such debt or liability is deemed valuable consideration whether the bill is payable on demand or at a future time. And he urges, by his factum, \u201cthat the matter is one governed by the common law of England, and that, under that law, Ross\u2019s agreement is a nullity\u201d. He adds that, \u201cunder the law of Quebec the agreement is equally void\u201d. But I think he fails to shew that the agreement is void under either system, for in my opinion, the presumption is not overcome, and moreover the evidence affords proof of valuable consideration for the making of the note, and is incompatible with any other conclusion.\nThe appellant in his factum states his case very frankly, and it is worth while to quote these passages.\nIt appears that the late Mr. James Ross, the father of Mr. J. K. L. Ross, died in the year 1913 and by his will bequeathed the sum of $100,000 to McGill. In the year 1914 Mr. J. K. L. Ross wrote the University authorities agreeing to contribute the sum of $150,000 towards the building of a gymnasium. This offer was subject to the following conditions:\n(1) That the gymnasium should be built by the University. (2) That it should be called \u201cThe Ross Memorial Gymnasium.\u201d (3) That the sum of $100,000 left by the late Mr. James Ross would be used to partially defray its cost. The gymnasium was never built, and when the campaign for the Centennial Endowment Fund was inaugurated, in the year 1920, it was stipulated as a condition of the subscription of Mr. J. K. L. Ross that any understanding between himself and the University authorities in regard to the gymnasium would be considered as at an end. Accordingly, when Mr. J. K. L. Ross agreed to contribute $200,000 to the Centennial Endowment Fund, as evidenced by his pledge card and letter, the understanding in regard to the building of a gymnasium was completely ended. Mr. Ross was released from his obligation, such as it was, and on the other hand, the McGill authorities were released from their obligation to build a gymnasium, to expend on it the $100,000 which they had received from the late Mr. James Ross and to name it \u201cThe Ross Memorial Gymnasium.\u201d Sir Arthur Currie fully understands this and explains it as follows:\u2014\nQ. Will you tell me what consideration Mr. Ross received from the University of McGill for the signing of that pledge card?\u2014A. The release of an obligation to pay $150,000, which was to be devoted to the building of a gymnasium. The release of any obligation to pay $20,000, which was in dispute\u2014not in dispute, but somebody seemed to have forgotten just what it was about.\nQ. You speak of the release of the subscription for the building of the gymnasium of $150,000; the consideration of that subscription was the building of a gymnasium, $150,000?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. And the gymnasium has never been built up to the present time, is that correct?\u2014A. Yes, that is correct.\nQ. So consequently the first subscription must be left out of the question altogether, because the building of a gymnasium which was the consideration for that subscription, has not been proceeded with?\u2014A. The subscription had never been received; the amount was subscribed in 1914 and never paid. Q. The release was a release to the McGill University of this obligation to build this gymnasium?\u2014A. Yes, and we rehe ved Mr. Ross of the obligation to pay $150,000, which he had promised.\nQ. And he on the other hand relieved you from the obligation of building the gymnasium?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. It was a mutual discharge and release, as regards the $150,000?\u2014A. Yes.\nMr. Justice Panneton disposes of this evidence by stating that, in his view, Sir Arthur Currie is evidently mistaken since at no time was the University under an obligation to build a gymnasium, but Ross was under the obligation to pay if they built it. \u201cThere was, therefore, no mutual discharge or release as regards the $150,000.\u201d\nThis is obviously incorrect. The University was formally released from the obligation of erecting the building, of contributing the $100,000 received from the late Mr. James Ross and of naming it \u201cThe Ross Memorial Gymnasium.\u201d Mr. J. K. L. Ross, on the other hand, was released from the obligation of contributing the $150,000. There was, as Sir Arthur Currie truly stated, a mutual release and discharge.\nNow if, as the appellant contends, the matter is governed by the common law of England, the mutual release and discharge upon which he relies really satisfies the requirement of valuable consideration. Obviously, when Mr. Ross\u2019s offer of 1914 was accepted, it became a promise; and it is unnecessary to consider whether or not he had power to revoke that promise; he never did revoke it or manifest any intention to exercise any power of revocation, if any, which he may have had. Sir Frederick Pollock in the 9th edition of his Principles of Contract, at p. 195, says that\nIn many cases a promisor has the option of avoiding his contract for some cause existing at the date of the promise. But in all such cases the contract is valid until rescinded, and the right to rescind it may be lost by events beyond the promisors control; so there is no difficulty in treating his promise as a good consideration.\nAnd when, in 1920, Mr. Ross arranged with the university authorities the terms of his present subscription, it was one of his stipulations, and a term of the bargain upon which he insisted, that the amount promised for the gymnasium should, with the consent of the university, be diverted from that object and figure in the Endowment Fund. It was upon that footing that he consented to subscribe, and the substitution of the new agreement must be regarded as consideration of value to both parties. Mr. Ross says in terms of his letter to the treasurer of the university of 26th November, 1920, that\nThe special conditions I asked for with regard to my contribution (meaning his contribution to the Endowment .Fund) were (1) that an amount of $150,000 which I had previously promised towards a gymnasium for McGill should be included in my present contribution, in consideration of which I should withdraw the restriction on the destination of that amount.\nIf, therefore, as I think, Mr. Ross\u2019s subscription to the Endowment Fund upon the terms agreed involved him in liability for the stipulated payments, the forbearance or extension of time limited for the balance of those payments which he subsequently obtained by the giving of the note: was valuable consideration within the meaning of the law. This, I think, is established beyond doubt by the English authorities, and I shall refer to some of them.\nSir Frederick Pollock, in the book cited, at pp. 186, 187, quotes as an elementary principle that the law will not enter into an enquiry as to the adequacy of the consideration.\nThe idea is characteristic (he says) not only in English positive law but in the English school of theoretical jurisprudence and politics. Hobbes says: \u201cThe value of all things contracted for is measured by the appetite of the contractors, and therefore the just value is that which they be contented to give.\u201d And the legal rule is of long standing, and illustrated by many cases. \u201cWhen a thing is to be done by the plaintiff, be it ever so small, this is a sufficient consideration to ground an action.\u201d\nThe footnote refers to Sturlyn v. Albany[4], and marginal references there.\nProfessor Story in his book on Bills of Exchange, 4th ed., c. vi, s. 183, puts the following question:\nWhat then is a valuable consideration in the sense of the law?\nAnd he answers, quoting Comyn\u2019s Digest, Action of Assumpsit, B. 1 to 15, and other authorities mentioned in the note:\nIt may, in general terms, be said to consist either in some right, interest, profit, or benefit, accruing to the party, who makes the contract, or some forbearance, detriment, loss, responsibility, or act, or labour, or service, on the other side. And, if either of these exists, it will furnish a sufficient valuable consideration to sustain the drawing, indorsing, or accepting a bill of exchange in favour of the payee or other holder. Thus, for example, not only money paid, or advances made, or credit given, or the discharge of a present debt, or work and labour done, will constitute a sufficient consideration for a bill; but, also, receiving a bill as security for a debt, or forbearance to sue a present claim or debt, or an exchange of securities, or becoming a surety, or doing any other act at the request, or for the benefit, of the drawer, indorser, or acceptor, will constitute a sufficient consideration for a bill. To the same effect is the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber in Currie v. Misa[5].\nIn Smith v. Holmes[6], Parke, B., said that \" an action will be on mutual promises.\"\nIn Westlake v. Adams[7], the defendant, upon the apprenticing of his son to the plaintiff by a charitable society, agreed to give the plaintiff, in addition to a premium of \u00a320 to be paid by the society, four I.O.U's for \u00a35 each, payable at intervals of a year, and the indenture stated the consideration to be \u00a320 payable by the society. The boy served the full term, and the plaintiff sued the defendant upon the last of the I.O.U's. It was held by Willes, J. and Byles, J., Williams, J. dissenting, that the circumstances of the indenture being void by the 39th section of 8 Ann. c. 9, for not truly setting forth the consideration, did not prevent the plaintiff from maintaining his action upon the I.O.U. Byles, J., in his judgment, at p. 265, says\nThe indenture was the very indenture that the plaintiff agreed to give and which the defendant agreed to take. There was no fraud; the defendant knew all the facts and cannot be heard to say that he was ignorant of the law. It cannot even be said that the deed, though liable to be proved to be void, was valueless; for, it was a good deed on the face of it, and had the evidence of the additional consideration perished, or not been forthcoming, the deed would. have had its full operation in every way.\nIt is an elementary principle, that the law will not enter into an inquiry as to the adequacy of the consideration; so that much less consideration than here existed might have sufficed. Lastly, it must be remembered that the defendant in this case has received a full performance of the terms of the indenture at the hands of the plaintiff. The jury have, I think, made an end of the question; for, they have found (as they well might) that the defendant received what he bargained for, and all that he bargained for.\nThe only difficulty I feel, is, in distinguishing this case from the case of Jackson v. Warwick[8]. But that was an action on a promissory note: the defendant had there certainly received some consideration: and the law was not at that time so well settled as it has since been, that an action to recover the full amount due on a bill or note can be sustained unless the consideration fails entirely, or fails to an ascertained and liquidated amount,\nThe case had been .tried by Willes, J., with a jury, and his direction was, in substance, that the indenture of apprenticeship was void by the statute for not truly setting out the consideration; \"but that,\" see pp. 261 and 262 of the report, if the consideration for the I.O.U. upon which the action was brought was the execution of the indenture, notwithstanding it might be void, such execution was a sufficient consideration for the promise.\nAnd, in discharging the rule for a new trial at, the conclusion of the case, the learned judge said\nI am not ashamed of having been somewhat astute at the trial to defeat what I conceived to be an unjust and unworthy defence: and of course I do not express any different opinion now.\nThe well known cases of Cook v. Wight[9], and Newcombe J. Calisher v. Bischoffscheim[10], both decided by Blackburn, J and Lord Justice Bowen's judgment in Miles v. New Zealand Alford Estate Co.[11], were approved by Lord Atkinson in the Privy Council, in a Ceylon case, Jayawickreme v. Amarasuriya,[12].\nIn Crears v. Hunter[13], it was held by the Court of Appeal that forbearance by the plaintiff at the defendant's request constituted sufficient consideration, even in the absence of a promise. Lopes, L.J., at p. 346 states the law thus,\nIn this case the question is whether there was evidence of a consideration for the making of this note by the defendant. The law appears to be that a promise to forbear is a good consideration, but also that actual forbearance at the request, express or implied, of the defendant would be a good consideration.\nIn Fullerton v. Provincial Bank of Ireland[14], upon the question of consideration, Lord McNaghten held the point to be settled by authority that\nIt is quite enough if you can infer from the surrounding circumstances that there was an implied request for forbearance for a time, and that forbearance for a reasonable time was in fact extended to the person who asked for it.\nAnd His Lordship referred to Oldershaw v. King[15], Alliance Bank v. Broom[16], and Miles v. New Zealand Alford Estate Co.[17], and he added that \"the proposition seems to be good sense \".\nIn Dunlop Pneumatic Tire Co. v. Selfridge & Co.[18], Lord Dunedin said\nMy Lords, I am content to adopt from a work of Sir Frederick Pollock, to which I have often been under obligation, the following words as to consideration: \"An act or forbearance of one party, or the promise thereof, is the price for which the promise of the other is bought, and the promise thus given for value is enforceable.\u201d (Pollock on Contracts, 8th ed., p. 175.)\nI would have thought that the question as to whether Mr. Ross\u2019s agreement of 1920 to contribute to the Endowment Fund was binding and enforceable would naturally fall to be determined by the law of Quebec, the province in which the parties resided and made the agreement and where it was meant to be performed; but, if that question is governed by the law of Quebec, the appellant\u2019s difficulty is greater and becomes even more obvious. It is true that the rules of the common law of England, including the law merchant, apply to bills of exchange and promissory notes, because the Parliament of Canada has, by the Bills of Exchange Act, so declared in the exercise of its exclusive legislative authority over that subject; but the Dominion legislation does not and was not intended to affect a subscriber\u2019s liability to implement his subscription, and, as I understood the argument, no contention to the contrary was submitted.\nI quote articles 982 and 984 of the Civil Code of Quebec:\n982. It is essential to an obligation that it should have a cause from which it arises, persons between whom it exists, and an object.\n984. There are four requisites to the validity of a contract:\nParties legally capable of contracting;\nTheir consent legally given;\nSomething which forms the object of the contract;\nA lawful cause or consideration.\nIt is essential therefore that an obligation shall have \u201ca cause from which it arises\u201d, and that a contract shall have \u201ca lawful cause or consideration\u201d; but it is not meant that a, contract which has a lawful cause within the meaning of article 984 C.C. shall be void or defective for lack of that which, under the English authorities, would constitute valuable consideration. Pothier\u2019s view is expressed in the second edition of his works by Professor Bugnet, 3 and 42. Under the latter number he says\n42. Tout engagement doit avoir une cause honn\u00eate.\nDans les contrats int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, la cause de l\u2019engagement que contracte l\u2019une des parties est ce que l\u2019autre partie lui donne, ou s\u2019engage de lui donner, ou le risque dont elle se charge. Dans les contrats de bienfaisance, la lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 que l\u2019une des parties veut exercer envers l\u2019autre, est une cause suffisante de l\u2019engagement qu\u2019elle contracte envers elle. Mais lorsqu\u2019un engagement n\u2019a aucune cause, ou, ce qui est la m\u00eame chose, lorsque la cause pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9, est une cause fausse, l\u2019engagement est nul, et le contract qui le renferme est nul. Article 1131 of the Code Civil provides that\n1131. L\u2019obligation sans cause, ou sur une fausse cause, ou sur une cause illicite, ne peut avoir aucun effet.\nM. Rogron, in the 19th edition of his commentaries, at pp. 4236-7, explains the words \u201csans cause\u201d in this article as follows:\nSans cause. La cause est ce qui d\u00e9termine rengagement que prend une partie dans un contrat; il ne faut pas la confondre avec la cause, implicite du contrat, autrement dit le motif qui porte \u00e0 contracter. La cause de l\u2019engagement d\u2019une partie est le fait ou la promesse de \u013eautre partie; elle peut aussi consister dans une pure lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 de la part de \u013eune des parties: ainsi, lorsque je m\u2019oblige \u00e0 payer mille francs \u00e0 Paul pour tels services que son p\u00e8re m\u2019a rendus, la cause d\u00e9terminante du contrat, ce sont les services qui m\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus; si celui-ci ne m\u2019a jamais rendu les services dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 parl\u00e9 dans l\u2019acte, le contrat est sans cause, mais au cas o\u00f9 l\u2019acte ne mentionnait point ces services le contrat pourrait \u00eatre maintenu, si les juges d\u00e9cident par l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des circonstances que le d\u00e9sir de m\u2019acquitter de services plus ou moins r\u00e9els a \u00e9t\u00e9 le motif et non la cause de mon engagement. Je m\u2019oblige \u00e0 donner mille francs \u00e0 Paul pour qu\u2019il suive une affaire pendante devant le tribunal de la Seine: la cause d\u00e9terminante est la promesse de Paul qu\u2019il suivra mon affaire; si elle est jug\u00e9e irr\u00e9vocablement au moment o\u00f9 nous avons stipul\u00e9, le contrat est sans cause. Enfin je donne, dans la forme des dispositions entre vifs, ma maison \u00e0 Paul, qui l\u2019accepta: ma lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 est ici la seule cause du contrat.\nProfessor Langdell also quotes M. Rogron\u2019s comment in a note to Thomas v. Thomas[19], in his select cases on Contracts, Part I, 2nd ed., p. 169.\nI extract the following paragraph from Sir Frederick Pollock\u2019s Principles of Contract at p. 185.\nNo one ever argued before an English temporal court that deliberate bounty or charitable intention will support a formless promise; but such was undoubtedly the canonical view, and is to this day, in theory, the rule of legal systems which have followed the modern Roman law. There was no room within the common law scheme of actions for turning natural into legal obligation.\nAnd the note is\n(y) Pothier, obi. para. 42; Sirey and Gilbert on Code Nap. 1131; Demolombe, Cours du Code Nap. xxiv. 329 sqq.; Langdell, Sel. Ca. Cont. 169; so in Germany from the 17th century onwards, with only theoretical differences as to the reason of the rule: Seuffert, Zur Gesch. der obligatorischen Vertr\u00e4ge, 130 sqq.\nMy interpretation of the authorities, as applicable to the facts of this case, leads me to the view that there were both lawful cause and consideration for Mr. Ross\u2019s subscription, within the meaning of the Civil Code of Quebec; and that, as to the note, by the giving of which Mr. Ross, at his urgent request, secured an extension of the time limited for the payment of the balance of his subscription, the consideration was valuable and satisfied the requirements of the common law and of the Bills of Exchange Act.\nA considerable part of the appellant's argument was devoted to a contention that a promissory note cannot be the subject of a gift by the maker to the payee; but it is not necessary to determine that question in this case if, as I think, the note was intended not as a gift, but as evidence of the maker's promise, in consideration of the extension of his term of credit, to pay the balance of his subscription in accordance with the tenor of the note.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cook & Magee.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ewing & McFadden.\n[1] Q.R. 50 K.B. 107.\n[2] Q.R. 68 S.C. 354.\n[3] Reporter\u2019s Note: Rinfret and Cannon JJ. also concurred with Newcombe J.\n[4] (1588) Cro.

V, c. 28, s. 15 (amending s. 1025, Cr. Code).\nLegislation conferring a new jurisdiction on an appellate court to entertain an appeal cannot be construed retrospectively, so as to cover cases arising prior to such legislation, unless there is something making unmistakeable the legislative intention that it should be so construed. The matter is one of substance and of right. (Doran v. Jewell, 49 Can. S.C.R. 88; Upper Canada College v. Smith, 61 Can. S.C.R. 413).\nIn the present case, held, that 21-22 Geo. V, c. 28, s. 15 (amending s. 1025 of the Cr. Code) did not give a right to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the sustaining of the appellant\u2019s conviction by a judgment of the Appellate Division, Ont., rendered prior to such legislation.\nAPPEAL by the defendant from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], dismissing his appeal from his conviction by Wright J.[2] of offences against the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 26, and of conspiracy, contrary to the provisions of s. 498, subs. 1 (a), (b) and (d) of the Criminal Code.\nSinger, the present appellant, was tried jointly with others, namely, Belyea, Weinraub, O\u2019Connor, Paddon and Ward. At the trial, Singer, Paddon and Ward were found guilty; and Belyea, Weinraub and O\u2019Connor were found not guilty2 Singer, Paddon and Ward appealed from their conviction; and the Attorney-General for Ontario (under the provisions of the Act of 1930, 20-21 Geo. V, c. 11, s. 28, amending the Criminal Code) appealed against the acquittal of Belyea and Weinraub. The Appellate Division1 dismissed the appeals of Singer, Paddon and Ward; and allowed the appeals of the Attorney-General, and set aside the acquittal of Belyea and Weinraub and adjudged them guilty.[3]\nThe present appeal was brought under s. 1025 of the Criminal Code (R.S.C., 1927, c. 36), as amended by 21-22 Geo. V (1931), c. 28, s. 15. By said amending Act (s. 15), the following was substituted for subs. 3 of said s. 1025:\n3. Any person whose acquittal has been set aside may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the setting aside of such acquittal, and any person who was tried jointly with such acquitted person, and whose conviction was sustained by the Court of Appeal, may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the sustaining of such conviction.\nThe present appellant was convicted on March 23, 1931, and his conviction was sustained by the Appellate Division on June 26, 1931. The said amending Act, which was assented to on August 3, 1931, provided (s. 16) that it should come into force on September 1, 1931.\nA question of jurisdiction arose, counsel for the respondent contending that no appeal lay; that the said amendment, which was subsequent to the judgment in question of the Appellate Division, was not retroactive, and upon the delivery of the judgment the conviction was affirmed, and the right of appeal must date from the rights in law existing at the time of the delivery of judgment.\nW.F. O\u2019Connor K.C. for the appellant.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. and J.C. McRuer K.C. for the respondent. At the opening of the hearing of the appeal, argument was heard upon the question of jurisdiction, and after hearing counsel for the parties, the Court retired for a few minutes for consideration and, on its returning to the Bench, the Chief Justice delivered judgment orally as follows:\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The appeal in this case was taken under s. 15, c. 28, Stats. of Canada, 1931, which became law on the 1st of September, 1931. The appellant was convicted on the 23rd of March, 1931, and his conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal on the 26th of June, 1931.\nIt is common ground that, unless there is something making unmistakeable the intention of the Legislature that a retrospective construction should be put upon the legislation so that it may cover cases arising prior thereto, no clause, conferring a new jurisdiction on an appellate court to entertain an appeal, can be so construed. The matter is one of substance and of right.\nThe decision in Doran v. Jewell[4], is binding upon us and is conclusive to that effect. If further authority be required on this point, it may be found in Upper Canada College v. Smith[5].\nThe language relied upon here, as indicative of the intention of the Legislature to require a retrospective construction of the Act, consists merely in the fact that the perfect tense is used in dealing with the matter. This, however, is legislation in regard to appeals, where it seems almost inevitable that the past, or perfect, tense should be used, as the matter dealt with, viz., the conviction in the judgment appealed from, must necessarily be an event of the past when the appeal is taken. At all events, we find nothing in the language of the Legislature in this amendment to the Criminal Code indicative of an intention that it should receive a retrospective construction.\nAppeal quashed.\n[1] [1931] O.R. 699.\n[2] [1931] O.R. 202.\n[3] The said Belyea and Weinraub have appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n[4] (1914) 49 Can.

The testator directed that, after his wife\u2019s death, the residue of his property should be divided equally amongst his children, with provision for issue taking a deceased child\u2019s share. A daughter C. died in 1919, having disposed of her property by will. A daughter E. died in 1926, unmarried. The present question was whether there had been vested in C., and so passed under her will, a share of the remainder in the property devised for life to E.; or whether, as claimed by appellant, a child of C., such share in the remainder belonged to C.\u2019s issue.\nHeld: There was established a vesting in C., prior to her death, of a share of the remainder in question, which share passed under her will. If such remainder fell into the testator\u2019s residuary estate, the question of the vesting in C. of a share therein was res judicata by virtue of a consent order made in June, 1912, declaring the right of the testator\u2019s daughters to their share in the residue and ordering realization and distribution of the residuary estate; that order was binding until set aside by an action brought for that purpose; and the present appellant, who was represented by counsel on the motion for the order, could not now be heard to say that he was not bound thereby (Kinch v. Walcott, [1929] A.C. 482; Ainsworth v. Wilding, [1896] 1 Ch. 673; Firm of R.M.K.R.M. v. Firm of M.R.M.V.L., [1926] A.C. 761, at 771). If there was an intestacy as to such remainder (and if that view was now open, having regard to said order), then it had vested on the testator\u2019s death, and C., as one of his heirs at law, could dispose by will of her share therein.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], which, reversing judgment of McEvoy J.[2], held that a share in the remainder in certain property, devised by the will of John William Drummond, deceased, to his daughter Evaline Eliza Drummond for life, had become vested (subject to be divested in certain events) in the testator\u2019s daughter Charlotte Elizabeth Benn before her death and had passed under her will; the present appellant contending to the contrary, and claiming that the children of Charlotte Elizabeth Benn were now entitled to the share of the remainder in question.\nThe appeal to this Court was dismissed with costs.\nA. Courtney Kingstone K.C. for the appellant.\nN.W. Rowell K.C., A.W. Marquis K.C. and J.B. Allen for the respondents the executors of the J.H. Benn Estate.\nJ.D. Bissett K.C. for the respondent, Trustee of the estate of John William Drummond, deceased.\nR.S. Robertson K.C. for Isabel Segsworth (one of the daughters of John William Drummond, deceased), and the Administrator of the Estate of Evaline Drummond.\nMcGregor Young K.C., the Official Guardian, representing any unborn children.\nHamilton Cassels for the respondents Edith A. Werden, Albert D. Werden, and William A. Werden (children of Hester Amelia Werden, deceased, a daughter of John William Drummond, deceased).\nGeorge C. Campbell K.C. for the respondent Laura Pearen (a daughter of John William Drummond, deceased).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN C.J.C.\u2014The question for consideration in this case is, whether or not the remainders after the individual life interests in the several properties devised by the testator to his five daughters (and, more particularly, whether or not the remainder in the property which was the subject of the devise made in the 5th paragraph of the testator\u2019s will in favour of his daughter Evaline Eliza for life), on his death in 1881, in the cases of properties devised to daughters who left no issue, had vested, either, as on an intestacy, in the testator\u2019s heirs-at-law, or, as part of the residue devised by him in the 10th clause of his will, in his surviving children (other than the life tenant of each parcel) and the children of such of the other four as might die leaving issue before the period thereby fixed for the division of the residue. If the interests of those entitled on the death of any one of the five life tenants, who should die without leaving issue, should be regarded as having been vested on the testator\u2019s death, although subject to be divested in the event of such life tenant leaving children, it follows that the interest of Charlotte Elizabeth Benn (one of the five daughters of the testator), who died on the 12th day of May, 1919, (leaving her surviving as her sole and only children, the appellant Wellesley Drummond Benn and his sister, Edna Ravelle Hunter (since deceased)), in the parcel devised for life to her sister, Evaline Eliza Drummond (who died unmarried in September, 1926), was capable of being disposed of, and was disposed of, by her will and passed thereunder.\nClauses 5 and 10 of the will in question read:\n5th. Subject to my wife\u2019s life estate I give to my daughter Evalina Eliza to be held by her for and during her natural life the north half of Lot ten on Yonge street in the City of Toronto as laid down on a plan of Park lot eight made by John Lynn D.P.S. for one Peter McGill (together with the buildings thereon) but in case the centre line of the wall between the second and third stores is not co-incident with the centre line of the lot then the centre line of the said wall and such centre line produced at right angles to Yonge Street shall be the division line between the north and south halves of the lot as intended to be hereby devised and after the death of my said daughter Evaline I give the said north half as herein defined to such children as may have been born of my said daughter Evaline as are living at the time of her death and to the children of such as may be dead to be held by them in fee, the children of a deceased child to take such share as their parent would have taken if such parent had not predeceased his or her mother.\n* * *\n10th. I direct that after the death of my wife and upon my youngest daughter attaining the age of twenty-one years the residue of the property whereof I shall die possessed or entitled to shall subject to the eighteenth paragraph of this my will be divided by my executors equally amongst my said children and in the event of the decease of any of my children leaving issue before such division I direct that the issue of such child or children shall receive respectively the share of such property to which such deceased child or children would have been severally entitled.\nClause 18 of the will has no bearing upon the question now before the court, that being merely a provision made to enable the executors in certain events to equalize the several shares in value.\nOf course, if there was an intestacy as to the remainder in the property devised to Evaline Eliza Drummond for life, no question need arise as to the construction of the residuary clause. That view, however,\u2014although not a little may be said in support of it\u2014is probably not open, when regard is had to what is stated below about the order of Middleton J. of the 20th of June, 1912. In the result, in that view, however, the judgment appealed from would have been substantially right in holding that the remainder in the parcel devised to Evaline Eliza for life had been vested on the testator\u2019s death, and that Charlotte Elizabeth Benn, as one of the testator\u2019s heirs-at-law, had effectually disposed of her interest therein by her will.\nOn the other hand, if an intestacy as to the remainders of the life estates given to such of the five daughters as died childless be not the correct view, or if that view be not open, and the remainder in each of the five parcels devised to the testator\u2019s several daughters, as part of the residue, fell into the residuary estate, as seems to have been agreed to by all parties interested before Middleton J., we are inclined to think the question res judicata by virtue of the consent order of that learned judge of the 20th of June, 1912, clauses 9 and 10 of which read:\n9. And This Court Doth Further Declare that the daughters of the said John William Drummond, deceased, (other than Laura Pearen) are entitled to their share in the residue of the said estate absolutely.\n10. And This Court Doth Further Order that the said trustee do forthwith proceed to get in and realize and distribute the residuary estate in accordance with the terms of the said Will subject to the above declaration.\nHester Ann Drummond, the testator\u2019s widow, having died on the 23rd of March, 1912, and Evaline Eliza Drummond being then unmarried and at least one of the other daughters being married but without children, this identical question as to the effect of the residuary clause (No. 10) of the will upon the vesting, as part of the residue, of the remainders in each of the five properties devised to the several daughters must have been present to the minds of the parties when they consented to the order of Mr. Justice Middleton, and, also, to the mind of that learned judge when he pronounced the order. We can discover no justification, therefore, for the view that it was not intended by the order of Middleton J. to deal with the very matter now before the court and to determine that question in favour of the respondents; neither can we understand the view being now taken that the residue of the estate referred to in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the order is not identical with the residue dealt with in the 10th paragraph of the will. Clause 10 of the order seems to indicate clearly that it is.\nWe are, therefore, of the opinion that the order of Mr. Justice Middleton is to be taken as having been meant to dispose of the very question now before us. It is perfectly clear that that order is binding until set aside by an action brought for that purpose, and that the present plaintiff, Wellesley Drummond Benn, who was represented upon the motion by counsel, cannot now be heard to say that he is not bound thereby. Kinch v. Walcott[3]; Ainsworth v. Wilding[4]; Firm of R.M.K.R.M. v. Firm of M.R.M.V.L.[5]\nThe result is that the vesting of a share of the property, devised for life to Evaline Eliza Drummond, in Charlotte Elizabeth Benn, one of the daughters of the testator, prior to her death which occurred on the 12th of May, 1919, has been established.\nThe appeal is, accordingly, dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ingersoll, Kingstone & Seymour.\nSolicitors for the respondents, the Executors of the J.H.

Co., and some to the C.P.R. Co., for certain fractional sections of land in the North-West Territories (within what is now the province of Saskatchewan), which fractional sections then abutted on Rush Lake (held to be non-navigable). The only survey at that time of lands in Rush Lake\u2019s vicinity was that of 1883, and was of land not covered by water. The patents made no reference to the survey nor to Rush Lake. The descriptions in the patents were all in form such as follows: \u201cAll that parcel or tract of land, situate * * * in the 17th township * * * and being composed of the whole (fractional) of section 12 of the said township, containing by admeasurement 127 acres more or less.\u201d The survey of 1883 shewed the edge of Rush Lake as a meandered line, and the area of each fractional section bordering on the lake was shown, on the map, on that fractional section. The rights of the C.A.C. & \u0421. Co. to its lands were acquired under an agreement in 1887 (made pursuant to an Order in Council) in which the Dominion Government agreed to sell 50,000 acres, 5,000 acres at each of ten points, of which Rush Lake was one, at the price of $1.50 per acre and performance of certain cultivation conditions, which acreage the company selected and paid for. The rights of the C.P.R. Co. to its lands were acquired under agreement of October 21, 1880, appended to and ratified by \u0441. 1 of 44 Vict. (Dom.). In 1903-4, the C.P.R. Co., for the purposes of straightening its railway line, made a drain to lower the waters, and the effect was to make bare \u00e1 large extent of land formerly part of the lake bed. In 1909 the respondents acquired title to the fractional sections in question (on the same descriptions of the lands as in the patents). In the present action they claimed, as being successors in title to the patentees and riparian owners, to be entitled to all the land in front of their fractional sections to the centre of Rush Lake, or, in any event, to the remainders of the whole sections respectively (which remainders had become dry owing to the recession of the waters). Held: Respondents were not entitled to the land so claimed. Judgment of the Exchequer Court (Maclean J.), [1929] Ex. C.R. 144, reversed.\nUnder English law, the presumptive rule for construing a conveyance as a grant ad medium filum aquae is rebutted if an intention to exclude it is indicated in the language of the conveyance or is reasonably to be inferred from the subject matter or the surrounding circumstances. (Dwyer v. Rich, I.R. 6 C.L. 144, at 149; City of London Tax Commrs. v. Central London Ry. Co., [1913] A.C. 364, at 372, and other cases cited). Likewise, assuming that said presumptive rule would otherwise apply in the Territories (North-West Ter\u0144to\u0144es Act, R.S.C., 1886, c. 50, s. 11; semble, the rule was not entirely excluded from the general body of English law as introduced into the region\u2014per Duff and Rinfret JJ.; Lamont and Cannon JJ. inclining to the same view), and would apply there to such a body of water as Rush Lake, yet the rule would be excluded if the Dominion statute law applicable to the Territories satisfactorily disclosed an intention inconsistent with its application. And, per Anglin C.J.C., the Dominion statute law in force when the patents in question were issued indicated, as the proper inference therefrom, an intention to exclude the application of the rule to grants of Crown lands in the North-West Territories. (Lamont and Cannon JJ. were inclined to the same view, but based their decision on the interpretation, as stated below, of the patents and agreements from the Crown. Duff and Rinfret JJ. held that where lands were acquired through the commoner transactions sanctioned by the Dominion Lands Act\u2014homestead entry, preemption entry, sale at a given price per acre\u2014the presumption must necessarily be excluded in order to give full effect to the intent of the statutory provisions.) (Dominion Lands Acts, R.S.C., 1886, c. 54, particularly ss. 3, 8, 14, 29, 32, 129, 130, 131; 1879, \u0441. 31, particularly ss. 30, 34; Ter\u0144to\u0144es Real Property Act, R.S.C., 1886, \u0441. 51, referred to.) Also, the patents, and the agreements under which the lands were acquired from the Crown, and the circumstances of the purchase, (all as interpreted in the light of the statutory provisions), indicated, as the reasonable inference therefrom, that there was no intention that the ad medium filum rule should apply, but that the patents to the fractional sections now in question should be granted and accepted as covering only the acreage therein set out.\nDuff and Rinfret JJ. further held that, even assuming that the presumption ad medium filum took effect and that, by force of the presumption, strips of the bed of the lake ex adverso passed to the grantees from the Crown, yet, on the subsidence of the lake in 1904, the land expressly described in each grant ceased to be riparian land, and, to a conveyance of this land to respondents under that express description, land not in contact with the lake, the presumption could not apply; no equitable right of respondents had been alleged or proved. (Anglin C.J.C. doubted whether the Crown should be allowed to set up the fact of the subsequent transfers in reference to the present claim; and was inclined to the opinion that, although respondents must succeed by the strength of their own title, they had an equitable, if not legal, right to everything granted by the Crown to their predecessors in title.)\nAPPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of Maclean J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding that, according to the true construction of the grants from the Crown (in the right of the Dominion of Canada) of the whole (fractional) of sections 12, 13 and 14, in township 17, range 11, and of the whole (fractional) of sections 9, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20, in township 17, range 10, all west of the 3rd meridian, in the Dominion of Canada (said land being within what is now the province of Saskatchewan), there was granted by the Crown to the grantees all the lands bounded by and abutting on Rush Lake, to the centre of the lake in front of said sections and more particularly all of sections 12, 13 and 14, in township 17, range 11, and all of sections 9, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20, in township 17, range 10, all west of the 3rd meridian; and that the suppliants (the present respondents) are now the owners of the said lands, excepting out of any of said lands those portions now vested in the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are sufficiently set out in the judgments now reported, and are indicated in the above headnote. The appeal to this Court was allowed with costs.\nR. V. Sinclair, K.C., for the appellant.\nE. F. Newcombe, K.C., and W. C. Hamilton, K.C., for the respondents.\nAnglin, C.J.C.\u2014I have had the advantage of perusing the carefully prepared opinions of my brothers Duff and Lamont. While they may differ in some details, as I read what they have written, they agree in holding that, assuming the ad medium filum rule of English law to be ordinarily applicable in Saskatchewan to non-navigable waters, such as the lake in question, it is, at the highest, a rule of interpretation, and the rebuttable presumption thereby created yields readily to proof either of circumstances inconsistent with its application, or of the expressed intention of a competent Legislature so to exclude its application. With that view, I entirely agree (Keewatin Power Co. v. Kenora[2]), and I also agree that the intention of the Dominion Parliament\u2014an authority competent so to provide\u2014to exclude the application of the rule to Dominion lands in the North West Territories, was sufficiently manifested by the provisions of the Dominion Lands Act (c. 54, R.S.C. 1886).\nI had occasion some years ago in Keewatin Power Co. v. Kenora[3], to consider the applicability of the ad medium filum rule in Ontario. Notwithstanding the reversal of my decision by the Ontario Court of Appeal[4], with the utmost respect, I still entertain the opinion which I then held. The difference between my view and the view taken by the Court of Appeal was this: in my opinion, notwithstanding the general adoption of English law in Upper Canada effected by the Act of 1792, only so much of that body of law as was suitable to the conditions of that province was thus brought in. The Court of Appeal, on the contrary, took the view that, the words of the statute being absolute and unqualified, the entire body of English law, as it stood at the date of the Act in question, was thereby introduced, including the provisions thereof which might not be suitable to the circumstances of the province. That question, fortunately, does not arise here owing to the wording of the North-West Territories Act, which expressly limits the provisions of English law introduced by it (R.S.C., 1886, c. 50, s. 11) by the words, \u201cin so far as the same are applicable to the Territories.\u201d Moreover, the introduction of English law thus effected was made subject to repeal, alteration, variation, modification, or other affection thereof, by, inter alia, any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe restriction of the application of the ad medium filum rule in Saskatchewan rests on legislation of the Parliament of Canada. See sections 3, 8, 129, 130, 131 of the Dominion Lands Act, c. 54, R.S.C., 1886,\u2014provisions which were in force when the grants in question were issued in 1888 by the Crown,\u2014and the Territories Real Property Act (c. 51, R.S.C., 1886), providing for the adoption in the Territories of the Torrens System of land transfer. I think that these provisions indicate an intention on the part of Parliament,\n1. To have a definite clear cut system of survey of all lands coming under the Dominion Lands Act, in which a section should be an integral part of a township and should consist generally of 640 acres; 2. That the boundary lines thereof should run from one corner post or monument to another, each of which should be as nearly as possible a mile in length;\n3. That these lines should be the \u201ctrue and unalterable boundaries\u201d of the section (s. 129) and that the section should consist of the whole width between the corner posts respectively \u201cand no more or less\u201d (s. 130); and\n4. To provide by section 29 of the Dominion Lands Act for a price per acre of surveyed lands to be fixed by Order in Council.\nThe inference proper to be drawn therefrom, in my opinion, is the indication of an intention by Parliament to exclude the application of the ad medium filum rule of construction of English law to grants of Crown lands in those Territories.\nMy conclusion that this appeal should be allowed rests solely upon the inapplicability of the ad medium filum rule and has been reached entirely independently of the view pressed by counsel for the Crown as to the effect of the subsequent conveyances. I doubt whether the Crown should be allowed to set up the fact of those subsequent transfers in reference to the present claim. While, owing to privity of estate, they may not have been strictly res inter alios acta, they were certainly closely akin thereto. Although, no doubt, the plaintiff must succeed by the strength of his own title, the equitable, if not the legal, right of the respondent to everything granted by the Crown to his predecessors in title would seem to be reasonably apparent.\nThe judgment of Duff and Rinfret JJ. was delivered by\nDuff J.\u2014Some questions of general interest which were rather elaborately discussed by counsel may be very summarily disposed of. That the presumptive rule ad medium filum, to employ a convenient label, was not entirely excluded from the general body of English law as introduced into the region later known as the Canadian Territories, is not susceptible of serious dispute. Lord v. Commissioners of Sydney[5]. To what extent it is open to the courts to hold that the rule was varied on its introduction, by force of the principle that the common law as introduced into a new colonial settlement must be regarded as modified, in so far as that may be necessary in order to make it reasonably capable of adaptation to the circumstances of the new country, it is unnecessary now to examine.\nBy the common law itself the presumption with which we are concerned applies to the beds of non-tidal rivers, whether subject to public rights of navigation or not; and powerful arguments may be advanced for the proposition that under the common law there is at least no general rule excluding its application to the beds of lakes.\nThe conclusion of the learned President that Rush Lake was not at the critical period navigable, in any pertinent sense, is unassailable; and I shall assume for the purposes of this judgment that the presumption would apply to such a body of water as Rush Lake, and that it would govern the rights of riparian proprietors there, unless the rule after its introduction was abrogated by competent legislative authority, or unless by reason of provisions in such statutes as the Land Titles Act, the Dominion Lands Act or the North-West Territories Act it was so affected in its operation as to make it inapplicable either wholly or in some particular class of cases.\nThe prima facie rule, which declares a presumption or embodies a principle of construction, may be overborne by circumstances establishing satisfactorily a contrary intention.\nThe presumptive construction is not excluded by the fact that the lands are described by reference to a plan by colour and by quantity, or by metes and bounds, so long as the land is shewn to be bounded by the body of water or by the highway as the case may be. Central London Railway Co. v. City of London Land Tax Commissioners[6]; Thames Conservators v. Kent[7]; Maclaren v. Attorney-General for Quebec[8]. Blackburn J., in Plum-stead Board of Works v. British Land Co.[9], used these words:\nAnd it is not enough to rebut that presumption (the presumption ad medium filum aquae or viae) to say that it is designated as adjoining to or abutting on that road or river, and this even if there was a mention of the acreage. But * * * it always has been held to be enough when there is anything to shew that it was not the intention to convey any part of the road.\nThe scope and application of the rule for our present purpose is very clearly stated by Fitzgerald J., in Dwyer v. Rich[10], in these words: \u201cThe authorities adverted to in the course of the argument establish, as a general rule of construction, that where land adjoining a highway or inland river is granted, the prima facie presumption\u201d (this is also the phrase used by Blackburn J. in the last mentioned case)\nis that the parties intended to include in the grant a moiety of the road or of the river bed, as the case may be; and that such general presumption ought to prevail, unless there is something to indicate a contrary intention. * * * To rebut the general presumption, there must be something in the language of the grant indicating an intention to exclude or something in the subject matter or in the surrounding circumstances from which such an intention may reasonably be inferred.\nAgain, in Micklethwait v. Newlay Bridge Co.[11], Cotton L.J. says:\nThere may be facts, whether appearing on the face of the conveyance or not, from which it is justly inferred that it was not the intention of the parties that the general presumption should apply.\n\u201cNo doubt\u201d said Lord Atkinson in City of London Tax Commissioners v. Central London Ry. Co.[12], \u201cthe presumption may be rebutted, either by the provisions of a grant or conveyance or by the surrounding circumstances\u201d\nThe observation of Lord Moulton in Maclaren v. Attorney-General for Quebec[13], was directed to a case where the sole question concerned the effect of the language of documents of title. The passage does not contemplate a case such as the present; and, when the controversy relates to the construction of a conveyance executed under statutory authority, it cannot properly be read as excluding from consideration the statutory provisions which prescribe the conditions of the transaction.\nIn Duke of Devonshire v. Pattison[14], Fry, L.J., delivering the judgment of Lord Esher, Bowen, L.J., and himself, said:\nThey have further contended that this presumption can be repelled only by words in the deed itself. In our opinion, this latter contention cannot be maintained, for we hold that the presumption may equally be rebutted by the circumstances under which the deed was executed.\nDecisions in which the circumstances were treated as displacing the prima jacie rule are numerous. In Marquis of Salisbury v. Great Northern Ry. Co.[15], the presumption was held to be rebutted where there was a conveyance to a railway company, purchasing under their statutory power, on the grounds that before the conveyance the company had, in their deposited plans and book of reference, treated the road as being vested in turnpike trustees and that the conveyance exactly carried out that view. In Pry or v. Petre[16], the lands were described in a schedule by reference to the numbers on the ordinance map, on which the road in question was separately numbered; the number assigned to the road not being included in the schedule. Moreover, the road was a \u201cgrassy lane\u201d in which there were some trees for which grantee had not paid; although he had paid for the trees on the land specifically. These circumstances were regarded as sufficient to override the prima facie construction. Again, in Ecroyd v. Coulthard[17], it was held by the trial judge, North J., that the presumption does not apply to awards under the Inclosure Acts unless the bed of the river or half of it is shewn to be part of the waste of the manor over which the tenants have right of common; and this view was approved by Lindley M.R., Chitty L.J., and Collins L.J., in the Court of Appeal[18].\nConsidering the applicability of the presumption to a patent under the Dominion Lands Act, it is necessary to ask oneself how far the pr\u00edma facie construction is consistent with the provisions of the Act under the authority of which the land is granted.\nThe provisions of the Dominion Lands Act do not, in themselves, directly, or by necessary inference, effect a general repeal of the presumptive rule; but, when the provisions of the statute are viewed as a whole, those prescribing the rules for the acquisition of title, together with those relating to survey and division, there is ample warrant for concluding, where lands are acquired through the commoner transactions sanctioned by the Act (homestead entry, preemption entry, sale at a given price per acre), that the presumption must necessarily be excluded in order to give full effect to the intent of those provisions.\nThe identity of the parcels severally described in the grants in question and the boundaries of the parcels as so described, are established beyond dispute.\nThe parcels, when surveyed and when granted, were riparian properties, in the sense that on one side they were limited by the shore of Rush Lake, as surveyed in 1883, the other boundaries being rectilinear, and drawn and laid out in compliance with the normal practice in surveying lands for settlement under the Dominion Lands Act of 1879. These boundaries are delineated on the official plan of a survey made and confirmed in 1883 which is in evidence; and there is also in evidence a traverse of the shore of the lake of the same year. The respondents contend and the Court below has held that, by force of the presumptive rule, the patents of these several pieces of riparian lands vested, in each case, in the patentee, the title to a strip of the bed of the lake, ex adverso the lands explicitly described in the patent, extending from the shore line, as surveyed, to the middle of the lake. My conclusion is that such a construction of the grants cannot in the circumstances be accepted because to accept it would be inconsistent with the policy of the Dominion Lands Act, and in particular with certain specific enactments of the statute; and that this is sufficient to overcome the presumption.\nThe lands granted to the Colonization Co. were purchased under the authority of sec. 29 of the Dominion Lands Act, R.S.C., 1886, Cap. 54, by an arrangement, which, after modifications, ultimately assumed the form of a sale by the Crown of 50,000 odd acres of land not covered by water, at a price, fixed by the Governor in Council, of \u201cnot less than\u201d $1.50 per acre. In point of fact, the aggregate price paid was a few cents more than the price calculated at the minimum rate. These lands included, as already mentioned, no land covered by water, but did include the fractional sections at Rush Lake, the total area of which was about 1,800 acres. It is plain, therefore, that, since the price authorized by the Governor in Council was to be not less than $1.50 per acre, nobody had authority to convey to the Company additional lands for the consideration thus paid, in other words, to make a gift to the Company of such additional lands. Indeed, no such conveyance could have been made without departing from the express enactments of the Dominion Lands Act, which, as it then stood (sec. 29, R.S.C. 1886, \u0441. 54), required the purchase price of lands sold to be fixed from time to time by the Governor in Council, and the only price so fixed was, as already stated, the price of \u201cnot less than\u201d $1.50 per acre.\nThe only fair inference from the facts, interpreted by the light of the statute, is that no lands in addition to the 50,000 acres (that is to say, no lands covered by water), were intended to pass.\nThen the authority to sell, given by section 29, it will be noted, extends to no lands but those which have been surveyed. Unsurveyed lands are outside the scope of that section and I know of nothing in the statute which would permit a grant of unsurveyed lands except under conditions having no place here.\nNow the several strips of the body of the lake ex adverso the several parcels described in the grants, which, as the petitioners contend, passed to the grantees, by force of the grant, in virtue of the ad medium filum rule, could not in any given case be described as \u201csurveyed\u201d lands within the meaning of section 29. There had been no survey of any one of these strips; indeed, the middle line of the lake itself had not been fixed, either by markings on the ground or otherwise. The boundaries of the strips had been in no way determined; the acreage could not be calculated. It was not suggested that there was any order of the Governor in Council applicable to these lands, permitting sales to be made at prices determined in any other than the usual manner, at a given price per acre. The price of the strip as a whole could not therefore be ascertained.\nIt is worth while, on this point, to revert to the Act of 1879, the Consolidated Dominion Lands Act of that year, ch. 31, section 30. The section is in these terms:\n30. Unappropriated Dominion lands, the surveys of which may have been duly made and confirmed, shall, except as otherwise hereinafter provided, be open for purchase at the rate of one dollar per acre; but no such purchase of more than a section, or six hundred and forty acres, shall be made by the same person. Provided that, whenever so ordered by the Minister of the Interior, such unoccupied lands as may be deemed by him expedient from time to time may be withdrawn from ordinary sale or settlement, and offered at public sale (of which sale due and sufficient notice shall be given) at the upset price of one dollar per acre, and sold to the highest bidder:\n2. Provided further, that any legal sub-division or other portion of unappropriated Dominion land which may include a water power, harbour or stone-quarry, shall not be open for purchase at the rate of one dollar per acre, but the same shall be reserved from ordinary sale, to be disposed of in such manner, and on such terms and conditions, as may be fixed by the Governor in Council on the report of the Minister of the Interior.\nThe uniform price fixed, it will be observed, is $1 per acre and the same price was fixed for pre-emptions, sec. 34, subsec. 1. There appears to be no authority anywhere in the Act (of 1879) to vary this price, except in certain special cases, as, for example, where the sale is to take place by public auction, which do not concern us here. It is plain, therefore, that in the survey of these fractional parcels in 1883 for sale or settlement, when the statute of 1879 was in force, the authorized officials must have contemplated the survey of parcels of land, the boundaries and the acreage of which should be fixed and determined so as to make it possible to dispose of them in the ordinary way, by sale or pre-emption, at the statutory price; and the evidence that this was so in fact is explicit. The shore line was run solely for the purpose of ascertaining the acreage of the fractional areas. The officials charged with the administration of the Act had no authority to include, in any sale of these areas, any unsurveyed part of the bed of the lake.\nAs to the lands purchased by the Railway Company, these are fractional sections 9, 13, 17 and 19. These sections had been acquired by the Railway Company under article 11 of its agreement with Her Majesty the Queen which received statutory ratification by Chapter 1 of 44 Vict. That article contemplated the allotment to the Railway of full sections of 640 acres. Where such sections contained \u201clakes and water stretches\u201d the beds of these were not to be counted in computing the 25 million acres to which the Railway Company became entitled under the statute and agreement, although it seems clear enough that the title to the whole section was to pass to the Company. In the case of the four fractional sections mentioned, the patents now in question, which were accepted by the Company, embrace in each case only the fractional section and under any one of these patents the fractional section alone would pass. Now, by the arrangement between the Company and the Government, the Company became entitled to 25 million acres precisely, subject only to the exception relating to the beds of lakes and other water stretches included within the limits of any section granted to the Company. Beds of lakes and water stretches not included in any such section could be acquired by the Company only by selection in accordance with the last clause of article 11. There is no suggestion that such a selection was made by the Company of any part of the bed of Rush Lake. No authority was vested in anybody to convey to the Company any part of the bed of Rush Lake save in pursuance of such a selection. In these circumstances I think the presumption is negatived.\nThe judgment of the learned President of the Exchequer Court is also attacked upon a ground indicated in the \u201cfourth defence\u201d set out in the appeal case. The Crown alleges that the subsidence of the waters of the lake, which resulted from the works of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, occurred some years before the transfers to the respondents by the Canadian Agricultural Coal & Colonization Company. It was this subsidence which laid bare the bed of the lake now claimed by the respondents. There is no dispute about the facts, which are stated by the learned trial judge in his judgment in this passage[19]:\nAt the time the grants of the lands in question were made, the average depth was considerably greater than at present. The Canadian Pacific Railway, in a revision of its main line in this region, in the year 1903, constructed its road bed across a section of Rush Lake for a distance of about two miles, and in order to construct the road bed through the lake with the minimum of material, it lowered the level of the lake by straightening and deepening a small creek leading out of Rush Lake into another lake called Reed Lake; this lowered the water of Rush Lake somewhere between two and three feet. At the north and west ends of the lake, where the banks were low and the water was ordinarily shallow, a considerable area of lake bed became dry; at the east and south ends of the lake where the banks were higher, the recession of the water was not so great. * * * By reason of the recession of the waters of Rush Lake some 3,900 acres of land, it is said, have been reclaimed since the date of the original grants, and this chiefly at the northwest end of the lake.\nThe title set up by the respondents in the petition of right is stated in this way: In the first five paragraphs, grants by the Crown, to the Colonization Company and the Railway Company respectively, of the sections with which we are concerned are alleged. Then in paragraph 6, there is an allegation that these sections, as described in the preceding paragraphs, are bounded on one or more sides by, and abut on, Rush Lake, and that the sections are riparian lands. Then there is an allegation that the petitioners \u201care now\u201d the owners of an estate in fee simple in these sections.\nThe Crown contends that the allegation in paragraph 6, that the sections are riparian lands bounded by and abutting on Rush Lake, not only was not proved, but was disproved.\nI see no answer to this contention of the Crown. Let us assume that the presumption ad medium took effect, and to that, by force of the presumption, strips of the bed of the lake ex adverso, passed to the grantees. The grantees would thereby acquire the right to have these undetermined strips defined, and thereupon, to obtain a legal title to them by registration, but on the subsidence of the lake in 1904, as shown in the plans in evidence, the land expressly described in each grant ceased, admittedly, to be riparian land. To a conveyance of this land under that express description, land not in contact with the lake, the presumption could not apply. It would be just as entirely inapplicable as to a grant by the Crown, before the subsidence occurred, of the part of the section, separated, let us say, by 100 chains, from the shore of the lake. There was some suggestion that the strip would pass as, in some sense, appurtenant to the land, formerly riparian, expressly described. That of course is impossible. The strip was held by a severable title, as was every square inch that passed to the patentee; and land cannot, of course, in point of law, be appurtenant to land. The petitioners had, in some cases at least, procured their title to the lands expressly granted to be registered, and had obtained certificates of title according to the description in the Crown grants. There is no rule of law or rule of construction by which the description\u2014being a description of non-riparian lands\u2014can be read as comprehending any part of an ex adverso strip of the former bed of the lake passing\u2014if anything did pass\u2014under the presumptive rule to the Crown grantee. If any part of the bed of the lake passed to the grantees, it did not pass under the description but under the grant, in virtue of the presumption.\nIt is possible that the petitioners might have established an equitable right. No such right, no fact suggesting such a right, is alleged in the petition. No facts are proved, not a jot of evidence is to be discovered in the record, pointing to the existence of such a right. The petitioners\u2019 case, in the petition and at the trial, was founded upon their title to the lands expressly granted, which by the petition were alleged to be riparian lands. Even in the supplementary written argument equitable title is not advanced. The case of the petitioners failed, completely and obviously, because the fact on which they based their claim, the riparian character of the land transferred to them, was admittedly non-existent.\nWhile one may be permitted to surmise the existence of facts that might have been adduced, in support of an equitable right, one cannot, of course, acting judicially, proceed upon a mere surmise. Moreover it is very doubtful if the necessary amendments to the petition would be competent, with or without the consent of counsel for the Crown. Robertson, Civil Proceedings by and against the Crown, pages 390 and 391. In the circumstances the Court cannot properly refuse to consider the Crown\u2019s contention, which, as I have said, is, I think, quite unanswerable.\nIn the result, the appeal should be allowed, and the petition dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Lamont and Cannon JJ. was delivered by\nLamont, J.\u2014In this case, as appears from the documents filed, there were issued by the Crown between September 1, 1888, and February 1, 1890, the patents for a number of fractional sections of land in township 17, ranges 10 and 11, W. 3, in the North West Territories. Some of these were issued to the Canadian Agricultural Coal & Colonization Company, and some to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, both of whom were the suppliants\u2019 predecessors in title. The following facts set out in the appellant's factum are not disputed:\u2014\n\"The grants so conveyed comprised, in all, 3,033.55 acres, for which the patentees paid $1.50 per acre.\n\" At the time of the issue of the patents the fractional sections in question abutted on the waters of Rush Lake. At that time the only survey of lands in the vicinity of Rush Lake was the survey of 1883. That survey was a survey of land not covered by water. Rush Lake itself was not then surveyed, nor was it or its bed surveyed until 1912.\n\" The patents above\u2022mentioned did not refer to the survey of 1883, nor did they make any reference to Rush Lake. The descriptions of the fractional sections covered by the patents are all in the following form:\u2014\n\"'All that parcel or tract of land, situate, lying and being in the 17th township, in the 11th range, west of the third meridian, in the Provisional District of Assiniboia, in the North West Territories of the Dominion of Canada, and being composed of the whole (fractional) of section 12 of the said township, containing by admeasurement 127 acres, more or less.'\n\" The survey of 1883 shewed the water's edge of Rush Lake as a meandered line, and the area of the various fractional sections bordering on the lake was shewn on the map on each fractional section.\n\" In 1903-4, for the purpose of straightening its main line, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company built a drain to lower the water in Rush Lake. This drain was constructed southeasterly from Rush Lake to Reed Lake, and the waters of Rush Lake were drained into Reed Lake thereby, and the level of the water in Rush Lake was lowered at least three feet. The effect of this was to make bare and dry, or, practically dry, a large extent of land, formerly part of the bed of Rush Lake, and lying between the meandered line on the map indicating the water's edge of Rush Lake as it was at the time of the survey of 1883, and as it was when the patents above mentioned were issued, and the new water's edge of Rush Lake created by the lowering of the waters thereof.\n\" The suppliants acquired their title to the fractional sections in question in 1909\u2014six years after the lowering of the waters of Rush Lake.\" The claim of the suppliants is that upon the true construction of the original patents they, being successors title to the patentees and riparian owners, are entitled to all the land in front of their fractional sections to the centre of Rush Lake, or, in any event, to the remainder of the fractional sections which have become dry owing to the recession of the waters of the lake. The claim of the Crown is that the area conveyed by each grant is confined strictly to the acreage mentioned in the description thereof.\nThe matter was tried before the learned President of the Exchequer Court (1), who found that the suppliants were riparian owners, and, following the rule of construction, well established in English law, that where in a conveyance of land the description shews that the land granted extends to the bank of a non-navigable stream, the conveyance is to be construed as a grant ad medium filum aquae, he held the suppliants to be entitled to the land in front of their fractional sections extending to the centre of the lake. From that judgment this appeal is brought.\nBy s. 11 of the North-West Territories Act, R.S.C., 1886, c. 50, the Parliament of Canada enacted as follows:\u2014\nSubject to the provisions of this Act, the laws of England relating to civil and criminal matters, as the same existed on the fifteenth day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy, shall be in force in the Territories, in so far as the same are applicable to the Territories, and in so far as the same have not been, or are not hereafter repealed, altered, varied, modified, or affected by any Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom applicable to the Territories, or of the Parliament of Canada, or by any ordinance of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\nAt that date the ad medium filum presumption or rule of construction formed part of the law of England. It, therefore, applied to the construction of grants or other conveyances of land in the North-West Territories unless[20] it was not applicable to the conditions existing in the Territories, and, therefore, not introduced therein, or (2) it was otherwise excluded.\nNow it has long been settled law in England that the prima facie application of the rule would be rebutted if there was anything in the language of the conveyance indicating an intention to exclude it or anything in the subject matter or the surrounding circumstances from which such an intention might reasonably be inferred. Dwyer v. Rich[21]; City of London Tax Commissioners v. Central London Railway Company[22]; Maclaren v. Attorney-General for Quebec[23]. Likewise the rule would be excluded if the statute law of the Dominion applicable to the Territories satisfactorily disclosed a legislative intention inconsistent with its application to conveyances of territorial lands.\nWhether the conditions prevailing in the Territories when English law was declared to be in force therein were so different from those prevailing in England that we would be justified in holding the rule entirely excluded on that ground, may, in my opinion, well be doubted. At any rate a consideration of that point will be unnecessary in the present case if the statute law discloses an intention on the part of the Legislature, or the patents, or the circumstances under which they were issued, disclose an intention on the part of the parties thereto, to exclude the rule. Our first inquiry, therefore, will be whether the legislation of the Parliament of Canada, passed prior to the issue of the patents in question herein, indicates any legislative intention as to the application of the rule.\nAt the outset it may be noted that, after the surrender of Rupert\u2019s Land and the North-West Territories to Canada by the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company in 1869, the title, to all public lands therein was in the Crown in right of the Dominion, and, therefore, subject to the jurisdiction of Parliament. The first legislation dealing with these lands is to be found in chapter 23 of the Statutes of Canada passed in 1872, and cited as the Dominion Lands Act. This Act, with certain amendments, was re-enacted as chapter 31 of the Statutes of 1879, and carried forward into the Revised Statutes of 1886, as chapter 54. The sections of the Act referred to below are taken from the Revised Statutes, 1886, but they are almost identical with the corresponding sections of the Act of 1872.\nS. 3 of the Act, in force when the grants herein were issued, reads as follows:\n3. Except as provided by any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, this Act applies exclusively to the public lands included in Manitoba and the several territories of Canada. Then, under the heading of \u201cSurveys\u201d we have s. 8, which reads:\u2014\n8. The Dominion lands shall be laid off in quadrilateral townships, each containing thirty-six sections of as nearly one mile square as the convergence of meridians permits, with such road allowances between sections, and of such width, as the Governor in Council prescribes.\nSubs. 2 provides that the sections shall be bounded and numbered as shewn by the diagram therein inserted. The diagram shews that the boundary lines run north and south and east and west at right angles, each line presumably a mile long and the whole forming a square. Provision is made in the Act for the establishing of various base lines beginning with the International boundary, and also for correction lines.\nS. 14 states that each section shall be divided into quarter sections of 160 acres more or less, subject to the provisions thereinafter made in the Act.\nThe Act also provides that before any given portion of the country is subdivided into townships and sections it shall be laid out into blocks of four townships each, by projecting the base and correction lines and east and west meridian boundaries of each block, and that on such lines, at the time of the survey, all township, section and quarter-section corners shall be marked, and such corners shall govern, respectively, in the subsequent subdivision of the block.\nThen, by sections 129 and 130, it is provided that all boundary lines of townships, and all section lines and governing points as defined by mounds, posts or monuments, erected, placed or planted at the angles of any township, section or other legal subdivision under the authority of this Act or of the Governor in Council \u201cshall be the true and unalterable boundaries\u201d of such township, section or legal subdivision respectively, and that such section or subdivision shall consist of the whole width included between the several mounds, posts or monuments erected at the several angles thereof, and no more or less.\nS. 29 reads as follows:\u2014\n29. Dominion lands, as the surveys thereof are duly made and confirmed, shall, except as otherwise hereinafter provided, be open for purchase, at such prices, and on such terms and conditions as are fixed, from time to time, by the Governor in Council; but no purchase shall be permitted at a less price than one dollar per acre. 2. Except in special cases in which the Governor in Council otherwise orders, no sale to one person shall exceed a section, or six hundred and forty acres.\n* * * *\nS. 32 provides that every person who is the head of a family and every male who attains the age of eighteen years shall be entitled to obtain homestead entry for any quantity of land not exceeding a quarter section. In the Act of 1872 his right is expressed to be for \u201cone hundred and sixty acres, or a less quantity\u201d.\nIn addition, there was in force at the same time the Territories Real Property Act (ch. 51 of R.S.C., 1886), in which Parliament had adopted for the Territories the Torrens System of land registration and transfer by which the title of an owner was registered under the Act and a transfer of land could be made by a conveyance in Form G, in which form the land to be conveyed is described by section, township, range and meridian, according to the description given in the survey provided for by the Dominion Lands Act. It will be noted, however, that no provision was made for the registration of property or property rights to which a riparian owner would be entitled in the bed of a non-navigable stream or lake by virtue of the ad medium filum rule if the same were applicable to conveyances of land in the North West Territories.\nAlthough the provisions relating to the survey and the registration of titles indicate a legislative intention with regard to the manner in which the land policy of Parliament was to be worked out, it is more particularly to the provisions enacted for the disposal of the public lands that we must look for any legislative intention as to the application of the ad medium filum rule to grants of such land. Is a legislative intention to restrict to one hundred and sixty acres the quantity of land which a homesteader may acquire under his homestead entry, consistent with an intention that, should one of the boundary lines of his quarter section coincide with the bank of a non-navigable stream or lake, he would be entitled to claim ownership of the bed of the stream or lake in front of his quarter to the centre thereof? In my opinion it is not. If the rule were applied in such a case it would enable the homesteader to acquire an acreage in excess of that which he could lawfully obtain under the Act. Then take the case of a purchaser under s. 29, above quoted. Under that section no person can purchase Dominion lands until the lands have been surveyed and the survey confirmed. If he does purchase he must pay the price fixed by the Governor in Council. His purchase is also restricted to six hundred and forty acres. Being presumed to know the law the purchaser must be held to have been aware of these restrictions. He must be held to have known that no official could sell him any unsurveyed land or any quantity of surveyed land in excess of the amount allowed by the statute, and also that he must pay for every acre purchased. Charged with this knowledge I fail to see how any riparian purchaser under this section can be heard to say that he is entitled, by reason of the application of the rule, to any acreage for which he did not pay and which he knew could not lawfully be sold to him. As it was chiefly by homestead entry, and purchase under s. 29, that Parliament made provision for the disposal of the Crown lands in the North West Territories, the legislative intention, as disclosed in the provisions for disposal by these methods, would apply to the greater portion of the territorial lands. Parliament, it is true, in special cases granted territorial lands as a subsidy to assist in the construction of railways, but these, while not inconsiderable, do not affect the legislative intention as disclosed in the statute.\nOther provisions indicate the same legislative intention, for example, the provisions under which certain lands were reserved for the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company. The company acquired its right to these lands under the Deed of Surrender by which Prince Rupert\u2019s Land and the North West Territories became part of the Dominion of Canada. The sections reserved and to which the company obtained title, gave it exactly the quantity of land which, in the deed, it was agreed that the company should have. That quantity could not afterwards be increased by the application of the rule without obligating the Crown to grant to the company a greater acreage than that specified in the deed.\nIn view of these statutory provisions I incline to the view that Parliament, by adopting a policy which, in so many of its operations was inconsistent with the existence of the rule, indicated a legislative intention that it was not to be applied in construing conveyances of Territorial lands. It is not, however, necessary in the present case to express a final opinion upon that general question, as, in my view, the patents we have to deal with and the agreements under which the lands therein set out were acquired by the suppliants\u2019 predecessors in title respectively, justify the inference that neither the Crown nor the grantees intended the rule should be applicable but that these fractional sections should be granted and accepted at the acreage set out in the patents. I therefore leave the general question open for further argument and consideration.\nThe rights of the suppliants\u2019 predecessors in title, The Canadian Agricultural Coal & Colonization Company, to the land for which they obtained patents and which the suppliants now claim constituted it a riparian owner, were acquired under an agreement, dated 11th day of February, 1887, entered into pursuant to an order in council and made between the Government of Canada and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and Sir John Lister Kaye. In this agreement the Government agreed to sell to Sir John Lister Kaye 50,000 acres of land; 5,000 acres at each of ten points, of which Rush Lake was one, for a consideration of $1.50 per acre, and the performance of certain stipulations as to cultivation. The agreement also provided for the purchase by Sir John Lister Kaye of a similar quantity of land at each of the points from the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\nOn January 3, 1889, an order in council was passed which, after reciting that, according to representations made by Sir John Lister Kaye, over $700,000 had been spent by the Colonization Company on the farms purchased from the Government and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, recommended that an immediate sale of the 50,000 acres be made to the company at a price of not less than $1.50 per acre. That this sale was carried out appears from the certificate of the Deputy Registrar of Dominion Lands\u2019 Patents, which reads as follows:\u2014\nThe Canadian Agricultural Coal and Colonization Company, Limited, which Company assumed the liabilities of Sir John Lister Kaye as set out in the Agreement of the 11th February, 1887, was permitted to purchase the 50,000 acres of land mentioned in the said Agreement by Order in Council dated the 3rd January, 1889 (P.C. 2757), at a price not less than $1.50 per acre, as originally agreed upon. Lands comprising a total area of 50,302 acres were duly paid for, and letters patent therefor in the name of the said Company were issued in the year 1889. All sec- tions or fractional sections patented were lands shown to be not covered with water on the respective township plans in use at the time of the grants. The areas of dry land patented to the said Company in the five fractional sections bordering on Rush Lake in township 17, ranges 10 and 11, west of the 3rd meridian, aggregating 1,805.80 acres, are included in the total area of 50,302 acres referred to.\nWe have, therefore, the following circumstances from which to draw an inference as to the company\u2019s intention in reference to the application of the rule: The agreement was for 50,000 acres (allowed at 50,302 acres) to be paid for at $1.50 per acre. That acreage the company selected and paid for and received the patents thereof. As part of that acreage the company accepted the fractional even numbered sections in question herein, but it accepted them only at the acreage set out in the patents. It knew that no one, either under the statute or the order in council, had any right to convey to it an acreage in excess of that which it had received. That acreage was all it paid for and all it intended to pay for. Under these circumstances the only reasonable inference to be drawn, in my opinion, is that the company never intended that the ad medium filum rule should apply so as to give it an acreage in excess of that agreed upon and paid for.\nThe suppliants\u2019 other predecessor in title was the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. The rights of that company to the lands of which the suppliants are now the owners were presumably (for it is not clearly established) acquired under the special contract bearing date the 21st day of October, 1880, which forms the schedule to ch. 1 of the Statutes of Canada, 1881. In that contract the Government agreed to grant to the company a subsidy of 25,000,000 acres of land in consideration of the completion, equipment, maintenance and operation of the railway, as set out in the contract. The railway was completed and operated; the 25,000,000 acres were earned and I think we may assume that the company received the patents thereof, including the fractional uneven numbered sections bordering on Rush Lake. The contract between the railway company and the Government, however, contained a clause which, in my opinion, excludes the application of the rule to these patents. It reads as follows:\u2014\n11. The grant of land hereby agreed to be made to the Company, shall be so made in alternate sections of 640 acres each, extending back 24 miles deep, on each side of the railway, from Winnipeg to Jasper House, in so far as such lands shall be vested in the Government,\u2014the Company receiving the sections bearing uneven numbers. But should any of such sections consist in a material degree of land not fairly fit for settlement, the Company shall not be obliged to receive them as part of such grant; and the deficiency thereby caused and any further deficiency which may arise from the insufficient quantity of land along the said portion of railway, to complete the said 25,000,000 acres, or from the prevalence of lakes and water stretches in the sections granted (which lakes and water stretches shall not be computed in the acreage of such sections), shall be made up from other portions in the tract known as the fertile belt * * *\nUnder this clause the company was to get the sections bearing uneven numbers. If any uneven numbered section was not fairly fit for settlement the company was not obliged to receive it as part of its subsidy, but, if it did receive it, it obtained the whole of the section although the land under water was not taken into account in computing their 25,000,000 acres. This seems to follow from the right given to the company to make up from other portions of the fertile belt any deficiency which might arise \u201cfrom the prevalence of lakes and water stretches in the sections granted\u201d.\nBeing entitled under their contract to the land under water in each uneven numbered section as well as the dry land, the question of the application of the rule to these patents does not arise, for the company cannot be said to have been riparian owners with reference to the lands in the sections which were under water. The bed of the lake to the boundaries of each section was the company\u2019s to take. Title to that bed it did not take. Under these circumstances the intention both of the Crown and of the company must be held to have been not only that the ad medium filum rule should not apply but that the patents to these fractional sections should be granted and accepted as covering only the acreage therein set out.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed with costs and the petition dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs; and petition dismissed with costs\nSolicitor for the appellant: R.
