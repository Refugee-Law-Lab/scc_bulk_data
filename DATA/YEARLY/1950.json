The following question referred by the Governor General in Council under s. 55 of The Supreme Court Act to this Court: \"Are the Wartime Leasehold Regulations ultra vires either in whole or in part and if so in what particulars and to what extent?\"\u2014was answered in the negative.\nHeld, that Parliament, under powers implied in the Constitution may,. for the peace, order and good government of Canada as a whole, in \" time of national emergency, assume jurisdiction over property and civil rights which under normal conditions are matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures.\nWhen Parliament has enacted legislation declaring that a national emergency continues to exist and that it is necessary that certain regulations be continued in force temporarily in order to ensure an orderly transition from war to peace, unless the contrary is very clear, which in this case it was not, there is nothing to justify a contrary finding by the Court.\nFort Frances Pulp & Power Co. v.

The Chief Justice: The question referred by the Governor in Council to the Court is:\u2014\nAre The Wartime Leasehold Regulations ultra vires either in whole or in part and, if so, in what particulars or to what extent?\nAfter having heard arguments on behalf of the Attorney- General of Canada, the Attorney-General of Ontario, the Attorney-General of Quebec, The Tenants within Canada, The Property Owners' Association, The Dominion Command of the British Empire Service League and The Canadian Congress of Labour, I am of opinion that the question should be answered in the negative.\nThese references, under Section 55 of The Supreme Court Act, merely call for the opinion of the Court on the questions of law or fact submitted by the Governor in Council and the answers given by the Court are only opinions. It has invariably been declared that they are not judgments either binding on the government, on parliament, on individuals, and even on the Court itself, although, of course, this should be qualified by saying that, in a contested case where the same questions would arise, they would no doubt be followed. But precisely on account of their character the opinions are supposed to be given on the material which appears in the Order of Reference and the Court is not expected to look to outside evidence. It is clear that the Court may take into consideration any fact which is of common, or public, knowledge, or of which it could ordinarily take judicial notice. Otherwise, however, excepting very exceptional cases, which it would be quite impossible to enumerate and in respect of which the present Reference is not concerned, the Court is limited to the statements of fact contained in the Order of Reference. I would venture to say that this has been the constant practice of this Court on References submitted under Section 55 of The Supreme Court Act.\nAs to the first proposition, it was pointed out by the Lord Chancellor, Earl Loreburn, in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada 1, that the opinions provoked by such questions \"are only advisory and would have no more effect than the opinions of the law officers\", to which Duff J. (as he then was) in Reference re Waters and Water-Powers 2, after having quoted the statement of Earl Loreburn, observed that \"when a con- crete case is presented for the practical application of the principles discussed, it may be found necessary, under the light derived from a survey of the facts, to modify the statement of such views as are herein expressed\". As a matter of fact, in the Water-Powers Reference, following an objection raised by Mr. Tilley, K.C., representing the Attorney-General for Ontario, to certain material which had been included in the appendix of the factum of the Attorney-General for Canada, the Court ordered two hundred and forty pages stricken from the appendix and made the following observation:\u2014\nIt must be obvious that any statements of facts, upon which answers to the questions must be based, should form part of the Case submitted, and it would be highly inconvenient and most dangerous to receive documents such as these in question as part of the Case, unless with the full consent and concurrence of all parties.\nIn that case, Smith J., concurring with Duff J., but writing separately, at p. 233 of the Report, thought that he would explain certain references made in his judgment to a situation which did not appear in the record by saying:\u2014\nWe might, perhaps, take judicial notice of some of the facts, and might gather others from statutory enactments * * * I have gone beyond the record, not to obtain material as a basis for answering the questions, but merely to emphasize what my brother Duff has said as to the impracticability of giving full and definite answers to all the questions that would have general application, regardless of particular circumstances capable of proof but not established or admitted in the record.\nNo doubt anybody attacking parliament's legislation as colourable would have to introduce evidence of certain facts to support the contention, for it can hardly be expected that the Order of Reference would contain material of a nature to induce the Court to conclude as to the colourability of the legislation. It may be that it would be so apparent that the Court could come to that conclusion without extraneous evidence, and an example of that situation might be found In the Matter of a reference as to the validity of Section 16 of The Special War Revenue Act 3, where Sir Lyman Duff C.J., delivering the judgment of the Court, found, at p. 434, that the section was ultra vires in its entirety on the ground that, under the guise of legislation affecting British and Foreign Companies and extra Canadian exchanges, the enactments were really adopted in relation to the business of insurance within the provinces and could not be upheld as alien legislation in the proper sense.\nBut it would seem that the constitutionality of legislation disputed on the ground of colourability should really be brought before the Courts not on a Reference, but in an ordinary case. It is no doubt in that sense that we must understand the dictum of Lord Maugham in Attorney-General for Alberta v. Attorney-General for Canada 4:\u2014\nThe next step in a case of difficulty will be to examine the effect of the legislation; Union Colliery Co. of British Columbia, Ld. v. Bryden 5. For that purpose the Court must take into account any public general knowledge of which the Court would take judicial notice, and may in a proper case require to be informed by evidence as to what the effect of the legislation will be. Clearly, the Acts passed by the Provincial Legislature may be considered, for it is often impossible to determine the effect of the Act under examination without taking into account any other Act operating, or intended to operate, or recently operating in the Province.\nAnd again at p. 131:\u2014\nMatters of which the Court would take judicial notice must be borne in mind, and other evidence in a case which calls for it.\nIn these quotations the words used by the noble Lord are \"in a proper case\" and \"in a case which calls for it\". He does not say \"on a Reference\", and I cannot see how two obiter dicta of that character can be invoked as meaning that outside evidence may be called on a Reference.\nThe Fort Frances Pulp & Power Co. Ltd. v. Manitoba Free Press Co. Ltd. et al 6, was such an ordinary case between two private litigants, and in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in that case Viscount Haldane, at p. 706, expressed the view:\u2014\nNo authority other than the central Government is in a position to deal with a problem which is essentially one of statesmanship. It may be that it has become clear that the crisis which arose is wholly at an end and that there is no justification for the continued exercise of an exceptional interference which becomes ultra vires when it is no longer called for. In such a case the law as laid down for distribution of powers in the ruling instrument would have to be invoked. But very clear evidence that the crisis had wholly passed away would be required to justify the judiciary, even when the question raised was one of ultra vires which it had to decide, in overruling the decision of the Government that exceptional measures were still requisite. In saying what is almost obvious, their Lordships observe themselves to be in accord with the view taken under analogous circumstances by the Supreme Court of the United States, and expressed in such decisions as that in October, 1919, in Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries Co. 7.\nSome allusion was made to the same point In the Matter of a Reference as to the jurisdiction of Parliament to regulate and control radio communication 8. A mere glance at the Order-in-Council reproduced at that and the following pages is sufficient to show to what extent the facts in that matter were there stated. It is to be noted that the opinion of Newcombe J., p. 548, starts by saying:\nMy trouble with this case is to know the facts. Although the narrative of the order of reference and the printed statement of principles were not at the hearing seriously disputed, one is apt to suspect that the knowledge of the art of radio, which we have derived from the submissions and what was said in the course of argument, is still incomplete and, perhaps, in some particulars, not free from error; that some accepted theories are still experimental or tentative, and that there may be possibilities of development and use, not only in the Dominion but also in a provincial field, which have not yet been fully ascertained or tested.\nIt is obvious that if Newcombe J., whose experience in these matters cannot be disputed, had thought that he was entitled to hear outside evidence on a Reference, he would have availed himself of the opportunity. It is true that in that Reference an article compiled by J. W. Bain, a radio engineer of the Marine Department, was printed in the case, but, as stated by Smith J. at p. 569:\u2014\nThis document is inserted for the convenience of the court, and it is stated that its accuracy may be verified by reference to the various standard text-books on the subject. Its general accuracy was, I think, not controverted, and I therefore resort to this document for a brief general description of how radio communication is effected.\nRadio communication was, of course, of a highly technical nature and it was felt necessary that the Court should at least be informed of how it worked.\nIn the Matter of a Reference as to whether the term \"Indians\" in Head 24 of Section 91 of The British North. America Act, 1867, includes Eskimo Inhabitants of the Province of Quebec 9, in the order fixing the date for hearing Sir Lyman Duff, C.J., appointed the Registrar of the Court to hear and take all evidence, oral and documentary, which the Attorney-General of Canada or any other interested parties desired to submit, or adduce, in relation to the question referred to the Court. He ordered further that all the evidence so adduced and submitted on behalf of each of the interested parties be included quantum valeat and subject to all just exceptions in the case, and printed in such groups and order as the interested parties might agree upon, subject to the approval of the Registrar. It is to be noted that all interested parties, including, of course, the Attorney-General of Canada, were given the opportunity to submit relevant evidence and particularly that such evidence was incorporated in and formed part of the case.\nI must say, therefore, that, for the purpose of my answer, I am limiting myself strictly to the situation disclosed in the Order of Reference and the different declarations which appear in the successive Acts adopted by Parliament. Thus limiting my consideration of the Reference and the extent of my answer, I have very few remarks to make.\nThere is no doubt that under normal conditions the subject matter of rents belongs to the provincial jurisdiction under the Head of Property and Civil Rights, in Section 92 of The British North America Act. There is equally no doubt that under abnormal conditions, such as the existence of war, parliament may competently assume jurisdiction over rents. The fact is that, as a consequence of the last war, 1939-1945, parliament has taken over the control of rents. The Fort Frances case supra is authority for the proposition that, notwithstanding the cessation of hostilities, parliament is empowered to continue the control of rents for the purpose of concluding matters then pending, and of its discontinuance in an orderly manner, as the emergency permits, of measures adopted during and by reason of the emergency. It follows from the different Orders-in-Council and Acts of Parliament, recited in the Order of Reference, that the exceptional conditions brought about by war, which made The Wartime Leasehold Regulations necessary, are still continuing, that the orderly transition from war to peace has not yet been completed, and that, in such circumstances, parliament is entitled and empowered to maintain such control as it finds necessary to ensure the orderly transition from war to peace. The judgments of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Fort Frances Case supra and in Cooperative Committee on Japanese Canadians v. Attorney-General for Canada 10, are conclusive on this point.\nIn the Reference as to the Validity of the Regulations in relation to Chemicals 11, Sir Lyman Duff, C.J., stated at p. 12:\u2014\nAs in respect of any other measure which the Executive Government may be called upon to consider, the duty rests upon it to decide, whether, in the conditions confronting it, it deems it necessary or advisable for the safety of the state to appoint such subordinate agencies and to determine what their powers shall be.\nThere is always, of course, some risk of abuse when wide powers are committed in general terms to any body of men. Under the War Measures Act the final responsibility for the acts of the Executive rests upon Parliament. Parliament abandons none of its powers, none of its control over the Executive, legal or constitutional.\nThe enactment is, of course, of the highest political nature. It is the attribution to the Executive Government of powers legislative in their character, described in terms implying nothing less than a plenary discretion, for securing the safety of the country in time of war. Subject only to the fundamental conditions explained above, (and the specific provisions enumerated), when Regulations have been passed by the Governor General in Council in professed fulfilment of his statutory duty, I cannot agree that it is competent to any court to canvass\" the considerations which have, or may have, led him to deem such Regulations necessary or advisable for the transcendent objects set forth. The authority and the duty of passing on that question are committed to those who are responsible for the security of the country\u2014the Executive Government itself, under, I repeat, its responsibility to Parliament. The words are too plain for dispute: the measures authorized are such as the Governor General in Council (not the courts) deems necessary or advisable.\nIn this instance, Parliament has decided that The Wartime Leasehold Regulations should be kept in force to a limited extent and to that extent, where necessary or advisable, to ensure an orderly transition from war to peace; and that, if they were abandoned abruptly and suddenly, unnecessary disruption would result.\nThere is nothing in the facts in the Order of Reference which would justify this Court in deciding otherwise and thus supersede the opinion of Parliament; and, in the circumstances, this Court may not doubt that Parliament may competently maintain the Regulations it has adopted to meet the emergency and its continuance. Therefore, The Wartime Leasehold Regulations are not ultra vires either in whole or in part. Kerwin J.:\u2014The question referred by the Governor in Council to the Court for hearing and consideration is:\u2014\nAre The Wartime Leasehold Regulations ultra vires either in whole or in part and, if so, in what particulars or to what extent?\nThe Regulations were originally made by order of the Governor in Council P.C. 2029 of November 21, 1941, under the War Measures Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 206, and a number of amendments to the Regulations were also made by Orders in Council under the same Act, which continued in force until December 31, 1945. By The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945 (chapter 25 of the Statutes of 1945), which came into force on and after January 1, 1946, it was provided that \"on and after that date the war against Germany and Japan shall for the purpose of the War Measures Act be deemed no longer to exist.\" The effect of this provision was to terminate the operation of the War Measures Act.\nHowever, the 1945 statute also provided that the Governor in Council might order that the orders and regulations lawfully made under the War Measures Act or pursuant to authority granted under that Act, in force immediately before the Act of 1945 came into force should, while the latter Act was in force, continue in full force and effect, subject to amendment or revocation under the latter Act. Accordingly, by P.C. 7414, of December 28, 1945, the Governor in Council so provided. The effect of this Order in Council was to continue the Regulations in force.\nThe Act of 1945 provided that it should expire on December 31, 1946, if Parliament met during November or December, 1946, but, if Parliament did not so meet, that it should expire on the fifteenth day after Parliament first met during the year 1947. It was also provided that if at any time while the Act was in force, addresses were presented to the Governor General by the Senate and House of Commons, praying that it should be continued in force for a further period, not in any case exceeding one year from the time at which it would ordinarily expire, and the Governor in Council so ordered, the Act should continue in force for the further period. What has been stated in the two preceding sentences is the substance of section 6 of the Act of 1945. This section 6 was repealed and a new one enacted by chapter 60 of the 1945 Statutes and by virtue thereof and of Order in Council P.C. 1112 of March 25, 1947, made pursuant to addresses to the Governor General by the Senate and House of Commons, the Act of 1945 was continued in force until May 15, 1947.\nThe Continuation of Transitional Measures Act, 1947, being chapter 16 of the Statutes of that year, came into force immediately on the expiry of the 1945 Act. The recital in the 1947 statute reads as follows:\u2014\nWhereas Parliament, in view of the continuation of the national emergency arising out of the war, by The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, conferred upon the Governor in Council certain transitional powers, pursuant to which the Governor in Council has continued in force certain orders and regulations made under the War Measures Act and has made other orders and regulations; And whereas the national emergency arising out of the war, in certain aspects, has continued since the unconditional surrender of Germany and Japan and is still continuing; And whereas provision is made for the expiry of The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1946; And whereas it is necessary by reason of the existing national emergency that certain orders and regulations of the Governor in Council made under the War Measures Act and The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, be continued in force temporarily notwithstanding the expiry of The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, in order to ensure an orderly transition from war to peace:\nThe statute provides that the orders and regulations of the Governor in Council specified in the Schedule shall, notwithstanding the expiry of the 1945 Act, continue and be in force while the 1947 statute is in force, subject to the revocation by the Governor in Council in whole or in part of any such order or regulation. The Wartime Leasehold Regulations, that is, P.C. 2029 of 1941 and all the orders in council amending it, are listed in the schedule.\nThe Continuation of Transitional Measures Act, 1947, also provided in section 7 that it should expire on December 31, 1947, if Parliament met during November or December, 1947, but if Parliament did not so meet it should expire on the sixtieth day after Parliament first met during 1948 or on March 31, 1948, whichever date was earlier. If, however, while the Act was in force addresses were presented to the Governor General by the Senate and House of Commons praying that the Act should be continued in force for a further period not in any case exceeding one year from the time it would otherwise expire and the Governor in Council so ordered, the Act should continue in force for that further period. The Act was continued in force by Order in Council P.C. 5304 of December 13, 1947, made pursuant to a joint address. It has subsequently been continued in force by chapter 5 of the Statutes of Canada, 1948, and chapter 3 of the Statutes of Canada 1949 (Vol. 1). These statutes amended section 7 of the Act to extend its duration and that section at present reads as follows:\u2014\n7. Subject as hereinafter provided, this Act shall expire on the sixtieth day after Parliament first meets during the year one thousand nine hundred and fifty or on the thirty-first day of March, one thousand nine hundred and fifty, whichever date is the earlier; Provided that, if at any time while this Act is in force, Addresses are presented to the Governor General by the Senate and House of Commons, respectively, praying that this Act should be continued in force for a further period, not in any case exceeding one year, from the time at which it would otherwise expire and the Governor in Council so orders, this Act shall continue in force for that further period.\nChapter 3, Statutes of 1949, also restricted the authority of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board to the control of goods and services under control at the time of the enactment of that statute. The provisions of section 7 of the 1949 Act, set forth above, show when the regulations, if varied, may cease to operate.\nIt is apparent from the documents of which we are entitled to take judicial knowledge that the leasehold regulations were originally part only of various controls of enterprise and services, etc., and that this control was loosened in various respects from time to time until it now appears that very few controls are being exercised. So far as the leasehold regulations are concerned, steps were taken from time to time to limit the interference with what would otherwise be the ordinary rights of landlords and tenants until, by Order 813 of the Wartime Prices Board, dated December 15, 1949, as amended by Order 818, provision was made for increases in the maximum rental that might be charged for self-contained dwellings and lodgings and making provision for the termination of leases in certain circumstances. Board Order 814 makes further provision for the securing of possession of premises by landlords.\nNotwithstanding the argument to the contrary, the answer to be given to the question submitted to the Court is indicated by the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Fort Frances Pulp and Power Co. v. Manitoba Free Press Co. 12. That, it should be noted, was a decision inter partes and not an answer to a question submitted by the Governor in Council. Where a war emergency has existed and Parliament has enacted legislation declaring that the national emergency arising out of war, in certain aspects, has continued and is continuing, the subject matter of the legislation must be left to Parliament if it decides that the interests of the Dominion are to be protected. \"No authority other than the central government is in a position to deal with the problem which is essentially one of statesmanship\"; the Fort Frances case at page 706. Only \"very clear evidence\" or \"clear and unmistakable evidence\" that the Government is in error in thinking that the matter is of inherent national concern would justify a Court in so deciding: idem p. 706: Cooperative Committee on Japanese Canadians 13, at pp. 101 and 108. These two decisions dispose of the matter, and the answer to the question must be in the negative.\nTaschereau J.:\u2014His Excellency the Governor in Council has referred to this Court the following question:\u2014\nAre The Wartime Leasehold Regulations ultra vires either in whole or in part and if so in what particulars or to what extent?\nThe War Measures Act (R.S.C. 1927, ch. 206) was brought into operation by a Proclamation dated September 1, 1939; and on September 11, 1940, by Order in Council P.C. 4616, The Wartime Prices and Trade Board Regulations, made under the War Measures Act, were extended to rentals and housing accommodation. In November, 1941, consolidated regulations respecting leasehold, and entitled The Wartime Leasehold Regulations were established, and on January 1, 1946, an Act of Parliament entitled The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act was enacted, and at the same time, all the Orders in Council respecting rentals, passed under the War Measures Act, were continued in force.\nThe preamble of this Statute recalls that during the national emergency that arose by reason of the war against Germany and Japan, measures have been adopted under the War Measures Act for the military requirements and the security of Canada and the maintenance of economic stability; it also stated that this national emergency has continued and is still continuing, and that it is essential in the national interest that certain transitional powers continue to be exercised by the Governor General in Council during the continuation of the exceptional conditions brought about by the war, but that it is preferable that such transitional powers be exercised under specific authority conferred by Parliament, instead of being exercised under the War Measures Act. The preamble further says that it is necessary that certain acts and things done and authorized, and certain orders and regulations made under the War Measures Act be continued in force, and that the Governor General in Council be authorized to do, and authorize such further acts and things, and make such further orders and regulations deemed advisable by reason of the emergency, and also for the purpose of discontinuance in an orderly manner, as the emergency permits, of measures adopted during and by reason of the emergency.\nSubsection 1 of section 2 of The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, sets out the powers of the Governor General in Council in part as follows:\u2014\n2. (1) The Governor in Council may do and authorize such acts and things, and make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he may, by reason of the continued existence of the national emergency arising out of the war against Germany and Japan, deem necessary or advisable for the purpose of\n(a) providing for and maintaining the armed forces of Canada during the occupation of enemy territory and demobilization and providing for the rehabilitation of members thereof,\n(b) facilitating the readjustment of industry and commerce to the requirements of the community in time of peace,\n(c) maintaining, controlling and regulating supplies and services, prices, transportation, use and occupation of property, rentals, employment, salaries and wages to ensure economic stability and an orderly transition to conditions of peace;\n(d) \u2026\n(e) continuing or discontinuing in an orderly manner, as the emergency permits, measures adopted during and by reason of the war.\nThis Act was continued in force until May 15, 1947, and on that date, an Act entitled The Continuation of Transitional Measures Act, 1947, came into force, and the preamble of this new Act recalls that in view of the continuation of the national emergency Parliament has in 1945, conferred upon the Governor General in Council certain transitional powers, that the Governor General in Council has continued in force certain orders and regulations made under the War Measures Act and has made other orders and regulations; it also states that the national emergency arising out of the war, in certain aspects, has continued since the unconditional surrender of Germany and Japan and is still continuing; that it is necessary by reason of this emergency, in order to ensure an orderly transition from war to peace, to enact The Continuation of Transitional Measures Act, so. that certain orders or regulations of the Governor General in Council be continued in force temporarily, notwithstanding the expiry of The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act.\nSection 2 of The Continuation of Transitional Measures Act, 1947, provides as follows:\u2014\n2. (1) Subject to section 4 of this Act the orders and regulations of the Governor in Council specified in the Schedule to this Act shall, notwithstanding the expiry of The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, continue and be in force while this Act is in force.\nIn the Schedule of this Act is Order in Council P.C. 9029, Wartime Leasehold Regulations, and by section 4 of the Act, the Governor in Council is authorized to revoke in whole or in part any order or regulation continued in force by or made under the Act. The Act has been continued from year to year and will expire on the 31st of March, 1950.\nIt has to be decided if the Wartime Leasehold Regulations made by Orders in Council are ultra vires either in whole or in part and if so in what particulars or to what extent.\nThe Attorney General of Canada, the Attorney General for Ontario, the Canadian Legion of the British Empire Service League, and the Canadian Congress of Labour, have submitted that these regulations are valid in toto, but the Attorney General for the Province of Quebec and the Canadian Federation of Property Owners Associations, on behalf of itself, its member associations and all the property owners of Canada, contend that they are ultra vires the powers of the Dominion. The submission of the Attorney General of Canada and of the others who have supported his views, is that those regulations were valid under the War Measures Act, as well as under The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, and that they were validly continued in force by The Continuation of Transitional Measures Act of 1947, (a) as legislation in relation to the emergency arising out of the war, and (b) as legislation providing for the withdrawal in an orderly way of measures adopted to meet the war emergency.\nIt is now settled law, and this question has now passed the stage of serious controversy, that regulations passed under the War Measures Act, in times of emergency arising out of the war, and continued in force under The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, are unchallengeable. Vide: Fort Frances Pulp & Power Co. v. Manitoba Free Press Co. 14; In re Gray 15; Reference re Chemicals 16; The Co-operative Committee on Japanese Canadians v. Attorney General of Canada 17.\nA short reference to some of these cases will conclusively show that certain matters that normally belong to the provincial domain, become of federal concern, when by reason of abnormal circumstances a national emergency arises, which in order to be adequately dealt with, requires the total efforts of the country as a whole.\nIn Fort Frances Pulp & Power Co. v. Manitoba Free Press 18, Viscount Haldane speaking for the Judicial Committee said at page 703:\u2014\nIt is clear that in normal circumstances the Dominion Parliament could not have so legislated as to set up the machinery of control over the paper manufacturers which is now in question. The recent decision of the Judicial Committee in the Board of Commerce Case 19, as well as earlier decisions, show that as the Dominion Parliament cannot ordinarily legislate so as to interfere with property and civil rights in the Provinces, it could not have done what the two statutes under consideration purport to do had the situation been normal. But it does not follow that in a very different case, such as that of sudden danger to social order arising from the outbreak of a great war, the Parliament of the Dominion cannot act under other powers which may well be implied in the constitution. The reasons given in the Board of Commerce Case recognize exceptional cases where such a power may be implied.\nIn the event of war, when the national life may require for its preservation the employment of very exceptional means, the provision of peace, order and good government for the country as a whole may involve effort on behalf of the whole nation, in which the interests of individuals may have to be subordinated to that of the community in a fashion which requires s. 91 to be interpreted as providing for such an emergency. The general control of property and civil rights for normal purposes remains with the Provincial Legislatures. But questions may arise by reason of the special circumstances of the national emergency which concern nothing short of the peace, order and good government of Canada as a whole.\nIn the Reference as to the Validity of the Regulations in relation to Chemicals 20, Sir Lyman Duff said:\u2014\nThe War Measures Act came before this Court for consideration in 1918 in re Gray 21, and a point of capital importance touching its effect was settled by the decision in that case. It was decided there that the authority vested in the Governor General in Council is legislative in its character and an order in council which had the effect of radically amending the Military Service Act, 1917, was held to be valid. The decision involved the principle, which must be taken in this Court to be settled, that an order in council in conformity with the conditions prescribed by, and the provisions of, the War Measures Act may have the effect of an Act of Parliament.\nNot only are the regulations made under the War Measures Act, valid, in case of emergency, but also must be held to be within the powers of the Central Government, regulations to avoid economic and other disturbances occasioned originally by the war. In the case cited supra, (Fort Frances Pulp & Power Co. v. Manitoba Free Press) it was held:\u2014\nHeld, accordingly, that the Canadian War Measures Act, 1914, and Orders in Council made thereunder during the war for controlling throughout Canada the supply of newsprint paper by manufacturers and its price, also a Dominion Act passed after the cessation of hostilities for continuing the control until the proclamation of peace, with power to conclude matters then pending, were intra vires.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division affirmed on a different ground.\nThe more recent case of Co-operative Committee on Japanese Canadians v. Attorney General for Canada 22 is very much to the point. In that case, this Court decided that three Orders in Council passed in 1945, after the cessation of hostilities, under the authority of the War Measures Act, and continued in force by Order in Council pursuant to section four of The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, authorizing the deportation of certain Japanese, were valid. Delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, which upheld this Court, Lord Wright said at page 101:\u2014\nOn certain general matters of principle there is not, since the decision in Fort Frances Pulp & Power Co. v. Manitoba Free Press Co. 23, any room for dispute. Under the British North America Act property and civil rights in the several Provinces are committed to the Provincial legislatures, but the Parliament of the Dominion in a sufficiently great emergency, such as that arising out of war, has power to deal adequately with that emergency for the safety of the Dominion as a whole.\nThese binding judicial pronouncements clearly hold that regulations made under the War Measures Act and under subsequent statutes, when there is still an emergency arising out of the war, must be held valid. This legislation may, of course, incidentally affect provincial rights, but as long as it is legislation directed to meet the continuing national emergency, it is not legislation in relation to provincial rights, but in \"pith and substance\", in relation to a matter upon which the Central authority may competently legislate. Attorney General for Ontario v. Reciprocal Insurers 24; Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General for Quebec et al. 25.\nUnder \"Property and Civil Rights\", rentals are normally of provincial concern, but as the result of an emergency, the existing provincial laws on the matter become inoperative. The rights of the provinces are not of course permanently suppressed, and their jurisdiction temporarily suspended during the federal invasion, flows afresh when the field is finally abandoned. It is only during the period of occupation that the provincial jurisdiction is overridden. This is the reason that may justify the Dominion Government to offer to some or to all of the provinces to legislate on rentals, and to exercise anew their constitutional rights.\nIn order however to vest in the Federal Parliament the necessary authority to deal with such matters, there must be an emergency. There is no doubt that such an emergency existed during the war, and that during that period, the jurisdiction of Parliament could not be impugned. But the time that an emergency lasts is not limited to the period of actual hostilities. War is the cause of many social and economic disturbances and its aftermath brings unstable conditions which are settled only after a period of necessary readjustment, during which the emergency may very well persist. As Viscount Haldane said in the Fort Frances case:\u2014\nAt what date did the disturbed state of Canada which the war had produced so entirely pass away that the legislative measures relied on in the present case became ultra vires? The preambles of The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, and of The Continuation of Transitional Measures Act, 1947, and the Order in Council submitting this Reference to this Court, clearly declare that the emergency still exists as a result of the war, and that by reason of that emergency and in order to decontrol in an orderly manner, it is imperative that the Governor General in Council be authorized to enact the necessary regulations.\nOf course, these statements are not conclusive and do not close the door to all judicial investigations, but it is only with great caution that the courts will intervene and disregard these declarations of Parliament and of the Governor General in Council. As Viscount Haldane said in the Fort Frances case:\u2014\nIn such a case the law as laid down for distribution of powers in the ruling instrument would have to be invoked. But very clear evidence that the crisis had wholly passed away would be required to justify the judiciary, even when the question raised was one of ultra vires which it had to decide, in overruling the decision of the Government that exceptional measures were still requisite.\nAnd further, also at page 707:\u2014\nIt is enough to say that there is no clear and unmistakable evidence that the Government was in error in thinking that the necessity was still in existence at the dates on which the action in question was taken by the Paper Control Tribunal.\nIn the Co-operative Committee on Japanese Canadians v. Attorney General for Canada 26, at page 101, Lord Wright expressed his views as follows:\u2014\nThe interests of the Dominion are to be protected and it rests with the Parliament of the Dominion to protect them. What those interests are the Parliament of the Dominion must be left with considerable freedom to judge. Again, if it be clear that an emergency has not arisen, or no longer exists, there can be no justification for the exercise or continued exercise of the exceptional powers. The rule of law as to the distribution of powers between the Parliaments of the Dominion and the Parliaments of the Provinces comes into play. But very clear evidence that an emergency has not arisen, or that the emergency no longer exists, is required to justify the judiciary, even though the question is one of ultra vires, in overruling the decision of the Parliament of the Dominion that exceptional measures were required or were still required. To this may be added as a collorary that it is not pertinent to the judiciary to consider the wisdom or the propriety of the particular policy which is embodied in the emergency legislation. Determination of the policy to be followed is exclusively a matter for the Parliament of the Dominion and those to whom it has delegated its powers. In the present instance, no evidence of any kind has been submitted to show that the emergency has disappeared and that normal conditions are now prevailing. On the contrary, common knowledge, to which it is surely permissible to appeal in a case of this kind, and the very valuable exhibits in the record which I have usefully con-suited, to test the accuracy of the statements, lead me to the irresistible conclusion that an emergency still exists as an aftermath of the war. Vide: The Attorney General for Ontario v. Reciprocal Insurers, 27; Attorney General for Alberta v. Attorney General for Canada, 28; Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board v. Turners Dairy Ltd. 29.\nThe case of Russell v. The Queen 30 has been referred to during the argument. This case which is very frequently cited has no application. Moreover, it has not the meaning that has been attributed to it, as a result of the dictum of Viscount Haldane in Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider 31. In Attorney General for Canada v. Canada Temperance Federation 32, Viscount Simon has definitely settled the matter and removed all possible doubts. Speaking for the Judicial Committee, he held that the Scott Act was a permanent law and not a law, the validity of which was justified by an emergency. It is not the existence of abnormal and transitory conditions that justified its validity.\nThe present case must also be distinguished from the Reference submitted to this Court as to the validity of the Dairy Industry Act. The Margarine Case, 33. In that case, amongst other submissions, it was contended that there was an emergency that justified the Parliament of Canada under the \"Peace, Order and good Government\" clause of section 91 of the B.N.A. Act to enact the legislation, but this Court held that an emergency did not exist, particularly in view of the allegation in the Order in Council, that margarine was not obnoxious to health, and that therefore the matter was of provincial concern.\nIt follows that if there is unmistakable evidence to make it clear that there is no emergency, the courts are duty bound to intervene. Otherwise, we would reach a con- clusion that is not justified by the B.N.A. Act. Under the guise of \"Peace, Order and good Government\", it would be possible for the Parliament of Canada to enact colourable legislation, and wrongly assume powers that belong to the provincial legislatures. Confederation has been erected on more solid foundations.\nBut such is not the case. The war has created an emergency that justified the Governor General in Council to bring the War Measures Act in operation and pass regulations to meet such an emergency. Parliament then enacted The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, and The Continuation of Transitional Measures Act, 1947, because in its opinion the emergency that arose out of the war was still existing, and for the express purpose of decontrolling, and to complete the orderly transition from abnormal to normal conditions. The regulations that were passed to reach that aim are essentially of a temporary character, and the laws from which they derive their validity are in no way permanent. They will come to an end with the emergency.\nMy answer to the interrogatory is therefore in the negative.\nRand J.: The Governor in Council has referred to this Court the following question:\u2014\nAre The Wartime Leasehold Regulations ultra vires either in whole or in part and if so in what particulars or to what extent?\nThese are part of the general regulations made under the authority of The War Measures Act which applied to virtually the entire economic organization of the country, and which no one has seriously suggested were not valid up to the end of actual hostilities, assuming that stage to have been reached before say 1947. The contention before us that sought to end their force at that moment was that of Mr. Beaulieu on behalf of the Province of Quebec. His contention was this: once the war, as distinguished from its aftermath, had ended, the \"emergency\" by which the regulations were justified had come to an end and it was necessary to their continued validity that the state of things immediately following should constitute, in effect, a new emergency; the latter would be a peacetime emergency, and would necessarily be considered apart from its cause. In that view, it would be obligatory upon those supporting the continuance of the central power to show the existence of such a state of things, which had not been done.\nIn the sense so used, the word \"emergency\" carries the objectionable insufficiency which prompted the remarks of Viscount Simon in the Temperance litigation reported in [1946] A.C. 193 at p. 206: as he there observed, an emergency may be the occasion which calls for the legislation, but it is the nature of the legislation itself, and not the existence of emergency, that must determine whether it is valid or not. It is the conditions brought about by war that justify the regulation here; and the narrow question is whether the regulation can continue while the conditions remain.\nIn considering the situation at the war's end, it must be kept in mind that the regulations themselves have played an effective part in producing it. If, at that moment, all restrictions were to be abandoned, no one could doubt that serious disturbances and hardship would follow, and it would not be sufficient to say that they would become the responsibility of the provinces.\nThat circumstance was emphasized in the case of Dawson v. The Commonwealth 34, in which Leatham, C.J. at p. 176 says:\u2014\nThe defence power does not cease instantaneously to be available as a source of legislative authority with the termination of actual hostilities or even with the end of the war * * * The fact that the Regulations have been in operation itself creates an economic condition which may reasonably be thought to require that continued operation for some further period in order to bring about a gradual return to what might be called more normal conditions, instead of exposing the community to the consequences of a sudden and abrupt creation of what may be a legislative vacuum.\nIt seems to me to be a legitimate consideration that persons who might directly or indirectly be affected by such drastic action would naturally look to the government originally responsible to take or continue reasonable measures to effect transition with as little injury to them as is consistent with regard to others.\nThere is direct authority on the question asked of us. It is now settled that for the emergency of war, on which the validity of the regulations is rested, and within con- stitutional procedure, there is virtually no limitation to the scope of legislative action which Parliament, considering it necessary, may take for the defence of the country: Japanese Reference 35. That means, among other things, the preservation of the constitutional structure itself whose internal organization governs the ordinary peacetime life of the country. To suggest that the constitutional legislative position of the provinces presents impediments and limitations to the overriding necessity of maintaining the foundation upon which it rests indicates a somewhat inadequate appreciation of the realities of organized society in the world of these times, as well as of the constitutional statute.\nIn Fort Frances Pulp & Power Co. v. Winnipeg Free Press 36 the Judicial Committee, speaking through Viscount Haldane, held that an order issued in 1920 by the Paper Controller fixing prices which the Pulp Company should charge the Free Press for a period up to December 31, 1919, was within the authority of Parliament under the power to legislate for the peace, order and good government of the Dominion; and in the course of the reasons, at p. 706, this language is used:\u2014\nAt what date did the disturbed condition of Canada which the war had produced so entirely pass away that the legislative measures relied on in the present case became ultra vires?\nAnd at p. 707:\u2014\nTheir Lordships find themselves unable to say that the Dominion Government had no good reason for thus temporarily continuing the paper control after actual war had ceased, but while the effects of war conditions might still be operative.\nViscount Haldane does not consider the question whether the regulations could be justified by the power of the Dominion to legislate for defence, on which the Australian legislation was upheld, but with that it is not necessary now to deal.\nBy what means, then, is it to be determined that economic disturbances caused by the war have not yet \"entirely\" disappeared? A conclusion of this sort is to be gathered from an appreciation of conditions throughout the country. Evidence of that is furnished to Parliament by the representatives in both the Houses: it is gathered by the agencies of the Dominion government charged with country-wide enquiry, which are at the same time receiving centres of complaints and communications from all districts. There is also the common knowledge of which the Court can take judicial notice.\nOf matters of that sort we have the following. In the latest legislative enactment, that of The Continuation of the Transitional Measures Act, 1947, these recitals appear:\u2014\nWhereas Parliament, in view of the continuation of the national emergency arising out of the war, by The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, conferred upon the Governor in Council certain transitional powers * * *\nAnd whereas the national emergency arising out of the war, in certain aspects, has continued since the unconditional surrender of Germany and Japan and is still continuing; * * *\nAnd whereas it is necessary by reason of the existing national emergency that certain orders and regulations * * * be continued in force temporarily * * * in order to ensure an orderly transition from war to peace;\nThey were followed in 1948 by an address of both Houses of Parliament provided for by the Act, by which its life was extended for a further year; and a similar address in 1949 for the same purpose. These are express and implied affirmations by the two legislative bodies to the effect that the abnormal conditions attributable to the war are still to some extent present, and that in the opinion of Parliament an appropriate degree of regulation is still required for the surrender, without too great shock or violence, of segments of the country's economy to the normal operation of economic forces. With those declarations and the matters of general public knowledge, at least not inconsistent with them, before us, and with nothing seriously challenging them, it would be quite impossible for this Court to find that the war conditions had in fact entirely disappeared, that the declarations of Parliament were not made in good faith, and that its legislation, for some purpose other than that of an orderly accommodation of the regulations to the last stages of the economic derangement, was a colourable device for dealing with matters beyond its jurisdiction.\nMy answer to the question is, therefore, that the regulations are not, in whole or part, ultra vires.\nKellock J.:\u2014By s. 3 of the War Measures Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 206, brought into operation by proclamation on September 1, 1939, \"the Governor-in-Council may do and authorize such acts and things and make from time to time such orders and regulations as he may by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war * * * deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace and welfare of Canada\". While the section goes on to provide that this authority shall extend to certain enumerated classes of subjects, it is expressly enacted that this enumeration is merely for greater certainty and not so as to restrict the generality of the earlier language; Co-operative Committee on Japanese Canadians v. Attorney-General for Canada 37.\nUnder the authority of this statute wartime economic controls, including measures respecting prices and rents, were by Order-in-Council introduced in Canada gradually during the earlier years of the war. Those earlier controls were directed to the meeting of specific difficulties of supply resulting from conditions brought about by the war.\nLater, and toward the end of 1941, when a broad inflationary rise in prices generally began to develop, more comprehensive measures designed to maintain economic stability were put into effect, including the establishment of a general price \"ceiling\". Limitation of rents was also extended so as to include all real property, with the exception of farms. In the great majority of cases rents in effect in October, 1941, were \"frozen\". Control of wages and salaries also, which, up to that time, had been limited to \"war industries\", was extended to all industries. By the end of 1942 a fairly complete and integrated system of economic controls had been established and this continued with little change until the summer of 1945.\nFollowing cessation of active hostilities with Germany, these controls began to be eased in the summer of 1945, the first steps being with respect to the use of metals and other materials no longer required for active war purposes. By the end of the year 1946, controls over these particular materials had disappeared. During 1946 wage controls were at first relaxed and later abolished and in that year also there began the easing of the control of prices generally, which continued at an accelerated rate during 1947 and 1948, while rationing of consumers came to an end during 1947. The respondents accept the accuracy of the statement placed before the court on behalf of the federal government that:\nBoth price controls and subsidies were withdrawn in steps and stages, with a view to easing the Canadian price structure up toward the world price level in an orderly manner. At times it was necessary to slow down the process of decontrol and occasionally to retrace a few steps when, for example, a long series of protracted industrial disputes in 1946 interrupted the improvement of supplies, and late in 1947 when severe exchange conservation measures required the reimposition of price controls on certain fruits and vegetables. But there was a steady and progressive contraction of the area under control.\nThe pace of rent decontrol has been slower for a variety of reasons.\nThe effect of demobilization of the members of the Armed Forces accentuated the already existing shortage of houses. Demobilized persons again took up family residences. Many of them married to form new families. Thus the end of hostilities did not, as in the case of other controls, immediately change the conditions that led to the application of controls to accommodation but in fact for the time being intensified these conditions.\nAgain wartime conditions brought about a significant change in the balance between the demand and supply for houses in Canada. Wartime economic activities increased the demand for housing because of higher incomes which have continued after the war. On the other hand, increases in the supply of houses which might have been expected in these circumstances was cut down by restrictions on civilian construction to release materials and labour for war purposes. This lack of balance between demand and supply takes longer to adjust than in the case of the supply of other goods or services.\nAs to the nature of the controls affecting real property, the Wartime Prices and Trade Board had been authorized, in addition to the fixing of maximum rents, from time to time, to prescribe the manner in which rentals should be ascertained and what should constitute or be included in any rental. The Board was also authorized to prescribe the grounds on which and the manner in which leases might be terminated and to prohibit termination of leases or eviction otherwise. Every order made in pursuance of the regulations was to apply throughout Canada unless the contrary was specified therein but might be localized to an area or areas or to a class or classes of persons or to types of property.\nOn the 18th of December, 1945, 9-10 Geo. VI, c. 25, which came into force on January 1, 1946, was passed. By s. 5 it was provided that on and after that day the war against Germany and Japan should, for the purposes of the War Measures Act, be deemed no longer to exist. By s. 4 it was provided that the Governor-in-Council might order that orders and regulations lawfully made under the War Measures Act, or pursuant to authority created under that Act, in force immediately before the statute came into force, should, while it remained in force, continue in full force and effect, subject to amendment or revocation under its provisions. By s. 6 the statute was to expire on December 31, 1946, if Parliament should meet during November or December of that year, and if not, then on the fifteenth day after Parliament should first meet in 1947. The section also provided that upon addresses presented to the Governor General by the Senate and the House of Commons at any time while the statute remained in force, praying that the Act should be continued in force for a further period not exceeding in any case one year, it should so continue.\nBy P.C. 7414 of December 28, 1945, the power conferred by s. 4 was exercised with respect to all orders and regulations lawfully made under the War Measures Act, or pursuant to authority created under that Act and in force immediately before the Act of 1945 came into force. Section 12 of the Interpretation Act made this Order-in-Council effective.\nBy 10 Geo. VI, c. 60, assented to on the 31st of August, 1946, a new section 6 was enacted and provision was made for the continuation of the statute until the 31st day of December, 1946, on essentially the same terms as had been provided by the original section. Further, by P.C. 1112 of the 25th of March, 1947, which recited that addresses of the Senate and House of Commons had been presented praying for the continuation of the 1945 statute until the 15th day of May, 1947, it was provided that the Act should remain in force until that date.\nBy 11 Geo. VI, c. 16, assented to on the 14th of May, 1947, which, by s. 6, was to come into force immediately after the expiry of the 1945 statute, certain Orders-in-Council, including the Wartime Leasehold Regulations, were to continue in force during the term of the new statute subject to revocation in whole or in part by the Governor-in-Council. Provision for the continuation of the Act was also made by s. 7 in terms similar to s. 6 of the earlier statute. By P.C. 5304 of December 30, 1947, the 1947 statute was continued in (force to March 31, 1948, addresses for the purpose by the Senate and House of Commons having been presented. This legislation has been continued in force by 11-12 Geo. VI, c. 5 and 13 Geo. VI, c. 3. Unless further extended it will expire on March 31, 1950.\nIt was not suggested by anyone on the argument that conditions did not exist justifying the bringing into force of the War Measures Act, nor that under its provisions regulations could not properly have been enacted which would affect landlords and tenants. But it was contended that the conditions which constituted the basis for the continued exercise of this legislative jurisdiction by the federal authority had either passed away or that the particular regulations which are here in question had never been enacted in relation to that jurisdiction but had been at all times enactments purely in relation to property and civil rights in the provinces and therefore at all times beyond the jurisdiction of Parliament.\nAs will be seen from the above summary of its terms, the legislation outlined above is temporary legislation, having its inception in the extraordinary conditions consequent upon the magnitude of the war which commenced in September, 1939. As has been frequently laid down, subjects which would normally belong exclusively to provincial jurisdiction under classes of subjects specifically assigned by s. 92 of the British North America Act may, in time of war, assume a significance of paramount importance and of dimensions that give rise to a standard of necessity calling for the exercise of powers vested only in the federal authority. In such circumstances it is, as Viscount Haldane pointed out in the Fort Frances case 38, that:\nIt is proprietary and civil rights in new relations, which they do not present in normal times, that have to be dealt with; and these relations, which affect Canada as an entirety, fall within s. 91, because in their fullness they extend beyond what s. 92 can really cover. The kind of power adequate for dealing with them is only to be found in that part of the constitution which establishes power in the State as a whole. For it is not one that can be reliably provided for by depending on collective action of the Legislatures of the individual Provinces agreeing for the purpose. Dealing first with the question as to whether the conditions which justified the initial legislation by Parliament have now completely passed away so as no longer to justify the particular regulations here in question, it was pointed out in the Fort Frances case that the question as to the extent to which provision for such circumstances may have to be continued is one on which a court of law is loath to enter. It may be, as their Lordships said in that case, that it has become \"clear\" that the crisis which arose is \"wholly\" at an end and that there is \"no\" justification for the continued exercise of an exceptional interference which becomes ultra vires when no longer called for, but very clear evidence that the crisis has \"wholly\" passed away would be required to justify a court in overruling the decision of the government that exceptional measures were still requisite.\nTheir Lordships asked the question as to when, in the case before them, it was to be said that the necessity \"altogether\" ceased for maintaining the exceptional measure of control there in question. At what date did the disturbed state of Canada which the war had produced so \"entirely\" pass away that the legislative measures in question became ultra vires? Their Lordships found that there was \"no clear and unmistakable evidence\" in that case that the government was in error in \"thinking\" that the necessity was still in existence and they found themselves unable to say that the Dominion Government had \"no good reason\" for temporarily continuing the control after actual war had ceased, but while the effects of war conditions might still be operative.\nIn the Japanese reference ubi cit, the Judicial Committee reaffirmed the principles laid down in the Fort Frances case. The statute there in question provided by s. 2 that the Governor-in-Council might do ,and authorize such acts and things, and make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he might, by reason of the continued existence of the national emergency arising out of the war against Germany and Japan, deem necessary or advisable for the purpose of\n(c) maintaining, controlling and regulating * * * prices * * * use and occupation of property, rentals * * * to ensure economic stability and an orderly transition to conditions of peace; (e) continuing or discontinuing in an orderly manner, as the emergency permits, measures adopted during and by reason of the war.\nIn the Japanese Canadian reference it was contended that at the date of the passing of the Act of 1945 there did not exist any such emergency as justified Parliament in empowering the Governor-in-Council to pass the orders there in question, as the emergency which had dictated their making\u2014namely, active hostilities, had come to an end. It was said that a new emergency justifying exceptional measures might indeed have arisen, but it was by no means the case that measures taken to deal with the emergency which led to the proclamation bringing the War Measures Act into force were demanded by the emergency which faced Parliament at the time of the passing of the Act. This contention however, was rejected by the Privy Council as it had been by this court. After pointing out that the statute in its preamble clearly stated the view of Parliament as to the necessity of imposing the powers which were exercised, Lord Wright, who delivered the judgment, added:\nThe argument under consideration invites their Lordships, on speculative grounds alone, to overrule either the considered decision of Parliament to confer the powers or the decision of the Governor in Council to exercise them. So to do would be contrary to the principles laid down in Fort Frances Pulp & Power Co. v. Manitoba Free Press Co. 39 and accepted by their Lordships earlier in this opinion.\nIn the preamble to the statute of 1947 which is still in force, it is recited that:\n* * * the national emergency arising out of the war, in certain aspects, has continued since the unconditional surrender of Germany and Japan and is still continuing * * * And whereas it is necessary by reason of the existing national emergency that certain orders and regulations of the Governor in Council made under the War Measures Act and The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1946, be continued in force temporarily notwithstanding the expiry of The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, in order to ensure an orderly transition from war to peace * * *\nWhile a recital in an act of Parliament cannot be conclusive on a question such as is here involved, it at least furnishes evidence that, in the mind of Parliament, legislation was directed to a continuing condition. There is no suggestion in the present case of bad faith on the part of Parliament. In my opinion the undoubted legislative power of Parliament in respect of conditions arising out of an emergency such as that created by a war of the proportions of the late war, as established by the authorities referred to, includes, not only the power to prosecute the war and to do everything necessary to that end, but also the power to effect the restoration of conditions of peace by gradual process if that is thought wise and \"not necessarily immediately by the crude process of immediate abandonment of all Eederal control\", to borrow language used by Latham C.J. in Dawson v. The Commonwealth 40, at 176. The fact that certain conditions have been created by the exercise of the defence power is itself a fact which is relevant to the validity of a continued exercise of that power.\nThe former Chief Justice of Canada, Sir Lyman Duff, (with whom the present Chief Justice concurred) expressed the same idea in other language in The King v. Eastern Terminal Elevator Co. 41, at 443, where he said:\nRegarded as legislation essential to prevent such a financial crisis as would be not unlikely to ensue upon the relinquishment, voluntary or forced, of Dominion control over the grain trade, the Canada Grain Act might well withstand the test of validity suggested in the Board of Commerce 42, the Fort Frances 43 and the Lemieux Act 44 cases.\nApplying the above principles, it is, in my opinion, clear that the court is not in a position, any more than it was in the case of the 1947 Reference, to overrule the decision of Parliament expressed as late as the 25th of March, 1949, that the rental regulations here in question are still necessary to meet conditions initially arising out of war but still continuing. The kind of evidence necessary to establish that the emergency calling for the exercise of the federal power has \"entirely\" passed away, is wholly lacking.\nThe only matter relied upon by the respondents as evidence to that end, was the statement in the Order of Reference that on October 23, 1948, the Minister of Finance had advised the premiers of each of the provincial governments that the Dominion government\nwas prepared to vacate the field to any province which might decide to undertake rent control. This, however, is not to be taken alone, as it is immediately followed 'by the statement that:\nIn offering to vacate the field to the provinces a year ago the federal government was not seeking to relieve itself of responsibility for rent control. It was motivated solely by concern for the situation that would arise should rent control be held to be beyond the constitutional powers of the federal authorities. It believed at that time that the sudden end of rent control would result in unnecessary disruption and hardship, and it offered to put the matter beyond doubt by giving the provinces an opportunity to introduce legislation that could not be successfully challenged in the courts.\nAt the time of the above \"offer\" there was in effect Dominion-wide legislation designed to deal with a Dominion-wide problem. If it had developed t'hait that problem could have been dealt with by common action agreed upon by the provinces, it might have been that any further justification for the exercise of federal legislative jurisdiction would have ceased. On the contrary, however, \"none of the (then existing provinces was prepared to undertake rent control\" and the problem did not become one that could be \"reliably provided for by depending on collective action of the legislatures of the individual provinces agreeing for that purpose\", to quote again from the Fort Frances case at 704. As the provinces could not in fact agree, the Dominion considered it necessary that this legislation should remain. I do not think that, in the existing circumstances, had one or more of the provinces undertaken to exercise \"rent control\" within their respective limits so as adequately to form the necessary links with Dominion legislation elsewhere in the country wide system of control, the powers of the Dominion Government to maintain its legislation would have been affected.\nIf clear evidence had been adduced of the disappearance of any conditions justifying the continued operation of the federal legislation, it would, of course, be not only within the power but the duty of the court to declare the legislation invalid, but in the present case there is nothing of the kind. Such facts as are common knowledge, and of which the court may take judicial notice, indicate the contrary. To this may be added what is obvious, namely, that in such circumstances it is not for the court to consider the wisdom or propriety of the particular policy embodied in the residual emergency legislation. That is matter exclusively for Parliament. With respect to the second objection to the validity of the regulations, namely, the contention that, from a perusal of the Orders-in-Council, the court could say that their provisions were not enacted with relation to the Dominion field of legislative jurisdiction in time of war, but purely in relation to property and civil rights, in my opinion this contention cannot be sustained. I think it is sufficiently clear that the measures here in question were enacted from the point of view of what was considered called for in the conditions then prevailing. In that view they are valid. Their continuing validity I have already dealt with.\nMy answer, therefore, to the question referred, is that the Wartime Leasehold Regulations are intra vires.\nEstey J.:\u2014His Excellency the Governor General in Council under s. 55 of The Supreme Court Act referred to this Court the question:\nAre The Wartime Leasehold Regulations ultra vires either in whole or in part and if so in what particulars or to what extent?\nThe Wartime Leasehold Regulations were enacted by Order in Council P.C. 9029, November 21, 1941, under the authority of the War Measures Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 206. In 1945 Parliament, after the conclusion of actual hostilities, deemed it desirable that legislation in respect to the emergency arising out of the war should be dealt with under special authority and as a result The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 6. of C. 1945, c. 25, was enacted which continued these Wartime Leasehold Regulations in force. This statute remained in force until May 15, 1947, when The Continuation of Transitional Measures Act, S. of C. 1947, c. 16, became effective and continued in force such of these Wartime Leasehold Regulations as had not been repealed.\nThe validity of the War Measures Act was upheld in Fort Frances Pulp v. Manitoba Free Press 45, and The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, in The Co-operative Committee on Japanese Canadians v. The Attorney-General of Canada 46. The power of the Governor in Council to legislate under the War Measures Act by Order in Council was upheld in In re Gray 47, and Reference re Chemicals, 48. The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, was held to be valid Dominion legislation in the Japanese Reference, supra, and in the course of the judgment of their Lordships of the Privy Council, Lord Wright at p. 101 stated:\nAgain if it be clear that an emergency has not arisen, or no longer exists, there can be no justification for the exercise or continued exercise of the exceptional powers. The rule of law as to the distribution of powers between the Parliaments of the Dominion and the Parliaments of the provinces comes into play. But very clear evidence that an emergency has not arisen, or that the emergency no longer exists is required to justify the judiciary even though the question is one of ultra vires, in overruling the decision of the Parliament of the Dominion that exceptional measures were required or were still required.\nThe recital and the provisions of The Continuation of Transitional Measures Act set forth that the emergency arising out of the war still continued but only \"in certain aspects\" and that certain orders and regulations then existing should \"be continued in force temporarily * * * in order to ensure an orderly transition from war to peace\". Of even greater significance is that by s. 4 the power vested in the Governor in Council is restricted to the revocation either in whole or in part of any existing order or regulation. Parliament here indicates a clear (intention that this legislation is of a temporary character, which is further emphasized by the amendments made in 1948 (S. of C. 1948, c. 5) and in 1949 (S. of C. 1949, c. 3). In the latter amendment sec. 7 reads:\n7. Subject as hereinafter provided, this Act shall expire on the sixtieth day after Parliament first meets during the year one thousand nine hundred and fifty or on the thirty-first day of March, one thousand nine hundred and fifty, whichever date is the earlier: Provided that, if at any time while this Act is in force, Addresses are presented to the Governor General by the Senate and House of Commons, respectively, praying that this Act should be continued in force for a further period, not in any case exceeding one year, from the time at which it would otherwise expire and the Governor in Council so orders, this Act shall continue in force for that further period.\nThe true nature and character of The Continuation of Transitional Measures Act, 1947, is that those orders and regulations necessary because of the continuation of the emergency arising out of the war should, so far as it may be necessary, be continued but that they might gradually and in an orderly manner be repealed as the conditions of emergency continue to diminish. It is in principle legis- lation similar to The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act and valid under the authority of the Japanese Reference, supra.\nThe Attorney-General of Canada submitted that The Wartime Leasehold Regulations as continued in the Schedule of The Continuation of Transitional Measures Act, 1947, were valid legislation in relation to the emergency arising out of the war and for the withdrawal in an orderly manner of measures adopted to meet the emergency. In this he was supported by counsel for the respective parties appearing in support of these regulations.\nIn this submission the essential question is, therefore, does the emergency arising out of the war still exist. This is primarily a matter that the representatives of the people in Parliament must determine. They are not only familiar with the conditions that obtain throughout the various parts of the Dominion, but they have available to them the records and statistics upon which such a question may be determined. The position of the Courts in the consideration of this question is indicated by Viscount Haldane in the Fort Frances case, supra, at p. 706:\n* * * the effect of the economic and other disturbance occasioned originally by the war may thus continue for some time after it is terminated. The question of the extent to which provision for circumstances such as these may have to be maintained is one on which a Court of law is loath to enter. No authority other than the centra. Government is in a position to deal with a problem which is essentially one of statesmanship * * * But very clear evidence that the crisis had wholly passed away would be required to justify the judiciary, even when the question raised was one of ultra vires which it had to decide, in overruling the decision of the Government that exceptional measures were still requisite.\nParliament in 1947 by the recital and provisions contained in The Continuation of Transitional Measures Act and the inclusion of The Wartime Leasehold Regulations in the Schedule thereto declared that the emergency in relation to which the regulations were passed still continued. It was clear, however, from the provisions of that statute that the conditions were changing to the point that no longer was it necessary that the 'Governor in Council should be authorized to pass new orders and regulations. In fact many of these Leasehold Regulations had already been repealed and at the time of this reference only housing and shared accommodation were subject thereto. All this indicates that the Dominion has been pursuing a course of gradual decontrol and when the emergency no longer exist its legislation will be completely repealed. It was no doubt in appreciation of these facts that the Province of Ontario supported the submission on behalf of the Dominion and stated \"Parliament must be left with a reasonable time (which has not yet expired) to decontrol in an orderly manner\" and \"which is being done as rapidly as circumstances warrant\". This position was also supported by all of counsel appearing in support of the validity of these regulations.\nIt was contended that the statement of the Minister of Finance in 1948 embodied and made a part of Order in Council P.C. 5840 submitting this reference should be construed to mean \"that the circumstances were such that it was no longer essential for Canada as a whole for the Dominion to continue to deal with the landlord and tenant relationship\". This submission does not, except by implication, contend that the emergency no longer exists. As already intimated, the Dominion so long as the emergency continues possesses the authority to legislate in relation thereto and how far it should do so is a matter of statesmanship, in regard to which the following is pertinent:\nIt is enough to say that there is no clear and unmistakable evidence that the Government was in error in thinking that the necessity was still in existence at the dates on which the action in question was taken by the Paper Control Tribunal. Viscount Haldane in the Fort Frances case, supra, at p. 706.\nThe Minister made the statement because the constitutional validity of these Leasehold Regulations had been challenged in the Courts and because in his opinion the emergency still continued. He was, in these circumstances, concerned that Should the Courts declare these regulations invalid that the provinces would be prepared to deal with the problem of rent control and by way of assistance and on behalf of the Government he offered to each province its records, information, experience, staff and \"subject to Parliament's approval, to pay the cost of any provincial rental administration for one year\". Emphasis was placed upon that portion of the statement intimating that the Federal Government was \"ready at any time to vacate the field of rent control to any province which makes a formal request to that effect\". This portion must be read and construed as part of the statement as a whole. When so read it indicates that the emergency still continues and is consistent with the position taken throughout by the Dominion that as the scope of the emergency narrows its legislation will be repealed. It can mean no more than that while the emergency still exists, it has so far eased or narrowed that if a province \"makes a formal request\" the Dominion will not prevent it operating \"in the field of rent control\". The Minister's statement does not support either a conclusion that the emergency no longer continues or that it is within the authorities no longer essential for the Dominion to deal therewith.\nIn considering some of the other objections to the validity of these regulations, it is important to keep in mind that the emergency arising out of the war with Germany and Japan was of such magnitude and extent that it imperilled the existence of the Dominion as a nation; that within the terms of the B.N.A. Act the Dominion is authorized to deal effectively with this emergency and in that aspect to legislate in relation thereto. That such legislation may involve provisions that under normal circumstances would be classified as in relation to matters which under s. 92 are assigned exclusively to the provinces does not impair its validity. That as enacted it may affect property and civil rights or other matters enumerated under s. 92 must be admitted. If, however, it be legislation in relation to the emergency, so long as that emergency may continue it must be held to override or suspend the provincial legislation, and, indeed, any Dominion legislation with which it may be in conflict. In re Gray, supra.\nIt is unnecessary to set forth the scope and far reaching effects of the national effort. It is sufficient to observe, and it was not contended otherwise, as part thereof it was necessary that as large a measure of economic stability as possible should be maintained. Legislation toward the attainment of that end was unquestionably legislation in relation to the emergency and therefore competent on the part of the Dominion. Neither this nor the fact that such involved legislation for the control of prices, wages, salaries and industry was contested. Any suggestion that this did not include the control of rent cannot be accepted. Rent, in an important respect, is but the price of building and housing accommodation. When prices, wages and salaries are controlled the omission to control rent would at least in part nullify the effectiveness of these controls in the attainment of economic stability. Indeed, these Leasehold Regulations cannot be considered separate and apart from but rather as a part of that body of legislation enacted toward the attainment of economic stability which included prices and trade regulations, control of industries, wages and salaries.\nIt is equally important toward the attainment of this end that building and housing accommodation should be utilized to the best possible advantage and security of tenure made possible. It was therefore not only necessary that rents be fixed but the termination of the leases should also be subject to control. In this regard it is only necessary to recall that building materials during the period of combat had to be largely directed to other than the construction of commercial and housing accommodation and that this made the situation particularly difficult at those points where population had to be concentrated. Any suggestion therefore that these Leasehold Regulations as originally enacted were not in relation to the emergency arising out of the war cannot be maintained.\nThat the conditions of the emergency arising out of the war continue after cessation of actual combat has been recognized in both the Fort Frances case, supra, and the Japanese Reference, supra. It was submitted, however, on behalf of the Province of Quebec that under the authorities legislation in relation to the emergency, once the actual combat has ceased, must be confined to the completion of that which had been commenced during the period of hostilities. It was suggested that the Fort Frances case supported that view. The statute there in question was S. of C. 1919, 9 & 10 Ceo. V, c. 63. This statute does not appear to justify so limited a construction. The Order in Council was passed July 8, 1920. Viscount Haldane stated at p. 707:\nIt will be observed that this Order in Council deals only with the results following from the cessation of actual war conditions. It excepts from repeal certain measures concerned with consequential conditions arising out of war, which may obviously continue to produce effects remaining in operation after war itself is over.\nIn the Japanese Reference, supra, the Orders in Council were made originally on December 15, 1945, under The War Measures Act. They were continued as valid legislation in relation to the emergency which still continued under The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act which came into force January 1, 1945. These Orders in Council were therefore enacted in the first instance after actual combat had ceased and were held to be valid legislation in relation to the emergency.\nNeither of these oases support the limited view here contended for but rather indicate that their Lordships in the Privy Council rested their decisions on the broad basis that Parliament has authority to deal adequately with the emergency so long as it may continue after actual combat has ceased.\nIt was also submitted on behalf of the Province of Quebec that \"the dislocations in changing from a wartime economy to conditions of peace are not by themselves sufficient to justify the invasion by the Dominion Parliament of the exclusive field of competency assigned to the provinces.\" Support for' this submission was sought in the Board of Commerce case 49, in which the validity of two statutes enacted by the Parliament of Canada\u2014The Board of Commerce Act and The Combines and Fair Prices Act (respectively 9 & 10 Geo. V, c. 37 and c. 45) was in question. These statutes were enacted in the postwar period but whether they arose out of dislocations in changing from a wartime to a peacetime economy need not be determined. They were not in relation to any emergency arising out of the First Great War but rather were enacted in respect of other matters and as permanent Dominion legislation. Because they were statutes in relation to matters upon which, under s. 92, the provinces have exclusive power to legislate, they were held to be invalid. It is quite conceivable that dislocations in the postwar period may exist which are not in any proper sense part of the emergency arising out of the war. The jurisdiction, however, of the Dominion is restricted to legislating in relation to the emergency arising out of the war as discussed in the Fort Frances case. It is significant that the Fort Frances case was decided in the year following the Board of Commerce case and Viscount Haldane, Lord Buckmaster and Lord Phillimore were members of the Judicial Committee in both cases and Viscount Haldane wrote both judgments. As already stated, in the former the Judicial Committee was dealing with legislation that was not, while in the latter it was dealing with legislation that was in relation to the emergency.\nIt was also contended that these Leasehold Regulations were as originally enacted invalid because the War Measures Act did not \"authorize the exercise of the power of delegation in the case of the matters dealt with by P.C. 9029 and the Rental Regulations.\" In support of this it was contended that the delegated powers had to be found in sub-paragraphs (a) to (f) of subsection 3 of the War Measures Act. This submission is contrary to the express words of the section in which, after providing in clear and comprehensive terms that the Governor in Council may within the terms thereof do whatever he deems \"necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada,\" continues \"and for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms,\" and then sets out sub-paragraphs (a) to (f). This section was formerly s. 6 and the foregoing submission was rejected in In re Gray, supra. In that case at p. 168 it is pointed out that the enumerated portions instead of qualifying the general terms of the section \"emphasizes the comprehensive character of it and pointedly suggests the intention that the words are to be comprehensively interpreted and applied\".\nThe contention that P.C. 9029 \"ceased to be valid as soon as Parliament declared the War Measures Act as no longer the statute upon which authority therefor was based\" is completely answered in the Japanese Reference, supra. If that contention had been correct the decision in the Japanese case would have been otherwise.\nIn my opinion The Wartime Leasehold Regulations neither in whole nor in part are ultra vires.\nLocke J.:\u2014By s. 3 of the War Measures Act, 1914 (2nd Session, c. 2) it is provided, inter alia, that the Governor in Council may do and authorize such acts and things and make from time to time such- orders and regulations as he may, by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection, deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada. Without restricting the generality of this language, the section further declares that the powers of the Governor in Council shall extend to all matters coming within certain enumerated classes of subjects which include the appropriation, control, forfeiture and disposition of property and of the use thereof. Under these powers a great variety of regulations were made during the second World War, virtually taking charge of and directing the economic life of Canada, and various boards set up to administer them. These included the Wartime Prices and Trade Regulations, the Wartime Industries Control Board Regulations, the Wartime Wages Control Order, the Wartime Salaries Order, the Mobilization Regulations and the Selective Service Regulations, in addition to the Wartime Leasehold Regulations. The necessity for measures such as these in time of war is apparent and the Leasehold Regulations were merely part of the general control which it was considered necessary to exercise in the interest of the country as a whole.\nThe War Measures Act continued in effect until December 31, 1945. On January 1, 1946, The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, came into force. That statute contained a declaration that as of the last mentioned date the war against Germany and Japan should for the purposes of the War Measures Act be deemed no longer to exist. The preamble to the statute, after reciting the powers vested in the Governor in Council by the War Measures Act to make orders and regulations deemed necessary or advisable for the security, defence, order and welfare of Canada, recited in part that:\u2014\nWhereas during the national emergency arising by reason of the war against Germany and Japan measures have been adopted under the War Measures Act for the military requirements and security of Canada and the maintenance of economic stability; And whereas the national emergency arising out of the war has continued since the unconditional surrender of Germany and Japan and is still continuing; And whereas it is essential in the national interest that certain transitional powers continue to be exercisable by the Governor in Council during the continuation of the exceptional conditions brought about by the war * * *\nBy s. 2 the Governor in Council was authorized to make such orders and regulations \"as he may, by reason of the continued existence of the national emergency arising out of the war against Germany and Japan, deem necessary or advisable for the purpose of continuing or discontinuing in an orderly manner, as the emergency permits, measures adopted during and by reason of the war\".\nBy Order-in-Council of December 28, 1945, all orders and regulations lawfully made under the War Measures Act and in effect on December 31, 1945, were continued in force, subject to amendment or revocation under The National Emergency Transition Powers Act, 1945. The last mentioned statute which by its terms was stated to expire on December 31, 1946, was continued in force until May 15, 1947, pursuant to c. 50 of the Statutes of Canada 1946. The Continuation of Transitional Measures Act, 1947 continued the Leasehold Regulations in force for a further period.\nThe preamble to that Act, after reciting the circumstances under which the 1945 statute had been passed, recited that the national emergency rising out of the war in certain aspects had continued and was still continuing and that it was necessary \"by reason of the existing national emergency\" that certain orders and regulations of the Governor in Council made under the War Measures Act and the 1945 Act should be continued in force temporarily, notwithstanding the expiry of The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, in order to ensure an orderly transition from war to peace. These included the Wartime Leasehold Regulations then in effect. By c. 25, Statutes of 1948, and c. 3, Statutes of 1949, the 1947 Act was amended and continued in force so that, as matters now stand, it will expire on the sixtieth day after Parliament first meets during the present year or on March 31, whichever date is the earlier, provided that if at any time while the Act is in effect addresses are presented to the Governor General by the Senate and House of Commons respectively, praying that the Act should be continued in force for a further period not in any case exceeding one year, and the Governor in Council so orders, it shall continue in force for such further period.\nBy the order of reference, we are informed that the exceptional conditions brought about by the war which made the Wartime Leasehold Regulations necessary are still continuing and that the orderly transition from war to peace had not yet been completed. In addition to this information there is included in the order an announcement made in the House of Commons by the Minister of Finance on November 3, 1949, stating that the purpose of the Government was to proceed in an orderly way towards the eventual withdrawal of all wartime controls. We are further informed that the controls imposed by orders made under the authority of the War Measures Act and the Acts of 1945 and 1947 have been largely rescinded or relaxed. In the case of the Wartime Leasehold Regulations, the orders now in effect apply to the rentals for and the leasing of housing accommodation and shared accommodation only.\nThat the War Measures Act was intra vires Parliament has been long since settled (Fort Frances Pulp and Power Co. v. Manitoba Free Press Co. 50). Counsel for the Canadian Federation of Property Owners' Associations contends, however, that the Rental Regulations were outside of the powers vested in the Governor in Council by that statute. As to this, it is my opinion that these regulations fell clearly within the general language of the opening clause of s. 3 as well as within the enumeration in clause (f) as dealing with the appropriation, disposition and use of property.\nThe main ground of objection to the present regulations is that it is said that they trench upon the powers of the Legislatures of the Provinces to exclusively make laws in relation to property and civil rights within their boundaries. That these regulations affect property and civil rights in all of the provinces of Canada, other than Newfoundland, is not open to doubt. For those who attack their validity, it is said that, whatever justification there may have been for the making of the regulations during the period of the war, no present justification exists for their continuance.\nWhile the question we are required to determine is as to whether the Wartime Leasehold Regulations are ultra vires, either in whole or in part, since it is not contended that these are not authorized by The Continuation of Transitional Measures Act, 1947 as amended, the matter involves also the question as to whether that statute and the amending Acts are within the powers of Parliament. It is of importance to note at the outset that the statute is temporary in its nature, a fact which is made clear from the language of the preamble. This distinguishes the legislation from that which was considered in Re The Board of Commerce Act 51, where, as pointed out in the judgment of Viscount Haldane, the Act was not confined to any temporary purpose but was to continue without limit of time. We are to inquire into and determine what is the true nature and character of this legislation and it is, of course, true that in considering this question the matter is not determined by the language used in the preamble or elsewhere in the statute (Attorney-General for Ontario v. Reciprocal Insurers 52, Attorney-General for Manitoba v. Attorney-General for Canada 53. There is, however, in the present case no suggestion that the legislation is colourable in the sense that Parliament might be said under the guise of legislation to authorize measures deemed necessary for the peace, order and good government of Canada as a whole, of attempting to usurp provincial powers in respect of property and civil rights, or that the regulations are continued in force with any such object. There is nothing here to suggest that the recital in the Act that the national emergency arising out of the war in certain aspects has continued and still continues, making it necessary to continue the regulations in force temporarily, is not the considered opinion of Parliament, and the statement in the order of reference that the exceptional conditions brought about the war which made the Wartime Leasehold Regulations necessary are still continuing must, on a reference of this nature, be accepted as expressing the opinion of the Executive Government. This is not to say that, in other circumstances, regulations enacted to cope with a situation resulting from a lengthy war under a temporary statute of this nature might not, in the course of time, be found to be beyond the powers of Parliament, but it would be necessary that it should be very clear that the condition of emergency which necessitated their maintenance had passed away before the Court could properly be asked to overrule the decision of the Government that these exceptional measures were still necessary: Fort Frances Pulp and Power Company v. Manitoba Free Press 54. In my opinion, upon the material before us in the present matter, the question submitted is determined in favour of the validity of The Continuation of Transitional Measures Act, 1947 as amended and of the regulations by the decisions of the Judicial Committee in the Fort Frances case and in Co-Operative Committee on Japanese Canadians v. Attorney-General for Canada 55.\nMy answer to the question, therefore, is:\u2014The Wartime Leasehold Regulations are not ultra vires, either in whole or in part.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General of Canada: F.

As to the subsequent leases, they lacked authorization by Order in Council and consequently were void.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Exchequer Court, Cameron J. 1, whereby an action brought by the appellant for a declaration of right to a renewal of a lease of surrendered Indian lands, was refused.\nThe appellant in 1880 secured from the Council of the Chippewa and Pottawatomie Indians of Walpole Island a lease of part of their reserve, St. Ann's Island, for shooting and fishing for a term of five years and renewable for a like term but reserving to the said Indians their right to shoot and fish the leased area. The appellant having raised the question as to whether the lease was a valid one under the Indian Act, a formal surrender of the leased lands was made by the Indians to the Crown and an Order in Council was passed approving the surrender and confirming a lease from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs to the appellant for a term of five years renewable for a like term. From 1884 to 1925 several further leases were entered into between the same parties. Some contained no provision for renewal, some varied the terms of the original lease as to the amount of land, and the terms of payment. The 1925 lease excluded the Indians from shooting or fishing on the leased property and reserved that right to the appellant alone. It also provided for a term of 20 years with the right of renewal for further successive terms of ten years at rentals to be fixed by arbitration. In 1944 the appellant gave notice to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs of its intention to renew the lease but he refused to grant such renewal or to admit that the lessee was entitled thereto. The matter was subsequently under the provisions of s. 37 of the Exchequer Court Act, referred to that Court for adjudication.\nA. S. Pattillo and J. A. Macintosh, K.C., for the appellant.\nLee A. Kelley, K.C., and W. R. Jackett, K.C., for the respondent.\nKerwin J.:\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. It is unnecessary to consider that part of the reasons for judgment of the trial judge 2 dealing with the argument that the Crown was estopped from denying the validity of the tenancy of the appellant since counsel for the appellant stated that he did not now advance any such claim. As to the other points, I agree with the trial judge.\nDuring the argument a question was asked as to whether a contention could be advanced that the surrender \"to the end that said described territory may be leased to the applicants for the purpose of shooting and fishing for such term and on such conditions as the Superintendent of Indian Affairs may consider best for our advantage\", was really a surrender upon condition, and that if the condition were not fulfilled the land would revert. It was suggested in answer thereto that this would not assist the appellant and this was made quite clear by Mr. Jacket when he pointed to ss. 2 (i) and (k), 19, 48 and 49 of the Indian Act, c. 81, R.S.C. 1906. If by some means the lands again became part of the reserve, then s. 49 would apply and, except as in Part I otherwise provided, no release or surrender of a reserve or a portion thereof shall be valid or binding unless the release or surrender complies with the specified conditions.\nThe determination of the case really depends upon s. 51 of the Act. These lands were Indian lands which had been surrendered and, therefore, in the wording of the section \"shall be managed, leased and sold as the Governor in Council directs, subject to the conditions of surrender and the provisions of this part.\" Mr. Jacket pointed out that counsel for the appellant wanted s. 51 to be read as if the words \"subject to the conditions of surrender and the provisions of this part\" preceded \"all Indian lands, etc. * * * \", thus inserting those words, which now appear at the end, at the very commencement, and without taking into consideration the fact that the two parts of the section are separated by a semicolon. Reference was also made to s. 64 but the collocation of the word \"deed\" with \"lease or agreement\" shows that a surrender could not be included under the word \"deed\".\nThe trial judge answered the question in the negative and dismissed the claim with no costs to either the claimant or the respondent but there is no reason why costs in this Court should not go against the unsuccessful appellant.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Locke JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nTaschereau J.:\u2014By Petition of Right filed in December, 1945, the suppliant-appellant claimed that it was entitled to a renewal of a lease of certain premises, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, dated May 19, 1925. The first document to which we have been referred is a resolution dated March 18, 1880, adopted by the Council of the Chippewa and Pottawatomie Indians of Walpole Island, purporting to authorize an original lease to the St. Ann's Shooting and Fishing Club, of St. Ann's Island. Pursuant to this resolution, the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs executed the lease on May 30, 1881, \"for the purpose of shooting over the same and angling and trawling in the waters thereof\" for a period of five years, renewable on its expiration for a like term.\nFollowing the execution of this lease, the officers of the Club raised certain questions as to the validity of the lease, and more particularly as to whether there had been a surrender of the lands as required by the Indian Act of 1880, an acceptance thereof by the Governor General in Council, and finally, an Order in Council authorizing the lease. A further meeting of the Indians was therefore held in February, 1882, and a formal surrender was executed in due form, and on the 24th of February of the same year, the Indian Superintendent at Sarnia wrote to the Club that for the purpose of the lease, a formal surrender had been given, and that the defect in the preliminary proceedings had been remedied. In April, 1882, Order in Council No. 529 was passed purporting to accept the surrender, and on the 18th of April, the Department again advised the Club that the surrender had been accepted, and that the lease had been confirmed by the said Order in Council.\nIn 1884, 1892, 1894, 1906 and 1915, new leases were entered into between the same parties, but only those of 1894, 1906 and 1915 contained provisions for renewal. In all these leases, except the first one, trustees signed the agreements with the Superintendent General, on behalf of the St. Ann's Island Shooting and Fishing Club.\nIn May, 1925, the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs signed a new lease with Geoffrey T. Clarkson and Walter Gow, acting as trustees for the St. Ann's Island Shooting and Fishing Club Limited, and it provided that the lessees should be entitled on the expiration of the term granted, to renewals for further successive periods of ten years at rentals to be fixed by arbitration.\nThe lessees have been in possession of the lands in question since 1881, and have expended substantial amounts for the permanent improvement of their facilities as a hunting and fishing club, including the erection of a club house and other buildings and the opening up of ditches and canals. On September 4, 1945, Geoffrey T. Clarkson and Walter Gow assigned their interest in the lease to the appellant. Some correspondence was then exchanged between the Department of Indian Affairs and the Club, as to the renewal of the lease, but as the parties could not agree, it was therefore decided that the question should be referred to the Exchequer Court of Canada for adjudication. Pursuant to the dispositions of the general rules and orders of the Court, the appellant filed a statement of claim on December 17, 1945, and asked for a declaration that the Club was entitled to a renewal of the lease dated May 19, 1925, for a further term of ten years, and subject to the stipulations and provisions contained in the lease of May 19, 1925, save as to rental. The claimant also asked that the annual rent to be paid during the term of the renewal of the lease, from October 1, 1944, to September 30, 1955, be determined by the judgment, instead of by arbitration.\nMr. Justice Cameron, before whom the matter came, reached the conclusion that as the lease of 1925 was never authorized by Order in Council, it was, as well as the provisions for renewal, wholly void.\nThese lands in question were formerly part of a \"Reserve\" for the use or benefit of the Chippewa and Pottawatomie Indians of Walpole Island, and there is no doubt that they could not be originally leased in May, 1881, to the predecessors of the appellant, unless they had been surrendered to the Crown. The effect of a surrender is to make a reserve or part of a reserve, \"Indian Lands\", defined in section 2 of the Indian Act, para. (k) as \"any reserve or portion of a reserve which has been surrendered to the Crown\".\nThe necessary surrender was made as a result of the meeting held by the Indians in February, 1882, and which was accepted by Order in Council No. 529 in April of the same year. This Order in Council reads as follows:\u2014\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 3rd April, 1882.\nOn a Memorandum, dated 7th March 1882, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, submitting for acceptance by Your Excellency in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Act 1880, Section 37, Subsection 2, a Surrender, dated 9th February 1882, made to the Crown by the Chippewa, and Pottawatomie Indians of Walpole Island, of that portion of their Reserve known as \"St. Ann's Island\" and the marshes adjacent thereto, for the purpose of the same being leased for the benefit of said Indians to the \"St. Ann's Island Shooting and Fishing Club\" for shooting and fishing purposes, and in confirmation of a lease covering said premises issued by this Department on the 30th of May, 1881, to the aforesaid \"St. Ann's Island Shooting and Fishing Club\".\nThe Committee advise that the surrender be accepted and submit the same for Your Excellency's approval.\nIt followed that St. Ann's Island became \"Indian Land\", and in view of s. 51 of the Indian Act, could be leased or sold only with the approval of the Governor General in Council. This s. 51 reads as follows:\u2014\nAll Indian lands which are reserved or portions of reserves surrendered, or to be surrendered, to His Majesty, shall be deemed to be held for the same purpose as heretofore; and shall be managed, leased and sold as the Governor in Council directs, subject to the conditions of surrender and the provisions of this Part.\nIt is argued on behalf of the appellant that the effect of P.C. 529 is not only to accept the surrender of the lands to the Crown, and to confirm the original lease of May 1881, but also to authorize the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, to enter into further agreements with the appellant, as he did.\nI am unable to agree with this contention. When the Indians surrendered the lands to the end that said described territory may be leased to the applicants, * * * \"for such terms and conditions as the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs may consider best for our advantage * * *\", the lease with the appellant had then been signed, and the terms of the surrender indicate that its contents were known to all. The object of the surrender was to legalize what was rightly thought to be illegal, and to ratify what had been done. The same may be said of the Order in Council. But neither the authorization to the Superintendent in the surrender, nor P.C. 529 can be construed in my opinion as authorizing the Superintendent at the expiration of the lease, to enter into fresh agreements with the appellant nearly fifty years later, and in which can be found different conditions. When this lease came to an end, P.C. 529 which had authorized it, had served its particular purpose and a new one was therefore needed, in view of the imperative terms of s. 51, to vest in the Superintendent the necessary authority to lease these lands anew.\nIn view of the declaration of counsel for the appellant that he does not rely on the point raised in the court below, that the respondent is estopped from denying the validity of the tenancy of the claimant, it is unnecessary to deal with it.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rand and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.:\u2014The question in this appeal is whether what purports to be a lease executed by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs to the predecessor trustees of the appellant became binding on the Dominion Government. It was made in 1925 for the term of twenty years with an option for \"renewal leases * * * for successive periods of ten years\" and was the last of a succession between the same parties dating from 1881. It covers certain lands and waters within an Indain reservation, and was given primarily for fishing and hunting purposes, although not so expressly restricted.\nThe matter originated in a resolution passed on March 18, 1880, by the Indian Band Council authorizing the letting of what was known as St. Ann's Island to trustees for the St. Ann's Island Shooting and Fishing Club on terms approved by the Council, which was followed by a document signed by the Superintendent General dated May 30, 1881. The term was for five years from May 1, 1881; renewable for a like period; and it was provided that the lands and any buildings erected on them would at the \"end, expiration, or other determination\" of the lease or renewal be yielded up without any allowance being made for improvements.\nUnder the Indian Act of 1880, a surrender of the Indian interest was required before an effective lease could be made. On February 6, 1882, as a result of enquiries made by the lessees, at a meeting of the Band, an instrument was signed on its behalf which, after referring to the resolution of March 18, 1880, formally surrendered the lands to Her Majesty \"to the end that said described territory may be leased to the applicants for the purpose of shooting and fishing for such term and on such conditions as the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs may consider best for our advantage.\" Then following a recital that an executed lease had been read and explained, it declared approval of its terms and the confirmation of its execution by the Superintendent General.\nThe surrender was accepted by a minute of the Privy Council approved by the Governor General on April 3, 1882 (P.C. 529) as follows:\u2014\nOn a Memorandum, dated 7th March 1882, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, submitting for acceptance by Your Excellency in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Act, 1880, Section 37, Subsection 2, a Surrender, dated 9th February 1882, made to the Crown by the Chippewa and Pottawatomie Indians of Walpole Island, of that portion of their Reserve known as \"St. Ann's Island\" and the marshes adjacent thereto, for the purpose of the same being leased for the benefit of said Indians to the \"St. Ann's Island Shooting and Fishing Club\" for shooting and fishing purposes, and in confirmation of a lease covering said premises issued by this Department on the 30th of May, 1881, to the aforesaid \"St. Ann's Island Shooting and Fishing Club\".\nThe Committee advise that the surrender be accepted and submit the same for Your Excellency's approval.\nThe first lease was superseded by another executed in 1884, which in turn was followed by others in 1892, 1894, 1906, 1915 and finally by that now in question. In those of 1884 and 1892 there was no provision for renewal, but an option to renew for ten years was contained in the instruments of 1894, 1906 and 1915.\nSection 51, R.S.C. 1906, c. 81 (the Indian Act) provided:\u2014\nAll Indian lands which are reserved or portions of reserves surrendered, or to be surrendered, to His Majesty, shall be deemed to be held for the same purpose as heretofore; and shall be managed, leased and sold as the Governor in Council directs, subject to the conditions of surrender and the provisions of this Part.\nCameron J., before whom the Reference made by the Minister under s. 37 of the Exchequer Court Act, came, construed the surrender to be absolute but held that s. 51 required for the validity of the lease of 1925 that it should have been directed by the Governor in Council, and, as admittedly no other Order in Council than No. P.C. 529 of April 3, 1882 had been made, found it void.\nThe contention of the appellant is that the surrender was on the condition that the lands should thereafter be subject to a right of leasing by the trustees, on terms satisfactory to the Superintendent General, which, if not perpetual, would continue so long as the Superintendent General determined; that by acceptance of the surrender the condition became fixed and without more or by virtue of s. 64 of the Act, the Superintendent General became competent thereafter to deal with the lands in relation to the Club as he might consider for the benefit of the Band,\nI find myself unable to agree that there was a total and definitive surrender. What was intended was a surrender sufficient to enable a valid letting to be made to the trustees \"for such term and on such conditions\" as the Superintendent General might approve. It was at most a surrender to permit such leasing to them as might be made and continued, even though subject to the approval of the Superintendent General, by those having authority to do so. It was not a final and irrevocable commitment of the land to leasing for the benefit of the Indians, and much less to a leasing in perpetuity, or in the judgment of the Superintendent General, to the Club. To the Council, the Superintendent General stood for the government of which he was the representative. Upon the expiration of the holding by the Club, the reversion of the original privileges of the Indians fell into possession.\nThat there can be a partial surrender of the \"personal and usufructuary rights\" which the Indians enjoy is confirmed by the St. Catherine's Milling Company Limited v. The Queen 3, in which there was retained the privilege of hunting and fishing; and I see no distinction in principle, certainly in view of the nature of the interest held by the Indians and the object of the legislation, between a surrender of a portion of rights for all time and a surrender of all rights for a limited time.\nBut I agree that s. 51 requires a direction by the Governor in Council to a valid lease of Indian lands. The language of the statute embodies the accepted view that these aborigenes are, in effect, wards of the State, whose care and welfare are a political trust of the highest obligation. For that reason, every such dealing with their privileges must bear the imprint of governmental approval, and it would be beyond the power of the Governor in Council to transfer that responsibility to the Superintendent General.\nBut the circumstances here negative any delegation of authority. The Order in Council approved a lease for a definite period on certain stipulations; by its terms, it would come to an end, even with renewal, within ten years; and the efficacy of the Order was exhausted by that instrument.\nIt was argued that the Crown is estopped from challenging the lease, but there can be no estoppel in the face of an express provision of a statute; Gooderham & Worts Limited v. C.B.C. 4, and a fortiori where the legislation is designed to protect the interests of persons who are the special concern of Parliament. What must appear \u2014and the original trustees were well aware of it\u2014is that the lease was made under the direction of the Governor in Council, and the facts before us show that there was no such direction.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Blake, Anglin, Osier & Cassels.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.

The valuation must be made of the property as it stands and as used and occupied when the assessment is made.\nHeld: That the actual value of this building should be determined by giving to the percentage of the replacement cost, after allowing for the extra unnecessary costs of the construction, a figure of no more than 50 per cent.\nHeld: On principle, the non-productive features of a building, in so far as they do not add to its actual value ought not to be included among items in the determination of that value for municipal assessment.\nPer Kerwin J.: The formula used by the assessors, having failed to produce the actual value, should be disregarded and the commercial value only should be considered.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, reversing, St-Jacques and Casey J.A. dissenting, the judgment of the Superior Court, MacKinnon J., and confirming the municipal assessment made by respondent's Board of Revision.\nF. P. Brais, K.C., and H. Hansard, K.C., for the appellant.\nD. A. McDonald, K.C., and R. N. S\u00e9guin, K.C., for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014The subject matter of this appeal is the assessment for municipal purposes of the properties of the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada in the City of Montreal. While there may be recognized general principles concerning municipal valuations, yet the main concern of the Courts in this case is evidently to apply the several provisions of the charter of the City of Montreal having reference to the subject.\nSection 361 of the charter provides that all immovable property situate within the limits of the city shall be liable to taxation and assessment, with certain exceptions with which we are not concerned. It declares that immovable property shall comprise lands, buildings erected thereon, and everything so fixed or attached to any building or land as to form part thereof, but shall not include machinery, tools and shafting used for industrial purposes, except such as are employed for the purpose of producing or receiving motive power.\nUnder section 375(a) every three years the assessors shall draw up in duplicate for each ward of the city a new valuation roll for all the immovables in such ward, and this roll shall contain, amongst other things, the actual value of the immovables. However, whenever buildings or constructions erected upon an immovable entered in the previous roll have been changed or altered, or whenever a lot has been subdivided or divided, a new valuation of such property shall be made according to law and entered on the valuation roll by the assessors. The same section provides that at least two assessors shall act together in drawing up the valuation roll. The roll is deposited on the first of December. A public notice thereof is published and, during the delays fixed by the notice, the chief assessor is directed to receive complaints filed with him respecting any entries in the roll and to transmit them immediately to the Board of Revision.\nBy Section 382 a Board of Revision was created to be composed of three members appointed by Council on the report of the executive committee. The Board hears complaints at public meetings at which witnesses are called. The President decides questions of law. The Board may compel the appearance before it of one or several assessors in order to know in what manner and according to what principles they have proceeded to establish their valuations generally or in a particular case, or on what basis such valuations are founded, after which it may determine itself, or with the assistance of experts, the valuation in question; and, in so doing, it may increase, or reduce, or maintain, the valuation.\nBy force of section 384 of the charter an appeal lies from any decision rendered by the Board of Revision to any one of the judges of the Superior Court, by summary petition. The judge may order a copy of the record, including copies of the valuation certificate and of the documents annexed thereto\/of the proceedings of the Board of Revision, as well as of the complaint itself; and, after having heard the parties, but without inquiry, he must proceed with the revision of the valuation submitted to him and with the rendering of such judgment as to law and justice shall appertain.\nA further appeal lies from the decision of the judge of the Superior Court to the Court of King's Bench, when the amount of valuation contested for the property concerned exceeds five thousand dollars, or when the amount of the rental contested and under examination exceeds one thousand dollars.\nI only want to emphasize that, in the case of an appeal, the judge of the Superior Court, under the charter (sec. 384) shall render \"such judgment as to law and justice shall appertain.\" Although this is not repeated with reference to the decision which the Court of King's Bench must render, it cannot be understood to mean that such Court is not to be governed by the same direction as the judge of the Superior Court. If we carefully examine the judgment rendered by the Court of King's Bench 2 in the present instance, and the reasons given by the majority, I am of opinion, with respect, that, in the judgment appealed from, that direction of the charter of the City of Montreal has not been followed. That is apparent by the following consid\u00e9rant of the formal judgment:\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant, par cons\u00e9quent, que si la base d'une \u00e9valuation faite par le Bureau de revision n'est pas manifestement fausse; si le Bureau n'a pas commis d'erreur \u00e9vidente dans ses calculs, et que la m\u00e9thode suivie pour d\u00e9terminer la valeur n'a pas eu pour effet de cr\u00e9er une injustice certaine, ni le juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure ni la Cour du Banc du Roi ne devraient intervenir pour modifier la d\u00e9cision du Bureau.\nIt is also apparent throughout the reasons given by the learned judges who formed the majority.\nNow, of course, the principle embodied in the consid\u00e9rant, above reproduced, is the general principle followed in appeals from municipal assessments, but, as can be seen from the text of the charter, it is not the principle laid down by the latter. The Court of King's Bench professed to be governed by the general principle and applied it to the judgment it rendered and disregarded section 384 of the charter which prescribes, as we have seen, not that they ought not to interfere in the assessment only if the Board of Revision was manifestly wrong and had committed an evident error, or created a clear injustice, but that both the judge of the Superior Court and the judges of the Court of King's Bench should render \"such judgment as to law and justice shall appertain.\" It follows that the judgment now under appeal, in my humble opinion, was not rendered according to the law which governs the City of Montreal, and that, for that reason alone, it ought to be set aside.\nOn the other hand, the learned judge of the Superior Court undoubtedly followed the principle laid down in the charter as to the powers which he was entitled to exercise, to such an extent, as a matter of fact, that the majority of the Court of King's Bench found that he had been wrong in doing so.\nI need not insist on the point that a municipal valuation for assessment purposes is not to be made in accordance with the rules laid down with regard to the valuation of a property for expropriation purposes. One main ground why such a course should not be followed is that the expropriation of a property means the permanent divesting of the owner and should legitimately, therefore, take into account the present value and all the prospective possibilities of the property, while the municipal valuation is, generally speaking, only made for one year, or, in the case of the City of Montreal, for three years, with certain provisions for modification if certain events happen, such as alteration, improvement, fire, etc. The rule was laid down by Lord Parmoor in Great Western and Metropolitan Railway Companies v. Kensington Assessment Committee 3, that in such a case \"the hereditament should be valued as it stands and as used and occupied when the assessment is made.\" In the yearly valuation of a property for purposes of municipal assessment there is no room for hypothesis as regards the future of the property. The assessor should not look at past, or subsequent or potential values. His valuation must be based on conditions as he finds them at the date of the assessment. In particular, in the preent case, there was no ground for considering any other condition, as no suggestion of any kind appears in the record that there was, throughout the period of assessment, a prospect of any change. The Sun Life property, as it stood at the time of the valuation now in question, was occupied about sixty per cent by the company itself for its own purposes and about forty per cent by tenants. That is how the assessors found the property at the time they made their valuation, and that is the only aspect of the property that they had to take into consideration. If some material change took place during the three year period following the valuation, the charter of the City of Montreal provided for a fresh valuation taking into account those changes. Again, at the end of the three years, if the situation had been modified, there was then the opportunity to modify the valuation accordingly. But, for the valuation which had to be made and which is now the subject of the litigation, the property had to be taken as it stood then and as it was used and occupied.\nThe parties agreed on certain admissions showing the gross rental receipts for each tenant and each floor, including the basements, for the year 1941, being the material year. By these admissions the yearly rental actually charged to the company for the years 1937-1941 inclusive, as appears in the books of the Company, in the Company's annual statements and in statements supplied to the Superintendent of Insurance for the Dominion of Canada, for the floor space occupied by it per floor, was established. The amount shown, therefore, establishes the rental value for the year 1941, with which alone the assessors were concerned in their valuation. In turn, such rental value enables one to find the commercial value of the building, or, to adopt another expression which was used throughout the case, to estimate the price which a prudent investor would have been willing to give for the purchase of the property. An increase in rents in the City of Montreal might mean a higher rental value, but that would be the concern of the assessors who would have to render a decision at that time. For the moment, the assessors and the Court cannot be concerned with any other value than that of 1941. It is on such a basis that the judgment in this case must be arrived at.\nNow, it is evident from a reading of the record and the opinions expressed by the many experts who were heard, that there is far from being an agreement on the approach that should be made to reach a proper valuation in these matters. Some speak of market value, but there is a general consensus of opinion, in the circumstances, that this cannot form the basis of valuation here, as everybody, witnesses, experts, assessors, Board of Revision, judge of the Superior Court, and judges of the Court of King's Bench, state most positively that the Sun Life building now in question is unique and that there is no comparison between it and any other building in either the City of Montreal or the immediate vicinity. We were invited to apply certain dicta of a United States court in a judgment dealing with the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, in the State of Minnesota. I do not find it necessary to pause to consider such a judgment dealing with a property several thousand miles from the one which we are now considering. Counsel for the respondent in the case at bar stated several times in the course of his argument that one way to estimate the value of the Sun Life property would be to look at the valuation of comparable buildings. Of course, that should first mean comparable buildings in the City of Montreal, or the neighbouring country. But I have been so far unable to understand how a comparison of that kind could be helpful. It cannot assist the Court in reaching a conclusion because, of course, that would assume that the so-called comparable buildings have themselves been correctly valued by the assessors. And the Court really does not know anything about those buildings in that respect, more particularly because the owners of such buildings have not been heard in this case. At all events, the evidence is clearly to the effect that there is no building in Montreal comparable to that of the appellant. (Grampian Realties Co. v. Montreal East 4).\nMoreover, if there is one basis upon which we should be clear as to the method which should be followed for municipal valuation purposes, it is the one which is recognized by the assessors themselves in the memorandum prepared by them on the assessment of large properties. It states:\u2014\nEach property will have to be considered on its merits within the limits outlined above. The Board of Revision expresses the same view as follows:\u2014\nThe coupling of the word \"real\" with the word \"value\" indicates that real value is a fact, not an hypothesis. Because this conception of real value is overlooked or ignored, the means, the elements to determine the said real value are often taken for the value itself. Such elements are unlimited in number. They vary \"ad infinitum\" as the cases. There is no fixed rule to determine in what proportion every element must be taken into account and what importance should be given to any element in particular. The same element may have more importance in one case than in another. The law imposes on the asssessor the duty of finding the real value of an immoveable and of inscribing it on the roll, but does not in any way put any limit to the assessor's discretion in considering all the elements he thinks it advisable to consider in exercising his judgment and arriving at a decision.\nThe \"limits outlined above\", referred to in the memorandum of the assessors, (Ex. D-5) proceed to divide the properties such as office buildings, apartment houses, departmental stores, hotels, etc., into four main categories. They are as follows:\u2014\n(1) Properties that are developed and operated solely on a commercial basis as investment propositions.\n(2) Properties that are completely occupied by their owners.\n(3) Properties that are partly occupied by the owners and partly rented, among which the Sun Life property is specifically mentioned.\n(4) In a separate category all buildings like theatres and hotels.\nWith respect to the properties in the third category, of which the Sun Life is said to be one, the memorandum proceeds to state that these properties have been constructed or acquired as a permanent home for the enterprise of their owners, and that frequently the building is laid out for future development, the tenant situation being considered only temporary or incidental. In these cases, the memorandum continues, the owner is enjoying the full utility only of the space occupied by himself and is dependent on current rental conditions for the carrying charges on the balance of the building; and it is mentioned that some consideration should be given to the rental value in these cases, so that the replacement factor should be weighted somewhere between 50 and 100 per cent, and the commercial value factor make up the difference between 50 per cent and zero. Then the memorandum goes on to say:\u2014\nNo hard and fast rule can be given for the division of weight in these factors, as it will depend on the proportion owner-occupied, the extent to which the commercial features of the building have been sacrificed to the main design with a view to the future complete use of the building by the owner, or the enhanced prestige of an elaborate and expensive construction.\nAdmittedly such were the rules and the guiding principles followed by the assessors in the present case, and it is to that memorandum that we owe the idea embodied in the assessment herein of a certain percentage attributed to the replacement factor and another percentage attributed to the commercial value factor. In this instance the Board of Revision came to the conclusion, after a very complicated calculation, that the ratio of importance to be given to the net replacement cost should be 82.3 per cent and the ratio of the commercial value 17.7 per cent. Counsel for the respondent, in the course of the argument, was asked if a calculation of that kind for municipal valuation purposes was ever accepted in any Court of the province of Quebec and, of course, he could not point to any authority to that effect. Nevertheless, that was the yard-stick applied to the Sun Life property for its valuation by the Board of Revision.\nI do not think that it is the function of this Court, acting as third Appeal Court, to proceed to a detailed calculation of what the valuation should be. In that view I am fully in accord with the reasons for judgment of Casey J.A. in the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) 5, and I adopt his reasons. Like him, I think that \"the learned Justice of the Superior Court acted properly in intervening and in fixing the value of the Company's property, land and buildings at $10,207,877.00.\" I think the learned judge of the Superior Court succeeded in placing a true objective exchange value on the property and that the result he arrived at should be affirmed. As was said by Casey, J.A. the amount fixed by that Court more closely approaches the actual value of the property, as prescribed by the charter of the City of Montreal, and it should be allowed to stand.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed and the judgment of MacKinnon J. should be restored with costs both here and in the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) against the respondent. The award of costs by the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) on the appeal to that Court of the Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada should: not be disturbed.\nKerwin J.:\u2014This appeal is concerned with (1) the assessment by the City of Montreal of the appellant's main office building and what is called a secondary building, containing the heating plant; (2) the annual rental value of the two buildings for the purposes of business and water taxes.\nThe main question is the first and as to it there is no dispute as to the assessable value of the land itself. Article 375 of the charter of the City of Montreal provides for the preparation, every three years, by the assessors, of a valuation roll in each ward of all the \"immovables\", which expression includes lands and buildings. The roll is to contain \"the actual value of the immovables\" and the controversy turns upon the method of determining that value or, as it is put in the French version \"la valeur r\u00e9elle des dits immeubles\". The rule applicable in determining compensation in expropriation eases is not that to be followed in municipal assessment cases where the land and buildings are to be assessed at their value, or real value, or actual value. The test is an objective one which in many cases may be applied by seeking the exchange value or the value in a competitive market. If there is no such market, then one may ask what would a prudent investor pay for the subject of taxation, bearing in mind the return that might be expected upon the money invested.\nThe differences between the assessors and the Board of Revision need not be set out since the latter confirmed the amount of the assessment set by the former. Both, however, proceeded in the following manner: Taking the actual rents received by the Company and estimating the rents from other parts of the building available for tenants, and adding to that an estimate of what the Company should pay for the space occupied by itself, and deducting there-from the operating expenses, gives a net revenue which when capitalized resulted in a commercial value which may be taken as $7,028,623. The assessors and the Board then proceeded to fix the replacement cost of the buildings, which may be put at $13,387,131.80. Holding the view that there was no market and that both the replacement value and commercial value should be taken into consideration, it then became necessary, in their opinion, to take certain percentages of the above figures, which in the case of the assessors were put at 90 per cent of the assessed value and 10 per cent of the commercial value, and by the Board at 82.3 per cent and 17.7 per cent. The explanation of how the assessors arrived at their assessment appears in the evidence of one of them, Mr. Vernot, at page 556 of the Case, where he states:\u2014\nI think I will have to corroborate what Mr. Hulse said about the principles and methods agreed upon by the asssessors, and in commercial buildings, first, we agreed on 50 per cent replacement for strictly commercial buildings, and 50 per cent commercial value. When I say strictly commercial I mean a building designed and built for revenue purposes only.\nWhen you come into the owner occupied building and renting part of it, we would have to balance the part of the building assessed for commercial purposes and the part assessed as owner occupied. In the case of the Sun Life it was 40 per cent tenant occupied in 1941 and 60 per cent owner occupied. The occupied space. So that would mean that the 50 per cent for commercial would be divided into 20 and 60. There would be another 30 per cent replacement cost added on the 50, to make it 80 and 20.\nBut as the revenues in this building were based on revenues of much cheaper buildings\u2014the revenue of this building received no competition\u2014I consider that half of the commercial value of 20 per cent, making it 10 per cent, would pay for the amenities and benefits received by the owner of the building.\nOn appeal to the Superior Court, Mr. Justice MacKinnon while arriving at a different total for the replacement value, took 50 per cent of that total and 50 per cent of the commercial value in order to arrive at an amount of $10,207,877.40 for land and buildings. The majority of the Court of King's Bench 6 restored the order of the Board but Mr. Justice St. Jacques and Mr. Justice Casey dissented as they would have affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court. Casey J. decided that the commercial value was the proper method of approach and that the net rental revenue at which he arrived, $432,957, would represent a yield of approximately 4.2 per cent on the figure found by the Superior Court. He considered that in view of the evidence of Mr. Vernot that the rate should be 3 per cent for an owner occupied building and 4 1\/2 per cent for one that is tenant occupied, while Mr. Lobley and Mr. Simpson, for the Company, felt that a yield of 5 per cent was indicated, the figure of 4.2 per cent would not be far out of line. With those reasons and the result, I agree. While the Company sought to obtain a lower valuation on the basis of the evidence of its experts as to a possible purchaser, that evidence is not of such a character as to warrant it prevailing against the almost unanimous evidence of the commercial value.\nI have not overlooked the fact that in the Company's annual general statements and in its returns to the Superintendent of Insurance for Canada for the years 1914 to 1941 inclusive, sums of a like amount appeared under the headings \"book value\" and \"market value\", which represented actual cost less depreciation. Much was made by the respondent of this fact. Whatever bearing the figures might have when related either to the annual statements or the returns to the Superintendent of Insurance, they cannot, I think, affect the duty of the assessors and of the Board and of the Courts in fixing the value of the Company's immovables for the purposes of municipal taxation.\nThere remains the City's contention that the assessors and the Board of Revision proceeded In accordance with a memorandum adopted by the asessors at a meeting held at the suggestion of the Board, and that failure to adhere to that memorandum would result in discrimination. The assessors must, of course, proceed so as to cause no discrimination but it is also their duty to see that every ratepayer is assessed for its immovables at their actual value. Where it is demonstrated, as is the case here, that by attempting to use the formula of the memorandum the result arrived at is not such value, then the formula must be disregarded.\nAs to the second point in the appeal\u2014annual rental value\u2014the appellant has not convinced me that all the judges were wrong and that item should therefore stand. The appeal should be allowed to the extent indicated, with costs, and the judgment of MacKinnon J. restored. The appellant is entitled to its costs in the Court of King's Bench in the appeal of the City of Montreal, but should pay the costs of its own appeal in that Court; the cost of printing the case in the Court of King's Bench should be borne equally by both parties.\nTaschereau, J.:\u2014The appellant is the owner of a large office building situated on Dominion Square, in the City of Montreal and which occupies an entire city block from Metcalfe to Mansfield Streets on Dorchester Street. From Dorchester Street, it extends northward for approximately one half of a long city block. Part of this building is occupied by the Company itself as its head office, the remainder being rented on a commercial basis to a large number of business tenants.\nThe appellant is also the owner of a boiler house situated on Mansfield Street, where is located the heating apparatus. The office building and this boiler house, together with the emplacements whereon they are erected, were placed\" on the municipal valuation roll deposited by the assessors of the respondent on December 1st, 1941, at the respective valuation of $13,755,500 and $520,500. The appellant was also assessed in respect of its occupancy of the main building, at $423,280 for water tax purposes, and at $421,580 for business tax purposes. In the case of the boiler house, the assessment was placed at $26,000.\nThe appellant feeling that it was aggrieved by these valuations, appealed to the Board of Revision of the City of Montreal, and contended that the true and proper valuations of the said buildings should be $8,330,600 and $102,600 respectively. The valuations placed on the land in both cases (viz: $520,500 and $74,100) were not challenged, but the appellant also appealed regarding the assessed rental value for business tax, claiming that it should be reduced to $352,035. It also asked that the assessment of the rental value of the boiler house, fixed at $26,000, should disappear. During the hearing before the Board, the respondent submitted by counter-appeal that the combined assessment of the main building and boiler house should be increased to $15,651,100. The Board refused this increase, but maintained the assessment as made by the assessors, subject to consolidation of the boiler house assessment with that of the main building, with the result that the annual rental valuation of the boiler house disappeared. The Board also dismissed the complaint against the assessment of the annual rental value on the roll.\nThe appellant then appealed to the Superior Court, under the provisions of the City Charter. Mr. Justice Mackinnon sitting in that court, reduced the assessment of both properties, including land, to $10,207,877.40, but refused to disturb the Board's decision as to the annual rental value. He therefore allowed in part the appeal of the Company with costs against the City of Montreal.\nBoth parties then inscribed the case before the Court of King's Blench of the Province of Quebec 7, which, Messrs. Justices St-Jacques and Casey dissenting, allowed the appeal of the City of Montreal with costs, dismissed the appeal of the Company also with costs, and restored the decision given by the Board of Revision. The appellant now appeals to this Court.\nA brief account of the erection of this massive cubical designed building, which rises twenty-five storeys above the ground, is I think useful for a better understanding of this case. It was erected in three different stages. The first building, which now constitutes the southwest, or Dorchester and Metacalfe corner, was commenced in June, 1913, and completed in March, 1918. It was intended to be the head office of the Company. Although a comparatively small building of five or six storeys, occupying only one-sixth of the ground area of the present structure, it was made of very costly materials. The second stage of construction consisted in approximately doubling the size of the original building by extending it east, along Dorchester Street to Mansfield Street, and adding two storeys. This was commenced in the Summer of 1922 and finished in December, 1925. Finally the third stage, during which the great bulk of the existing structure was added, started in May, 1927, and it was only in December, 1930, that it was nearly all completed. Only a number of upper floors were not finished for occupancy by tenants at that time, nor completed until occupancy was from time to time, thereafter contracted for. At the time of the 1941 assessment, which is now in issue, approximately 14 per cent of the rentable space in the building was still unfinished and, therefore, unoccupied. Its cost up to April 30th, 1941, was $20,627,873.92, excluding the cost of the land and taxes and interest during construction, and the amount spent from April 30th, 1941, to December 1st of the same year, the date of the roll, was $58,713.70. The cost of the boiler house which was commenced in November, 1928, and ready in March, 1930, exclusive of the land and of interest and taxes during construction, was $709,257.14 plus $154 spent in 1938. The cost of the land, as given by the Company to the assessors, was $1,040,638.20. By adding together the above mentioned amounts, we come to a total of $22,436,636.96.\nIn 1930, the respondent's assessors placed these properties on the valuation roll of the City of Montreal for the tax year 1931-1932, at $12,400,000, but the present appellant appealed from such assessment to the full Board of Assessors under the provisions of the City Charter then in effect, and the appeal being allowed, the assessment was reduced to $8,000,000. During the ten years which followed, up to 1941, this figure of $8,000,000 was increased annually by amounts corresponding to the sums from time to time expended by the appellant on completion of interior floors as the same were occupied by tenants, and for the year immediately preceding the assessment now in issue, the property stood on the City valuation roll at $9,986,200 and it is from the sudden increase to $13,755,500 that the present appellant now complains. The assessment of the boiler house and land occupied by the appellant had likewise remained constant throughout the same period, at a total of $225,000 and by the assessment now under attack, this sum was increased to $520,500. These increases represent approximately 40 per cent for the office building and approximately 135 per cent for the boiler house. It must be noted that the land valuations were not increased, but on the contrary, slightly reduced, and it follows that the percentages of increase on the buildings as distinguished from the total included in the land, were even greater. The overall increase of the appellant's property affected by the assessment under attack was, therefore, of $4,064,000, and the overall assessment was $14,276,000.\nAt the same time, the annual rental value of the space occupied by the Company in its building, was increased from $357,280 to $423,280 for water tax purposes and $421,580 for business tax purposes. In 1940, before the valuation of the properties now in question was made, the assessors of the City of Montreal prepared a \"Memorandum\" laying down certain rules concerning the assessment of large properties in Montreal, as office buildings, apartment houses, departmental stores, hotels, etc. These properties were divided into four main categories in order to determine the relative importance of the various factors used in arriving at their valuation.\nThe category with which we are concerned, is the third, and it includes properties that are partly occupied by the owners and partly rented. The \"Memorandum\" indicates that in order to determine a proper valuation, the replacement and commercial values have to be taken into account, but the replacement factor should always be weighed somewhere between 50 per cent and 100 per cent, and the commercial factor between 50 per cent and zero. This \"Memorandum\" was produced as exhibit and with it was also produced a list of properties, the valuations of which have been made in accordance with those directions. It appears that in assessing the Sun Life Building, the assessors have thought that the replacement factor should be 90 per cent, and the commercial factor 10 per cent.\nMr. George E. Vernot was the City assessor who made the assessments now challenged. The method followed by Mr. Vernot to value the main property was the following:\u2014\nHe took the total cost of both properties as at the 30th of April, 1941, which as reported by the Company was $22,377,769.26. From this figure, he deducted the amounts paid for the erection of the boiler house, the construction of the sidewalks, the price paid for the land of both properties, the costs of the temporary partitions during the construction and of the parts demolished to connect the new buildings. These various amounts totalling $4,269,393.72 were then substracted from the total costs, leaving a balance of $19,108,375 for the main building alone, without the land. He then adjusted the cost of replacement to the 1941 figure, using the index of 1927-28-29-30, when most of the money was spent, and having found the difference to be $1,471,344 which he subtracted, he reached a figure of $17,637,031. He allowed 5 per cent for presumed extra cost, as the building was erected in three units, viz: $881,851, giving a balance of $16,755,180. He figured the depreciation at $3,081,202 and came to a final figure of $13,673,978 as being the cost of the main building in 1941, after depreciation and without the land.\nHis next operation was to add to this last figure $730,600 value of the land, giving a total replacement value of $14,404,578.\nThe commercial value of the property was also considered by Mr. Vernot. By capitalizing at a rate of 15 per cent, the total revenue of the property which he figured at $1,187,225, he thus gave to the property an economic value of $7,915,000.\nThen in order to apply the principles enunciated in the Memorandum, he reached the conclusion that the factor \"replacement value\" should be 90 per cent, and the commercial factor 10 per cent. By taking 90 per cent of $14,404,578, he obtained $12,964,120 and 10 per cent of $7,915,000, gave the figure of $791,500. His final operation was to add both these figures, subtract the value of the land, with the result that, in his opinion the \"real value\" of the main building alone, is $13,024,900, or $13,755,500 with the land. To this figure, he added the amount of the valuation of the boiler house, including the land, $520,500, making a grand total of $14,276,000.\nWhen the case was heard by the Board of Revision, Mr. Vernot explained as follows how he arrived at 90 per cent \"replacement\" and 10 per cent \"commercial\":\u2014\nWe decided that on the large buildings in our Wards that were rented, totally rented, we took into consideration 50 per cent commercial value and 50 per cent replacement value; that is where the building was built solely for commercial purposes and occupied solely for commercial purposes by tenants. Those that were occupied by owners we would take at 100 per cent replacement cost and nothing for commercial value. So the Sun Life happened to fall between these two categories. The total floor space occupied by the Sun Life and the tenants is given by their list and came out to be 60 per cent and 40 per cent.\nLater in his evidence, he added:\u2014\nQ. Can you give us some more particulars as to the proportion between the 90 and 10? Do you conclude that 90 per cent must be given to replacement cost and 10 per cent to the commercial?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Why not 15 and 85, or 20 and 80? You could give me some explanations?\u2014A. I think I will have to corroborate what Mr. Hulse said about the principles and methods agreed upon by the assessors, and in commercial buildings, first, we agreed on 50 per cent replacement for strict commercial buildings, and 50 per cent commercial value. When I say strictly commercial I mean a building designed and built for revenue purposes only. When you come into the owner occupied building and renting part of it, we would have to balance the part of the building assessed for commercial purposes and the part assessed as owner occupied. In the case of the Sun Life it was 40 per cent tenant occupied in 1941 and 60 per cent owner occupied. The occupied space. So that would mean that the 50 per cent for commercial would be divided into 20 and 60. There would be another 30 per cent replacement cost added on to the 50, to make it 80 and 20.\nBut as the revenues in this building were based on revenues of much cheaper buildings\u2014the revenue of this building received no competition\u2014I consider that half of the commercial value of 20 per cent, making it 10 per cent, would pay for the amenities and benefits received by the owner of the building.\nThe members of the Board of Revision accepted the method adopted by the assessors, but reached a higher figure because they reduced the adjustment cost to the index number 1939-40, and reduced also the amount of depreciation. They also applied the formula indicated in the \"Memorandum\" to the boiler house, which was dealt with separately by the assessors. They thought however that the \"replacement\" factor should be 82.3 per cent and the \"commercial\" factor 17.7 per cent. On account of these slight differences, they came to the final conclusion that the \"real value\" of both properties was $15,051,977.07, and that therefore, the valuation made by the assessors, viz: $14,276,000 was not excessive.\nIn the Superior Court, Mr. Justice Mackinnon agreed with many of the figures arrived at by the assessors. He however slightly reduced the depreciation on the building, but thought that a further depreciation of 14 per cent, viz: $2,352,932.70, should also be subtracted from the 1941 net cost of the building, being for extra unnecessary costs for granite, monumental work, ornamental stones, bronze sash, bronze doors, etc., as explained by the witnesses Perry, Mills and D\u00e9saulniers. He therefore reached the conclusion that the replacement value of the main building was $12,100,786.80 and after adding to this figure, the value of the land, viz: $730,600, plus the value of the boiler house and land, viz: $535,735, he arrived at a total replacement value of $13,387,131.80.\nMr. Justice Mackinnon expressed the view that both the replacement value and the commercial value should be considered, but that each should be given equal consideration, that the \"actual value\" should be 50 per cent of the replacement value, plus 50 per cent of the com- mercial value. He capitalized the net revenue of $752,062.66 at 10.7 per cent which equalled $7,028,623. Adding this last figure to the replacement value, as found by him, and dividing by 50 per cent, he concluded that the real value of both properties including the land, was $10,207,877.40.\nThen, the Court of King's Bench (1), to whom both parties appealed, considered the case. The majority found that the valuation of immovables is an operation which requires technical knowledge and an experience that can be found only with specialists in the matter, and that if a valuation made by a Board of Revision composed of experts, is not manifestly wrong, does not contain obvious errors in its figures, if the method followed to determine the value of the property did not cause a manifest injustice, neither a Judge of the Superior Court nor a Court of Appeal should intervene to modify the conclusion arrived at by the Board.\nThe Court 8 held that, for the proper determination of the real value of immovables one must take into account 1\u00b0 the indicia of the market, 2\u00b0 the replacement value, 3\u00b0 the economic value of the immovable, by capitalizing the revenues that it is susceptible of producing. The Court said that it was impossible to give to the Sun Life Building a market value, because such a building has no market, there being no seller and no purchaser, and that the safest way to come to a proper conclusion is to take into account the replacement value and the economic value. The Court thought that the Board had made no error in choosing these two factors to determine the real value, and it concluded by saying that, the Board having weighted all the elements of the problem that was submitted to it, the decision to apportion 82.3 per cent to the replacement value and 17.7 per cent to the economic value, should not have been disturbed.\nThe Court, therefore, dismissed the appeal of the Sun Life Assurance Company with costs, maintained with costs the appeal of the City of Montreal, and confirmed the judgment given by the Board, Mr. Justice St-Jacques and Casey dissenting.\nThis building has been rightly described as monumental and unique. Its external appearance, with its ornamental columns and balustrades, its granite walls, bronze doors, the lavishness of the interior decorations, the unsparing use of marble and other expensive materials, the vastness of its rooms, its cafeterias, gymnasiums, elevators, etc., all contribute to make of this building one of the most sumptuous in the City of Montreal. For the same reasons, however, it is undoubtedly one of the least economical office buildings, and at the same time, one on which it is not easy to place a municipal valuation, and give to it a \"real\" or \"actual\" value.\nThe Charter of the City of Montreal, Art. 375, provides:\u2014\nEvery three years, the assessors shall draw up in duplicate for each Ward of the City a new valuation roll for all the immovables in such Ward. Such roll shall be completed and deposited on or before the 1st of December, after having been signed by the Chief Assessor\nThis roll and each of the supplementary rolls mentioned in paragraph b, shall contain:\u2014\n3\u00b0 The actual value of the immovables.\nIt is admitted that the words \"real value\" and \"actual value\" are interchangeable, and as Sir Lyman Duff, then C.J., said in Montreal Island v. The Town of Laval des Rapides 9:\u2014\nObviously, \"real value\" and \"actual value\" are regarded by the Legislature as convertible expressions.\nBut for the purpose of municipal valuation, they do not have the same meaning as the one attributed to them in expropriation cases, and therefore the necessary distinction must be kept in mind. In expropriation matters, \"real value\" means \"value to the owner\", which is not the case in municipal valuation. In Pastoral Finance Association Ltd. v. The Minister 10, Lord Moulton who was there dealing with an expropriation case, enunciated the following formula:\u2014\nThe owner is entitled to that which a prudent man in his position would have been willing to give for the land sooner than fail to obtain it.\nDiscussing this formula in Montreal Island Power Co. v. The Town of Laval des Rapides (cited supra), at page 307 Sir Lyman Duff expressed the following views:\u2014\nThere is no room for the application of any such formula in the administration of an assessment act, because the amount ascertained under the formula depends upon the special position of the owner with regard to the land. And on the same page he added:\u2014\nIn the case of expropriation, the rule is undisputed. The person whose property is taken is entitled to be compensated for the loss he has suffered by being deprived of his land compulsorily; the value of the land, for ascertaining such compensation, is the value of the land to him.\nSee also Diggon-Hibben Ltd. v. His Majesty the King 11.\nIn Cedars Rapids v. Lacoste 12, Lord Dunedin, speaking for the Judicial Committee, also in an expropriation case said:\u2014\nFor the present purpose it may be sufficient to state two brief propositions: (1) the value to be paid for is the value to the owner as it' existed at the date of the taking, not the value to the taker. (2) the value to the owner consists in all advantages which the land possesses, present or future, but it is the present value alone of such advantages that falls to be determined.\nThe reason for this rule is obvious, and I do not think I can put it more clearly than Mr. Justice Hodgins in Ontario & Minnesota Power Co. v. The Town of Fort Frances 13:\u2014\n* * * * the fact that the municipality appraises the land each year as it then is, and in that way gets the benefit, from time to time, of each realized possibility as it occurs, must be considered. The reason for the rule in compensation cases that \"all advantages which the land possesses, present or future,\" must be paid for, is that the land is finally taken, and the owner loses both those present and future advantages, and the taker gets them.\nIt naturally follows that a building may for municipal purposes, be valued at a much lower amount than the amount of the compensation its owner would be entitled to if expropriated. In the latter case, the \"value to the owner\" would be considered, but ignored in the former.\nIn order to reach a proper conclusion in a case of municipal assessment, it is the \"real value\" that has therefore to be considered. As in many other statutes, these words are not defined in the Charter of the City of Montreal, but they have been the subject of many judicial pronouncements. It is settled law I think, that they mean what the building will command in terms of money in the open market.\nIn Lord Advocate v. Earl of Home 14, Lord MacLaren said:\u2014\nIt means exchangeable value\u2014the price the subject will bring when exposed to the test of competition. In Grierson v. City of Edmonton 15, Sir Charles Fitz-patrick, C.J., with whom all the Members of this Court concurred, said:\u2014\nSpeaking generally, the intrinsic value of a piece of property must necessarily be the price which it will command in the open market.\nIn Gouin v. The City of St. Lambert 16, it was held:\u2014\nLa valeur r\u00e9elle que vise la loi des cit\u00e9s et villes (art. 485) quant aux immeubles imposables d'une municipalit\u00e9 urbaine consiste dans leur valeur v\u00e9nale \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de la confection du r\u00f4le d'\u00e9valuation par les estimateurs.\nAt page 219, Mr. Justice Archambault says:\u2014\nLe sens des mots \"valeur r\u00e9elle\" de l'article 485 de notre Loi des Cit\u00e9s et Villes est fix\u00e9 par la doctrine et la jurisprudence. Les mots \"valeur r\u00e9elle\" signifient \"valeur actuelle\", \"valeur marchande\".\nIn Bishop of Victoria v. City of Victoria 17, the British Columbia Court of Appeal decided:\u2014\nUnder section 212, para. 1, of the British Columbia Municipal Act, for assessment purposes, the term \"actual value\" means value in exchange, that is, what a prudent man of business, taking into consideration the reversible currents which affect the value of land would be likely to pay for a property of the character under assessment.\nThe respondent itself accepts these views, and in its factum also agrees with the \"willing buyer\" and \"willing seller\" formula, which has often been recognized by the courts, and cites the case of La Compagnie d'Approvisionnement d'Eau v. La Ville de Montmagny 18, where Mr. Justice Pelletier said:\u2014\nDans la cause du Roi v. MacPherson (10 Exch. Ct. Rep. 208), je trouve une d\u00e9finition donn\u00e9e par le juge Cassels de la Cour d'Echiquier qui me para\u00eet excellente. Voici cette d\u00e9finition: \"C'est le prix qu'un vendeur qui n'est pas oblig\u00e9 de vendre et qui n'est pas d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9 malgr\u00e9 lui, mais qui d\u00e9sire vendre r\u00e9ussira \u00e0 avoir d'un acheteur qui n'est pas oblig\u00e9 d'acheter, mais qui d\u00e9sire acheter.\nI may also add the following authority\u2014In Lacroix v. City of Montreal 19, Bruneau J., said at page 130:\u2014\nLa valeur actuelle \u00e0 laquelle les estimateurs de la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al sont tenus d'\u00e9valuer les immeubles doit s'entendre de la valeur v\u00e9nale savoir, celle que le propri\u00e9taire pourrait obtenir pour sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, d'un acheteur qui, sans y \u00eatre oblig\u00e9, d\u00e9sirerait en faire l'acquisition.\nIn order to find this \"actual value\" it is of course, as Mr. Justice Mackinnon and the Court of Appeal have said, quite in order for the assessors to consider various elements as recent free sales of identical or comparable properties, the depreciated replacement cost, the economic value of the property itself. The first of these approaches cannot be considered in this case; the Sun Life Building being in a class by itself, no sales of identical or comparable buildings have taken place, and I therefore agree with the courts below, that the two last approaches only can help to come to a proper conclusion.\nDealing first of all with the replacement value, I think there are considerations that have to be kept in mind, and which apply particularly in this present case. Although this method of valuation for municipal purposes is of frequent use, there are cases where it would be dangerous to attach to it too much importance, in view of the particular circumstances which may arise. I do not disagree with the method recommended in the \"Memorandum\", when of course no other indicia are available, but the rule must not be too rigid. It must have enough flexibility so that it may be applied to certain exceptional cases, as for instance the one with which we are now dealing. Otherwise, a manifest injustice would be the inevitable result. It is not always, although it might happen, that the \"market value\" or the \"exchangeable value\" of a building is represented by the amount of the investment made by the owner less depreciation. Some investments are. good, some others are not, and certain features of an expensive building may contribute considerably to reduce its \"market value.\"\nWhat I have said previously of the Sun Life Building as to its most expensive construction, is sufficient, I believe, to show that its \"replacement value\" placed in the books of the Company at $16,258,050 in 1941, is not the figure that a \"prudent investor\" would consider in trying to determine its \"real value\". He would obviously disregard many of its amenities and luxuries, thinking rightly that they are superfluous and not productive of a proportionate return.\nThis amount of $16,258,050 which the Company showed in its books as being the value of the property, and which in the relevant year appeared in its annual statement furnished to the Superintendent of Insurance, does not represent the \"real value\" of the property for \"assessment pur- poses.\" It merely shows the amount of ' money spent in the circumstances already mentioned, with the ordinary annual depreciation. It indicates to the shareholders and to the Superintendent of Insurance how the funds of the Company were invested, but it surely does not reveal all-the elements of the \"replacement value\", which has to be considered with the \"economic value\".\nThe proper method to be followed in order to determine the replacement value of a building, is first of all to ascertain the cost of construction, to adjust that cost to the index figure of the year when the valuation is made, then to deduct a reasonable amount for depreciation, and in certain exceptional cases a further amount on account of the special features of the building, keeping always in mind that the \"replacement value\" is one of the important factors that must be considered in the determination of the \"real\" or \"market value\". Expressing in a different form what I have said previously, it would be quite impossible to determine what the building will command in terms of money, if too expensive materials, sumptuous decorations and luxuries are value at their cost price. There must necessarily be an allowance for those special items, the value of which is not commensurate with their cost.\nThe assessors, the Board of Revision and the Court of King's Bench have refused to allow any reduction for such items as granite, ornamental work, marble floors and walls, etc., which Mr. Justice Mackinnon believes could have been replaced by less expensive materials, as explained by witnesses Perry, Mills and D\u00e9saulniers. He therefore, and with this view I fully concur, allowed a further depreciation of 14 per cent for those extra unnecessary costs, which do not add to the \"real value\" of the property. This additional depreciation amounted to $2,352,932.70. By doing so, he followed the judgment delivered by the U.S. District Court of Minnesota in Federal Reserve Bank v. The State of Minnesota. This case, of course, is not a binding authority, but an expression of opinion with which I entirely agree. The judgment, after referring to the building of the Federal Reserve Bank, as a \"fortress\", said:\u2014\n* * * * in substantiation of his estimate of the true market as contemplated by the Statute he figured the reproduction cost of the building as of May 1, 1936 to be $2,600,000. He allowed 25 per cent 60877\u20143 1\/2 depreciation, being approximately 2 per cent per year for the life of the building and by reason of the apparent difference of opinion as to the effect of the distinctive architecture on its market value both artistically and as a utilitarian structure, he allowed an additional 25 per cent for depreciation. Therefore a total of 50 per cent depreciation is to be. found in the Assessor's computation.\nThe judgment also reads:\u2014\nFurthermore, it appears that due consideration and allowance have been given by the assessor on\" account of the architectural and structural limitations that may exist in this building.\nI also agree with the other figures arrived at by Mr. Justice Mackinnon, which are not materially different from those of the assessors and of the Board of Revision. I therefore accept his finding that the \"replacement value\" of the building is $12,100,796.80.\nTurning now to the commercial value of the property, it is necessary to consider its gross revenue and its operating expenses. The Board of Revision and Mr. Justice Mackinnon both accept the same figures, viz: Total gross revenue $1,189,055.30 and operating expenses $436,992.64, leaving a net revenue of $752,062.66. After having capitalized this net revenue, they all came to the conclusion that the commercial value of the building, at the relevant date, was $7,028,623, and I find no satisfactory reason why this amount should be changed.\nThe \"replacement value\" and the \"economic value\" having been ascertained, it now remains to determine what consideration should be given to each element. The assessors thought that 90 per cent and 10 per cent were the right figures, while the Board was of the opinion that 82.3 per cent and 17.7 per cent should be adopted. Mr. Justice Mackinnon gave to each factor an equal importance of 50 per cent. It is not an easy task to reach mathematically the exact figure in such a matter, but I have no hesitation in reaching the conclusion that the assessors and the Board have given too much weight to the \"replacement\" factor. Having in mind that the test of \"real or actual value\" lies in the exchangeability of the property, I believe that the \"prudent investor\" would particularly be concerned with the \"economic value\" of the building, in order to get a fair return on his money.\nThe \"real value\" is the \"market value\" or the \"value in exchange\", and in order to ascertain it, one must neces- sarily, even if there has been no sale of the building, try and find what would be the price of the building in the open market. The rule is not that because there is no buyer and no seller, as in the present case, the well-known theory of \"willing buyer and willing seller\" does not apply. We must ask ourselves this question: What would occur if there was a buyer and a seller? In Lacoste v. Cedar Rapids 20, Lord Warrington speaking for the Judicial Committee said at page 285:\u2014\nBut the proper amount to be awarded in such a case cannot be fixed with mathematical certainty but must be largely a matter of conjecture. It is the price likely to be obtained at an imaginary sale, the bidders at which are assumed to ignore the fact that a definite scheme of exploitation has been formed and compulsory powers obtained for carrying it into effect.\nI do not agree with the Board of Revision when it says that this case does not apply. True, this was an expropriation case, but the principle of an imaginary sale may as well help to determine the real value of a building, as it does when the courts have to value the future advantages of a water power. Moreover, several witnesses heard before the Board are clearly of opinion that it is quite possible to imagine a market for the property, and that it is a commercial building (Simpson, MacRosie, Archambault, Lobley).\nUnder these circumstances, I am satisfied that the assessors and the Board have considerably undervalued the \"economic factor\" which, in a very large measure, would guide the \"prudent investor\" or \"the willing buyer\", always anxious to obtain \"value in exchange\" for his money. I believe that a proportion of at least 50 per cent should be attributed to it, although the replacement value has already been reduced by 14 per cent.\nAs I do not think that there has been any substantial error in the valuation of the boiler house, the figures should not be altered.\nIt follows that if we add to the replacement value of the building, viz: $12,100,796.80, the value of the land which is not challenged $730,600 and $555,735, the value of the boiler house and land, we have a total replacement value of $13,387,131.80. This figure added to the economic value, viz: $7,028,623, will give $20,415,754.80, which divided by 50 per cent, will equal the \"market value\" of the property, viz: $10,207,877.40. This amount is $2,207,-877.40 higher than the valuation given to the same premises in 1931-32, by the respondent's Board of Assessors.\nIn coming to this conclusion, I have kept in mind that it is not the function of a Court of Appeal to disturb the valuations made by assessors. But in certain cases it is its duty to do so, particularly when the assessors have proceeded on a wrong principle, and when there is a manifest injustice. Here in refusing to allow an additional 14 per cent for extra unnecessary costs, and in giving a disproportionate consideration to the replacement value, they justified this Court to interfere.\nAfter having carefully read the evidence, I have come to the conclusion that there is no justification to modify the judgment of the court below as to the complaint that the annual rental value is too high.\nI would allow the appeal wtih costs, and restore the judgment of Mr. Justice Mackinnon. The appellant should also be entitled to its costs in the Court of King's Bench in the appeal of the City of Montreal, but should pay the costs of its own appeal in that Court; the cost of printing the case in the Court of King's Bench should be borne equally by both parties.\nRand, J.:\u2014This appeal raises the question of the basis of valuation and its application for assessment purposes of the large building in Montreal owned by the Sun Life Assurance Company.\nFor property designed for business or ordinary private purposes, it is, I think, settled, that, as stated by Duff, C.J., in Montreal Island Power v. Laval des Rapides 21, \"actual value\" in article 375 of the charter of Montreal means exchange value, the value actually or theoretically ascertained by the test of competition between a free and willing purchaser and a like vendor. It seems quite evident that the draftsman of the article had not fully explored the conception of \"actual value\", and in spite of the controversy to which these words have given rise, they remain the legislative language of value for tax assessments. The legislature, in other words, has left it to the courts through experience with the many forms in which. property value presents itself, to develop a formula which, adaptable to the generality of property, will produce a rough fairness and uniformity.\nIn the ordinary case, a commercial building constructed with due regard to the necessary relation between cost and utility presents little trouble whether the exchange value is arrived at by capitalizing revenue or by depreciated reproduction: there are no elements of cost not reflected in competitive value. There may be values imbedded in special features or conditions, but unless they are reflected in exchange value they must be eliminated in its ascertainment.\nThat value may thus become a highly theoretical conception; for assessment purposes, it is, in any case, an approximation; but in the practical administration of local government, the impact on the individual owner is lessened by the uniformity of the mode and by the small fraction of challenged differences in assessments which reaches him in the tax levied. But notwithstanding that fact, a formula suitable even for substantially the whole body of property must possess a flexibility sufficient to adjust the measure to exceptional features.\nAdmittedly a great deal of money has been expended in exceptional form in the building in question. It is monumental in design and massive in dimensions, and is seemingly intended to symbolize a business position of commanding power; but it is essentially an office building. The floor space is used both by the company and by tenants, of which approximately 50 per cent is occupied by the company, about 38 per cent is under lease, and the remainder unoccupied. Its total cost, as built in three stages between 1914 and 1930, though still not fully completed, was somewhat over $20,000,000. It is marketable only to a limited number of purchasers; the highest bidder would be one for whom the special features had the greatest attraction; the most likely buyers would be investors in office buildings, for whom the funded excess or uneconomic surplus would be written off. The potential market would thus present competition between investing groups and bids in the course of time of persons having purposes in mind more or less similar to those of the appellant.\nIn the theoretical market which, by the necessities of the case, must be constructed, competition in some form is essential. The case of Vyricherla v. Revenue Officer 22, although one of expropriation, illustrates one of its difficult aspects. The possibilities of buyers, sellers and properties is to be conceived in all manner and degrees. It is said by the respondent that, in an imagined sale, as the company would concede value to the total expenditure, it would, accordingly, be willing to pay the entire reproduction cost. But that ignores the test. The company, as bidder, would be influenced by the fact that there would likely be no other immediately available bidder with similar purposes in mind and it would drive the price down to the point at which the. possibilities of owner bidders of diminishing interests or investment buyers would induce the seller to hold his property: both owners and investors could properly regard the value for the other secondary object as a reserved interest in their purchase.\nThe Assessment Department, in developing a working basis of valuation of general uniformity, in 1940 drew up a memorandum containing three directions to guide the assessors. Where the commercial building was occupied by the owner and no special characters present, the depreciated original or reproduction cost was to be taken as actual value; where the building was occupied by 'tenants, one-half of reproduction was to be added to one-half of the capitalization of income; and where occupied in part by owner and in part by tenants the former portion was to be treated as in the first case and the latter as in the second, with the percentage attributable to capitalization to range from 50 per cent to zero. Allowance was to be made for unusual factors by means of the percentages applied.\nAs exemplified here, the building being in the third class and as to 60 per cent of its available space, deemed occupied by the owner, the first figure would be the reproduction of that 60 per cent; the second would result from the division of the 40 per cent into fractions representing reproduction and capitalization. The assessor attributed first one-half of the 40 per cent to reproduction but by reason of the special enjoyment of the unique elements by the company, divided the remainder, 20 per cent, into one-half to reproduction and one-half to capitalization. In the result, 90 per cent of reproduction and 10 per cent of capitalization produced the assessed valuation. Reproduction cost together with the land but exclusive of the power plant on a nearby site, was found to be $14,404,578,90 per cent of which is $12,964,120; capitalization was $7,915,000 which at 10 per cent gave $791,500; total actual value $13,755,500.\nFor the purchase of the building as an investment for business offices, the price would admittedly range between $7,500,000 and $8,000,000.\nAlthough the latter would be the most likely object of purchase, the appellant does not ask us to take it alone as the determinant of exchange value. There are always the possible purchases for owner purposes, on the chance of which, rather than a sale solely on an income basis, the company would no doubt put a not inconsiderable value. The gradation of increasing possibilities of purchasers with lessening degrees of interest would extend to the purely investment basis; and the crux of the problem would be in estimating the present value of those possibilities.\nThe error of the, assessment made lies in the fact that actual value has been virtually identified with value to the owner. That is clear from the influence on the percentage applied to construction cost of the special features as owner interests. Although the rule in expropriation would take their peculiar value to the owner into account as the assessor has done, that rule has no place in assessment: Montreal Island v. Laval des Rapides (supra) at p. 307. For the purposes here, those values must be subjected to the competitive test.\nOn the foregoing basis and taking the reproduction cost accepted by the Superior Court at $14,453,729.50, there would be deducted from it what is dead value for any purpose, such as differences in cost between marble and terrazzo flooring, between marble and plaster walls, and excessive decorative and ornamental work, which, as adjusted by McKinnon, J., is $2,352,932.70. To the remainder there would be added $730,000, the value of the land, and $535,735, the value of the heating plant: a total of $13,367,131. Placing the commercial value at the sum of $7,750,000, there remain the percentages to be applied to these two amounts.\nAs already stated the assessor attributed 90 per cent to reconstruction cost and 10 per cent to capitalization. The modification in this made by the Board of Review was on the basis of estimated rentals, rather than space, 65 per cent of which was imputed to the company and 35 per cent to lessees. Adding to the 65 per cent one-half of the 35 per cent gave 82.5 per cent to be attributed to reproduction value and 17.5 per cent to capitalization. This on an increased reproduction cost produced a figure somewhat higher than that of the assessor, but the latter was allowed to stand.\nHaving regard to the whole group of possible purchasers, the weight to be attributed to the one or other primary basis of price must depend upon the likelihood of their appearance as bidders. A heavy demand from prospective owners and few commercial investors would call for a correspondingly small percentage to be referred to the latter basis; when these proportions are reversed, as here, a like reversal of percentages becomes necessary.\nMcKinnon, J., was of the opinion that an equal percentage should be applied to each factor, but even with the deduction of surplus expenditure, that does not seem to me to reflect sufficiently the relative possibilities. Taking into consideration all special elements such as functional depreciation and obsolescence, and the comparative chances of sale, I should say that not less than 55 per cent should be related to the commercial figure and 45 per cent to that of reproduction cost. The former yields $4,262,500 and the latter $6,015,208.95, a total of $10,277,708.95. As this is substantially the amount found by McKinnon, J., I accept his figure as the proper valuation. In agreement with him I would allow the assessment of the power house and those in respect of both the business and school taxes to stand as confirmed by the Board of Review.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed and the judgment of McKinnon, J., restored; the appellant should have its costs here and in the Court of King's Bench.\nEstey, J.:\u2014The appellant's main contentions are that the assessment dated December 1, 1941, upon the Sun Life building in Montreal is erroneous: (1) That the plan or method adopted by the assessors did not determine the actual value as required by the Charter of the City of Montreal, and (2) Certain allowances or deductions were improperly disallowed.\nThe assessment made by the assessors of land and building at $14,276,000 was affirmed by the Board of Revision, reduced by Mr. Justice Mackinnon in the Superior Court to $10,207,877.40, and restored by a majority of the learned Judges in the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) 23, Mr. Justice St. Jacques and Mr. Justice Casey dissenting.\nThe issues in this appeal are restricted to the assessment of the building, there being here no contest with respect to the assessment of the land.\nThe assessors determined what they called the commercial value by ascertaining the net rental revenue of the building and capitalizing that amount; and the replacement value by making certain deductions for depreciation and other items from the cost of construction and the adjustment of the cost to the index number 1939-40. Then by apportioning these two amounts on the basis of 90 per cent replacement valuation and 10 per cent commercial valuation they arrived at the actual value. The Board of Revision suggested slight changes might have been made in certain items as well as the percentages in the apportionment but in the end affirmed the decision of the assessors. Mr. Justice Mackinnon allowed a further deduction for extra unnecessary costs and considered that both of these valuations should be given equal consideration as follows:\u2014\n50 per cent of replacement value of $13,387,131.80 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 $ 6,693,565.90\n50 per cent of commercial value of $7,028,623.00 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 3,514,311.50\nReal value of both properties\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026 $10,207,877.40\nThe appellant submits that this plan or method is not justified within the meaning of the Charter of the City of Montreal.\nThe assessors under the Charter of the City of Montreal, 62 Vict., c. 58, as amended by S. of Q. 1941, c. 73, s. 33, are required to determine the actual value of the immovables.\n375\u2014a. Every three years the assessors shall draw up in duplicate for each ward of the city a new valuation roll for all immovables in such ward\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nThis roll and each of the supplementary rolls mentioned in paragraph b shall contain:\u2014\n3. The actual value of the immovables. The term \"actual value\" is not defined in the Charter. The legislature therefore in imposing upon the assessors the duty of determining actual value, without defining that term, intended that the assessors should accept the meaning of that phrase as it has been interpreted by the Courts in decisions respecting assessments. Chief Justice Duff in construing the phrase \"actual value\" in The Cities and Towns Act, R.S.Q. 1925, c. 102, stated in Montreal Island Power Co. v. The Town of Laval des Rapides 24 at p. 305:\u2014\nObviously, \"real value\" and \"actual value\" are regarded by the legislature as convertible expressions. The construction of these phrases does not, I think, present any difficulty. The meaning of \"actual value\", when used in a legal instrument, subject, of course, to any controlling context, is indicated by the following passage from the judgment of Lord MacLaren in Lord Advocate v. Earl of Home (1891) 28 Sc.L.R. 289, at p. 293:\u2014\nNow, the word \"value\" may have different meanings, like many other words in common use, according as it is used in pure literature, or in a business communication or in conversation. But I think that \"value\" when it occurs in a contract has a perfectly definite and known meaning unless there be something in the contract itself to suggest a meaning different from the ordinary meaning. It means exchangeable value\u2014the price which the subject will bring when exposed to the test of competition.\nWhen used for the purpose of defining the valuation of property for taxation purposes, the courts have, in this country, and, generally speaking. on this continent, accepted this view of the term \"value\".\nAnd at p. 307:\u2014\nThese assessment provisions, like other assessment provisions, contemplate an objective standard which can be applied with fairly reasonable uniformity to all classes of owners alike.\nMr. Justice Pelletier in Compagnie d'Approvisionnement d'Eau v. Ville de Montmagny 25, stated at p. 418:\u2014\nDans la cause du Roi v. Macpherson, 1 Exch. Ct. Rep. p. 53, je trouve une d\u00e9finition donn\u00e9e par le juge Cassels de la Cour d'\u00e9chiquier qui me para\u00eet excellente. Voici cette d\u00e9finition: \"c'est le prix qu'un vendeur qui n'est pas oblig\u00e9 de vendre et qui n'est pas d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9 malgr\u00e9 lui, mais qui d\u00e9sire vendre r\u00e9ussira \u00e0 avoir d'un acheteur qui n'est pas oblig\u00e9 d'acheter, mais qui d\u00e9sire acheter\".\nActual value must be, except where there is a market in which the exchange value may be ascertained, a matter of judgment exercised after determining every item that affects the value of the particular immovable under consideration. The Bishop of Victoria v. City of Victoria 26; Massachusetts General Hospital v. Belmont 27. In the American and English Ency. of Law, Vol. 27, p. 690, it is stated:\u2014\nThe advantages and disadvantages of location, earning capacity, cost of construction, market price, or other elements which enter into and constitute the value of property, should be considered by the assessing officers in arriving at their determination. The method to be followed and the elements of value to be taken into consideration in a particular case must generally be determined by the character and situation of the property involved. There exists in fact no rigid rule for the valuation, which is affected by the multitude of circumstances which no rule can foresee or provide for. The assessor must consider all these circumstances and elements of value, and must exercise a prudent discretion in reaching a conclusion.\nActual value, as above defined, determined upon a consideration of so many factors is unavoidably a matter upon which, in respect to many properties, men of experience and capacity will entertain different opinions. The legislature in recognition of this fact provides that actual value as determined by the assessors in the exercise of their own judgment shall be accepted for assessment purposes.\nThe relevant provisions of the Charter of the City of Montreal may be summarized: Sec. 375 above quoted requires that every three years the asssessors shall draw up a new valuation roll for all immovables; sec. 375-c. that \"the chief assessor shall divide the work in such a manner that at least two assessors shall act together in drawing up the valuation roll;\" sec. 373(10) provides that \"the assessors shall be held to perform all the duties imposed upon them by the charter;\" and sec. 374 requires that each assessor shall, before entering upon his duties, declare upon his oath that \"I will faithfully, impartially, honestly and diligently perform the duties of an assessor according to law.\" The statute gives to them a wide latitude in determining their method of procedure and the source from which they may obtain their information, but requires that the amount when finally determined must be the result of their own independent judgment.\nThis requirement is in accord with that which exists in similar assessment legislation where it has been held that the assessors must act independently even of their own council. In re Denne and The Corp. of the Town of Peterborough 28; Lounsbury Co. Ltd. v. Bathurst 29. In Dreifus v. Royds 30, the statute provided in sec. 40(1) \"land shall be assessed at its actual value\" and then in sec. 69 \"the court may, in determining the value at which any land shall be assessed, have reference to the value at which similar land in the vicinity is assessed.\" The board largely determined the actual value of the land in question from that of neighbouring lands assumed to be of the same character. Duff, J. (later Chief Justice) stated at p. 336:\u2014\nIt is very clear to me that the board has proceeded upon the theory that the enactment of sec. 40 ss. 1 is modified by that of ss. 16 of sec. 69 and that the actual value for the purpose of assessment may be something other than the actual value in fact, the determination of which is governed by the practice of the assessor as applied to similar lands in the vicinity. This I think is an erroneous view. The governing enactment is that of section 40, ss. 1, and the rule laid down by ss. 16 of sec. 69, is a subsidiary rule which has been enunciated with the object of facilitating the application of the governing rule. ' The assessment of other lands may be referred to for the purpose of ascertaining the actual value, that is to say as affording some evidence of the actual value but only for that purpose.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the matter referred back to the board to enable them to determine the assessment in accordance with this principle.\nSee also Rogers Realty Co. v. City of Swift Current 31.\nThe fixing of a flat rate over a large acreage throughout which values vary has been held to be invalid: In re Assessment Act and the N. & F.S. Rly. Co. 32; In re Wauchope School Dist. 33. These authorities illustrate the personal responsibility of assessors whose duty it is to determine actual value. It is in recognition of this responsibility so placed upon assessors by the legislatures that Courts have refused to interfere with assessments unless they involve some error in principle or substantial injustice.\nThat the assessors in the City of Montreal should confer with respect to the factors that enter into the making of assessments is to be commended. They may adopt rules and standards which they believe to be of assistance in the more accurate determination of actual value and in the attainment of uniformity in the distribution of the tax burden. In so far, however, as such rules, formulae or plans interfere with, restrict or eliminate the discharge of the assessors' statutory duty, to that extent they cannot be upheld. A Real Estate Valuation Manual prepared for and used by the assessors in the City of Montreal contains the following in its foreword:\u2014\nThe object of this manual is to explain the system and methods to be used in the municipal valuation of real estate and to demonstrate how the problems which originate with the latter may be analyzed and solved by the adoption of certain recognized rules and standards.\nIn addition thereto, and about fifteen months before the roll containing the items here in question was completed, the assessors of that city at a conference adopted a memorandum entitled \"Memorandum on the assessment of large properties, such as office buildings, apartment houses, departmental stores, hotels, etc.\" It states: \"These properties seem to fall into four main categories, which determine to a large extent the relative importance of the different factors to be used in arriving at their valuation.\"\nThis memorandum requires that the two assessors in the ward would first determine whether a building should be classified as one of the \"large properties.\" If so classified, they shall then determine both its replacement and commercial valuations.\nThe assessors having arrived at what they deem replacement and commercial valuations, are then required by the memorandum to decide whether it is wholly or partially owner or tenant occupied. If tenant occupied these valuations shall be apportioned equally, or 50 per cent of each. If wholly owner occupied 100 per cent replacement cost shall be accepted as the assessment valuation. Then when the property is, as here, partially owner and tenant occupied, the assessors must give the replacement valuation at least 50 per cent or such higher percentage as they may decide and the balance to make up the 100 per cent is the percentage of the commercial valuation in the apportionment. The total of these two percentages constitutes the assessment.\nThe assessors arrived at the percentages in this case as follows:\u2014\nIn the case of the Sun Life it was 40 per cent tenant occupied in 1941 and 60 per cent owner occupied. The occupied space. So that would mean that the 50 per cent for commercial would be divided into 20 and 60. There would be another 30 per cent replacement cost added on the 50, to make it 80 and 20. But as the revenues of this building were based on revenues of much cheaper buildings\u2014the revenue of this building received no competition\u2014I consider that half of the commercial value of 20 per cent, making it 10 per cent, would pay for the amenities and benefits received by the owner of the building.\nThe actual computation was:\u2014\nReplacement: 90 per cent of $14,404,578 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 $12,964,120\nRevenue: 10 per cent of$7,915,000 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 791,500\nSay \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. $13,755,500\nLess land \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 730,600\nBuilding \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. $13,024,900\nThe foregoing indicates that the assessors followed the provisions of the memorandum in determining the assessment of the Sun Life building, notwithstanding that the assessor who did the greater part, if not all, of the work in arriving at the amount of the assessment stated \"There is no other building in the city to compare with the Sun Life.\" This statement, founded upon the size and particular architectural features of the building, emphasizes what the authorities insist upon and the Charter of the City of Monreal requires that every building should be assessed upon the judgment of the assessor after considering all the relevant factors. These same authorities indicate that there is an inherent danger in grouping buildings, variously used and located, according to their size. Such is no doubt the paramount reason for the absence in the Charter of the City of Montreal of any rules or other aids or guides to assist in determining actual value.\nThe Sun Life building is an office building and in following the provisions of the memorandum the assessors because its offices were in part occupied by the owner and in part by tenants were required to accept in the apportionment at least 50 per cent of the replacement valuation and, indeed, it is largely this factor that eventually leads to the apportionment of 90 per cent replacement and 10 per cent commercial valuation. Counsel for the appellant stressed occupancy as between owner and tenant is not a determining factor in the determination of actual value of a building. He illustrated his contention by pointing out the mere fact that the tenants move out and owners move in and occupy the premises does not, without more, affect actual value and there is support for this contention in Regina v. Wells 34. In any event, it appears that it has been given an importance in the determination of the actual value of this building that cannot, in the circumstances, be justified.\nThe assessors themselves computed the commercial value of the land and building at $7,915,000 and the replacement value at $14,404,578. Even if it be granted that these valuations include all relevant factors, the Charter of the City of Montreal contemplates that the assessors shall consider the difference between these valuations, give to the factors that make for that difference such importance as the circumstances warrant and in the exercise of their own judgment determine the actual value. This is far different from their proceeding as they have under the direction of the memorandum that fixes the apportionment largely upon the basis of occupancy. In fact as stated above, proceeding upon this basis they arrived at an apportionment of 80 per cent and 20 per cent and then as \"the revenue of this building received no competition\" it was decided that a 90 per cent and a 10 per cent apportionment \"would pay for the amenities and benefits received by the owners of the building.\"\nIt is significant that while in their computation of the assessment only commercial and replacement valuations were considered, upon this appeal respondent submitted that the book and market values as computed by the company and reported to the Superintendent of Insurance should be taken into account. These values were computed and so reported each year. In the year 1941 they were the same and in the sum of $16,258,050.27. On the other hand, the appellant contended that consideration should be given to the fact that after the building was constructed in 1931 it was assessed for the year 1931-32 at $12,400,000, and upon appeal was reduced to $8,000,000, which was increased from year to year as the interior of the building was completed and occupied by tenants until in 1940 the property was assessed at $10,211,200. Both might well be considered but neither is conclusive. These requests of the respective parties but emphasize again the statement included in the quotation from the American and English Ency. of Law, Vol. 27, p. 690, where it is stated:\u2014\nThere exists in fact no rigid rule for the valuation, which is affected by the multitude of circumstances which no rule can foresee or provide for.\nNotwithstanding the desirability, if, indeed, not the necessity of the assessors conferring for the purpose, as already mentioned, in a city the size of Montreal, it does seem that having regard to the admittedly unique, distinct and different character of this building that, in the main, it has been assessed as any \"large property\" within the terms of the memorandum. In these circumstances, notwithstanding the judgment exercised by the assessors in fixing the percentages, there has not been that assessment of this building contemplated by the statute.\nThe second contention raises issues as to what ought to be made by way of allowances and deductions. The assessors allowed a deduction for the fact that the building was built in three completed buildings, the first in 1918, the second in 1925 and the third in 1930. A further deduction for structural depreciation and an allowance to adjust the cost figure to that of 1941. Mr. Justice Mackinnon allowed a further deduction of 14 per cent for extra unnecessary costs of construction. The appellant, however, contends that there should be a further allowance for functional depreciation, that \"the Sun Life Building suffers from a very serious functional disability resulting from the inherent design of the building.\" This, it is pointed out, involves a large amount of waste space which cannot be utilized, as well as additional space which is undesirable because it is either inadequately lighted or altogether dark. The contention is \"this waste space and this excessive undesirable space detract from the value of the building whether to a prospective purchaser or to the Sun Life Company itself.\"\nIt is a very large building occupying an entire city block, rising 25 storeys above the ground and appropriately described as of a \"massive cubical design \u2026 with walls unbroken by courts or light wells,\" that the heavy columns as well as other architectural features and embellishments, together with the fact that throughout the finest materials and equipment were used made the construction cost excessive in relation to its exchange value.\nMr. Justice Mackinnon granted depreciation for extra unnecessary or excessive costs upon the evidence that the granite walls, bronze sashes, vita plate glass, marble floors and walls, ornamental structure and interior decorations, though adding much to the attractiveness of the building, did not increase its revenue or earning possibilities in a commensurate amount. Mr. Justice Mackinnon stated that:\u2014\nIn allowing this additional 14 per cent for depreciation the court has not taken into consideration the excess cost of the hospital, auditorium, kitchen and cafeteria services and private elevators as they all form part of the special services enjoyed by the Sun Life although adding little to the actual value of the building * * * *\nThe unreported case of State of Minnesota v. Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, a copy of which was included in the record, was cited in support of a functional allowance. The State of Minnesota required the assessor to determine the \"true and full value.\" It was there contended that because the building was constructed for and solely occupied by the bank that it had \"considerable waste space even in its present use,\" and as its maintenance was excessive, it was unsuitable as a business property. The assessor determined the cost of reproduction in the year in question and then allowed 25 per cent for physical depreciation and a further 25 per cent to cover \"the effect of the distinctive architecture on its market value, both artistically and as a utilitarian structure.\" The Court affirmed the assessment at this valuation. The phrase \"both artistically and as a utilitarian structure\" would seem to include both that which Mr. Jusice Mackinnon allowed \"for extra unnecessary costs\" as well as an allowance for what the appellant terms \"functional depreciation.\"\nMessrs. Perreault and Archambault, whose valuations were respectively $8,625,200 and $9,001,983 (the lowest replacement valuations deposed to), included an allowance for \"functional depreciation.\" The Board of Revision disallowed this item but stated \"that in making allowances for 'functional' depreciation and obsolescence, on top of the physical depreciation, they (Perreault and Archam- bault) have overstepped the field of the replacement to encroach on the one of the economic value. The deficiencies, if they exist, are reflected in the rental value on which is based the commercial value; so that Messrs. Perreault and Archambault are making double use of the same allowances.\"\nOn principle, it would appear that such non-productive features of a building, in so far as they do not add to its actual value (as already defined) ought not to be included among items in the determination of that value. In so far as such items do not enter into or form a part of the actual value and yet are included in the computation thereof the taxpayer is called upon to pay an annual tax thereon which ought not, within the accepted definition of \"actual value\", to be included. When, therefore, these factors are established the assessors ought to make such fair and reasonable allowances as the particular circumstances may justify.\nThe business and water assessments have been affirmed in each of the lower Courts and while in many cases the contention of the appellant would be applicable, there is in the particular circumstances of this case justification for a difference such as has been here computed.\nThe errors in principle involved in the foregoing determination of actual value would, in the ordinary course, justify a reference back to the assessors. However, at the hearing the parties intimated that they would prefer, should we find such errors, a direction fixing actual value as determined by Mr. Justice Mackinnon. In compliance with that suggestion, the appeal will therefore be allowed and the judgment varied to fix the actual value of the Sun Life Building at $10,207,877.40.\nThe appellant should have its costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Montgomery, McMichael, Common, Howard, Forsyth & Ker.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Saint-Pierre, Choquette, Berthiaume, Emard, Martineau, McDonald & S\u00e9guin.\n1 Q.R.

The respondents' assessors in assessing timber lands in the Parish, estimated the average price to be $5 an acre and assessed all such lands, including those of the appellants, accordingly. The appellants appealed to the County Court Judge under s. 78 of the Act alleging that its lands had been overrated absolutely or as compared with other properties in the Parish. He dismissed the appeal. An appeal was then made by way of certiorari to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, on the grounds that the assessors in making the assessment proceeded upon a wrong principle. That appeal was also dismissed.\nHeld: The question before this Court is whether on the entire proceedings the assessment appears to have been made on a wrong principle. The Judge in appeal considered the assessment de novo in all its aspects. He properly construed the Statute to provide for valuation on a market basis, as between a willing seller and a willing purchaser, each exercising a reasonable judgment, having regard to all elements and potentialities of value as well as of all risks, and reducing them all to present worth: Montreal Island Power Co. v. The Town of Laval des Rapides [1935] S.C.R. 304. The conclusion to which he came, therefore, is amply supported by evidence adduced before him.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick 1, dismissing, Harrison J. dissenting, an application by way of certiorari from the decision of His Honour C.J. Jones, Judge of the Carleton County Court.\nJ. J. F. Winslow, K.C., and C. F. Inches, K.C., for the appellant.\nA. B. Gilbert, K.C., and G. W. Montgomery, for the respondents. The judgment of the Court was delivered by:\u2014\nRand J.:\u2014These proceedings originated in an order of certiorari bringing an assessment of lands by the respondents before the Supreme Court of New Brunswick. Under section 78 of the Bate and Taxes Act the appellant had appealed against the assessment to the Judge of the County Court who affirmed the assessment. The petition on that appeal alleged that the lands had been \"over-valued absolutely and as compared with the valuation of other property real and personal\" in the parish. Section 78 gives a right of appeal to a non-resident if he \"considers himself over-rated or otherwise unjustly assessed\". On the hearing, questions of the proper principle for determining value, the impropriety of the adoption of a flat rate for timber lands, and the valuation of large tracts of such lands as compared with farm lands and personal property, were raised and evidence presented in relation to them.\nUnder section 126 of the Act, the Supreme Court may remit the roll to the assessors if they have proceeded upon a wrong principle in whole or part and a proper assessment could have been made by them; and the question considered was whether such an error had been made. On the return of the order nisi, it was held, Harrison, J. dissenting, that no such error appeared and the rule was discharged.\nThe right to certiorari is either assumed to exist by or is a necessary implication from sections 124, 125 and 126 of the statute; by the order, the entire record, including the proceedings before the Judge in appeal has been brought up; and although section 126 speaks of \"the assessors\" proceeding upon a wrong principle, the statute, allowing an appeal, and certiorari being taken to lie following an appeal, The King, ex parte Bank of Nova Scotia v. Assessors of Rates and Taxes of Woodstock, N.B. 2, the question before us, as both counsel assumed, is whether on the entire proceedings, the assessment appears to have been made on a wrong principle.\nOn that footing, two objections were taken; the first was that the \"real and true value\" of the lands which section 5, as amended by chap. 36, 1945, provides as the measures or basis of valuation, should have been found by reference to the capitalization of the net annual productive return ascertained by the use of estimated factors of sale price and a fair rate of interest return; and the second, that for timber lands or as they are called \"wild lands\", an average rate of $5 an acre had been used by the assessors for all such lands in the parish and that no individual valuation of the substantial holdings of the appellant had been made.\nThe former was the main contention made before us by Mr. Winslow. His proposition was this: the true value of lands of this character depends upon what they will yield in salable products; what is, then, to be ascertained is the quantity of annual growth of the trees, its commercial value, the expenses of management and an estimate of all risks. From this the capitalized value is calculated as of a permanent investment.\nIn support of that formula, evidence was led of the annual increment of growth by data contained in government reports covering woodlands throughout the Dominion, and the average of 30' superficial board measure an acre was taken as the first factor. The expenses as shown by the operations of the appellant were reduced to the same basis. The price was put at $2.50 a thousand feet, and the interest rate was at large. In strict mathematics, if all of the factors, including risks, periodic fluctuations and convertible or competing forms of investment for the realizable capital, were fully and accurately weighed and given effect, the resulting capital would approximate the market value.\nBut the language of the statute cannot be taken to intend such a process. These considerations are indeed' relevant to real value but, as all the judges below have held, the task placed upon the assessors, as men of ordinary understanding and knowledge, is of a much simpler and practical, though possibly much rougher, nature. They are to regard these elusive variables and uncertainties not directly but what they sum up to in the minds of people who actually or theoretically buy and sell woodlands. Those elements, consciously or unconsciously, operate on the business mind and determine the business judgment; but to employ them as factors in the manner submitted, and on the evidence presented, would substitute an imperfect and artificial estimate for that arising from the experience of the market place. Particularly would that be objectionable when it is remembered that relative valuation is here more important in fact than the so-called absolute.\nThe figure of $5 an acre was the average price estimated by the assessors from their local knowledge of sales of small holdings, such as 100-acre lots. It was said that these sales ran from $3 to $8 an acre, and that $5 was, therefore, a fair valuation. In this the assessors were undoubtedly wrong. Each taxpayer is entitled to have the value of his property separately ascertained. The difference in the prices used might possibly have arisen from differences in time and market conditions rather than in real marketable worth, in which case the propriety of the amount would depend upon equivalence in value, in the absence of which throughout the parish an average figure could not be used. But such a figure is obviously to be distinguished from an average valuation of a large tract of land belonging to one taxpayer and exhibiting wide variations in the value of its several parts.\nBut the Judge in appeal considered the assessment de novo in all its aspects. Rejecting the principle in the inadequate form urged by the company, he properly construed the Statute to provide for valuation on a market basis, as between a willing seller and, a willing purchaser, each exercising a reasonable judgment, having regard to all elements and potentialities of value as well as of all risks, and reducing them all to a present worth: Montreal Island Power Co. v. The Town of Laval des Rapides 3. I say reasonable judgment because an element of time is involved in the words \"real and true\"; they are, I think, to be contrasted with what the ordinary opinion would consider fictitious, as a nominal value out of relation to reality, to which it would soon and inevitably return.\nThe appeal was against the value \"absolutely\" and this the Judge set himself to ascertain. That in doing so, he is to be taken as having disregarded the evidence of a number of sales of large tracts of the same general character as those in question and confined himself to the evidence of stumpage rates, is an inference which is not justified. He found that $5 was not in excess of the fair value of the land. The purchases made in 1942 and 1943 show one at $3.15 an acre for a tract of 627,800 acres, one at $3.25 for 20,250 acres, two at $3.50 for 85,600 and 40,000 acres respectively and one at $4 for 176,000 acres. He was satisfied that the companies could have disposed of the stumpage for $12.15 an acre, leaving a residue of lands and fire wood. It was conceded that in 1946 there had been a firm increase in the value of the lands and a sale of 68,715 acres, as stated in the prospectus of the St. John Sulphite Company Limited which is to be treated in the same position as the appellant, \"for the price of $515,500 payable by the issue of 51,550 preferred shares at $10 each\" represents a rate for each acre of $7.50. The area of the lands of the appellant which are in question is 84,574 acres. The conclusion to which he came, therefore, is amply supported by evidence adduced before him.\nThe appellant had m 1946 and evidently in 1947 been engaged in a detailed survey of the timber on its lands, extending beyond the parish and county in question. On being asked for a report of it, counsel charily stated that the survey had not been completed, but he did not say that it had not already produced matter material to the assessment.\nOn the second branch of the claim, the Judge in appeal found that the assessors had improperly fixed arbitrary values for automobiles, trucks and tractors, but on the evidence before him he held that relatively to the real and true values of the property whose assessment was challenged, discrimination against the appellant had not been established. As that was a question of fact in which no principle of law was involved, it is not open on these proceedings.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J.

The deed was drawn by a solicitor acting on H\u2019s instructions and he retained the deed. During his lifetime H collected the revenues paying over one half of the net proceeds to M. H died in 1928 and his widow appointed agents, who were adopted by M. These collected the rents, paying one-half of the net rents to M. The widow died in 1937 having by her will devised a life interest in one half of the property to her sister with remainder over to R. The agents continued to collect the rents, paying one half to M and the remainder to the widow\u2019s devisees. In 1946 M decided to sell his share in the property and on searching the title found that under the deed to H and himself he held as a joint tenant and not as a tenant in common. He sued for a declaration of title as sole owner, and for an accounting from the executrices of H\u2019s widow, R, by order of the trial court, being added as a party defendant. R counter-claimed for a declaration that he was entitled to an undivided one-half interest in the property.\nHeld: (Affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal) that the appeal and the counter\u2011appeal be dismissed.\nPer: The Chief Justice, Kerwin and Estey JJ., the decision of the trial judge[1] and that of the Court of Appeal[2] that M was the sole owner of the lands in question should be affirmed\u2014his title was not barred by The Limitations Act, and he had not been guilty of laches. Per: Rand J., where there is joint possession by an owner and third persons under the erroneous belief that they hold as tenants in common, there is unity of possession de facto but not de jure, and such an actual unity does not permit of possession against the owner within Baldwin v. Kingstone, 18 A.R., 63.\nHeld, also by the Chief Justice, Kerwin and Estey JJ., that the claim against the executrices of the widow\u2019s estate was barred by The Limitations Act, s. 48 (g).\nPer: Rand J., that the claim against the executrices must fail as on the evidence M and the widow\u2019s heirs dealt directly with the rents through their joint agent and the executrices had withdrawn entirely from any connection with them.\nLocke J., agreed with the reasons for judgment delivered by Laidlaw JA., with whom Aylesworth JA., concurred.\nAPPEAL by the defendant Charles B. Randall from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[3] whereby it was declared that the plaintiff McLaughlin was the sole owner of certain lands and premises known as 154 Cowan Ave., Toronto, and cross-appeal by McLaughlin from the dismissal by the Court of Appeal of his claim against the executrices of the Estate of Irene Hill for the rents and profits of the property.\nE.P. Brown, K.C., and Charles Kappele for the appellant Randall.\nR.R. McMurty, K.C., and D.A. Keith for the respondent and cross-appellant McLaughlin.\nJohn J. Robinette, K.C., for Executrices of the Estate of Irene Hill, deceased, respondents on the cross-appeal.\nThe judgment of The Chief Justice, Kerwin and Estey, JJ., was delivered by:\u2014\nKERWIN J.:\u2014On December 1, 1919, lands and premises in the City of Toronto were purchased jointly by Laurent T. McLaughlin (also known as Lorne T. McLaughlin) and Thomas Hill and the conveyance was made to the two of them as joint tenants and not as tenants in common. At that time Hill was a widower without children and McLaughlin was not married. Hill was about twenty years older than McLaughlin and had known the younger man intimately ever since his very early youth. When the latter returned from the first Great War as lieutenant-colonel and with a fine war record, the older man was very proud, and since he had no children looked upon McLaughlin as one of his own. Hill had been successful in investing in real estate and it was his suggestion that the two should purchase the property and, as he was the one who had the experience, everything was left to him and his were the instructions that went to the solicitor who prepared the conveyance. McLaughlin knew nothing of joint tenancy or tenancy in common but testified at the trial of this action that Hill told him that on his (Hill\u2019s) death, McLaughlin alone would own the property.\nEach provided a like amount for the purchase and received one-half of the rents after an allowance of five percentum to Hill as a management fee, which McLaughlin insisted should be retained by the older man. Subsequently Hill married again. Upon his death, McLaughlin not hearing anything about a will, assumed that the matter must have been overlooked by Hill. He received one-half of the net rents collected by agents appointed by Hill\u2019s widow, Irene, but which agents, on the evidence, must be taken to have also been adopted by McLaughlin as his own. It was only early in 1946, when he decided to sell what he thought was his one\u2011half interest, that he ascertained that the conveyance had been made to Hill and himself as joint tenants. Even upon the death of Hill and Hill\u2019s widow, this fact had not been discovered by the personal representatives of either as the succession duty forms in connection with each estate stated that Hill, and then his wife, owned a one-half interest.\nThis action was commenced on May 2, 1946, by McLaughlin against the executrices of Mrs. Irene Hill, asking for the one-half of the rents received by Mrs. Hill from December 13, 1928, the date of the death of Thomas Hill, until her death, viz., April 24, 1937, and thereafter by the defendants. When the case was first ready for trial, at the suggestion of the presiding judge, Charles B. Randall was added as a party and the trial postponed but the statement of claim was not amended. By her will Mrs. Hill had devised the lands and premises in question to her sister, Elizabeth Randall, for life, and thereafter to her nephew Charles B. Randall, who was the added defendant.\nAccording to a statement of the collection agents filed at the trial, Mrs. Hill received one-half of the net rents to the time of her death; thereafter the \u201cestate of Mrs. I. Hill\u201d received as its one-half share of the rents four cheques from May 21 to August 17, 1937; Elizabeth Randall received twenty-two cheques for her share from September 3, 1937, to August 17, 1943; and thereafter Charles B. Randall received six cheques until this question arose. During all this period, as during Hill\u2019s lifetime, McLaughlin received one-half of the net rents. The executrices severed in their defence but all set up The Limitations Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 118. Randall, upon being added a party, adopted the defences of his co-defendants and by way of counter-claim sought a declaration that he was entitled to an undivided one-half interest in the property.\nThe trial judge[4] and the Court of Appeal[5] decided that the plaintiff was the sole owner, that his title was not barred by The Limitations Act, and that he had not been guilty of laches. With these conclusions I agree. The conveyance of December 1, 1919, is clear and unambiguous. The solicitor who drew it had died before the trial and there is nothing in the evidence to substantiate the claim of the defendant Randall that it does not carry out the intention of Hill who gave the instructions to the solicitor. As to The Limitations Act, none of the defendants, or their predecessors, was ever in exclusive possession of the lands and premises or any particular part of them since the plaintiff regularly received one-half of the net rents. As to laches, the plaintiff never knew of his rights until shortly before the writ was issued.\nThe trial judge also gave judgment for the plaintiff against all the defendants for \u201c$936.96, being a one-half portion of the amount of the rents and profits of the entire property from May 2, 1940, together with the sum of $100.30, simple interest thereon at 3%, a total in all of $1,037.26\u201d. So far as the defendant Randall is concerned, this is clearly an error as he received only $491.11, the total of the six cheques sent him by the agents. In any event, as has been pointed out previously, the statement of claim was not amended after the addition of Randall as a party defendant and at the trial it was stated that no claim was advanced against him. Under these circumstances, the plaintiff is not entitled to secure anything from him. Within a period of six years prior to the issue of the writ, the only other person who was paid one-half of the net rents was Elizabeth Randall now deceased, and no one representing her is a party. As to all these payments, none went directly through the hands of the executrices of Irene Hill and the agents at this time were not their agents but at the highest the agents for the individuals mentioned and the plaintiff. To any claim that might otherwise have exised against the executrices, section 48 (1) (g) of The Limitations Act is a complete defence as the action was not commenced within six years after the cause of action arose.\nIn the result, the appeal of the defendant Randall and the cross-appeal of the plaintiff fail. At the trial, the executrix Blanche Summers severed in her defence from that of her co\u2011executrices and she was separately represented in the Court of Appeal. That Court made no order as to the costs of the action or counter-claim or of the appeals to it. Before this Court, all the executrices were represented by the same counsel. The appellant Randall should pay the costs of the appeal to the plaintiff respondent but the latter should pay the costs of his cross\u2011appeal to the parties hereto.\nRAND J.:\u2014The deed conveying the property to the respondent and the deceased, Hill, as joint tenants is shown to have been prepared under the instructions of the latter who and whose successors in title retained it until after the death of the deceased and his widow. The respondent knew nothing of its provisions, and until within a short time of commencing these proceedings assumed that with Hill he was in fact, though not in name, a tenant in common, and that the interest of the deceased had been transmitted to the widow and to the appellant, Randall. From this the unassailable fact that emerges is that neither Hill nor his successors had any standing to challenge the joint tenancy so created; and even if the respondent could have done so, he is free to waive such an equity.\nThe further question is whether or not the appellant acquired the title of a tenant in common by the fact that he and his predecessor had been in receipt of one-half of the rents for over ten years. This question was dealt with in Baldwin v. Kingstone[6], in which a strong court, after argument by outstanding counsel of that day, held that the statute did not apply where part of the rents during the period for which the benefit of the statute was claimed, had been paid to the owner: that where there is joint possession by the owner and third persons, it is, for the purposes of the statute to be attributed to him. The facts were identical with those here except the circumstance that instead of the owner having the entire estate he was himself a tenant in common; but it was a fractional share of his interest that was in question. The rents had been collected by his co-tenant and had been paid one-sixth to him and one-sixth each to a brother and sister. The latter were in precisely the same relation to him as the appellant here was toward the respondent, McLaughlin; and there as here the parties acted under an erroneous belief that the lands were held by them as tenants in common. In the conception of that tenancy, there is unity of possession and although there was no unity de jure, there was in both cases a de facto possession of that nature. That actual unity does not permit a possession against the owner within it. The appellant\u2019s only answer to this case is that it was one of tenancy in common, but, as I have observed, that was not so in relation to the interests claimed to have been acquired adversely. The appeal must, therefore, be dismissed.\nThe cross-appeal claiming one-half of the rents against the executrices of the will of the widow must also fail on the simple ground that the evidence makes it clear that the appellant and the respondent dealt directly with the rents through their joint agent, and that the executrices had withdrawn entirely from any connection with them. The receiver was not their agent at any time within six years of the bringing of the action, and the only ground on which, in the circumstances, they could be held liable is absent. As against Randall, the respondent did not plead a claim for rents received, in fact at the opening of the trial counsel expressly disclaimed any such relief, and he cannot on appeal set it up.\nThe respondent, McLaughlin, will be entitled to his costs of the appeal and the respondent executrices and the appellant, to their costs against the respondent, McLaughlin, on the cross-appeal.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons for judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Laidlaw and with his conclusions and would dismiss both the appeal and the cross-appeal. As to costs, I agree with the order proposed by my brother Kerwin.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant and respondent on cross-appeal, Randall: Kappele & Kappele.\nSolicitors for the respondent, and appellant on cross-appeal, McLaughlin: Chitty, McMurtry, Ganong & Keith.\nSolicitors for respondents on cross-appeal, the Executrices of the Estate of Irene Hill, deceased: John J.

S362). Appellant was authorized by. the Custodian of Enemy Property to bring action against respondent for infringement of copyright. The authors of the works in question were residents of France and at the time of the infringement, 1942 and 1943, the copyrights in such works had become vested in the Custodian pursuant to the Consolidated Regulations Respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1939. The Exchequer Court dismissed the action on the main ground that the Custodian could not delegate his powers.\nHeld: That s. 4 of the Copyright Act was continued in force during the war by virtue of s. 8 of the Patents, Designs, Copyright and Trade Marks (Emergency) Order, 1939, (P.C. 3362), made under the War Measures Act, but any copyright recognized by the section was for that period vested in the Custodian of Enemy Property.\nHeld: That s. 6 (2) of P.C. 3362 in clear terms permitted the Custodian to delegate his power to such person as he thought fit.\nHeld: That the authors, being classed as enemies and having no more rights in these copyrights, could not give to the respondent permission to publish these works\u2014assuming that the evidence of this permission was legal.\nPer Kerwin, Taschereau, Estey and Locke JJ.: Assuming that the Convention of Berne was suspended during the war, these copyrights were, nevertheless protected, because literary property of foreign authors, being property within the meaning of the Regulations Respecting Trading with the Enemy, is protected in Canada not by virtue of the Convention of Berne but by s. 4 of the Copyright Act. The Convention serves only to identify the countries the citizens of which are entitled to that protection.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Angers J. 1, dismissing an action for infringement of copyright.\nRedmond Quain, K.C., for the appellant.\nJacques Perrault for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014En janvier, f\u00e9vrier, mars, avril 1942 et mars 1943, l'intim\u00e9 a reproduit, sans autorisation des auteurs, dans sa revue \"Aujourd'hui\", certaines compositions \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans l'expos\u00e9 de la r\u00e9clamation de l'appelant et qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de reproduire ici.\nChacun des auteurs ainsi reproduits est un citoyen ou sujet d'un pays \u00e9tranger ayant adh\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la Convention de Berne et au Protocole additionnel de cette m\u00eame Convention publi\u00e9s dans la Seconde Annexe de la Loi de 1921 concernant le droit d'auteur (Chap. 24 S.C. XI, XII\u2014 George V) sanctionn\u00e9e le 4 juin 1921 et reproduite au chapitre 32 des Statuts Revis\u00e9s du Canada, 1927. Par suite de cette qualit\u00e9, chacun des auteurs en question b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait de l'article 4 (1) de cette Loi concernant le droit d'auteur pendant toute la dur\u00e9e de sa vie et une p\u00e9riode de cinquante ans apr\u00e8s sa mort (art. 5) et il \u00e9tait \"le premier titulaire du droit d'auteur sur son \u0153uvre\" (art. 11 (1)), ce qui lui donnait le droit \"d'interdire la publication de cet ouvrage ailleurs que dans le journal, dans la revue ou dans le p\u00e9riodique\" o\u00f9 il parut originalement.\nIl s'ensuit que la publication sans autorisation des compositions \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es dans l'expos\u00e9 de r\u00e9clamation constituait une atteinte aux droits de leurs auteurs et une \"violation du droit d'auteur\" conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 16 de la Loi. Mais cette violation se produisait, comme les dates l'indiquent, au cours de la guerre de 1939 et au moment o\u00f9 la France, dont les auteurs \u00e9taient les citoyens ou les sujets, \u00e9tait occup\u00e9e par l'ennemi et, en cons\u00e9quence, \u00e9tait devenue un pays consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ennemi aux yeux de la loi canadienne.\nPar suite de la guerre, le gouvernement du Canada, ainsi qu'il y avait \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 par la Loi des mesures de Guerre, adopta des r\u00e8glements relatifs au commerce avec l'ennemi et des arr\u00eat\u00e9s en conseil relatifs au droit d'auteur portant les num\u00e9ros 3362, 3959, 5353 et 8526.\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 judiciairement que ces r\u00e8glements et arr\u00eat\u00e9s en conseil adopt\u00e9s en vertu de la Loi des mesures de guerre, ont la m\u00eame force et le m\u00eame effet que s'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9s comme lois du Parlement du Canada.\nOr, d'apr\u00e8s l'article 8 (1) de l'arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil relatif au droit d'auteur n\u00b0 3362, l'article 4 de la Loi concernant le droit d'auteur (Chap. 32, S.R.C. 1927) a continu\u00e9 d'\u00eatre en vigueur nonobstant l'\u00e9tat de guerre ainsi que les R\u00e8glements relatifs aux relations avec l'ennemi, mais avec la restriction suivante pourvue au paragraphe (2) de cet article 8: \"Que les droits d'auteurs qui \u00e9taient citoyens ou sujets d'un pays \u00e9tranger, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ennemi en vertu de la loi, passaient entre les mains du S\u00e9questre du Canada et sous son contr\u00f4le de telle fa\u00e7on que, pendant la dur\u00e9e de la guerre, ces droits ne pouvaient \u00eatre exerc\u00e9s que par le S\u00e9questre ainsi nomm\u00e9. Tant que la guerre subsis- tait, les droits des auteurs \u00e9taient suspendus et \u00e9taient, pour toutes fins, transmis au S\u00e9questre du Canada\" (Article 21 de l'arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil n\u00b0 2512, tel qu'amend\u00e9 par les arr\u00eat\u00e9s en conseil n08 3959 et 5353).\nToujours en vertu des m\u00eames arr\u00eat\u00e9s en conseil, le S\u00e9questre \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 poursuivre devant la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier du Canada pour le recouvrement de tout droit payable en vertu des r\u00e8glements adopt\u00e9s \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard (art. 36 (1)); et aucune personne ne pouvait prendre aucune proc\u00e9dure relative \u00e0 ces droits sans le consentement du S\u00e9questre (art. 47 (3)). Mais, d'autre part, le S\u00e9questre \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9l\u00e9guer et transmettre ses pouvoirs \u00e0 toute personne qu'il jugerait \u00e0 propos (art. 6 (2)).\nL'article 20 de la Loi concernant le droit d'auteur conf\u00e9rait au propri\u00e9taire de ce droit, dans le cas d'infraction par une autre personne, le pouvoir de recourir \u00e0 tous moyens de r\u00e9paration, par voie d'ordonnance de cessation ou d'interdiction, de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, de d\u00e9comptes ou autrement. Comme cons\u00e9quence de la guerre, ces droits se sont trouv\u00e9s transf\u00e9r\u00e9s au S\u00e9questre du Canada qui, d\u00e8s lors, pouvait les exercer, soit par lui-m\u00eame, soit par l'interm\u00e9diaire de toute personne \u00e0 qui il jugeait \u00e0 propos de les d\u00e9l\u00e9guer.\nLe 17 avril 1943, le S\u00e9questre d\u00e9l\u00e9gua tels pouvoirs \u00e0 l'appelant, M. Louvigny de Montigny, pour poursuivre devant les tribunaux, \u00e0 l'encontre de l'intim\u00e9, la violation des droits d'auteurs commise par ce dernier en publiant les compositions mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 l'expos\u00e9 de la r\u00e9clamation de l'appelant.\nMuni de cette autorisation, l'appelant demanda \u00e0 la Cour d'\u00c9chiquier du Canada 2 une d\u00e9claration \u00e0 l'effet que les auteurs mentionn\u00e9s dans l'expos\u00e9 de r\u00e9clamation \u00e9taient les premiers titulaires des droits d'auteurs sur les compositions qui portaient leurs signatures; que ces ouvrages \u00e9taient prot\u00e9g\u00e9s au Canada jusqu'\u00e0 l'expiration d'une p\u00e9riode de cinquante ans apr\u00e8s la mort de leurs auteurs; qu'en reproduisant ces compositions litt\u00e9raires sans autorisation pr\u00e9alable et formelle, l'intim\u00e9 avait viol\u00e9 le droit de ces auteurs et avait \u00e9galement frustr\u00e9 le S\u00e9questre du Canada, en temps que cessionnaire et d\u00e9tenteur par l'effet des r\u00e8glements de guerre, des droits des auteurs dont l'intim\u00e9 avait reproduit les compositions. Il demanda donc l'\u00e9mission d'une injonction interdisant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 toute autre reproduction dans sa revue \"Aujourd'hui\" des compositions d'auteurs prot\u00e9g\u00e9s au Canada et il r\u00e9clama des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats au total de $359.55, repr\u00e9sentant dix cents par ligne des reproductions ill\u00e9galement publi\u00e9es par l'intim\u00e9; avec, en plus, une ordonnance obligeant l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 remettre \u00e0 l'appelant ces exemplaires contrefaits des ouvrages qui font l'objet de la r\u00e9clamation, ou de lui en payer la valeur \u00e9quivalente; concluant, en plus, \u00e0 l'octroi de telles autres indemnit\u00e9s ou compensations que comportait la nature de l'esp\u00e8ce et que la Cour estimerait justes.\nCette action fut rejet\u00e9e par la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier 3 pour plusieurs raisons, dont la principale \u00e9tait le principe en vertu duquel nul ne peut plaider au nom d'autrui, et que ni la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Gens de Lettres de France, ni le S\u00e9questre, et \u00e0 plus forte raison, l'appelant, n'avait qualit\u00e9 pour intenter une action pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des auteurs des articles en question.\nSur ce point, la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier invoque l'article 81 du Code de proc\u00e9dure de Qu\u00e9bec, ainsi que plusieurs jugements rendus en conformit\u00e9 de cette disposition; de m\u00eame que le droit anglais et la doctrine qui a cours en France.\nEn plus, le jugement d\u00e9cide que l'article 8 de l'arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil sur les brevets, les dessins de fabrique et le droit d'auteur (n\u00b0 3362) n'a aucune port\u00e9e sur le litige. Il interpr\u00e8te cet article comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 \"d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement pour permettre au registraire des droits d'auteurs d'\u00e9mettre des licences autorisant la reproduction d'\u0153uvres compos\u00e9es par un ennemi durant la guerre; hors ce cas le droit commun subsiste int\u00e9gralement\".\nEnfin, comme motif additionnel, la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 certaines parties de la preuve o\u00f9 il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, dans le cas des articles de deux p\u00e8res j\u00e9suites, les membres de la Compagnie de J\u00e9sus pouvaient reproduire, sans autorisation sp\u00e9ciale et sans droit d'auteur, les articles de leurs confr\u00e8res; et, dans le cas de la publication de l'article de M. Yves-R. Simon, intitul\u00e9 \"Maritain intime,\" cette publication a \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e par l'auteur lui-m\u00eame; enfin, relativement \u00e0 la reproduction d'un article d'Henri Gh\u00e9on, \"L'art du th\u00e9\u00e2tre,\" M. Jean-Marie Parent, des \u00c9ditions du Cap, se pr\u00e9tendant possesseur des droits d'auteur d'Henri Gh\u00e9on, aurait verbalement autoris\u00e9, en f\u00e9vrier 1942, la reproduction de cet article dans la revue \"Aujourd'hui\".\nLe jugement dont est appel se termine en disant que l'honorable juge qui a pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 le proc\u00e8s ne croyait pas que l'intim\u00e9, en l'occurrence, ait \"fait preuve de mauvaise foi\". Je puis dire tout de suite, \u00e0 ce sujet, que nul ne croit que l'intim\u00e9 ait agi de mauvaise foi, mais que l\u00e0 n'est pas la question. La Loi concernant le droit d'auteur consid\u00e8re comme une violation la publication d'articles prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par cette loi, sans l'autorisation de l'auteur ou de celui qui est d\u00e9tenteur du droit d'auteur. Et cette loi doit recevoir son application m\u00eame quand la publication a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite de bonne foi. Dans ce cas, il faudra dire: \"Dura lex sed lex\".\nEn plus, quand le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance fait \u00e9tat des autorisations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales ou sp\u00e9ciales qui auraient pu \u00eatre donn\u00e9es \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 par les auteurs des articles, il ne tient pas compte du fait que les articles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9s en temps de guerre; que, d\u00e8s lors, les droits des auteurs en question \u00e9taient suspendus par suite de la guerre; que ces droits \u00e9taient transf\u00e9r\u00e9s par la loi au S\u00e9questre du Canada; et que toute autorisation donn\u00e9e par les auteurs \u00e9tait donc n\u00e9cessairement inefficace, puisque ces auteurs ne pouvaient \u00e9videmment autoriser et transmettre des droits qu'ils n'avaient pas \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0\u2014des droits qui \u00e9taient suspendus pendant la guerre\u2014et dont seul le S\u00e9questre du Canada \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenteur. Ces autorisations sont de nature \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer la bonne foi de l'intim\u00e9, mais elles ne peuvent modifier la situation dans laquelle il s'est plac\u00e9. Si, toutefois, une autorisation pouvait lui \u00eatre valablement donn\u00e9e, il fallait qu'elle vienne du S\u00e9questre du Canada.\nSur ce point, j'ajouterais que j'ai plus qu'un doute que la preuve des autorisations dont il s'agit ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite lors de l'enqu\u00eate \u00e0 l'encontre des objections du procureur de l'appelant; et, si cela \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire, j'arriverais \u00e0 la conclusion que cette preuve, telle qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale. Mais, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire d'entrer dans cette discussion, vu qu'il est bien \u00e9vident, qu'en temps de guerre, pareilles autorisations \u00e9taient inefficaces.\nAyant \u00e9cart\u00e9 ces motifs suppl\u00e9mentaires du jugement, il ne reste plus qu'\u00e0 consid\u00e9rer les deux motifs principaux, qui sont: que, d'apr\u00e8s le jugement dont est appel, l'article 8 de l'arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil n\u00b0 3362 n'a aucune port\u00e9e sur le pr\u00e9sent litige; et que, par ailleurs, l'appelant n'avait pas la qualit\u00e9 voulue pour intenter l'action, parce que le S\u00e9questre ne pouvait lui c\u00e9der ses droits et que l'appelant ne pouvait poursuivre en son nom personnel.\nJ'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, qu'\u00e0 mon avis, l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 8 de l'arr\u00eat\u00e9 en conseil n\u00b0 3362 est \u00e0 l'effet que l'article 4 de la Loi concernant le droit d'auteur continue d'\u00eatre en vigueur, nonobstant l'\u00e9tat de guerre, mais avec la restriction que les droits d'auteurs reconnus par cet article 4 sont, pour le temps de la guerre, transf\u00e9r\u00e9s au S\u00e9questre du Canada, qui, seul, en est d\u00e9tenteur pendant la dur\u00e9e de la guerre et qui, seul, peut les exercer.\nIl s'en suit, qu'en l'esp\u00e8ce, nous n'avons pas \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer les droits respectifs des auteurs des articles et ceux de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Gens de Lettres de France. Pendant la guerre ces droits \u00e9taient suspendus, que l'on arrive \u00e0 la conclusion qu'ils appartenaient aux auteurs eux-m\u00eames ou \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Gens de Lettres.\nTous les droits en question, pendant la guerre, appartenaient au S\u00e9questre du Canada. Il pouvait les exercer lui-m\u00eame, ou, comme nous l'avons vu, en vertu de l'article 6 (2) des R\u00e8glements sur le commerce avec l'ennemi, r\u00e9sultant des arr\u00eat\u00e9s en conseil nos 3959 et 5353, le S\u00e9questre pouvait les d\u00e9l\u00e9guer \u00e0 la personne qu'il jugeait comp\u00e9tente.\nLe document par lequel le S\u00e9questre a d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 ses pouvoirs \u00e0 l'appelant est invoqu\u00e9 dans l'expos\u00e9 de r\u00e9clamation et a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit au cours de l'enqu\u00eate. Le jugement port\u00e9 en appel devant nous ne r\u00e9f\u00e8re en aucune fa\u00e7on \u00e0 l'article 6 (2) en question.\nC'est \u00e9videmment l'article qui doit r\u00e9gir le pr\u00e9sent litige. Il s'agit d'une mesure de guerre qui doit pr\u00e9valoir sur toute l\u00e9gislation provinciale pendant le temps de guerre et, \u00e0 plus forte raison, sur les arr\u00eats qui ont pu \u00eatre rendus en France, ou en Angleterre, non pas sur le point parti- culier de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de l'article 6 (2) (qui autorise le S\u00e9questre \u00e0 d\u00e9l\u00e9guer ses pouvoirs dans les circonstances), mais sur le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral bien connu que nul ne peut plaider avec le nom d'autrui, si ce n'est le souverain par ses officiers reconnus.\nIci, nous avons un texte bien pr\u00e9cis qui permettait au S\u00e9questre de transmettre ses pouvoirs \u00e0 l'appelant et ce texte doit forc\u00e9ment pr\u00e9valoir sur tout principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral applicable en temps de paix.\nJe conclus donc de tout cela que l'action de l'appelant aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre accueillie et que l'appel doit, en cons\u00e9quence, \u00eatre maintenu. D'autre part, il n'est plus utile d'accorder l'\u00e9mission d'une injonction, parce que les articles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduits et l'injonction n'aurait donc aucun effet: mais l'appelant a droit aux d\u00e9clarations qu'il demande dans les paragraphes 1) et 2) des conclusions de son expos\u00e9 de r\u00e9clamation et au paiement des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats qu'il a r\u00e9clam\u00e9s, sauf la somme de vingt-cinq dollars relative \u00e0 Yves Simon, dont le demandeur s'est d\u00e9sist\u00e9 au cours du proc\u00e8s en Cour de l'Echiquier.\nQuant au paragraphe 5) de ses conclusions, demandant une ordonnance obligeant l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 remettre \u00e0 l'appelant les exemplaires contrefaits des ouvrages qui font l'objet de la r\u00e9clamation, ou de lui en payer la valeur \u00e9quivalente, cette demande n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9e lors de l'argumentation devant cette Cour, et il n'y a donc pas lieu de la discuter.\nLe maintien de l'appel comporte \u00e9videmment la condamnation de l'intim\u00e9 au paiement des frais de l'appelant, tant devant la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada que devant la Cour de premi\u00e8re instance.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Taschereau, Estey and Locke JJ. was delivered by\u2014\nTaschereau, J.:\u2014Le demandeur r\u00e9clame du d\u00e9fendeur des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour violation de Droits d'Auteurs, qu'il \u00e9value \u00e0 la somme de $359.50. Il demande \u00e9galement une d\u00e9claration que certains auteurs fran\u00e7ais dont les noms sont mentionn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'action, sont propri\u00e9taires des \u0153uvres reproduites dans la revue du d\u00e9fendeur, \"Aujourd'hui\", et une injonction interdisant \u00e0 ce dernier de publier \u00e0 l'avenir aucune de leurs compositions litt\u00e9raires.\nLe demandeur est le repr\u00e9sentant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral au Canada de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Gens de Lettres de France, dont le but est de prot\u00e9ger les droits litt\u00e9raires de ses adh\u00e9rents, et il all\u00e8gue dans son action que dans le cours des mois de janvier, f\u00e9vrier, mars et avril 1942, et en mars 1943, le d\u00e9fendeur aurait publi\u00e9 sans autorisation des articles dont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 litt\u00e9raire appartient \u00e0 certains membres de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. En reproduisant ainsi ces articles ill\u00e9galement, le d\u00e9fendeur aurait frustr\u00e9 ces \u00e9crivains fran\u00e7ais de leur l\u00e9gitime revenu, et aurait exploit\u00e9 ces \u0153uvres litt\u00e9raires \u00e0 son profit personnel.\nLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 litt\u00e9raire est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e au Canada par la loi concernant le \"Droit d'Auteur\" (S.R.C., 1927, chap. 32). En vertu des dispositions de cette loi, toute \u0153uvre originale litt\u00e9raire, dramatique, musicale ou artistique, ne peut \u00eatre reproduite au. Canada, si \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de la cr\u00e9ation de l'\u0153uvre, son auteur \u00e9tait sujet d'un pays \u00e9tranger ayant adh\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la Convention de Berne. Il s'ensuit que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 litt\u00e9raire des sujets fran\u00e7ais jouit de cette protection au Canada, la France \u00e9tant partie \u00e0 cette Convention, et que personne ne peut, sans encourir les sanctions de la loi, reproduire ici les \u0153uvres litt\u00e9raires d'un sujet fran\u00e7ais.\nL'intim\u00e9 ne nie pas avoir publi\u00e9 les articles en question, mais a soumis plusieurs d\u00e9fenses qui pour la plupart ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillies par le juge au proc\u00e8s. Mais avant de les analyser, il est n\u00e9cessaire de signaler que lors de l'invasion de la France par l'Allemagne au cours de la derni\u00e8re guerre, le Gouvernement Canadien a publi\u00e9 un Ordre en Conseil, en date du 31 juillet 1940, portant le num\u00e9ro 3515, stipulant qu'\u00e0 partir du 21 juin 1940, les dispositions des \"R\u00e8glements sur le Commerce avec l'Ennemi\", de 1939, (Ordre en Conseil n\u00b0 3959), ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tendues et appliqu\u00e9es \u00e0 tout le territoire fran\u00e7ais en Europe, ainsi qu'aux territoires adjacents d'Andorre et de Monaco, et \u00e0 la zone fran\u00e7aise au Maroc, \u00e0 la Corse, \u00e0 l'Alg\u00e9rie et \u00e0 la Tunisie. Comme cons\u00e9quence de l'application \u00e0 la France de ces r\u00e8glements, ce pays fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9 pays \"ennemi\", et toute personne qui y r\u00e9sidait durant l'occupation allemande \u00e9tait l\u00e9galement un \"ennemi\". L'article 21 stipulait que tout \"bien\" appartenant \u00e0 des \"ennemis\" dans les limites de notre pays, devenait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du S\u00e9questre officiel, et \u00e9tait assuj\u00e9ti \u00e0 son contr\u00f4le. Le mot \"biens\" est d\u00e9fini \u00e0 l'article 1, para, (h) des r\u00e8glements de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\n(h) \"biens\" aux termes des pr\u00e9sents r\u00e8glements vise et comprend toute propri\u00e9t\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re et personnelle de quelque nature que ce soit ainsi que tous les droits et int\u00e9r\u00eats qui s'y rattachent, en droit ou en \u00e9quit\u00e9, et, sans restreindre la port\u00e9e de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, toutes valeurs, dettes, cr\u00e9ances, comptes et droits incorporels.\nLes auteurs dont les ouvrages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduits dans la Revue dont le d\u00e9fendeur-intim\u00e9 est le propri\u00e9taire, \u00e9taient donc des \"ennemis\" au moment o\u00f9 les r\u00e8glements \u00e9taient en vigueur, et tous leurs biens et leurs droits sont devenus par la seule op\u00e9ration de la loi, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du S\u00e9questre officiel.\nIl ne me semble pas possible de douter qu'un \"droit d'auteur\", qui est un droit mobilier, incorporel, qui assure tous les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices que comporte une cr\u00e9ation litt\u00e9raire, et qui permet de recourir aux tribunaux pour le faire respecter, soit un \"bien\", au sens du r\u00e8glement.\nOn pr\u00e9tend que le demandeur n'a pas l'int\u00e9r\u00eat voulu pour instituer la pr\u00e9sente action, parce qu'on ne peut pas plaider au nom d'autrui. Ce principe est tr\u00e8s vrai \u00e0 condition qu'il trouve son application. Contrairement \u00e0 ce qu'on a dit, le demandeur n'a pas institu\u00e9 cette action devant la Cour d'\u00c9chiquier, en sa qualit\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentant ou de mandataire de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Auteurs Fran\u00e7ais, ni m\u00eame en sa qualit\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentant des auteurs individuellement. Si tel \u00e9tait le cas, la situation juridique des parties pourrait \u00eatre enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rente. Mais M. de Montigny se pr\u00e9sente devant le tribunal, porteur d'une autorisation sign\u00e9e par le S\u00e9questre officiel, ce m\u00eame S\u00e9questre qui, par l'effet des r\u00e8glements \"Sur le Commerce avec l'Ennemi\", est propri\u00e9taire de l'ensemble des \"Droits\" de ceux dont les \u00e9crits ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduits, et qui en a le monopole et la ma\u00eetrise absolue. Cette autorisation qui porte la date du 17 avril 1943, \u00e9crite en anglais, et sign\u00e9e de M. E. H. Coleman, se lit ainsi:\nAUTHORIZATION\nThe Custodian of Enemy Property, by his duly authorized Deputy, Ephraim Herbert Coleman, under the Consolidated Regulations Respecting Trading with the Enemy (1939) being vested with the rights of Andr\u00e9 Desqueyrat, Georges Bernanos, Louis Hourtioq, Jacques Darcy, Bernard de Peck, Charles Fiessinger, J. E. Janot, Henri Gh\u00e9on and Yves-R. Simon, their heirs and assigns, and\/or La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Gens de Lettres, a body politic and corporate duly incorporated under the laws of the Republic of France and having its head office and principal place of business in the City of Paris, France, hereby authorizes Mr. Louvigny de Mon-tigny, of the City of Ottawa, in the Province of Ontario, general representative and Attorney in Canada of the said La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Gens de Lettres, to institute action in the Exchequer Court of Canada against Reverend Father Jacques Cousineau, of the Society of Jesus, for having reproduced without authority the following writings in the magazine \"Aujourd'hui\" during the period from January 1942 to March 1943:\u2014\nCette autorisation donn\u00e9e au demandeur-appelant est claire et pr\u00e9cise. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que depuis le d\u00e9but des hostilit\u00e9s l'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 par le S\u00e9questre officiel de surveiller les reproductions des \u0153uvres litt\u00e9raires fran\u00e7aises, non seulement celles des membres de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Auteurs, mais aussi celles de tous les auteurs fran\u00e7ais. Cette surveillance devait s'exercer pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du S\u00e9questre, propri\u00e9taire des droits d'auteur, et nullement pour les auteurs eux-m\u00eames, qui par l'op\u00e9ration de la loi, n'avaient plus de droits \u00e0 faire valoir. Cette preuve est amplement confirm\u00e9e par une lettre \u00e9crite \u00e0 l'appelant quelques mois apr\u00e8s l'institution de la pr\u00e9sente action, mais avant la production de la d\u00e9fense, par le S\u00e9questre adjoint M. A. H. Mathieu et produite comme exhibit \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate, M. Mathieu r\u00e9affirme l'autorisation ant\u00e9rieure donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appelant, de percevoir les droits provenant de l'utilisation au Canada, des ouvrages des auteurs en territoire ennemi, pour le. b\u00e9n\u00e9fice et avantage du S\u00e9questre. Il est clairement stipul\u00e9 que les fonds per\u00e7us doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans un compte sp\u00e9cial \"bloqu\u00e9\" \u00e0 la Banque Canadienne Nationale, qui doit faire rapport au S\u00e9questre lui-m\u00eame. M. Mathieu rappelle enfin que le mandat conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant de percevoir ainsi des droits d'auteur, lui est donn\u00e9 en vertu du paragraphe 6 (2) de l'Ordre en Conseil 3959 (R\u00e8glements sur le Commerce avec l'Ennemi) qui sera cit\u00e9 au long, et qui d\u00e9montre bien que l'appelant a per\u00e7u tous les droits et institu\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente action, pour le compte du S\u00e9questre et non pas pour celui des auteurs.\nL'article 47, para. 3, n'a pas d'application. Il couvre le cas o\u00f9 une r\u00e9clamation est exerc\u00e9e contre un sujet, habitant un pays ennemi, et stipule que personne ne pourra poursuivre ou continuer une action d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9e, sans l'autorisation \u00e9crite du S\u00e9questre. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, l'action n'est pas institu\u00e9e contre un sujet fran\u00e7ais, niais est pour faire valoir des droits de citoyens fran\u00e7ais, dont le S\u00e9questre est investi, contre un citoyen canadien.\nLes deux articles suivants des r\u00e8glements \u00e9tablissent en premier lieu que le S\u00e9questre officiel avait personnellement le droit de poursuivre, et qu'il avait en second lieu, le droit d'autoriser toute personne de son choix \u00e0 poursuivre \u00e9galement.\nL'article 36, para. 1, de l'Ordre en Conseil 3959 (R\u00e8glements sur le Commerce avec l'Ennemi) se lit ainsi:\n36. (1) Lorsqu'une personne n\u00e9glige de payer au S\u00e9questre une somme qui lui est payable en vertu des pr\u00e9sents r\u00e8glements, ce dernier peut intenter des proc\u00e9dures devant la Cour de l'Echiquier du Canada pour le recouvrement de ladite somme.\nEn vertu de l'article 6, para. 2 du m\u00eame Ordre en Conseil, le S\u00e9questre peut d\u00e9l\u00e9guer tout pouvoir qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9. Cet article est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans les termes suivants:\n6. (2) Tout pouvoir accord\u00e9 ou devoir impos\u00e9 en vertu ou sous le r\u00e9gime des pr\u00e9sente r\u00e8glements au secr\u00e9taire d'\u00c9tat et\/ou au S\u00e9questre peut \u00eatre d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 par lui \u00e0 la personne ou aux personnes qu'il juge appropri\u00e9es.\nIl s'ensuit logiquement que le S\u00e9questre, propri\u00e9taire de ces droits d'auteurs, ayant le droit de poursuivre pour en r\u00e9clamer les avantages p\u00e9cuniaires et la r\u00e9paration du pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9, pouvait autoriser le demandeur-appelant \u00e0 instituer la pr\u00e9sente action.\nLe texte anglais du document sign\u00e9 par le S\u00e9questre dit que \"E. H. Coleman being vested with the rights of \u2026\" \"hereby authorizes Louvigny de Montigny \u2026 to institute action\u2026\". Le mot \"authorize\" n'est pas le mot que l'on retrouve \u00e0 l'article 6 (2) qui dit que \"any power \u2026 may be delegated \u2026\". Mais je crois que ces deux expressions ont le m\u00eame sens, et que l'autorisation donn\u00e9e constitue v\u00e9ritablement une d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de pouvoirs. \"To authorize\") veut sans doute dire \"donner le droit \u00e0 quelqu'un de faire quelque chose qu'on a soi-m\u00eame le droit de faire\". \"Auto-riser\" est donc \"d\u00e9l\u00e9guer son pouvoir\". \"To authorize\" c'est \"to endow with authority\", et \"authority' c'est le \"derived or delegated power\" (Oxford English Dictionary). L'autorisation donn\u00e9e me semble donc suffisante, et la pr\u00e9tention que le demandeur n'a pas l'int\u00e9r\u00eat voulu pour instituer les pr\u00e9sentes proc\u00e9dures doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nLa seconde pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9 est que les effets de la Convention de Berne ont \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendus depuis le 21 juin 1940, date o\u00f9 la France a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e pays \"ennemi\". L'argument invoqu\u00e9 est qu'en vertu du Droit International Public, un sujet r\u00e9sidant dans un pays ennemi, n'a aucun droit, durant l'existence de l'\u00e9tat de guerre, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence les Auteurs Fran\u00e7ais dont les droits auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9s au Canada, ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaient pas de la protection litt\u00e9raire que la Convention leur avait assur\u00e9e. En reproduisant leurs \u00e9crits, le d\u00e9fendeur n'enfreignait aucune loi, et le S\u00e9questre officiel n'\u00e9tant investi d'aucun droit ne pouvait autoriser personne \u00e0 poursuivre le d\u00e9fendeur.\nIl n'y a pas de doute que certains auteurs ont exprim\u00e9 l'opinion que l'\u00e9tat de guerre suspend entre les pays bellig\u00e9rants les protections que les Trait\u00e9s ou Conventions internationales peuvent accorder. Le Trait\u00e9 de Versailles lui-m\u00eame, sign\u00e9 le 28 juin 1919, semble confirmer cette th\u00e9orie, car \u00e0 l'article 286 on voit que les nations signataires d\u00e9clarent que la Convention de Berne redevient en force, le jour de la signature du Trait\u00e9. Le d\u00e9fendeur conclut que si la Convention de Berne \u00e9tait demeur\u00e9e en vigueur durant les hostilit\u00e9s, il n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de la faire revivre \u00e0 la fin de la guerre.\nL'article 4 de la loi concernant le \"Droit d'Auteur\" se lit ainsi:\n4. Subordonn\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente loi, le droit d'auteur existe au Canada, pendant la dur\u00e9e mentionn\u00e9e ci-apr\u00e8s, sur toute \u0153uvre originale litt\u00e9raire, dramatique, musicale ou artistique, si, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de la cr\u00e9ation de l'\u0153uvre, l'auteur \u00e9tait sujet britannique, citoyen ou sujet d'un pays \u00e9tranger ayant adh\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la Convention et au Protocole additionnel de cette m\u00eame Convention, publi\u00e9s dans la seconde annexe de la pr\u00e9sente loi, ou avait son domicile dans les possessions de Sa Majest\u00e9. Il semblerait qu'en vertu de ce texte la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 litt\u00e9raire des auteurs fran\u00e7ais est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e au Canada, non pas \u00e0 cause des termes de la Convention de Berne, mais comme cons\u00e9quence de cet article 4, qui est la loi domestique du pays. La Convention identifie les pays dont les sujets jouiront de la protection litt\u00e9raire, mais c'est le texte de notre loi qui l'assure d\u00e9finitivement, et en consacre l'existence. Mais cette th\u00e9orie, m\u00eame si elle \u00e9tait juridiquement fond\u00e9e, ne s'applique pas \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause, et il est en cons\u00e9quence inutile de chercher \u00e0 l'approfondir davantage.\nEn 1939, le Gouverneur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral en Conseil a en effet pass\u00e9, s'autorisant de la Loi des Mesures de Guerre, un Ordre en Conseil (N\u00b0 3362) intitul\u00e9 \"Arr\u00eat\u00e9 exceptionnel sur les brevets, les dessins de fabrique, le droit d'auteur et les marques de commerce\". Cet Arr\u00eat\u00e9 Minist\u00e9riel contient entre autres l'article 8, qui se lit ainsi:\n8. (1) Par d\u00e9rogation aux dispositions des R\u00e8glements sur le commerce avec l'ennemi, 1939, des R\u00e8glements concernant la d\u00e9fense du Canada, 1939, ou de toute r\u00e8gle de droit visant les relations ou les rapports avec des ennemis ou pour leur compte, les dispositions de l'article 4 de la Loi du droit d'auteur, chapitre 32 des Statuts revis\u00e9s du Canada, 1927, sont cens\u00e9es, pour les fins de cette loi, rester en vigueur nonobstant l'\u00e9tat de guerre, sous r\u00e9serve de toute modification dont elles peuvent \u00eatre l'objet sous le r\u00e9gime de ladite loi.\n(2) Par d\u00e9rogation aux dispositions des R\u00e8glements sur le commerce avec l'ennemi, 1939, des R\u00e8glements concernant la d\u00e9fense du Canada, 1939, ou de toute r\u00e8gle de droit visant les relations ou les rapports avec des ennemis ou pour leur compte, tout droit d'auteur qui aurait exist\u00e9 en vertu de l'article 4 pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 de la Loi du droit d'auteur, chapitre 32 des Statuts revis\u00e9s du Canada, 1927, si le propri\u00e9taire du droit d'auteur n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un ennemi, doit \u00eatre maintenu de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re lorsqu'un ennemi, soit seul, soit conjointement avec une autre personne, en est le propri\u00e9taire.\nToutefois, lorsqu'un ennemi, soit seul, soit conjointement avec une autre personne, est le propri\u00e9taire du droit d'auteur existant sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi du droit d'auteur, chapitre 32 des Statuts revis\u00e9s du Canada, 1927, les dispositions des r\u00e8glements sur le commerce avec l'ennemi, 1939, des . R\u00e8glements concernant la d\u00e9fense du Canada, 1939, et de toute autre loi visant les relations ou les rapports avec des ennemis ou pour' leur compte, ou les biens, droits ou capacit\u00e9 des ennemis, et toute r\u00e8gle de droit se rapportant \u00e0 l'une quelconque de ces mati\u00e8res, doivent, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de cet ennemi, \u00eatre op\u00e9rantes relativement au droit d'auteur ainsi maintenu.\nOn voit donc que l'article 4 de la loi du \"Droit d'Auteur\" est maintenu malgr\u00e9 l'existence de la guerre, et que comme r\u00e9sultat, la protection litt\u00e9raire continue \u00e0 \u00eatre accord\u00e9e aux adh\u00e9rents de la Convention de Berne. Le dernier paragraphe de cet article que je viens de reproduire est . particuli\u00e8rement significatif. Apr\u00e8s que l'Arr\u00eat\u00e9 Minist\u00e9riel e\u00fbt clairement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que \"les dispositions de l'article 4 de la Loi du \"Droit d'Auteur\" sont cens\u00e9es rester en vigueur, nonobstant l'\u00e9tat de guerre,\" il stipule que lorsqu'un ennemi est propri\u00e9taire d'un droit d'auteur, les dispositions des R\u00e8glements sur le Commerce avec l'Ennemi \"doivent \u00eatre op\u00e9rantes relativement au droit d'auteur ainsi maintenu\". Ceci signifie que tous les biens d'un \"ennemi\", y compris ses droits d'auteur, deviennent la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 exclusive du S\u00e9questre, et que tous les pouvoirs que ce dernier poss\u00e8de, dont celui de poursuivre, peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans le cas actuel.\nLe droit International Public n'a pas la primaut\u00e9; c'est la loi domestique du pays qui doit \u00eatre souveraine. Si m\u00eame comme r\u00e9sultat de l'existence de l'\u00e9tat de guerre, les dispositions de la Convention de Berne ont \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendues, je n'ai pas de doute que les droits d'auteur des citoyens fran\u00e7ais ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formellement reconnus par l'Ordre en Conseil que je viens de citer, et qui, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9, avait force de loi.\nL'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend aussi qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 par certains de ces auteurs fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 publier les articles qu'il a reproduits. Dans certains cas, l'autorisation aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 expresse, et dans un autre, elle proviendrait de ce que le d\u00e9fendeur et l'auteur, faisant tous deux partie de la Compagnie de J\u00e9sus, seraient li\u00e9s par un r\u00e8glement de l'Ordre, permettant \u00e0 un J\u00e9suite de publier les \u00e9crits d'un confr\u00e8re. M\u00eame si la preuve de ces faits avait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement \u00e9tablie, la pr\u00e9tention de l'intim\u00e9 ne serait pas fond\u00e9e. Qu'il suffise de dire pour en disposer, que tous ces auteurs fran\u00e7ais ne pouvaient donner semblable autorisation. \"Ennemis\" au sens de la loi, ils \u00e9taient d\u00e9pouill\u00e9s de leurs droits, et ils \u00e9taient incomp\u00e9tents \u00e0 donner aucun consentement. Les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices que comportaient leurs droits d'auteur \u00e9taient la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du S\u00e9questre officiel, qui seul avait l'autorit\u00e9 voulue pour les percevoir et en disposer \u00e0 volont\u00e9.\nL'intim\u00e9 soutient enfin qu'ayant publi\u00e9 ces articles de bonne foi, il ne peut \u00eatre condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 des dommages. En vertu des dispositions de l'article 22, il n'y aurait lieu qu'\u00e0 une injonction pour emp\u00eacher toute reproduction future. Les avertissements donn\u00e9s au d\u00e9fendeur, et la correspondance qu'il a \u00e9chang\u00e9e avec l'appelant, ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la publication des articles qui font l'objet de ce litige, disposent de ce moyen de d\u00e9fense.\nUne derni\u00e8re observation s'impose. Au d\u00e9but de ce jugement, j'ai signal\u00e9 ce que r\u00e9clame le demandeur dans son action. Je n'ai pas de doute qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement \u00e9tabli que le droit \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 litt\u00e9raire des articles publi\u00e9s dans la revue \"Aujourd'hui\", a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9 par le d\u00e9fendeur, et que ce dernier a priv\u00e9 le S\u00e9questre officiel des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices p\u00e9cuniaires auxquels il avait droit. Mais je ne crois pas qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire d'incorporer semblable d\u00e9claration dans le jugement formel. La condamnation p\u00e9cuniaire comporte la constatation de la violation de ces \"Droits d\u2019Auteur\".\nQuant \u00e0 l'injonction demand\u00e9e, il me semble impossible de l'accorder. Le demandeur en effet, r\u00e9clame pour le S\u00e9questre officiel, dont les fonctions sont maintenant termin\u00e9es, la France n'\u00e9tant plus pays \"ennemi\". Cette Cour ne peut pas ordonner au d\u00e9fendeur de cesser \u00e0 l'avenir de violer un droit dont le demandeur n'est plus investi. Il appartiendra aux int\u00e9ress\u00e9s de s'adresser aux tribunaux si le d\u00e9fendeur persiste \u00e0 ne pas respecter des droits dont ils ont maintenant la compl\u00e8te jouissance. Le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 est de $359.50, et ce montant, vu la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte, me para\u00eet une compensation raisonnable pour r\u00e9parer le pr\u00e9judice subi, sauf qu'il faudra d\u00e9duire une somme de $25, montant originairement r\u00e9clam\u00e9 pour les reproductions litt\u00e9raires de Yves Simon et dont le demandeur s'est d\u00e9sist\u00e9 \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu, l'action accueillie jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de la somme de $334.50, avec int\u00e9r\u00eats, et les d\u00e9pens des deux cours contre l'intim\u00e9.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Parisien, Chartrand & Bonneau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Perrault & Perrault.\n1 [1948] Ex.

To her daughter, the predecessor in title of the respondent she left the adjoining lower lands including a flour and sawmill and a right to water power sufficient to operate them. These properties are situate on the de Lottinville River and some four miles below the retenue erected across the Laval River for the purpose of diverting some of its water into the de Lottinville River. Para. 7 of the will states: \"Ma fille Zo\u00e9 aura le droit de se faire fournir par mon fils Louis, \u00e0 m\u00eame le pouvoir d'eau de la manufacture, l'eau n\u00e9cessaire pour faire fonctionner les moulins\u2026\" Appellant contended that the right to receive the water power given to the daughter was a personal right only against the son and could not be asserted against the appellant and also that as the will was not registered in the district in which the retenue lies, it could not be assented against him. The respondent contended on the other hand that the will created a real servitude and that (the appellant was obliged to maintain the retenue in repair. The majority in the Court of Appeal held that the will created a real servitude.\nHeld: (The Chief Justice and Kerwin J. dissenting) that, what was bequeathed was a real servitude for the benefit of the lower lands, of which the obligation to repair was part and parcel of the entire servitude imposed upon the properties devised to the son.\nHeld: Even though the right to maintain the retenue is a servitude, the will did not create a servitude upon a servitude as the servitude created is upon the retenue itself which is owned by the appellant.\nHeld: Appellant cannot complain that the will was not registered as this would be a denial of his own source of title.\nPer The Chief Justice and Kerwin J. (dissenting) : From the language used in the will, it is impossible to deduct that the testatrix had the intention to create a real servitude. Assuming the intention to create a real servitude, as she did not follow the prescriptions of the Code requiring on the part of the servient land that the servitude be passive and not active, and also that the use and extent of it be determined by the title creating the servitude, the result is a personal obligation on the part of the son. APPEAL from, the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, dismissing, Marchand JA. dissenting, the appeal from the decision of the Superior Court, Boulanger J., holding that a real servitude had been created by the will.\nCharles Cannon, K.C., for the appellant.\nJacques Lapointe for the respondent.\nThe dissenting judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin J. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014Cette cause d\u00e9pend essentiellement de l'interpr\u00e9tation que l'on doit donner au testament fait le 5 janvier 1925 par Madame Zo\u00e9 Turgeon-Richard en faveur de son fils Louis et sa fille Zo\u00e9.\nPar son testament elle l\u00e9guait \u00e0 son fils Louis sa manufacture de carton situ\u00e9e \u00e0 l'Ange Gardien, avec les terrains y attenant et les b\u00e2tisses \u00e9rig\u00e9es sur ces terrains et servant \u00e0 l'exploitation de la manufacture. Le legs suit en ces termes :\nJe lui donne et l\u00e8gue avec dispense de rapport le pouvoir d'eau de la retenue et ce qui sert \u00e0 l'exploiter tel que chauss\u00e9es, digues, ainsi que la maison appel\u00e9e power house.

Il suffit de mentionner que l'appelant \u00e9tait, lors de l'institution de cette cause, le propri\u00e9taire des immeubles l\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e0 Louis Richard et l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait la propri\u00e9taire des immeubles l\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e0 Zo\u00e9 Richard, la fille de la testatrice.\nL'action fut institu\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e all\u00e9guant que le pouvoir d'eau ou barrage de la retenue \u00e9tait dans un \u00e9tat de v\u00e9tust\u00e9 d\u00e9plorable et que, par suite de ce mauvais \u00e9tat, l'eau s'\u00e9chappait en grande quantit\u00e9 dans une direction autre que celle des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de l'intim\u00e9e, \"la privant en cons\u00e9quence d'une partie du pouvoir dont elle aurait besoin pour son moulin, \u00e0 tel point qu'elle en est priv\u00e9e presque compl\u00e8tement pendant les p\u00e9riodes de s\u00e9cheresse, dommages qu'elle n'aurait point \u00e0 subir si le barrage \u00e9tait \u00e9tanche\".\nIl est important de constater quelles sont les conclusions de l'action de l'intim\u00e9e. Elle a conclu\n\u00e0 ce que, par le jugement \u00e0 intervenir, il soit dit et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la demanderesse a droit de recevoir toutes les eaux de la rivi\u00e8re Ferr\u00e9e et de Lottinville n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'op\u00e9ration de son moulin \u00e0 farine situ\u00e9 sur les lots 421 et 422 du cadastre officiel pour la paroisse de Ch\u00e2teau-Richer; que le d\u00e9fendeur, comme propri\u00e9taire du barrage et du pouvoir d'eau, est oblig\u00e9 de faire au barrage les travaux de r\u00e9parations et d'entretien n\u00e9cessaires pour fournir \u00e0 la demanderesse l'eau dont elle a besoin pour son moulin et \u00e0 ce que le d\u00e9fendeur soit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 faire au dit barrage les r\u00e9parations n\u00e9cessaires pour en assurer la solidit\u00e9 et l'\u00e9tanch\u00e9it\u00e9 et pour assurer un d\u00e9bit constant au moulin de la demanderesse.\nLes conclusions de la d\u00e9claration ajoutent une demande qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9faut par le d\u00e9fendeur de faire les travaux requis dans les quinze jours du jugement \u00e0 intervenir \"la demanderesse soit autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 entrer chez le d\u00e9fendeur pour faire les dits travaux aux frais du d\u00e9fendeur, le tout avec d\u00e9pens contre le d\u00e9fendeur, la demanderesse se r\u00e9servant tous autres recours contre le d\u00e9fendeur pour les dommages subis.\"\nLe jugement de premi\u00e8re instance est \u00e0 l'effet que la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 sans l'ombre d'un doute que le barrage \u00e9tait en tr\u00e8s mauvaise condition et qu'il laissait fuir dans la rivi\u00e8re Laval un quart de l'eau qui serait cens\u00e9 se d\u00e9verser dans la rivi\u00e8re de Lottinville; qu'il avait besoin de r\u00e9parations urgentes et imm\u00e9diates qui co\u00fbteraient $2,500; et trouve que l'action de la demanderesse \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e; \"que le barrage de la Retenue, appartenant au d\u00e9fendeur, est assujetti par et en vertu du testament de Zo\u00e9 Turgeon-Richard, du 5 janvier 1925, \u00e0 une servitude en faveur du moulin \u00e0 farine et du moulin \u00e0 scie de la demanderesse situ\u00e9s sur parties des lots 421 et 422 du cadastre de Ch\u00e2teau-Richer et sur le lot num\u00e9ro 2 du cadastre de l'Ange-Gardien; que cette servitude consiste \u00e0 fournir aux dits moulins l'usage et l'eau retenue et d\u00e9tourn\u00e9e par ce barrage\". Il maintient en cons\u00e9quence les conclusions de la demanderesse et d\u00e9clare que la demanderesse a droit de recevoir toutes les eaux des rivi\u00e8res Ferr\u00e9e et de Lottinville n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'op\u00e9ration de son moulin \u00e0 farine situ\u00e9 sur les lots 421 et 422 du cadastre officiel pour la paroisse de Ch\u00e2teau-Richer; et d\u00e9clare que le d\u00e9fendeur, comme propri\u00e9taire du barrage du pouvoir d'eau, est oblig\u00e9 de faire au barrage les travaux de r\u00e9parations et d'entretien n\u00e9cessaires pour fournir \u00e0 la demanderesse l'eau dont elle a besoin pour son moulin et condamne le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 faire audit barrage les r\u00e9parations n\u00e9cessaires \u2026 pour assurer un d\u00e9bit d'eau constant au moulin de la demanderesse\"; \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de quoi, dans les quinze jours du jugement, la demanderesse est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 faire ces travaux et \u00e0 entrer chez le d\u00e9fendeur pour les faire, aux frais du d\u00e9fendeur; le tout avec d\u00e9pens.\nCe jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) 2 dans les termes suivants\nConsid\u00e9rant que la preuve documentaire et orale vers\u00e9e au dossier justifie les conclusions prises par la demanderesse en son action confessoire de servitude, et c'est \u00e0 bon droit qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillies par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure;\nl'appel du d\u00e9fendeur est rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nCe jugement de la Cour s'appuie en somme sur les notes de M. le Juge Saint-Jacques, \u00e0 l'opinion de qui les autres juges se sont ralli\u00e9s, \u00e0 l'exception de l'honorable juge Marchand qui exprime sa dissidence en vertu du principe que le testament n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 au d\u00e9sir de la loi sur l'immeuble o\u00f9 la servitude \u00e9tait r\u00e9clam\u00e9e et qu'en cons\u00e9quence il avait perdu toute efficacit\u00e9 comme acte constitutif de telle servitude.\nIl convient de faire remarquer imm\u00e9diatement que la d\u00e9claration de la demanderesse, ni d'ailleurs ses conclusions n'invoque pas l'existence d'une servitude r\u00e9elle. Ce n'est que dans les jugements que l'on voit appara\u00eetre cette description des obligations respectives et des droits des \"h\u00e9ritages\" l'un sur l'autre. A lire les all\u00e9gations de la demanderesse, l'on ne saurait \u00e9viter de remarquer qu'elle a r\u00e9ellement bas\u00e9 ses pr\u00e9tentions sur une obligation personnelle de Louis Richard, r\u00e9sultant du testament dont il s'agit.\nIl n'est nullement question dans ce document, qui fait la base de l'action, d'une charge impos\u00e9e sur l'h\u00e9ritage de Louis Richard pour l'utilit\u00e9 de l'h\u00e9ritage l\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 sa fille Zo\u00e9 par la testatrice, ainsi que l'exige l'article 499 du Code Civil.\nIl n'y est pas dit que le barrage de la retenue est affect\u00e9 d'une charge en faveur des moulins \u00e0 scie et \u00e0 farine donn\u00e9e \u00e0 la fille Zo\u00e9 par le testament en question; mais on y parle des obligations de Louis Richard qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 assum\u00e9es par l'appelant.\nOr, cela est inexact; l'appelant n'a pas assum\u00e9 les obligations de Louis Richard de fournir aux moulins de Zo\u00e9 l'eau qui peut \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire pour les faire fonctionner. Bien au contraire, sur ce point, le titre de l'appelant est plus clair que le testament. L'acqu\u00e9reur de la faillite de Louis Richard n'assume aucune obligation. L'acte stipule simplement que Dame Oz\u00e9lia Doyon \"aura droit cependant de se servir du dit pouvoir d'eau en aval de la manufacture pour l'entretien du moulin \u00e0 farine, du moulin \u00e0 scie ainsi que du Power House et de ses b\u00e2timents actuels sis et situ\u00e9s sur les lots num\u00e9ros 421 et 422 du cadastre de Ch\u00e2teau-Richer\". L'on remarque, qu'ici encore, il est question \"du pouvoir d'eau en aval de la manufacture\". Ce pouvoir d'eau ne saurait \u00eatre le barrage de la retenue qui est situ\u00e9 \u00e0 quatre milles en amont de la manufacture.\nLes obligations assum\u00e9es par Coulombe dans le contrat de vente que lui a consenti le syndic \u00e0 la faillite de Louis Richard sont si peu favorables \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation que la demanderesse veut maintenant donner au testament, dont nous nous occupons, que le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance et la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel), afin d'arriver \u00e0 leurs conclusions, ont d\u00fb d\u00e9gager la demanderesse des cons\u00e9quences des stipulations contenues dans cet acte de vente en faisant remarquer que ni la demanderesse, ni son auteur, n'\u00e9tait partie \u00e0 cet acte et que, par cons\u00e9quent, cet acte ne pouvait \"en aucune fa\u00e7on lier la demanderesse\".\nSi l'on s'en tenait aux stipulations de l'acte de vente par la faillite \u00e0 l'appelant actuel, les jugements dont est appel ne pourraient tenir.\nC'est donc uniquement du testament que l'intim\u00e9e peut se r\u00e9clamer pour maintenir les pr\u00e9tentions qu'elle \u00e9met maintenant, et, l'action qu'elle a prise n'est pas une action confessoire de servitude r\u00e9elle sur le barrage de la retenue; c'est clairement une action bas\u00e9e sur l'obligation personnelle de Louis Richard, \u00e0 laquelle la demanderesse all\u00e9gua que Coulombe a succ\u00e9d\u00e9. Bien loin de trouver dans l'acte d'acquisition de Coulombe une clause par laquelle il aurait assum\u00e9 cette obligation, on y trouve la d\u00e9claration suivante: \"Le vendeur d\u00e9clare, sous la peine de droit, que les lots et le pouvoir d'eau ci-dessus vendus sont libres de toute hypoth\u00e8que et charges quelconques, mais vend les dites propri\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00e0 charge de cens et rentes qui pourraient les affecter.\"\nSuit, dans cette vente, toute une nomenclature de servitudes actives et passives (que le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance mentionne qu'il est impossible d'identifier faute de plan), mais o\u00f9 l'on chercherait vainement l'\u00e9tablissement d'une servitude sur le barrage de la retenue.\nCertes, je m'accorde avec le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance pour dire que \"le testament, malheureusement, a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans des termes lamentablement vagues et impr\u00e9cis\". Mais je cesse de m'accorder lorsqu'il dit \"qu'on peut sortir en dehors du testament pour d\u00e9couvrir l'intention v\u00e9ritable de la testatrice\".\nL'on cite certains jugements, qui ne sont pas dans des causes de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, o\u00f9 il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 dit que l'on ne devait pas s'en tenir aux termes m\u00eames du document, mais que l'on doit plut\u00f4t rechercher l'intention de la testatrice sans s'arr\u00eater au langage qu'elle a employ\u00e9. Tout d'abord, cette pr\u00e9tention est diam\u00e9tralement contraire \u00e0 l'article 101.3 du Code Civil, qui ne permet pas de s'\u00e9carter du \"sens litt\u00e9ral des termes du contrat\", \u00e0 moins que la commune intention des parties soit douteuse. Mais, en plus, cela est \u00e9galement contraire au jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Auger v. Beaudry 3, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu dans une cause de Qu\u00e9bec, et \u00e0 laquelle j'aurai l'occasion de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer un peu plus loin. Ce jugement fait remarquer qu'il y a eu des h\u00e9sitations au sujet de l'interpr\u00e9tation que l'on devait donner \u00e0 un testament:\nBut whatever wavering from the strict rule of construction may have taken place in the past, it is now recognized that the only safe method of determining what was the real intention of a testator is to give the fair and literal meaning to the actual language of the will.\nL'on remarque que le Conseil Priv\u00e9, dans ce jugement, d\u00e9clare positivement que, nonobstant les jugements qui ont pu \u00eatre rendus au contraire, d\u00e8s lors, c'est-\u00e0-dire, en 1920 et pour le futur, la seule r\u00e8gle qui doit guider l'interpr\u00e9tation des testaments est de s'en tenir au \"sens litt\u00e9ral des termes\". Les tribunaux ne sauraient sp\u00e9culer sur ce que le testament aurait d\u00fb dire, ou sur ce qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9quitable de dire, ou sur ce qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus avantageux de dire; les tribunaux doivent s'en tenir \u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit.\nCe qui importe r\u00e9ellement dans cette cause-ci, c'est donc d'interpr\u00e9ter la clause du testament invoqu\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e strictement d'apr\u00e8s les termes employ\u00e9s dans ce testament.\nEt, si je fais ci-dessus allusion \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont la d\u00e9claration et ses conclusions sont r\u00e9dig\u00e9es, c'est pour indiquer que l'intim\u00e9e elle-m\u00eame, lorsqu'elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'instituer son action contre l'appelant, n'a pas interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 le testament comme ayant constitu\u00e9 une servitude r\u00e9elle et qu'elle invoque seulement une obligation personnelle de la part de Louis Richard.\nIl est \u00e9vident que, si nous avions devant nous une action intent\u00e9e contre ce dernier, la situation serait bien diff\u00e9rente. Mais il faut remarquer que l'on pr\u00e9tend ici imposer \u00e0 un tiers acqu\u00e9reur une charge qui n'est indiqu\u00e9e ni dans le testament, ni dans la d\u00e9claration annex\u00e9e au bref d'assignation, sans \u00eatre capable de trouver dans le testament lui-m\u00eame la cr\u00e9ation d'une servitude r\u00e9elle, et, sans que ce tiers acqu\u00e9reur ait pu d\u00e9couvrir au bureau d'enregistrement qu'il acqu\u00e9rait une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 une servitude r\u00e9elle, et alors que son vendeur, dans le titre d'acquisition, d\u00e9clare, au contraire, positivement, comme je l'ai fait remarquer plus haut, que les lots et le pouvoir d'eau vendus par la faillite de Louis Richard \"sont libres de toute hypoth\u00e8que et charges quelconques\".\nEt, non seulement il n'est pas \u00e9tabli que Coulombe pouvait d\u00e9couvrir au bureau d'enregistrement que cette pr\u00e9tendue servitude \u00e9tait enregistr\u00e9e sur le barrage de la retenue, mais la testatrice elle-m\u00eame d\u00e9clare:\nAttendu que dans mon pr\u00e9sent testament les immeubles que j'y ai l\u00e9gu\u00e9s n'y sont pas d\u00e9sign\u00e9s sous leurs num\u00e9ros de cadastre, et qu'il pourrait peut \u00eatre survenir des malentendus entre mes l\u00e9gataires sur la fixation des limites d'iceux, je veux qu'au cas de toute difficult\u00e9 concernant leur d\u00e9limitation, la d\u00e9cision de mon ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire soit finale et irr\u00e9vocable.\nJe ne me prononcerai pas sur la validit\u00e9 de cette clause, par laquelle elle pr\u00e9tend laisser \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de son ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire la fixation des limites des diff\u00e9rents immeubles l\u00e9gu\u00e9s par elle, autrement que pour faire remarquer, qu'\u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, vu que les malentendus qu'elle pr\u00e9voyait sont survenus, nous n'avons devant nous aucune d\u00e9cision de l'ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire \u00e0 ce sujet. Nous pourrions nous demander, au cas o\u00f9 telle d\u00e9cision aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue, jusqu'\u00e0 quel point le d\u00e9sir de la testatrice que cette d\u00e9cision \"soit finale et irr\u00e9vocable\" lierait les parties en cette cause et devrait \u00eatre reconnu irr\u00e9vocablement par la Cour. Je n'ajouterai aux consid\u00e9rations qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent que cet autre passage tir\u00e9 du jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure :\nVoil\u00e0 pourquoi les anciens titres ne peuvent gu\u00e8re nous aider \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s'il y a servitude actuellement, m\u00eame s'ils peuvent nous aider \u00e0 comprendre quel \u00e9tait l'\u00e9tat de choses avant le testament de Zo\u00e9 Turgeon-Richard.\nEn effet, c'est dans ce testament qui l\u00e8gue le moulin \u00e0 farine \u00e0 la fille de la testatrice, Zo\u00e9 Richard-Savard, et le barrage de la Retenue au fils de la testatrice, Louis Richard, qu'il nous faut trouver la cr\u00e9ation d'une servitude sur l'immeuble du barrage en faveur de l'immeuble de la meunerie, si la demanderesse a raison dans ses pr\u00e9tentions. Il n'y a pas d'autre titre et une servitude ne peut exister sans titre\u2026 Pour qu'il y ait servitude, il suffit que l'on puisse trouver dans le titre constitutif la cr\u00e9ation d'un service impos\u00e9 sur un immeuble au profit d'un autre immeuble. \u00c9videmment, si ce service immobilier n'appara\u00eet pas dans le titre, il n'y a pas de servitude; il n'y a qu'une obligation personnelle. Et j'ajoute que, contrairement \u00e0 ce qui existe en France, et, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 ce qu'enseignent les commentateurs du Code Napol\u00e9on, pour une servitude, la possession m\u00eame imm\u00e9moriale ne suffit pas \u00e0 cet effet (C.C. 549); le titre constitutif de la servitude ne peut \u00eatre remplac\u00e9 que par un acte recognitif \u00e9manant du propri\u00e9taire du fonds asservi (C.C. 550); et m\u00eame la destination du p\u00e8re de famille vaut titre, seulement lorsqu'elle est par \u00e9crit, et que la nature, l'\u00e9tendue et la situation en sont sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9es (C.C. 551).\nIl faut rapprocher de cette derni\u00e8re particularit\u00e9 \"que la nature, l'\u00e9tendue et la situation en sont sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9es', qu'en vertu de l'article 545, \"l'usage et l'\u00e9tendue de ces servitudes se d\u00e9terminent d'apr\u00e8s le titre qui les constitue, ou d'apr\u00e8s les r\u00e8gles qui suivent si le titre ne s'en explique pas\".\nOr, ici, d'apr\u00e8s m\u00eame la clause du testament que nous avons cit\u00e9e et d'apr\u00e8s tout ce que dit le Juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, il n'est pas possible de d\u00e9terminer l'usage et l'\u00e9tendue de la servitude que les deux jugements, qui sont en appel devant nous, ont pr\u00e9tendu imposer au barrage de la retenue; sans compter que l'effet des jugements serait que cette charge qu'ils imposent \u00e0 l'appelant, si elle est une servitude r\u00e9elle,, comme ils le disent, constituerait sur le barrage de la retenue une charge \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9. En sorte que, tous les acqu\u00e9reurs successifs de l'h\u00e9ritage l\u00e9gu\u00e9 par la testatrice \u00e0 Louis Richard seraient tenus ind\u00e9finiment \u00e0 r\u00e9parer le barrage de la retenue pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des d\u00e9tenteurs des moulins \u00e0 scie et \u00e0 farine l\u00e9gu\u00e9s par la testatrice \u00e0 sa fille. C'est une cons\u00e9quence \u00e0 laquelle je ne puis me r\u00e9soudre dans l'interpr\u00e9tation du texte du testament.\nNaturellement, j'ai consid\u00e9r\u00e9 si, ind\u00e9pendamment de ce texte, l'intim\u00e9e n'aurait pas pu invoquer les articles du Code qui parlent des servitudes qui d\u00e9rivent de la situation des lieux. L'article 503 du Code Civil r\u00e8gle le cas de celui dont l'h\u00e9ritage borne une eau courante ne faisant pas partie du domaine public, ou de celui dont l'h\u00e9ritage est travers\u00e9 par cette eau. Il peut s'en servir, \u00e0 son passage, pour l'utilit\u00e9 de son h\u00e9ritage, mais de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ne pas emp\u00eacher l'exercice du m\u00eame droit par ceux \u00e0 qui il appartient, et, c'est-\u00e0-dire, \"\u00e0 la charge de la rendre \u00e0 la sortie du fonds \u00e0 son cours ordinaire\". \u00c9videmment, ce n'est pas l\u00e0 le droit que l'intim\u00e9e invoque; et, en plus, elle ne saurait l'invoquer, parce que cet article traite d'une eau courante qui borne ou traverse un h\u00e9ritage dans son cours naturel. Or, ici, c'est l'intim\u00e9e elle-m\u00eame qui se charge de nous d\u00e9montrer que, sans le barrage de la retenue (et, c'est-\u00e0-dire, sans le secours de cet ouvrage artificiel), le peu d'eau courante qui borne ou traverse l'h\u00e9ritage de l'appelant ne serait d'aucune utilit\u00e9 pour ses moulins \u00e0 scie et \u00e0 farine. Si le barrage de la retenue n'\u00e9tait pas l\u00e0 pour diriger l'eau de la rivi\u00e8re Laval dans la rivi\u00e8re de Lottinville ou Petit-Pr\u00e9, cette derni\u00e8re serait absolument insuffisante pour les besoins des moulins de l'intim\u00e9e.\nOr, Pothier dans son Trait\u00e9 des Donations testamentaires, au chapitre 7, intitul\u00e9: \"De l'interpr\u00e9tation des legs\", pose la r\u00e8gle suivante:\n357. Art. II\u2014Il ne faut pas n\u00e9anmoins s'\u00e9carter de la signification propre des termes du testament s'il n'y a de juste raison de croire que le testateur les a entendus dans un autre sens que leur sens naturel.\nEt nous avons sur ce point la d\u00e9cision du Comit\u00e9 Judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans le cas de Auger v. Beaudry 4:\nThe only safe method of determining what was the real intention of a testator is to give the fair and literal meaning to the actual language of the will.\nAppliquant les principes ainsi pos\u00e9s par ces deux hautes autorit\u00e9s, il s'en suit que nous devons rechercher l'intention de la testatrice en l'esp\u00e8ce exclusivement dans le langage dont elle s'est servie. En cela, d'ailleurs, nous ne ferons que suivre la prescription du Code Civil (art. 1013) que la port\u00e9e d'un document doit toujours se d\u00e9duire du sens litt\u00e9ral des termes employ\u00e9s et qu'on ne doit recourir \u00e0 une autre interpr\u00e9tation que \"lorsque la commune intention des parties est douteuse\".\nA cet article du Code on doit ajouter que, m\u00eame dans le doute, le contrat s'interpr\u00e8te en faveur de celui qui est charg\u00e9 de l'obligation (C.C. 1019).\nD'apr\u00e8s les strictes r\u00e8gles du Code Civil, par cons\u00e9quent, il ne s'agit pas ici de rechercher si l'usage de l'eau provenant du barrage de la retenue peut ou non \u00eatre utile ou m\u00eame n\u00e9cessaire aux moulins de l'intim\u00e9e. C'est la testa- trice qui elle-m\u00eame avait le droit de stipuler quelles seraient les obligations de son fils Louis Richard, et les tribunaux n'ont pas le droit de lui en imposer davantage, au-del\u00e0 de ce qu'elle a elle-m\u00eame d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son testament (Consulter Riou v., Riou 5, C.C. art. 545). Et quand le droit de servitude est douteux en vertu du titre, le doute doit \u00eatre donn\u00e9 en faveur de l'immeuble servant, c'est-\u00e0-dire, en l'esp\u00e8ce, de l'appelant (Cross v. Judah 6), D\u00e9cision de la Cour de Revision 7.\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rons de nouveau au jugement du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans Auger v. Beaudry supra. A la page 1014, il s'exprime comme suit:\nBut whatever wavering from the strict rule of construction may have taken place in the past, it is now recognized that the only safe method of determining what was the real intention of a testator is to give the fair and literal meaning to the actual language of the will. Human motives are too uncertain to render it wise or safe to leave the firm guide of the words used for the uncertain direction of what it must be assumed that a reasonable man would mean.\nC'est ainsi qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans Christin v. P\u00e9loquin 8:\nA covenant in a deed by which P. acquired the right to erect a wind-mill pump on his neighbour's land to supply water to his premises by a pipe, \"that he agrees to permit F., another neighbour, to take water for the use of his premises from the pump, and for that purpose to connect a pipe with the one to be laid by P.\" does not establish a servitude in favour of F.'s premises. The latter are not described so as to be made a dominant tenement and there is no servient tenement on which the charge is imposed. The covenant only gives rise to a personal obligation by P. to F. and the subsequent owners, \u00e0 titre particulier, of F.'s premises have no rights of servitude that can be enforced against P.\nDe m\u00eame, la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) dans Germain v. H\u00e9bert 9 a jug\u00e9 que\nNulle servitude ne pouvant s'\u00e9tablir sans titre, une entente entre certains cultivateurs et le propri\u00e9taire d'une beurrerie, en vertu de laquelle ces derniers, en contribuant quelque peu \u00e0 la construction d'un chemin sur la terre du propri\u00e9taire, auraient obtenu la permission d'y passer pour se rendre \u00e0 la beurrerie, ne constitue pas un titre cr\u00e9ant une servitude de passage, m\u00eame si la municipalit\u00e9 avait contribu\u00e9 une modique somme pour acheter la broche de la cl\u00f4ture de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 du chemin.\nSi maintenant l'on se reporte au langage employ\u00e9 par la testatrice dans son testament (testament fait devant deux notaires et, par cons\u00e9quent, o\u00f9 l'on ne peut all\u00e9guer que la testatrice n'avait pas l'assistance de professionnels vers\u00e9s dans la loi), l'on remarque imm\u00e9diatement que le mot \"servitude\" n'est nulle part employ\u00e9; mais naturellement cela ne serait pas d\u00e9cisif, si par ailleurs les termes du testament justifiaient de croire qu'elle a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une servitude.\nD'autre part, il m'est impossible de trouver dans ces termes une constitution de servitude. Cette affirmation trouvera un appui suppl\u00e9mentaire si l'on tient compte de la situation des lieux.\nLa testatrice poss\u00e9dait une manufacture de carton avec les terres y attenant et les b\u00e2tisses \u00e9rig\u00e9es sur ces terrains et servant \u00e0 l'exploitation de la manufacture. En vertu de la clause 4 du testament, elle donne cette manufacture \u00e0 son fils Louis et elle y ajoute \"la maison autrefois habit\u00e9e par lui avec droit de passage \u00e0 pied et en voiture sur la terre voisine pour avoir issue de sa maison sur le chemin public, avec aussi le garage d'automobile, l'automobile et les terrains attenant \u00e0 la dite maison\".\nElle lui donne en plus \"le wagon automobile (truck) ainsi que toutes les machineries, courroies, et autres garnitures de son moulin des Saules, lequel dit moulin est dispos\u00e9 plus loin dans mon testament\u2026 et le pouvoir d'eau de la retenue et ce qui sert \u00e0 l'exploiter tel que chauss\u00e9es, digues, ainsi que la maison appel\u00e9e power house\". Elle stipule que son fils \"aura droit de passage \u00e0 pied et en voiture sur les terres l\u00e9gu\u00e9es \u00e0 d'autres locataires; pour se rendre au pouvoir d'eau de la retenue, au power house, \u00e0 la mine, au chemin de fer par les chemins existants d\u00e9j\u00e0 et affect\u00e9s \u00e0 cet usage\".\nL'on remarque que d'abord elle parle l\u00e0 de sa manufacture de carton et des b\u00e2tisses et terrains servant \u00e0 l'exploitation de cette manufacture.\nCe n'est que dans un paragraphe subs\u00e9quent qu'elle donne \"le pouvoir d'eau de la retenue'-' avec droit de passage \u00e0 pied et en voiture pour se rendre \u00e0 ce pouvoir d'eau. Mais quand, dans la clause 7 du testament, elle d\u00e9crit le legs fait \u00e0 sa fille Zo\u00e9, elle l'exprime comme suit: \"\u2026 mon moulin \u00e0 scie, mon moulin \u00e0 farine, mon cottage situ\u00e9 pr\u00e8s du moulin au bas de la c\u00f4te, la b\u00e2tisse des ouvriers, et les emplacements sur lesquels ces immeubles sont situ\u00e9s et les terrains attenant aux dits immeubles, ainsi que leurs d\u00e9pendances;\". Puis, elle ajoute: \"Ma fille Zo\u00e9 aura le droit de se faire fournir par mon fils Louis, \u00e0 m\u00eame le pouvoir d'eau de la manufacture, l'eau n\u00e9cessaire pour faire fonctionner les moulins que je lui l\u00e8gue pr\u00e9sentement; mais si des r\u00e9parations devenaient n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la manufacture de carton, ou au pouvoir d'eau lui-m\u00eame et qu'il fut n\u00e9cessaire de suspendre le service de l'eau, alors, ma dite fille Zo\u00e9 devra souffrir cette suspension du service de l'eau sans pr\u00e9tendre aucun recours en dommages contre mon dit fils Louis;\".\nElle fait donc une distinction tr\u00e8s nette entre le pouvoir d'eau de la manufacture et le pouvoir d'eau de la retenue. Dans le legs constitu\u00e9 par la clause 4 du testament elle parle d'abord de la \"manufacture de carton\"; puis, dans un paragraphe distinct, elle parle du \"pouvoir d'eau de la retenue\". Dans la clause 7, qui est celle qui concerne sa fille Zo\u00e9, lorsqu'elle lui l\u00e8gue le droit de se faire fournir par son fils Louis l'eau n\u00e9cessaire pour faire fonctionner les moulins qu'elle lui l\u00e8gue, elle stipule que cette eau devra \u00eatre prise \"\u00e0 m\u00eame le pouvoir d'eau de la manufacture\".\nOr, il est de r\u00e8gle que les m\u00eames mots employ\u00e9s dans un m\u00eame document doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s comme signifiant la m\u00eame chose. Appliquant cette r\u00e8gle, il s'ensuit que le pouvoir d'eau de la manufacture, auquel r\u00e9f\u00e8re la clause 7, est le pouvoir d'eau de la manufacture de carton mentionn\u00e9 dans la clause 4.\nEn plus, il n'y a pas de manufacture \"au pouvoir d'eau de la retenue\". Comment, d\u00e8s lors, interpr\u00e9ter les mots de la clause 7, \"\u00e0 m\u00eame le pouvoir d'eau de la manufacture\", comme s'appliquant au pouvoir d'eau de la retenue?\nIl est clairement \u00e9tabli dans la preuve que \"le pouvoir d'eau de la retenue\" \u00e9tait la fa\u00e7on reconnue de d\u00e9signer un autre pouvoir d'eau, qui n'\u00e9tait pas celui de la manufacture de carton, et qui d'ailleurs est situ\u00e9 \u00e0 quatre milles de distance de la manufacture. Il se peut que l'on e\u00fbt pu entendre que la manufacture de carton b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait r\u00e9ellement de deux pouvoirs d'eau, celui de la retenue et celui constitu\u00e9 par le barrage qui se trouve \u00e0 la manufacture; mais lorsque la testatrice prend la peine de d\u00e9signer chacun de ces pouvoirs d'eau d'une fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente, le langage qu'elle emploie oblige de donner \u00e0 chacun d'eux un sens diff\u00e9rent.\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 le fait que le pouvoir d'eau de la retenue est \u00e0 quatre milles de distance de la manufacture rend vraiment improbable que si la testatrice avait voulu dans la clause 7 d\u00e9signer la retenue comme \u00e9tant le pouvoir d'eau d'o\u00f9 sa fille Zo\u00e9 aurait le droit de se faire fournir l'eau n\u00e9cessaire pour faire fonctionner les moulins qu'elle lui l\u00e9guait, elle n'aurait pas employ\u00e9 pour le d\u00e9signer les m\u00eames mots qu'elle a employ\u00e9s dans la clause 4.\nPersonnellement je n'ai pas de doute sur le sens de ces mots; mais, comme on l'a vu tant d'apr\u00e8s le Code Civil que d'apr\u00e8s la jurisprudence, s'il y a un doute, il doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 en faveur de celui \u00e0 qui l'obligation \u00e9tait impos\u00e9e et \u00e0 l'encontre de celui qui voudrait en b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier.\nDe plus, la clause 7 elle-m\u00eame fournit une indication additionnelle du v\u00e9ritable sens que l'on doit donner \u00e0 l'expression: \"\u00e0 m\u00eame le pouvoir d'eau de la manufacture\"; car cette clause ajoute que si des r\u00e9parations devenaient n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la manufacture de carton, ou au pouvoir d'eau lui-m\u00eame et qu'il f\u00fbt n\u00e9cessaire de suspendre le service de l'eau, alors, la fille de la testatrice devra souffrir cette suspension de service de l'eau sans pr\u00e9tendre aucun recours en dommages contre son dit fils Louis. Il ne semble pas qu'il puisse y avoir le moindre doute que la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \"au pouvoir d'eau lui-m\u00eame\" venant imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s l'emploi des mots \"manufacture de carton\" ait pour but de d\u00e9signer le pouvoir d'eau de la manufacture, celui-l\u00e0 m\u00eame d'o\u00f9 la fille de la testatrice a le droit de se faire fournir par son fr\u00e8re Louis l'eau n\u00e9cessaire pour faire fonctionner les moulins que la testatrice lui a l\u00e9gu\u00e9s.\nJ'ajoute cette analyse seulement \u00e0 titre suppl\u00e9mentaire car, \u00e0 mon humble avis, l'expression de la testatrice: \"Ma fille Zo\u00e9 aura le droit de se faire fournir par mon fils Louis, \u00e0 m\u00eame le pouvoir d'eau de la manufacture, l'eau n\u00e9cessaire\u2026\" n'a pas pour effet de cr\u00e9er une servitude. Cette expression constitue exclusivement la cr\u00e9ation d'une obli- gation personnelle de la part de Louis. Il en r\u00e9sulte qu'il lui incombe de fournir l'eau \u00e0 sa s\u0153ur Zo\u00e9 avec la restriction que cette eau devra provenir du \"pouvoir d'eau de la manufacture\". C'est l\u00e0 le sens litt\u00e9ral des mots employ\u00e9s. L'intention n'est pas douteuse; et l'article 1013 du Code Civil doit recevoir sa stricte application. Cette intention d\u00e9coule davantage encore, si possible, du fait que la clause ajoute que la fille devra souffrir toute suspension de service au cas o\u00f9 des r\u00e9parations deviendraient n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la manufacture de carton ou au pouvoir d'eau de cette manufacture.\nComme je l'ai dit, c'est dans les notes de l'honorable juge Saint-Jacques qu'il faut trouver les motifs de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'Appel, car les autres juges d\u00e9clarent partager enti\u00e8rement son opinion. La premi\u00e8re observation qui, d'apr\u00e8s moi, s'impose \u00e0 ce sujet, c'est que l'honorable juge s'appuie sur des textes des commentateurs du Code Napol\u00e9on: Toullier & Duvergier; Pardessus; Planiol & Ripert et Puzier-Herman.\nOr, le Code Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, en mati\u00e8res de servitudes, est diff\u00e9rent du Code fran\u00e7ais. Ce sont les codificateurs eux-m\u00eames qui nous en pr\u00e9viennent; et, d'ailleurs, il suffit de comparer les articles des deux codes pour le constater imm\u00e9diatement.\nIl y a tout d'abord une diff\u00e9rence fondamentale: C'est, qu'en vertu du Code civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec (art. 549), nulle servitude ne peut s'\u00e9tablir sans titre et que la possession, m\u00eame imm\u00e9moriale, ne suffit pas \u00e0 cet effet. Sur ce point, le 3e Rapport des codificateurs nous dit :\nCet article qui n'est qu'une r\u00e9p\u00e9tition du 186e de la Coutume de Paris, \u00e9nonce que la servitude ne peut s'acqu\u00e9rir par prescription, que dans tous les cas il faut un titre (54); il remplace les articles 690 et 691 du Code Napol\u00e9on, le premier d\u00e9cidant que les servitudes continues et apparentes s'acqui\u00e8rent par titre et par prescription de trente ans, et le second d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant que les continues non apparentes et les discontinues apparentes ou non apparentes ne peuvent s'\u00e9tablir que par titre, adoptant en cela le syst\u00e8me du droit romain contraire \u00e0 celui g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement admis en France dans les pays de coutume, o\u00f9 l'on suivait la maxime de la Coutume de Paris, \"nulle servitude sans titre\".\nDe m\u00eame de l'article 545 du Code Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, en vertu duquel: \"L'usage et l'\u00e9tendue de ces servitudes se d\u00e9terminent d'apr\u00e8s le titre qui les constitue, ou d'apr\u00e8s les r\u00e8gles qui suivent, si -le titre ne s'en explique pas\". Voici, dans le 3e Rapport, ce qu'en disent les codificateurs:\nCet article indique, dans un premier paragraphe, quels sont ceux qui peuvent \u00e9tablir des servitudes sur ou en faveur de leurs fonds, et dans un second, comment s'appr\u00e9cient et se d\u00e9terminent l'usage et l'\u00e9tendue de celles une fois \u00e9tablies; il remplace l'article 686 du Code Napol\u00e9on (50) dont il diff\u00e8re cependant d'abord, en ce que dans le premier paragraphe ' il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9: \"que les services \u00e9tablis ne sont impos\u00e9s ni \u00e0 la personne ni en faveur de la personne, mais au fonds et pour le fonds\"; \u00e9nonciation inutile pour nous, et qui a d\u00fb \u00eatre omise, apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9claration d\u00e9j\u00e0 faite qu'il ne s'agit ici que des servitudes r\u00e9elles et nullement des personnelles; et ensuite en ce qu'il a fallu changer la r\u00e9daction de ce m\u00eame paragraphe pour lui faire dire d'une mani\u00e8re distincte que la seule qualit\u00e9 de propri\u00e9taire d'un immeuble ne suffit pas pour permettre de le grever ou de le faire jouir d'une servitude, mais qu'il faut de plus \u00eatre usant de ses droits et capable d'ali\u00e9ner, puisque l'imposition d'une servitude diminuant la valeur de l'immeuble en est justement regard\u00e9e comme une ali\u00e9nation partielle.\nLe second paragraphe de l'article 686 a aussi d\u00fb \u00eatre chang\u00e9 pour le rendre conforme \u00e0 notre syst\u00e8me, qui n'admet pas de servitudes sans titre. Malgr\u00e9 cela il est possible que le titre qui la constitue ne s'explique pas sur l'usage et l'\u00e9tendue du droit; alors il faut avoir recours \u00e0 certaines r\u00e8gles qui se trouvent trac\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente section; c'est ce que dit le second paragraphe de notre article tel qu'il est propos\u00e9.\nA l'\u00e9gard d'autres articles encore du Code Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, les codificateurs indiquent que les articles qu'ils ont propos\u00e9s (et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9s) sont bas\u00e9s sur la Coutume de Paris et ne sont pas conformes au Code Napol\u00e9on. Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de les \u00e9num\u00e9rer ici, vu que les articles en question ne trouvent pas d'application dans la pr\u00e9sente cause.\nMais ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de est suffisant pour d\u00e9montrer le danger d'accepter, pour interpr\u00e9ter la Loi de Qu\u00e9bec, les commentaires des auteurs qui ont \u00e9crit sous le Code Napol\u00e9on.\nMais, en outre de cette critique qu'il faut n\u00e9cessairement adresser aux notes de M. le juge Saint-Jacques, il y a surtout que les extraits des commentateurs qu'il cite\u2014je le dis en toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence\u2014ne sont pas applicables au pr\u00e9sent litige.\nLes citations de Toullier-Duvergier (6e \u00e9dition, Tome 2, n\u00b0 588, p. 264) et de Pardessus (Trait\u00e9 des Servitudes\u2014Tome 1, n\u00b0 10, p. 25) traitent de la question du point de vue du fonds dominant tandis que la pr\u00e9sente cause doit \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e du point de vue du fonds servant. La cita- tion de Toullier parle du droit impos\u00e9 pour un fonds, ou stipul\u00e9 en faveur de la personne; celle de Pardessus fait de m\u00eame: \"\u2026la concession soit express\u00e9ment d\u00e9clar\u00e9e \u00eatre faite \u00e0 ce fonds ou \u00e0 une personne qui dans le fait poss\u00e8de cet h\u00e9ritage et qui aurait qualit\u00e9 pour acqu\u00e9rir des droits en sa faveur\u2026\".\nOr, ici, ce que nous avons \u00e0 rechercher est si une servitude r\u00e9elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \"\u00e9tablie sur\" l'immeuble de Louis Richard, et cette recherche doit \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e d'apr\u00e8s le titre qui, suivant qu'on le pr\u00e9tend, aurait ici constitu\u00e9 une servitude, et, c'est \u00e0 savoir, le testament.\nLes mots du testament ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduits plusieurs fois dans ce jugement, mais on ne saurait jamais trop y insister. C'est le droit conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la fille Zo\u00e9 \"de se faire fournir par le fils Louis, \u00e0 m\u00eame le pouvoir d'eau de la manufacture, l'eau n\u00e9cessaire\u2026\".\nIl me para\u00eet impossible d'\u00e9tendre le sens de cette expression de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 lui faire dire que les moulins l\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e0 la fille Zo\u00e9 auront le droit de se faire fournir de l'eau. Le sens litt\u00e9ral et naturel de cette expression est que la testatrice conf\u00e9ra un droit \u00e0 la fille Zo\u00e9 elle-m\u00eame qui, seule, peut contraindre son fr\u00e8re \u00e0 lui fournir de l'eau.\nMais, surtout, \"se faire fournir l'eau n\u00e9cessaire\" par le fils Louis ne saurait impliquer autre chose qu'un acte par Louis de fournir l'eau en question. Il ne s'agit pas ici d'une obligation \u00e9tablie sur l'immeuble de Louis; il s'agit d'une obligation que le fils Louis devra \u00eatre tenu de remplir par son acte personnel. Ce n'est pas une charge impos\u00e9e sur le fonds l\u00e9gu\u00e9 \u00e0 Louis; c'est une dette impos\u00e9e \u00e0 Louis personnellement. Pardessus lui-m\u00eame, dans son Trait\u00e9 des Servitudes (8e \u00e9dition, Tome 1, p. 25), fait remarquer que:\nLa distinction entre les droits personnels et les droits r\u00e9els, quoique pouvant les uns et les autres \u00eatre exerc\u00e9s sur des immeubles, n'est pas seulement dans les mots; elle a des effets importants pour le mode d'acquisition, de conservation et d'extinction des droits.\nCette phrase, que je tire de Pardessus, pr\u00e9c\u00e8de imm\u00e9diatement le passage cit\u00e9 par l'honorable juge Saint-Jacques. Et, au n\u00b0 11, qui suit presque imm\u00e9diatement, le m\u00eame auteur ajoute:\nLes servitudes consistent, soit dans l'obligation du propri\u00e9taire d'un fonds de souffrir qu'on y exerce un droit, soit dans l'obligation de ce propri\u00e9taire de s'abstenir de quelque chose qu'il aurait naturellement droit d'y faire. Entre autres exemples de cette obligation de souffrir qu'on y exerce un droit, il mentionne: \"d'aller y puiser, ou d'y conduire ses bestiaux \u00e0 l'abreuvage, au pacage, etc.\"\nL'auteur donne plusieurs autres exemples, qui, tous, impliquent la stipulation que le propri\u00e9taire du fonds dominant aurait la facult\u00e9 d'accomplir un acte positif sur le fonds servant. Il parle (p. 29) du \"droit de prendre dans une for\u00eat les bois n\u00e9cessaires au chauffage\". A la page 49, il dit, en parlant de l'article 686 du Code Napol\u00e9on:\nCet article \"ne permettant pas de stipuler des servitudes impos\u00e9es \u00e0 la personne, on ne pourrait en donner le nom et en attribuer les effets \u00e0 des travaux ou journ\u00e9es d'hommes ou d'animaux, que le donateur ou le vendeur d'un immeuble imposerait \u00e0 l'acqu\u00e9reur, quand m\u00eame ces prestations auraient pour objet de procurer une plus grande utilit\u00e9 \u00e0 un h\u00e9ritage en faveur duquel elles auroient \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9es ou r\u00e9serv\u00e9es. Peu importeroit que les contractants eussent d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la charge sera fonci\u00e8re et perp\u00e9tuelle sur tel ou tel h\u00e9ritage; parce que la libert\u00e9 des conventions ne va pas jusqu'\u00e0 modifier ce qui est de l'essence des choses. On ne pourrait y voir qu'un louage de services; si la dur\u00e9e n'en avoit pas \u00e9t\u00e9 limit\u00e9e par la convention des parties, elle devroit l'\u00eatre par les tribunaux; elle n'obligeroit que celui qui auroit promis et ses h\u00e9ritiers, dans les cas o\u00f9, d'apr\u00e8s les principes du droit commun, ceux-ci sont tenus d'ex\u00e9cuter une obligation de faire, contract\u00e9e par leurs auteurs. Celui qui, par la suite, deviendroit acqu\u00e9reur du fonds, dans la vente duquel cette convention accessoire auroit \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9e, n'en seroit tenu que si une clause sp\u00e9ciale de sa propre acquisition l'en chargeoit, \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence d'une servitude, dont il seroit tenu de plein droit et sans stipulation expresse.\nEt, \u00e0 la page 38, il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit:\nSi le doute \u00e9toit absolu, si aucune des circonstances, dont l'appr\u00e9ciation leur appartient (aux tribunaux), ne pouvoit le lever, il seroit plus s\u00fbr de d\u00e9cider que la stipulation est personnelle, plut\u00f4t que de la qualifier servitude; d'abord parce qu'en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral une clause obscure doit \u00eatre expliqu\u00e9e contre le stipulant et en faveur de l'oblig\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'art. 1162 du code; en second lieu parce que la cause de la libert\u00e9 est la plus favorable, et qu'une concession en faveur des personnes, pr\u00e9sente une chance de dur\u00e9e moins longue et par cons\u00e9quent une charge moindre qu'une concession \u00e0 titre de servitude.\nEt M. Planiol, dans son Trait\u00e9 \u00e9lmentaire de Droit Civil (6e \u00e9dition, Tome 1, n\u00b0 2929, p. 919) expose bien, il me semble, le caract\u00e8re d'une servitude. Il intitule son paragraphe: \"Le service ne doit pas \u00eatre impos\u00e9 \u00e0 la personne\", et, au cours de son explication de cette proposition, il dit:\nLe propri\u00e9taire du fonds dominant acquiert un droit r\u00e9el, ayant pour objet l'utilisation par lui du fonds d'autrui et le propri\u00e9taire du fonds servant est seulement tenu de l'en laisser jouir, sans avoir rien fait dans ce but. Ce n'est pas moi qui souligne les mots \"par lui\"; c'est l'auteur lui-m\u00eame et c'est ce qui l'am\u00e8ne un peu plus loin \u00e0 parler de la \"nature purement passive des servitudes\". En d'autres termes, le propri\u00e9taire du fonds servant n'a rien \u00e0 faire dans le but de permettre l'exercice de la servitude, car cette servitude, suivant l'expression de l'auteur, a \"pour objet l'utilisation par lui du fonds d'autrui\". C'est le propri\u00e9taire du fonds dominant qui doit utiliser par lui-m\u00eame et non pas forcer le propri\u00e9taire du fonds servant \u00e0 accomplir en faveur du propri\u00e9taire du fonds dominant un acte positif.\nPuis, quand le m\u00eame auteur est amen\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9tudier les cons\u00e9quences de cette situation, au n\u00b0 2930 il dit:\nActuellement, une personne peut bien prendre l'engagement de rendre \u00e0 un propri\u00e9taire certains services, mais cela sous une double restriction: 1o Il ne r\u00e9sultera de sa promesse qu'une obligation qui lui sera personnelle, non une servitude; cette obligation ne passera pas apr\u00e8s elle aux propri\u00e9taires successifs de son bien; elle-m\u00eame en sera personnellement d\u00e9bitrice et ne sera pas tenue \u00e0 raison de son fonds et en qualit\u00e9 de propri\u00e9taire.\nPlus loin, au n\u00b0 2935, Planiol dit, en comparant les servitudes avec les droits d'usage et les obligations:\nCette obligation peut avoir pour objet une prestation positive, une fourniture ou un travail \u00e0 faire par le promettant.\net\nUne fois cr\u00e9\u00e9e elle est transmissible aux h\u00e9ritiers de l'une ou de l'autre partie; le droit de cr\u00e9ance passe aux h\u00e9ritiers du cr\u00e9ancier, la dette aux h\u00e9ritiers du d\u00e9biteur. Mais les acqu\u00e9reurs \u00e0 titre particulier du fonds sur lequel s'ex\u00e9cute la charge n'en sont pas tenus, \u00e0 moins qu'ils ne s'y soient sp\u00e9cialement oblig\u00e9s.\nEt l\u00e0 encore, ce n'est pas moi, mais l'auteur, qui souligne les mots \"prestation positive\".\nVoil\u00e0 donc, en r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 quelques auteurs, ce que l'on entend, m\u00eame en France, en vertu du Code Napol\u00e9on.\nD'autre part, si l'on se r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 Pothier (\u00c9dition Bugnet, Tome 1, p. 312), voici comment cet auteur qui, \u00e9videmment, n'\u00e9crivait pas sous le Code Napol\u00e9on, d\u00e9finit les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux sur la nature des servitudes r\u00e9elles:\n1. Le droit de servitude est le droit de se servir de la chose d'autrui \u00e0 quelque usage, ou d'en interdire quelque usage au propri\u00e9taire ou possesseur. La servitude, de la part de celui qui la doit, ne consiste donc \u00e0 autre chose qu'\u00e0 souffrir que celui \u00e0 qui elle est due, se serve de la chose pour l'usage pour lequel il a droit de s'en servir, ou \u00e0 s'abstenir de ce que celui \u00e0 qui elle est due a droit d'emp\u00eacher qu'on y fasse. Au reste, les droits de servitude n'obligent point le possesseur de l'h\u00e9ritage qui la doit, \u00e0 faire quelque chose ou \u00e0 donner quelque chose: en quoi ces droits diff\u00e8rent des droits de redevance fonci\u00e8re et des droits de corv\u00e9e.\nLes diff\u00e9rentes r\u00e9f\u00e9rences que je viens de faire indiquent donc ce qui, \u00e0 mon humble avis, constitue les caract\u00e9ristiques de la servitude r\u00e9elle. De la part du fonds servant, elle doit \u00eatre exclusivement passive et ne pas exiger de son propri\u00e9taire une participation active. D\u00e8s qu'elle l'exige, ce n'est plus une servitude r\u00e9elle impos\u00e9e comme charge sur le fonds dont il est propri\u00e9taire, c'est une obligation personnelle.\nUn arr\u00eat de notre Cour, qui nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e, Riverain & B\u00e9langer v. Price Brothers Limit\u00e9e 10 est un exemple de la diff\u00e9rence qu'il faut faire entre une obligation personnelle et une servitude r\u00e9elle. Dans ce cas, par le titre constitutif, le vendeur c\u00e9dait \u00e0 l'acqu\u00e9reur le droit de jouir \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 du terrain occup\u00e9 par les dalles d'un certain moulin \u00e0 farine, \"avec le droit de prendre l'eau n\u00e9cessaire pour faire mouvoir ledit moulin\u2026 \". Cette d\u00e9signation du droit du propri\u00e9taire du fonds dominant souligne la distinction entre le droit actif de son propri\u00e9taire (\"droit de prendre\"), qui constitue une servitude en faveur du fonds dominant, et l'obligation passive du propri\u00e9taire du fonds servant qui doit simplement laisser prendre d'une part; et, d'autre part, la d\u00e9signation que l'on trouve dans le testament de Madame Richard, qui ne conf\u00e8re pas \u00e0 la fille Zo\u00e9 le \"droit de prendre\" mais simplement \"le droit de se faire fournir\" \u2026ce qui ne conf\u00e8re \u00e0 la fille Zo\u00e9 aucun droit d'aller prendre l'eau, mais simplement la cr\u00e9ance, en sa faveur, qui consiste \u00e0 \"se faire fournir\" l'eau par son fr\u00e8re Louis.\nC'est d'ailleurs ainsi que l'exposent nos auteurs canadiens. Mignault, dans son \"Droit civil canadien\" (Tome 3, p. 4) dit\nQuant \u00e0 la servitude elle peut bien conf\u00e9rer au propri\u00e9taire du fonda dominant le droit de faire sur le fonds servant certains actes de ma\u00eetre, comme, par exemple, le droit d'y passer pour l'exploitation de son fonds, ou imposer au propri\u00e9taire du fonds servant, l'obligation de n'y pas faire certains actes qui pourraient nuire au propri\u00e9taire voisin, comme, par exemple, l'obligation de ne pas hausser sa maison, afin de ne pas nuire aux vues d'une autre maison; mais, jamais elle ne consiste \u00e0 faire quelque chose. Elle n'est due, en effet, que par l'h\u00e9ritage sur lequel elle est \u00e9tablie, et ce n'est qu'indirectement qu'en souffre le propri\u00e9taire; or, si une personne peut \u00eatre oblig\u00e9e \u00e0 faire quelque chose, on con\u00e7oit qu'il n'en saurait \u00eatre de m\u00eame d'un h\u00e9ritage. La servitude ne consiste donc, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, qu'\u00e0 souffrir ou \u00e0 ne pas faire. Le propri\u00e9taire auquel elle appartient doit, s'il veut en jouir et la conserver, faire \u00e0 ses frais tous les travaux qui sont n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 ce double effet; il ne peut rien exiger du propri\u00e9taire du fonds servant, si ce n'est qu'il s'abstienne de tous actes qui pourraient entraver l'exercice de son droit.\nD'autre part, Langelier, dans son \"Cours de droit civil\" (Tome 2, p. 248), \u00e9crit dans le m\u00eame sens:\nUn deuxi\u00e8me caract\u00e8re de la servitude, qui d\u00e9coule du premier, c'est qu'elle ne doit pas consister dans une obligation personnelle du propri\u00e9taire du fonds servant, parce qu'autrement le propri\u00e9taire du fonds servant deviendrait une esp\u00e8ce de serf du propri\u00e9taire du fonds dominant. Il serait oblig\u00e9 envers celui-ci par le fait seul qu'il serait le propri\u00e9taire du fonds servant, ce qui serait contraire \u00e0 notre droit, o\u00f9 le servage est inconnu.\nIl r\u00e9sulte de l\u00e0 que, pour qu'il puisse exister une servitude, il faut qu'il y ait un \u00e9tat de choses tel que la servitude puisse \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e sans aucun travail personnel du propri\u00e9taire du fonds servant.\nIl en r\u00e9sulte que 'le droit de se faire fournir l'eau\", qui implique un acte positif de la part de celui qui doit la fournir, n'est rien autre chose qu'une obligation personnelle, en d'autres termes, qu'une obligation de faire\u2014cette obligation dont traite l'article 1065 du Code civil, qui ne donne pas au cr\u00e9ancier un droit r\u00e9el, ou une servitude r\u00e9elle sur l'immeuble, et qui n'est pas susceptible de faire l'objet d'une action confessoire; mais qui donne uniquement un droit de cr\u00e9ance contre le d\u00e9biteur de l'obligation et qui le rend passible de dommages, au cas de contravention de sa part; et on en trouve l'application dans les conclusions m\u00eames de la pr\u00e9sente action puisque l'intim\u00e9e, apr\u00e8s avoir demand\u00e9 que la Cour reconnaisse l'existence de cette obligation personnelle, demande, qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9faut de son ex\u00e9cution par le d\u00e9biteur, elle soit autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 la faire ex\u00e9cuter aux d\u00e9pens de son d\u00e9biteur, sans pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 son recours pour les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats dans tous les cas.\nEt puis, ind\u00e9pendamment du sens de la clause, elle serait quand m\u00eame insuffisante pour cr\u00e9er une servitude conform\u00e9ment aux exigences de l'article 545 du Code Civil. En vertu de cet article, tout titre constitutif de servitude r\u00e9elle doit d\u00e9terminer \"l'usage et l'\u00e9tendue\" de la servitude. Il serait bien difficile, d'apr\u00e8s la clause en question, de d\u00e9ter- miner ici quels seraient l'usage et l'\u00e9tendue de la servitude qu'on invoquerait en faveur de la fille Zo\u00e9. Il n'y est question que du pouvoir d'eau de la manufacture et de la manufacture de carton elle-m\u00eame. Ce n'est qu'\u00e0 cet \u00e9gard que la clause stipule que des r\u00e9parations devenant n\u00e9cessaires, la fille Zo\u00e9 devra souffrir la suspension de service qui en r\u00e9sultera. Il n'est nullement question dans cette clause du \"pouvoir d'eau de la retenue\", qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9gu\u00e9 au fils Louis par la clause 4 du testament et qui, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, est situ\u00e9 \u00e0 quatre milles de distance du pouvoir d'eau de la manufacture de carton.\nQuelle serait donc \"l'\u00e9tendue de la servitude\" \u00e0 laquelle pr\u00e9tend l'intim\u00e9e? Est-ce qu'elle couvrirait non seulement les terrains attenant \u00e0 la manufacture de carton et les b\u00e2tisses \u00e9rig\u00e9es sur ces terrains et servant \u00e0 l'exploitation de la manufacture, mais \u00e9galement les quatre milles de rivi\u00e8re ou de cours d'eau qui s'\u00e9tendraient depuis la manufacture de carton jusqu'au pouvoir d'eau de la retenue et le pouvoir d'eau de la retenue lui-m\u00eame? Mais l'on ne trouve dans le testament aucune description l\u00e9gale de ce pr\u00e9tendu fonds servant. D'apr\u00e8s l'article 2166 du Code Civil, un plan et un livre de renvoi officiels doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 chaque bureau d'enregistrement indiquant distinctement tous les lots de terre compris dans la circonscription du bureau; et, en vertu de l'article 2168, apr\u00e8s que copie des plan et livre de renvoi a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e ainsi, le num\u00e9ro donn\u00e9 \u00e0 chaque lot sur ce plan et dans ce livre de renvoi est la vraie description de ce lot. D'apr\u00e8s l'article 2172, dans les deux ans qui suivent la date fix\u00e9e par la proclamation du lieutenant-gouverneur, pour la mise en vigueur des dispositions du Code relatives \u00e0 ce plan et \u00e0 ce livre de renvoi, tout droit r\u00e9el sur un lot de terre compris dans cette division doit \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9 par l'enregistrement d'un avis d\u00e9signant l'immeuble affect\u00e9 par le num\u00e9ro qui lui est donn\u00e9 sur le plan et dans le livre de renvoi.\nIci, encore, je me reporterais \u00e0 Pardessus (Trait\u00e9 des servitudes\u2014Tome 1, p. 529)\nToute servitude \u00e9tablie par convention doit \u00eatre \u00e9nonc\u00e9e et d\u00e9sign\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ne laisser aucun doute sur le domaine au profit duquel elle est \u00e9tablie, sur celui qui en est grev\u00e9, et sur l'esp\u00e8ce ou au moins le genre de service qui doit avoir lieu. L'incertitude absolue sur l'un de ces points an\u00e9antiroit la stipulation, par l'impossibilit\u00e9 de conna\u00eetre la v\u00e9ritable intention des parties.\nDans le testament qui nous occupe il n'y a aucune d\u00e9signation officielle et l\u00e9gale des immeubles sur lesquels porterait la pr\u00e9tendue servitude.\nNaturellement, je n'oublie pas que c'est l\u00e0 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment une pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant que si, toutefois, une servitude a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e par le testament, elle n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e, tel que requis par la loi. Il eut fallu \u00e9videmment discuter ce point sur lequel s'appuie l'appelant si, par ailleurs, je n'\u00e9tais pas venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il n'y a pas de servitude en vertu du testament et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire d'examiner la question d'enregistrement pour arriver \u00e0 une conclusion de l'appel.\nMais l'absence de toute d\u00e9signation l\u00e9gale de ce que l'intim\u00e9e voudrait consid\u00e9rer comme un fonds servant est suffisante en soi pour emp\u00eacher qu'aucune servitude ait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment aux exigences des articles 499, 545 et 549 du Code Civil. Le testament, l'unique titre constitutif qu'on invoque, ne contient pas les d\u00e9signations essentielles pour cr\u00e9er une servitude, m\u00eame si l'on pouvait trouver dans le langage employ\u00e9 par la testatrice un sens suffisant pour en d\u00e9duire qu'elle a eu l'intention d'imposer cette servitude sur les immeubles qu'elle l\u00e9guait \u00e0 son fils Louis.\nBien d'autres questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es au cours de l'argumentation de cette cause devant nous. On a pr\u00e9tendu, par exemple, que le barrage de la retenue lui-m\u00eame n'\u00e9tait en soi qu'une servitude, puisque le propri\u00e9taire de la manufacture de carton n'\u00e9tait pas le propri\u00e9taire du fonds immobilier sur lequel le barrage a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9rig\u00e9. D'o\u00f9 il faudrait conclure, en vertu de la loi, qu'aucune servitude ne pourrait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e sur le barrage, puisque la r\u00e8gle de droit est bien connue qu'il ne peut y avoir servitude sur servitude.\nIci, je le dis en tout respect, l'intim\u00e9e me para\u00eet avoir confondu la servitude avec le droit de cr\u00e9ance. Les termes employ\u00e9s par la testatrice ont conf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Zo\u00e9 simplement le droit de se faire fournir l'eau par son fr\u00e8re et ce, seulement \"\u00e0 m\u00eame le pouvoir d'eau de la manufacture\". La fille Zo\u00e9 a h\u00e9rit\u00e9 d'un droit de cr\u00e9ance de ce genre contre son fr\u00e8re et ce dernier ne s'est vu imposer qu'une obligation personnelle d'acquitter cette cr\u00e9ance.\nJe ne m'arr\u00eate donc pas aux autres moyens soulev\u00e9s par l'appelant; et je ne dois pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme me pronon\u00e7ant sur aucun autre que ceux sur lesquels je m'appuie pour arriver \u00e0 d\u00e9cider que l'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu. Mon avis est que le texte du testament ne permet pas de conclure \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation d'une servitude r\u00e9elle sur les immeubles l\u00e9gu\u00e9s par sa m\u00e8re \u00e0 Louis Richard et qui sont actuellement la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant. En plus, je ne crois pas que, m\u00eame si d'apr\u00e8s les termes du testament l'on pourrait arriver \u00e0 penser que la testatrice a voulu cr\u00e9er une servitude, elle l'aurait fait suivant les exigences du Code Civil, et en particulier en ce qui concerne le pouvoir d'eau de la retenue. Il en r\u00e9sulte que l'intim\u00e9e n'a pu acqu\u00e9rir les droits qu'elle tente actuellement d'exercer contre l'appelant, et, suivant moi, elle doit \u00eatre d\u00e9bout\u00e9e de son action.\nL'appel devrait donc \u00eatre maintenu avec les d\u00e9pens dans toutes les Cours.\nRand, J. :\u2014This appeal raises the question of an obligation to repair on the owner of land and water power, including in the latter expression, retaining works, embankments, dams, etc., for the benefit of lands downstream. Each party traces title to a common owner of all the lands and the water power. The lands consisted of parcels on both sides of a stream called the Lottinville River which flows south-easterly into the St. Lawrence, and has its source a short distance south of a similar water course called the Laval River which flows south-westerly into the Montmorency River. At a point a short distance north of the head of the Lottinville, the Laval widens into a small basin and at its westerly end where the river resumes its ordinary width there was erected over 250 years ago a dam which held the waters of the Laval and by means of a short canal, diverted them into the Lottinville. Near the mouth of the latter there were erected many years ago a flour mill on one bank and a sawmill on the other and about a quarter of a mile upstream in 1897 a cardboard factory was built. The factory and the mills each had a dam furnishing the head of water for power. The upper retaining work which with the small basin is called the \"retenue\" was about four miles from the flour mill, and the evidence shows that the retenue, the canal, the right to carry the water over the river-bed and the dams, became vested in the holder of the common root title about 1902.\nIn 1925 that owner died, and by her will she left the cardboard factory, the dam serving it and the entire water power up to and including the retenue to her son; and the adjoining lower lands, including the flour mill and the sawmill and a right to water power sufficient to operate them, to her daughter. The property of the son was purchased by the appellant from the trustee in bankruptcy of the son, and the respondent is the successor in title of the daughter.\nThe clauses of the will on which the dispute hinges are the provision to the son in these words:\u2014\nJe donne et l\u00e8gue avec dispense de rapport \u00e0 mon fils Louis ma manufacture de carton situ\u00e9e \u00e0 l'Ange-Gardien, avec les terrains y attenant et les b\u00e2tisses \u00e9rig\u00e9es sur lesdits terrains et servant \u00e0 l'exploitation de ladite manufacture; je lui donne et l\u00e8gue aussi avec dispense de rapport la maison, autrefois habit\u00e9e par lui avec droit de passage \u00e0 pied et en voiture sur la terre voisine pour avoir issue de sa maison sur le chemin public, avec aussi le garage d'automobile, l'automobile, et les terrains attenant \u00e0 ladite maison; je lui donne et l\u00e8gue toujours avec dispense de rapport le wagon automobile \"truck\", ainsi que toutes les machineries, courroies, et autres garnitures de mon moulin des Saules, lequel dit moulin est dispos\u00e9 plus loin dans mon pr\u00e9sent testament; je lui donne et l\u00e8gue avec dispense de rapport le pouvoir d'eau de la retenue et ce qui sert \u00e0 l'exploiter tel que chauss\u00e9es, digues, ainsi que la maison appel\u00e9e power house.

The factory was burned in 1944, and the interest of the appellant in the power for that purpose has so far disappeared; and the case turns on the question whether he can be called upon to keep in repair the works necessary to the water power of which he may enjoy no use.\nThe appellant urges two grounds on which the judgment below is said to be unsound; first, that the right to receive the water power given to the daughter was a personal right only against the son and cannot be asserted against the appellant; and secondly, that as the will was not registered in the district in which the retenue lies, it cannot be asserted against him in this proceeding. As a subordinate point, Mr. Cannon contends that the right claimed against the appellant involves active performance on his part and is, therefore, beyond the area of a real servitude.\nConstruing the two paragraphs of the will in the light of the conditions established for the length of time mentioned, I have no doubt, as the courts below had none, that the intention of the testatrix, sufficienly expressed by her language, was to impose upon the land given to the son the obligation to furnish sufficient water power for the mills below. She was giving to her daughter mills for operations that had been carried on for generations by water power and it would be absurd to say that she was making the gift subject to the contingency that at the will of the son, the water power could be destroyed by-neglect and the daughter left to look for some other form of power. What was bequeathed was a real servitude for the benefit of the lower lands imposed upon the lands of the appellant immediately above them to allow to pass over and from them sufficient water, furnished by the existing works, to enable the lower mills to be operated, together with the benefit of the subsidiary duty of maintaining the works necessary to the water power as had been done for two centuries: and such a servitude is clearly within Article 555. The substance of it is the right to the flow of the water and the active duty, accessory or ancillary to it: the two constituting the real right as in Dorien v. Seminary of St. Sulpice 11. This is so whether we treat the retaining work of the retenue as in itself a real servitude on lands of another or as being on and part of property belonging to the appellant himself. In each case the duty of maintenance lies within property rights that are ample for that purpose.\nThe point of registration seems to me to misconceive the position of the appellant. Claiming ownership of the retenue and the factory lands, he must necessarily trace his title through the will by which the property was divided, and he is necessarily limited to the rights which that instrument has given to his predecessors. To complain that the will has not been registered is to deny his own source of title. The object of the requirement for registration is to give a third person notice of an independent conveyance from a grantor, but that can have no application when the same instrument conveys the interests to both parties; and Article 2089 of the Civil Code in speaking of \"respective titles\" would seem to put the point beyond any question.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKellock, J.:\u2014By paragraph 4 of her will Dame Zo\u00e9 Turgeon Richard provided in favour of her son Louis, the predecessor in title of the appellant as follows:\u2014\nJe donne et l\u00e8gue avec dispense de rapport \u00e0 mon fils Louis ma manufacture de carton situ\u00e9e \u00e0 l'Ange-Gardien, avec les terrains y attenant et les b\u00e2tisses \u00e9rig\u00e9es sur lesdits terrains et servant \u00e0 l'exploitation de ladite manufacture;\u2026 je lui donne et l\u00e8gue avec dispense de rapport le pouvoir d'eau de la retenue et ce qui sert \u00e0 l'exploiter tels que chauss\u00e9es, digues, ainsi que la maison appel\u00e9e power house.

The flour mill given to the daughter is located a quarter of a mile or so below the cardboard factory.\nThe respondent alleged in the Superior Court that the effect of the will was to create, in favour of 'the property given to the daughter, a real servitude upon the property given to the son, with the obligation resting upon the appellant, as owner, to maintain the barrage so as to supply the necessary water to the respondent's mills. The contention of the appellant is that the will did not create a real servitude, but that if any real servitude were in fact created, it was limited to the locality of the dam at the cardboard mill and it did not extend to the retenue. Appellant lays stress upon the difference in language employed in the two paragraphs of the will quoted and contends that \"le pouvoir d'eau de la manufacture\" in paragraph 7 did not extend to \"le pouvoir d'eau de la retenue\" in paragraph 4.\nThe early history of the retenue is to be found in the judgment of the Superior Court in Quebec Railway Light and Power Co. v. Tremblay, dated May 1, 1901, affirmed by the Court of Appeal on January 11, 1902. These judgments were filed as exhibits at the trial of this action as evidence in this case and the history therein contained is referred to by the learned trial judge in his judgment. It appears that the barrage was in existence before 1756, having been built by the Quebec Seminary for the purpose of diverting the water from the Laval into the Petit Pr\u00e9 to operate the flour mill here in question then owned by the Seminary. In detailing the history of the retenue and the flour mill, the judgment in question uses the following language:\u2014\n\u2026 que ladite retenue, ou chauss\u00e9e avait exist\u00e9 de temps imm\u00e9morial et avait ainsi que ledit canal, toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 poss\u00e9d\u00e9s par le S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec, et avaient toujours servis \u00e0 fournir le pouvoir moteur au moulin de Petit Pr\u00e9, sur la rivi\u00e8re de ce nom.\"\nIn my opinion \"le pouvoir d'eau de la manufacture\" in paragraph 7 of the will is \"le pouvoir moteur\" in the judgment of 1901. If there were no dam at the cardboard mill, as was the fact for many years, the flour mill would operate and could only operate by reason of the water diverted into the De Lottinville by the retenue. The same is true of the cardboard mill. Its motive power derives also from the retenue, the only function of the dam at the mill itself being to make use of the water diverted at the retenue.\nA reference to some of the title deeds in the record is also relevant. By deed of sale of the 31st of May, 1871, the Seminary sold to one, George Benson Hall, the flour mill in question \"avec la retenue sur la rivi\u00e8re Laval et tous les droits qui pourraient s'y rattacher\", which deed was duly registered on the 14th of March, 1881. Hall's widow, Dame Mary Hall, later became the owner, and subsequently, (as appears from an instrument of the 5th of May, 1897) sold to one Tremblay, by deed dated the 16th of November, 1877, and registered on the 17th of December of the same year, all the vendor's rights in the Petit Pr\u00e9 River and all her rights and privileges in the \"pouvoir qui fait mouvoir les moulins \u00e0 farine et \u00e0 carder.\" Evidently a woollen mill had been subsequently erected in the neighbourhood of the flour mill. It is to be observed that at the date of the conveyance to Tremblay, the card- board factory had not yet been built and the water power referred to in the deed was he \"water power which operates the flour and woollen mills.\"\nTherefore, as already stated, it appears clearly that the water power which operates the mill now owned by the respondent owes its existence to the diversion of the Laval River by the barrage at the retenue. This situation was well known to the testatrix, who erected the cardboard factory higher up the stream, to be operated by the same water power. Paragraph 7 itself recognizes that there is only one \"pouvoir d'eau\" whether it be described as \"le pouvoir d'eau de la retenue\" or \"le pouvoir d'eau de la manufacture\". In this paragraph it is provided that if repairs become necessary to the cardboard factory or to the \"pouvoir d'eau lui-m\u00eame\", so that \"le service de l'eau\" is suspended, the daughter shall have no cause of complaint. It is perfectly clear that the only thing which could bring about any suspension in \"le service de l'eau\" to the daughter's mill would be an act done at the retenue which would have the effect of allowing the water above to follow its natural course down the Laval instead of being diverted into the De Lottinville, or by some diversion of the water at some point above the dam at the cardboard mill. No act done at the cardboard mill dam itself could have any such effect. Of this the testatrix was fully aware. Whether the water-power is referred to as \"le pouvoir d'eau de la retenue\" or \"le pouvoir d'eau de la manufacture\" the \"pouvoir d'eau lui-m\u00eame\" is one and the same and any qualifying words are superfluous. This the testatrix recognizes when she drops the qualifying-words and speaks only of \"le pouvoir d'eau lui-m\u00eame\". I think, therefore, that the appellant's argument, founded purely upon the use of a different description in paragraph 4 of the will, from that in paragraph 7, is without significance.\nComing to the appellant's contention that no real servitude was created by paragraph 7 of the will, it is to be noted that this appeal was argued on he basis that the lands on both sides of the river which are in any way relevant to the question under consideration, (with the exception of that on which the barrage at the retenue itself was actually erected) were owned by the testatrix at the time of her death and that, accordingly, the bed of the river also belonged to her; Maclaren v. Atty-Gen. 12.\nArt. 499 of the Civil Code provides that a real servitude is a charge imposed on one real estate for the benefit of another belonging to a different proprietor. It arises either from the natural position of the property, or from the law or it is established by the act of man; Aft. 500.\nOf servitudes which arise from the situation of property, that to which lands on a lower level is subject toward higher lands, is to receive such waters as flow from the latter \"naturally and without the agency of man\"; Art. 501. As far as this article is concerned therefore, there was no obligation on the lands given to the daughter, to receive the additional flow created by the diversion of the Laval River by the barrage at the retenue, nor was there any obligation on the part of the son or attaching to the lands devised to him to permit that flow to pass to the daughter's mill. It was to the securing of the benefit of that flow to the property of the daughter that paragraph 7 of the will was directed. Did this paragraph create a real servitude or merely a personal obligation? The daughter is to have the right to \"have furnished\" to her by Louis the water necessary for the operation of her mill. What does this entail? Would there be any difference if, instead, the will had said that the daughter should have the right \"to take\" the necessary water?\nIn my opinion there would be none. In either case the means by which the necessary water will continue to reach the daughter's lands are by the son being prohibited from doing any act on his lands to prevent that result and by the retenue itself being kept in repair. Both obligations would be involved which ever way the will were expressed and as there is no question but that a real servitude would be created if the expression had taken the second of the two forms mentioned above (Riverin v. Price 13), I see no reason, for holding that the former is not, in the circumstances, equally effective to the same end.\nIt is plain I think from the fact that the son is given a right of way over the lands intervening between his mill and the retenue and the further fact that the daughter is to have no complaint in respect of any interruption in the water supply arising out of the necessity of making repairs to the son's mill or the \"pouvoir d'eau lui-m\u00eame\", that the obligation to maintain the latter is cast by the terms of the will upon the son. In other words, there is a contrary intention shown by the title within the meaning of Art. 554.\nIn Dorion v. Le S\u00e9minaire de St-Sulpice 14, Sir Montague Smith said with respect to the last mentioned article:\nThe obligation to repair a road imposed on one estate for the benefit of the owners of another would prima facie, seem to be a charge within the terms of this article.\nThere can be no more objection to regarding the obligation to repair a dam for the benefit of another estate as a servitude than to so regard the repair of a road. In the judgment just mentioned, reference is made to the old French law by which a servitude was understood to be such that the owner of the servient tenement was only to suffer, and not to do any act. It is pointed out in the judgment however, that writers on the French Code, (which contains a definition and enumeration of servitudes similar to those found in the Civil Code) admit that this principle has been invaded, although these writers qualify the admission by affirming that only such active servitudes as are ancillary to servitudes in their strict meaning are contemplated by the Code. The judgment makes reference also to Articles 553 and 554 and continues:\u2014\nTherefore, the Code contemplates that, in the creation of a servitude, the parties may by contract impose the active maintenance of it upon the servient tenement.\nAs was decided in that case, I think the obligation to repair in this case is part and parcel of the entire servitude imposed upon the properties devised to the son, the servitude being to allow the use of the bed of the river to permit the waters diverted into the De Lottinville by the barrage to flow to the daughter's mills, and to keep the barrage itself in repair. I refer also to Montpetit-Taillefer, Vol. 3, pp. 474-5; Planiol Rippert, Vol. 3, pp. 873-4.\nThe appellant raises another point. It appears that the Seminary, and consequently its successors in title, did not own the land upon which the retenue was erected but built the retenue upon the land of others, with the consent of the owners. The appellant, accordingly, says that he and his predecessors in title have, and had, only a servitude so far as the retenue was concerned and the respondent cannot succeed in its claim as you cannot have a servitude upon a servitude. I think, however, that no such question arises. The appellant owns the barrage, although his right to maintain the structure upon the land is in the nature of a \"droit de superficie\", which is, in itself, a real right; Tremblay v. Guay 15. The servitude created by paragraph 7 of the will here in question in favour of the flour mill premises is a servitude upon the retenue itself which is owned by the appellant. The fact that that structure in turn remains in situ by reason of a servitude upon the lands upon which it is erected has no bearing insofar as the entirely distinct and separate servitude in which the retenue itself is subject is concerned.\nAppellant further contends that, while the will was registered upon the lands in connection with the cardboard mill, it was not registered with respect to the lands upon which the barrage itself is erected and therefore the appellant is met by the provisions of Article 2116 (b) and is not entitled to assert the existence of any real servitude so far as the barrage itself is concerned. Appellant also relies upon the provisions of Article 2085.\nRespondent answers this contention by the submission that the appellant alleges that he is the owner of the barrage, having acquired his title from the trustee in bankruptcy of the son of the testatrix. Respondent says that this being so, it must be taken that the will under which the appellant makes title has been registered not only upon the lands where the barrage stands, as otherwise the registration of the transfer from the trustee to the appellant is, by the express language of Article 2098, without effect. In my opinion the submission on behalf of the respondent is well taken and should be given effect in the circumstances.\nAppellant no longer contends that the barrage was not out of repair at the time of action brought, but he contends that the shortage of water of which the respondent com- plained was not due to this lack of repair but to drought. Appellant points to a recital in an instrument of the 14th of November, 1870, which states that the barrage had the object of diverting into the canal \"part\" of the waters of the Laval River and he contends that the existence in the Laval River in the month of August, 1946, of approximately one-quarter of the flow of the Petit Pr\u00e9 River is consistent with this declaration. However, the judgment in the Quebec Railway case, to which I have already made reference, says that except in periods of flood the Laval River was totally and entirely diverted by the barrage into the canal leading into the Petit Pr\u00e9 and I think this finding, treated as evidence by the parties in this case, is entitled to more weight than the recital in the instrument referred to, which is not shown to have been executed with particular reference to this fact.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nEstey, J. :\u2014The respondent \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\" owns and operates a saw and flour mill on the Lottinville River. In this action it claims a servitude under which from the land of the appellant it has a right to a flow of water sufficient to operate its saw and flour mills and because of and as part thereof the appellant must maintain in good repair \"le pouvoir d'eau de la retenue\" which directs water into the Lottinville River.\nBoth parties claim under the will of Dame Zo\u00e9 Turgeon Richard dated January 5, 1925, who by that instrument gave the property now owned by the appellant to her son Louis Richard, and that now owned by the respondent to her daughter, Zo\u00e9 Richard.\nThe benefits under the will to the respective parties are set out in paras. 4 and 7 of the will, the material parts of which are:\u2014\n4. Je donne et l\u00e8gue avec dispense de rapport \u00e0 mon fils Louis ma manufacture de carton situ\u00e9e \u00e0 l'Ange-Gardien, avec les terrains y attenant et les b\u00e2tisses \u00e9rig\u00e9es sur lesdits terrains et servant \u00e0 l'exploitation de ladite manufacture\u2026 je lui donne et l\u00e8gue avec dispense de rapport le pouvoir d'eau de la retenue et ce qui sert \u00e0 l'exploiter tel que chauss\u00e9es, digues, ainsi que la maison appel\u00e9e power house.

Respondent, on the other hand, contends that in this para. 7 the testatrix created a real servitude which insures the necessary water to operate its saw and flour mills and requires the appellant to maintain and keep in repair the dam at the \"retenue\". It is therefore essential to ascertain the intention of the testatrix as she has expressed herself in he language of her will. Renaud v. Lamothe 16; (1902) 32 S.C.R. 357; In re Brown 17; (1936) A.C. 635; M\u00e9tivier v. Parent 18; (1933) S.C.R. 495; Larose v. Valiquette 19; (1943) 3 D.L.R. 716.\nIn construing the language used by the testatrix one should endeavour to appreciate the position of the testatrix as she executes that will. As stated by Lord Cairns:\u2014\nIn construing the will of the testator,\u2026 it is necessary that we should put ourselves, as far as we can, in the position of the testator, and interpret his expressions as to persons and things with reference to that degree of knowledge of those persons and things which, so far as we can discover, the testator possessed. Bathurst v. Errington, (1877) 2 A.C. 698, at p. 706.\nThe history of the property and the position of the testatrix in this case may be briefly summarized : Over 200 years ago all of the property here in question was owned by \"Le S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec\". The saw and flour mills were then constructed and because the flow of water in the Lottinville River was inadequate a dam at the \"retenue\" was constructed about four miles up stream from these mills which directed the water from the Laval into the Lottinville River and thereby insured sufficient supply to operate the mills. The dam and these mills have been in existence since that time.\nIn 1897 the dam and the saw and flour mills were owned by Richard Tremblay. In that year the testatrix Dame Zo\u00e9 Turgeon Richard constructed a cardboard factory on the Lottinville River between the dam and the saw and flour mills and entered into an agreement with Richard Tremblay which permitted her to use the water from the dam and to enjoy all privileges and servitudes in common with him.\nThen under date of June 17, 1902, Richard Tremblay sold the area, including the dam, the saw and flour mills, to Dame Zo\u00e9 Richard. She thereby became the owner of the entire property here in question and any servitude which existed upon any part for the benefit of any other part thereof was extinguished by virtue of Art. 561 C.C.\nThat in brief indicates the history and the position of the property when the testatrix Dame Zo\u00e9 Turgeon Richard executed her will on January 5, 1925, and that position remained without change until her death on January 17, 1925.\nAfter her death Louis operated the cardboard factory and maintained in repair the dam at the \"retenue\" providing thereby sufficient water for the three mills. When he made an assignment in bankruptcy his trustee sold the mill to the appellant in 1937. The appellant continued to maintain in good repair the dam at the \"retenue\" until in 1944 the cardboard factory was destroyed by fire and was never re-built. Thereafter the appellant having no use for the water failed to maintain in good repair the dam at the \"retenue\", with the result that there was not sufficient water in the Lottinville River to operate the saw and flour mills of the respondent. It therefore brought this action.\nThe testatrix in the foregoing paras. 4 and 7 gives to her son a mill and the dam, and to her daughter two mills, in their own right and indicates a clear intention that these mills should continue to be, as they had always been, operated by water. This general intention is important in the construction of the particular sentences upon which the parties base their respective contentions. In this regard the language of Baron Parke in Quiche v. Leach 20 is pertinent, where after pointing out that Courts ought not to give to words in a will a strained interpretation in order to attain the end which they suppose the testator contemplated, continued at p. 228:\u2014\nAt the same time, the circumstance that the language, if strictly construed, will lead to a consequence inconsistent with the presumable intention, is not to be left out of view, especially if other considerations lead to the same result.\nRinfret, J., (now Chief Justice), speaking for the Court in In re Hammond 21, at p. 409:\u2014\nBut while, for wills as well as for other documents, there are no doubt recognized canons of construction, the cardinal principle\u2014to which any rule is always subservient\u2014is that effect shall be given to the testator's intention ascertainable from the actual language of the will. Indeed the rule itself relied on by the learned Judge as stated in Sir Edward Vaughan Williams' treatise, contains the qualifying words: 'unless, from particular circumstances, a contrary intention is to be collected.'\nThe testatrix died in 1925 and the parties, as already intimated, carried on until 1944, as the respondent contends, in accord with the terms of the will. That, however, does not necessarily follow, as throughout that time first Louis' and then appellant's conduct was consistent with the position appellant now takes that he was maintaining the dam and keeping it in repair because he needed the water for the operation of the cardboard factory and was not, therefore, maintaining the dam as a consequence of any provision in the will.\nIn the construction of this will not only must one, as stated by Lord Cairns, place oneself in the position of the testatrix, but in addition thereto where a question of a servitude is raised the language of Pardessus, Vol. 1, p. 547, is important:\u2014\nPeut-\u00eatre cependant s'il s'agissoit d'une servitude accord\u00e9e par un acte testamentaire, ne faudroit-il pas suivre cette r\u00e8gle \u00e0 la rigueur, parce que la volont\u00e9 de celui qui donne, doit \u00eatre entendue dans un sens avantageux au l\u00e9gataire, qui n'a pu \u00eatre \u00e0 port\u00e9e de rendre la loi claire et pr\u00e9cise. The history of these mills makes it perfectly clear that without the dam at the \"retenue\" they could not be operated with water power. The disposition of these mills, in the light of that history, and the fact that the testatrix created in favour of the cardboard factory a servitude which made the dam at the \"retenue\" accessible for maintenance and repair, indicate a clear intention on the part of the testatrix that she was not only fully aware of the need of the dam at the \"retenue\" but that she intended that these mills should continue to be operated by that water power. If it be suggested that all this was done merely for the son and that the daughter should only enjoy these privileges so long as Louis remained owner of the dam at the \"retenue\" and the cardboard factory, then one is faced with the conclusion that she intended in respect of these mills to treat the son more generously than she did the daughter, which is an interpretation that, apart from express language or clear implication, ought not to be assumed. In this regard the language of Lamont, J. is pertinent:\u2014\nIt is, in my opinion, not sufficient answer for the court to say: 'We do not know what the testator meant by 'advances heretobefore made by me to my children' but as the construction given to it in the court below works an inequality as between the children, the testator could not have meant that'. Hauck v. Schmaltz 22.\nThe appellant particularly relies upon the sentence \"M fille Zo\u00e9 aura le droit de se faire fournir par mon fils Louis, \u00e0 m\u00eame le pouvoir d'eau de la manufacture, l'eau n\u00e9cessaire pour faire fonctionner les moulins que je lui l\u00e8gue pr\u00e9sentement\". This sentence when read and construed in relation to the history, the position of the respective properties at the time the mill was executed and in relation to the other portions of para. 7 does not bear out the appellant's contention.\nThroughout these paras. 4 and 7 the testatrix discloses an intention that all three mills shall be operated by water and for that purpose the flow as it had been maintained for over 200 years should be so continued. Her intention as expressed creates for the benefit of the saw and flour mills a right to the flow of that water over the land of Louis. That such may be a servitude within the meaning of the Civil Code is the effect of Riverin & B\u00e9langer v. Price Bros. Ltd. 23, where at p. 732 Rinfret, J. (now Chief Justice) stated:\u2014\nAs regards 'the right to take the water necessary to run the said grist-mill' it is a servitude established in favour of the mill.\nThe existence of this flow of water is dependent upon the continued existence in good repair of the dam at the \"retenue\" and the passage of it through the Lottinville River to the respective mills. The responsibility for the maintenance of this flow of water as far as the cardboard factory the testatrix placed upon her son Louis and required that he was to make the flow of water available from or out of the water at the cardboard factory for the saw and flour mills.\nThe provisions permitting repairs at the cardboard factory and dam thereat by Louis without incurring liability for damage should he reduce the flow to the saw and flour mills but add to the ambiguity of para. 7. The \"pouvoir d'eau de la manufacture\" might be entirely out of repair even destroyed and neither that nor the repair thereof would result in a diminution of the flow. On the other hand, if the dam at the \"retenue\" should need repair the flow might well be dimnished and that diminution might well continue during the course of the repairs, and upon a strict construction of the language used Louis might be held to have no protection with respect to damage that might result from his effecting repairs at the dam at the \"retenue\". If that is the expressed intention of the testatrix that result must be accepted. However, what is pertinent to the present discussion is that while the testatrix in her will recognizes two reservoirs, one at the \"retenue\" and one at the cardboard factory, she throughout recognizes that there is but one effective reservoir upon which the flow is dependent, and that one at the \"retenue\".\nThe position here is similar to that which obtained in Dorion v. Les Eccl\u00e9siastiques du S\u00e9minaire de St-Sulpice de Montr\u00e9al 24, where Sir Montague E. Smith, speaking on behalf of the Privy Council stated at p. 369 \"that the obligation to make and repair the road formed part of an entire servitude\". So in this case the testatrix, as already stated, provided for the maintenance of the flow of water over the land of her son Louis for the benefit of the saw and flour mills and placed upon her son the obligation to maintain that flow of water.\nI am in agreement with the reasons given by my brother Kellock that the other contentions of the appellant to the effect that a servitude cannot be maintained upon a servitude and with respect to registration cannot be maintained under the circumstances of this case.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Taschereau, Cannon & Fremont.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lapointe, des Rivi\u00e8res & B\u00e9rub\u00e9.\n1 Q.R.

VI, c. 39, s. 42, enacting s. 1025 (1) Criminal Code.\nHeld: The amendment to section 1025 (1) of the Criminal Code, by which any person whose conviction on an indictable offence has been affirmed by a Court of Appeal may, on any question of law, with special leave granted by a judge, appeal to this Court, creates a new right of appeal \"which cannot be construed retrospectively so as to cover cases that arose prior to the new legislation. (Boyer v. The King, [1949] S.C.R. 89.) Held: Even though a new trial ordered by the Court of Appeal was heard subsequent to the coming into force of the new legislation, appellant cannot avail himself of the amendment as the new trial is not the starting point of the proceedings\u2014it is merely the reconsideration of the case under the same indictment.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, dismissing appellant's appeal from his conviction on a murder charge.\nValmore Bienvenue, K.C. for the appellant.\nH. M. Loranger, K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\nTaschereau, J.: In September, 1947, the appellant was originally charged with the murder of Marcel Boileau, and was found guilty in October of the same year. In September, 1948, the Court of King's Bench of the Province of Quebec (Appeal Division) ordered a new trial which was held in November, 1948, and a second verdict of murder was rendered by the jury. The Court of King's Bench (Appeal Division) 2 unanimously confirmed this finding in September, 1949.\nSpecial leave to appeal to this Court was granted on the 21st day of October, 1949.\nThe respondent now raises the question of jurisdiction of this Court and submits that the appellant, having been charged in September, 1947, is still subject to the law, as it existed at that time, and that he may not therefore, even with the permission of one judge, appeal to this Court on a question of law, as he would have the undisputable right, if the proceedings had originated on or after the 1st of November, 1948, date on which the new amendment came into force.\nThere can be no doubt that special leave to appeal granted by a judge of this Court under the new amendment, on a question of law, does not confer jurisdiction on this Court, if otherwise this jurisdiction does not exist. Special leave to appeal is a condition precedent to the right to appeal, but the latter is subordinate to the power of this Court to hear such an appeal. Moreover, I may add that when the application for special leave was heard, the question of jurisdiction of the Court was not raised.\nBefore the 1st of November, 1948, an accused person, convicted of a crime, and whose conviction had been unanimously affirmed by a Court of Appeal, could appeal to this Court by special leave, under section 1025 of the Criminal Code, only when the judgment of the Court of Appeal came in conflict with the judgment of any other Court of Appeal in a like case. However, since the 1st of November, 1948, the law has been amended, and now any person convicted of an indictable offence, whose conviction has been affirmed by a Court of Appeal, may on any question of law, with special leave granted by one judge, appeal to this Court. The jurisdiction of the Court has thus been considerably extended.\nWhen the appellant made his application for special leave, he did not attempt to show that the judgment of the Court of Appeal conflicted with the judgment of another Court of Appeal in a like case, but merely raised questions of law which he argued, were sufficient under the new 'amendment to allow his appeal to be heard by the full Court.\nIt is now said on behalf of the respondent that section 1025 of the Criminal Code as amended, applies only to proceedings that originated after the 1st of November, 1948, and that in view of the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal, it was imperative upon the appellant in order to obtain special leave, to show the existence of a conflict.\nWith this proposition, I entirely agree, as I do not think that the new amendment which creates a new right of appeal, can be construed retrospectively, so as to cover cases that arose prior to the legislation. It is true that the new trial was heard in November, 1948, at a date subsequent to the coming into force of the new legislation, but this new trial ordered by the Court of Appeal under the provisions of section 1014 of the Criminal Code, is not the starting point of the proceedings. It is merely the reconsideration of a case previously heard in October, 1947, which in the opinion of the Court of Appeal had been illegally tried. The indictment is the same, and the new trial is therefore the continuation of proceedings started prior to the new amendment.\nIn the case of Boyer v. The King 3, the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal was given on the 30th of November, 1948, one month after the coming into force of the amendment. On behalf of the appellant it was argued that the judgment of the Court of Appeal, being posterior to the new legislation, he could take advantage of the amendment and obtain leave to appeal on a question of law. The Chief Justice 3, after consultation with all the members of this Court, held that the amendment created a new right of appeal, and had no retroactive effect. It therefore did not apply to pending cases, which, in the view of the Chief Justice, continued to be governed by the former ss. 1 of s. 1025 Cr. C.\nI fail to see how the present case can be distinguished from the Boyer case, and I would therefore quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nAppeal quashed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Valmore Bienvenue.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H.

VIII, c. 49, Art. IV, s. 2(a).\nThe insurers of the cargo of a ship damaged by striking a rock and later beached to prevent sinking brought action to recover damages alleged to have been suffered by the cargo after the beaching, owing to the failure on the part of the captain to direct the use of all available pumping facilities to prevent the entry of further water into the hold and away from the cargo. The trial judge held that there had been such negligence after the beaching but that as it was in a matter affecting the management of the ship the defendant was not liable under the terms of the contract of carriage which incorporated Art. IV, s. 2(a) of the Water Carriage of Goods Act.\nHeld, affirming the judgment at the trial that, assuming there was such a failure on the part of the ship to utilize the available pumping facilities and that damage to the cargo resulted, this was neglect of the master in \"the management of the ship\" within the meaning of s. 2(a) of the statute and the defendant was not liable. Per Taschereau and Locke JJ.: The failure to exercise reasonable diligence to prevent the entry of further water into the forehold was neglect in the navigation as well as in the management of the ship within the meaning of the subsection.\nPer the Chief Justice, Rand and Estey JJ.: The evidence did not establish that any damage was occasioned to the cargo by the entry of water after the beaching.\nThe Glenochil [1896] p. 10; The Rodney [1900] p. 112; The Ferro [1893] p. 38; Good v.

W. de B. Farris, K.C. and J. A. Wright, K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Rand J. was delivered by\nRand J.: In this appeal two determinative questions are raised, one of fact and the other of law, and notwithstanding the conclusion to which I have come on the former, I think it advisable to deal with both.\nA claim is made by cargo insurers against a vessel on the ground that, beyond a certain point, damage done to the cargo consisting of wood pulp was caused by the negligence of captain and crew. At 12.30 a.m. on July 29, 1947 the vessel had sailed from Port Alice on the coast of Vancouver Island bound for Vancouver. At about 2 o'clock, in heavy fog, the ship stranded on a ledge of Cross Island in Quatsino Sound. After being held there for approximately one hour and a half, she slid off and proceeded on the voyage. It soon became evident that water was entering in volume, and the captain decided to make for Quatsino where, if necessary, he could beach the vessel in mud. He arrived at that point in about an hour's time, where he found the dock occupied by a tug. After a short wait, until sinking appeared imminent, he aroused the tug, which withdrew, and the bow was set in a mud bank, northwesterly from the corner of the dock, at approximately 5.40 o'clock. Later, around noon, with the tide rising, he moved the vessel further on to the bank. Next afternoon, a salvage tug, with heavy pumps and a diver, arrived and by late evening the vessel had been brought to condition and trim to return to Port Alice: and following a stay of a few hours there, to continue the voyage to Vancouver. Arriving on August 2nd, the entire cargo was removed and the vessel placed in dry dock.\nIt is admitted that up to and including the beaching at Quatsino, the measures taken by the captain were unexceptionable. The case for the insurers is that from that time on there was negligence in failing to keep the water down and out of the cargo. It assumes that at the moment of beaching, the water in the forward hold, numbered 1 and 2, was not more than 1 1\/2\" above the oil tank tops; and alleges that the available pumping capacity, if properly employed, could have held the water to that level, with the result that the greater part of the loss would have been avoided. It thus becomes necessary to examine these matters in some detail.\nThe factual assumption rests upon conclusions drawn from a visual examination of the hull made on the morning after the vessel was placed in dry dock by a surveyor representing the cargo insurers as well as the general average adjusters. This surveyor, Clarke, at about 9 o'clock on the morning of August 12th, entered the dock and inspected the damage. No one else was around except two laborers. By that time the water had long since drained out of the hull. He found, first, that half a dozen or so rivets had been disturbed, but whether sheared or not he could not say; several were described as \"hanging\" but he denies that any were quite out, that is, through both plates entirely; there was a fracture of one of the forward keel plates about 14\" in length, 3\/8\" at its greatest width aft and tapering to a light hair crack forward: and the keel plate and strakes Nos. 1, 2 and 3 on the port side were buckled for upwards of 20 feet. From these facts he calculated the area of the opening through which the water could have entered, and at this point it will be better to use his own language: \"I first took my calculations, this ruptured plate, without going into many difficult calculations for a mere 2 or 3 per cent, the roughness of the hole and the shape, but taking it as a plain orifice which is 2\" square, \u215c\" by 14 is equal to 2\" square, a plain orifice. Then I allowed for the seven rivets, the allowance for those seven rivets was 1.54 square inches \u2026 I estimated those rivets at \u00be\". I didn't measure them but thought they were \u00be\". If they are smaller it would be less, if larger slightly more. It made a total of 4 square inches that water could enter that ship. Now by a simple method I found with 4\" we get 70 tons per hour that can leak into that ship at a 25 foot draft.\" Later on he was questioned in relation to the buckled plates:\nQ. Do you mean to say there wouldn't be any water go in between those buckled parts?\nA. No.\nQ. No?\nA. I have allowed for \u00bd\" to go in there.\nQ. That's where you have allowed it to go in? You haven't allowed anything. What have you allowed for rivets other than these seven?\nA. I have given in my opinion decimal five of the total area estimated. Instead of.5, .3 would have been more accurate. I allowed.3 to cover any other rivets.\nQ. Where the rivets are out\u2014\nA. There were none out entirely.\nThere is some error in this evidence; 2\" square is 4 sq. inches: 14\" by \u215c\" is 5.25 sq. inches and half of it, 2.6. But disregarding that, on the basis of an orifice of 4 sq. inches, estimating the varying head of water and the discharge by the bilge pump, started when the vessel grounded and kept up throughout, he computed the net intake of water up to beaching. This was then extended for the 14 hours from that time until 8 o'clock in the evening when he arrived on the scene, making 16 hours in all. He concluded that in that period 880 tons had entered the forepeak and the forward hold, an average of 55 tons an hour, and that the quantity held when he arrived was 412 tons, leaving 468 tons to have been discharged by the pump, at an average of 29 tons an hour. In the course of half an hour, he noticed a rise at the aft end of the forward hatch combing on the port side of 2\"; the water was then within one foot of the 'tween deck and he assumed it to have been rising continuously from the morning; but admittedly a shifting of cargo then going on could explain in part at least the apparent rise of 2\". Nor is his conclusion that there had been a constant rise unchallengeable; considering the position of the vessel and the likelihood of the damaged portion, at low water, being imbedded in the bank, the probabilities are that the level had lowered and risen. When put ahead ait noon on a high tide, the vessel was afloat and the damaged parts would then be exposed and the admission of water most likely freer. During the first two hours, from the sliding off the ledge to the beaching, 137 tons, on his basis, would have entered: deducting from this 58 tons pumped out, 79 tons would remain: 44 tons were required to fill \/l tank, and 5 would be in the forepeak: of the remaining 30 tons, half would be absorbed in the pulp and the rest would present the level stated, 1\u00bd\" above the tank tops. From this it is seen how the result follows mathematically from the assumed area of entrance and the quantity on his arrival. The latter may for our purposes be accepted and the former becomes the determining factor.\nClarke also estimated that the vessel would go down one foot in the head for each 100 tons of water in the hold. When leaving Port Alice, the draught was 16 feet fore and 17' 11\" aft. As the net quantity admitted up to the beaching was 79 tons, it would follow that between Cross Island and Quatsino the bow would not be more than one foot below trim. On Clarke's arrival at Quatsino he judged the draught to be 24'-25'. The captain at the time of beaching, with the tide low, looking for the marks by the aid of a torch, had seen that the last one, 21', was below water. Discounting somewhat Clarke's estimate by reason of the fact that it represents an excessive distance of 9 feet submergence of the bow from trim, and having regard to tide and beaching, these, opinions are not greatly in conflict and indicate approximately the same weight of water. To the captain this meant \"imminent danger\"; the vessel was \"going perceptibly by the head\": in the words of the first officer, \"she was settling fast.\" On the run back to Port Alice, Clarke thought the head had been down about 9 feet which he says did not seriously affect the steering; and in his opinion there could have been no or very little difficulty from such a cause in bringing the vessel into Quatsino.\nNow the datum so gathered and its conclusions, apart from a confidential communication made to his principals and to counsel, were disclosed to no one until presented in evidence at the trial. By every other person interested, from captain to adjuster, it was assumed that the water at the time of the beaching had reached a level that accounted substantially for all of the damage. In his report of survey, Clarke stated that \"all damaged cargo\u2026 was as a consequence of striking the rock at Cross Island, \u2026\" He claimed to have passed on his discovery to the surveyor for the hull insurers, Warkman, although apparently his calculations had not then been made. Here is what he said:\nQ. But beaching didn't cause any damage, not a word about all the things that did cause it?\nA. I don't think they are called for.\nQ. We have gone over that question. The underwriters needed to know\u2014\nA. The principle involved in these remarks was reported to, was discussed with Mr. Harry Warkman, who represented the underwriters on the other side. I was not doing it entirely without the knowledge of the representatives of the ship knowing my thoughts in the matter.\nQ. It's awfully nice, though, afterwards to have it down in black and white what your thoughts were, especially when you start to put them down and then stop?\nA. I spoke on the ship to Mr. Harry Warkman.\nQ. You never put anything in black and white?\nA. It was more or less agreed with Harry Warkman, but the full extent was not estimated until recently.\n* * *\n\"Q. Who was the surveyor?\nA. Harry Warkman, I discussed it with him. We came to the conclusion it was impossible just by observing, I don't suppose Mr. Warkman has ever gone and taken any figures on the matter. It was just a specimen.\nQ. What was it you decided was impossible?\nA. For that amount of water to pass into the ship immediately it slid off the rocks.\nQ. Immediately.\nA. Within the trip across, impossible for 400 tons of water to pass through that damage on the trip across.\nQ. Do you know how long the trip across took?\nA. Yes, just about an hour, approximately.\nQ. Did you figure out with Mr. Warkman how much would go in?\nA. No, I did not. Warkman denied having been informed of this matter. The trial judge accepted generally the evidence of Clarke but this particular feature is not mentioned. There can be little, if any, doubt that in the secrecy in which Clarke made his inspection and thereafter concealed the information, it would be against all probability that he would communicate matters to Warkman as would make clear the significance of what he now exhibits; there is no suggestion of confidence, and it would have been to run too great a risk of making them common knowledge, which Clarke had no intention of doing. Conceivably some reference might have been made to apparent smallness of openings through which the water entered, but not being clearly associated with the alleged failure in pumping, it would not be significant; and after two years, it is not surprising that Warkman, who had been called hurriedly as a witness, should not recall it; but if its full implication had been revealed, not only Warkman but others through him, would have heard of it. In view of the unusual secrecy, I cannot conclude that an effective disclosure was made to Warkman. Clarke, in cross-examination, suggested the manager of the shipyards should be able to confirm the facts as he gave them, but, as would have been expected, the manager recalled nothing of what at the time carried no importance; but he did say that \"no one, I think, could tell approximately what the leak was.\"\nThere are other facts to be weighed with the estimates of Clarke. The diver who likewise was called hurriedly gave a clear statement of what he found. His account of the rivet holes was definite that in some cases the rivets had been forced out completely, and that the suction had drawn his thumb into the holes. There was one significant item of damage related by him; he found two or three open seams, two or three feet in length, formed by the separation of hull plates where they overlapped each other. These he plugged with wedges which were seen by Warkman at the shipyard: \"Two rows of wooden wedges had been driven in leaking seams.\" These plates had all been badly buckled for as much as 15 feet, as the specification for repairs of Warkman and the evidence of Smith make abundantly clear; in fact the surfaces were described as corrugated; and the bow had been twisted to almost a right angle toward the starboard. Clarke had not mentioned seams at all on his direct examination and his later reference to them already quoted was mixed up with the rivet holes. There is this further statement by him:\nQ. Did you make a close examination of all the buckled plates?\nA. I walked along and closely observed all the landing, (s?)\nQ. Yes?\nA. For possible leaks. I could find nothing there.\nQ. Is it correct to say you found nothing else that would cause\u2014\nA. Any serious leaks, with the exception of the rivets and the fracture of these plates.\nHe was not recalled. Rebuttal evidence explained that the plates could be opened at the outer edge of the overlap and the rivet broken or bent without affecting the inner contact of the plates and in that way the mere existence of the seams did not mean an entrance for water. Against this there are two considerations: the rebuttal dealt with plates in their normal condition and did not take into account the wavy buckling present here; and the diver's evidence was that the wedges were put in because he felt the suction of the water into the hull. The captain says \"the plate laps were open \u2026 I didn't measure the exact distance these plates were open but I saw a large outflow of water which was still taking place from damage to the hull: there was a large outflow of water from these holes.\" The latter was not seen by Clarke, and the trial judge implies no questioning of the truthfulness of the captain.\nAs is not wholly unknown in pretentions to completeness and infallibility, it is quite evident that in this seeming mathematical demonstration one important factor at least in the estimate of the area of the openings has been omitted. Apart from the evidence already quoted, it is obvious that any estimate based upon such an examination would be of dubious dependability, except in a gross sense, for the purposes intended. The proper test would have been to put water into the forehold under pressure or a known head and to ascertain its rate of outflow. By that means the state of things Clarke was seeking to confirm might have been established; but this would have eliminated surprises and he would have run the risk of having his basic datum falsified.\nThere is another circumstance to be considered. On the way to Quatsino the steering had become difficult, the head, in the opinion of the captain and first officer, being down 4'-6', on arrival, and, as already stated, beaching was made in what the officers considered a state of sinking. On the return trip to Port Alice, there could not have been more than 250 tons of water in the hold, but Clarke says the head was down 9 feet. According to the scale of the plan of the vessel, this depth would bring the draught above the water line. On Clarke's mathematics, 9 feet would represent 900 tons of water, about double the capacity of the forehold'. The forward 'tween deck cargo had been unloaded at Quatsino and the tank in \/4 hold had been filled with water. When the vessel arrived at Port Alice, she was \"fairly dry\", as agreed to by Smith with appellant's counsel. At that point about 250 bales of pulp screenings, deck cargo, had been shifted from forward to aft; and on setting out for Vancouver the fore draft was 20' 5\" and aft, 19'. These facts seem to be quite inconsistent with the conclusions formed by Clarke as to the conditions on the run from Cross Island: and I see every reason to accept the statement of the captain that the vessel was down several feet, sufficient to interfere with the steering and to justify his serious apprehension; and that it was considerably less than 9 feet on the return to Port Alice is undubitable.\nIn the light of all of these matters, including the convinced judgment of the ship's officers that the hold was virtually filled before beaching, it would be entirely too dangerous to ground this substantial liability upon the too plausible deductions of Clarke; there was no danger, once he had found what he thought to be the facts, of losing the evidence of them before they could be verified, if that had been desired: the insurers at that time were in fact in complete command of the vessel; they could have taken any step thought desirable to ascertain any condition or obtain or preserve or confirm evidence of negligence; and the failure to do so, although entirely within the right of Clarke, supports an inference from undisputed or unquestionable facts against his conclusions which his method risked.\nI do not think the evidence makes out failure of the officers after beaching. Mr. Bull contends that the onus is on the ship owner to free himself from what is charged. The statement of claim alleges negligence and gives particulars of it, and on the issues so raised the parties went to trial. Proof was assumed by the plaintiff; but even if we take the initial burden to be on the defendant, a prima facie case for perils of the sea was made out and the onus of showing negligence to displace that thereupon shifted to the plaintiff: The Glendarroch 2.\nThe question of law is this: assuming neglect to use the available pumping capacity and its responsibility for part of the damage done, was it an omission in relation to the care owed to the cargo or in the management of the ship? The bill of lading incorporates the Articles of the Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1936: by Article III (ii):\u2014\nSubject to the provisions of Article TV, the carrier shall properly and carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for and discharge the goods carried.\nand Article IV (ii) provides that:\u2014\nNeither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from\n(a) act, neglect, or default of the master, mariner, pilot or the servants of the carrier in the navigation or in the management of the ship;\nThese uniform provisions have been considered in a number of cases in the English courts, culminating in that of Gosse Millerd Limited v. Canadian Government Merchant Marine 3. In that case it was laid down by the House of Lords that whether the act resulting in the damage to the cargo is one in the management of the ship depends upon the circumstances in which it operates. There the cargo was damaged by the entrance of rain through an uncovered hatch. As the particular use of the tarpaulin was in relation to the protection of cargo only, the omission to keep it over the hatch was neglect in maintaining that protection and not in the management of the vessel.\nIn the circumstances here there is likewise an omission, but the omission of an act which, as alleged to be necessary for the proper care of the goods, is at the same time claimed to be required in the management of the ship. Mr. Farris' contention is that there was a duty on the captain to utilize the full pumping capacity not only for the general safety of the ship but also specifically to prevent a collapse of the bulkhead between the forehold and the engine room; if the pressure of the cargo and the water had broken through that barrier, the vessel would have been in the gravest danger; and measures of anticipation would be acts of management. That view of the situation was accepted by Smith, J. and I respectfully concur in his conclusion. The further question is whether an act or omission in management is within the exception when at the same time and in the same mode it is an act or omission in relation to care of cargo. It may be that duty to the ship as a whole takes precedence over duty to a portion of cargo; but, without examining that question, the necessary effect of the language of Article III(ii) \"subject to the provisions of Article IV\" seems to me to be that once it is shown that the omission is in the course of management, the exception applies, notwithstanding that it may be also an omission in relation to cargo. To construe it otherwise would be to add to the language of paragraph (a) the words \"and not being a neglect in the care of the goods.\"\nOn both grounds, therefore, the respondent succeeds, and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nEstey, J.:\u2014The appellant, owner of a cargo of wood pulp sulphide on the ss. \"Nootka\" from Port Alice, B.C. to Vancouver, B.C., claims against the respondent as owner of the \"Nootka\" for damage to the cargo en route.\nThe \"Nootka\" left Port Alice at 12.40 a.m. D.S.T. on July 29, 1947; fog was soon encountered and at 2.01 a.m. the vessel grounded on Cross Island. A rising tide enabled the ship to slide off at 3.40 a.m. It was immediately realized that water was coming into the head of the \"Nootka\" and the captain determined to proceed to Quatsino Wharf where he arrived at 4.43 a.m. At the Quatsino dock the ship was sinking so fast that the captain grounded her in the mud. A diver was sent to Quatsino and after an examination of the ship and temporary repairs the \"Nootka\" left July 30th at 5.09 p.m. and arrived back at Port Alice at 7.39 p.m.\nIt has been conceded throughout this litigation that there was no negligence on the part of the master and the crew aboard the \"Nootka\" up to its arrival at Quatsino. The learned trial Judge 4, however, found that at Quatsino the failure to pump efficiently with the available facilities had allowed the water to rise in the ship and to further damage the cargo. He held that 68 per cent of the damage to the cargo was caused by this negligence but as this negligence was in relation to the management of the ship he hel dthe respondent not liable by virtue of the Water Carriage of Goods Act, S. of C. 1936, c. 49, Schedule Art. IV, sec. 2(a).\nThe appellant in this appeal contends that the negligence at Quatsino was not in relation to \"the management of the ship\" and therefore the respondent does not come within the above mentioned Art. IV, sec. 2(a). The respondent cross-appeals and contends that all of the damage was caused prior to the ship reaching Quatsino and therefore consequent upon acts in relation to \"the management of the ship.\"\nThe first issue is, therefore, whether upon the facts as found by the learned trial Judge the respondent is liable under Art. III, sec. 2, or not liable because of the provisions of Art. IV, sec. 2(a), or more precisely stated, was the pumping of the water out of the \"Nootka\" conduct in \"the management of the ship\" within the meaning of that phrase as used in Art. IV, sec. 2(a).\nArt. III, sec. 2, of the said Schedule reads as follows:\nSubject to the provisions of Article IV, the carrier shall properly and carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for and discharge the goods carried.\nArt. IV reads in part as follows:\n2. Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from,\n* * *\n(a) act, neglect, or defeault of the master, mariner, pilot or the servants of the carrier in the navigation or in the management of the ship.\nThe origin and history of the foregoing provisions are discussed in Scrutton on Charter parties, 15th Ed., p. 439. Similar provisions were enacted in the United States in 1893 and in Canada in 1910. The immediate provisions are the result of recommendations for the adoption of the \"Hague Rules\" with slight modifications as a basis of legislation at the diplomatic conference on Maritime law at Brussels in October, 1922. The Imperial Economic Conference in 1923 recommended the adoption of the rules throughout the British Empire with the consequence that the Schedule to the Canadian Act is identical with that of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act in Great Britain, 1924.\nLord Sumner states the purpose and object of the foregoing legislation to be as follows:\nThe intention of this legislation in dealing with the liability of a ship-owner as a carrier of goods by sea undoubtedly was to replace a conventional contract, in which it was constantly attempted, often with much success, to relieve the carrier from every kind of liability, by a legislative bargain, under which he should be permitted to limit his obligation to take good care of the cargo by an exception, among others, relating to navigation and management of the ship. Obviously his position was to be one of restricted exemption.\nGosse Millerd Ltd. v. Canadian Government Merchant Marine 5.\nIn the Gosse Millerd Case the House of Lords considered a claim against the ss. \"Canadian Highlander\" for damage to a shipment of tinplates from Swansea to Vancouver. The ship went from Swansea to Liverpool where cargo was both loaded and unloaded. When undocking at Liverpool the \"Canadian Highlander\" suffered injuries and was placed in dry dock for repairs. The damage to the tinplates was caused by negligence in moving and replacing tarpaulins while the vessel was in dry dock which permitted rain water to reach and damage the tinplates. It was held that this negligence in handling the tarpaulins was not negligence in the management of the ship and therefore the case was not brought within the proviso of Art. IV, sec. 2(a) and therefore the owners of the \"Canadian Highlander\" were liable under Art. III, sec. 2. Lord Sumner at p. 240:\nI think it quite plain that the particular use of the tarpaulin, which was neglected, was a precaution solely in the interest of the cargo. While the ship's work was going on these special precautions were required as cargo operations. They were no part of the operations of shifting the liner of the tail shaft or scraping the 'tween decks.\nIn the Gosse Millerd Case Lord Hailsham, L.C. approved of the principle laid down in The Glenochil 6. \"The Glenochil\" in the course of a voyage from New Orleans to London encountered exceptionally heavy weather. While unloading and loading cargo at London it was necessary to fill some of the water-ballast tanks in order to stiffen the ship. The learned trial Judge there found that if before admitting the water into the ballast tanks an examination had been made the broken pipes through which the water passed into and damaged the cotton-seed; oil-cake would have been discovered. He held failure to make such an examination constituted negligence causing the damage, but that it was negligence in \"the management of the ship\", and the owners, therefore, were not liable by virtue of Art. IV, sec. 2(a). His judgment was affirmed upon appeal. Sir F. H. Jeune, President, stated at p. 15:\n\u2026 the Act prevents exemptions in the case of direct want of care in respect of the cargo, and secondly, the exemption permitted is in respect of a fault primarily connected with the navigation or the management of the vessel and not with the cargo.\nGorell Barnes, J. at p. 19:\n\u2026 where the act done in the management of the ship is one which is necessarily done in the proper handling of the vessel, though in the particular case the handling is not properly done, but is done for the safety of the ship herself, and is not primarily done at all in connection with the cargo, that must be a matter which falls within the words \"management of the said vessel.\"\nIn The Rodney 7, a pipe to carry off water became clogged and was cleared in such a negligent manner as to make a hole in it and permit water to damage the cargo. This was held to be negligent conduct in the management of the ship and therefore under Art. IV, sec. 2(a) the owners did not incur liability for the damaged cargo. Sir F. H. Jeune at p. 117:\nThe acts need not be done merely for the safety of the vessel or for her maintenance in a seaworthy condition. If you extend them to keeping the vessel in her proper condition, then the act in this case is an act done in the management of the vessel, and falls within the principle of The Glenochil.\nAnd Gorell Barnes, J. at the same page:\nI think that the words \"faults or errors in the management of the vessel\" include improper handling of the ship, as a ship, which affects the safety of the cargo.\nSee also The Touraine 8.\nIn The Ferro 9, a quantity of oranges, because they were so placed in the vessel were damaged. The owners were held liable due to the provisions under a bill of lading containing language similar to the above quoted passages from the Schedule. Gorell Barnes, J. at p. 46:\nIt seems to me a perversion of terms to say that the management of a ship has anything to do with the stowage of cargo. The ss. Germanic 10 arrived at New York with a heavy coat of ice estimated at 213 tons. This weight was increased by a heavy fall of snow after her arrival. In the course of unloading cargo and loading coal the vessel listed first to starboard, later to port, and then after a short time again to starboard, and finally about four hours later listed to port carrying the lower part of the open coal port below the water line where the pumps could not control the inflow of water, as a consequence of which the ship sank before relief could be had. At the trial, and this was affirmed in the Circuit Court of Appeals, the loss was found to be due to hurried and imprudent unloading. This finding was accepted in the Supreme Court of the United States where it was held that the negligence was not due to the management of the ship. Mr. Justice Holmes stated at p. 597:\nIf the primary purpose is to affect the ballast of the ship, the change is management of the vessel, but if, as in view of the findings we must take to have been the case here, the primary purpose is to get the cargo ashore, the fact that it also affects the trim of the vessel does not make it the less a fault of the class which the first section removes from the operation of the third. We think it plain that a case may occur which, in different aspects, falls within both sections, and if this be true, the question which section is to govern must be determined by the primary nature and object of the acts which cause the loss.\nThe foregoing authorities make it clear that the management of a ship is not restricted to acts done in relation to the ship while she is sailing. They rather indicate that the line is drawn where the conduct is, in the language of both Gorell Barnes, J. and Mr. Justice Holmes, primarily in relation to the management of the ship as distinguished from acts in relation to the cargo. The conduct of the master and crew prior to beaching at Quatsina was in relation to the management of the ship. The placing of the vessel in the mud in order to prevent her sinking was an act for the preservation of and therefore in relation to the management of the ship. The pumps were started at Cross Island and were kept going all the time the vessel was at Quatsino. The appellant stresses the fact that the master said once the \"Nootka\" was beached at Quatsino she was safe. He, however, explained she was safe unless some unfortunate accident occurred. He had in mind and mentioned the possibility of the bulkheads giving away which would be a major accident. In order to avoid this it was necessary that the pumps be kept working. The fact that there was negligence in the operation of these pumps does not affect the matter if, as I think, they were operated for the preservation of and therefore were acts in relation to the management of the ship.\nThe master was, as his duty required, concerned about the cargo. When scows were available at 4.00 p.m. they began unloading the pulp from hold \/l. However, the master was obviously of the opinion that whatever damage had been suffered by the cargo had been suffered prior to the landing at Quatsino.\nThe primary concern of the master in keeping the pumps going was to get as much water out as he could so that the bulkheads would not give way and that possibly the ship might continue her course. That being the primary concern, the fact that the pumping did tend to preserve or affect \"the safety of the cargo\", as stated by Gorell Barnes, J. in The Rodney, supra, does not take the case out of the exception of Art. IV, sec. 2(a). This was damage resulting from an act relating to the ship, and as stated by Bankes, L.J., in Hourani v. T, & J. Harrison 11, \"only incidentally damaging the cargo.\" It was conduct such as Gorell Barnes, J. in The Glenochil, supra, refers to as \"not primarily done at all in connection with the cargo.\" The conclusion must follow that the pumping of the water out of the \"Nootka\" was conduct in the management of the ship and therefore the facts bring this case within Art. IV, sec. 2(a).\nThe respondent cross-appealed and contended that the water which caused the damage was in the hold before the ship was beached at Quatsino and that all the damage was done before beaching. I agree that the evidence justifies this conclusion and concur in the analysis of the facts as made by my brother Rand.\nThe cross-appeal as such was unnecessary within the meaning of Rule 100 of this Court. The respondent in supporting the judgment at trial had a right to raise all the points which he did without a cross-appeal. In the result the appeal should be dismissed with costs including all of the costs of preparing the factum. The cross-appeal should be dismissed without costs. The judgment of Taschereau and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nLocke, J.:\u2014The appellants as plaintiffs in these consolidated actions brought in the Exchequer Court, British Columbia Admiralty District 12, claim to recover from the defendant railway company as the owner and operator of the ss. Nootka, for damage to cargo carried in that vessel occasioned under the following circumstances. On July 29, 1947, shortly before 1 o'clock in the morning the Nootka sailed from Port Alice for Vancouver and at about 2 a.m. of the same day ran aground in a dense fog on Cross Island in Quatsino Sound. The vessel carried some 8,000 bales of wood pulp sulphite, the property of the plaintiffs in various proportions and, of this, part was carried' in two forward holds known as Nos. 1 and 2 which formed together one common hold with two hatches leading into it. This combination hold, referred to in the reasons for judgment at the trial as the fore hold, consisted of the lower hold and 'tween decks, and cargo was stored in each. The space forward of the hold was occupied by the fore peak which, except for some ship's gear, was empty. The damage claimed is in respect of injury caused by sea water which gained access to the fore hold at some time following the stranding.\nThe Nootka remained aground on Cross Island for approximately one hour and forty minutes and then slipped off on the following tide. The first officer had ascertained by an examination that in the fore peak she was beginning to make water, though no significant amount obtained entry into her until she slid off the rock but, according to both the master and the first officer, within a very short time after this there was difficulty in handling the vessel and they discovered she was going down perceptibly by the head, indicating that she was making water rapidly. The master then decided to proceed to Quatsino Wharf and to run her aground oh a mud bank immediately ahead of the wharf and this was done. According to him, they commenced to operate the bilge pumps promptly after the vessel slid off the rock but this was insufficient to keep down the water gaining entrance to the vessel, so that by the time she was tied up at Quatsino Wharf at 4.43 a.m. she was considerably below her draft marks forward. The plaintiffs do not complain of any neglect on the part of the defendant up to the time the Nootka arrived at Quatsino Wharf. They do, however, dispute the accuracy of the evidence of both the master and the first officer as to the amount of water which had gained entrance into the ship by the time she arrived there. According to the ship's officers, such a large quantity had gained entrance into the fore hold by that time that all of the damage sustained by the cargo had been suffered. The evidence for the plaintiffs, which has been accepted by the learned trial judge, indicated, however, that a comparatively small amount of water had entered the vessel up to that time and it is the plaintiffs' case that it was the negligence of the crew thereafter which caused almost all of the damage to the cargo which ensued. The learned trial judge, however, while deciding this issue in favour of the plaintiffs held them disentitled to recover by reason of the provisions of sec. 2 of Art. IV of the Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1936, and dismissed the action. The plaintiffs appeal from this decision and the defendant has cross-appealed on the ground that it was error on the part of the trial judge to find as a fact that the damages claimed by the plaintiffs were caused after the arrival of the vessel at Quatsino Wharf. If the statute is an answer to the claims of the plaintiffs, the question of fact raised by the cross-appeal need not, in my opinion, be considered.\nThe case of the plaintiffs is that when the Nootka arrived at Quatsino Wharf and was beached in the mud there was only some 1 \u00bd inches of water in the hold above the top of the fuel oil tanks, it having been kept at this level by the use of the bilge pump only and that had the ship's officers promptly put to work other pumps then readily available the water could have been kept either at or below this level and much the greater part of the damage which was occasioned to the cargo in the forehold prevented. It is said that the master failed in his duty to protect the cargo by neglecting to use the available pumps, so that when the surveyor for the cargo underwriters arrived at the vessel at 8 o'clock in the evening there was some 13 or 14 feet of water in the hold, it being above the 'tween deck level. As a result of arrangements made after the arrival of Captain Clarke, the surveyor, the hold was pumped out with the available pumps but the damage had, of course, then been done.\nThe carriage by sea of the cargo in question was from Port Alice, B.C. to Vancouver and the rules prescribed by the Water Carriage of Goods Act (cap. 49, Statutes of Canada, 1936) applied. By sec. 2 of Art. III it is provided that:\u2014\nSubject to the provisions of Article IV, the carrier shall properly and carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for and discharge the goods carried.\nIt is said, however, for the defendant that if there was failure on the part of the ship's officers to care for the cargo no action lies by reason of the provisions of Art. IV, sec. 2(a) which provides that:\u2014\nNeither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from,\n(a) act, neglect, or default of the master mariner, pilot or the servants of the carrier in the navigation or in the management of the ship.\nThese statutory provisions are taken verbatim from the rules relating to bills of lading contained in the schedule of the Carnage of Goods at Sea Act 1924 (Imp.) 14 & 15, Geo. V, c. 22. That statute which was enacted as a result of the recommendations made at the International Conference on Maritime Law held at Brussels in 1922 follows closely in this respect the language of the Harter Act, which had been enacted by the Congress of the United States in 1893. As pointed out in Scrutton on Charter Parties, 15th Ed. p. 263, the Imperial Statute, imitating the Harter Act, draws an implied distinction between negligence in the navigation or in the management of the ship and negligence otherwise than in such navigation or management. From the consequences of the former it allows the ship owner to be relieved, while from those of the latter it does not.\nNeither the Canadian or the Imperial Statute or the Harter Act attempt to define the meaning or effect of the words \"navigation\" or \"management\". In Gosse Millerd, Ltd. v. Canadian Government Merchant Marine Ltd. 13, Lord Hailsham, L. C. pointed out that the expression \"management of the ship\" while first appearing in an English Statute in the Carriage of Goods at Sea Act 1924, had a long judicial history in that country and expressed the opinion that the words should be given the meaning which had been judicially assigned to them when used in contracts for the carriage of goods by sea prior to its enactment. In the present matter the learned trial judge, after stating that he accepted fully the evidence of Captain Clarke, including his conclusions as to the quantity of water in the vessel at the time it arrived at Quatsino Wharf, said that if the measures taken by Captain Clarke after his arrival at 8 p.m. to clear the fore hold of water had been taken by her own officers when she was first beached, the rise of water in the hold would have been checked and 68 per cent of the damaged cargo saved and said in part:\u2014\nWhat I think tends to obscure the real issue here is the circumstance that the rising water had such an immediate damaging effect on the cargo, and only that might be relatively regarded as a remote effect on any ship operation. But that cannot matter. Had soundings been taken on arrival at Quatsino Bay (or before) and the ship's actual condition ascertained and appreciated, and the water then in the ship pumped out or reduced in volume (as 1 have found it could and should have been with the vessel's facilities then available) the ship would again have come to life; she would once more have become a going concern, might even perhaps have found it possible to get under way and move under her own power to Port Alice, 12 miles distant, for survey and temporary repairs. The failure to pump efficiently with all facilities at hand most certainly damaged further cargo, but it was essentially a failure in a matter that vitally affected the management of the ship, viewed in the light of the authorities. It was a \"want of care of vessel indirectly affecting the cargo\"; or so it seems to me.\nFor the defendant it is said that if the findings of fact of the learned trial judge be correct, then the neglect or default of the master or other servants of the carrier was in \"the navigation or in the management\" of the ship, within the meaning of Art. IV, sec. 2(a).\nThe meaning to be assigned to the words \"improper navigation\" in an agreement was considered in Good v. London Steamship Owners' Association 14. By the agreement the members of the Association undertook to indemnify each other in respect of \"loss or damage which by reason of the improper navigation of any such steamship as aforesaid may be caused to any goods, etc. on board such steamship.\" The ss. Severn, while on a voyage from Memel to Hull, encountered heavy weather and being short of coal put back to Frederickshaven to coal and to trim her cargo which had shifted. Going into the harbour she grounded but got off within an hour and the pumps were put on to try whether she had made any water and, for this purpose, the bilge-cock was opened but through the negligence of the crew was not closed when the attempt to pump ceased. While the vessel was moored at the quay, orders were given to fill the boilers and for this purpose the sea-cock was opened\u2014this communicated with the box or tank in which was the bilge-cock\u2014and when the boilers were filled, the sea-cock being through a like negligence left open, the water entered in large quantities by means of the open bilge-cock and damaged the cargo. This was held to be damage from improper navigation, Willes, J. saying in part (p. 569):\u2014\nImproper navigation within the meaning of this deed is something improperly done with the ship or part of the ship in the course of the voyage. The omission to close the bilge-cock was clearly improper navigation within the meaning of this deed. It was improper navigation in the course of the voyage.\nIn Carmichael v. Liverpool Sailing Ship Owners' Association 15, similar language in the articles of a mutual insurance association was considered. While loading a cargo of wheat, an opening or port in the side of the vessel was negligently left insufficiently secure so that water gained access to the cargo and caused damage. The matter came before A. L. Smith and Wills, JJ. by way of a stated case and the neglect was held to fall within the expression \"improper navigation.\" On appeal, Lord Esher, M.R. and Fry, L.J. agreed with A. L. Smith and Wills, JJ. that the decision in Good v. London Steamship Owners' Association, above referred to, concluded the matter. Lopes, L.J. said in part (p. 251):\u2014\nIn my opinion improper navigation means the improper management of a ship in respect of the cargo during the voyage.\nIn The Ferro 16, damage caused to cargo by negligent stowage was held by Sir Francis Jeune and Gorell Barnes, J. to be not within the expression \"neglect or default in the navigation or management of the ship\" in a bill of lading. In The Glenochil 17, goods were shipped under a bill of lading incorporating the provisions of the Harter Act. After arrival at her port of destination and during the discharge of the cargo it became necessary to stiffen the ship. For this purpose, the engineer ran water into a ballast tank but negligently omitted first to ascertain the condition of the sounding-pipe and casing which had, owing to heavy weather during the Voyage, become broken. Damage to the cargo ensued. The action failed, the loss being held to fall within the exception from liability for \"faults or errors in the management\" of the vessel. Sir Francis Jeune said in part:\u2014(p. 14)\nIt is sufficient for us to say that it is negligence consisting in a mismanagement of part of the appliances of the ship, and mismanagement which arose because it was intended to do something for the benefit of the ship, namely, to stiffen her, the necessity for stiffening arising because part of her cargo had been taken out of her. In that operation of stiffening there was a mismanagement of a pipe and the result was that water was let in and damaged the cargo.\nand expressed the opinion that the Act permitted the exemption in respect of a fault primarily connected with the navigation or management of the vessel, and not the cargo. The learned President did not consider that it was necessary to deal with the matter as a question of navigation, saying that (p. 16)\nthe word \"management\" goes somewhat beyond\u2014perhaps not much beyond\u2014navigation, but far enough to take in this very class of acts which do not affect the sailing or movement of the vessel, but do affect the vessel herself.\nand said that in The Ferro the distinction he intended to draw was one between \"want of care of cargo and want of care of vessel indirectly affecting the cargo.\" Gorell Barnes, J. said in part (p. 19):\u2014\nI think that where the act done in the management of the ship is one which is necessarily done in the proper handling of the vessel, though in the particular case the handling is not properly done, but is done for the safety of the ship herself, and is not primarily done at all in connection with the cargo, that must be a matter which falls within the words \"management of the said vessel\".\nIn The Rodney 18, the exemption contained in the Harter Act was again considered. There the vessel meeting with heavy weather and the forecastle becoming flooded the boatswain, while endeavouring with the aid of a poker to clear a pipe used to carry off the drainage, drove a hole through it, thereby admitting water into the forehold and damaging a portion of the cargo. Following the decision in The Glenochil the action failed. The President in delivering judgment reversing the decision of a county court judge, referring to the reasons given by the latter in finding for the plaintiff that the word \"management\" should be confined to the performance (though improper) or non-performance of such acts as are or ought to be done for the safety of the vessel and her maintenance in a seaworthy condition, said that this was too narrow a view and that the acts need not be done merely for the safety of the vessel or for her maintenance in a seaworthy condition, but extended to keeping the vessel in her proper condition. Gorell Barnes, J: agreeing, said that nothing that was said in The Glenochil was intended to limit the meaning of the words \"management of the ship\" to acts done for the safety of the ship but included improper handling of the ship as a ship, which affects the safety of the cargo. In Rowson v. Atlantic Transport Co. 19, Stirling, L.J. adopted the views expressed in The Glenochil and The Rodney, and in Hourani v. Harrison 20, Atkin L.J. noting this fact adopted the statement of Gorell. Barnes, J. in The Rodney that \"faults and errors in the management of the vessel include improper handling of the ship as a ship which affects the safety of the cargo.\" In the Gosse Millerd case, above referred to, Lord Hailsham, L.C. expressly approved the principle laid down in The Glenochil, saying that the principles enunciated in that case had repeatedly been cited with approval in England and noting that they had been applied in The Rodney and accepted by the Court of Appeal in Rowson's case and adopted as correct by the Supreme Court of the United States in cases arising under the Harter Act.\nThe relevant language of the Harter Act has been considered in a large number of American cases. The statute was enacted in 1893 and in The Sylvia 21, Gray, J. delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court said in part:\u2014\nThis case does not require a comprehensive definition of the words \"navigation\" and \"management\" of a vessel, within the meaning of the act of Congress. They might not include stowage of cargo, not affecting the fitness of the ship to carry her cargo. But they do include, at the least, the control, during the voyage, of everything with which the vessel is equipped for the purpose of protecting her and her cargo against the inroad of the seas; and if there was any neglect in not closing the iron covers of the ports, it was a fault or error in the navigation or in the management of the ship.\nand noted that this view was in accordance with the English decisions, referring, inter alia, to Good v. London Steamship Owners' Association, Carmichael v. Liverpool Sailing Ship Owners' Association, The Ferro and The Glenochil. In The Sanfield 22, Wallace J. delivering the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the failure to open a sluice gate designed to empty the bilges which was neglected for twenty days during heavy weather was a fault pertaining to the management of the ship, within sec. 3 of the Harter Act, adopting the above quoted language from the judgment in The Sylvia.\nHere, upon the facts found at the trial, the master having brought his ship safely to the wharf with only a small quantity of wtaer in the forehold and having by causing her to be grounded on the mud bank obviated the danger of her sinking, did nothing to prevent the rise of water in the forehold other than to continue to use the bilge pump which was, as the result showed, quite inadequate. Thus, the ship lay from early in the morning of July 29, 1947, until after 8 o'clock that evening, when Captain Clarke arrived, and having ascertained that there were some 13 or 14 feet of water in the forehold was instrumental in initiating measures which pumped the hold dry and, with the assistance of some temporary work on the hull done by a diver, enabled her to return to Port Alice and thence to Vancouver. There were, as was demonstrated after Captain Clarke's arrival, sufficient pumps immediately available to have kept the hull dry or practically so had they been put promptly to work when the vessel arrived at the wharf. Admittedly, the Captain knew that the vessel was taking water rapidly as she lay at the wharf. He apparently, however, erroneously considered that having consulted the engineer regarding the use of pumps he had discharged his duty.\nAccepting the findings of fact made by the learned trial judge, that there was negligence on the part of the master appears to me to be undoubted. That this negligence resulted in damage to the cargo is equally beyond question. Any negligence in failing to take prompt steps to avoid the inroad of seawater into the holds of a vessel carrying perishable cargo must, in my view, be also negligence either in the navigation or the management of the ship. It is said for the appellant that when the Nootka was run aground at Quatsino Wharf she was safe from sinking, so that the failure to operate the available pumps did not jeopardize the safety of the vessel and that the presence of the large accumulation of water in the forehold did not constitute a danger to the bulkhead, but I think it must be accepted upon the authority of The Rodney that this is not decisive of the matter. Navigation, as indicated by the decisions in Good v. London Steamship Owners' Association and Carmichael v. Liverpool Sailing Ship Owners' Association, does not refer merely to the time when the vessel is at sea. The decision in The Accomac 23, is clearly distinguishable on the facts, for there the voyage had ended at the time the events occurred giving rise to the claim. I think the failure to exercise reasonable diligence to prevent further water entering the forehold falls within the same category as the failure of the crew to close the bilge-cock in Good's case, and the port in Car-michael's case, and was \"neglect in the navigation of the ship\" within the terms of the exception. The learned trial judge considered the matter as one of negligence in the management of the ship and, having come to a conclusion on this aspect of the matter, no doubt considered it unnecessary to decide further whether there was not also negligence in the navigation of the ship. The same neglect may, in my opinion, be 'both in navigation and in management. Adopting the language of Gorell Barnes, J. in The Rodney, there was here improper handling of the ship as a ship which affected the safety of the cargo and this was fault or error in management. The learned trial judge has said that the neglect was essentially a failure in a matter that vitally affected the management of the ship, a conclusion with which I respectfully agree.\nIn view of my conclusion upon this aspect of the matter, I express no opinion upon the issue raised by the cross-appeal. It was unnecessary for the respondent to cross-appeal. Rule 100 provides that a notice of cross-appeal may be given by the respondent if it is intended upon the hearing of the appeal to contend that the decision of the court below should be varied. Here the action was dis- missed by the learned trial judge upon the ground that the fault established was negligence in the management of the ship, for which the respondent was not liable. The respondent did not seek to have the decision varied. The respondent was entitled to support the judgment upon any tenable ground and all of the arguments advanced upon the cross-appeal in support of the contention that the respondent had not been negligent might have been advanced on its behalf.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs which should include all taxable costs in connection with the preparation of the factum, including that portion thereof directed to the question as to whether the respondent had been guilty of negligence. Under the circumstances, I think the dismissal of the cross-appeal should be without costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs; cross-appeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Bull, Housser, Tupper, Ray, Carroll and Guy.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

Husband and Wife\u2014Summary Proceedings for Maintenance\u2014The Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 211. The Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1927, c. 36, s. 750(c) as enacted by S. of C., 1947, c. 55, s. 23, provides that an appellant, if the appeal is from an order whereby a penalty or sum of money is adjudged by a justice to be paid, shall within the time limited for filing the notice of intention to appeal, in cases in which imprisonment in default of payment is not directed, deposit with such justice an amount sufficient to cover the sum so adjudged to be paid together with such further sum as such justice deems sufficient to cover the costs of the appeal.\nOn Feb. 17, 1948 the deputy judge of the Family Court of Toronto under the Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act, R.S.O., 1937 C. 211, ordered the appellant to pay his wife at the said Court the sum of $15 per week for her support, the first weekly payment to be made on March 1. On Feb. 24 appellant paid to the Court the sum of $25 as security for the costs of an appeal to the County Court, the amount fixed by the Court as such security, and on Feb. 26 served and filed notice of appeal.\nHis appeal to the County Court was dismissed on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, and an application for an order of mandamus made to the Supreme Court of Ontario was refused by a judge of that court and on appeal by the Court of Appeal, on the ground that the provisions of s. 750(c) of the Criminal Code were not complied with.\nHeld: that at the time the appellant served and filed his notice of appeal there was no \u201csum of money adjudged to be paid\u201d and the appellant had done all that was required of him in order to vest jurisdiction in the County Court.\nHeld: also, that the appeal should be allowed, the order below set aside and a writ of mandamus directed to be issued to the County Court to proceed with the hearing of the appeal.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing appellant\u2019s appeal from the judgment of Smiley J. who refused appellant\u2019s application for an order of mandamus directing a judge of the County Court to hear appellant\u2019s appeal from an order of the Toronto Family Court directing payment by the appellant of the sum of $15 per week for the support of his wife.\nH. Gordon Webb in person for the appellant.\nNo one appearing for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice, Kerwin, Rand and Estey JJ. was delivered by:\nKERWIN J.:\u2014On February 17, 1948, the Deputy Judge of the Family Court for the City of Toronto ordered Doctor Harry Gordon Webb to pay his wife \u201cat the Family Court, 90 Albert Street, in the City of Toronto, the sum of $15 per week for the support of the wife of the said Dr. Harry Gordon Webb, the first weekly payment to be made on the 1st day of March, 1948.\u201d The order was made under the Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act, R.S.O. 1937, chapter 211. On February 24, 1948, Webb paid to the Family Court $25 as security for the costs of an appeal to the County Court (the amount fixed by the Family Court Judge as such security), and on February 26 served and filed notice of appeal. A County Court Judge decided, purporting to follow the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Johnson v. Johnson[1], that the County Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.\nWebb thereupon applied for an order of mandamus directing a judge of the County Court to hear and determine the appeal. This application was dismissed by Smiley J., as was also an appeal to the Court of Appeal. In each case the application was refused on the ground that the provisions of section 750(c) of the Criminal Code as enacted by section 23 of chapter 55 of the Statutes of 1947 were not complied with. Under the Deserted Wives\u2019 and Children\u2019s Maintenance Act, proceedings are to be in accordance with the provisions of the Ontario Summary Convictions Act, R.S.O. 1937, chapter 136. By virtue of section 13 of the latter, an appeal is given in such a case as this to the County Court, and by section 3, certain sections in Part XV of the Criminal Code, including section 750(c) shall apply mutatis mutandis.\nThe only decision besides the Johnson case referred to, so far as we are aware, was Fink v. Fink[2] There Kellock J.A., with whom Gillanders J.A. agreed, decided that the giving of a cheque was not a \u201cdeposit\u201d but he did not determine whether the \u201camount sufficient to cover the sum so adjudged to be paid\u201d would be the sum of $7, which was the only sum falling due to be paid under the order of the magistrate at the time notice of appeal was given, or the amount of all payments that would fall due under the order between its date and the date upon which the notice of appeal was returnable, or some other amount. I do not read the judgment of the Chief Justice of Ontario as deciding anything beyond that except to point out that it was generally considered that compliance with section 750(c) was a condition precedent. At that time that part of section 750(c), dealing with appeals in cases where imprisonment in default of payment is not directed, provided for the entering into a recognizance as an alternative to the payment of the deposit. In the Johnson case, which was an application for prohibition, which on appeal came before the Ontario Court of Appeal, that Court granted an order of prohibition where cheques had been given instead of cash. By that time the section as we now have it had been enacted omitting the provision for entering into a recognizance. Notwithstanding this alteration, the question left open in the Fink case was still undecided.\nIt is now necessary to decide the precise point. The matter does not lend itself to extended discussion but a reading of the whole of section 750(c) satisfies me that the appellant had done all that was required of him in order to vest jurisdiction in the County Court. Section 750(c) as enacted in 1947 reads as follows:\u2014\n(c) the appellant, if the appeal is from a conviction or order adjudging imprisonment, shall either remain in custody until the holding of the court to which the appeal is given, or shall within the time limited for filing a notice of intention to appeal, enter into a recognizance in form 51 with two sufficient sureties before a county judge, clerk of the peace or justice for the county in which such conviction or order has been made, conditioned personally to appear at the said court and try such appeal, and to abide the judgment of the court thereupon, and to pay such costs as are awarded by the court or enter into a recognizance so conditioned and make such cash deposit in lieu of sureties as the justice may determine; or if the appeal is from a conviction or order whereby a penalty or sum of money is adjudged to be paid, the appellant shall within the time limited for filing the notice of intention to appeal, in cases in which imprisonment upon default of payment is directed either remain in custody until the holding of the court to which the appeal is given, or enter into a recognizance in form 51 with two sufficient sureties as hereinbefore set out, or deposit with the justice making the conviction or order an amount sufficient to cover the sum so adjudged to be paid, together with such further amount as such justice deems sufficient to cover the costs of the appeal; and, in cases in which imprisonment in default of payment is not directed, deposit with such justice an amount sufficient to cover the sum so adjudged to be paid, together with such further amount as such justice deems sufficient to cover the costs of the appeal; and upon such recognizance being entered into or deposit made the justice before whom such recognizance is entered into or deposit made shall liberate such person if in custody.\nThe part italicized deals with the situation that confronted the present appellant. I cannot conceive that, if the appellant had served and filed his notice of appeal and deposited the sum deemed sufficient by the justice to cover the costs of the appeal, after one payment had fallen due under the order, he would have been required to pay anything more than that one payment. It might be, as in fact was the case, that some considerable time would elapse before his appeal would be heard, and it could never have been the intention that the appellant should make further deposits from time to time until the appeal was heard. In my view, there was no \u201csum * * * adjudged to be paid\u201d at or before the time the appellant served and filed his notice of appeal.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the order below set aside and a writ of mandamus directed to be issued to the County Court to proceed with the hearing of the appeal.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014I concur in the allowance of this appeal and in the granting of a writ of mandamus.\nAppeal allowed.\n[1][1948] O.W.N. 532.\n[2] [1944] O.W.N. 172; 81 C.C.C. 196.\n",

Bruce (Defendants) Respondents.\n1949: November 14, 15; 1950: February 21.\nPresent: Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand, Estey and Locke JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nLabour Law\u2014Trade Unions\u2014Union Officials told general contractor, that in event of sub\u2011contractor employing non-union labour the union men would not work on the job, as a result sub-contract was cancelled\u2014Whether act of Union Officials unlawful interference with sub-contractor\u2019s contractual relations.\nA general contractor under an agreement with a Union, of which the respondents were officers, undertook to employ on its contracts only union labour for that class of work in which the Union engaged. Having secured a contract for a building project it assigned part of the work to a sub-contractor which also employed only union labour. The latter, in the belief that the appellant was also an employer of union labour, gave a contract for part of such work to the appellant and the general contractor sharing the same belief, approved. The respondents, on learning of the contract awarded the appellant, advised the general contractor that their Union under the circumstances would be unable to supply it with union labour for other work of the same general nature as that awarded the appellant. The general contractor then told its sub-contractor that non-union men could not work on the job and the sub-contractor then advised the appellant that any men he employed there must be union men, and the appellant agreed.\nAt the time the appellant secured his contract he was aware of the Union\u2019s rule forbidding its members to work with non-union men engaged in the same class of work, and of its further rule whereby it entered into collective agreements with the Master Plumbers Association only and not with individual master plumbers such as the appellant. Notwithstanding, he made no effort to join the Master Plumbers Association, nor did his workmen apply to join the Union. He however attempted to negotiate with the Union through the respondents but without success. The contract he had obtained was thereupon terminated by mutual consent and he then brought action against the respondents claiming they had conspired to interfere with his contractual relations.\nHeld: The respondents as officers of the Union were within their rights in advising the general contractor of the consequences that would ensue if the appellant carried out his contract by the employment of non-union labour. The evidence did not support the contention that they conspired to injure the appellant, nor that any acts on their part, or of either of them, was the cause of the cancellation of the appellant\u2019s contract.\nSmithies v.

Walsh, K.C., and Thomas Delaney, K.C., for the appellant.\nA.W. Roebuck, K.C., and D.R. Walkinshaw for the respondents. The judgment of Kerwin, Taschereau and Estey, JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nESTEY J.:\u2014The appellant (plaintiff) carries on business as a master plumber, steamfitter and sprinklerfitter in the City of Hamilton and brings this action against Barker, business agent of Local 67 in Hamilton of the United Association of Journeymen Plumbers and Steamfitters of the United States and Canada (hereinafter described as the \u201cunion\u201d where the general association is referred to, or \u201cLocal 67\u201d if only the local association is referred to), and the defendant Bruce, official organizer for Canada of the union.\nThe appellant\u2019s contention is that the respondent Barker conspired with the members of Local 67 and the respondent Bruce to injure and obstruct by unlawful means the appellant in pursuit of his business, in consequence of which the W.H. Cooper Construction Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Cooper Company\u201d) cancelled a large contract with the appellant for work upon the Proctor & Gamble building in Hamilton.\nThe appellant\u2019s claim for damages and an injunction have been rejected both at trial and in the Appellate Court.\nThe evidence is largely concerned with the contracts in respect of the construction in 1945 of a large building for Proctor & Gamble Company of Canada Limited in Hamilton. H.K. Ferguson Company Inc. of Cleveland had the contract for its construction and entered into a sub-contract with the Cooper Company for the construction thereof, except that it would itself install \u201call the new equipment and all the process piping work, and oil refinery, and all those various processes that they use on refining for their soap business.\u201d Moreover, the plans were prepared by H.K. Ferguson Company Inc. and its engineers and those of Proctor & Gamble Company of Canada Limited. H.K. Ferguson Co. Inc., had a project manager to whom the Cooper Company had to answer and who approved of all sub-contracts let and materials purchased by the company. A.C. Davis was the project manager. H.K. Ferguson Company Inc. had an agreement with the union under which it could employ upon the construction of this building only union men. Moreover, the constitution of the union provided that no member of the union was permitted to work on any job where non-union men were employed on similar work.\nThe Cooper Company called for tenders for some of the plumbing and steamfitting they were required to do under the contract and as a result offered a contract to Adam Clark Company. Adam Clark Company did not feel, because of their other work, they had sufficient men to undertake this contract, with the result that it was then offered to the appellant. When appellant indicated his willingness to accept, he was told by the Cooper Company to go ahead. He did so, doing a small amount of work and ordering some materials. H.K. Ferguson Company Inc. through its representative Davis approved of Cooper Company accepting appellant\u2019s tender. At that time neither Davis nor Cooper knew appellant employed non-union men.\nWhen Barker heard of the possibility of the appellant, who employed non-union men, getting this sub-contract, he immediately communicated with Bruce. Bruce at once, on November 8, 1945, spoke to Davis as follows:\u2014\nI called his attention to the fact that Mr. Newell was a non-union employer and that it would interfere with all of the rest of his operations * * * I made it clear to him that if he desired to have the rest of his work done by members of the United Association, in accordance with the terms of our agreement, that he would have to see that union men were employed on that other work.\nDavis immediately spoke to the Cooper Company:\u2014\nI told Mr. Cooper that a non-union man could not work there, because I expected to do a lot of industrial work, and the International men would not work along with them on the same job, which he knew.\nRalph Cooper up to that time understood the appellant hired union men and in fact stated that had he known appellant was not employing union men he would not have offered him the work on this building. Ralph Cooper immediately told appellant \u201cI want it clearly understood that all men that you put on the Proctor & Gamble project must be union men.\u201d The appellant admits that the Cooper Company so insisted. He also acknowledges that he knew that union and non-union men could not work on the construction of this large building because of the union rules, and says that he immediately endeavoured to make a contract with the union that would permit him to do so.\nAppellant\u2019s first approach to the union was on Saturday, November 10, when he and Barker had a conversation on the street. The respective versions of this conversation are quite different except that it is agreed appellant asked that he be permitted to sign a contract with the union. Whatever Barker\u2019s precise reply may have been, he did not encourage appellant, who interpreted his attitude as a refusal. Early that afternoon appellant advised Ralph Cooper to that effect. Ralph Cooper then communicated with Barker and as a consequence, on the following Monday, November 12, Barker, Bruce, Cooper and Davis met at a conference. As to the discussion at this conference there are again contradictions as to the precise language used, but it appears that Bruce did in effect intimate that he could not prevent the Cooper Company contracting with the appellant, but if non-union men were employed he would have difficulty in supplying the men to H.K. Ferguson Company Inc. on their part of the work. The qualifications and possibility of appellant\u2019s men joining the union were discussed, as well as that of an agreement or arrangement by which appellant might be permitted to employ union men, but no progress was made toward the attainment of this end. It was agreed at this conference that the Cooper Company would again approach Adam Clark of the Adam Clark Company and Bruce stated that if that company would undertake the contract he would endeavour to get the necessary men.\nWhen Cooper advised the appellant that at this conference nothing had been attained on his behalf, the latter requested a further delay of four days and said that he would write a letter \u201cover the heads of Bruce and the business agent.\u201d That same evening at about nine o\u2019clock appellant delivered his letter to Barker. In the course of his evidence he refers to his letter as his written application for a contract with the union. It is not an application; on the contrary, it states he had made application on Saturday to Barker which was refused, and that refusal confirmed at the conference on Monday, November 12. He then states that refusal is an interference with his legal rights and unless it is withdrawn in four days he would be forced to take legal action.\nWhen appellant delivered this letter to Barker at the latter\u2019s home a conversation took place between the two but no progress was made.\nBarker says he showed the letter to Bruce. He also placed it before his executive but no action was taken and no reply was made thereto.\nWhen on November 19 the position remained unchanged, the Cooper Company notified appellant they were \u201cunable to enter into the contract\u201d and at its request he signed the following release:\u2014\nI hereby accept the above notice and release you from all responsibility or liability or damages which I have suffered or may sustain by reason of your being unable to enter into such contract.\nYours very truly,\nW. Newell.\nThe learned trial Judge found that a contract had been concluded between the Cooper Company and the appellant. As it is upon this basis the case may be considered most favourably to the appellant, I accept, as did the learned Judges in the Court of Appeal, that finding.\nThe evidence discloses that Bruce and Davis at their conversation on November 8 discussed not only the employment of non-union men by the appellant but work which Davis himself had under consideration. It was not a disagreeable conversation. No demands were made. If there is a conclusion suggested by the evidence it is that Davis realized his error in approving of appellant\u2019s contract and that he would see that only union men were employed. Neither Bruce nor Davis as to this or any other occasion deposed to language used by Bruce which would support a submission that H.K. Ferguson Company Inc. was threatened, intimidated, coerced or in any way forced to take the position which it did. In this regard the case is quite distinguishable from Smithies v. National Assoc. of Operative Plasterers[3], and Larkin v. Long[4]. Immediately Davis realized the inconsistent position of his company was due to his having approved of the appellant\u2019s contract, without a clause providing for the employment of union men, he took steps to have it, in this regard, rectified.\nThe respondents, as officers of the union and Local 67, were quite within their rights in advising Davis of appellant\u2019s employment of non-union men and the difficulties that the employment of non-union men upon the construction of this building would involve. Local Union No. 1562, United Mine Workers of America v. Williams and Rees[5].\nThe appellant immediately took steps to comply with the Cooper Company\u2019s condition and his complaint after November 8 is to the effect that they conspired to prevent him from obtaining a contract with the union.\nThe evidence discloses that Local 67 enters into agreements with the Master Plumbers\u2019 Association at Hamilton but not with individual master plumbers. It therefore follows that master plumbers in that city deal with the union through the Master Plumbers\u2019 Association. The members of the union are journeymen plumbers who are received into membership upon receipt of individual applications.\nAppellant was familiar with the methods and activities of the Master Plumbers\u2019 Association, the union and Local 67. He had been in business at Hamilton since 1920. At one time he had been a member of the Master Plumbers\u2019 Association and chairman of one of their committees. He employed union men from 1920 to 1934 except for a period of fifteen months commencing in 1929 when, because of some disagreement, the union did not permit their men to be employed under him. In the course of his evidence he detailed a number of differences, commencing in 1923, between himself and the union until in 1934 he dissociated himself from the union and has since maintained a non-union shop. He explained that so long as he was content with small contracts there was no interference on the part of the union but in large contracts the union insisted that only union men should be employed and that as union men would not work along side non-union men the presence of the latter on the job stopped the work.\nThe appellant, notwithstanding this knowledge, placed his tender and when offered the work indicated his willingness to accept. He neither at that time nor at any time material to this litigation made an effort to become a member of the Master Plumbers\u2019 Association. His efforts to obtain the right to employ union men was directed to Local 67 and the union. His first approach was on Saturday morning, November 10, when he met Barker on the street and asked to sign a contract with the union. Apart from the fact that some such request was made, the contradictions between these parties as to this conversation are such that it is impossible to ascertain precisely what happened, but it is clear that no progress was made and that afternoon appellant reported to Ralph Cooper that Barker refused to grant him a contract with the union. Then Ralph Cooper arranged for the conference, which took place on Monday, November 12, when Davis, Cooper, Bruce and Barker were present. When this conference failed to advance his position toward the attainment of a contract, appellant asked Cooper for a further delay of four days. This was granted and that evening the appellant wrote and delivered to Barker the letter dated November 12. Throughout this letter, as well as throughout his conversation with Barker, he does not indicate any change in his opinion respecting the union, which he frankly admitted he had often criticized as being unfair to him and not having adhered to its constitution. It was open to the union and respondents to conclude, particularly because of their past disagreements and no indication of any change in his views, that appellant\u2019s main concern was that he get a contract with the union which would give him the privilege of carrying out his contract with the Cooper Company. In any event, the union had a right to take the position that it would deal only with master plumbers who were members of the Master Plumbers\u2019 Association and that journeymen plumbers should individually apply for membership. The appellant did not endeavour to obtain membership in the Master Plumbers\u2019 Association in Hamilton and through that association to deal with the union, nor did the journeymen plumbers in his employ apply for membership in Local 67.\nAppellant selected his own method for making his application to the union and pressing for its acceptance. It was not in accord with the practice of the union. We need not speculate as to what position the union would have taken had appellant become a member of the Master Plumbers\u2019 Association. It is sufficient that he did not do so at any time material hereto, and the union was within its rights in these circumstances in not formally considering his application until he had done so.\nAppellant\u2019s contract was suspended as of November 8 but not cancelled until the 19th of November. The intervening time was given to appellant because of his assurance that he would make arrangements with the union. When on November 19 he had not succeeded, at the request of the Cooper Company he signed the release.\nThroughout the evidence establishes that the respondents did no more than what they individually conceived to be their respective duties as officers of the union and Local 67. The evidence as to their conduct does not support a conclusion that they conspired or in any way agreed or combined to injure the appellant. The evidence does support the finding of the learned trial Judge:\u2014\nI am not prepared to find there was anything in the actions of the defendant Bruce inconsistent with an endeavour to have the agreement between the Union and the Ferguson Company lived up to and to assist it and the Cooper Construction Company in carrying out their respective contracts under the conditions of such agreement plus possibly a desire to secure with respect to that job and future jobs the employment of Union men.\nThe evidence does not support a conclusion that Bruce in communicating with Davis, or any language or acts on the part of Bruce and Barker or either of them was the cause of the cancellation of appellant\u2019s contract. It rather leads to the conclusion that Davis acted upon his own judgment and just as he would have acted had he otherwise learned or discovered that non-union men were being or would be employed on the construction of this building. In these circumstances there was no interference on the part of the respondents with contractual relations within the meaning of the oft-quoted statement of Lord Macnaghten in Quinn v. Leathem[6], in referring to Lumley v. Gye[7].\n* * * that a violation of legal right committed knowingly is a cause of action, and that it is a violation of legal right to interfere with contractual relations recognized by law if there be no sufficient justification for the interference.\nThe evidence does not support any of the appellant\u2019s allegations with respect to the existence of a boycott on the part of the respondents.\nThe appellant asks that conclusions favourable to his contention be drawn from the record in Bruce\u2019s diary of Thursday, November 8, reading in part: \u201cHamilton, with B.A. Barker. We met Mr. Davis of H.K. Ferguson Co. on Proctor Gamble job\u2014and had Newell case disposed of,\u2014saw W. Clark and Adam re job and need of taking on work.\u201d\nOn Thursday, November 8, Bruce visited Hamilton. He saw Davis, as already intimated, and because of the latter\u2019s complete acquiescence with respect to his company\u2019s obligation to employ only union men, he recorded \u201chad Newell case disposed of.\u201d On the same day Bruce interviewed Clark of the Adam Clark Company and assured him that if he would take the contract he (Bruce) would do his best to supply the necessary men. Bruce did not, nor did he purport to, effect a contract between Adam Clark Company and the Cooper Company. It is not suggested he had any authority to do so. Moreover, Ralph Cooper states that at the conference on Monday, November 12:\u2014\n* * * and finally we decided that we would go back and talk to the Adam Clark organization and see if they would take the job on.\nBruce\u2019s conduct both on November 8 in interviewing Clark and his conduct on November 12 does not appear to be any different from that of a union man who was anxious to have the employers act within the limits prescribed by the union rules and when they did so that he would exert his best effort to see that the necessary men were provided and thereby delays avoided.\nThe appellant objected to secondary evidence of the agreement between H.K. Ferguson Company Inc. and the union. Appellant had indicated upon the examination for discovery that he would insist upon the production of the original if evidence of this agreement was sought to be adduced. As a consequence, respondent Bruce asked his head office in Washington, D.C., for the original. He did not specify the date, and as apparently a new contract is signed every year and his request was made in 1947, head office sent him the 1947 contract. Bruce says he was familiar with both of these contracts and that certainly the sections material to this litigation were identical and that he did not notice the date until the trial. He then wired for the 1945 original which covered the time material to this action and was advised that because of the confusion in moving their offices it could not be found. This evidence does not establish either that it was lost or destroyed. It was out of the jurisdiction, but it is clear that reasonable efforts would have obtained it. On the part of the respondents secondary evidence, therefore, was not admissible. Porter v. Hale[8].\nAppellant overlooks, however, that as part of his own case he adduced in evidence through his witness Ralph Cooper:\u2014\n\u201cWell, the H.K. Ferguson Company have an agreement with A.F. of L. steamfitters and pipe men in the States, and of course we have to have union men on this job, so,\u201d he said, \u201cyou had better check into this immediately.\u201d\n* * * I called Mr. Newell and said to him, \u201cI want it clearly understood that all men that you put on the Proctor & Gamble project must be union men. We want no difficulty. Cooper Company have for years hired nothing but union men, we have nothing but the finest co-operation from the union and it has to be a union job.\u201d Mr. Newell said, \u201cAll right, I will take care of that,\u201d and he said, \u201cyou leave it with me for a few days.\u201d\nAnd again:\u2014\nQ. Taking this specific contract, this P. & G. Contract, would you have been able to hire him on this P. & G. Contract if you knew he did not hire union men?\u2014A. Not with the set-up, not with the agreement which the Ferguson Company had with the A.F. of L. Union.\nAnd the appellant himself deposed:\u2014\nIn the large contracts it is generally in the closed shops, and it is mandatory for the union members when making agreements that they have a clause inserted there, they must have a sympathetic clause, and no agreements are permissible by the head office, United States, unless the Association the defendants belong to has that clause. And again:\u2014\nThat stops the whole job, through my interference, would term it, by not having union men on the job. The union men won\u2019t work side by side with the non-union men.\nIf a party in the conduct of his own case adduces inadmissible evidence, he cannot subsequently complain if that evidence be taken into account in determining the litigation. Goslin v. Corry[9]. This is upon the same principle that evidence adduced to which objection was not taken at the proper time cannot be objected to upon an appeal.\nBoth parties are bound by the view taken of their respective cases and the mode of conducting them by their counsel at the trial and they cannot look for a new trial on grounds admitted to be urged at N.P. * * * and where evidence has been admitted without objection as relevant to the issue, it cannot be objected to as inapplicable after the judge has begun to sum up.\nRoscoe\u2019s Evidence in Civil Actions, 20th Ed., p. 235; Phillip v. Benjamin9; Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd Ed., sec. 18, p. 323.\nThe foregoing evidence of Ralph Cooper, which is supported by that of the appellant, justified the statement of the learned trial Judge:\u2014\nThe Ferguson Company had an agreement with the United Association of Journeymen Plumbers and Steamfitters of the United States and Canada to use all Union men and of which Bruce was apparently aware.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario should be affirmed and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nRAND J.:\u2014The courts below have concurred in finding that there was no direct object or purpose by individual or concerted action of the respondents to injure the business of Newell, the appellant. The general building contractor had awarded to Newell certain work of plumbing and heating, and upon that fact coming to the notice of the respondents, they drew to the attention of the Engineering Company, which was entrusted with the total construction, the fact that, in those circumstances, they would be unable to supply union labour required for other work of the same general nature as that awarded Newell. The International Union, which the respondents in dif- ferent capacities represented, had a written agreement with the Engineering Company that only union employees for that class of work would be engaged on constructions undertaken by them. It was also a rule of the Union that members would not work on a job in association with non-union labour of the same class except in special cases approved by named officers.\nIt is now established beyond controversy that in the competition between workmen and employers and between groups of workmen, concerted abstention from work for the purpose of serving the interest of organized labour is justifiable conduct. Crofter Harris Tweed v. Veitch[10], is the latest authority for this view, and it clarifies the distinction between such action for an object or purpose of the sort mentioned and an agreement of two or more to injure a competitor. In the analysis made by Viscount Simon, in particular, of such and similar purposes as they have been exemplified in the leading cases from Mogul S.S. Company v. McGregor, Gow & Co.[11], Allen v. Flood[12], and Quinn v. Leatham[13], to Sorrell v. Smith[14], the purpose of malice, as meaning either malevolence or a primary intent to injure a competitor, as distinguished from an incidental effect of a predominating purpose of another nature, and that of strengthening or defending a recognized and accepted social interest, are elaborated and differentiated; and where we are not troubled with questions of mixed or multiple purposes, as we are not here, the legal result in the ordinary case presents little difficulty.\nThe purpose, therefore, of the respondents as found, which the evidence, I should say, clearly supports, having been to serve the interest of the Union and not having been directed at injury to Newell, the action of the respondents would have been unexceptionable if its effect had been merely to influence the building contractor not to enter into an engagement with Newell. But there was an existing contract which the building contractor elected to bring to an end; and the question is whether that circumstance gave an objectionable character to the conduct of the respondents.\nWhat they did was, at most, to refuse to authorize the union men to work on the job or to persuade them not to do so while a certain condition of things existed. There was no act of which, on the foregoing conception of legitimate conduct, the appellant could complain. A building contractor who, in the conditions of labour organization today, contemplates available labour as unaffected by its own special interests, proceeds on a false assumption; he is familiar with the everyday refusal of union employees, for a variety of reasons, to enter upon work. The market of labour is, therefore, restricted by considerations of competing interests which are now part of the accepted modes of action of individuals and groups.\nDoes the exercise of those rights become illegal by declaring the reason for it or by stating the conditions necessary to a willingness to work, when that reason or those conditions relate to an existing contract? It would seem to be obvious that it does not. If, when a contractor has entered into an obligation of the sort here, individuals cannot ascribe to that fact their decision to remain as they are, then their freedom of contract is so far denied; and the statement of that reason in the circumstances of this case is not to be converted into an inducing offer to remove the objectionable fact.\nThe action of the respondents was not, therefore, either a procurement or an inducement of the breach which I will assume took place in Newell\u2019s contract; but by it the building contractor, having regard to the arrangement made by the Engineering Company and the Union, and the necessity for obtaining considerable labour for the remaining portion of the plumbing and heating work, facing on the one hand the contract and on the other the source of labour not open to him, was put to a choice of the side on which he considered his own interest to lie. It is, I think, the proper view to attribute the cancellation of the contract not to the refusal of labour by the respondents, but to the chosen course of action of the building contractor. The decision to abstain may have been the controlling influence upon him, but whether we attribute the rule to the balance of policy between these contending factors, or to the election on the part of the building contractor, the result is the same. If this were not so, by unitedly declining to associate themselves with non\u2011union workers, the respondents and their workmen would involve themselves in illegality brought about by the mere fact that the desire of the building contractor for their labour was stronger than that of observing the contract with Newell: by the offer of work made them, they became involved in the necessity of either accepting it with its objectionable conditions, or of avoiding collective refusal, or paying damages. To state that proposition in relation to the circumstances with which we are dealing is, I think, to answer it.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014The appellant\u2019s claim as pleaded was that the respondent Barker, who was at the relevant time the business agent of Local Union 67 of the United Association of Journeymen Plumbers and Steamfitters, and Bruce, the organizer for Canada of the said Union, had unlawfully and maliciously conspired and agreed with other members of the said Local Union to injure the appellant by unlawful means in the pursuit of his lawful trade and calling and to destroy his business as a master plumber and steamfitter. In particular it was alleged that by threats, coercion and intimidation practised by the respondents upon the W.H. Cooper Construction Company, Limited, and in consequence of a boycott instituted by the respondents and others unknown against the appellant, the said Company had broken a contract which it had entered into with the appellant, whereby the appellant suffered damage: alternatively, the appellant alleged that the respondents with others unknown had \u201cunlawfully and knowingly procured the W.H. Cooper Construction Company, Limited, to commit a breach of its contract with the plaintiff.\u201d While, in addition, the appellant alleged that the respondents operating through the Union had instituted and pursued a system of boycott against the plaintiff, allegations which apparently refer to matters other than the alleged loss of the Cooper contract, this claim was not pursued. Accepting the finding of the learned trial judge that there was a concluded oral agreement made by the appellant with the Cooper Company it is not denied that after this had been done Cooper informed the appellant that it was necessary that he should employ Union labour for the work and he agreed to do this. I agree with Laidlaw J.A., that this undertaking on the part of the appellant became a condition of his contract with the Cooper Company, failure to comply with which would relieve that company of its obligations under the agreement. Upon conflicting evidence the learned trial judge has found that the statement made by the respondent Bruce to Cooper was \u201cI can\u2019t stop you from carrying on with Mr. Newell\u2019s contract at all but you realize that if Mr. Newell carries on with this work that I cannot give Al Davis all the men he will require for this process piping.\u201d Davis was an official of the H.K. Ferguson Company of Cleveland, a concern which had the principal contract for the work. This company had given a subcontract to the Cooper Company for part of the work only, the Ferguson Company proposing itself to do a major part of the work including the equipment and process piping, which would require the employment of men of similar qualifications to those employed by the appellant. Apart from any question as to whether a contract between the Ferguson Company and the International Union obligating the former to employ only Union men upon any of its undertakings was in strictness proven, the evidence showed that the members of the Union were by the terms of its constitution forbidden to work with non\u2011Union men and that the Ferguson Company recognized that it was obligated to permit only Union men to work upon the job. It thus appears that Bruce\u2019s statement to Cooper was merely a statement of fact. Unless it would be an actionable wrong on the part of the plumbers and steamfitters, members of the Union, as between themselves and the appellant to decline to work with non-Union men, and it is quite clear that it would not, to state that they would so decline cannot be actionable at the suit of the appellant.\nWhen the appellant found that he was unable to comply with the condition of his contract with the Cooper Com- pany that only Union men would be employed upon the work, he agreed, at the request of that company, to the cancellation of his contract and to release it of any obligation. There was in fact no breach of contract by the Cooper Company, as alleged in the pleadings.\nHad the claim been based upon a contention that by some unlawful act of the respondents the appellant had been disabled from carrying out his obligations, it would also, in my opinion, fail. The learned trial judge has found that there was no evidence of conspiracy or of anything unlawful in the acts of the respondents and it has been found in the Court of Appeal that it was not proven that the failure of the appellant to reach an agreement with Local Union 67, or to obtain the benefit of any agreement between that Union and the Master Plumbers\u2019 Association, was caused by any act on the part of the respondents. I agree with these conclusions.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Morris & Morris.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Roebuck, Bagwell, McFarlane and Walkinshaw.\n[1] [1949] O.R. 85; [1949] 1 D.L.R. 544.\n[2] [1948] O.W.N. 625; [1948] 4 D.L.R. 64.\n[3] [1909] 1 K.B. 310.\n[4] [1915] A.C. 814.\n[5] (1919) 59 Can.

The action was dismissed. On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that court while agreeing with the trial judge that so far as the document sued on gave the respondents a right of indemnity the action was premature, held that the covenant to relieve the respondents from their guarantee within sixty days was a binding agreement in no way contingent upon their first being indemnified, and granted an order for specific performance.\nHeld: (Affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario). Taschereau and Locke JJ. dissenting in part, that a right was conferred upon the respondents under the covenant to be relieved from their guarantee within the sixty days specified which was in no way contingent upon their first being indemnified under the terms of the guarantee. There was a binding agreement and the appellant was in breach of it. The agreement is more than \u201cto guarantee in your stead\u201d as it reads \u201cto relieve you from your guarantee within 60 days from date\u201d. This covenant might be implemented in various ways, and the parties may well have had in mind that the appellant would desire to pay the debt guaranteed by the respondents, which would constitute performance of his obligation. Any award of damages would be too conjectural: Adderley v. Dixon, 1 S. & S., 607; and in any event would not be adequate.\nThe respondents have done all that was required of them and the appellant failed to establish that the provisions of the order were beyond the powers of the court and not proper under all the circumstances.\nTaschereau and Locke JJ., while otherwise concurring with the majority of the Court, dissented as to the court\u2019s power to grant specific performance.\nPer: Taschereau and Locke JJ., dissenting in part:\u2014The judgment of the Court of Appeal can only be construed as a direction to the appellant to pay off the bank. So construed it conflicts with the principle that specific performance is not granted of a covenant to pay money to a third person, the covenantee being left to his remedy in damages. Hall v. Hardy, 3 P. Wms. 187; Crampton v. Varna Ry. Co., 7 Ch. 562; Atty.-Gen. v. MacDonald, 6 Man. R. 545; Lloyd v. Dimmack, 7 Ch. D. 398; Ascherson v. Tredegar, 2 Ch. 401.\nAs to the alternative direction that in default of such payment security be given even if such direction could be supported, there is no warrant for it since the respondents, being apparently satisfied with the appellant\u2019s personal covenant, are entitled to nothing more. Antrobus v. Davidson, 3 Mer. 569; Brough v. Oddy, 1 Russ. & My. 55; The King v. Malcott, 9 Hare 592; Hughes Hallett v. Indian Mammoth Gold Mines, 22 Ch. D. 561.\nFor the judgment entered by the Court of Appeal an order should be substituted declaring the appellant bound to indemnify the respondents from liability under their guarantee but otherwise dismissing the claim, without prejudice to the rights of the respondents to bring such further action as they may be advised if there is default thereafter. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing the judgment of Wilson J., dismissing the action of the plaintiffs respondents.\nJ.W. Pickup K.C. and W.B. Williston for the appellant.\nJoseph Sedgewick K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice, Kerwin and Estey, JJ. was delivered by:\nKERWIN J.: The defendant, Gray, appeals against a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing the judgment of Wilson J., at the trial, which had dismissed the action of the plaintiffs respondents, Cameron, Ainsworth and Armstrong. The action was brought for specific performance of an agreement dated July 25, 1945, or, in the alternative, for damages in the sum of $25,000 and accrued interest and for further and other relief. The agreement reads as follows:\u2014\nTo\nMessrs. J.D. Cameron, L. Ainsworth and Henry Armstrong\nFor valuable consideration, which I hereby acknowledge to have received from you I hereby covenant to (sic) agree with you to guarantee, in your stead, the debt of Ontario Phosphate Industries Limited to the Royal Bank of Canada, Twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) in amount and further to indemnify and save you harmless against any claim against you whatsoever arising out of your guarantee of the said debt, and to relieve you from your guarantee within sixty days from date.\nDated at Toronto this 25th day of July, 1945.\nThe Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge that so far as the document gave the respondents a right of indemnity, the action was premature since the damages against which indemnity was provided had not accrued. However, fixing upon the words \u201cI hereby covenant * * * to relieve you from your guarantee within sixty days from date\u201d, the Court of Appeal decided that a right was thereby conferred upon the respondents which was in no way contingent upon their first being indemnified under the terms of the guarantee referred to. With that decision I am in complete agreement. The argument that there was no binding agreement is satisfactorily disposed of by Mr. Justice Roach and nothing, I think, may be usefully added to his reasons upon that point.\nHaving concluded that there was a binding agreement and that the appellant was in breach of it, the Court of Appeal made an order which has been vigorously attacked by counsel for the appellant as being unauthorized. It is pointed out in the reasons for judgment in the Court below that no case precisely in point has been found, and counsel have been unable to refer us to any. To a Court of Equity that is no insurmountable objection.\nThere is no doubt as to the rule that, generally speaking, performance will not be granted of a mere agreement to loan money or to pay money to a third party. Here, however, the agreement is more than \u201cto guarantee in your stead\u201d as it reads \u201cto relieve you from your guarantee within 60 days from date\u201d. This covenant might be implemented in various ways, and the parties may well have had in mind that the appellant would desire to pay the debt guaranteed by the respondents, which would constitute performance of his obligation. It is an unusual contract and any award of damages to the respondents would be too conjectural: Adderley v. Dixon[2]; and in any event would not be adequate. The terms of the order made by the Court of Appeal are lengthy but are necessarily so in view of the case and of the position in which the respondents find themselves as a result of the appellant\u2019s failure to fulfil his part of the bargain. The respondents have done all that was required of them and counsel for the appellant has been unable to satisfy me that the provisions of that order are beyond the powers of the Court and that they are not proper under all the circumstances. The ordering of the appellant to repay the respondents such sums as they have paid since the issue of the writ is merely a detail that a Court possessing equitable jurisdiction is entitled to cover in the working out of the rights and obligations of the parties.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Locke, JJ. was delivered by:\nLOCKE J.:\u2014By a guarantee in writing dated October 26, 1944, the respondents and one Ian Armour jointly and severally guaranteed payment to the Royal Bank of Canada of the liability which Ontario Phosphate Industries Limited had incurred or might incur to the bank up to the sum of $25,000 with interest from the date of demand for payment at the rate of five per centum per annum. It was alleged in the statement of claim that on October 28, 1944, the above mentioned company borrowed from the bank the sum of $25,000 upon a demand note endorsed by the plaintiffs and that the defendant, by an instrument dated July 25, 1945, had agreed with the respondents to guarantee that debt in their place and stead, to indemnify them against obligation upon their guarantee, and to relieve them of liability thereunder. It was not alleged that the bank had made any demand for payment or that the plaintiffs had paid anything on account of their liability as endorsers of the note. The relief claimed in the action was specific performance of the last mentioned agreement and, in the alternative, damages in the sum of $25,000 and accrued interest to the date of the trial. The statement of defence denied that there was any concluded agreement between the parties, denied that the plaintiffs had suffered any damage and alleged that they had not paid the bank and that the principal debtor was in existence and might pay the bank and contended that the claim was not properly the subject of a mandatory injunction.\nBy the agreement of July 25, 1945, the appellant agreed with the respondents to guarantee in their stead the debt of the company to the bank \u201cand further to indemnify and save you harmless against any claim against you whatsoever arising out of your guarantee of the said debt and to relieve you from your guarantee within sixty days from date.\u201d The evidence did not prove that any demand for payment of either principal or interest had been made by the bank upon the respondents prior to the commencement of the action, nor had they paid anything to the bank. The evidence of the bank manager disclosed that, at least in so far as he was concerned, the guarantee of Gray had never been considered as a substitute for the guarantee of the respondents and of Cameron and that the only way the guarantors would have been relieved was by payment in full of the note. Some payments on account of interest had been made by each of the guarantors but this was some months after the commencement of the action. The learned trial judge, considering that it was impossible to order the bank to accept the appellant\u2019s guarantee m lieu of that of the respondents, held that the agreement was impossible of performance and, in so far as the claim was for indemnity he considered it to be premature. As to damages, he found that there was no evidence and dismissed the action without prejudice to whatever claim the respondents might thereafter see fit to advance \u201cin regard to what they alleged to be the agreement between the parties.\u201d In the Court of Appeal Mr. Justice Roach, delivering the judgment of the Court, found that there was a binding agreement between the parties obligating the present appellant to discharge the obligations referred to in the agreement of July 25, 1945, and, while holding the claim in so far as it was one for indemnity to be premature, decreed specific performance of that part of the agreement whereby the appellant had undertaken to relieve the respondents from their guarantee within sixty days from its date. The formal judgment of the Court declared that the document sued upon was binding on the appellant, directed that he pay to each of the respondents the amount which they had paid respectively to the Royal Bank and required the appellant within thirty days:\nto cause the appellants (the present respondents) to be relieved from their guarantee to the bank and in default thereof ordering that the respondent shall either\n(a) pay into Court in this action an amount equal to the balance unpaid to the bank, or\n(b) deposit with the Accountant of the Supreme Court securities in such form and in such amounts as shall be adequate for the protection of the appellants against all liability under their guarantee to the bank;\nIf the parties cannot agree on the amount unpaid to the bank or if they cannot agree on the form or the adequacy of any securities proffered by the respondent pursuant to this judgment, then there shall be a reference to the Master to ascertain the amount or determine the form and adequacy of the securities as the case may be.\nIf at any time, or from time to time while the liability of the appellants on their guarantee remains undischarged, the bank shall demand payment from them of any sum or sums on account thereof, they shall be entitled to move before the Master, on notice to the respondent, for payment out to them from the money in Court of an amount equal to the amount demanded by the bank or for delivery to them of securities having then a value in the open market equal in amount to the amount demanded by the bank, and the same shall be used by the appellants in satisfying such demand of the bank.\nIf the liability of the appellants on their guarantee shall have been discharged wholly or in part otherwise than by payment by the appellants, leave is reserved to the respondent to move before the Master, on notice to the appellants, for payment out to him of an appropriate part or the whole of the money then on deposit with the Accountant or for re-delivery to him of an appropriate part of the securities which shall have been deposited by him in lieu of money.\nI agree with the conclusion of the judgment of the Court of Appeal that the agreement of July 25, 1945, became and remains binding upon the appellant. The point to be determined is, in my opinion, whether or not specific performance may be granted of such an agreement.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal, as will be noted, requires the appellant to cause the respondents to be relieved from their guarantee to the bank and this, of necessity, would involve either arranging with the bank to accept the obligation of the appellant in lieu of that of the respondents, or to pay the promissory note. If the first is the meaning ascribed to the language of the undertaking, the claim was obviously not one which could be the subject of an action for a specific performance since this would involve requiring the appellant to make an arrangement with the bank, and that institution was not a party to the action and might refuse to make any such arrangement. A court of equity will not make a decree which cannot be enforced. If the proper construction was that the appellant thereby obligated himself to pay off the debt owing by the company to the bank, it was a covenant by the appellant to pay money to a third person, an obligation in respect of which (with certain exceptions to be hereafter noted) specific performance is not granted, the obligee being left to his remedy at law. Before considering this aspect of the matter, it is to be noted that in so far as the claim advanced in the pleadings may be construed as a claim for indemnity, it was clearly premature since no demand was alleged to have been made, nor was any proven to have been made by the bank upon the respondents prior to the institution of the action and they had paid nothing to the bank prior to that time. The claim, it should be further noted, was not for a declaration that the appellant was liable to indemnify the respondents, nor were the proceedings in the nature of an action quia timet.\nIt must be assumed that it was not intended by the judgment of the Court of Appeal to direct the appellant to make arrangements with one not a party to the action to accept his guarantee in lieu of the respondents. Since the only possible alternative is to pay off the bank, the judgment must, in my opinion, be interpreted as an order directing the appellant to do so. In 31 Hals. (2nd Ed.) at 329, it is said that:\u2014\nThe remedy (of specific performance) is special and extraordinary in its character, and the Court has a discretion to grant it, or to leave the parties to their rights at law. The discretion of a Court exercising equitable jurisdiction is, however, not an arbitrary or capricious discretion; it is a discretion to be exercised on fixed principles in accordance with the previous authorities. It is not simply a question of what the individual judge thinks is fair or reasonable; the exercise of his discretion must be judicial.\nwhich, in my opinion, accurately expresses the law. The ground of the jurisdiction is the inadequacy of the remedy at law and, where damages will give a party the full compensation to which he is entitled and will put him in a position as beneficial to him as if the agreement had been specifically performed, equity will not interfere. As long ago as 1733 in Hall v. Hardy[3], in a note to the decision of Sir Joseph Jekyll, M.R., where upon the special facts specific performance of an award was decreed, it is said:\nThese decrees may not have been usual, because awards are commonly to pay money; in which cases a bill in equity to compel a performance is improper.\nThis statement of the law has been applied to contracts to pay money and consistently followed: Crampton v. Varna Co.[4], Lord Hatherley, L.C. at 567; Attorney-General v. MacDonald[5], Taylor C.J., at 375 and Killam J. at 378; Belgo-Canadian Real Estate Co. v. Allan[6], Fullerton J.A. at 560; 31 Hals. (2nd Ed.) 408. Specific performance is not granted of an agreement to loan money (South African Territories v. Wallington[7]); the remedy is in damages (General Securities v. Don Ingram, Ltd.[8]). There is, however, an exception in the case of the claims of sureties who may upon payment of the guaranteed debt being demanded of them obtain a decree of specific performance directing the principal debtor to pay it, and the jurisdiction is also exercised in certain circumstances as between co-sureties. The leading cases illustrating the application of the principle in proceedings such as these are Ranelaugh v. Hayes[9], Lloyd v. Dimmack[10]; Hughes-Hallett v. Indian Mammoth Gold Mines Co.[11]; Ascherson v. Tredegar[12]. These cases were brought against the principal debtor by sureties but in Wooldridge v. Norris[13], a surety on a bond to secure a money debt was secured by another bond of indemnity entered into by the principal debtor\u2019s father who had died having by will devised certain properties specifically upon trust to pay the debt, and it was held that the surety, though he had not actually paid anything, was entitled to maintain a bill quia timet against the executors for administration, payment of the debt and of an indemnity. Sir G.M. Giffard, V.C. found that the plaintiff was entitled to file the bill on the principle that a court of equity will prevent injury in proper cases before any actual injury has been suffered, by proceedings quia timet, in analogy to proceedings at common law where in some cases a writ may be maintained before any molestation or distress. In Wolmershausen v. Gullick[14], at 525, Wright J. refers to this decision as proceeding on the particular terms of the covenant. Wooldridge\u2019s case is, in some respects, similar to the present where the appellant has agreed to relieve the respondents from their liability within a fixed period and might conceivably justify an action quia timet if there had been any circumstances present and alleged in the pleadings justifying the intervention of the court to prevent loss; but there is neither one nor the other here.\nIn my opinion, the judgment in this case, construing it as I do as a direction to the appellant to pay a sum of money to the Royal Bank, not being in a proceeding between surety and principal debtor or between co-sureties or in proceedings taken quia timet, conflicts with the long established principle that specific performance is not granted of a contract to pay money to a third person. As to the alternative direction that, in default of such payment, security is to be given either by paying money into or depositing securities in court, there is, in my opinion, no warrant, even if the judgment directing the payment could be supported. The respondents in entering into the agreement with the appellant did not require from him any security that he would discharge his obligation. They were apparently satisfied with his personal covenant and I am unable to preceive upon what ground a court is justified in directing that he give security for its performance. In Antrobus v. Davidson[15], the colonel of a regiment had taken a bond of indemnity from his agents with another as surety in respect of all charges to which he might become liable by their default: the agent having afterwards become bankrupt and the government having given notice to the representatives of the colonel (who had died) of a demand upon his estate by virtue of an unliquidated account, a bill by such representatives against the representatives of the surety to pay the balance due to the government and also to set aside a sufficient sum out of their testator\u2019s estate to answer future contingent demands, though attempted to be supported upon the principle of a bill quia timet, was dismissed. The colonel had accepted the covenant of the surety and Grant, M.R. said in part:\u2014\nWhat is here asked is to have a new security and one of a totally different sort from that which Davidson (the surety) consented to give,\u2014a security by deposit of money instead of a security by personal obligation.\nIn Brough v. Oddy[16], where the defendant had entered into an agreement to pay a stipulated amount annually by quarterly payments in the event that they were not paid by the principal obligor, the plaintiff claimed payment of amounts due and security for the payment of amounts thereafter to fall due. Sir John Leach, M.R., after referring to the terms of the engagement, said that he was not aware of any case in which, where the contract created only a personal obligation, the Court had ordered a party to give a security on property for its due performance. In The King v. Malcott[17], a lessor claimed the administration of the estate of his lessee and to have a sufficient part of the assets impounded to answer future possible breaches of covenant in the lease, thus in effect asking for a decree of specific performance against the estate and the giving of security to ensure it. Sir G.J. Turner, V.C., dismissing the claim, said:\u2014\nWhy should the lessor have any such right as he claims in this case? How can it be the result of the relation between landlord and tenant? The landlord has not bargained with his tenant that the tenant\u2019s assets, or any fund whatever, should be impounded for the purpose of securing his rent or the due performance of his covenants. He looks to the personal security of the lessee or to the rights which he has expressly reserved to himself over the subject of the demise; and farther than that he cannot proceed at law. Why should a Court of Equity give a more extended effect to the obligation contracted between a landlord and tenant than is given by a court of law?\nIn Hughes Hallett v. Indian Mammoth Gold Mines supra, where a claim was made upon a contract of indemnity and security in respect of payments which might become due in the future, Fry, J. referring to Brough v. Oddy, supra said:\u2014\nIf the plaintiff was minded to accept the personal contract of Cookesley for indemnity, he must be content with that and I cannot possibly give him any better indemnity.\nThe respondents were apparently satisfied with the personal covenant of the appellant and are entitled, in my opinion, to nothing more.\nIt was shown that after the commencement of the action the respondents had paid to the Royal Bank certain sums for interest upon the note and judgment was given against the appellant for the amounts so paid. As to this, no such claim was advanced by the statement of claim and as the rights of the respondents must be determined as of the date of the commencement of the action this portion of the judgment cannot, in my opinion, be supported.\nWhile the statement of claim did not ask a declaration that the appellant was bound by the agreement of July 25, 1945, that issue has been fully argued upon what, I am satisfied, is all of the available evidence and, in the interests of all parties, should not be further litigated. For the judgment entered by the Court of Appeal I would substitute an order declaring the appellant to be bound to indemnify the respondents from liability under their guarantee but otherwise dismissing the claim, without prejudice to the right of the respondents to bring such further action or actions as they may be advised if there is default hereafter. If there is such default, the respondents will have their remedy in damages. The appellant should have his costs of this appeal and I think, since the respondents did not by their pleadings claim the only relief to which they are entitled, there should be no costs of the proceedings other than in this Court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fasken, Robertson, Aitchison, Pickup & Calvin.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Joseph Sedgwick.\n[1] Not yet reported.\n[2] (1824) 1 S. & S. 607.\n[3] (1733) 3 P.

C.L. Dubbin for the appellant and W.B. Common, K.C., and J.D. Bell for the Crown. On Feb. 7, 1950, the Court directed a re-hearing of argument in particular on the effect under Canadian Law of a Court of Appeal quashing a conviction without ordering a new trial. The re-hearing on March 27, 1950, was heard by the full bench. G.A. Martin, K.C., and C.L. Dubbin for the appellant and W.B. Common, K.C., for the respondent.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL OF ONTARIO.\nCriminal Law\u2014Appeals\u2014Autre fois acquit\u2014Autre fois convict\u2014Conviction for manslaughter on indictment for murder quashed for misdirection but new trial not ordered nor an acquittal directed\u2014Fresh indictment preferred by Crown for manslaughter\u2014Statutory authority given Court of Appeal to direct acquittal or a new trial, mandatory\u2014Failure of court to exercise such authority precludes another trial under s. 873\u2014The Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 86, ss. 856, 878, 905-909, 951, 1014 (3).\nThe Criminal Code provides:\n\u201cSection 1014 (3). Subject to the special provisions contained in the following sections of this Part, when the court of appeal allows an appeal against conviction it may\n(a) quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered; or\n(b) direct a new trial:\nand in either case may make such other order as justice requires.\u201d Held: By the majority of the court (Rinfret C.J., Kerwin and Taschereau JJ., dissenting), that the exercise of the statutory authority given to the court of appeal under s. 1014 (3) to direct an acquittal to be entered, or to direct a new trial, and in either case to make such other order as justice requires, is not permissive but mandatory. The right of appeal being such an exceptional right, all the substantive and procedural provisions relating to it must be regarded as exhaustive and exclusive and need not be expressly stated in the Statute. If therefore the court of appeal fails to exercise its authority and refrains from directing a new trial, another trial cannot be had by resorting to s. 873. The powers under that section are not absolute and cannot obtain in all circumstances. Like many others in the Code, they remain subject to qualifications and restrictions implicitly and necessarily flowing from other provisions in the same Act.\nPer Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau J., dissenting: The only competent authority in a case of misdirection to order a new trial is the Court of Appeal, but failure of that court to make such an order does not preclude the Crown from exercising its rights to prefer a fresh bill of indictment under s. 873. The proceedings under the fresh bill of indictment do not constitute a new trial, within the meaning of s. 1014, they initiate a second trial, entirely independent of the first on a new indictment. A \u201cnew trial\u201d which alone the court of appeal has the power to order in a criminal prosecution, is the re-examination of a case on the same information or indictment. It supposes a completed trial, which for some sufficient reason has ben set aside, so that the issues may be litigated de novo. It is ordered so that the court may have the opportunity to correct errors in the proceedings at the first trial. Such is not the case here, and unless there are valid reasons to prevent the Crown to initiate a second trial as it did, this appeal must fail. We have to decide if the incomplete judgment of the Court of Appeal, is a bar to the exercise by the Crown of its unquestionable power to prefer a bill of indictment. A solid ground of defence would undoubtedly be a plea of autre fois acquit or autre fois convict, but this cannot be successfully argued. The appellant has neither been acquitted nor convicted, and it is only in such cases that an accused may say, if he is brought to trial again on the same charge, that he has been in \u201cjeopardy\u201d twice. Rex v. Ecker and Fry, 64 O.L.R. 1 at 3. The law does not allow that a man be tried a second time when he has already been convicted, or exposed to be convicted, when he has already been acquitted, but it does not forbid a second trial when the first did not come to a legal conclusion. Only the pleas of autre fois acquit or autre fois convict could be successfully raised by the appellant in the present case, and as they both fail, the appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin J., dissenting: The power given to the Court of Appeal under s. 1014 (3) is permissive as indicated by the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d and includes the power to allow an appeal and set aside a conviction leaving the Crown free to prefer a new and different indictment, if it sees fit. The powers of the Court of Appeal are not circumscribed as are those of the Court of Criminal Appeal in England and the decisions of that Court are, therefore, of no assistance on the point under review. This appeal is to be decided under the provisions of the Criminal Code, Rex v. O\u2019Keefe, 15 N.S.W.L.R. 1; Rex v. Lee, 16 N.S.W.L.R. 6, distinguished; Rex v. Welch, [1948] O.R. 884, Rex. v. Pascal, 95 C.C.C. 288, approved. Gudmundson v. The King, 60 C.C.C., distinguished. Where an accused upon an indictment for murder is convicted of manslaughter a court of appeal may properly under s. 1014 (3) allow the appeal and set aside such conviction. If it neither directs a verdict of acquittal to be entered, nor directs a new trial, s. 873 (1) is then wide enough to permit the preferring of a bill of indictment for manslaughter. In provinces where there is no grand jury, subsequent sub\u2011sections of s. 873 takes care of the situation. The second ground of the appeal, that, \u201cthe accused was entitled in answer to the present indictment to the common law defence that a man should not be put twice in jeopardy for the same matter,\u201d\u2014is not a plea or defence, as the plea of autre fois acquit is grounded on the maxim, that a man shall not be brought into danger of his life for one and the same offence, more than once. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown, 8th Ed. Vol. II, c. 35, s. 1. As to the 3rd and 4th grounds of appeal\u2014(a) \u201cs. 902 (2) was a bar to the present indictment;\u201d (b) \u201cthe accused was entitled to succeed on his plea of autre fois acquit pursuant to s. 907.\u201d\u2014The meaning of s. 907, may be gathered from the use of the word \u201clawfully\u201d in s. 906 (3), this expresses what has been well understood for many years viz. that the defence of autre fois acquit applies only where the first trial has been concluded by an adjudication: Reg. v. Charlesworth, 121 E.R. 786; Rex v. Ecker, 64 O.L.R. 1. Here, the only adjudication was against the accused for manslaughter and that adjudication was merely set aside by the first order of the Court of Appeal. As to the first leg of s. 909 (2) \u201ca previous conviction or acquittal on an indictment for murder shall be a bar to a second indictment for the same homicide charging it as manslaughter\u201d. This must mean a previous general conviction or acquittal.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing the appellant\u2019s appeal from a conviction by a judge and jury for manslaughter. The appellant had previously been indicted for murder and convicted of manslaughter, but the conviction was quashed on appeal.[2]\nG.A. Martin, K.C., and C.L. Dubbin, for the appellant.\nW.B. Common, K.C., and J.D. Bell, for the respondent.\nThe dissenting judgment of the Chief Justice and Taschereau J. was delivered by:\u2014\nTASCHEREAU J.:\u2014The accused appellant was charged with the murder of his wife and his trial took place at the City of St. Thomas in the County of Elgin, in March, 1949. He was acquitted of the charge of murder but convicted of manslaughter. The Court of Appeal of the Province of Ontario allowed the appeal, and set aside the conviction for manslaughter on the ground of misdirection by the trial judge. The Court however, did not direct a new trial, but in their reasons for judgment, Laidlaw and Hogg JJ. both made the emphatic statement that the accused was not acquitted. Mr. Justice Henderson, who also heard the case, was of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nThe reason for not ordering a new trial is that on a count charging murder, no count charging any other offence may be joined. (Cr. Code, sec. 856). The contention is that if the Court of Appeal had ordered a new trial, although manslaughter is an included offence in a count of murder, the accused would have had to face a second time an indictment charging murder, an offence of which he had previously been acquitted. (Cr. Code 951, para. 2). Vide: (Rex v. McDonald,[3]; Rex v. Anthony,[4]; Rex v. Pascal,[5], Part XX, 849).\nA new indictment charging manslaughter was therefore preferred by the Crown, and before Mr. Justice Schroeder and the jury, the appellant pleaded \u201cautrefois acquit\u201d, submitting that the Order of the Court of Appeal which did not direct a new trial, had the effect of an acquittal. A jury having been sworn dismissed this contention of the appellant following in this, the direction of the trial judge. The jury then found the accused guilty of manslaughter and he was sentenced to 10 years in penitentiary. The Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed his appeal.\nIt is now submitted before this Court that the accused, having once before been tried for murder arising out of the same homicide, and convicted of manslaughter, could not again be tried for manslaughter, because that conviction had been set aside by the Court of Appeal, which did not direct a new trial. It is claimed that he cannot be put twice in \u201cjeopardy\u201d for the same matter, and that, under the provisions of section 909, para. 2, his first acquittal on the indictment for murder, is a bar to a second indictment for the same homicide charging it as manslaughter.\nIt is an elementary principle of criminal law that when an accused charged of a crime has been convicted or acquitted by a jury, he cannot be charged a second time for the same crime, and it is also clear that if on a charge of murder, an accused is acquitted and not found guilty of manslaughter, he cannot foe charged of manslaughter, because under the provisions of section 907, para. 2, Cr. Code, the accused might on the former trial have been convicted of manslaughter, and this is obviously a bar to a new charge of manslaughter.\nBut in the present case, the accused was acquitted of murder and found guilty of manslaughter, and the Court of Appeal, although it found that there had been misdirection, did not acquit the appellant. The Order of the Court was that the trial was not a fair one, but the reasons of Laidlaw and Hogg JJ. clearly indicate that the accused was not acquitted. The majority of the Court thought that a new trial could not be ordered, but left it to the Crown to take the proper steps, if found opportune, to bring the accused before the courts once more.\nI had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of my brother Fauteux, and I agree with him, that when the Court of Appeal allows an appeal against a conviction, in a case like the one at bar, it has only two alternatives. It may quash the conviction and direct a verdict of acquittal, or direct a new trial, and it is only when one of these two courses has been followed that it may make such other order as justice requires. It is however imperative and not only permissive, that there should be an acquittal or that a new trial should be directed.\nI entertain no doubt that the Court of Appeal had power by virtue of section 1014 (3) of the Cr. C., after having quashed the conviction, to direct a new trial limited exclusively to the charge of manslaughter. This would have clearly been an order authorized by the concluding part of section 1014 (3) Cr. C.\nBut the Court of Appeal did not give such an order, with the result, that the accused has neither been acquitted nor convicted, and as there was no jurisdiction upon this Court to apply the proper remedy, it necessarily follows that for all practical purposes the first indictment cannot be acted upon any further. These proceedings have come to an end, as there can be found nothing in the law to authorize the revival of this first trial. I fully concur in the view expressed that the only competent authority, in a case of misdirection, to order a new trial is the Court of Appeal, but I do not agree that the failure by the court to make such an order had the effect of precluding the Crown from exercising its rights to prefer a fresh bill of indictment under 873 Cr. C. as it has been done in the present case.\nThe proceedings under the fresh bill of indictment do not constitute a new trial, within the meaning of section 1014; they initiated a second trial, entirely independent of the first, on a new indictment. \u201cA new trial\u201d which alone the Court of Appeal has the power to order in a criminal prosecution, is the re-examination of a case on the same information or indictment. It supposes a completed trial, which for some sufficient reason has been set aside, so that the issues may be litigated de novo. It is ordered so that the court may have an opportunity to correct errors in the proceedings at the first trial.\nBut such is not the case here, and unless there are valid reasons to prevent the Crown to initiate a second trial as it did, this appeal must fail. We have to decide if the incomplete judgment given by the Court of Appeal, is a bar to the exercising by the Crown of its unquestionable power to prefer a bill of indictment.\nA solid ground of defence would undoubtedly be a plea of \u201cautrefois acquit\u201d or \u201cautrefois convict\u201d, but I am satisfied that this cannot be successfully argued. The appellant has neither been acquitted nor convicted, and it is only in such cases that an accused may say, if he is brought to trial again on the same charge, that he has been in \u201cjeopardy\u201d twice. As Chief Justice Latchford said in Rex v. Ecker and Fry[6] (at page 3):\u2014\nThis Court was of the opinion that \u201cin jeopardy twice\u201d\u2014the bis vexari of the legal maxim\u2014has not the meaning of subjection twice to a trial for the same offence except in cases where the first trial has been concluded by an adjudication or judgment declaring the accused acquitted or convicted. Not otherwise could the plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict prevail.\nI fully agree with this statement of the law, and I may add that there are a great number of cases, where accused have undergone second trials, when it was established that the plea of \u201cautrefois acquit\u201d or \u201cautrefois convict\u201d could not be successfully raised. The law does not allow that a man be tried a second time when he has already been convicted, or exposed to be convicted, when he has already been legally acquitted, but it does not forbid a second trial when the first did not come to a legal conclusion.\nOnly the pleas of \u201cautrefois acquit\u201d or \u201cautrefois convict\u201d could be successfully raised by the appellant in the present case, and as they both fail, the appeal should be dismissed.\nKERWIN J., dissenting:\u2014By leave granted under subsection 1 of section 1025 of the Criminal Code as enacted by section 42 of chapter 39 of the Statutes of 1948, the accused, Welch, appeals against a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing his appeal against his conviction for manslaughter. He had been previously convicted of manslaughter after his; trial upon an indictment for murder, arising from the death of the same person. The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal against that conviction on the ground of misdirection of the jury by the trial judge. The terms of that order and the reasons therefor are succinctly set forth in the following extract from the reasons of the Chief Justice of Ontario for the decision now appealed against:\u2014\nIn his reasons for judgment in disposing of the appeal, Mr. Justice Laidlaw, referring to the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty of manslaughter, said \u201cThat verdict, having been reached after such misdirection, is not a valid conviction and must be set aside. At the same time, I make it clear that the accused has not been acquitted of the offence of manslaughter and I express no opinion as to what further proceedings the Crown can or ought to take against the appellant in the particular circumstances.\u201d Mr. Justice Hogg, who concurred in setting aside the conviction said \u201cI agree with the observations made by my brother Laidlaw that the appellant has not been acquitted of the crime of manslaughter.\u201d Mr. Justice Henderson, who, with Mr. Justice Laidlaw and Hogg, made up the Court that heard the appeal, was of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. The formal certificate of the Court\u2019s order, after a recital, was in these words, \u201cThis Court did order that the said appeal should be and the same was allowed and that the said conviction should be and the same was vacated and set aside.\u201d\nA new indictment charging manslaughter was preferred and upon his arraignment the accused pleaded autrefois acquit. On the trial of that issue, the jury on the judge\u2019s instruction found against the accused. He thereupon pleaded not guilty but was convicted and sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment. The appeal to the Court of Appeal followed, and, upon the affirmance of the conviction, leave to appeal was granted. The points upon which that leave was granted are set forth in the appellant\u2019s factum as follows:\u2014\n(a) The accused having once before been tried for murder, arising out of the same homicide, and convicted of manslaughter, and whose conviction had been set aside by the Court of Appeal, could not again be tried for manslaughter without a formal order of the Court of Appeal directing a new trial.\n(b) The accused was entitled in answer to the present indictment to the common law defence that a man should not be put twice in jeopardy for the same matter.\n(c) Section 909 (2) of the Criminal Code was a bar to the present indictment.\n(d) The accused was entitled to succeed on his plea of autrefois acquit pursuant to Section 907 of the Criminal Code.\nIt was argued that the Court of Appeal had no power merely to set aside the first conviction and that, therefore, its order must be taken to be an acquittal of manslaughter under the indictment for murder. That argument is based upon the provisions of subsection 3 of section 1014:\u2014\n3. Subject to the special provisions contained in the following sections of this Part, when the court of appeal allows an appeal against conviction it may\n(a) quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered; or\n(b) direct a new trial;\nand in either case may make such other order as justice requires.\nThe contention is that when the Court of Appeal allows an appeal against conviction it must either (1) formally allow the appeal; and (2) quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered; and (3) make such other order as justice requires; or (1) formally allow the appeal; and (2) direct a new trial; and (3) make such other order as justice requires. The argument amounts to a contention that if the Court merely allows an appeal and quashes the conviction, the case falls within the first alternative. To that argument I am unable to accede. While some plausibility is lent to it by the expression \u201cin either case\u201d, the power given to the Court of Appeal is permissive as is indicated by the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d and includes the power to allow an appeal and set aside a conviction leaving the Crown free to prefer a new and different indictment, if it sees fit. The powers of the Court of Appeal are not circumscribed as are those of the Court of Criminal Appeal in England and the decisions of that Court are, therefore, of no assistance on the point under review.\nOn the reargument of this appeal before the full Court, a discussion took place as to the powers exercised in England before 1904 of granting a writ of venire de novo and as to the powers of a Court of Error. I have considered these arguments and the practice and law prevailing as to each of these matters and particularly the two cases in New South Wales referred to, Rex v. O\u2019Keefe[7], and Rex v. Lee[8], but have been unable to gain any assistance from any of these in coming to a conclusion. This appeal is to be decided under the provisions of the Criminal Code.\nIn Rex v. Pascal[9], the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, by a majority, followed the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal on the first appeal by Welch to it[10]. Mr. Justice O\u2019Halloran dissented and came to the conclusion that the proper order to make in circumstances such as existed in that and the present case was for the Court of Appeal, after setting aside the conviction, to direct a new trial upon the charge of manslaughter, of which the accused had been convicted and which conviction was set aside by the Court of Appeal. That learned judge realized the difficulty in coming to that conclusion in view of the provisions of section 909 (2) of the Code and of the obstacle of arraigning an accused on the same indictment, but concluded that because of his view as to the meaning of 1014 (3), the Court of Appeal had the power to direct a new trial on the charge of manslaughter since, while by section 856, to a count in an indictment charging murder, no count charging any other offence shall be joined, 951 (2) provides:\u2014\n2. On a count charging murder, if the evidence proves manslaughter but does not prove murder, the jury may find the accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, but shall not on that count find the accused guilty of any other offence.\nWith respect I am unable to agree with Mr. Justice O\u2019Halloran\u2019s view of section 1014 (3) and in my opinion the proper course to follow is that adopted by the Ontario Court of Appeal and followed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal. Section 873 (1) is then wide enough to permit the preferring of a bill of indictment for manslaughter. In provinces where there is no grand jury, subsequent subsections of section 873 take care of the situation. It may be that in some cases, if an accused is charged with murder and convicted of manslaughter and this conviction is set aside, then, on a new indictment for manslaughter, the accused might be found by the second jury not guilty of manslaughter but guilty of some included offence. This, in my opinion, is not an objection either to what I deem is the proper construction of section 1014 (3) or to the possibility of the accused being found guilty of such included charge which would not have been possible under the first indictment for murder. That possibility does not alter my view as to the correct interpretation of section 1014 (3) nor, in the event of that occurring, would it place an accused in double jeopardy since, on the first indictment, he could not have been found guilty of such included charge.\nIt was also argued that what the Court of Appeal did was based upon its former decisions in Rex v. MacDonald[11], and Rex v. Antony[12], and that these are in conflict with the decision of this Court in Gudmondson v. The King[13]. As appears from an examination of the case and factums in that case, the accused had asked that his conviction be quashed and a new trial not ordered. This Court was not prepared to say that a verdict of acquittal should be entered and, as the point now under discussion was not argued or considered, the decision cannot be taken as being in conflict with the orders made by the Court of Appeal in the cases mentioned. Furthermore, a mere reading of the reasons for judgment on Welch\u2019s first appeal shows that the Court did not direct a verdict of acquittal. This disposes of the first ground of appeal.\nAs to the second ground, it is sufficient to point out that former jeopardy is not a plea or defence as the maxim nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa, or as it is sometimes expressed, nemo debet bis puniri pro uno delicto, is merely the basis for the plea of autrefois acquit. \u2018\u201cThe plea of autrefois acquit is grounded on this maxim, that a man shall not be brought into danger of his life for one and the same offence, more than once.\u201d Hawkins\u2019 Pleas of the Crown, 8th ed. vol. II, c. 35, s. 1.\nThe third and fourth grounds may be considered together. Sections 905 to 908 inclusive of the Code deal with the special pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict. The meaning and effect of section 907, referred to by the appellant, may be better gathered from the use of the word \u201clawfully\u201d in subsection 3 of section 906.\n3. In any plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict it shall be sufficient for the accused to state that he has been lawfully acquitted or convicted, as the case may be, of the offence charged in the count or counts to which such plea is pleaded, indicating the time and place of such acquittal, or conviction.\nThis expresses what has been well understood for many years, viz., that the defence of autrefois acquit applies only where the first trial has been concluded by an adjudication: Reg. v. Charlesworth[14], Rex v. Ecker[15]. Here, the only adjudication was against the accused for manslaughter and that adjudication was merely set aside by the first order of the Court of Appeal. Nor is the appellant assisted by the first leg of subsection 2 of section 909 upon which he relies:\u2014\nA previous conviction or acquittal on an indictment for murder shall be a bar to a second indictment for the same homicide charging it as manslaughter.\nThis must mean a previous general conviction or acquittal. The appellant does not, of course, contend that he was convicted and, as the Chief Justice of Ontario points out, the suggestion that he was acquitted is precisely the same contention advanced in support of the plea of autrefois acquit.\nThe appeal must be dismissed.\nThe judgment of Rand, Kellock, Estey, Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\u2014\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario (Robertson C.J.O., Laidlaw and Roach JJ.A.)[16] dismissing, on March 17, 1949, an appeal from the conviction of the appellant on a charge of manslaughter. The appellant had been previously tried on an indictment for murder, arising from the death of the same person. Upon this first trial, the jury brought in a verdict of manslaughter. An appeal from this conviction was allowed under section 1014, on the ground of misdirection. The formal certificate of the Court\u2019s order, after a recital, is in these words:\u2014\nThis Court did order that the said appeal should be and the same was allowed and that the said conviction should be and the same was vacated and set aside.\nIn his reasons for judgment, Laidlaw J.A., with reference to the jury\u2019s verdict of \u201cguilty of manslaughter\u201d said:\u2014\nThat verdict having been reached after such misdirection is not a valid conviction and must be set aside. At the same time, I make it clear that the accused has not been acquitted of the offence of manslaughter and I express no opinion as to what further proceedings the Crown can or ought to take against the appellant in the particular circumstances.\nConcurring in setting aside the conviction, Hogg J.A., said:\u2014\nI agree with the observations made by my brother Laidlaw that the appellant has not been acquitted of the crime of manslaughter.\nHenderson J.A., expressed the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nNo direction was then made by the Court of Appeal either to enter a judgment and verdict of acquittal or for a new trial. The Court of Appeal did not in either respect exercise its authority under section 1014 (3). Confronted with this situation, the Crown first moved to appeal this judgment to this Court but, for reasons of jurisdiction, leave was refused.\nIt was in these circumstances that a fresh bill of indictment charging the appellant with manslaughter was subsequently preferred by the Crown under the provisions of section 873 of the Criminal Code. A true bill was found by the grand jury, the appellant was brought to trial and, eventually, found guilty of the offence charged. His appeal against this conviction was unanimously dismissed by the judgment now before us for review.\nAs a new trial was not directed by the first judgment of the Court of Appeal, it is manifest that the sub stratum of jurisdiction for all the proceedings leading to the conviction of the appellant and eventually to the present appeal can stem only from this fresh bill of indictment preferred under section 873 in the circumstances above related. In the present instance, this question of jurisdiction is twofold. Once the appeal is allowed for misdirection and the conviction is quashed by the Court under section 1014, is the statutory authority vested in the Court of Appeal to direct a verdict of acquittal to be entered or to direct a new trial, mandatory or simply permissive? And if this authority is mandatory, can another trial,\u2014notwithstanding the express lack of direction for a new trial by the judicial body solely empowered to make it,\u2014be had by resorting to the provisions of section 873?\nDealing with the first point. The relevant provisions of section 1014 were enacted by Parliament in 1923 (13-14 George V, chap. 41, s. 9). They read:\u2014\n1014.\n3. Subject to the special provisions contained in the following sections of this Part, when the Court of appeal allows an appeal against conviction it may\n(a) quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered; or\n(b) direct a new trial;\nand in either case may make such other order as justice requires.\nThe corresponding section of the English Criminal Appeal Act of 1907 (7 Edward VII, c. 23, art. 4) from which the above were taken reads:\u2014\n4. (2) Subject to the special provisions of this Act, the Court of Criminal Appeal shall, if they allow an appeal against conviction, quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered.\nThe above juxtaposition of the two sets of provisions makes it clear that the differences between them, as well as the different manner in which each is set up, are attributable to the existence of an alternative course,\u2014a new trial,\u2014which our Courts only, in a proper case, must, as I propose to show, direct. That in the process of thus amending our law, the indented letter (a) has been misplaced before the words \u201cquash the conviction and\u201d, rather than being properly placed after them, cannot alter the true meaning and the only possible construction of the section. For it is clear that if the appeal against a conviction is allowed, of necessity the conviction must be quashed. No other purpose can be served by the allowance of the appeal. And it is then, and then only, that the occasion to exercise the further statutory authority related to the election between a verdict of acquittal or a new trial, may arise.\nThat there will be cases where the Court of Appeal will not order one or other of the alternatives is certain. Thus a conviction on an indictment signed by an unauthorized person cannot be sustained and must be quashed. And in such a case, an order, either directing a verdict of acquittal to be entered or a new trial, would be meaningless and senseless. It cannot, therefore, be stated that this further authority is given with respect to trials affected with such complete and fatal nullity. On that point, our law is not at variance with the law in England even if, in the relevant provisions of the latter, the word \u201cshall\u201d and not the word \u201cmay\u201d is used to govern the construction of the statutory power (Crane v. Director of Public Prosecutions[17], Brodie v. Rex[18].) In like cases, the accused, having never been in peril of conviction, could not subsequently if and when validly indicted, plead autrefois acquit on the occasion of a trial which, if truly the second in fact, would be the first in law.\nHowever, in a case where the appeal is allowed on ground of misdirection and the conviction is quashed, then necessarily arises the occasion to exercise the further statutory authority. In England, the Court of Appeal, having no power to direct a new trial, \u201cshall\u201d then direct a verdict of acquittal to be entered,\u2014\u201deven though the prisoner be clearly guilty\u201d.\u2014(Kenny, Outlines of Criminal Law, 13th Ed., foot note page 500). In Canada, the Court of Appeal must equally exercise the further statutory power and order, either a verdict of acquittal to be entered, or direct a new trial. For, until such an order is made, there is still pending before the Court of Appeal a valid indictment upon which there is no final adjudication. And the very procedure to that end is provided for. The accused, for one, has, in such circumstances and under our law, a clear and unimpeachable right to such judicial pronouncement with respect to the election between two courses,\u2014one of which resulting in his acquittal,\u2014on the sole and very basis of the case as then under review and that, according to well established principles. The expression \u201cmay\u201d related to this further authority of the Court is not and cannot, in the context of the section read in the light of paramount principles of our criminal procedure, be permissive. It is mandatory. In M\u2019Dougall v. Patterson[19], it was held that\n* * * when a statute confers an authority to do a judicial act in a certain case, it is imperative on those so authorized to exercise the authority, when the case arises and its exercise is duly applied for by a party interested, and having the right to make the application. For this reason, we are of the opinion that the word \u201cmay\u201d is not used to give a discretion but to confer a power upon the Court and Judges and that the exercise of such power depends, not upon the discretion of the Court or Judges, but upon the proof of the particular case out of which such power arises.\nThat a like reasoning and meaning is to obtain with respect to the same word \u201cmay\u201d in the last member of this section clearly stems from the context \u201cand in either case may make such order as justice requires\u201d. For new and extraordinary would be a rule of construction stating that, being empowered to make an order required by justice, a Court of justice would be free to refrain from making it when the occasion to do so arises. In Reg. v. Bishop of Oxford[20], it was held that\nso long ago as the year 1693 it was decided in the case of R. v. Barlow[21], that when a statute authorizes the doing of a thing for the sake of justice or the public good, the word \u201cmay\u201d means \u201cshall\u201d and that rule has been acted upon to the present time * * * .\u201d\nWith like powers, or rather duties, I fail, I must say with deference, to appreciate the alleged obstacles standing in the way of the Court of Appeal to exercise its authority if, as suggested, the majority judges wanted to direct a new trial only on this sole undisposed of part of the indictment, that is, the lesser charge of manslaughter. Legal and sufficient it would have been to direct a new trial on the offence of manslaughter exclusively and to further order that the original indictment of murder be, to that end, amended. Thus, on this new trial, the accused could only be found guilty or not guilty of manslaughter. The language of the statute is broad enough to embrace the authority to make such \u201cother order\u201d, if the justice of the case suggests no other. And I know of no principles of law which could have then been violated by such order. I must, therefore, conclude that the exercise of the statutory authority given to the Court of Appeal, under section 1014 (3), to direct an acquittal to be entered or to direct a new trial and in either case, to make such other order as justice requires, is not permissive but mandatory.\nDealing with the second point, the Court having failed to exercise its authority in the first appeal and having refrained from directing a new trial by a judgment which, though substantially incomplete, remains undisturbed, could another trial be had by resorting to section 873?\nIt cannot be disputed that, had either one of the courses, which the Court of Appeal was bound to direct, been directed, this fresh bill of indictment would never have been preferred in fact. And never then could, in law, a fresh bill of indictment be authorized under section 873. For on the one hand, the entry of a verdict of acquittal by the Court of Appeal would have brought the case to an end.\nOn the other hand, had the Court of Appeal directed a new trial, a fresh bill of indictment could no more, in law, have been preferred. For such a course would have subjected the order of the Court to the finding of a true bill by a grand jury. On a new trial being ordered, the accused is not even required to plead. The trial proceeds immediately on the original or amended indictment.\nThese considerations suffice to indicate that, general and unrestricted as they may appear, the powers under section 873 are not absolute and cannot obtain in all circumstances. Like many others in the Code, they remain subject to qualifications and restrictions implicitly and necessarily flowing from other provisions in the same Act.\nAgain, the relevant provisions of section 873 were enacted much before those of section 1014 (3) and then, not in relation to the latter. It cannot be contended, therefore, that they were meant, when enacted, to provide a mode of redress,\u2014left, furthermore, at the discretion of the Attorney General or of the trial Judge,\u2014against the failure of a Court of Appeal,\u2014a higher authority,\u2014to comply with the imperative provisions of section 1014 (3).\nOur criminal law clearly prescribes two methods leading to the holding of a trial. One is by way of an information or complaint and the other is by way (in the province of Ontario) of a preferred bill of indictment. There are no other methods.\nWhatever be the method adopted if on a valid indictment, the trial proceeds, with no defect as to jurisdiction, to verdict and judgment, then the procedure provided by the law for the trial of that issue,\u2014or included issues,\u2014is exhausted and the trial is brought to an end, unless there is an appeal. The legislature does not, in addition to the above procedure, contemplate or authorize,\u2014either by laying another information or complaint, or preferring another bill of indictment under 873,\u2014such a thing as the actual holding of another trial on the same issue, or included issues, parallel to or independently of the first trial and irrespective of the juridical consequences developing and rights accruing thereby to either of the parties, according to law in the course of the latter. For such duplication would, to say the least, render one course futile. So if a trial has been had following the laying of an information, the provisions of section 873 could have no application with respect to the issue, or included issues, therein.\nIf, the case being concluded in first instance, there is an appeal, for the same reason, like duplication of the procedure cannot obtain. And the matter must, from then on, be considered in the light only of the provisions relating to the appeal.\nThe right of appeal is an exceptional right. That all the substantive and procedural provisions relating to it must be regarded as exhaustive and exclusive, need not be expressly stated in the statute. That necessarily flows from the exceptional nature of the right.\nIn Craies, on Statute Law, 4th Edition, p. 236, it is stated:\u2014\nIn Viner\u2019s Abr. (m) the following rule is laid down: \u201cEvery statute limiting anything to be in one form, although it be spoke in the affirmative, yet includes in itself a negative\u201d; and in Bacon\u2019s Abr. (n), the rule given is, that \u201cif an affirmative statute which is introductive of a new law direct a thing to be done in a certain way, that thing shall not, even if there be no negative words, be done in any other way.\u201d\nIn Rex v. Howell[22], an accused person was charged with an indictable offence and when brought before the Magistrate, the latter failed to state to him the matters required by the then section 778, subsection 2, of the Code. The accused having elected for a summary trial was found guilty but on appeal the conviction was set aside. Cameron J.A. said in part:\u2014\nThough ss. 2 of sec. 778 of the Criminal Code, as it now stands, amended by 8 & 9, Ed. VII, c. 9, is affirmative in form, it must be treated as implying a negative on the principle that \u201cif an affirmative statute which is introductive of a new law directs a thing to be done in a certain way, that thing shall not, even if there be no negative words, be done in any other way.\u201d\nIt was for the Court of Appeal acting under the powers vested in it by subsection 3 of section 1014 to direct a new trial and not for counsel for the Crown, with the consent of the learned trial judge, or for the Attorney-General, to decide that there should be a second trial for the same offence. When the accused was arraigned before Mr. Justice Schroeder, counsel on his behalf contended that, in the absence of an order for a new trial made by the Court of Appeal, the accused could not be tried again for the same offence. As for the reasons above expressed, I think a new trial for the same offence was, in the absence of such an order, prohibited by the statute, effect should have been given to this objection. I express no opinion upon the other grounds of appeal which were argued before us.\nI would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct the discharge of the accused.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the Appellant: Kimber & Dubbin.\nSolicitor for the Respondent: C.R.

Code.\nAppellant was convicted on a summary trial of receiving stolen goods. It was established that the goods were stolen, that appellant at first had denied possession and later explained this denial and also explained his possession. In his reasons, the trial judge referred to the explanation of denial (saying it was \"fantastic\") but did not refer to the explanation of possession. The majority in the Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction.\nHeld (Taschereau and Locke JJ. dissenting): That there should be a new trial as the trial judge misdirected himself with respect to the relevancy of the denial and had given to it an importance in relation to the main issue of guilty knowledge not justified by the authorities.\nHeld: The omission of the trial judge to refer to the explanation of possession is not remedied by his dealing with it in the report made under section 1020, as that report is relevant only as to how he directed himself at the trial.\nHeld: The statement in the report that the explanation of possession \"was not a reasonable one\" wrongly placed the onus on accused to prove the truth of this explanation, when the trial judge should have directed himself not on the reasonableness of the explanation but whether that explanation \"might reasonably be true\" in the particular circumstances and therefore create in his mind a reasonable doubt.\nPer Taschereau and Locke JJ. (dissenting): The remarks made by the trial judge at the conclusion of the evidence do not show that he had proceeded upon any wrong principle of law. There is no obligation upon a County Court judge at the conclusion of such a hearing to make a complete statement of his reasons for deciding the guilt or innocence of an accused.\nPer Taschereau and Locke JJ.: Having been found in possession, there was a presumption against appellant rebuttal by an explanation which, if it raised a reasonable doubt, entitled him to be acquitted; in the present case, the report shows that the trial judge did not consider that the explanation was a reasonable one and was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant knew the goods were stolen at the time he received them.\nRichler v. The King [1939] S.C.R. 101; Reg. v. Langmead, (1864) 9 Cox C.C. 464; Rex v. Schama, 11 C.A.R. 45; Rex v. Curnock, 10 C.A.R. 208; Rex v. Bush, 53 B.C.R. 252; Rex v. Currell, 25 C.A.R. 116, Rex v. Frank, 16 C.C.C. 237 and Rex v. Gjeller, [1944] 3 W.W.R. 186 referred to. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] dismissing, O'Halloran J.A. dissenting, appellant's appeal from his conviction on a charge of receiving stolen goods.\nJ.W. de B. Farris, K.C. for the appellant.\nL. A. Kelley, K.C. and A. C. Butler for the respondent.\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014I agree with Estey J.\nI do not understand Chief Justice Duff's statement in Richler v. The King[2] as meaning that if the trial judge does not believe the accused it is, nevertheless, his duty to apply his mind to a consideration as to whether the explanation given by the accused might reasonably be true. If the trial judge does not believe the accused the result is that no explanation at all is left, and the case would have to be decided on the well-known principle that possession of recently stolen property is circumstantial evidence of guilt. In the words of Blackburn J. in Regina v. Langmead[3] :\nIf he (the accused) fails to account for his possession satisfactorily he is reasonably presumed to have come by it dishonestly.\nBut, in the present case, on the issue of the accused's credibility, the learned County Court judge, far from stating that he did not believe the accused, refers to the fact that when the latter was \"asked by the police regarding these goods he denied knowing anything about it\" and adds:\nThat, of course, is a factor against him. He has been proved to have made a false statement in one instance, which I am not saying that that detracts from his evidence today but, it is a factor.\nThus the learned trial judge states in his reasons that he did not come to the conclusion that the false statement at first made to the police was, for him, a reason to disbelieve the accused, but that such denial did not detract from the accused's evidence before him at the trial. He says it was only a \"factor\". Therefore, the explanation given by Ungaro of the circumstances under which he came into possession of the goods was not discarded by the trial judge. The explanation was not unreasonable in the premises and, therefore, brought the case strictly within the application of Richler v. The King supra as expressed by Chief Justice Duff.\nIt is manifest, upon the reasons of the trial judge, that he did not apply his mind to the question whether \"the explanation may reasonably be true, though he was not convinced that it was true.\" Indeed he did not refer to that explanation at all, despite the fact that the reasonableness of the explanation was the main point to be considered in the case.\nI do not mean that a trial judge is obliged in his judgment to give all the reasons which lead him to the conclusion that an accused is guilty. Undoubtedly if he finds one valid reason why he should reach that conclusion it is not necessary that he should also give other reasons. It is imperative, however, that he should give a decision upon all the points raised by the defence which might be of a nature to bring about the acquittal of the accused. In the present case, discarding, as he did, as \"fantastic\", the explanation of Ungaro's denial to the police was insufficient to find the accused guilty. It was much more important that the trial judge should have addressed himself to the main point in the accused's defence, and which was the explanation of the circumstances which accompanied the purchase from Seguin, the thief, of the goods stolen. As to that the learned trial judge said absolutely nothing in his reasons, and, reading them, a Court of Appeal is perfectly justified in holding that he completely overlooked this point.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nESTEY J.:\u2014The majority of the learned judges in the Court of Appeal in British Columbia[4] affirmed the conviction of the accused in the County Court Judges' Criminal Court for receiving stolen property knowing it to have been stolen, contrary to sec. 299 of the Criminal Code. Mr. Justice O'Halloran dissented on four grounds:\n(1) The learned trial Judge did not take into judicial consideration the appellant's explanation of his possession of the stolen articles;\n(2) Rex v. Bush[5], does not apply to a case of this kind; (3) The learned judge's report cannot cure No.[6] thereof;\n(4) There was no finding upon credibility within the principle of White v. The King[7] .\nThat the goods were stolen, sold to the accused by a stranger below their value and found in the possession of the accused were clearly established by the evidence. The pertinent issue at the trial was, therefore, did the accused when he purchased these goods know they were stolen?\nThe thief deposed that he sold the goods to the accused but that he was neither asked for nor did he himself volunteer any explanation as to how he obtained or why he was selling the goods.\nThe policeman deposed that when he first interviewed the accused the latter denied all knowledge of the goods and then later, when he returned with a search warrant, though the accused at first persisted in his denial, did then explain that he purchased the goods from a man who said he had obtained them from bankrupt stocks in Vancouver and was selling them in the Valley.\nThe accused, giving evidence on his own behalf, admitted that he had purchased these goods at low prices from the man who now admits he had stolen them, but who then stated to the accused that these goods had been obtained from bankrupt stocks in Vancouver and that he was selling them in the Valley. The accused also explained that to the policeman he denied any knowledge of these goods because of his previous dealings with him and that \"he was scared.\"\nThe accused therefore made two explanations, one as to his denial of possession and the other that the thief told him the goods had been obtained legitimately.\nI agree with all of the learned Judges in the Court of Appeal[8] that in the course of his reasons the learned trial judge refers only to the accused's explanation of his denial to the police and makes no mention of his evidence as to what the thief told him as to the source of the goods. The learned trial judge refused to accept what he termed the \"fantastic\" explanation made by the accused for his denial to the policeman and therefore that denial remained unexplained as evidence of guilty knowledge and also relevant to the issue of the accused's credibility. It did not otherwise here affect the main issue which, after the \"fantastic\" explanation was discarded, still remained to be determined. The emphasis upon this denial without even mentioning the other explanation, which was relevant to the main issue, and particularly the sequence of the language, tends to support a conclusion that the unreasonable denial was given a relevancy and an importance beyond which a proper direction would have permitted and may have constituted the essential factor in finding the accused guilty.\nUpon the main issue of guilty knowledge, in view of the explanation made by the accused and denied by the thief that the latter stated he had obtained goods from bankrupt stocks in Vancouver and that he was selling them in the Valley, the learned trial judge should have instructed himself as in Richler v. The King[9] , wherein Chief Justice Duff on behalf of the court stated the law to be as follows (p. 103):\nThe question, therefore, to which it was the duty of the learned trial judge to apply his mind was not whether he was convinced that the explanation given was the true explanation, but whether the explanation might reasonably be true; or, to put it in other words, whether the Crown had discharged the onus of satisfying the learned trial judge beyond a reasonable doubt that the explanation of the accused could not be accepted as a reasonable one and that he was guilty.\nIt was suggested that the extract quoted from the Richler Case has been misunderstood and our attention was directed to Rex v. Lockhart[10] , where a passage is quoted from Rex v. Searle[11] :\nIt is the reasonableness of the explanation rather than the tribunal's belief in its truth that should guide . . .\nThis language was used in the Searle Case prior to, but its incorporation in the Lockhart Case was subsequent to the Richler Case. With great respect, it is not the reasonableness of the explanation but whether that explanation \"might reasonably be true\" in the particular circumstances and therefore create in the mind of the trial judge a reasonable doubt. It may well be that the reasonableness of the explanation may assist the learned judge in determining that issue. The Appellate Court in Rex v. Lockhart, supra, stated:\n\u2026weighed in the light of all the surrounding circumstances, the explanation given by the accused is not so improbable that it might not reasonably be true.\nIf the Appellate Court, with power to review and make findings of fact, concludes that the statement of the accused \"might reasonably be true\" because of its probability, then in the circumstances no fault can be found with the statement and I think that is the meaning that the learned judges intended to convey.\nThe record in Richler v. The King, supra, discloses that the accused was convicted by a judge presiding under Part 18 of the Criminal Code (Speedy Trials of Indictable Offences) of receiving stolen goods knowing them to have been stolen. The accused gave an explanation as to which there was a conflict between his evidence and that of the thief. One of the contentions on the part of the accused before this Court was that the learned trial judge had rejected his explanation because he did not believe it to be the true explanation. It was in relation to this issue that the statement was made in the Richler Case quoted above.\nThe reference in the Richler Case to the decision in Rex v. Searle was merely to indicate that the latter had followed Schama and not as expressing approval of every phrase used therein by Chief Justice Harvey.\nThe approach to the problem confronting the judge sitting alone or instructing the jury is all important. The instruction in either case should be that the onus rests upon the Crown throughout and that the judge sitting alone or the jury, after considering the explanation made by the accused in relation to all the other circumstances, must determine whether the proof establishes beyond a reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused. A strict adherence to the determination of this question will avoid many of the errors found in the cases. The language used when other questions are considered, as to whether the explanation is the true explanation or a reasonable or probable explanation, places an onus upon the accused to establish one or the other of these as an affirmative fact. Such would be contrary to the fundamental principle of law in which the onus rests upon the prosecution throughout to prove that the accused received the property knowing it to have been stolen. It is true that the possibility of truth or its reasonableness or probability may assist the judge in arriving at his answer to the question of reasonable doubt. As Chief Justice Duff points out, if the judge or jury conclude the explanation \"might reasonably be true,\" which is quite different from whether it is true, reasonable or probable, then a reasonable doubt exists to which the accused is entitled to the benefit.\nThe judgment in the Schama Case, quoted in part in the Richler Case was written by Lord Chief Justice Reading. A few months prior thereto he had written the judgment in the Curnock Case and had included a quotation from Regina v. Langmead[12] , in which Blackburn, J. stated:\nIf a party is in possession of stolen property recently after the stealing, it lies on him to account for his possession, and if he fails to account for it satisfactorily, he is reasonably presumed to have come by it dishonestly; but it depends on the surrounding circumstances whether he is guilty of receiving or stealing.\nIn the Curnock Case[13] Lord Chief Justice Reading refers to the Langmead Case and states:\nIn that case it was decided that the burden of giving a reasonable explanation was on the appellant.\nThese authorities, particularly as read in relation to the Schama Case, leave no doubt but that when Lord Chief Justice Reading refers to the burden in the Curnock Case, and Blackburn, J. in the Langmead Case refers to the failure of the accused to explain recent possession, they mean no more than that the evidence of recent possession unexplained raises a prima facie case upon which, if the accused does not adduce further evidence by way of explanation, the jury may, not must, find the accused guilty. Whether, however, the explanation is given or not the burden of proving the accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt remains throughout upon the prosecution. If, therefore, the accused gives an explanation, as Ungaro did, then the trial judge must instruct the jury, or himself if he is presiding without a jury, as in the Richler Case, supra.\nThe learned trial judge in the present case in referring to the \"fantastic\" explanation made by the accused as to why he had made the false statement to the police states, \"This explanation is not reasonable.\" Then in his report under sec. 1020 he states, \"The explanation given by the accused was not a reasonable one\" and convicted him. On the assumption that he is in the latter referring to the explanation as to the source of the goods, it is clear the learned judge is directing his mind to whether the explanation is a reasonable one. He therefore falls into the same error that those who consider the truth, the reasonableness or the probability of the explanation rather than direct their attention to whether that explanation as made by the accused, having regard to all the circumstances, might reasonably be true and therefore set up in the mind of the judge a reasonable doubt to which the accused is entitled to the benefit.\nThe foregoing is of particular importance where, as in the present case, the explanation, having regard to the circumstances, is not unreasonable and contradicted only by the thief. Reynolds[14] ; Rex v. Norris[15] .\nThe learned trial judge in the course of his reasons makes no mention of the explanation relative to the source of the goods nor of any indication that he had so directed himself. The Crown, under these circumstances, contends that it should be assumed that the learned trial judge directed himself in accord with Richler v. The King, supra. The learned Chief Justice, with whom Mr. Justice Smith agreed, stated as follows:\nIn my view this case falls within Rex v. Bush, (1938) 53 B.C. 252, and Rex v. Miller, (1940) 55 B.C.R. 121 at 128. We must assume, in the absence of anything appearing on the record to indicate otherwise, that the learned trial Judge did apply the proper and relevant principles when considering the explanation of possession given by the appellant.\nIn Rex v. Bush[16] , it was contended that a conviction upon the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice could not be supported upon appeal unless the trial judge had specifically directed himself as to the danger of his so doing. The Court refused to so hold and in this regard did not follow Rex v. Ambler[17] , decided in the same year by the Alberta Appellate Division in which the foregoing submission was accepted and the conviction quashed. This difference of opinion is commented upon in Rex v. Tolhurst[18] , and Rex v. Joseph[19] . It is unnecessary to here resolve this conflict as the authorities are unanimous that where the misdirection is \"manifest\" or the assigned reasons disclose self-misdirection the conviction cannot stand. Rex v. Bush, supra; Rex v. Lockhart, supra; Rex v. Nelson[20].\nIn his reasons, with great respect, the learned trial judge discloses that he had misdirected himself with respect to the relevancy of the denial and given to it an importance in relation to the main issue not justified upon the authorities. Moreover, a reading of the reasons as a whole suggests that he did not direct himself as to the explanation of the source of the goods in relation to the evidence as required in Richler v. The King, supra. There is at least \"reason to doubt that he properly charged himself when forming his conclusions upon the evidence\" as stated by Chief Justice Moss in Rex v. Frank[21] , which, with respect would appear to be an accurate statement of the limitation in respect to the presumption upon which Rex v. Bush, supra, was decided.\nMoreover, it may well be suggested that upon these reasons the learned judge directed himself to the effect that the onus rested upon the accused to establish a reasonable explanation.\nThe Crown contends that whatever consequences might have resulted from the omission to refer to the explanation as to the source of the goods given by the accused, it is remedied by the contents of the report submitted by the learned trial judge under sec. 1020 of the Criminal Code. His report concludes as follows:\nI found as a fact that the explanation given by accused was not a reasonable one and convicted him. In reaching this conclusion I found that accused knew the goods were stolen at the times he received them, that the Crown had satisfied the onus placed upon it and that I had no reasonable doubt.\nThis report read as a whole is another or supplementary statement of reasons supporting the conviction in which the explanation of the source of the goods is as prominent as the explanation of the denial in the reasons given at trial.\nThe question is, how did the learned trial judge direct himself at trial? In his reasons at trial emphasis is placed upon one of two explanations to the entire exclusion of the other and that other the more important to the main issue, and concludes \"this explanation is not reasonable \u2026I have no hesitation in finding that the accused is guilty.\" Then in his report under sec. 1020 he deals with both explanations and then states \"that the explanation given by the accused was not a reasonable one and convicted him.\" It is impossible under these circumstances for an Appellate Court to conclude that he has directed himself within the meaning of Richler v. The King, supra.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed.\nThe dissenting judgment of Taschereau and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nLOCKE, J.:\u2014The appellant having elected for a speedy trial upon three charges of receiving and having in his possession stolen goods, knowing the same to be stolen, was tried by the County Court Judge for the County of Yale and found guilty. The conviction was upheld by a judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[22] and the appeal comes before us upon the grounds of dissent expressed in the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice O'Halloran.\nThe case raises important questions relating to the due administration of the criminal law and it is desirable, in my opinion, to set forth the circumstances in some detail. Ungaro is a hotel keeper living in the city of Vernon, where he operates the Kalamalka Hotel. He has a place of residence elsewhere in Vernon and on January 10, 1949, was there found to be in possession of a brown leather jacket, a quantity of nylon silk stockings and a green and black check car robe, all of which had recently been stolen by one Ernest Seguin. At the trial Seguin swore that the car robe had been stolen by him from an automobile on the streets of Vernon on December 31, 1948: the stockings formed part of a quantity stolen from a parcel in the Canadian Pacific Railway station on January 3, 1949, and the leather jacket from a store at Armstrong, a village some miles to the north of Vernon, on the evening of January 7th. On the evening of the same day, he said that he had gone to the Kalamalka Hotel where he had a room, taking two leather jackets which he had stolen at Armstrong and put them in his room, then went to the beer parlour and waited until it closed at 11.30 p.m. and then took Ungaro to his room, showed him the two jackets and asked him if he wanted to buy them. According to Seguin, Ungaro did not ask him where he had got the jackets but agreed to buy them and gave him $4.00 for the two of them. It is not clear from the evidence of this witness whether or not the transactions in regard to the stockings and the car robe were on January 7th, but the evidence as a whole would indicate that they were earlier on that day. Seguin said as to these that he had gone to the beer parlour of the hotel carrying thirteen pairs of the nylon stockings in a bag: that he had asked Ungaro if he wanted to buy them and that the latter had said that he wanted some member of his family to look them over and, having left apparently for this purpose, returned and paid $7.00 as the purchase price. According to Seguin, he had asked $8.00 but the appellant did not pay this amount. At the same time as he made these sales, he claims to have told the appellant that he had two new blankets and that at about 5 o'clock he brought them to the office of the hotel and sold them to him for $6.00 or $7.00. As in the case of the stockings, Seguin said that Ungaro made no enquiry as to where he had obtained them.\nConstable Knox, a corporal in the Provincial Police, said that on January 10, 1949, he spoke to the appellant at the Kalamalka Hotel telling him that a green car robe had been stolen from one Campbell and that the police had information it had been sold to him. To this the appellant replied that he knew nothing about it. The constable then asked him if he could help him to locate two leather jackets, asking him if he had seen anyone around the hotel wearing them. To this Ungaro replied that he knew nothing about the leather jackets. The constable further asked the accused if he had been in Seguin's room in the hotel on the night of January 7th and he said he had not. Search warrants were then issued, one for the hotel and one for the home of the appellant and Corporal Knox went to the hotel that night and again asked the appellant if he had any knowledge of the green car robe or leather jackets or windbreakers and a quantity of stockings, warning him that he did not have to say anything in reference to these matters but that if he did it could be used in evidence. After again denying any knowledge of these things, Ungaro, according to the police officer, took him to his own home in a car where two other constables were then executing the search warrants and had already located the robe and the stockings. There the appellant produced a leather jacket or windbreaker. On the way from the hotel to the house, Ungaro had told the officer that the things for which the officer was searching had been purchased by him from a man \"who told him he could get clothes of like materials and articles from bankrupt houses in Vancouver.\"\nUngaro who gave evidence on his own behalf said that he had first met Seguin on the day he had purchased the articles, that early in the afternoon of that day Seguin had come in to the beer parlour and stopping at the counter had asked him if he wanted some silk stockings and, when the appellant expressed his desire to see them, produced them contained in individual envelopes in a box and asked how much he (Ungaro) would pay for them. Ungaro says that he then asked Seguin where he got them and that \"he said he got them from bankrupt houses in Vancouver and sold them through the Valley.\" According to the appellant, a large number of people were in the beer parlour when this transaction took place and there was no secrecy about it. On the evening of the same day, the appellant says that Seguin came into the office in the lobby of the hotel with two blankets which were wrapped as if they were new merchandise and offered to sell them. One of these was the stolen car robe. Later that night, he says that Seguin told him he had a jacket for sale in his room and he went up and bought it. He admitted that he made no enquiry as to where Seguin had obtained either the car robe or the jacket. As to the jacket, he said there was no conversation as to the price other than that Seguin asked how much he would pay for it and he told him he would give him $4.00 and did so. At the same time he said that Seguin told him that he would bring a car full of blankets if Ungaro needed them for the hotel and that he had told him that that would be all right. The appellant admitted that he had told Corporal Knox that he did not know where the car robe or leather jacket were but said that this was due to the fact that he had had some previous difficulty with the constable and that he was afraid. While Seguin did not make clear in his evidence the sequence in which the stockings, car robe and windbreaker were sold by him to Ungaro, it is a proper inference, in my opinion, that they were all sold on the same day and that the stockings were sold first. It should, therefore, be taken that if, in truth, Ungaro asked the thief where he had obtained the stockings it was at the first of the three transactions, so that it may fairly be urged on behalf of the appellant that while he did not make the same enquiry as to the other stolen articles he thought they had been obtained by Seguin in the same way. The jacket was shown to be of the value of $16.00: as to the stockings the appellant admitted on cross-examination that he knew that he was getting a bargain in buying thirteen pairs of nylon stockings for $7.00.\nAt the conclusion of the evidence the learned County Court Judge found the accused guilty. His remarks which prefaced the finding were as follows:\u2014\nIn this case it has been proved that the goods were stolen in each case and sold very much below their value in each case, and it was also proved that they were found in the possession of the accused.\nWhen he was asked by the police regarding these goods, he denied knowing anything about it, that, of course, is a factor against him. He has been proved to have made a false statement in one instance, which I am not saying that that detracts from his evidence today, but, it is a factor, and I would say that when he had had other dealings with the police that that would have taught him.\nNow, considering all the circumstances of the accused\u2014Mr. Ungaro\u2014and the other circumstances of the case, it is plain to my mind that this explanation is not reasonable. He says he was scared. It is fantastic.\nI have no hesitation in finding that the accused is guilty.\nIt is, I think, apparent that the explanation referred to in these remarks of the learned trial judge was that given by the appellant for making the false statement to Corporal Knox, to the effect that he knew nothing about the stolen goods. If he had said nothing beyond announcing that he found the accused guilty of the charges, it can scarcely be suggested that the convictions would have been open to attack on any of the grounds now urged against them, since this would involve asking the Appellate Court to assume that the judge had acted upon some wrong principle of law. Here, apart from the statement that the goods had been purchased at an undervalue, the judge directed his remarks to the question of Ungaro's credibility and in considering this mentioned what he thought absurd the explanation given for having made the false statement to the police officer. Why these remarks should be taken to indicate that the trial judge had failed to consider the credibility of the witnesses or, assuming that he believed that Seguin had made the statement attributed to him by Ungaro as to where he had obtained the goods, whether that was an explanation that might reasonably be true, I am unable to understand. If the contention is that where a County Court Judge is conducting a speedy trial and chooses to make any observations as to any aspect of the case before announcing his judgment he must make a complete statement of all of the reasons which have led him to his conclusion, the argument appears to me to be quite without foundation. The learned judge was not required to give any reasons for his judgment unless he chose to do so but, of course, if in stating the reasons for his conclusions he showed that he had proceeded upon some wrong principle of law, the conviction might be set aside, as might the verdict of a jury when there has been misdirection. I find nothing of that nature in what was said by the learned trial judge in the present case and if the matter is to be considered divorced from the report made by him, as required by section 1020 of the Criminal Code, the appeal, in my opinion, fails.\nA more difficult question arises, however, by reason of the terms of this report. It is, I think, unfortunate that the section of the Code does not indicate more clearly the nature of the report to be made. The judge is required to \"furnish to the Court of Appeal in accordance with rules of Court a report giving his opinion upon the case or upon any point arising in the case.\" Whatever else may be included in this language, the trial judge may properly, in my opinion, state, if he wishes, his findings as to credibility if there are any such issues involved and his other reasons for arriving at his conclusion. Of course, if he has given reasons for his judgment at the time of announcing it, he cannot properly give inconsistent reasons as had been done in Baron v. The King[23] . Such a report would be disregarded for the reasons indicated in the judgment of the Court delivered by Chief Justice Anglin. The report and such reasons, if any, as have been delivered are to be read together (Rex v. Reid[24] ). If the report should indicate that the trial judge has proceeded upon a wrong principle, it is manifest that the judgment might properly be set aside, even though reasons given at the time of delivering it indicated no such irregularity.\nIn the report in the present case the following appears:\nCorporal Knox gave evidence of interviewing the accused and receiving an explanation by accused as to his possession of the stolen goods. But this explanation was not given on the first interview. When first interviewed he denied that he had received the goods. On being taken to his residence some hours later he made the explanation which he gave in evidence at his trial. He said the accused told him that he bought the goods from a man who was able to get quantities of bankrupt stock from Vancouver. The thief in his evidence said that accused did not ask him where he got the goods nor did he tell him anything at all as to where he got them. Corporal Knox found the stolen goods in the possession of accused. The accused gave evidence of his financial worth and the explanation he had given Corporal Knox. On cross-examination he stated that previous to coming to Vernon he had been owner of a store dealing in general merchandise.\nI found as a fact that the explanation given by accused was not a reasonable one and convicted him. In reaching this conclusion I found that accused knew the goods were stolen at the times he received them, that the Crown had satisfied the onus placed upon it and that I had no reasonable doubt.\nThe \"explanation given by accused\" referred to in the concluding paragraph, I think, clearly refers to the explanation given by Ungaro as to the statement he said Seguin had made to him as to where he had obtained the goods. The learned trial judge apparently did not note that the explanation made to Corporal Knox by Ungaro was not quite the same as that stated by the latter in his evidence at the trial, so that apparently the difference did not weigh with him. It is, therefore, apparent that the trial judge had directed his attention to the question as to whether the explanation given by the accused was a reasonable one and had come to the conclusion it was not. I do not find that this is inconsistent with anything said by the learned trial judge at the conclusion of the trial. His comments there touched only upon the veracity of Ungaro.\nIt is said for the appellant that there was in the present ease no judicial determination of the question as to whether the explanation given by the accused as to how he obtained possession of the goods might reasonably be true and reference is made to a passage from the judgment of Duff, C.J. in Richler v. The King[25] , reading as follows:\nThe question, therefore, to which it was the duty of the learned trial judge to apply his mind was not whether he was convinced that the explanation given was the true explanation, but whether the explanation might reasonably be true; or, to put it in other words, whether the Crown had discharged the onus of satisfying the learned trial judge beyond a reasonable doubt that the explanation of the accused could not be accepted as a reasonable one and that he was guilty.\nThe statement referred to follows a quotation from the judgment of Reading, L.C.J. in Rex v. Schama and Abramovitch[26] . The language there used has unfortunately given rise to some misunderstanding: the passage in question, which is not stated in full in the judgment in Richler's case, reads:\u2014\nWhere the prisoner is charged with receiving recently stolen property, when the prosecution has proved the possession by the prisoner, and that the goods had been recently stolen, the jury should be told that they may, not that they must, in the absence of any reasonable explanation, find the prisoner guilty. But if an explanation is given which may be true, it is for the jury to say on the whole evidence whether the accused is guilty or not; that is to say, if the jury think that the explanation may reasonably be true, though they are not convinced that it is true, the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal, because the Crown has not discharged the onus of proof imposed upon it of satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt of the prisoner's guilt. That onus never changes, it always rests on the prosecution. That is the law; the Court is not pronouncing new law, but is merely restating it, and it is hoped that this re-statement may be of assistance to those who preside at the trial of such cases.\nIn Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions[27] , Lord Sankey, L.C. delivering the judgment of the House of Lords and pointing out that the burden of proving the guilt of the prisoner always rests upon the prosecution and that there is no such burden laid on the prisoner to prove his innocence, since it is sufficient for him to raise a doubt as to his guilt, said in part:\u2014\nThis is the real result of the perplexing case of Rex v. Abramovitch, 11 C.A.R. 45, which lays down the same proposition, although perhaps in somewhat involved language.\nThe language used by Lord Reading has been interpreted otherwise than in the manner stated by Lord Sankey. In Rex v. Searle[28] , (a case which is mentioned without comment in Richler's case) Harvey, C.J.A. said in part (493):\nWhile recent possession of stolen property is always considered as circumstantial evidence of guilt it is evident that alone it could not, without violation of the general principle, suffice for proof of guilt, because it is not inconsistent with innocence and in Rex v. Schama it was pointed out that it would be a wrong direction in law to tell the jury that, it being established that recently stolen goods were in the prisoner's possession, they might convict, if not satisfied of the truth of the explanation given by the prisoner.\nand again, after referring to the fact that the police magistrate in his report to the court had said in part: \"The accused endeavoured to give an explanation which I have no hesitation in saying was false,\" said (495):\u2014\nIn the present case if the magistrate thought it was sufficient that he should disbelieve the story told he was wrong in his law.\nThe learned Chief Justice, judging from the passages quoted, appears to have overlooked the statement of Blackburn, J. in Reg. v. Langmead[29] , where he states the rule:\u2014\nIf a party is in possession of stolen property recently after the stealing, it lies on him to account for his possession, and if he fails to account for it satisfactorily, he is reasonably presumed to have come by it dishonestly;\na statement which, as stated by Reading, L.C.J. in Thomas Henry Curnock[30] , is the leading authority on the point. With respect, I think it was error to say that possession of recently stolen property did not in itself give rise to a presumption upon which there might be a conviction, in the absence of an explanation. I think also the statement of the learned Chief Justice that if the magistrate thought it was sufficient that he should disbelieve the story told he was wrong in his law, is expressed too broadly and is not justified by anything said in Schama's case. If by this the learned Chief Justice meant that if the explanation given by the accused was considered by the magistrate upon all of the evidence to be untrue and if, accordingly, it raised no reasonable doubt in his mind of the guilt of the accused he was not entitled to convict, I respectfully disagree. Where a person is found in possession of recently stolen property, the presumption referred to in Reg. v. Langmead arises, but this may be rebutted by an explanation by the prisoner as to how it came into his possession. This question was considered in Rex v. Gfeller[31] , a judgment of the judicial committee on appeal from the West African Court of Appeal. The accused in that case was charged with having received a quantity of gin, knowing the same to have been stolen. The appellant, whose wife had an interest in and was manageress of the Grand Hotel at Lagos, assisted her in the buying of goods and spirits and some six months before the date of the offence a Syrian named Jaffar had been introduced to him as a person who could get supplies of alcohol and provisions and he had given him many orders which were fulfilled from time to time. The appellant said that he believed that Jaffar was getting the supplies from various shops and stores. On the day in question Jaffar had told him that he could obtain a large quantity of gin at something less than the current price and the appellant had agreed to take it and to pay him a commission. Later in the day 156 bottles of gin were delivered to the hotel, not packed in any way and being brought there in a taxicab. The appellant said that he did not remember asking Jaffar where he had obtained the gin and Jaffar deposed that he did not tell the appellant where he got the gin. Sir George Rankin, in delivering the judgment of the court, said that the trial judge had dealt with the charge of receiving on the basis of the law laid down in the well known case of Rex v. Schama and quoted from the following statement made in the charge to the jury:\nUpon the prosecution establishing that the accused were in possession of goods recently stolen they may in the absence of any explanation by the accused of the way in which the goods came into their possession which might reasonably be true find him guilty, but that if an explanation were given which the jury think might reasonably be true, and which is consistent with innocence although they were not convinced of its truth the prisoners were entitled to be acquitted inasmuch as the prosecution would have failed to discharge the duty cast upon it of satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.\nand, after expressly approving this statement of the law and pointing out certain circumstances which might cast doubt upon the story of the accused that he had made no inquiry as to the source of the supply or the immediate supplier, said:\u2014\nIn this summary every single fact might turn out to be free from suspicion, but if it can be regarded as a broad statement of the main facts the appellant had something to explain. The question must then be whether the explanation given was such that the learned Judge ought to have directed himself or the jury to the effect that, while they might or might not think it proved, they were obliged to hold that it might reasonably be true and in this limited sense to accept it. Their Lordships are unable so to hold. They think that it was open to the jury to reject as untrue the story that the appellant asked Jaffar nothing and was told nothing about the person from whom Jaffer got so substantial a quantity of gin. The appellant did not have to prove his story but if his story broke down the jury might convict. In other words the jury might think that the explanation given was one which could not reasonably be true, attributing a reticence or an incuriosity or a guilelessness to the appellant beyond anything that could fairly be supposed. The verdict must in view of the summing-up be taken in this sense. Whether it was right, may depend in some measure on the habits of the people and the conditions of life in Lagos at the time or on the mentality of the appellant\u2014 whether he was shrewd or dull, quick or slow-witted, sharp or unsuspecting. These matters are typical of the considerations which a jury may be taken to appreciate, but the existence of a case to go to the jury did not depend upon them.\nThe case gives a practical illustration of the application of the principle in Reg. v. Langmead and of the rule as to the burden of proof.\nIn Rex v. Currell[32] , Hewart, L.C.J. said that Schama's case decided no more than this, that the burden of proof was always upon the prosecution. The passage in that case which has caused so much difficulty was referred to by Lord Goddard, C.J. in Rex v. Booth[33] :\u2014\nThat is a very hard-worked case, and, I think, very often misunderstood. It laid down no new rule of law. All that it said was this: The onus is always on the prosecution in a criminal case. In the case of receiving stolen goods, the prosecution may discharge the onus by showing that the prisoner was in possession of property recently stolen, and, in the absence of any explanation given by the prisoner, the jury are entitled, on that evidence alone, to convict. If, however, the prisoner gives in evidence a story which leaves the jury in doubt, that is to say, creates a doubt in their minds whether he received the goods feloniously, then they should acquit. Rex v. (Schama and) Abramovitch merely means that if the story told by the prisoner has caused doubt in the jury's mind, they should acquit him.\nThis statement and that of Sir George Rankin in Gfeller's case are to be contrasted with the above quoted language from Rex v. Searle and in other cases in which what was said in that case has been adopted. The quoted passage from the judgment of Duff, C.J. in Richler v. The King above mentioned is to the same effect as the language used by Goddard, L.C.J. in Booth's case. The burden is not upon the accused to convince the judge or jury that he is innocent and if his explanation raises a reasonable doubt he is entitled to be acquitted. The effect of the authorities is accurately summarized in Phipson on Evidence (8th Ed. 33) as follows:\u2014\nSimilarly, on charges of stealing or receiving, proof of recent possession of the stolen property by the accused, if unexplained or not reasonably explained, or if though reasonably explained, the explanation is disbelieved, raises a presumption of fact, though not of law, that he is the thief or receiver according to the circumstances; and upon such unexplained, or not reasonably explained, possession, or disbelieved explanation, the jury may (though not must) find him guilty. It is not, however, for the accused to prove honest dealing with the property, but for the prosecution to prove the reverse; and if an explanation be given which the jury think may be true., though they are not convinced that it is, they must acquit, for the main burden of proof (i.e., that of establishing guilt beyond reasonable doubt) rests throughout upon the prosecution, and in this case will not have been discharged.\nIn the present case the learned trial judge, as stated in his report, did not consider that the explanation given by the accused was a reasonable one and was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew the goods were stolen at the time he received them.\nI would accordingly dismiss this appeal.\nAppeal allowed; new trial directed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Farris, Stultz, Bull and Farris.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

Bennett & White (Calgary) Ltd., [1950] S.C.R. 450\nDate: 1950-03-30\nMunicipal District Of Sugar City No. 5 (Defendant) Appellant.\nand\nBennett & White (Calgary) Limited (Plaintiff) Respondent,\nand\nAttorney General Of Canada Intervenant.\n1949: October 25, 26, 27; 1950: March 30.\nPresent: Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand, Estey and Locke JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION\nTaxation\u2014Municipal\u2014Personal property\u2014Construction contract providing that plant and equipment used will be \"property\" of Crown\u2014Whether title of ownership in Crown or in contractor\u2014Whether taxable\u2014Recovery\u2014Distress\u2014Whether decision of Alberta Assessment Commission res judicata\u2014Assessment Act, R.B.A. 1942, c. 157, ss. 5, 86, 46, 53\u2014Municipal District Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 151, s. 870\u2014Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 276, s. 119.\nRespondent contracted to do certain works at an irrigation project for the Crown. It was provided that respondent would furnish all machinery, plant, equipment and materials but that, until completion of the works, they would \"be the property of His Majesty for the purposes of the said works\" without His Majesty being answerable for loss or damage to such property; that they could not be removed-without the consent of His Majesty; and that upon completion of the works they would be delivered to respondent. Should respondent be in default, His Majesty could use this property for the completion of the works and could sell or otherwise dispose of it.\nAppellant assessed and taxed the said plant and materials. On appeal, where it was argued that the property belonged to the Crown, the assessment was confirmed by the Court of Revision and later by the Alberta Assessment Commission. Being threatened with seizure of the plant and equipment under powers of distress given by the Municipal District Act, respondent asked by the present action that the assessment be declared invalid. The trial judge maintained the action and the Appellate Division affirmed.\nHeld: The contract did not transfer the absolute title of ownership which remained in respondent, subject to the clauses binding the use of the plant and equipment to the works and tying them to the area within which they were brought for that purpose. All that was vested in the Crown was a group of rights and powers which, being security for the performance of the contract, would be specifically enforceable and would constitute an interest ad rem. Therefore respondent was taxable but, as there is no statutory provision for the recovery of tax on personal property by action, no such right can be implied nor can the appellant distrain upon the property taxed while it is under the obligations of the contract. Held further: The decision of the Alberta Assessment Commission is not res judicata as regards liability to taxation, because section 53 confers jurisdiction on the Commission only to correct or confirm the actions of the assessors and of the Court of Revision within their administrative jurisdiction of taxation and cannot be construed as vesting in the Commission judicial authority to determine questions of exemptions which involve the civil rights of property owners.\nPer Kerwin J.: The decision of the Alberta Assessment Commission as regards liability to taxation is res judicata, as section 53 clearly confers upon the Commission jurisdiction to determine whether any person was legally assessed. But appellant is not entitled to judgment for the amount of the taxes involved as there is no provision in the Act to recover taxes in respect of personal property as a debt; he can recover by distress but not on the property which is subject to the terms of the contract.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division 1, affirming the decision of the trial judge, Shepherd J., maintaining an action for a declaration that a municipal assessment on personal property was invalid.\nA. C. Virtue, K.C. for the appellant.\nS. J. Helman, K.C. and R. H. Barron for the respondent.\nD. W. Mundell, K.C. for the Attorney General of Canada.\nKerwin J.: The respondent, Bennett & White (Calgary) Limited, brought an action in the Supreme Court of Alberta against the appellant, Municipal District of Sugar City No. 5, for a declaration that the assessment of the respondent for personal property, made by the appellant for the year 1947, is invalid; for an order that the respondent's name be stricken from the appellant's tax roll in respect of personal property for 1947; and for an injunction restraining the appellant from attempting to enforce its alleged claim for taxes and taking any steps to seize any of certain chattels, equipment and tools, hereafter referred to. The appellant counter-claimed for a declaration and decree that the assessment and taxation referred to were properly made and imposed; terminating the interim injunction already granted; in the alternative and in any event, that certain proceedings before the Court of Revision and the Alberta Assessment Commission preclude the respondent from maintaining the action; and, in the further alternative, for judgment against the respondent for the amount of the taxes involved and penalties. The trial judge granted the declaration and order firstly and secondly asked by the respondent, dismissed the counterclaim and, no doubt considering it unnecessary, made no order continuing the interim injunction. His judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division 2.\nThe respondent is a company incorporated under the Companies Act of the Province of Alberta, having its head-office in Calgary, and the appellant is a municipal district constituted pursuant to the provisions of the Municipal District Act, R.S.A. 1942, c. 151. On July 22, 1946, the respondent, therein called the contractor, entered into an agreement with His Majesty, represented therein by the Minister of Agriculture of the Dominion of Canada, to construct certain diversion and irrigation tunnels at the St. Mary's Dam Profect which lies within the boundaries of the appellant. By clause 3 of this agreement, it was provided that the respondent should at its own expense provide all and every kind of labour, superintendence, services, tolls, implements, machinery, plant, materials, articles and things necessary for the due execution and completion of the works, and should deliver the works complete in every particular to His Majesty on or before certain fixed dates. By clause 12, all plant, materials, etc., were included in the price payable by His Majesty under the agreement. By clause 15 (speaking generally) all plant, etc., became the property of His Majesty subject to a term whereby upon the completion of the works such of the plant, etc., as should not have been used and converted in the works, or disposed of by His Majesty under powers conferred by the contract, should upon demand be delivered up to the respondent. This clause reads as follows:\u2014\n15. All machinery, tools, plant, materials, equipment, articles and things whatsoever, provided by the Contractor or by the Engineer under the provisions of sections 14 and 16, for the works, and not rejected under the provisions of section 14, shall from the time of their being so provided become, and, until the final completion of the said work, shall be the property of His Majesty for the purposes of the said works, and the same shall on no account be taken away, or used or disposed of, except for the purposes of the said works, without the consent in writing of the Engineer. His Majesty shall not, however, be answerable for any loss, or damage, whatsoever, which may at any time happen to such machinery, tools, plant, materials, equipment, articles or things. Upon the completion of the works and upon payment by the Contractor of all such moneys, loss, costs and damages, if any, as shall be due from the Contractor to His Majesty, or chargeable against the Contractor, under this contract, such of the said machinery, tools, plant, materials, equipment, articles and things as shall not have been used and converted in the works or disposed of by His Majesty under powers conferred in this contract, shall, upon demand, be delivered up to the Contractor in such condition as they may then be in.\nIn pursuance of this agreement, the respondent moved considerable plant and materials to the site of the works to be performed, the site being owned by His Majesty and being within the limits of the appellant. In 1947, the appellant assessed and taxed the said plant and materials under the provisions of the Assessment Act, R.S.A. 1942, chapter 157, and the Municipal District Act. Upon receipt of notice of the assessment, the respondent, in pursuance of section 35 of the Assessment Act, appealed to the Court of Revision which, by section 37, is composed of members of the council of the municipal district. By a letter supplementary to its notice of appeal to the Court of Revision, the respondent had taken the ground that the plant, etc., which was the subject of the assessment, did not belong to it but to His Majesty in the right of the Dominion of Canada. The Court of Revision confirmed the assessment and, pursuant to section 47, the respondent appealed against that decision to the Alberta Assessment Commission, constituted as provided by the Alberta Municipal Assessment Commssion Act, R.S.A. 1942, chapter 156. Section 53 of The Assessment Act reads as follows:\u2014\n53. In determining all matters brought before the Commission it shall have jurisdiction to determine not only the amount of the assessment, but also all questions as to whether any things are or were assessable or persons were properly entered on the assessment roll or are or were legally assessed or exempted from assessment.\nThe Commission dismissed the appeal except for a reduction in the amount of the assessment.\nThe appellant thereupon threatened to seize the plant and equipment under the powers of distress given it by subsection 4 of section 310 of the Municipal District Act in relation to taxes which are not a lien upon land. The present action followed and the interim injunction referred to above was secured. A number of interesting and difficult questions were argued at bar and some of them are referred to in the reasons for judgment in the Courts below. The first to be determined is whether the decision of the Assessment Commission is res judicata. The trial judge considered that a previous decision of the Appellate Division in In Re Companies Act, In Re Northern Transport Co. Limited and Village of McMurray 3, effectively disposed of the contention, and his reasons were adopted by the Appellate Division in the appeal 4 in the present case. In the McMurray case, the Appellate Division, holding that the principle to be applied was to be found in Toronto Railway Company v. Toronto 5, Victoria v. Bishop of Vancouver Island 6, and Donohue Bros. v. St. Etienne 7, decided that the Alberta Assessment Commission had no power to determine that non-taxable property was taxable.\nThe Toronto Railway case was decided upon the provisions of the Ontario Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1897, chapter 224. Section 68 of that Act enacted with reference to the Court of Revision:\u2014\nAt the time or times appointed, the Court shall meet and try all complaints in regard to persons wrongfully placed upon or omitted from the roll, or assessed at too high or too low a sum.\nProvision was made for an appeal to a Court of Revision, a County Judge, a Board of County Judges where the assessment exceeded a certain amount, and to the Court of Appeal. Proceedings were taken thereunder wherein the Court of Appeal determined that the Railway Company's electric cars were real estate and assessable. The Company brought an action for a declaration that its cars were personal property and not subject to assessment or taxation. The Judicial Committee held, reversing the Court of Appeal and the trial judge, that the previous decision of the Court of Appeal in the assessment proceedings was not res judicata because by section 68 the jurisdiction of the assessment courts was confined to the amount of assessment and did not extend to validate an assessment unauthorized by the statute.\nIn the Victoria case, no appeal from the assessment had been taken by the Bishop, and the Judicial Committee held that provisions whereby any one complaining of an \"error or omission in regard to himself\" as having been wrongfully placed on the assessment roll should have a right of appeal to a Court of Revision and that the assessment roll, as. revised, confirmed and finally passed, should be deemed valid and binding notwithstanding any defect or error, etc., were merely machinery sections and did not empower the corporation or its officers to assess and tax any property expressly or impliedly exempt from taxation.\nIn the Donohue case, which arose in the Province of Quebec, this Court held that the appellant was not restricted to an appeal under the assessment provisions but was entitled to bring an action in the Superior Court for a declaration that the assessment of its machinery was null and void.\nAfter the decision in the Toronto Railway case, the Ontario Assessment Act was amended in 1910 by 10 Edward VII, chapter 88, when section 19 was enacted, which subsequently became section 83 of R.S.O. 1914, chapter 195, whereby power and jurisdiction were given the Court of Revision to determine not only the amount of any assessment but also all questions as to whether any person or things are, or were, assessable. In Village of Hagersville v. Hambleton 8, Hambleton had been assessed by the Village in respect of income and the assessment was confirmed by the Court of Revision and no further appeal taken. The defendant's plea in an action subsequently brought by the Village for taxes, based upon that assessment, that he did not reside in the Village and was not assessable was rejected by the Court of Appeal who held that it was res judicata because of the provisions of section 83. Middleton, J.A., pointed out that in two intervening cases, City of Ottawa v. Nantel 9, and City of Ottawa v. Keefer 10, the attention of the Court had not been drawn to the amendment to the Assessment Act.\nThe Hagersville case was referred to by Smith J., in delivering the judgment of this Court in Sifton v. Toronto 11. There, Sifton removed from Toronto to the Township of York on December 14, 1923. An assessment roll for Toronto had been prepared in 1923, while Sifton still resided there and he was entered on the roll for income. It was pointed out that he could not have successfully appealed against this assessment. In 1924, Toronto adopted, pursuant to a by-law passed in accordance with the Assessment Act, the 1923 assessment as the one for 1924. It was held that the assessment in question was on Sifton's income for 1924 and that by various enactments referred to, the municipality was prohibited from attempting to exercise jurisdiction outside the municipality and was exceeding its powers to \"levy on the whole rateable property within the municipality.\" The Hagersville case was clearly distinguishable and it was held that it had no application.\nIn the subsequent case of City of Ottawa v. Wilson 12, the Court of Appeal held that where a person in an action for income taxes was found to have been not resident in the municipality at the time of assessment, the provisions of the Ontario Assessment Act did not empower the assessor to place her upon the assessment roll. The Hagersville and Sifton cases were referred to by Grant, J.A., and it was found that as the facts underlying the ratio decidendi in the former were not present, the decision did not affect the matter under consideration. Middleton, J.A., and Masten, J.A., who had taken part in the Hagersville decision, agreed. In Becker v. Toronto 13, the Court of Appeal, without giving reasons, held that a man whose property was exempt from taxation could recover taxes paid under protest. In each of these cases the party assessed had not appealed from the assessment.\nIn the present case, section 53 of the Alberta Assessment Act is very clear in conferring jurisdiction upon the Commission to determine whether any things are, or were, assessable, or persons were properly entered upon the assessment roll, or are, or were, legally assessed. That jurisdiction was appealed to by the present respondent and it cannot now be heard to raise the same point again. It is not to the purpose to argue that the members of the Court of Revision were not lawyers and, therefore, presumably incompetent to pass upon legal questions, and that the Commission might not be composed of persons of legal training. The legislature has seen fit to set forth in unmis- takable language the power and jurisdiction of the Commission and the meaning of section 53 should not be abridged even if it were thought that such a power should not have been conferred upon such a body. This is the only point decided and, in the absence of the Attorney General of Alberta, nothing is said as to the power of the legislature to confer such a jurisdiction upon the Commission.\nThe respondent is therefore not entitled to a declaration that the assessment in question was invalid or to an order that its name be stricken from the appellant's tax roll in respect of personal property for 1947 and, on the other hand, the appellant is entitled to a declaration and decree that the assessment and taxation were properly made and imposed. However, the appellant is not entitled to judgment for the amount of the taxes involved. Section 305 of the Municipal District Act provides that the taxes due in respect of any land, mineral, or timber, or business, may be recovered with interest as a debt. There is no reference to taxes due in respect of personal property and the rule is well-settled at common law that there is no such right. Section 370 of the Municipal District Act does not confer it. The appellant is entitled to exercise whatever powers of distress are conferred by subsection 4 of section 310 of the Municipal District Act but, in view of the agreement between His Majesty and the respondent, the appellant is not entitled to seize any of the machinery, tools, plant, materials, equipment, articles and things of the respondent, referred to in the agreement, while they are subject to the terms thereof.\nThe appeal should be allowed and judgment entered for the appellant in accordance with the foregoing. The appellant is entitled to its costs of the claim and counter-claim throughout. There should be no costs to or against the Attorney General of Canada.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Rand, Estey and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nRand, J.: This appeal raises questions going to the taxability of certain plant and equipment used by the respondent as contractor for works undertaken with the Dominion Government. The works were on a large scale and embraced diversion and irrigation tunnels on what is known as the St. Mary Dam Project. The plant and equipment belonged to the respondent and was within the municipality in such circumstances that if they had not been affected by the terms of the contract there would have been no question of their liability to taxation.\nThe main point of controversy arises from the provisions of paragraph 15 which reads thus:\u2014\nAll machinery, tools, plant, materials, equipment, articles and things whatsoever, provided by the Contractor or by the Engineer under the provisions of sections 14 and 16, for the works, and not rejected under the provisions of section 14, shall from the time of their being so provided become, and, until the final completion of the said work, shall be the property of His Majesty for the purposes of the said works, and the same shall on no account be taken away, or used or disposed of, except for the purposes of the said works, without the consent in writing of the Engineer. His Majesty shall not, however, be answerable for any loss, or damage, whatsoever, which may at any time happen to such machinery, tools, plant, materials, equipment, articles or things. Upon the completion of the works and upon payment by the Contractor of all such moneys, loss, costs and damages, if any, as shall be due from the Contractor to His Majesty, or chargeable against the Contractor, under this contract, such of the said machinery, tools, plant, materials, equipment, articles and things as shall not have been used and converted in the works or disposed of by His Majesty under powers conferred in this contract, shall, upon demand, be delivered up to the Contractor in such condition as they may then be in.\nThe effect of that paragraph is said to be to vest such a title or interest to the plant and equipment in the Crown or to affect the title of the respondent in such manner as renders the assessment invalid, and the first question is whether that conclusion is sound.\nIt will be seen that both plant, equipment and materials are included, and that they are declared to be the property of His Majesty \"for the purposes of the said works\". The purpose of the materials is obviously quite different from that of the plant and equipment, and the qualifying clause must appropriately respond to that difference. It was argued that the phrase defines the time or period of a transferred ownership; but at law there are no estates or remainders in personal property: the only title is the absolute title. The true conception where successive ownerships in A and B are in mind seems to be that the property in B is made subject to a right or power of use in A for a specified period: but no doubt contractual stipulations may affect transfers of title on the happening of events or conditions.\nThe effect of the clause is both to bind the use of the plant and equipment to the works, and to tie them to the area within which they are brought for that purpose. It is seen that the Minister may permit units to be removed from the works which the contractor would be at liberty to return, and it would be treating title rather freely to conceive it as shuttling back and forth as the units might move on or off the working grounds.\nThe contractor is undoubtedly to remain in actual and legal possession of the plant and equipment while he is not in default; likewise his beneficial interest in them is not affected and with it the risk of loss or damage. Power is given to the Minister, in certain contingencies, to take the works, as it is said, \"out of the hands\" of the contractor and use the plant and equipment to complete them. Upon completion, the plant and equipment are to be, not \"reconveyed\" or \"re-transferred\" to the contractor, but \"delivered up\" to him as they may then be, which I take to signify no more than that the powers binding them come to an end.\nThen it is contemplated that the plant or equipment or parts of either may not be owned by the contractor at all, but hired or rented by him, as in paragraph 29 which speaks of sums due for \"hire of horses, teams or carts\" \"or any claims against the contractor, or any subcontractor for \u2026 plant, equipment \u2026 hired or supplied upon or for the works\". In case of default, also, paragraph 18 provides that, \"all plant, including horses and all rights, licences, powers and privileges affecting the personal property acquired or possessed by the contractor for the purposes of the work shall remain and be the property of His Majesty for all purposes incidental to the completion of the works, and may be used, exercised and enjoyed by His Majesty as fully, to all intents and purposes, connected with the works as they might theretofore have been used, exercised and enjoyed by the contractor, and the Minister may also, at his option, on behalf of His Majesty, sell or otherwise dispose of\" them. Shepherd, J. at the trial who found against the assessment seemed to extract some support for his view from the language of paragraph 12 providing, as he stated it, \"that all plant and materials furnished by the plaintiff were included in the prices payable by the Government under the agreement\"; but that, with great respect, does not seem to be the true meaning of the language paraphrased. What is there being declared is that the price or prices shown in paragraph 34, which deals with unit prices, include everything done and furnished by the contractor and the reference to the plant excludes by way of precaution any question of adding to those prices rental or other compensation for the use of the equipment. Such allowances are, in special circumstances, contemplated by the paragraph which, for new work, provides that in addition to the actual and reasonable cost, \"10 per cent thereon for the use of tools, contractor's plant, superintendence and profits\" is to be allowed. It is, I think, incontrovertible that neither plant nor equipment is, in such sense, \"paid for\" by the Crown.\nThese stipulations make it clear to me that what has been vested in the Crown, in relation to the plant and equipment, is a group of rights and powers to the extent of the contractor's title or interest in them; and that the contractor employs his own property as he would ordinarily do but within those restrictions both as to its use and its residence. The effect of the language is not, \"I give you the property but subject to my use of it for the purposes of the contract\"; it is rather, \"I give you the right to have the property kept on your land and its use applied to those purposes whether I fulfill them or some one else does\". That arrangement is virtually identical with that in Keen v. Keen, Ex p. Collins 14. Such was the situation at the time of the assessment.\nOn appeal 15, Ford J.A. seems to lay it down that taxability of personal property depends upon the competency of the taxing authority at the moment of assessment to exercise against the property the powers of distress given by the statute, which, in some manner, follows from the fact that the power given is \"to tax property and not persons in respect of an interest therein\". What, then, is meant by taxing property as distinguished from persons in respect of property?\nThe notion that to \"tax property\" is to subject it, as a legal object, to some sort of inhering obligation vaguely to be regarded as the equivalent of a lien, is, I think, a misconception. Although the Assessment Act speaks of the taxation of property or business, it does not always do so: section 26(3), \"every person who is assessed in respect of such property\"; section 32, \"where any person was at the time of the assessment taxable in respect of any property, business, trade or profession\"; section 33, similar language but also \"the assessment of the property\"; section 291 of the Municipal Districts Act refers to business taxes \"payable by each person assessed \u2026 in respect of a taxable business\"; section 295, to the taxes due by a person whose name appears on the roll \"in respect of the property or business for which he is assessed\"; section 310(4), dealing with distress for taxes which are not a lien on land, in paragraph (a) provides for distress \"upon the goods or chattels of the person taxed wherever found within the province\"; and paragraph (c), \"upon the goods and chattels in the possession of the person taxed, etc.\"\nOn the other hand, section 305, dealing with taxes \"due in respect of any land, etc.\", declares that they may be recovered as a debt and \"shall be a special lien on the land\". But no lien is created on personal property. Although the personal property existing at the time is the basis of the assessment, the collection of the tax is not in any manner bound up with it. The tax based on today's personal property may be collected on tomorrow's property, whether within or without the municipality. These provisions distinguish between the assessment and imposition of a tax and the modes of collection, but all three of them must be found either expressly or impliedly in the taxing statute; together they constitute the legislative authority and power for the exaction. Except as it may be evidential of an implied means of collection, the conception of the assessment, per se, as of property or of a person in relation to property, carries no practical significance of difference. The Minister's rights and powers, being security for the performance of the contract, would be specifically en- forceable and constitute an interest ad rem. It may be, on the principle of In re Marriage, Neave & Co. 16, that such an interest cannot be asserted by a subject against a distress of this nature: but, as enjoyed by the Crown, it could not so be defeated.\nBut these rights and powers are no essential part of the title; they are exercisable in relation to the use of the property and so far they derogate from one of the incidents of ownership; but they assume title in the contractor. Being of such a nature, the interest as at the time of assessment, if held by a subject, would not be a taxable interest under the Assessment Act.\nThe statute contains nothing that even purports to make assessability conditional upon contemporaneous exigibility by distress. The basic fact for assessment is the ownership or legal possession of personal property, and here, at the critical time, both were in the respondent. Goods subject to a chattel mortgage and in the possession of the mortgagor are clearly liable to assessment and to distress, and, seemingly, I should say, distrainable whether or not in his possession, where not in the possession of the mortgagee. Before that step, the mortgagor is the owner within the meaning of the statute. A fortiori a mere interest ad rem does not affect that title or prevent a distress.\nTaking the personal property, then, as being taxable, can the taxes be recovered by suit against the owner as for a debt? Since the remedy must appear from the statute and as the statute here, while specifically providing for the recovery by suit of taxes imposed in respect of land, has not done so for taxes on personal property and has instead provided the means of distress, no such right can be implied.\nIt is objected that the interest of the Crown, exempt from taxation, has nevertheless been included in the property taxed; but as that interest was not at the time of assessment a taxable interest, and the value of the user has never in fact been out of the contractor, the point falls. Moreover, this contention ignores the distinction between taxing an interest of the Crown and taxing an interest of the subject as if, for purposes of amount, he were the owner of the Crown's interest: Fairbanks v. Halifax 17.\nThe remaining question is whether any of the plant and equipment is exempt under paragraph (z) of section 5(1) as being within the expression \"motor vehicles\". The word \"vehicle\" in its original sense conveys the meaning of a structure on wheels for carrying persons or goods. We have generally distinguished carriage from haulage, and mechanical units whose chief function is to haul other units, to do other kinds of work than carrying, are not usually looked upon as vehicles. But that meaning has, no doubt, been weakened by the multiplied forms in which wheeled bodies have appeared with the common feature of self-propulsion by motor.\nThe object, then, of the exemption becomes important; and, quite apart from the canon that an exemption from taxation should be in precise language, it seems to me that in this case, in relevant statutory expressions that object does appear. By section 119 of The Vehicles and Highway Traffic Act, chap. 275, R.S.A. 1942, it is declared that except where an Act specifically provides to the contrary, \"no municipality shall have the power to pass, enforce or maintain any by-law requiring from any owner of a motor vehicle or chauffeur, any tax, fee, licence or permit for the use of the public highways \u2026\". Although the tax is associated with the use of the highways, I take it to evidence the intention that the exaction of fees or taxation for motor vehicles\u2014which, to some extent at least, use highways as part of their normal operation\u2014is to be provincial and not municipal. But \"motor vehicle\" in that Act does not include traction engines or vehicles running on rails. What was intended by the exemption in the Assessment Act was to make clear the uniformity between the two statutes. The exemption then does not include units of self-propelled equipment whose main purpose is either that of haulage or work other than conveying or vehicles running on rails as distinguished from general locomotion.\nThe objects fall within four categories. There are, first, what are described as dumptors assessed at $18,000:\u2014these are ordinary four-wheeled vehicles with gasoline engine, the body of which is a box and the purpose of which is to carry material from place to place. I am unable to distinguish them from the ordinary truck, and they would seem clearly to be exempt. The second class consist of caterpillar tractors used, with concave blades attached to the front as bulldozers, or with other devices attached behind to gather up material of excavation. These, as clearly, are not exempt. The third are known as draglines; these are large units, in operation like mechanical shovels, which excavate earth and other materials by means of a scoop bucket dragged along the ground by heavy cables. The entire body moves on caterpillar treads by its own power, but as can be seen, its whole function is that of doing work as against carrying, which excludes it from the exemption. The fourth are locomotives and cars which run on rails to carry away the excavated material: they remain taxable. Other items of equipment such as dozer blades, caterpillar power units, dragline buckets, and Le-tourneau Carryalls, are all accessories to or integral parts of the units in the four classes, which they must follow.\nIn the result, then, the assessment should be reduced by the amount representing the dumptors and their accessories; subject to that, it remains.\nMr. Virtue contends that as the respondent appealed both to the Court of Revision and the Alberta Assessment Commission, the taxability of the respondent is by the effect of section 53 of the Assessment Act res judicata. The section provides:\u2014\nIn determining all matters brought before the Commission it shall have jurisdiction to determine not only the amount of the assessment, but also all questions as to whether any things are or were assessable or persons were properly entered on the assessment roll or are or were legally assessed or exempted from assessment.\nThis language, it will be noticed, does not purport to conclude issues on the questions mentioned. If the Commission were an ordinary court, dealing in a judicial sense with matters of civil rights, the import of jurisdiction would be unquestioned. But taxation is essentially an administrative function; the assessor is directed by the statute to ascertain the value of certain property as the basis on which the province will exact a contribution from persons interested in it to enable government to be carried on. That ascertainment is an act in rem and its execution, given the jurisdiction to tax, lies in such mode and such means as the legislature may prescribe.\nBut the statute, in denning the subject matter of taxation, necessarily limits the scope of legal action, and if, as. we say, a subject is excluded from taxation, then as to it, a purported administrative act would have no legal effect.\nWhether an act is or is not within a jurisdiction depends, if challenged, upon a determination by a tribunal. Ordinarily, jurisdictional facts, arising under a statute, are found by the civil courts; and when we speak of a finding of non-assessability of property, we mean as that conclusion has been or is declared by those tribunals. But the initial question is not what the fact is in actuality, which must be as it appears to some mind; it is rather, what is the tribunal to which we must look for that jurisdictional determination?\nIn dealing with taxation, from assessors to taxation commissions, the provisions of the statute regarding liability and exemption are necessarily taken into account by lay persons and bodies. The determination of an exemption involves an interpretation of the statute, and it thus affects a civil right. But the assessor must have regard to exemptions for the purpose of the administrative integrity of the roll; and although it is his duty to follow the provisions of the statute to the extent his judgment permits him to do so, it is undoubted that that preliminary judgment is essentially different from a judicial determination of the legal question.\nThe assessor, as part of his administrative duty, and as distinguished from purely administrative acts, exercises a lay judgment in the interpretation of the statute. From the whole of his exercise of authority, the statute ordinarily gives a right of appeal. By the nature of appeal, in the absence of special and original powers given to the revising body, it is to be taken as limited to examination of the matter that was before the assessor and to the giving, in the same sense, of the decision which he should have given.\nIn this case, section 35 of the Assessment Act provides for a complaint to the Court of Revision which is to be in respect of:\u2014\n(a) any error or omission alleged in respect of the assessment of any property or persons;\n(b) any assessment alleged to be too high or too low; (c) any property or business in any way wrongfully assessed;\n(d) the name of any person alleged to be wrongfully entered upon or omitted from the assessment roll.\nSection 45 provides:\u2014\nUpon the termination of the sittings of the Court of Revision \u2026 the Secretary-Treasurer shall \u2026 enter \u2026 the following certificate \u2026; and the roll as thus finally completed and certified shall be the assessment roll for that year, subject to amendment on appeal to the Alberta Assessment Commission \u2026 and shall be valid and bind all parties concerned, notwithstanding any defect in or omission from the said roll or mistake made in or with regard to such roll or any defect, error or misstatement in any assessment slip or notice or any omission to deliver or to transmit any assessment slip or notice.\nAuthority must obviously be vested in that court to amend in any respect the roll as completed by the assessor, and the provisions of the Act do that. As in the case of the assessor, finality is given or confirmed to the purely administrative acts, but in the quasi-judicial determinations, the decision is of the same character as that of the assessor.\nIt is seen, next, that further amendment by the Assessment Commission shall be \"on appeal\", and it is on that footing that section 53 confers jurisdiction on the Commission as preceding sections had vested jurisdiction in the Court of Revision. But following the same rule, what the Commission does is to correct or confirm the actions of the assessor and the Court of Revision within their jurisdictions. It is for determining \"all matters brought before the Commission\" that the jurisdiction is declared, but those matters are such as come by way of appeal, and I see nothing in the section which introduces a new and original authority to deal with those matters in other than the administrative manner in which they have already been dealt with: I see nothing intended to confer a purely judicial function dealing with civil rights.\nThe material sections in the Alberta Act have their prototypes in provisions of the Ontario Assessment Act, and it is argued that the case of Village of Hagersville v. Hambleton 18 has given an authoritative interpretation of section 83, which corresponds to section 53, to the effect that a confirmation by the Court of Revision of an assessment for income tax was conclusive as to the residence of the person assessed. The Judicial Committee in Toronto Railway Company v. Toronto 19, had found the jurisdiction of the Court of Revision limited to the question of more or less in value, from which it followed that whether a person was or was not a resident of a municipal area within the meaning of the statute was a question to be determined by the civil courts. But section 83 had been amended and the application of that authority was rejected. Riddell, J.A., at the opening of his judgment, says:\u2014\nI may say at once that if the liability of the defendant to be assessed depended on the evidence of residence given at the trial, the judgment appealed from could not stand.\nHe held the amendment to have established exclusive tribunals of appeal to which only the assessed person could resort, and that the fact of residence as found by the Court of Revision was conclusive. In this view, the other members of the Court concurred.\nIn the next year, Sijton v. City of Toronto 20 came before the same court. There, the plaintiff had resided in Toronto from the beginning of the year until the 14th of December of 1923 when he moved to and became a resident of another municipality where he continued to reside during the whole of 1924. He had been assessed in 1923 for income and had paid the tax to Toronto. Under section 56 of the Assessment Act, on the 28th of February, 1924, Toronto passed a by-law adopting the assessment made for 1923 as that for the current year 1924, and later in 1924 demanded taxes accordingly from the former taxpayer. They were paid, and proceedings brought to recover them. On appeal from the judgment of the County Court dismissing the action, the court was equally divided: Mulock, C.J., and Grant, J.A. were to dismiss and Magee, J.A. and Hodgins, J.A. were for allowance. In this Court 21, the judgment below was reversed. Smith, J., who gave the judgment, distinguished the case of Hagersville v. Hamble-ton 22 on the ground that upon the adoption of the roll by the by-law of February 28th there was no tribunal to which the taxpayer could appeal against an improper assessment. But what lay at the bottom of the decision was the fact that in February, 1924, when the resolution of adoption of the roll was passed, the person assessed was not resident in Toronto. There was an apparent conflict between the statutory provision that Toronto could tax only those who were resident within its boundaries, and the declaration that the roll as certified was to be the roll for the year in question. But the fact giving rise to that conflict was held to be determinable by the civil court, and the former provision to be controlling.\nThat case was followed by Ottawa v. Wilson 23. The situation was somewhat similar. Before the assessment against the defendant was made, she had moved from Ottawa to Rockcliffe, but after that removal, and in the same year, her name had been entered upon the roll for Ottawa. No appeal was taken to the assessment tribunals. In an action to recover the taxes, it was held that it was ultra vires of Ottawa to assess a person who, as determined by the civil courts, was not a resident. Although the Hagersville case is mentioned, it is declared by Grant, J.A. that, as interpreted by the Sifton judgment, it did not affect the case at bar. With Grant, J.A. agreed Mulock, C.J.O. and Masten, J.A. Middleton, J.A. concurred in those views: he treated the Sifton decision as carrying to its logical conclusion the principle that a person can only be assessed for income \"in the municipality in which he resides\". But again arises the question, as found by what tribunal?\nSo far as the Hagersville case declares an exclusive jurisdiction in the assessment tribunals for determining the fact of residence, it mus't be taken to be inconsistent with these subsequent decisions; and I attribute to those tribunals only a jurisdiction of an administrative body as I have defined it. What questions of law involved in the assessment can be dealt with on appeal from those tribunals to a superior court, a step which in Alberta does not lie, depends on the language of the statute giving the right of appeal. What appears then is this, that if as found by the civil courts, jurisdiction for the act of assessment is absent, neither the decision of the assessment courts nor any statutory provision dealing with the conclusiveness of the roll is effective. That was the view taken of somewhat similar language in R. M. Buckland v. Donaldson 24, and in Victoria v. Bishop of Vancouver 25.\nThe same principle applies a fortiori to the question of exempted property. Whatever may be determined to be in that class is beyond the jurisdiction of assessment; and the judicial interpretation and application of the language of exemption is for the civil courts.\nIt may be, given property within the province, that the legislature might declare the scope of the exemption should be as interpreted by the assessment tribunal: that would be to vest a sub-legislative taxing authority in the Commission. But in this case the legislature has not done so. Or the legislature might purport to set up special provincial courts to interpret judicially legislative provisions affecting civil rights. If it were clear that that was the effect of the statute in this case, then the serious question of ultra vires would be presented. But where the legislative language is capable, as here, of being given rational meaning within undoubted provincial authority, and any other view would raise doubts and anomalies within the statute, the legislature's intention to go beyond that authority and within a questionable field should not be inferred.\nFor these reasons, section 53 is not to be construed as purporting to vest in the Assessment Commission judicial authority to determine questions of jurisdiction arising out of the provisions declaring exemptions; as the civil rights of owners of property are involved, the section is to be taken, in that respect, to contemplate only such dealing with the roll by the Commission in the exercise of its practical judgment on such matters as will render it as free as possible from errors of law.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and, subject to the modification in the assessment roll mentioned, dissolve the injunction and dismiss the action. On the counterclaim, the appellant is entitled to a declaration that the taxes as modified were properly imposed: but the appellant cannot distrain upon the property taxed while it is under the obligations of the contract. The appellant should have its costs of the action including the counterclaim throughout. The intervention of the Attorney General will be without costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Virtue, Russell and Morgan.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Helman, Mahaffy and Barron.\nSolicitor for the intervenant: D.

B. Smith, K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. T. MacQuarrie, K.C. and A. J. MacLeod for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Rand, Kellock, Estey, Locke and Cartwright, JJ. was delivered by\nKellock J.: This is an appeal from the decision of the Exchequer Court, Cameron J. 2 affirming the dismissal by the Minister under the provisions of The Income War Tax Act of an appeal by the appellant in respect of its assessment for income for the years 1939, 1940 and 1941.\nDuring the said years the appellant derived its entire income from mining the coal from \"the 40 Brine Seam\"; the right to mine which was granted inter alia by two \"mining leases\" made by the Province of Nova Scotia in 1903 and renewed on July 2, 1923, on the basis of certain rents and royalties.\nThe interest of the original lessee in these leases was acquired by one Ralph Parsons by virtue of a sale under execution and he became duly entered in the records of the Provincial Mines Office as the lessee.\nOn June 4, 1937, the said Parsons entered into an agreement with the Fundy Coal Company Ltd. to sell to the latter all his right, title and interest in the said mining leases and this company, by agreement of June 7, 1937, assigned to the Tantramar Coal Company all its right in the agreement with Parsons and its interest in the mining leases.\nAgain, on June 1, 1939, the Tantramar Company entered into an agreement with one J. H. Winfield, by which the Tantramar Company, as \"vendors\", granted to Winfield, as \"purchaser\", \"the sole and exclusive right or option to mine and purchase such coal as the purchaser desires to win from the said 40 Brine Seam under the terms and conditions hereinafter recited\". This agreement provided for the payment of certain royalties on a graduated scale to the vendors as well as the provincial royalties and obligated the purchaser to mine all the marketable coal in the seam which, under sound mining practice, would be practical and expedient to mine from a certain shaft then under construction. Subject to certain indefeasible rights in any shafts sunk, the agreement provided that if the purchaser at any time ceased reasonably active operations on the seam, any coal remaining therein should \"revert\" to and be the sole property of the vendors. By agreement of September 2, 1989, Winfield, as vendor, assigned and transferred to the appellant, as purchaser, all his rights in the leases and undertook to perform all obligations of the vendor.\nIt is convenient at this point to refer to the nature of the rights granted by the original \"leases\" themselves. The surface rights in the lands in respect of which the leases here in question were issued had previously been granted to private owners and under the provisions of the Statute, R.S.N.S. (1923) c. 22, the lessee was prohibited from entering upon or using the lands for mining purposes without acquiring a right to do so by agreement with the owner of the surface rights or by proceedings taken under other provisions of the statute.\nBy section 184 \"lease\" is defined, so far as minerals other than gold or silver are concerned, as \"a lease of the right to mine minerals\", and by section 185 \"every application for a lease shall state the mineral for which the right to mine is sought and shall describe the tract of ground sought to be covered by such * * * lease\". By the statutory form of lease the Crown \"grants and demises unto the lessee all the rights of the Crown to the * * * (coal?) * * * in that certain tract of ground situated at and described as follows. It also provides that:\nthe lessee shall have during the term of this lease or any renewal thereof the exclusive right of mining for and taking for his own use all * * * contained in the said tract of ground and appropriating the same to his own use.\nIt is also expressly provided that nothing in the lease shall authorize entry by the lessee upon the surface of the land or interference in any way with it.\nThe matter here in issue involves the right of the appellant to an allowance or deduction from its taxable income for \"depletion\" under the provisions of section 5(1) (a) of the Income War Tax Act. With relation to the taxation year 1939 the Act read as follows:\n5. \"Income\" as hereinbefore defined shall for the purposes of this Act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions:\u2014\n(a) * * * the Minister in determining the income derived from mining * * * shall make such an allowance for the exhaustion of the mines * * * as he may deem just and fair, and in the case of leases of mines * * * the lessor and the lessee, shall each be entitled to deduct a part of the allowance for exhaustion as they agree and in case the lessor and the lessee do not agree the Minister shall have full power to apportion the deduction between them and his determination shall be conclusive.\nThis appeal was argued on the footing, and it must now be taken to be the fact, that the Minister in the exercise of his discretion with respect to the making of an allowance for exhaustion or depletion of the particular mine here in question, fixed the allowance at ten cents per ton of coal actually mined. However, while the appellant mined some 29,000 tons of coal in the year 1939, the Minister refused it any part of this allowance. His ground for so doing is made clear in certain letters written to the appellant pending its appeal to the Minister, by the Director General of the Legal Branch of his department.\nIn a letter of December 4, 1947, the following appears:\nThis case presents special difficulties, in that it raises the question as to which of two taxpayers is entitled to the depletion allowance under paragraph (a) of section 5 of the Income War Tax Act.\nOn the facts in this case we would consider that the lessor is the Crown in the right of the Province of Nova Scotia and as the province is not a taxpayer, there is no question of making an allowance to the lessor. The question, however, remains as to the proper party to be considered as the lessee.\nThe agreement dated 1st June, 1939 under which J. H. Winfield, and subsequently this company, (the appellant) obtained the right to operate the mine, is not made in the form of a lease or sub-lease, but appears to be merely for the sale of the coal in the mine. The purchaser obtains \"the sole and exclusive right or option to mine and purchase such coal as the purchaser may desire to win from the said 40 Brine Seam\". Under clause 8 of this agreement, the coal reverts to the vendor if the purchaser ceases to mine the property.\nIn our opinion, this agreement is not a sub-lease or assignment of a lease, but merely a sale of the coal and the necessary licence to mine the coal. The vendor apparently remains the lessee from the Crown and would therefore be the lessee within the meaning of the relevant provisions of the Income War Tax Act.\n* * * If the Tantramar Company had assigned all its interest to the Joggins Coal Company Limited, then we would agree that the Joggins Company became the lessee in place of the Tantramar Company, but as stated before, we do not think the agreement in 1939 has this effect.\n(The Italics are mine.)\nA further letter of January 14, 1948, reiterates the refusal of the Department \"to accept the proposition that this company\" (the appellant) \"is the lessee of the Crown within the meaning of section 5 (a)\". Referring to the agreement of June 1, 1939, the letter states:\nPresumably, the Tantramar Coal Company Limited takes the stand that it was not' a lease, but merely a sale of the coal and a licence to operate the property.\nThe letter continues:\nThis Department is in the position of having to decide which of two taxpayers is entitled to the allowance for depletion in the absence of an agreement between them. To give your client the benefit of the doubt would require depriving another taxpayer of the allowance. Under these circumstances, we consider that the question should be determined by the Exchequer Court.\n* * *\nYour appeal can only be sustained on the grounds that the Joggins Company has replaced the Tantramar Company as lessee from the Crown and as stated before, we do not consider this to be the effect of the Agreement of June, 1939.\nIn accordance with the view thus expressed, the appellant was excluded from all benefit under the section. It received no allowance for depletion in 1939, although its entire income was \"derived from mining\".\nThe statement of defence maintains this position. It alleges:\n(a) That the Appellant has no proprietary or other exhaustible interests in the mine from which it derives its income;\n(b) That the Appellant is not a Lessee of the said mine within the contemplation of paragraph (a) of subsection 1 of Section 5 of the Income War Tax Act;\nIn my opinion the respondent's stand is based on a complete misapprehension of the status of the appellant under the statute. The word \"lessee\" is not there used in the narrow or technical sense attributed to it by the Minister. Leases of mines commonly take the form of granting nothing more than the exclusive right to mine the coal and to appropriate it to the use of the grantee. Lord Cairns in Gowan v. Christie 3, at 263 said: For although we speak of a mineral lease, or a lease of mines, the contract is not, in reality, a lease at all in the sense in which we speak of an agricultural lease * * * What we call a mineral lease is really, when properly considered, a sale out and out of a portion of land. It is liberty given to a particular individual, for a specific length of time, to go into and under the land, and to get certain things there if he can find them, and to take them away, just as if he had bought so much of the soil.\nAs has already been pointed out in the above references to the Nova Scotia legislation nothing more than this was granted by the original leases and nothing more could be or was acquired by the Tantramar Company and by it transferred to the appellant. The reason given for refusing to consider the appellant as a \"lessee\" because the assignment to it from Tantramar was \"merely a sale of the coal and the necessary licence to mine\" involved therefore a misapprehension of the position in law of the appellant and was accordingly not a good ground of disqualification of the appellant under the statute. The fact that Tantramar retained an interest entitling it to royalties instead of its interest having been bought out once and for all by a capital payment does not differentiate the nature of the rights acquired by appellant from the Tantramar Company from those acquired by the latter from the Fundy Company. The persons concerned under the section were the Tantramar Company and the appellant, as lessor and lessee, respectively, for the purpose of apportioning between them the allowance for depletion of the mine from which both derived their entire income.\nIt may further be observed, in considering the sense in which the word \"lessee\" is used in the statute, that the Judicial Committee in Fraser's case 4, considered that the holder of a licence to cut timber was within the section. The contention to the contrary on the part of the Minister was abandoned in the Privy Council. The same view of the statute was the basis of the decision in McCool v. Minister of National Revenue 5.\nComing now to the 1939 assessment, which is first to be considered the Statute in its then form, provided that taxable income derived from mining \"shall\" be subject to certain specified deductions and that In determining such income the Minister \"shall\" make such allowance for exhaustion as he deems just and fair, with the provision for apportionment already referred to. Therefore, in determining the appellant's taxable income for 1939, the Minister had laid upon him an \"administrative duty of a quasi-judicial character\u2014a discretion to be exercised on proper legal principles,\" to employ the language of the Judicial Committee in the Pioneer Laundry case 6, at 259. If he did not consider the appellant a \"lessee\" the provision for \"apportionment\" had no application to the appellant whose legal right to some depletion allowance under the earlier part of the section remained, and \"no proper legal principle\" has been invoked under which it could be withheld. It is only when the Minister is apportioning depletion allowance between lessor and lessee that the Minister's decision is conclusive. Nothing of the kind arises here. The Minister considered Tantramar as the lessee and the province the lessor, and as the Province was not a taxpayer, he gave the full allowance for depletion allotted to the mine to Tantramar. The fundamental error was accordingly an error in law in failing to appreciate the true position of the appellant and in depriving it of its statutory right to an allowance for depletion.\nIn my opinion therefore, the respondent cannot rely upon the concluding words of the section. He did not act under them as he considered the appellant did not come within them. So far as the 1939 assessment is concerned therefore, the appeal should be allowed and the matter referred back to the Minister for disposition under the section.\nIn 1940 the statute was amended by the substitution of the word \"may\" for \"shall\" where that word first appears in paragraph (a), so that thereafter it read:\n5(1) \"Income\" as hereinbefore defined shall for the purposes of this Act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions:\u2014\n(a) The Minister in determining the income derived from mining * * * may make such an allowance * * *\nIn respect of the assessments for 1940 and 1941, the Minister proceeded upon the same view of the Statute as already described, but because of the fact that the royalties received by the Tantramar Company were less than the full amount of depletion allowance allotted to the mine in these years, appellant was allotted the surplus as a deduction. It is this fact alone which gives plausibility to the contention made on behalf of the respondent that the decision of the Minister in connection with the allowances for these years is conclusive and not the subject of appeal. These allowances however, were not made in exercise of the power given to the Minister under the section to apportion as between lessor and lessee but only because the Tantramar Company did not have enough income to absorb them. The letter of January 14, 1948, previously referred to, is express on the point. It says:\nYour company is being allowed depletion to the extent that it has not been claimed by the Tantramar company.\nIt is therefore plain to my mind that with respect to the later years, as well as with respect to 1939, the decision of the Minister was based on the same erroneous view in law of the position of the appellant. As the latter did not act in accordance with the Statute he may not invoke it to preclude the appeal provided for by sections 58 and 60.\nThe alternative allegation in the statement of defence should be mentioned. It alleges that if the appellant were a lessee within the meaning of the section \"which the respondent does not admit but denies\", the Minister has properly apportioned the depletion allowance between the appellant and Tantramar. This cannot, in my opinion, avail the respondent. As already pointed out, he did not make any apportionment at all in the exercise of his statutory power. The alternative plea in the respondent's defence has therefore no relevancy as it has no foundation in fact in anything which the Minister did or purported to do under the statute.\nIn Fraser's case (supra) their Lordships had to consider the statute as it stood after the 1940 amendment. It was there held that the Minister has a two-fold discretion under the section, first, to determine whether the case is one for an allowance for depletion, and, second, if so, to determine how much should be allowed. In the present case the Minister has exercised the first head of his discretion, as already mentioned, by determining that ten cents per ton was to be allowed for depletion in respect of the mine.\nAs to the second head, their Lordships held that the Minister must proceed on \"just, reasonable and admissible grounds\". In defining this discretion their Lordships said at page 36:\nThe criteria by which the exercise of a statutory discretion must be judged have been defined in many authoritative cases, and it is well settled that if the discretion has been exercised bona fide, uninfluenced by irrevelant considerations and not arbitrarily or illegally, no court is entitled to interfere even if the court, had the discretion been theirs, might have exercised it otherwise.\nIn the case at bar the Minister acted with respect to the years 1940 and 1941 as with respect to 1939 on the irrelevant consideration that the appellant had no standing as a lessee under the section. Had he not been mistaken in his view as to the legal position of the appellant and the Tantramar Company and had apportioned the depletion allowance as between them as lessor and lessee, it might have been that Mr. MacQuarrie's argument that no appeal lay from the Minister's decision would have been well taken. That point need not be decided in the present case as in my view it does not arise on the facts. He did not do that. I think therefore, that as in the case of the 1939 assessment, the appeal with respect to the assessments for the later years must also be allowed and the matter referred back to be dealt with in accordance with these reasons.\nWhen the matter was reviewed by the Minister, all the relevant facts for the statutory apportionment were in the material before him. It was shown, contrary to the contention of the respondent, which was given effect to by the learned trial judge, that there had been a capital consideration paid by the appellant to Winfield in the issue of 747 paid up shares of the appellant company for the assignment to the appellant of the interests here in question and other property, and in the balance sheet of the appellant a value of $70,700 was placed on its \"coal leaseholds\". The appellant also invested other amounts in the development of the mine in respect of some of which no allowance, such as depreciation, appears to have been made. Amounts invested would ordinarily be one of the relevant matters for consideration in making the allowance for depletion, but would not necessarily be the only consideration.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

Cette r\u00e9solution \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'effet que les deux enfants de l'appelant \u00e9taient \"renvoy\u00e9s d\u00e9finitivement des \u00e9coles de la municipalit\u00e9 pour cause d'incapacit\u00e9 de suivre les cours\". Les intim\u00e9s ont plaid\u00e9, entre autres, que les deux enfants de l'appelant sont arri\u00e9r\u00e9s mentalement au point de ne pouvoir suivre les cours de la toute premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e; qu'ils sont insubordonn\u00e9s et, \u00e0 cause de leur insubordination, ils emp\u00eachent les institutrices des intim\u00e9s de donner les cours que les autres \u00e9l\u00e8ves pourraient suivre, causant ainsi un pr\u00e9judice consid\u00e9rable \u00e0 l'avancement des autres \u00e9l\u00e8ves.\nLe jugement de premi\u00e8re instance, tout en admettant qu'il \u00e9tait apparent que les deux enfants en question \u00e9taient mentalement arri\u00e9r\u00e9s, au point que, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 cinq ans \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole, ils en \u00e9taient encore au premier cours et que leurs t\u00e9moignages au proc\u00e8s indiquent des enfants bien audessous de la normale, fut d'avis que les intim\u00e9s avaient failli dans leur preuve de d\u00e9montrer que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves en question \u00e9taient \"habituellement insubordonn\u00e9s\", suivant leur all\u00e9gation, et que, par cons\u00e9quent, ils n'avaient pu justifier le renvoi de ces \u00e9l\u00e8ves.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) 2 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis que le jugement lui-m\u00eame de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure d\u00e9montrait \"qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 ses admissions et qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la preuve faite en cette cause, il n'est pas possible de conclure au maintien de ce bref de mandamus\", et le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance a, en cons\u00e9quence, \u00e9t\u00e9 mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nNous sommes d'avis que ce dernier jugement doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9.\nSans doute, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le jugement du tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance sur une question de fait poss\u00e8de un poids consid\u00e9rable et qu'un tribunal d'appel ne devrait pas mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 sans des raisons s\u00e9rieuses. Mais, ici, nous ne pouvons en venir \u00e0 une autre conclusion que celle que la Cour d'Appel \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e d'infirmer le jugement dont est appel, m\u00eame sur les faits.\nSans entrer dans la discussion d\u00e9taill\u00e9e de l'enqu\u00eate\u2014et, entre autres raisons, agissant ainsi par un souci de d\u00e9licatesse \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des enfants et de leurs parents\u2014nous trouvons que la preuve est surabondante en faveur de la pr\u00e9tention des intim\u00e9s, que les \u00e9l\u00e8ves en question \u00e9taient \"habituellement insubordonn\u00e9s\", au sens de l'article 221, para. 14, de la Loi de l'Instruction publique (S.R. 1941, c. 59). Cela ressort \u00e0 la fois du t\u00e9moignage de leur insti- tutrice et du t\u00e9moignage des autres \u00e9l\u00e8ves, qui ont pu rapporter des faits d\u00e9taill\u00e9s, et dont les plus caract\u00e9ristiques sont r\u00e9cit\u00e9s au long dans le jugement tr\u00e8s \u00e9labor\u00e9 de l'honorable juge Saint-Germain, auquel tous les autres juges de la Cour d'Appel se sont ralli\u00e9s. Il faut avouer que toute cette preuve est aussi convaincante qu'elle pouvait \u00eatre, et il n'est pas \u00e9tonnant que le docteur Georges Samson, appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin de l'appelant, ait conclu son t\u00e9moignage en disant qu'il vaudrait mieux mettre ces enfants \"dans une institution sp\u00e9ciale\"; \u2026 \"que, manifestement, d'apr\u00e8s son opinion personnelle, il ne les laisserait pas \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole de Dixville\", et, il ajoute: \"\u00c7'a une mauvaise influence sur les autres enfants. Si c'\u00e9tait mes enfants je ne le ferais pas\" (voulant dire, d'apr\u00e8s le texte, que, s'il avait des enfants comme ceux dont il s'agit, il ne les laisserait pas \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole de Dixville).\nMais il n'y a pas que la surabondance de la preuve qui justifiait la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) d'approuver la conduite des intim\u00e9s.\nEn tout respect, nous devons dire que le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance n'a pas abord\u00e9 la cause comme elle devait l'\u00eatre.\nApr\u00e8s avoir dit que les activit\u00e9s des enfants de l'appelant ajout\u00e9es \u00e0 la distraction que leurs r\u00e9ponses aux interrogatoires causaient aux autres \u00e9l\u00e8ves dans la classe, et que tout cela, \u00e9videmment, rendait la t\u00e2che de l'institutrice tr\u00e8s difficile, il ins\u00e8re dans son jugement le consid\u00e9rant suivant:\nTo deny the right of a child to attend the public schools of this Province, the insubordination would have to be of a very grave character and then if it was habitual expulsion would be justified.\nA notre sens, le passage du jugement indique la mentalit\u00e9 avec laquelle l'honorable juge a envisag\u00e9 cette cause. Il s'est inspir\u00e9 davantage de l'article qui oblige les commissaires d'\u00e9coles \u00e0 admettre chaque enfant qui est domicili\u00e9 dans la municipalit\u00e9 scolaire, depuis l'\u00e2ge de cinq ans jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de seize ans (art. 69 de la Loi de l'Instruction publique, tel qu'amend\u00e9 par l'article 2, du chapitre 13, Statut 7, George VI), plut\u00f4t que du paragraphe 14 de l'article 221, auquel nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait allusion. Il est \u00e9vident que si, d'une part, les commissaires d'\u00e9coles doivent admettre tous les enfants de la municipalit\u00e9\u2014ce qui est la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2014c'est \u00e9galement leur devoir \"de renvoyer de l'\u00e9cole les \u00e9l\u00e8ves habituellement insubordonn\u00e9s, ou dont la conduite est immorale en paroles ou en actions\" (art. 221, par. 14). Et, dans toutes ces questions administratives, il est de r\u00e8gle qu'une large discr\u00e9tion doit \u00eatre laiss\u00e9e aux commissaires d'\u00e9coles de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que, pour les conseillers municipaux, il est de jurisprudence de ne pas intervenir dans leurs d\u00e9cisions, \u00e0 moins d'y d\u00e9couvrir un parti-pris ou une injustice manifeste, ou, bien entendu, une irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 ou une ill\u00e9galit\u00e9.\nNous croyons donc que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a pos\u00e9 la question d'une fa\u00e7on erron\u00e9e en disant qu'il fallait trouver ici, pour justifier la r\u00e9solution des commissaires d'\u00e9coles, une insubordination \"of a very grave character\".\nComme dans tous les cas de cette nature, les conseillers municipaux et les commissaires d'\u00e9coles sont \u00e9videmment les premiers juges et les tribunaux doivent \u00e9viter de substituer \u00e0 la leur l'appr\u00e9ciation des circonstances qui ont entour\u00e9 leur d\u00e9cision.\nSans doute, il est d'un int\u00e9r\u00eat primordial de ne pas priver les enfants de l'instruction \u00e0 laquelle ils ont droit; mais il est \u00e9galement n\u00e9cessaire pour la bonne administration municipale ou scolaire que ceux qui en sont charg\u00e9s, conseillers municipaux ou commissaires d'\u00e9coles, ne soient pas entrav\u00e9s dans l'exercice de leur devoir par l'intervention des cours de justice, except\u00e9 pour des raisons graves\u2014ce qui est l'inverse de ce que semble avoir envisag\u00e9 l'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance.\nEt cela est d'autant plus important qu'il s'agit ici d'un mandamus, c'est-\u00e0-dire, d'un bref qui, en vertu de l'article 992 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile, ne peut \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9 que \"lorsqu'il n'y a pas d'autre rem\u00e8de \u00e9galement appropri\u00e9, avantageux et efficace\"; et, en plus, o\u00f9 la r\u00e8gle est suivant High's Extraordinary Legal Remedies (3rd Ed., pages 15 and 16):\u2014\nTo warrant a court in granting a mandamus, it must be shown first that the petitioner has a clear legal right to the performance of a particular act or duty at the hands of the respondent. Il reste seulement \u00e0 signaler que l'appelant a fait valoir le point suivant:\nLa r\u00e9solution des intim\u00e9s d\u00e9clare que les deux enfants sont renvoy\u00e9s d\u00e9finitivement des \u00e9coles de la municipalit\u00e9 \"pour cause d'incapacit\u00e9 de suivre les cours\". D'autre part, le plaidoyer \u00e9crit des intim\u00e9s invoque, comme raison de la d\u00e9cision qu'ils ont prise, que les enfants \"sont arri\u00e9r\u00e9s mentalement au point de ne pouvoir suivre les cours de la toute premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e; qu'ils sont insubordonn\u00e9s et, \u00e0 cause de leur insubordination, ils emp\u00eachent les institutrices des intim\u00e9s de donner les cours que les autres \u00e9l\u00e8ves pourraient suivre, causant ainsi un pr\u00e9judice consid\u00e9rable \u00e0 l'avancement de l'instruction des autres enfants\".\nL'appelant a pr\u00e9tendu, au cours de son argumentation devant cette Cour, que les intim\u00e9s \u00e9taient limit\u00e9s \u00e0 la cause mentionn\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9solution et qu'ils ne pouvaient ainsi y ajouter d'autres causes dans leur plaidoirie \u00e9crite.\nNous ne pouvons nous rendre \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9tention. Il est tr\u00e8s clair que toute l'enqu\u00eate a roul\u00e9 sur l'existence des diff\u00e9rentes causes invoqu\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9fense.\nLa v\u00e9ritable mani\u00e8re de soulever ce point, s'il \u00e9tait s\u00e9rieux, eut \u00e9t\u00e9 pour l'appelant de faire ab initio une motion pour faire rejeter l'all\u00e9gation d'autre cause que celle qui se trouvait dans la r\u00e9solution.\nA d\u00e9faut de cette motion, l'all\u00e9gation est rest\u00e9e dans le plaidoyer \u00e9crit et, \u00e9videmment, l'enqu\u00eate devait porter sur cette all\u00e9gation. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, dans son jugement, s'est content\u00e9 d'\u00e9mettre un doute sur le droit des intim\u00e9s de faire valoir d'autres moyens que celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans la r\u00e9solution.\nLa Cour d'Appel, au contraire, a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que, ce qui importait pour la d\u00e9cision du litige, ce n'\u00e9tait pas les termes dont les commissaires d'\u00e9coles se sont servis pour exprimer le motif de leur d\u00e9cision, mais, plut\u00f4t, la suffisance du motif qu'ils ont invoqu\u00e9 dans leur d\u00e9fense et la preuve qu'ils en ont faite.\nNous ne croyons pas que ce moyen de l'appelant soit de la nature de ceux dont la Cour Supr\u00eame doive se pr\u00e9occuper apr\u00e8s que le plus haut tribunal de la province s'est prononc\u00e9 l\u00e0-dessus. Il y a l\u00e0, semble-t-il, beaucoup plus une question de pratique et de proc\u00e9dure qu'une question de droit substantiel.\nD'autre part, l'ensemble des jugements des membres de la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) se r\u00e9sume certainement dans ce passage des notes de l'honorable juge Bissonnette:\nQuel sens faut-il donner \u00e0 l'incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 suivre les cours, si ce n'est l'inaptitude \u00e0 se soumettre aux r\u00e8glements de l'\u00e9cole. Pour ma part, je ne puis en d\u00e9couvrir un autre.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Kellock and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau, J.:\u2014L'appelant, requ\u00e9rant devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, a obtenu l'\u00e9mission d'un bref de mandamus, afin de contraindre la Corporation d\u00e9fenderesse de recevoir ses deux enfants d'\u00e2ge scolaire, \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole de l'arrondissement D, de St-Mathieu-de-Dixville, d'o\u00f9 ils auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement expuls\u00e9s.\nM. le Juge Campbell, si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Sherbrooke, a accueilli cette demande, mais la Cour d'Appel l'a rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nLe 29 septembre 1947, l'appelant a re\u00e7u du Secr\u00e9taire-Tr\u00e9sorier de l'intim\u00e9e la lettre suivante:\nM. Joseph Bouchard Dixville le 29 jour septembre 1947\nDixville\nMonsieur\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solu unanimement \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re s\u00e9ance tenue dimanche le 28 septembre 1947 que vos deux enfants Rodolphe et Robert soit renvoy\u00e9 d\u00e9finitivement des \u00e9coles de la municipalit\u00e9 pour cause d'incapacit\u00e9 de suivre les cours.\nEt que vos deux autres Gilbert et Gilberte soit retir\u00e9es de l'\u00e9cole N\u00b0 2 St Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, et transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole N\u00b0 1 du Christ Roi dans votre arrondissement.\nPar ordre des commissaires.\nP. E. JODOIN,\nsec. tr\u00e8s.\nLa r\u00e9solution n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produite, mais personne ne conteste que cette lettre repr\u00e9sente bien la teneur v\u00e9ritable de la d\u00e9cision des commissaires. C'est quelques jours apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u cet avis que l'appelant a institu\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures judiciaires.\nEn vertu de l'article 69 de la Loi de l'Instruction Publique, telle qu'amend\u00e9e en 1943, les Commissaires d'Ecoles sont tenus d'admettre tout enfant d'\u00e2ge scolaire, domicili\u00e9 dans la municipalit\u00e9, mais l'article 221, para. 14, leur permet de renvoyer de l'\u00e9cole ceux qui sont \"habituellement insubordonn\u00e9s\" ou dont \"la conduite est immorale en paroles ou en actions\". C'est ce dernier article que la d\u00e9fenderesse invoque pour demander le rejet du pr\u00e9sent appel. Elle all\u00e8gue sp\u00e9cialement que les deux enfants du requ\u00e9rant sont \"arri\u00e9r\u00e9s mentalement\", \"qu'ils ne peuvent, suivre les cours\", \"qu'ils sont insubordonn\u00e9s\", et qu'\u00e0 cause de leur condition mentale et de leur insubordination, ils nuisent au bon ordre de la classe, et \u00e0 l'avancement des autres \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Ce plaidoyer contient des raisons de justification plus \u00e9labor\u00e9es que celle contenue dans la lettre du 29 septembre 1947, o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait dit que la cause du renvoi \u00e9tait \"l'incapacit\u00e9 de suivre les cours\", mais je ne crois pas que l'insuffisance de raison dans le premier avis emp\u00eache la d\u00e9fenderesse-intim\u00e9e d'invoquer tous les motifs l\u00e9gaux qui ont pu justifier l'expulsion.\nLa preuve \u00e9tablit surabondamment que les enfants du requ\u00e9rant sont malheureusement des \"arri\u00e9r\u00e9s mentaux\" et que leur \"insubordination habituelle\" est un obstacle \u00e0 la discipline de la classe. Par leur conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible que les autorit\u00e9s scolaires ont tol\u00e9r\u00e9e pendant plusieurs ann\u00e9es, ces enfants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 une s\u00e9rieuse cause de trouble que les commissaires ont non seulement le droit, mais l'imp\u00e9rieux devoir de r\u00e9primer. Charg\u00e9s de l'instruction et de l'\u00e9ducation d'un grand nombre de jeunes enfants, ils ne peuvent \u00e9videmment pas permettre que par l'insubordination de quelques-uns, qui exigerait la vigilance constante de la ma\u00eetresse, l'attention des autres \u00e9l\u00e8ves soit d\u00e9tourn\u00e9e de leurs \u00e9tudes. Comme d'autres t\u00e9moins, mademoiselle La-montagne, leur ma\u00eetresse, dit qu'ils sont des \"arri\u00e9r\u00e9s mentaux\", \"des insubordonn\u00e9s\", qu'ils sont des \"causes de d\u00e9sordre\", qu'ils \"en causaient continuellement\", et M. le Docteur Samson, t\u00e9moin de l'appelant, qui a examin\u00e9 ces deux jeunes enfants, est d'opinion qu'ils sont des \"arri\u00e9r\u00e9s mentaux\", et dit que s'ils \u00e9taient ses propres enfants, il ne \"les garderait pas \u00e0 la classe\", \"que \u00e7a a une mauvaise influence sur les autres enfants\". Je partage l'opinion de la Cour d'Appel que les Commissaires \u00e9taient justifi\u00e9s d'expulser ces deux \u00e9l\u00e8ves de la classe, et l'appel doit en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the Appellant: Samson & G\u00e9rin.\nSolicitors for the Respondents: Veilleux & P\u00e9loquin.\n1 Q.R.

When in a position to deliver them, they were instructed by respondent to sell 250 of the shares and to apply the proceeds toward the purchase price of the 750. This sale was done, and, at the request of respondent, the remaining 500 shares were delivered to him and the account was then determined and paid before the 250 shares were delivered to and paid for by the buyer of the same on the New York Stock Exchange. A modification of the exchange rate of the dollar taking place after determination of the account and before such delivery and payment resulted in a loss for appellants which they seeked to recover from respondent. The action was maintained in the Superior Court but dismissed in the Court of Appeal. Held: The contract between the parties being clearly in the nature of a mandate, appellants therefore are entitled to recover the loss incurred during the execution of the mandate as the result of unforeseeable changes in the exchange rate, since a mandatary should not be impoverished by the due execution of his mandate.\nHeld: As the mandate could only come to an end after delivery and payment were made on the sale of the 250 shares, the settlement made prior to that time could not be more than provisional.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, reversing the decision of the Superior Court maintaining an action to recover losses incurred by a broker in the execution of transactions for a client.\nRoger Cordeau for the appellants.\nHazen Hansard, K.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFauteux, J.:\u2014The essential facts of this case are not disputed and are substantially stated as follows by the Trial Judge:\u2014\nOn the 1st of July 1946, the Respondent, who describes himself as an investment dealer, decided to purchase shares of the International Paper Company, a company whose stock is listed on both the Montreal and 'the New York Stock Exchanges. It being \"Dominion Day\", the Montreal Stock Exchange was closed. The Respondent was aware that under the Regulations of the Foreign Exchange Control Board, he could not purchase shares in New York without United States currency. He had also seen a notice in the Montreal Daily Star in which the Appellants advertised that they could provide facilities for the purchase of American stocks under said Regulations. Thereupon, the Respondent called on one MacKinnon, co-manager of the Appellants' Montreal office, and placed an order for the purchase of 500 shares of International Paper Company and later, on the same day, another order to purchase 250 more shares of the said stock. As a result, on the 1st of July 1946, the Appellants purchased 750 shares of International Paper Company common stock on the New York Stock Exchange in their own name, but for the benefit of the Respondent. According to Rule 109 of the New York Stock Exchange, in force on the 1st of July 1946, the delivery of the shares would be made \"on the second full business day following the day of the contract.\" That would be the 3rd of July, 1946. The Respondent having instructed MacKinnon to deliver these shares to the Canadian Bank of Commerce, L. J. Swinburne, the Security clerk in the Appellant's employ, telephoned the bank on the 3rd of July 1946 and was told that no instructions had been received to take delivery of the securities for the Respondent. On the same day, 3rd of July 1946, the Respondent telephoned MacKinnon stating that he had decided to take up only 500 shares and instructed him to sell the remaining 250 shares and to credit the proceeds thereon on account of the purchase price of the 750 shares. Accordingly, 250 shares were sold that date for the sum of $11,572.54 in United States currency. On the same 3rd of July 1946, the Respondent and William Goldburn, the Appellant's office manager, had a conversation over the telephone; and the 250 shares having been sold, the Respondent says he was desirous of closing the transaction on that date. They together, over the telephone, checked the figures. Purchase price of the 750 shares, including the brokers' commission and the premium of United States currency amounted to $39,966.28, of which the Appellants' manager gave the Respondent credit for $12,729.79, being the proceeds of the sale of the said 250 shares in Canadian currency, leaving a net balance due by the Respondent of $27,236.49 which the Respondent paid and took delivery for the 500 shares. But, on the 3rd of July, 1946, when that alleged settlement was made, the Appellants had not yet been paid for the said 250 shares by the purchaser on the New York Stock Exchange. The 3rd of July 1946 was a Wednesday, and it is admitted that on Thursday, the 4th of July, being a United States holiday, the New York Stock Exchange was closed. Friday, the 5th of July, was then the first \"full business day following the day of the contract\" which was related to the sale of the 250 shares. Saturday, 6th of July, and Sunday, the 7th of July, the New York Stock Exchange was also closed. So that, according to the Rules of the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, the 8th of July, 1946, was the first day on which the purchaser of the 250 shares could be compelled to take delivery and pay the price of the same. Meanwhile, in the evening of Friday, 5th July 1946, the Canadian currency had been brought to a parity with the United States currency. As a result of this change in the value of the two currencies, $11,572.54 United States currency did no longer amount to $12,729.79, but was then worth only 10% less, that is a difference of $1,157.25 which the Appellants seek to recover from the Respondent.\nThe Respondent urged three points. He first says that the original purchase by the Appellants in their own name, of the 750 shares and the subsequent sale by the Appellants of 250 of them were all part and parcel of one single modified transaction by which the Respondent bought from the Appellants as principals, 500 shares of the stock in question and the Respondent being entitled to assume, as he did, that the Appellants were acting as principals throughout, that the operations conducted by them on the New York Stock Exchange were for their own account and that it was up to them to protect themselves in respect of the exchange premium. The Respondent further urges that the settlement reached between the parties on the 3rd of July was final and intended to be so by both parties. And, finally, the Respondent contends that if the Appellants were acting as his mandataries in disposing of the 250 shares, they failed to execute their mandate with the reasonable skill and care of a prudent administrator by not protecting the mandator in respect of the exchange premium.\nThese submissions were not accepted by the Trial Judge who maintained the action of the Appellants for $1,155.43, being the amount claimed through error by the Appellants instead of $1,157.25.\nThis judgment of the Trial Court was reversed in Appeal 2 by a majority judgment now before us for review.\nThe judgment appealed from contains only two reasons. One held by one of the Judges of the majority is formulated as follows:\u2014\nThe agreement of July 3rd, 1946, was final and complete as between the parties and the loss suffered consequently must be borne by Respondents. (The Appellants herein.)\nThe second reason formulated by the two other Judges of the majority reads:\u2014\nThat there existed facilities whereby the loss of the premium could have been avoided and that since Respondents\u2014\n(The Appellants herein)\u2014\nmust be presumed to have had knowledge of these facilities, their failure without reason to make use of them prior to the close of business on July 5th amounts to a negligence of sufficient gravity to engage their responsibility for the loss thereby incurred.\nThe whole transaction, purchase as well as sale of these shares, were made by the Appellants in performance of the Respondent's instructions which they had accepted, and was carried on in the ordinary course of the business in which they were engaged. The contract between the parties is clearly of the nature of a mandate (1701, C.C.). That the Appellants have, by reason of the Foreign Exchange Control Board Regulations, acted as principals with respect to the party from whom they purchased the 750 shares on the New York Stock Exchange, does not change the nature of their contractual relations with the Respondent.\nAt the relevant time, Rule 109 of the Rules of the Board of the New York Stock Exchange made a distinction between a \"cash transaction\" and a \"transaction in the regular way.\" In the case of the former, the delivery date was the very day of the contract whereas, in the case of the latter, it was the second full business day following the date of the contract. Furthermore, and under the same rule, a transaction was presumed to be a \"transaction in the regular way\" unless otherwise specified. The Appellants who were brokers, and known as such by the Respondent, were by the same mandate given authority to do, what they were asked to do, in the ordinary course of the business they followed. Such authority is inferred by law (1706, C.C.). And if need be, reference may be had to the fact that the Respondent, describing himself as an investment dealer, and who, it was admitted before us, was equally associated with another brokers' firm, cannot and did not disclaim knowledge of such ordinary course in which the business committed by him to the Appellants was to be carried on, and by his failure to otherwise specify, he accepted the same. The Judicial Committee held in Forget v. Baxter 3 that:\u2014 When one employs a broker to do business on a Stock Exchange he should, in the absence of anything to shew the contrary, be taken to have employed the broker on the terms of the Stock Exchange.\nThe relevant transaction being a \"transaction in the regular way\", the delivery date of the 250 shares sold by the Respondent through the Appellants, on the New York Stock Exchange, on the 3rd of July 1946, was, in the circumstances and for the reasons indicated above, on the 8th of July, 1946. It is then only on or from that date that the purchaser of these shares in New York could be compelled to take delivery and make payment, and only on or from that date that the mandate committed to the Appellants by the Respondent could, after and subject to the proper fulfilment or liquidation of the purchaser's obligations, come to an end. In the meantime, all the obligations contracted by the Appellants for the Respondent, within the mandate, were the latter's obligations.\nHowever, five days previous to that date, the Respondent wanted to take delivery of the 500 shares and at his request, for his accommodation, and without any obligation on their part and, evidently, with no intention of jeopardizing any of their rights, the Appellants indicated to him in a telephone conversation, the then position of the account, delivered the 500 shares on payment of the assumed amount of the balance. On the occasion, there was no reference as to what remained to be done to perfect the execution of the mandate. Further contractual obligations, related to both parties and to the very essence of the mandate, were still outstanding. In point of fact, it is established that the delivery and the payment of the 250 shares took place in New York on the 8th of July, 1946; this being the normal course of business implicitly agreed upon by the Respondent.\nThat the mandatary must not enrich himself beyond the consideration agreed and must not be impoverished by the due execution of the mandate is a general and fundamental principle (1713, 1725, C.C.). As pointed out by one of the learned Judges of the minority, if one is to accept the alleged settlement as final, the two results indicated above would have obtained: the first one, had the value of Canadian currency been decreased instead of being increased, and the second one, had the purchaser of the 250 shares failed to take delivery or make payment. There is no evidence that the parties ever intended to deviate from these paramount principles nor can such intention be inferred from the circumstances in which the Appellants were called by the Respondent to accommodate him. On the contrary, the latter, well aware that the perfection of the execution of the mandate was not yet achieved and was still conditioned by the subsequent delivery and payment of the shares, made no reference to this fact and said nothing to nullify or minimize the relevant obligations of the parties hereto. To say that this settlement was anything more than provisional, I am, with deference, unable to do.\nAs to the alleged negligence of the Appellants to protect the exchange position, I think it is manifest from the circumstances in this case that neither of the parties, the mandator, or the mandatary, directed their mind to the matter, on the occasion. The Respondent's witness, E. A. Robson, in charge of the Foreign Exchange Control Department of the Royal Bank of Canada,\u2014authorized dealers under the Regulations and, besides, the very bankers of the Appellants,\u2014admits that \"the change was not foreseen by anyone\"\u2026, \"that it came as quite a surprise\"\u2026, \"that the Appellants could not have foreseen it.\" That there were facilities to protect the exchange position is established. The record also shows that the procedure devised to that end and indicated in a circular letter proven to have been addressed several months previously, to the banks,\u2014but not to brokers,\u2014was not recommended or resorted to in practise. Once being appraised of the change and of its nature, it becomes easy for the Respondent to think of protection and, thus, formulate the above argument. Speculation is not necessary to envisage how the Respondent's contention would have been formulated had the value of Canadian currency been decreased, instead of being increased, and had the Appellants frozen the exchange position by any method, without being so instructed by the Respondent. And it cannot be stated that such authority \"to protect\" could be inferred from the circumstances of the provisional settlement. There was no law, and no custom, or instructions proved to suggest the existence of an obligation for the Appellants to \"protect the exchange position.\" (Barthelmes v. Bickell and others). The fact that the Appellants advertised that they were providing \"facilities for the purchase of American stocks\" has no relevancy to the point in issue.\nUnder the circumstances of this case, I am of the opinion that this appeal should be maintained, that the judgment of the Court of the King's Bench (Appeal side) rendered on the 28th of February, 1949, should be reversed and that the judgment of the Superior Court, rendered on June 18, 1947, condemning the Respondent to pay to the Appellants the sum of $1,155.43 with interest from the 8th of July, 1946, and costs be restored; with costs here and in the Court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the Appellants: Heward, Holden, Hutchison, Cliff, Meredith & Ballantyne.\nSolicitors for the Respondent: Montgomery, McMichael, Common, Howard, Forsyth & Ker.\n1 Q.R.

On premises, leased for a ten-year period, it erected a frame building in the basement of which it installed a transformer and on the first floor a transmitter. Each rested by its own weight only on the respective floors. The power required for broadcasting was carried from high voltage lines into the building to the transformer, by further wires to the transmitter, and thence by the same means to exterior broadcasting towers. A clause in the lease permitted the removal by the lessee of all buildings, fixtures and structures erected on the land. The respondent assessed both the transformer and transmitter under the general heading of \u201cmachinery and equipment\u201d. The assessment was appealed on the ground that neither the transformer nor the transmitter constitute \u201cland\u201d, \u201creal property\u201d or \u201creal estate\u201d within the meaning of s. 1 (1) (iv) of the Assessment Act which provides that: \u201c\u2018Land\u2019, \u2018real property\u2019, and \u2018real estate\u2019 shall include: All buildings, or any part of any building, and all structures, machinery and fixtures erected or placed upon, in, under, or affixed to land.\u201d\nHeld: Affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, [1949] O.R. 695, Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin J., dissenting, that both the transformer and transmitter were \u201cland\u201d within the meaning of the Statute and therefore assessable.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, Aylesworth J.A. dissenting[1], affirming a decision of the Ontario Municipal Board whereby the transformer and transmitter of the appellant was found to be assessable under the Assessment Act.\nH.E. Manning K.C. and Allan D. Rogers for the appellant.\nD.D. Carrick and S.A. Gillies for the respondent.\nThe dissenting judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J. was delivered by:\nKERWIN J.: By leave of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, Northern Broadcasting Company Limited appeals against a judgment of that Court confirming an assessment made by the Ontario Municipal Board upon an appeal to it by the Company under the provisions of the Ontario Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 272.\nThe Company had previously operated a broadcasting system in Timmins, Ontario, but, in 1947, in accordance with prescribed regulations of the Department of Transport, it moved part of its system to a point some distance away in the Improvement District of Mountjoy. The Company there leased land for a period of ten years with successive rights of renewal for one year to a total of four, and upon it erected three towers and a frame main building containing a basement, a first floor, and residential accommodation for the resident engineer and his wife on the second floor. The Company\u2019s programmes originate in its studios in Timmins and are fed on special telephone wires to the new location and put into a transmitter and onto the towers which radiate the signal.\nA transformer was brought into the main building after the latter\u2019s completion and there is a voltage regulator beside it on a wooden base, both of which are movable. The transformer, which is an integral part of the transmitter, is located in the basement and, as required by law, is installed in a concrete vault. The transformer rests on the floor and from it wires run through a conduit pipe projecting through the ceiling of the basement to connect with the hydro wires outside the building. Electrical power is fed through these lines to the transformer, which steps the voltage received down to that required by the transmitter.\nThe transformer is connected with the transmitter by wires which penetrate the ceiling of the basement. The transmitter is entirely demountable, having been brought in in sections. It is situated on the first floor of the main building and rests on a linoleum covering on the wooden floor. For its own protection and that of personnel, it is surrounded by a wire screen which is bolted to the floor and which at first was screwed to the top of the transmitter. At the time of the hearing before the Board the screws had been removed as they were not required but the bottom of the screen remained bolted to the floor. The transmitter is connected to the towers by No. 8 wires of six strands which constitute a transmission line suspended on poles. The connection of the wires to the transmitter is the ordinary connection and can be changed or moved.\nAll of this is what is described as \u201ca tailor-made job\u201d, which, however, means only that it was done according to the specifications of the company\u2019s president and the engineers of the manufacturers of the equipment. The buildings are not substantial and it is expected that the towers, wires (or ground system), transmitter and transformer, will be obsolete before the expiration of the leases held by the Company. Under those leases the latter may remove any building, fixture or structures erected by it on the land.\nThe Company was assessed on behalf of the District in 1948 for taxation in 1949 at $100 for land and $27,500 for buildings. It appears that the assessor made up the latter sum by placing on the main building a value of $7,200; on the towers, a value of $3,000; on the ground system of wires, $1,200; on the transmitter, $15,600; and on the transformer $500. This assessment having been confirmed by the Court of Revision and the Company having appealed to the Board, the latter altered the assessment to $2,500 for the building and $11,000 for the towers, ground system, transmitter and transformer under the general heading of \u201cmachinery and equipment\u201d. The Company\u2019s appeal to the Court of Appeal was restricted to the last item and it did not there allege, as it did not before this Court, that the towers and ground system were not assessable. That leaves for consideration the transmitter and transformer.\nBefore referring to the relevant provisions of the present Ontario Assessment Act, the well-known fact should be noticed that prior to The Assessment Act of 1904 both real and personal property were assessable. By section 2(9) of the previous Act, R.S.O. 1897, c. 224, it was provided in part that \u201c\u2018Land,\u2019 \u2018real property\u2019 and \u2018real estate\u2019\u201d respectively, shall include all buildings or other things erected upon or affixed to the land, and all machinery or other things so fixed to any building as to form in law part of the realty.\u201d By the 1904 Assessment Act, personal property ceased to be liable to assessment but the definition section omitted the words underlined and inserted the word \u201cplaced\u201d. These changes have been carried forward to section 1 (i) of the present Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1937:\n\u201cLand\u201d, \u201creal property\u201d and \u201creal estate\u201d shall include:\n* * *\n(iv) All buildings, or any part of any building, and all structures, machinery and fixtures erected or placed upon, in, over, under, or affixed to land:\n* * *\nSection 4 as amended, 1947, c. 3, s. 4(17) provides:\nAll real property in Ontario * * * shall be liable to taxation subject to the following exemptions:\n* * *\n17. All fixed machinery used for manufacturing or farming purposes including the foundations on which the same rests; but not fixed machinery used, intended or required for the production or supply of motive power including boilers and engines, gas, electric and other motors, nor machinery owned, operated or used by a transportation system or by a person having the right, authority or permission to construct, maintain or operate within Ontario in, under, above, on or through any highway, lane or other public communication, public place or public water, any structure or other thing, for the purposes of a bridge or transportation system, or for the purpose of conducting steam, heat, water, gas, oil, electricity or any property, substance or product capable of transportation, transmission or conveyance for the supply of water, light, heat, power, or other service.\nUnder this legislation, Hope J.A. in the present case, held that the transformer and transmitter fell within the statutory definition of \u201creal property\u201d as machinery placed upon land. Laidlaw J.A., agreed but added: \u201cWhile in one sense the transformer and transmitter are movables they are nevertheless integral parts of the broadcasting plant. There was no intention whatsoever on the part of the owners when they installed those items of equipment, or at any time afterwards, to regard them as chattels but rather as part and parcel of the real property.\u201d Aylesworth J.A. dissented, being of opinion that the intention was to install the transformer and transmitter where they were installed for their beneficial and convenient use as machines and for no other purpose, relying upon the decisions of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Re City of Ottawa and Ottawa Electric Railway Co.[2], and in Re Ford Motor Co. of Canada, Ltd. and Town of Ford City[3].\nThe first of these cases was concerned with an agreement between the City of Ottawa and the Electric Railway Company. Rose J. who delivered the judgment on behalf of the Court of Appeal, held that when the question is to determine whether a machine has become part of the realty for the purpose of assessment, the test to be applied is whether the intention is to improve the land, as when a central heating plant is installed, or whether the intention is to put the machine in a place where it can conveniently be used as a machine.\nIn the Ford Motor case, Middleton J.A., delivering the judgment of the Court, first decided that a gantry crane fell within the exemption of \u201cfixed machinery used for manufacturing * * * purposes\u201d, provided for in paragraph 17 of section 4. It was therefore unnecessary, as he pointed out, to determine whether the crane should be regarded as \u201cmachinery and fixtures erected or placed upon * * * or affixed to land,\u201d but he was inclined to think that the crane was chattel property and in that connection adopted the view of Rose J. in the Ottawa case. Without calling upon counsel for the respondent, this Court [1929] S.C.R. 490, dismissed the appeal of the Town of Ford City upon the ground that the crane clearly fell within the exemption.\nIt is not suggested that the case falls within section 4(17) and specifically it is not claimed that the transformer and transmitter are used for manufacuring purposes, but a consideration of the paragraph is of assistance in determining the scope of the definition of real property in section 1 (i). The opening leg of paragraph 17 exempts \u201call fixed machinery used for manufacturing * * * purposes.\u201d On the construction of 1 (i) adopted by the Court of Appeal in the present case, machinery so used but not fixed would be caught by the words \u201cmachinery * * * erected or placed upon, in, over, under, or affixed to land.\u201d With respect, such a construction does not appear to be the proper one.\nI am inclined to the view that the transmitter and transformer are not machinery as held by the Court of Appeal. Where is the line to be drawn? Would such articles as domestic washing machines and sewing machines be included in the term? However, assuming the transformer and transmitter are machines or structures or fixtures, some limitation must be put upon the words \u201cerected or placed upon, in, over, or affixed to land.\u201d The test suggested in the Ottawa Electric case and approved in the Ford Motor case appears to be the proper one.\nWhile, as pointed out by Laidlaw J.A., the transformer and transmitter are integral parts of the broadcasting plant, I am unable to agree with his statement that there was no intention on the part of the owners at any time to regard them as chattels. I think the intention, as evidenced by the terms of the leases of the land by which the Company might remove any building, fixtures or structures erected by it thereon, and also as evidenced by the manner of the placing of the transformer and transmitter on the land exhibit an intention to the contrary, that is, to regard them as chattels. The transformer, the voltage regulator and its base, and the transmitter were installed where they could conveniently be used as chattels.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal. However, the Company does not escape assessment for the towers and ground system. Section 86 of the Assessment Act (made applicable by subsection 3 of section 84 to appeals to the Board) provides for the correction of any omissions or errors in the assessment roll and, as this Court is to give the judgment that should have been given by the Court of Appeal, the matter should be remitted to the Board with a direction to assess, under the head of \u201cValue of Buildings\u201d, the sum of $2,500 already fixed by the Board as the assessable value of the buildings proper, plus a fair and proper assessable value for the towers and ground system.\nThe judgment of Kellock, Cartwright, and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\nKELLOCK J.: The question involved in this appeal is as to whether or not a transformer and a transmitter, located in a building on premises held by the appellant under lease and used for broadcasting purposes constitute \u201cland\u201d, \u201creal property\u201d or \u201creal estate\u201d within the meaning of the Ontario Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 272, s. 1, clause (i), and liable to assessment and taxation as such under the provision of that statute. It is not necessary to repeat the facts, and I accept the finding of the Municipal Board that both are not attached to the building apart from their own weight and the electric wires or conduits originating outside the building and passing to and from each to the broadcasting towers.\nThe statutory definition is as follows:\n1. (i) \u201cland\u201d, \u201creal property\u201d and \u201creal estate\u201d shall include:\n(iv) All buildings, or any part of any building, and all structures, machinery and fixtures erected or placed upon, in, over, under, or affixed to land;\nThe first question calling for consideration is as to whether or not the two items here in question are \u201cmachinery\u201d within the meaning of the Statute. The appellant has referred us to certain dictionary definitions, but apart from the Statute itself, it would be sufficient to refer to one definition given in the Oxford Dictionary:\nAny instrument employed to transmit force or to modify its application.\nAs an illustration, the following is given:\nBy this singular power of transmitting pressure, a fluid becomes, in the strictest sense of the term, a machine.\nI think that both the transformer and the transmitter are within the above definition. They are instruments employed either to transmit force or to modify its application, or both.\nThe Statute, however, furnishes its own dictionary. In paragraph 17 of section 4 which is an exempting provision from the general liability imposed by that section on \u201call real property\u201d in Ontario, it is provided that fixed machinery used for manufacturing or farming purposes is not to be considered \u201cland\u201d, but this does not apply to fixed machinery required for the production or supply of motive power including \u201cboilers.\u201d Mr. Manning contends that unless moving parts are involved, the article, while it may be \u201capparatus\u201d or \u201cequipment\u201d, cannot be a machine. This contention would exclude a boiler which the statute expressly includes. By the same paragraph, the exemption is not to apply to machinery used by certain described persons \u201cfor the purpose of conducting * * * electricity * * * for the supply of power.\u201d A transformer used by a street railway company would clearly fall within this language, as would a transmitter used by a telegraph company. The transformer and the transmitter, therefore, are to be considered machinery within the meaning of the Statute.\nThe second question which arises is as to whether or not a machine merely \u201cplaced\u201d upon land without having acquired the character of land at law, falls within the definition.\nThe Statute took its present form in 1904 by 4 Edward VII, c. 23, s. 2, para. 7(d). Prior to that time, the definition as contained in R.S.O. 1897, c. 224, s. 2, para. 9, was as follows:\n9. \u201cLand\u201d, \u201creal property\u201d and \u201creal estate\u201d respectively, shall include all buildings or other things erected upon or affixed to the land, and all machinery or other things so fixed to any building as to form in law part of the realty * * * The amended Statute of 1904 (now found in R.S.O. 1937, c. 272, s. 1 (i) in common with the present Statute, reads:\nAll buildings, or any part of any building, and all structures, machinery and fixtures erected or placed upon, in, over, under, or affixed to land.\nI am content to assume that the Statute of 1897 was concerned only with fixtures at common law in the sense that they had become part of the realty.\nAppellant says that no change was effected by the Statute of 1904. If this argument be sound, the dropping of the words \u201cso fixed to any building as to form in law part of the realty\u201d as applied to \u201cmachinery\u201d is without significance and the insertion of the word \u201cplaced\u201d serves no purpose save to render the Statute tautologous. To so construe the Statute would be contrary to settled principle.\nPrima facie, therefore, the words \u201cerected\u201d, \u201cplaced\u201d and \u201caffixed\u201d do not connote the same things, and the word \u201cplaced\u201d at least must connote something less than is involved in the word \u201caffixed.\u201d\nWith respect to \u201cplaced\u201d, I do not think it is used in the Statute as equivalent merely to \u201cbrought upon\u201d so as to take in mere personal property which is intended to be shifted about at will. It involves the idea of setting a thing in a particular position with some idea of permanency. Thus, merely to bring a gas engine and portable saw upon premises would not be to \u201cplace\u201d them upon the land within the meaning of the Statute, any more than would be the case with a table, or a chair, or a typewriter, or similar articles.\n\u201cPlaced\u201d is defined in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary as\nto put or set in a particular place, position or situation.\nIn the context of the Statute, I think the Legislature must be taken to have had in mind the including of things which, although not acquiring the character of fixtures at common law, nevertheless acquire \u201clocality\u201d which things which are intended to be moved about, do not.\nIt is noteworthy that the Statute does not say \u201call buildings\u201d simpliciter, any more than it says \u201call machinery.\u201d If only buildings which become part of the land at common law are to be considered as falling within the statutory definition, there are many cases of buildings which might well be outside the Statute. All buildings are not necessarily fixtures at law, vide: Blanchard v. Bishop[4]; Phillips v. The Grand River Mutual Fire Insur. Co.,[5] per Armour J. as he then was, at 353; Bing Kee v. Yick Chong[6]. It has also been held that even the word \u201cfixtures\u201d does not necessarily connote things affixed to the freehold (see per Parke B. in Sheen v. Richie[7]. I do not think the intention of the legislature was to merely make assessable buildings which at law become part of the land, and I therefore think that the change in the wording of the Statute should be given its prima facie effect.\nIt is to be remembered that when the Statute of 1904 was passed, the assessment of personal property was abolished. Prior to the change it was unimportant for assessment purposes whether a given thing had become real or continued to be personal property, as both were assessable. In my opinion, the change in the definition of \u201cland\u201d made by the new legislation indicates an intention which the language used connotes on its face, namely, that the Legislature did not intend to abolish but to continue the assessment of chattels which, although not fixtures at law, nevertheless were not things intended in use to be moved from place to place.\nI therefore conclude that it is sufficient in the present case to bring the two articles here in question within the meaning of \u201cland\u201d in the Statute, that they are heavy article\u2019s placed each in one particular spot with the idea of remaining there so long as they are used for the purpose for which they were placed upon the premises.\nMr. Manning contends that to give this meaning to the Statute involves an absurdity when paragraph 17 of section 4 is considered. It reads as follows:\nAll fixed machinery used for manufacturing or farming purposes, including the foundations on which the same rests; but not fixed machinery used, intended or required for the production or supply of motive power including boilers and engines, gas, electric and other motors, nor machinery owned, operated or used by a transportation system or by a person having the right, authority or permission to construct, maintain or operate within Ontario in, under, above, on or through any highway, lane or other public communication, public place or public water, any structure or other thing, for the purposes of a bridge or transportation system, or for the purpose of conducting steam, heat, water, gas, oil, electricity or any property, substance or product capable of transportation, transmission or conveyance for the supply of water, light, heat, power, or other service. R.S.O. 1937, c. 272, s. 4, par. 17; am. 1947, c. 3, s. 4(3).\nIt is said that on the above view of the Statute, machinery used for manufacturing or farming purposes which is \u201cfixed\u201d (i.e. according to the argument, fixtures at law) is not to be considered as part of the land, while machinery not \u201cfixed\u201d (similarly mere personal property) would be considered real estate. I do not think this contention is sound, as in my opinion the word \u201cfixed\u201d in paragraph 17 is not used in the sense of excluding everything which has not become a fixture at law, but as involving the idea connoted by the word \u201cplaced\u201d with which I have already dealt, namely, as having acquired locality. While \u201cfixed\u201d by itself may normally involve something in the nature of attachment, it is, according to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, also used as the equivalent of \u201cplaced\u201d, and if the Statute is to be construed as a consistent whole, as it should, (Cartwright v. Toronto[8]) the word should be given this meaning in paragraph 17. This was essentially the view of the majority in the Court below. The view to which I have come was not put forward or considered in Town of Ford City v. Ford Motor Co.[9]. The decision of this Court was that the crane there in question fell within the provisions of the exempting clause.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Zimmerman, Blackwell and Haywood.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Caldbick & Yates.\n[1] [1949] O.R. 695.\n[2] (1922) 52 O.L.R. 664.\n[3] (1929) 63 O.L.R. 410.\n[4] (1911) 2 O.W.N. 996.\n[5] (1881) 46 U.C.Q.B. 334.\n[6] (1910) 43 Can.

German for the appellants.\nD. W. Mundell, K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKerwin J.: The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta 2 affirmed an order of H. J. Macdonald, J., striking out the name of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation as a party defendant in this action on the ground that, for all purposes, it was a servant and agent of the Crown, and that the plaintiffs could not maintain the suit against it in the Supreme Court of Alberta. The action is based on contract and was brought by Mr. and Mrs. Yeats against the Corporation, the Manufacturers Life Insurance Company, and Bow River Construction Company, Limited. It claims relief for breach of certain contracts for the construction of a house by the construction company and the loaning of a part of the cost thereof by the other defendants. The application to strike out the Corporation as a party defendant was made on the advice of its legal advisers and effect was given to their argument in the Courts below. When these judgments came to the attention of the Attorney General of Canada, he took a different view of the matter and no objection was raised to an application to the Appellate Division for leave to appeal to this Court, which leave was granted.\nIt is agreed that the Corporation entered into the contracts sued upon, on behalf of His Majesty within subsection 2 of section 5 of the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act, being chapter 15 of the Dominion Statutes of 1945, the said Corporation being described in the contracts as representing His Majesty the King in the right of Canada. It is also agreed that the Corporation in the manner aforesaid acquired or incurred a right or obligation in its own name under subsection 4 of section 5. This Act established the Corporation, consisting of the Minister of Finance and those persons who from time to time comprise the Board of Directors. Provision is made for the appointment of such a Board and an Executive Committee thereof, for advances by the Minister to the Corporation, and for loans under various Housing Acts therein specified. Section 5 reads:\u2014\n5. (1) Except as provided in section fourteen of this Act, the Corporation is for all purposes an agent of His Majesty in right of Canada and its powers under this Act may be exercised by it only as an agent of His Majesty.\n(2) The Corporation may, on behalf of His Majesty, enter into contracts in the name of His Majesty or in the name of the Corporation.\n(3) Property acquired by the Corporation is the property of His Majesty and title thereto may be vested in the name of His Majesty or in the name of the Corporation.\n(4) Where the Corporation has acquired or incurred a right or obligation in the name of the Corporation, it may sue or be sued in respect thereof in the name of the Corporation.\nSection 14, referred to, empowers the Corporation on its own behalf to \"employ such officers and employees for such purposes and on such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Executive Committee and such officers and employees are not officers or servants of His Majesty.\"\nAlthough at one time it was also agreed that the issue to be determined is whether or not there can be liability on the Corporation in an action in the Supreme Court of Alberta in respect of any alleged obligation incurred under section 5, subsection 4, the appeal was argued on the basis that the only matter' to be determined is whether the Corporation is subject to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Alberta. That point should be decided in the affirmative. While by subsection 1 of section 5 of the Act the Corporation is for all purposes an agent of His Majesty and its powers under the Act may be exercised by it only as an agent of His Majesty, subsection 2 provides that the Corporation may on behalf of His Majesty enter into contracts in the name of His Majesty or in the name of the Corporation. It being agreed that the contracts in question were entered into in the name of the Corporation, therefore, by virtue of subsection 4, it may sue or be sued in respect of any right or obligation so acquired or incurred. A number of cases are referred to in the reasons for judgment in the Courts below but only those now to be mentioned need be considered.\nWhile there are differences between the contracts here sued upon and the agreement in question in International Railway Co. v. Niagara Parks Commission 3, the reasoning of the Judicial Committee in that case applies as the appellants have sued only the Corporation. See also Rattenbury v. Land Settlement Board 4.\nThe latest pronouncement is the judgment of the House of Lords in Tyne Improvement Commissioners v. Armement Anversois S\/A (The Brabo) 5. The point there determined was that leave to serve notice of a concurrent writ out of the jurisdiction could not be granted as the action had not been \"properly brought\" against the Minister of Supply within the meaning of R.S.C. Order 11, r. 1(g). However, in the course of so concluding, their Lordships stated that it was plain under the relevant statu- tory enactments that the Minister could be sued in the ordinary Courts without the necessity of a petition of right but that did not debar him from the protection which the Crown itself would have had in the particular case.\nWe have not before us a case like City of Halifax v. Halifax Harbour Commissioners 6, because there the judgment was based upon the conclusion that the occupancy of the harbour property by the Halifax Harbour Commissioners was of such a character as to constitute that occupation an occupation \"for the Crown\" and, therefore, the Commissioners were not taxable in respect thereof. When such a question does arise, it will be necessary to consider the provisions of subsection 2 of section 30 of the Act:\u2014\n(2) Where title to real or immovable property becomes vested in the name of the Corporation or of His Majesty, whether alone or jointly with any other person, in consequence of foreclosure or other proceedings taken in respect of a mortgage assigned to the Corporation or to which His Majesty is a party under the Housing Acts, the Corporation may pay to a municipal or other taxing authority an amount equivalent to the taxes which might be levied in respect of the said property or of the interest of the Corporation or of His Majesty therein by the said authority if the said property or interest were not so vested, and may enter into such agreements as may be necessary to give effect to the provisions of this subsection.\nThe Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 34, was referred to in the reasons for judgment of H. J. Macdonald, J., but the only suggested applicable sections are 18 and 19. Section 18 does not apply as this case is not the \"subject of a suit or action against the Crown\" and the meaning of these words in the early part of the section is not enlarged by the concluding phrase \"or in which the claim arises out of a contract entered into by or on behalf of the Crown.\" Section 19, so far as it might have any relevancy, makes provision in respect of \"claims against the Crown.\" Here, the appellants desire to have decided their claims against the Corporation (not the Crown) at the same time as their claims against the other defendants. The provisions of the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act are apt to authorize the Corporation being sued in the Provincial Court and the judgments below should, therefore, be set aside and the motion to strike out the Corporation as a party defendant and dismiss the action as against it, should be dismissed. The appellants are entitled to their costs throughout against the Corporation.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: German, Mackay and McLaws.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Macleod, Riley, McDermid and Dixon.\n1 [1949] 2 W.W.R. 1110.\n2 [1949] 2 W.W.R. 1110.\n3 [1941] 2 A.E.R. 456.\n4 [1929] S.C.R. 52.\n5 [1949] A.C. 326.\n6 [1935] S.C.R. 215.\n",

(DEFENDANTS)\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\n1950, Feb. 7, Apr. 25\nPRESENT: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand, Kellock, Locke and Cartwright JJ.\nCriminal law\u2014\"Peeping tom\"\u2014Whether criminal offence\u2014Conduct likely to cause breach of peace\u2014False imprisonment\u2014Arrest without war\u00adrant\u2014Burden of proof\u2014Criminal Code, ss. 80, 846, 647, 648, 650\u2014Supreme Court Act, R.S.B.C. 1956, c. 66, s. 77.\nAppellant was chased, caught and detained by respondent, Fedoruk, after he had been seen on Fedoruk's property looking into a lighted side window of the house where a woman was preparing for bed. A policeman, the other respondent, was called and, after some investiga\u00adtion, arrested appellant without warrant.\nOn a charge that he \"unlawfully did act in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace by peeping ...\" appellant was convicted by a Police Magistrate but acquitted by the Court of Appeal.\nHis claim for damages for malicious prosecution and for false imprisonment was dismissed by the trial judge and this was affirmed by a majority in the Court of Appeal on the ground that appellant had been guilty of a criminal offence at common law and therefore that there had been justification for the arrest without warrant. The appeal to this Court is concerned only with the claim for false imprisonment.\nHeld: Appellant's conduct did not amount to any criminal offence known to the law. Therefore respondents have failed to satisfy the onus placed upon them to justify the imprisonment under ss. 30, 648 or 650 of the Criminal Code. Held also: Section 30 Cr. C. authorizes a peace officer to arrest without warrant only if he, on reasonable and probable grounds, believes that an offence for which the offender may be arrested without warrant has been committed, but not if he erroneously concludes that the facts amount to an offence, when, as a matter of law, they do not.\nHeld further: Conduct, not otherwise criminal and not falling within any category of offences defined by the criminal law, does not become criminal because a natural and probable result thereof will be to provoke others to violent retributive action; acts likely to cause a breach of the peace are not in themselves criminal merely because they have this tendency. It is for Parliament and not for the Courts to decide if any course of conduct, which has not up to the present been regarded as criminal, is now to be so regarded.\nPer Kerwin J.: The appellant, by \"peeping\", did not commit a breach of the peace. If he had, it is not an offence for which either a police constable or a private individual might arrest without warrant under ss. 646 or 647 of the Criminal Code. Sections 30, 648 and 650 afford no assistance to either respondents since no criminal offence was committed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] affirming, Robertson JA. dissenting, the dismissal by the trial judge of an action for false im\u00adprisonment and malicious prosecution.\nH. R. Bray, K.C. for the appellant.\nLee A. Kelley, K.C. and W. R. Meredith for the respon\u00addent Stone.\nKERWIN J.: The plaintiff in this action, Frey, appeals against a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia\u00b9 affirming by a majority, so far as the defendants Fedoruk and Stone are concerned, the dismissal of the action by the trial judge. The action as tried was for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution but the action stands dismissed as against all defendants on the latter issue and we are not concerned with it in this appeal.\nThe claim for false imprisonment arose from the follow\u00ading circumstances which, though some are denied by the appellant, must be taken to be established. While on his way home from work about 11.15 p.m. on March 4, 1947, the appellant stopped the truck which he was driving on the highway, turned out the lights on the truck and walked to the rear of a house occupied by the defendant Fedoruk, his wife, and mother. There he peeped through a window upon which there was no blind but the curtains of which had been drawn to within six to eight inches of each other, and was seen by Fedoruk's mother while she was standing in her nightgown in her lighted bedroom. The mother's cry, \"Man at window\", was heard by the wife of Fedoruk, who called him. Seizing a butcher knife, he ran out the door in time to see the appellant leaving the property. Upon Fedoruk's shouting, the appellant started to run but was caught by Fedoruk about 300 feet down the road while the appellant was attempting to insert the key in the ignition lock of the truck. Fedoruk brought the appel\u00adlant back to the house and the police were notified. The defendant, Constable Stone, and another police officer came and, after investigating thoroughly by examining the footprints upon the dewy ground and in other ways, Stone arrested the appellant and took him to a police station. There he was charged that he \"unlawfully did act in such a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace by peeping at night through the window of the house of S. Fedoruk\". His conviction by a magistrate on that charge was set aside by the Court of Appeal and the present action followed.\nThere was agreement in the Court of Appeal that a bare trespass not amounting to a breach of the peace is not a criminal offence. The difference of opinion arose between the majority, who considered that an actual breach of the peace had occurred, and Mr. Justice Robertson who thought otherwise. As Mr. Justice O'Halloran, speaking for the majority, pointed out:\u2014\"Furthermore, it would seem plain at common law that if the intruder's conduct did not constitute a criminal offence, then he could not be charged with conduct likely to cause a breach of the peace by the Fedoruks.\" It may be difficult to define exhaustively what is a breach of the peace but, for present purposes, the statement in Clerk and Lindsell on Torts, (10th edition), page 298, may be accepted:\u2014\nA breach of the peace takes place when either an actual assault is committed on an individual or public alarm and excitement is caused. Mere annoyance or insult to an individual stopping short of actual personal violence is not a breach of the peace. Thus a householder\u2014apart from special police legislation\u2014cannot give a man into custody for violently and persistently ringing his door-bell. As authority for the last sentence, a case of false impris\u00adonment, Grant v. Moser[2], is cited. It is true that it was decided on a pleading which ultimately the defendant was permitted to amend but the latter part of the report, con\u00adtaining the argument of Sergt. Talfourd for the defendant, including interpolations by Chief Justice Tindal and Cresswell J. is significant. It reads :\nIt is submitted that the plea sufficiently discloses a breach of the peace at the time of the arrest. After stating that the plaintiff \"with force and arms\" came to the house and violently rang the bell, and con\u00adtinued so doing after being requested to desist, it states that \"thereupon (which must mean instanter) the defendant gave him in charge. In Baynes v. Brewster (2 Q.B. 375; 1 G. & D. 669) a plea justifying the plaintiff's arrest for creating a disturbance by rapping at the defendant's door was held bad because it appeared that the disturbance was over at the time of the arrest (Tindal C.J. And that, although the plea stated that the defendant gave the plaintiff in charge \"in order to preserve the peace.\" Cresswell J. What allegation is there in. this plea of anything having been done in breach of the peace?) It alleges that the disturbance took place \"against the peace of our Lady the Queen.\" (Tindal C.J. Those are mere verba sonantia. One party cannot arrest another for a mere unlawful act. Cresswell J. Every trespass is laid as a breach of the peace. Suppose the plaintiff had blown a horn in the front of the defendant's house, that might have been a breach of the metropolitan police act (2 & 3 Viet. c. 47. See sect. 54, div. 14) ; but it would not have been a breach of the peace. Tindal C.J. To make this a good defence there should be a direct allegation either of a breach of the peace committing at the time of giving the plaintiff into custody, or that a breach had been committed, and that there was reasonable ground for apprehending its renewal.)\nIn the earlier case of Green v. Bartram[3], to quote the headnote:\n(A. went to the house of B. to demand a debt, which B. said he could not pay. Angry words passed, and B. told A. to leave his house, this A. refused to do unless he was paid. Upon this B. sent for a police officer, and had A. locked up in the watch-house: Held, (by Lord Tenterden, C.J.) that if A. was making a disturbance B. would have been justified in turning him out of his house, but that he was not justified in imprisoning him.)\nNotwithstanding the contemptible actions of the appel\u00adlant, I find, myself in agreement with the dissenting judge that the appellant did not, even in view of all the surround\u00ading circumstances, commit a breach of the peace. If he had, it was not an offence for which either a police con\u00adstable or a private individual might arrest without warrant under sections 646 or 647 of the Criminal Code. Section 30 authorizes a peace officer to arrest without warrant only if he, on reasonable and probable grounds, believes that an offence for which the offender may be arrested without warrant has been committed. Since no criminal offence was committed, subsection 1 of section 648:\nA peace officer may arrest, without warrant, any one whom he finds, committing any criminal offence.\naffords no assistance to the respondent Stone even if it could be said that he had found the appellant \"committing\". Similarly, section 650 affords no assistance to the respondent Fedoruk, assuming that he was the owner of the property. The majority in the Court of Appeal considered that the statute 34 Edw. III, c. 1, was not in force in British Columbia but, even if it were, it would not apply since no offence had been committed.\nThe appeal should be allowed and judgment should be entered for the appellant for the amounts fixed by Mr. Justice Robertson as to which no question was raised; that is, against Fedoruk for $10 and against Stone for $50. The appellant is entitled to his costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court. There should be no costs of the action against the respondents so far as the issue of false arrest is concerned unless the appellant is able to secure an order under section 77 of the Supreme Court Act of British Columbia.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau, Rand, Kellock, Locke and Cartwright, JJ. was delivered by:\nCARTWRIGHT J.: \u2014 This appeal raises questions as to whether the conduct of the Plaintiff, which is popularly described as that of a \"peeping tom\", constitutes a criminal offence and if so, whether the Defendants Fedoruk and Stone were justified in arresting the Plaintiff without a warrant.\nIn this Court, the appeal was presented as depending upon undisputed facts which may be briefly stated as follows:\nAbout 11.15 p.m. on the 4th of March 1947, the mother of the Defendant, Fedoruk, while standing in her night-gown in her lighted bedroom in her son's house saw the Plaintiff peeping into her window, the curtains of which were only partially drawn. She was frightened and called to her son who seized a butcher knife and ran outside. He shouted at the Plaintiff who was then just leaving Fedoruk's property. The Plaintiff started to run; Fedoruk chased him about one hundred yards to a point where the Plaintiff .was trying to unlock and get into his truck. The lights of the truck were out. Fedoruk took the Plaintiff back to his house, threatening him with the knife. Fedoruk's mother identified the Plaintiff as the man whom she had seen at her window and the police were called. The Defendant Stone, a police constable, arrived accompanied by another police officer, and after some investigation, as a result of which he formed the opinion that the Plaintiff had been \"peeping\", he told the Plaintiff he was under arrest and took him to the Police Station where he was confined.\nThere are allegations in the pleadings and in the evidence that the Defendant Stone assaulted the Plaintiff on his way to the Police Station and at the Police Station, but as to this, there appear to be concurrent findings of fact against the Plaintiff, and counsel for the Plaintiff made it clear in his factum and in his argument that the Plaintiff's appeal was limited to his claim for damages for false imprisonment as against the Defendants Fedoruk and Stone.\nThe learned trial Judge dismissed the action against all three Defendants. The Court of Appeal[4] unani\u00admously allowed the appeal as to the Defendant Watt and awarded the Plaintiff $100 damages against him, and from this award no appeal was taken. The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the Plaintiff's appeal as against Fedoruk and Stone. Robertson, J.A. dissenting would have allowed the appeal as to these Defendants also and would have awarded the Plaintiff damages of $10 against Fedoruk and $50 against Stone. Leave to appeal was granted to the Plaintiff by the Court of Appeal.\nThe majority of the Court of Appeal were of opinion that the Plaintiff was guilty of a criminal offence at Com\u00admon Law, and that the Defendants were justified in the circumstances in arresting him without a warrant. Robertson, J.A. was of the view that on the facts as found, no criminal offence was committed by the Plaintiff. The claim being one for damages for false imprisonment, in my opinion, the following short passage from Halsbury's Laws of England, Second Edition, Volume 33, page 38 correctly states the law:\nThe gist of the action of false imprisonment is the mere imprisonment; the plaintiff need not prove that the imprisonment was unlawful or malicious, but establishes a prima facie case if he proves that he was imprisoned by the defendant; the onus then lies on the defendant of proving a justification.\nThere is no question on the facts but that the Plaintiff was imprisoned first by Fedoruk and afterwards by Stone, and in order to succeed it was therefore necessary for each of them to plead and prove that the imprisonment was legally justifiable. The justification pleaded by Fedoruk consists of a brief statement of the facts outlined above followed by the allegation that fearing that the Plaintiff was under the circumstances in question, doing an act which was likely to cause a breach of the peace, to wit, peeping without any lawful excuse into the windows of his mother's bedroom while hiding outside, he pursued the Plaintiff through his property and arrested the Plaintiff because of the violation of law committed by the said Plaintiff.\nThe justification pleaded by Stone is that he placed the Plaintiff under arrest by reason of the commission of an act by the said Plaintiff that was likely to cause a breach of the peace by reason of the said Plaintiff peeping at night through the window of the home of Stephen Fedoruk, and in particular through the window of the bedroom of the said Defendant's mother while she was undressing and preparing for bed and only after having investigated the explanation given by the Plaintiff and having found that the same could not be in accordance with the facts.\nIt will be observed that the Defendant Stone does not plead that he believed a breach of the peace had been committed or that such breach had in fact been com\u00admitted. He limits his plea to the allegation that the Plaintiff had committed an act likely to cause a breach of the peace.\nThe only charge laid against the Plaintiff was that he:\nunlawfully did act in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace by peeping at night through the window of the house of S. Fedoruk, there situated, against the peace of our Lord the King, his Crown and dignity; Contrary to the form of Statute in such case made and provided. On this charge the Plaintiff was convicted by a police magistrate sitting for the summary trial of an indictable offence. The formal conviction concludes with the words:\nand I adjudge the said Bernard Frey for his said offence to keep the Peace and be of good behaviour for the term of one year.\nThis conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal on the ground that the evidence on the record did not support the conviction, without that court finding it neces\u00adsary to decide whether or not the acts charged constituted a criminal offence. This is stated in the judgment of O'Halloran, J.A, who was a member of the Court which quashed the conviction.\nIt would appear that the acquittal of the Plaintiff on the criminal charge does not preclude the Defendants from showing as their justification for having imprisoned him that he had in fact committed the offence of which he had been acquitted. See Cahill v. Fitzgibbon[5] and Cook v. Field[6].\nO'Halloran, J.A. with whom Sidney Smith, J.A. agrees, stated his conclusion that the Plaintiff had committed an offence at Common Law in the following words:\nHe himself committed a breach of the \"King's Peace\" by acting in a way that produced fear in the inmates of the house; he disturbed their tranquillity and privacy in a manner that he would naturally expect to invite immediate violence against him. Among other things it is instinctive in man to take physical reprisal against invasion of the privacy of his womenfolk particularly at night. Accordingly his breach of the \"King's peace\" was more than likely to cause an immediate breach of the King's peace by the inmates of the house; and he contributed another sinister incident by running when Fedoruk shouted at him instead of stopping and talking to Fedoruk.\nNo attempt is made to define completely the Common Law offence of \"breach of the King's Peace\", except to say, it is not used here in its common and more narrow sense.\nO'Halloran, J.A. later continues:\nAs previously intimated, breach of the peace has two significations; the narrow and common one applicable to riots, tumults and actual physical violence; and the other and wider one which goes so deeply into the roots of the Common law, viz., any disturbance of the tranquillity of people, which if not punished, will naturally lead to physical reprisals, with wider and more aggravated disturbances of the \"King's Peace\"\nWhile O'Halloran, J.A. takes the view that the Criminal Code does not expressly make the Plaintiff's conduct criminal and that at Common Law merely looking through a window at night is not in itself a criminal offence, he goes on to hold that the circumstances in which the act is done may change its character, and continues:\nIt is my judgment that the circumstances here surround the intruder's act of looking in the window with such sinister implications, that in the lack of a credible explanation, his conduct as a whole must be regarded as criminal at Common Law. It was late at night, the intruder was on private property some thirty to forty feet back from the street line; he was looking in a side window which did not face the street, the window was lighted and he could see a woman preparing for bed. Quite apart from the \"peeping tom\" aspect, the presence of a prowler in such circum\u00adstances, the dread of the hostile unknown at night, would naturally frighten the inmates of the house, and incite them to immediate violent defensive or offensive action against him.\nRobertson, J.A. dissenting, was of opinion that the Plaintiff did not commit an actual breach of the peace. He points out that \"an indictment will not lie for a bare tres\u00adpass not amounting to an actual breach of the peace.\" This statement of the law is amply supported by the authorities cited by Robertson, J.A. all of which were decided long after the passing of C.8 of 5 Rich. II (1381), referred to in the judgment of O'Halloran, J.A. as making unlawful entry into any lands a criminal offence even if unaccompanied by violence. In my view that statute contemplates entry with the intention of taking possession and has no reference to an isolated and temporary act of trespass such as occurred in this case. I agree with the conclusion of Robertson, J.A. that the Plaintiff did not commit any criminal offence.\nWe have been referred to no reported case in which the conduct of a \"peeping tom\" was held to be a criminal offence. It, is well settled that, while the rule may not be so strict as in criminal cases, in a civil case where a right or defence rests on an allegation of criminal conduct a heavy onus lies upon the party alleging it, and questions that are left in doubt by circumstantial evidence must be resolved in favour of innocence.\nThere is no suggestion in the evidence of any attempt on the part of the Plaintiff to offer violence to anyone. A reasonable inference to be drawn from the facts recited above is that the Plaintiff had no intention of himself doing any violent act and hoped that he would not be discovered.\nWhen he was discovered he at once ran away. In my opinion, the mere fact that his presence at night in close proximity to the window would have the probable effect of frightening the inmate of the room does not make such conduct criminal at Common Law.\nWhile I agree with the view expressed by O'Halloran, J.A. that such conduct, if discovered, would naturally frighten the inmates of the house and that it would tend to incite them to immediate violent action against the intruder, I am doubtful whether such action could be properly described as defensive. I would describe it rather as offensive and retributive. I do not think action is defensive when the person against whom it is taken has given no indication of any intention to attack and is already in flight. I do not think that it is safe to hold as a matter of law, that conduct, not otherwise criminal and not falling within any category of offences defined by the Criminal Law, becomes criminal because a natural and probable result thereof will be to provoke others to violent retribu\u00adtive action. If such a principle were admitted, it seems to me that many courses of conduct which it is well settled are not criminal could be made the subject of indictment by setting out the facts and concluding with the words that such conduct was likely to cause a breach of the peace. Two examples may be mentioned. The speaking of insulting words unaccompanied by any threat of violence undoubtedly may and sometimes does produce violent retributive action, but is not criminal. The commission of adultery has, in many recorded cases, when unexpectedly discovered, resulted in homicide; but, except where ex\u00adpressly made so by Statute, adultery is not a crime.\nIf it should be admitted as a principle that conduct may be treated as criminal because, although not otherwise criminal, it has a natural tendency to provoke violence by way of retribution, it seems to me that great uncertainty would result. I do not think it safe by the application of such a supposed principle to declare an act or acts criminal which have not, up to the present, been held to be criminal in any reported case.\nThis would be my view if the matter were not covered by authority, but it also appears to me to be supported by authority. In my view it has been rightly held that acts likely to cause a breach of the peace are not in themselves criminal merely because they have this tendency, and that the only way in which such conduct can be dealt with and restrained, apart from civil proceedings for damages, is by taking the appropriate steps to have the persons com\u00admitting such acts bound over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.\nThis appears to be the view of Lord Goddard, with whom Humphreys, J. agrees, in Rex v. County of London Quarter Sessions Appeals Committee[7], particularly at page 475, where he says:\nIn Dalton's Country Justice, a work of the highest authority, a cata\u00adlogue is given, not intended, I think, to be exhaustive, of a large number of instances which would justify sureties for good behaviour being taken. It starts with rioters and barrators, and goes on to such cases as night-walkers and eavesdroppers, suspected persons who live idly and yet fare well, or are well apparelled having nothing whereon to live, and common gamesters.\nNone of these were ever indictable offences. Eavesdroppers are first defined in Termes de la Ley as \"such as stand under walls or windows by night or by day to hear news and to carry them to others to make strife and debate amongst their neighbours\".\nThough it is said in Russell on Crimes that eavesdropping was dealt with in the Sheriff's Tourn and Courts Leet as an offence, so far as I am aware no instance can be found in the books of any indictment being preferred for this offence at common law. It follows, therefore, that nobody can be convicted of eavesdropping or nightwalking, or of many of the other matters which are mentioned by Dalton, although, no doubt, in modern times, the necessity for good government in towns and cities has caused the Legislature to pass Acts which make things which in earlier days were regarded as no more than bad behaviour criminal offences; and it is necessary to bear in mind that in the present case which we are considering no charge of having committed any offence against a statute such as the Metropolitan Police Act was preferred.\nIn Ex parte Davis[8], Blackburn, J. points out that the binding over of a person to keep the peace is not an action or proceeding by way of punishment, but is only a pre-cautionary proceeding to prevent a breach of the peace.\nIn Rex v. Sandbach Ex parte Williams[9], Humphreys, J. citing Blackstone, Volume (iv), page 256 points out that a man may be bound to his good behaviour for causes of scandal contra bonos mores, as well as contra pacem.\nIn my view, the Plaintiff's conduct in peeping through the window was contra bonos mores, but was not contra pacem in the sense of being a breach of the criminal law.\nThe case of Davies v. Griffiths[10], is a decision of the King's Bench Division. The judgment is given by Lord Hewart, C.J., and the other members of the Court, Mac\u00adnaghten and Singleton, JJ. agree with him.\nIt is stated in the report that the relevant facts proved .or admitted, showed that the appellant, Davies, had attempted to address a meeting near the entrance to a colliery and persisted in such conduct, despite the protest of a police inspector, that previously there had been breaches of the peace at the colliery and that the appellant's conduct was such as might lead to a breach of the peace.\nDavies had been convicted by justices on two informa\u00adtions preferred against him by the respondent Griffiths. The first of these was \"having on August 18, 1936 been guilty of conduct near the Taff Merthyr Colliery, Gelligaer, which might lead to breaches of the peace, contrary to the common law\". The Lord Chief Justice, having stated that the major point in the appeal was as to this first charge said :\nWith regard to the first information it is quite evident that there was a misconception. The only course open to the justices when the facts had been proved was, if they thought fit, to bind the appellant over to keep the peace and perhaps to find sureties. It is common ground at the Bar that the course which the justices took was a course not open to them. They fined the appellant on the basis that he had committed a sub\u00adstantive offence to which a penalty might apply. In so doing they erred in point of law.\nIn my view, the definition of a breach of the Peace in Wharton's Law Lexicon, 14th Edition, page 143, quoted by Robertson, J.A. \"offences against the public which are either actual violations of the peace, or constructive violations, by tending to make others break it\", is too wide if the concluding words \"or constructive violations, by tending to make others break it\" are intended to include conduct likely to produce violence only by way of retribu\u00adtion against the supposed offender.\nO'Halloran, J.A. does not refer to any reported case in which the conduct of a \"peeping tom\" has been held to be a criminal offence. As mentioned above, we were referred to no such case by counsel, and I have not been able to find one.\nI do not understand O'Halloran, J.A, to suggest in his elaborate reasons that there is precedent for the view that the Plaintiff's conduct in this case was criminal. Rather he appears to support the finding of the trial Judge to that effect on the grounds stated in the following paragraph:\nCriminal responsibility at Common law is primarily not a matter of precedent, but of application of generic principle to the differing facts of each case. It is for the jury to apply to the facts of the case as they find them, the generic principle the Judge gives them. Thus by their general verdict the jury in practical effect decide both the law and the facts in the particular case, and have consistently done so over the centuries, and cf. Coke on Littleton (1832 Ed.) vol. 1, note 5, para. 155 (b). The fact finding Judge in this case, as the record shows, had not the slightest doubt on the evidence before him that what the appellant had been accused of was a criminal offence at Common Law.\nIn my opinion when it is read against the background of the rest of the Reasons of O'Halloran, J.A., it, appears that, in relation to the facts of this case, the \"generic principle\" which the learned Judge has in mind is too wide to have any value as a definition. The genus appears to be \"a breach of the King's Peace\" in the wider signification which is attached to that expression elsewhere in the Reasons.\nIt appears to me that so understood, the genus is wide enough to include the whole field of the criminal law. As it is put in Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law (1895) Volume 1, page 22:\nall criminal offences have long been said to be committed against the King's peace.\nand in Volume 2 of the same work at page 452, it is stated:\nto us a breach of the King's peace may seem to cover every possible crime,\nOnce the expression \"a breach of the King's Peace\" is interpreted, as O'Halloran, J.A. undoubtedly does interpret it, not to require as an essential ingredient anything in the nature of \"riots, tumults, or actual physical violence\" on the part of the offender, it would appear to become wide enough to include any conduct which in the view of the fact finding tribunal is so injurious to the public as to merit punishment. If, on the other hand, O'Halloran, J.A. intended to give to the expression a more limited meaning so that it would include only conduct of a nature likely to lead to a breach of the peace in the narrower sense of which he speaks, the authorities referred to elsewhere in this Judgment seem to me to show that this is not an offence known to the law. I am of opinion that the proposition implicit in the paragraph quoted above ought not to be accepted. I think that if adopted, it would introduce great uncertainty into the administration of the Criminal Law, leaving it to the judicial officer trying any particular charge to decide that the acts proved constituted a crime or otherwise, not by reference to any defined standard to be found in the code or in reported decisions, but according to his individual view as to whether such acts were a disturbance of the tranquillity of people tending to provoke physical reprisal.\nTo so hold would, it seems to me, be to assert the exist\u00adence of what is referred to in Stephen's History of the Criminal Law of England, Volume 2, Page 190, as:\nthe power which has in some instances been claimed for the Judges of declaring anything to be an offence which is injurious to the public, although it may not have been previously regarded as such.\nThe writer continues:\nthis power, if it exists at all, exists at Common Law.\nIn my opinion, this power has not been held and should not be held to exist in Canada. I think it safer to hold that no one shall be convicted of a crime unless the offence with which he is charged is recognized as such in the provisions of the Criminal Code, or can be established by the authority of some reported case as an offence known to the law. I think that if any course of conduct is now to be declared criminal, which has not up to the present time been so regarded, such declaration should be made by Parliament and not by the Courts.\nHaving reached the conclusion that the Plaintiff's conduct did not amount to any criminal offence known to the law, the question whether the Defendants were justified in arresting Frey presents little difficulty. The justi\u00adfication put forward in argument was based on certain sections of the Criminal Code all of which, with the excep\u00adtion of Section 30, would require as a condition of their affording justification to the Defendants the fact that some criminal offence had been committed.\nSection 30 would be of no avail to Fedoruk who was not a peace officer, but it must be examined in regard to Stone. The section reads as follows:\nEvery peace officer who, on reasonable and probable grounds, believes that an offence for which the offender may be arrested without warrant has been committed, whether it has been committed or not, and who, on reasonable and probable grounds, believes that any person has committed that offence, is justified in arresting such person without warrant, whether such person is guilty or not.\nIt may be that Stone's Statement of Defence is not aptly framed to raise this section as a defence but I do not think it necessary or desirable to decide this point upon the precise form of the pleadings. In my opinion, assuming, without deciding, that the form of the pleadings permits Stone to rely upon it, this section does not afford any justification for his arresting the Plaintiff.\nI think that this section contemplates the situation where a Peace Officer, on reasonable and probable grounds, be\u00adlieves in the existence of a state of facts which, if it did exist would have the legal result that the person whom he was arresting had commited an offence for which such person could be arrested without a warrant. It cannot, I think, mean that a Peace Officer is justified in arresting a person when the true facts are known to the Officer and he erroneously concludes that they amount to an offence, when, as a matter of law, they do not amount to an offence at all. \"Ignorantia legis non excusat\".\nHaving reached the conclusion that the Plaintiff com\u00admitted no criminal offence, it is not necessary to examine the authorities collected and discussed by O'Halloran, J.A. as to the meaning of the terms \"found committing\" or \"whom he finds committing\".\nFor the reasons set out above, I am of the opinion that the Plaintiff's conduct did not amount to a criminal offence, and that the Defendants Fedoruk and Stone have failed to satisfy the onus which lay upon them of showing some justification in law for having imprisoned him. I agree with Robertson, J.A. that the Plaintiff was entitled to succeed as against both Defendants.\nI would not vary the assessment of the damages proposed by Robertson, J.A. The Plaintiff's counsel does not ask that they be increased and I do not think that the amounts suggested are excessive. While I agree with Robertson, J.A. that in a sense \"the whole matter was brought upon the Plaintiff by himself\", the facts remain that his arrest was effected by Fedoruk by the threatening use of a deadly weapon, he was deprived of his liberty for several hours and subjected to some minor indignities at the police station, all without any justification in law.\nIn the result I would allow the appeal and direct that judgment be entered against Fedoruk for $10 and against Stone for $50 with costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal and of the appeal to this Court. There should be no costs of the action against the Respondents unless the Appellant is able to secure an order under section 77 of The Supreme Court Act of British Columbia, allowing him costs of the action so far as the issue of false arrest is concerned.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fleishman and Fleishman.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Angelo E.

VIII, c. 49. A shed, leased by appellant to respondent C.S.L. and in which were stored respondent's and third parties' goods, caught fire while appellant's employees, acting within the scope of their duties, were doing repairs to it in compliance with appellant's obligation to maintain the shed under clause 8 of the lease.\nClause 7 provided that \"the lessee shall not have any claim or demand against the lessor for detriment, damage or injury of any nature \u2026 to the said shed \u2026 or materials \u2026 goods \u2026 placed, made or being \u2026 in the said shed\".\nBy clause 17 it was provided that \"the lessee shall \u2026 indemnify \u2026 the lessor \u2026 against all claims and demands \u2026 based upon, occasioned by or attributable to the execution of these presents, or any action taken or things done or maintained by virtue hereof, or the exercise in any manner of rights arising hereunder\".\nThe trial judge held that appellant's employees had been negligent and that clause 7 could not be invoked as their negligence amounted to \"faute lourde\". For the same reason, he dismissed the third party proceedings instituted by appellant under clause 17. At the hearing, this Court declared that the finding of negligence by the trial judge could not be disturbed.\nHeld: The intention of the parties to be gathered from the whole of the document was that, as between the lessor and the lessee, the lessor should be exempt under both clauses 7 and 17 from liability founded on negligence (Locke J. contra as to clause 7).\nHeld also: The conduct of appellant's employees did not amount to \"faute lourde\".\nPer Locke J. (dissenting in part): As there was here a double liability\u2014the contractual obligation on the part of the Crown to maintain the shed under clause 8 and the liability of the Crown under s. 19 of the Exchequer Court Act\u2014the liability in negligence not having been expressly or by implication excluded, remains and therefore clause 7 does not afford an answer to respondent's claim.\nGlengoil Steamship Co. v.

John Bumbray K.C. for Cunningham & Wells, for Copping and for W. H. Taylor Ltd.\nJohn L. O'Brien K.C. and John Nolan for Canada and Dominion Sugar Co. Ltd.\nThe Chief Justice: These are appeals from judgments of the Exchequer Court of Canada rendered by Angers J. in November, 1948 2.\nBy the first judgment, the Court below maintained with costs the Petition of Right of the Respondent Canada Steamship Lines, Limited, for the sum of $40,713.72.\nBy the second judgment, the Court below maintained with costs the Petition of Right of the Respondent H. J. Heinz Company of Canada, Limited, for the sum of $38,430.88.\nBy the third judgment, the Court below maintained with costs the Petition of Right of the Respondent Cunningham and Wells, Limited, for the sum of $15,159.83.\nBy the fourth judgment, the Court below maintained with costs the Petition of Right of the Respondent Raymond Copping, for the sum of $1,662.37.\nBy the fifth judgment, the Court below maintained with costs the Petition of Right of the Respondent W. H. Taylor, Limited, for the sum of $3,670.25.\nBy the sixth judgment, the Court below maintained with costs the Petition of Right of the Respondent Canada and Dominion Sugar Co., Limited, for the sum of $108,310.83.\nThird Party proceedings were instituted by the Appellant against the Respondent Canada Steamship Lines, Limited, in each of the above cases, except, of course, the petition directly made by Canada Steamship Lines, Limited, itself.\nThese six cases were tried together and all arise out of a fire which, on May 5, 1944, completely destroyed the Canada Steamship Lines Ottawa street freight shed located on the Lachine Canal in the inner harbour of Montreal.\nThe damages awarded to each of the Petitioners were established by admissions filed in each case and, therefore, the only question remaining to be decided was as to the responsibility of the Appellant, which the learned trial judge found against the latter. At the hearing in this Court, after the conclusion of the argument of the Appellant's counsel, the Court declared that the findings of negligence on the part of the Appellant's employees, as made in the judgments appealed from, could not be disturbed. It follows that the judgments in favour of the Respondents H. J. Heinz Company of Canada, Limited; Cunningham and Wells, Limited; Raymond Copping; W. H. Taylor, Limited; and Canada and Dominion Sugar Co., Limited, must be confirmed with costs of the appeal against the Appellant.\nWith regard, however, to the petition of Canada Steamship Lines, Limited, and the Third Party proceedings, other considerations apply, in view of the existence between the Appellant and Canada Steamship Lines, Limited, of a lease whereby the latter was put in possession of the freight shed owned by the Appellant. It is the effect of that lease with regard to the respective claims of Canada Steamship Lines, Limited, and His Majesty which stands to be discussed.\nThe lease in question, dated the 18th of November, 1940, gave to Canada Steamship Lines, Limited, the right and privilege to occupy, use and enjoy the shed for the purpose of receiving and storing therein freight and goods loaded into or unloaded from vessels owned and operated by them. It was there agreed between the parties that the lease was made and executed upon and subject to the covenants, provisoes, conditions and reservations thereafter set forth and contained, \"and that the same and every of them, representing and expressing the exact intention of the parties, are to be strictly observed, performed and complied with\". One of these covenants, provisoes, conditions and reservations is contained in Clauses 7 and 8 of the lease; and another is contained in. Clause 17, which it is convenient to reproduce here:\n7. That the Lessee shall not have any claim or demand against the Lessor for detriment, damage or injury of any nature to the said land, the said shed, the said platform and the said canopy, or to any motor or other vehicles, materials, supplies, goods, articles, effects or things at any time brought, placed, made or being upon the said land, the said platform or in the said shed.\n8. That the Lessor will, at all times during the currency of this lease, at his own cost and expense, maintain the said shed, exclusive of the said platform and the said canopy. 17. That the Lessee shall at all times indemnify and save harmless the Lessor from and against all claims and demands, loss, costs, damages, actions, suits or other proceedings by whomsoever made, brought or prosecuted, in any manner based upon, occasioned by or attributable to the execution of these Presents, or any action taken or things done or maintained by virtue hereof, or the exercise in any manner of rights arising hereunder.\nIt is apparent that Clauses 7 and 8 have to do with the direct claim of Canada Steamship Lines, Limited, and Clause 17 is invoked by the Appellant in connection with the Third Party proceedings.\nTaking first Clauses 7 and 8, the contention of the Appellant is that they relieved him of any claim or demand by the Canadian Steamship Lines, Limited, for the damage suffered by the latter in the circumstances.\nThe fire was caused by the employees of the Appellant, while they were repairing the shed, and it is clear that, when carrying out those repairs, the Appellant was complying with his obligation to maintain the shed by force of Clause 8. It could not be disputed that the employees were then acting within the scope of their duties or employment, thus bringing into play Section 19(c) of The Exchequer Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 34), by force of which this claim for injury to the property of the petitioners resulting from the negligence of the servants of the Crown could be determined against the Appellant.\nI have already said that the finding of the learned trial judge to the effect that there was in this matter negligence of the employees acting within the scope of their duties or employment could not be disturbed, and it follows that the Appellant was rightly condemned to pay the damages claimed by the Canada Steamship Lines, Limited, unless Clause 7 of the lease comes to the rescue of the Appellant.\nThe learned trial judge decided that it did not so operate. The ground for so deciding was that, in the opinion of the learned judge, the evidence has established that the fire, which destroyed the shed or warehouse in question and its contents, was caused by the gross negligence of the officers and servants of the Crown and that, in such a case, the Appellant could not invoke Clause 7.\nIt was common ground that the gross negligence referred to in the judgment appealed from is the equivalent of what is called \"faute lourde\" in the French Civil Code, and it was not disputed either that the lease must be interpreted and applied according to the law of the Province of Quebec.\nThe learned judge devoted almost the whole of his judgment to a discussion of what constituted \"faute lourde\". But, of course, the question whether \"faute lourde\" exists is not merely a question of fact; it is also a question of law. The facts found must be brought within the proper legal definition of \"faute lourde\".\nOn that point, it does not seem to me that one can be on safer grounds than to adopt the definition of POTHIER. This learned author, who might truly be looked upon as being in most respects the basis of the Civil Code of Quebec, says that the \"faute lourde consiste \u00e0 ne pas apporter aux affaires d'autrui le soin que les personnes les moins soigneuses et les plus stupides ne manquent pas d'apporter \u00e0 leurs affaires\".\nHere, the so-called \"faute lourde\", in the mind of the learned judge, would have resulted from the fact that, in order to enlarge a hole in a steel beam\u2014an operation which admittedly would not require more than three or four minutes at most\u2014the employees used an oxyacetylene torch and two experts testified that, instead of the torch, they should have used a drill or a reamer.\nAs the operation of the torch on the metal was expected to cause sparks to be emitted, the employees had installed a wooden beam or board, seven to eight feet long, nine to ten inches wide and one inch thick. The board started from the roof of the shed and came down to about three feet from the floor. The object of it was to prevent any spark flying from the spot of the operation unto bales of cotton waste stored in the shed. The bales incidentally caught fire and from there the fire spread all over the shed and destroyed all its contents. How the spark found its way to the bales of cotton waste, notwithstanding the board placed by the employees for the very purpose of preventing such an event, remained unexplained, as the whole occurrence happened so quickly that one of the employees, who had been placed inside the shed in order to guard against a possible mishap, had to escape hurriedly and did not even have time to use a pail of water which had been put at his disposal as an additional precaution. It should be stated, however, that in cross-examination, Newill, one of the experts heard, admitted that blow torches are used currently in many industries, in repairs to buildings and for the purpose of burning holes.\nThe judgments appealed from proceed to examine whether the Appellant could invoke any relief, under Clause 7 of the lease, and conclude as follows:\nAfter carefully perusing the doctrine set forth by the authors, French and Canadian, and adopted by the Courts of the Province of Quebec and the Supreme Court of Canada, with respect to the bearing of the exculpatory clause in the lease Exhibit A in the case of gross negligence, I have reached the conclusion that this clause does not exempt the respondent from his responsibility in connection with the damages suffered by the suppliant as a consequence of the fire.\nThe learned judge accordingly gave judgment in favour of the Suppliant against the Appellant.\nIt will be seen, therefore, that although recognizing that in the case of simple negligence (\"faute ordinaire\", \"faute l\u00e9g\u00e8re\"), Clause 7 would have operated as relieving the Appellant from any claim or demand for \"detriment, damage or injury of any nature\" to the \"materials, supplies, goods, articles, effects or things at any time brought, placed, made or being upon the said land, the said platform or in the said shed\"\u2014and that is to say, for the damages claimed in the Petition of Right of Canada Steamship Lines, Limited\u2014the Petitioner is entitled to recover in this particular case, because the employees of the Crown, in this instance, were guilty of gross negligence or of \"faute lourde\"; and that, in the premises, this circumstance prevented the Crown from obtaining relief under Clause 7.\nNo other ground can be found in the judgment for maintaining the Petition of Right against the Appellant in favour of the Respondent Canada Steamship Lines, Limited.\nThis calls, therefore, for the examination of two points: (1) Whether the facts justify a finding of \"faute lourde\" in the circumstances in this case; and (2) whether, in law, the existence of \"faute lourde\" would operate as an exception to the bearing of Clause 7 in the lease.\nApplying to the facts the definition of POTHIER above recited, I do not think, with respect, that it can be said that there was a \"faute lourde\" committed by the employees of the Crown. That definition goes extremely far; the words used by POTHIER are: \"\u2026 le soin que les personnes les moins soigneuses et les plus stupides ne manquent pas d'apporter \u00e0 leurs affaires\". Upon the evidence, I do not find it possible to state that the employees here can be placed in the category of \"les personnes les moins soigneuses et les plus stupides\".\nAs already stated, the evidence shows that the use of blow torches for the purpose of burning holes is made currently in many industries and by men of construction and demolition companies. The operation was to last only a few minutes. The men had no drill or reamer with them at the time. Stopping the work to go and get a drill or reamer might have meant a long delay and much inconvenience. It was only natural that for this extremely short work they should use the instruments or tools which they had immediately at hand. They were only doing what admittedly is being done currently in works of that kind. Moreover, they had taken the precautions which ordinarily and in their own mind would be adequate: the board installed between the place where they were burning the hole and the goods inside the shed; the pail of water; and the man placed on the bales of cotton waste, so that he could at once see a possible spark flying towards the bales and act on the spur of the moment to extinguish any beginning of a fire. It seems that it would be very exacting indeed to ask for any further precaution. It was both improbable and very nearly impossible to expect that a spark would reach the bales. It is enough to say that, under those circumstances, the finding that the employees were negligent and have caused the fire through such negligence should not be reversed by an Appellate Court, as was decided by this Court at the close of the Appellant's argument. With respect, I am unable to agree that what the men did was the act of \"les personnes les moins soigneuses et les plus stupides\". It is unnecessary, of course, to add that there can be here found neither \"faute intentionnelle\" nor \"faute volontaire\". And if, as many authors and commentators on the Civil Code think that, with very slight \"nuance\", the notion of \"faute lourde\" should be taken as the equivalent of \"dol\", it would be stressing the definition of \"faute lourde\" to its extreme limit to decide that the negligence of the Crown's employees amounted here to gross negligence or \"faute lourde\".\nThis would be sufficient to dispose of the ground upon which the learned trial judge refused to give to the Crown-Appellant the benefit of Clause 7 of the lease.\nBut it is not amiss to add that on the authorities and true interpretation of a clause, such as Clause 7, I could not either come to the conclusion that gross negligence or \"faute lourde\" should render Clause 7 inoperative. Since the decision of this Court in the case of The Glengoil Steamship Company v. Pilkington 3 the matter, in the Province of Quebec, must be taken to have been settled that a clause of that character is neither illegal nor void, and that the jurisprudence, both in France and in the Province of Quebec, now sanctions the validity of such a contract (Glengoil Case, Pages 156 and 157). It is generally admitted that such a stipulation of non-responsibility is not contrary to public order. This principle was reaffirmed by this Court in Vipond v. Furness, Withy and Company 4.\nThe leading case on that subject in the Province of Quebec is Canadian National Railway Company v. La Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al 5. This judgment was delivered for the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) by Surveyer J. It was there decided that\nLa clause d'un contrat stipulant immunit\u00e9 en faveur d'une partie, pour le cas de dommages susceptibles d'\u00eatre causes par sa propre faute, sans distinguer entre la faute contractuelle et la faute d\u00e9lictuelle, telle distinction n'existant pas dans notre loi,\u2014n'est pas contraire \u00e0 l'ordre public,\u2014est l\u00e9gale et valide.\u2014En cons\u00e9quence, dans l'esp\u00e8ce, une compagnie de chemin de fer dont la voie traverse \u00e0 niveau la rue d'une municipalit\u00e9, peut s'immuniser et se garantir par contrat avec la dite municipalit\u00e9 contre la responsabilit\u00e9 lui r\u00e9sultant d'accidents pouvant survenir \u00e0 la traverse, m\u00eame par la faute de ses propres employ\u00e9s.\nThe judgment relies on LAURENT, Vol. 16, No. 230; MARCADE, Vol. 4, Nos. 506-7; and a former judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) in Canadian Northern Quebec Railway Co. v. Argenteuil Lumber Company 6, where the Court of Appeal decided:\nA party to a contract may legally stipulate that he will not be responsible for the negligence of his employees. Therefore a clause in an agreement between a Railway Company and a private individual for the building of a siding, connecting with the company's railways, which purports to exempt the company from liability for injury or loss caused by its negligence or that of its servants in use of said siding, is not as being against public order, as far as the fault of the company's employees is concerned.\nThe same judgment cites SIREY, 1882-2-24, to the effect that the definition of \"faute lourde\" in France is: \"La faute commise \u00e0 dessein et en pleine connaissance de cause\". This clearly cannot be applied to the negligence of the Crown's employees in the present case, and we should add that, if such be the law as between private litigants, a fortiori should the Crown be given the benefit of such law in view of the limited responsibility of the Crown in these matters.\nClause 7 itself provides for no exception whatever. It covers \"any claim or demand \u2026 for detriment, damage or injury of any nature \u2026 to materials, supplies, goods, articles, effects or things at any time brought, placed, made or being upon the said land, the said platform or in the said shed\".\nIt is obvious that the clause covers the goods, articles, effects or things, the damage or injury to which is claimed for by the Petitioner-Respondent in the premises. There could be no possible exception to the non-liability of the Appellant under the clause.\nApplying Articles 1013 and following of the Civil Code dealing with the interpretation of contracts, I must say that, here, the meaning of the parties is not doubtful, it is not susceptible of two meanings, and, although the terms are quite general and all-embracing, I cannot see how they could be said not to extend to the goods destroyed by the fire in the present case, nor is it evident that the parties did not intend to contract to cover those goods (C.C. 1020).\nBoth on the interpretation of the clause in accordance with the Civil Code, as well as in law and on the facts, I am of opinion that Clause 7 of the lease between His Majesty and Canada Steamship Lines, Limited, should receive its application and the Petition of Right of Canada Steamship Lines, Limited, should be dismissed with costs, in this Court and in the Exchequer Court.\nDealing now with the Third Party proceedings, they were all dismissed by the learned trial judge again on the ground that the existence of \"faute lourde\", as he found, should exclude the right of the Appellant to be indemnified by the Respondent Canada Steamship Lines, Limited. This calls for a discussion of the effect of Clause 17 of the lease.\nIn that connection, I need not repeat what is already said above on whether the negligence of the Crown's employees can be styled gross negligence or \"faute lourde\". My conclusion on the facts leads to a decision that none could be found in the circumstances of this case. It would follow that the ground of the learned trial judge for excluding Clause 17 is not well founded.\nThere remains, however, to interpret Clause 17 and to see whether, upon its true construction, the Appellant was entitled to call upon the Respondent Canada Steamship Lines, Limited, to indemnify Him and save Him harmless from the claims of the other Petitioners.\nFor that purpose, Clause 17 may be divided into two parts: the first part reads:\nThat the Lessee shall at all times indemnify and save harmless the Lessor from and against all claims and demands, loss, costs, damages, actions, suits or other proceedings by whomsoever made, brought or prosecuted \u2026\nIt does not seem doubtful that this first part upholds the contention of the Appellant.\nactions \u2026 brought or prosecuted, in any manner based upon, occasioned by or attributable to the execution of these Presents, or any action taken or things done or maintained by virtue hereof, or the exercise in any manner of rights arising hereunder.\nHere, the enquiry must be whether the actions brought by H. J. Heinz Company of Canada, Limited; Cunningham and Wells, Limited; Raymond Copping; W. H. Taylor, Limited, and Canada and Dominion Sugar Company, Limited, are included within the actions, suits or proceedings enumerated and specified in that last part.\nUndoubtedly, unless it were so, it would be difficult to attribute a meaning to that clause, although the rule of interpretation contained in Article 1014 of the Code states that:\nWhen a clause is susceptible of two meanings, it must be understood in that in which it may have some effect rather than in that in which it can produce none.\nIt would not follow, therefore, that the mere fact of coming to the conclusion that the clause might produce no effect would be sufficient to dispose of the present discussion. Article 1014 contemplates that there may be clauses in contracts which are susceptible of producing no effect, if no meaning can be attributed to them. It is only when a clause is susceptible of two meanings that preference must be given to the meaning having some effect rather than to the meaning which produces none.\nHere, however, after the most careful consideration, I cannot find two meanings in Clause 17.\nThe Crown is seeking to be indemnified by Canada Steamship Lines, Limited, and to be saved harmless from and against claims and demands, suits or proceedings brought against it for loss, costs and damages based upon, occasioned by or attributable to the execution of the lease.\nAs we have seen, Clause 8 thereof compelled the Crown \"at all times during the currency of the lease, at its own cost and expense, to maintain the shed\" in which the goods destroyed by the fire had been placed and were then in the shed. Maintaining the shed was one of the obligations of the Crown arising under the lease and attributable to the performance or execution of the lease. The loss, cost or damages to the other claimants or Petitioners, which form the basis for the Third Party proceedings against the Respondent Canada Steamship Lines, Limited, are certain claims and demands for their loss, cost and damages in actions, suits or proceedings brought or prosecuted in a manner attributable to the execution and performance of the lease by the Crown; and, accordingly, they are brought strictly within the application of Clause 17. This, to my mind, was exactly the intention of the parties to the lease when the latter was agreed to between them. The result, of course, is unfortunate because it has the effect of placing upon the shoulders of the Canada Steamship Lines, Limited, the full burden of the damages which resulted from the fire caused by the negligence of the employees of the Appellant; but the law of the contract is the law of the parties; and this result is brought about only as a consequence of the stipulations to which the Lessee submitted itself when it signed the lease. And it is not unnatural that, having rented the shed to Canada Steamship Lines, Limited, the Crown should have insisted that, if any loss occurred during the currency of the lease and such loss was claimed against the Crown, it, in turn, would be entitled to be indemnified and saved harmless by the Lessee. Canada Steamship Lines, Limited, agreed to that, and, in deciding that the Third Party proceedings must be maintained against it, the Court is only applying the inevitable result and consequence of what it agreed to.\nI am, for all these reasons, of opinion that the judgments must be confirmed in so far as are concerned the petitions of H. J. Heinz Company of Canada, Limited; Cunningham and Wells, Limited; Raymond Copping; W. H. Taylor, Limited, and Canada and Dominion Sugar Co., Limited, and the appeals from these judgments should be dismissed with costs; but the appeal should be maintained as against Canada Steamship Lines, Limited, both in respect to its own petition against His Majesty and also with regard to the Third Party proceedings, which ought to be maintained against it in each case of H. J. Heinz Company of Canada, Limited; Cunningham and Wells, Limited; Raymond Copping; W. H. Taylor, Limited, and Canada and Dominion Sugar Co., Limited. The judgments rendered in favour of Canada Steamship Lines, Limited, on its own petition and on the Third Party proceedings should, therefore, be set aside; its petition should be dismissed and the Third Party proceedings maintained against it, together with all costs in each instance in favour of the Appellant both in this Court and in the Exchequer Court.\nRand J.:\u2014On the argument, the Court intimated that, notwithstanding Mr. Campbell's able argument, the finding of Angers, J. 7 on the facts could not be disturbed. There remain, therefore, three questions: first, whether under paragraph 7 of the lease, the Crown is exempt from liability for the loss suffered by the respondent; whether, under paragraph 17, the Crown is entitled to call upon the respondent for indemnity against the claims of the third parties; and whether the negligence was \"faute lourde\" against which, it is contended, an indemnity would be contrary to public order.\nParagraph 7 is as follows:\u2014\nThat the Lessee shall not have any claim or demand against the Lessor for detriment, damage or injury of any nature to the said land, the said shed, the said platform and the said canopy, or to any motor or other vehicles, materials, supplies, goods, articles, effects or things at any time brought, placed, made or being upon the said land, the said platform or in the said shed.\nAs can be seen, this language is broad enough to embrace every claim against the Crown for damage to any property of the respondent in or on the land leased. For example, an aeroplane of the Air Force might, through negligence, get out of control and crash through the building, or sparks from a locomotive on the government railway might set fire to it. But they are claims against the \"Lessor\" and this means that they must arise within some scope of action under the lease. Are they, on the one hand, to be limited to damage resulting from breaches of covenant? The only express obligation on the Crown is that to maintain the \"said shed exclusive of the said platform and the said canopy\". Under the law of Quebec, which the parties take as governing, the duty to repair would arise after notification by the lessee. The Crown might deliberately or negligently delay such work in circumstances that might lead to damage, as, say, from rain or other inclemency of weather. The mere breach of the covenant, without damage to property, would be outside the paragraph. Or, on the other hand, are the parties to be presumed to have had in mind consequences incidental to any act arising out of the relation of lessor and lessee? Before coming to a conclusion on this question, I think it advisable to examine paragraph 17.\nThat paragraph reads:\u2014\nThat the Lessee shall at all times indemnify and save harmless the Lessor from and against all claims and demands, loss, costs, damages, actions, suits or other proceedings by whomsoever made, brought or prosecuted, in any manner based upon, occasioned by or attributable to the execution of these Presents, or any action taken or things done or maintained by virtue hereof, or the exercise in any manner of rights arising hereunder.\nThe question here is this: what claims of third parties could arise against the Crown within the scope of matters bounded by the lease? There could be no contractual rights or duties: at most only delicts or quasi-delicts. But the non-liability of the Crown for wrongs done to the subject is a basic constitutional rule which was the law of Lower Canada in 1807 and remains the constitutional position of the Crown except so far as it has been changed by statute: Quebec v. The King 8. The Exchequer Court Act, by section 19(c), has created a right in the subject where he has been injured or his property damaged by the negligence of an employee of the Crown in the course of his duty and any liability within the Province of Quebec must arise out of such a delinquency. The only possible claims, then, within paragraph 17, are those founded in negligence.\nThe rule striking negligence from exceptions of liability arose out of the interpretation of contracts of carriage both by sea and by land. The nature of those undertakings as well as the early conditions under which they were performed dictated an insurer's responsibility against loss or damage unless caused by an Act of God, the King's enemies or inherent vice, to which there was added by law the obligation to use care, and in the case of ships, that they be seaworthy. But although the rule is not now confined to carriers, the researches of counsel have turned up no case of property which has not involved a bailment. The common factor in all has been the commitment of personal property by one person to another, a relationship in many instances of which duties by law and obligations by contract have not been wholly and satisfactorily integrated. But there is no such relation here and the rule must be examined anew.\nThe first question for a court is the rational consideration upon which the rule is based. In examining that, I disregard both the fact that the Crown is landlord and the ordinary rule of interpretation in the case of Crown grants. Since the matter is primarily in contract, the exception should appear as the presumed intention of the parties. In sea carriage there were obvious perils to be encountered, and if the ship owner stipulated for freedom from them, without more, it would be reasonable to assume that misconduct on his part was not contemplated. In some, at least, of the exceptions, the result could be explained in terms of causation, Although a peril was the immediate cause, yet as it was engaged with negligence, on the ordinary reasoning the loss would be attributed to the latter. But it was not only against negligence that the rule struck. The warranty of seaworthiness was in substance absolute, and yet, its breach, regardless of the nature or cause of it, was excluded from general exceptions or from exceptions of specific causes with which it co-operated.\nOne test would seem to be whether the words of exemption can be given a reasonable application short of negligence, as was suggested by Atkin, L.J. (as he was) in Rutter v. Palmer 9. In the lease before us, the Crown has undertaken only one obligation, to maintain the building, and the only sources of liability are, failure to maintain and negligent performance. It is said that the former is within section 7 and the latter not. But what, in reasonableness, is the difference between a culpable refusal to carry out an obligation, which involves either an intentional or negligent disregard of it, and the performance in good faith but accompanied by less than reasonable care? If, for instance, the electric wiring of this building had, through deterioration, become dangerous, precisely the same results might have followed the neglect to repair as in this case; and if it goes to the reasonableness or even morality of the default, how can it be said that either one is more reasonable or more unreasonable than the other? I am unable to appreciate any jural distinction between them. As in the cases where unseaworthiness has overridden exceptions, it is irrelevant that there might be liability which did not involve culpability, although I should add that I do not see how there could be here.\nReverting, then, to paragraph 7 and considering it in the light of paragraph 17, it would seem rather absurd to say that the fire, so far as it damaged the goods of a third party, gave rise to a right in the Crown against the Steamship Company for indemnity, which, in my opinion, it would; but that claims for damage to like property of the Steamship Company were not within the broad language of paragraph 7.\nIt will be noticed that, although the duty to repair does not extend to the canopy or the platform, additions to the building made by the lessee, these are enumerated in paragraph 7. Damage to them arising out of a failure to repair the main part of the building can perhaps be imagined, but it would be very remote in cause and beyond any likely contemplation of the parties. It would seem much more probable that direct damage to them was in mind, a claim for which could be only from a negligent act.\nThe last question is whether the negligence in the work done was of such an outrageous character as to bring it within the principle of faute lourde. In view of the development of the law of insurance in the province and its radical departure from the Coutume de Paris, it would seem to be very questionable that the principle could now be invoked at all; but assuming it could, the scope would not in these days extend beyond the bounds laid down by Pothier in his definition:\u2014\ndans le fait de ne pas apporter aux affaires d'autrui le soin que les personnes les moins soigneuses et les plus stupides ne manquent pas d'apporter \u00e0 leurs affaires.\nIt cannot seriously be contended that the conduct of these employees was of the character so described. They were doing their work in the ordinary manner; they had anticipated the possibility of sparks and had taken some considerable, and what they thought to be adequate, precautions against them. To say of their conduct that it was more indifferent than the most careless and the most stupid of men would exercise towards their own interests is either to disregard what they did or to misconceive the standard laid down.\nThe result is simply this: the Crown leases on terms that under no circumstances will it be responsible for damage to any property on the land: to the lessee it is said: you must bear that entire risk, against which you may, of course, insure yourself. As the respondent is a carrier, in custody of all the goods as such or as warehouseman, that risk is part at least of its ordinary responsibility: and in the work of repair, it is as if the persons doing it were employees of the respondent but at the cost of the Crown.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal, dismiss the petition of right and allow judgment on the counterclaim for indemnity, with costs in this Court and in the Court below.\nKellock J.:\u2014This is an appeal by His Majesty from a judgment of the Exchequer Court 10 in proceedings arising out of the destruction by fire of certain goods, the property of the respondent and certain third parties. The respondent, Canada Steamship Lines, was the tenant of certain dock property under lease from the appellant upon part of which property was situate a freight shed which the Steamship Company used in connection with its business of transporting freight. The lease is dated the 18th of November, 1940, and is for a term of twelve years. Under its provisions the lessee had the right to construct, at its own expense, a loading platform along the southerly face of the freight shed and a canopy above. It also provided that the appellant would, during the currency of the lease, maintain the shed but not the platform or canopy.\nFive or six days prior to the fire, the Steamship Company had complained to the appellant's superintendent as to the state of repair of the various doors in the shed and it was in the course of the repair of these doors on the 5th of May, 1944, by servants of the appellant that the fire occurred, completely destroying the shed and its contents.\nThe learned trial judge held that the fire was due to the negligence of the appellant's servants and we affirmed this finding on the hearing, subject to the question as to whether the negligence amounted to gross negligence, and the effect, if any, of such a finding. Judgment was given in favour of the Steamship Company against the appellant and also judgment in favour of the third parties. The learned judge further held that clause 7 of the lease, to be hereinafter referred to, could not be availed of by the appellant as a defence to the Steamship Company's claim, as he considered that under the law of Quebec such a clause was no answer where there had been gross negligence or \"faute lourde\". He also refused relief to the appellant against the Steamship Company in third party proceedings taken for the purpose of indemnification against the claims of the third parties. The learned judge held that clause 17 of the lease upon which the appellant relied for this purpose could not be made available for the same reason.\nIn my opinion the judgment in appeal cannot be sustained upon the ground upon which the learned trial judge proceeded. The definition of faute lourde most favourable to the respondent Steamship Company, namely, that of Pothier, is:\ndans le fait de ne pas apporter aux affaires d'autrui le soin que les personnes les moins soigneuses et les plus stupides ne manquent pas d'apporter \u00e0 leurs affaires. Even accepting this definition for the purposes of the present case, the evidence does not make out such a case.\nClause 7, relied upon by the appellant as a defence to the claim of the respondent company, reads as follows:\nThat the Lessee shall not have any claim or demand against the Lessor for detriment, damage or injury of any nature to the said land, the said shed, the said platform and the said canopy, or to any motor or other vehicles, materials, supplies, goods, articles, effects or things at any time brought, placed, made or being upon the said land, the said platform or in the said shed.\nPrior to the decision of this court in Glengoil v. Pilkington 11, all such clauses were considered invalid by the courts of the Province of Quebec, but as stated by Taschereau J. in Grand Trunk Railway v. Miller 12:\nThe legality of such clauses was concluded by that decision.\nIn the course of his judgment in the Glengoil case, Taschereau J. said at 159:\nThen conditions of this nature limiting the carrier's liability or relieving him from any, are to be construed strictly and must not be extended to any cases but those expressly specified; Phillips v. Clark, 2 C.B. N.S. 156; Trainor v. the Black Diamond Steamship Co., 16 S.C.R. 156.\nIt is well settled that a clause of this nature is not to be construed as extending to protect the person in whose favour it is made from the consequences of the negligence of his own servants unless there is express language to that effect or unless the clause can have no operation except as applied to such a case. In Alderslade v. Hendon Laundry 13, Lord Greene M.R. expressed the principle as follows at page 245:\n\u2026 where the head of damage in respect of which limitation of liability is sought to be imposed by such a clause is one which rests on negligence and nothing else, the clause must be construed as extending to that head of damage, because if it were not so construed it would lack subject-matter. Where, on the other hand, the head of damage may be based on some ground other than that of negligence, the general principle is that the clause must be confined to loss occurring \u2026 through that other cause to the exclusion of loss arising through negligence. The reason for that is that if a contracting party wishes in such a case to limit his liability in respect of negligence, he must do so in clear terms, and in the absence of such clear terms the clause is to be construed as relating to a different kind of liability and not to liability based on negligence.\nIt is therefore argued for the respondent in the case at bar that the provisions of paragraph 7 do not extend to exonerate the Crown from its liability under the provisions of section 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act for the reason that negligence is not expressly mentioned and need not of necessity be implied as, under the provisions of the lease itself, circumstances could have arisen entailing liability upon the Crown apart altogether from negligence.\nUnder the provisions of paragraph 8 of the lease, the Crown had covenanted to maintain the freight shed during the currency of the lease. It is said that goods in the shed might well be damaged because of non-repair occasioned by mere delay or non-availability of materials or labour, altogether apart from negligence. The Crown is liable for breach of contract whether the breach lie in omission or commission: Windsor v. The Queen 14. The argument, therefore, is that in such case, clause 7 would operate to bar any relief by the appellant in respect of damage to its goods and therefore its provisions should not be construed as including claims for damage arising from negligence in the execution of repairs.\nBefore dealing with this argument, it will be convenient to refer to the appellant's claim against the respondent for indemnity in respect of the claims of the third parties. The appellant invokes against the respondent in this connection the provisions of paragraph 17 of the lease, which reads as follows:\nThat the Lessee shall at all times indemnify and save harmless the Lessor from and against all claims and demands, loss, costs, damages, actions, suits or other proceedings by whomsoever made, brought or prosecuted, in any manner based upon, occasioned by or attributable to the execution of these Presents, or any action taken or things done or maintained by virtue hereof, or the exercise in any manner of rights arising hereunder.\nThe principle already discussed in considering the terms of paragraph 7 is equally pertinent as to the construction of paragraph 17, but in my opinion the terms of paragraph 17 protect the Crown in respect of claims of third parties against it for damages occasioned by the negligence of its servants. No such person could have any claim against the Crown in circumstances which would ensue upon the granting of the lease except on a basis other than contract. That being so, I think the clause must be taken to extend to claims for damages by reason of negligent acts of Crown servants such as that here in question. Such claim would be a claim \"occasioned by or attributable to\" an \"action taken or thing done by virtue hereof\", namely, the action of the Crown's employees in carrying out the obligation to repair imposed upon the Crown by the lease to repair the shed. \"By virtue\" of the lease is equivalent to \"as a consequence of\" or \"because of.\"\nWith respect to paragraph 7, it may well be that if that paragraph stood alone, the respondent's argument would be valid. I do not need to decide that question, however, but will assume its soundness for the purposes of the present case. Paragraph 7 does not stand alone, and in my opinion the presence in the lease of paragraph 17 affects the proper interpretation to be given to paragraph 7.\nThe respondent is a water carrier subject to the provisions of the Water Carriage of Goods Act, 1 Edward VIII c. 49, and to the rules relating to bills of lading set out in the schedule to that Act. By Article IV para. 2, the carrier is not liable for loss or damage arising from fire unless caused by its actual fault or privity. Accordingly, the respondent would not, under the terms of the article just mentioned, be liable to the owner of goods lost by reason of the fire here in question, even though the goods were in the possession of the respondent as carrier and not as warehouseman. However, it is provided by Article V that\nA carrier shall be at liberty to surrender in whole or in part all or any of his rights and immunities or to increase any of his responsibilities and liabilities under the Rules contained in any of these Articles, provided such surrender or increase shall be embodied in the bill of lading issued to the shipper.\nAt all times since the passage of this statute, then, it was open to the carrier to waive the benefit of Article IV para. 2 and to accept goods for carriage on terms involving it in liability, even though a loss took place without any negligence on the part of the carrier or its servants or agents.\nThis being an express provision in the law at the time of the execution of the lease here in question, I think it must be taken that the lease was executed in the light of the possibility of the respondent having goods from time to time in its possession in the demised premises for the loss of which, arising from circumstances such as are here in question, it would be liable to the shipper as insurer and therefore entitled itself to recover against a wrong-doer for such loss.\nIn my opinion, the respondent, under such circumstances, would have sufficient interest within the meaning of Article 77 of the Code of Civil Procedure to maintain such an action. It would be illogical that an action for revendication at the suit of a depositary should lie under Article 946 where the article is still in existence, and at the same time that the depositary would have no right of action against a wrong-doer for damages if the article had been destroyed. I think the principle is correctly stated in Fuzier-Herman, R\u00e9pertoire vo Action en justice, no. 95, referred to by Guerin J. in B\u00e9lisle v. Labranche 15 as follows:\nL'int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir doit \u00eatre un int\u00e9r\u00eat imm\u00e9diat, dit \u00e0 cette \u00e9gard M. Garsonnet et, suivant la formule, n\u00e9 et actuel; mais il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 raison duquel on agit soit encore r\u00e9alis\u00e9 ni que l'exercice du droit qu'on veut d\u00e9fendre soit d\u00e8s maintenant entrav\u00e9, car il peut-\u00eatre utile de pr\u00e9venir un dommage imminent, ou de se mettre un droit \u00e0 l'abri d'une contestation ult\u00e9rieure.\nThis being so, it would be an anomaly if, upon claim being made by the shipper upon the appellant, the respondent would be liable to indemnify the appellant under the provisions of paragraph 17, and yet that the respondent, if called upon to pay directly by the shipper, could recover from the appellant on the ground of the negligence of its servants, and paragraph 7 of the lease would not be the answer. I therefore think it must be held that paragraph 7 would be an answer to such a claim and that it must be read as applying to causes of action founded upon negligence. The appeal should therefore be allowed with costs here and below.\nEstey J.:\u2014At the hearing of this appeal the Court affirmed the finding of the learned trial Judge 16 that the fire here in question was caused by the negligence of the appellant's agents and servants acting in the course of their employment. The Court, however, did not affirm the learned trial Judge's view that the negligence was such as to constitute \"faute lourde\" or \"gross negligence.\" \"Faute lourde\" is discussed by a number of French authors and the definition more generally accepted is that of Pothier: \"dans le fait de ne pas apporter aux affaires d'autrui le soin que les personnes les moins soigneuses et les plus stupides ne manquent pas d'apporter \u00e0 leurs affaires.\" In this case the servants and agents did take some precautions and, with respect, I do not think their conduct was so wanton or reckless as to constitute \"faute lourde.\"\nThe appellant, therefore, by virtue of sec. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act is liable for the damage suffered by respondent Canada Steamship Lines Limited unless it is protected therefrom by virtue of the provisions of clause 7 of the lease:\n7. That the Lessee shall not have any claim or demand against the Lessor for detriment, damage or injury of any nature to the said land, the said shed, the said platform and the said canopy, or to any motor or other vehicles, materials, supplies, goods, articles, effects or things at any time brought, placed, made or being upon the said land, the said platform, or in the said shed.\nThe language of this paragraph is sufficiently comprehensive to include claims and demands founded in negligence, but it is submitted by respondent that it should not be so construed. In this submission it is emphasized that the word \"negligence\" does not appear throughout the paragraph and while its absence is not conclusive, without it the language must be such as to admit of no other reasonable construction. That this clause 7 should be construed as to limit its application to breach of covenant in the lease and as there is no breach the clause has no application.\nThis type of clause first appeared in contracts with respect to the carriage of goods. The common carrier who defaulted in his obligations to carry goods at common law was liable irrespective of the cause, except it was the King's enemies, acts of God or inherent vice of the goods. The common carrier in order to protect himself from such liability began inserting protective clauses in the contract for carriage. These have, apart from clear language to the contrary, been construed to reduce his liability but not to the extent of excluding that due to his own negligence or that of his servants or agents, unless there was an express provision to that effect or language that permitted of no other reasonable construction. The agreement here is a lease and not a contract with a common carrier. MacKinnon, L. J., in Alderslade v. Hendon Laundry Ltd. 17, in a case where articles were lost by a laundry and where a clause limiting liability had to be construed, stated at p. 247:\nReliance upon cases between shipowners and owners of goods is illusory.\nSimilar clauses in contracts other than those with common carriers for the carriage of goods are discussed in Reynolds v. Boston Deep Sea Co. 18; Rutter v. Palmer 19; Beaumont-Thomas v. Blue Star Line Ltd. 20; Alderslade v. Hendon Laundry Ltd., supra.\nThat which determines the matter is the intention of the parties as expressed in the language of the clause as construed in association with the contract as a whole. In cases of difficulty or doubt in the construction of these clauses in contracts other than those with common carriers the authorities suggest two rules. Where liability exists in addition to that founded in negligence, the Courts have, as stated by Lord Greene, followed the general principle and restricted the exemption of liability to that other than that founded upon negligence. Alderslade v. Hendon Laundry Ltd., supra, at p. 245. If, however, negligence be the only basis for liability the clause will, as Lord Justice Scrutton stated, \"more readily operate to exempt\" liability based upon negligence: Rutter v. Palmer, supra, at p. 92.\nIn this case the appellant as lessor under clause 5 reserved \"at all times full and free access\" to any part of the land, shed and platform, and under clause 8 undertook to \"maintain said shed.\" This at least included the obligation to keep the shed in repair. Clause 7, notwithstanding its comprehensive terms, has been so drafted that it does not exempt the appellant from damages incurred when the appellant makes default in his obligation to repair and the respondent, as tenant, in that event makes the same and claims the cost thereof by way of damages from the lessor. In that event there is no \"claim or demand \u2026 for detriment, damage or injury \u2026\" to the objects specified in clause 7 and therefore its provisions would not exempt the lessor. This is significant, and particularly so in relation to the respondent's contention that the clause should be restricted in its application to a breach of covenant in the lease. The clause has obviously been drafted with care and the non-exemption of the aforementioned liability cannot be regarded as accidental. That a clause drafted not to include one form of liability but otherwise in such general all-inclusive terms should be given such a restricted meaning as here contended for would appear to be contrary to the intent of the parties.\nThen it must be assumed that clause 7 was drafted with reference to detriment, damage or injury to the premises, property or freight. In the preparation thereof the parties would have in mind at least the more likely sources or causes of liability on the part of the lessor. It would therefore be liability for damages arising out of the exercise of the privilege of access or duty to maintain that would be uppermost in their minds. In respect to the former any liability arising therefrom would almost invariably be founded on negligent conduct. As to the latter the lessee being in possession would notify the landlord of the need for repair. If any detriment, damage or injury should occur to the premises, goods or freight after the notice and prior to the completion of the repairs, it would more likely arise from neglect on the part of the lessor, his servants and agents. It must be assumed, therefore, that the parties in drafting that clause would fully appreciate that the most probable source of liability upon the lessor would be negligent conduct.\nAt the hearing it was suggested that detriment, damage or injury to the goods and property might result from the collapse of a shed or breaking of a water main or some other source quite apart from any question of negligence and that clauses 7 and 17 should apply only to such liability. These possibilities of detriment, damage or injury to the goods and property are, in comparison to the possibility of such from negligence, so remote as to make it unreasonable to conclude that the parties, having regard to the language of clauses 7 and 17, intended to so restrict the exemption therein provided for.\nClause 17 of the lease reads as follows:\n17. That the Lessee shall at all times indemnify and save harmless the Lessor from and against all claims and demands, loss, costs, damages, actions, suits or other proceedings by whomsoever made, brought or prosecuted, in any manner based upon, occasioned by or attributable to the execution of these Presents, or any action taken or things done or maintained by virtue hereof, or the exercise in any manner of rights arising hereunder.\nThese clauses 7 and 17 must be read and construed together and as part of the lease as a whole. Clause 17 is drafted in language of the widest import. The respondent, Canada Steamship Lines Ltd., apart from emphasizing the fact that \"negligence\" is not used in the paragraph, refers particularly to the words \"any action taken or things done or maintained by virtue hereof\" and \"the exercise in any manner of rights arising hereunder.\" These statements, it was submitted, limit the clause to where the action taken or the things done or the exercise of the right would be done in a legal and proper manner and therefore to the exclusion of the negligent doing or taking of the steps contemplated. The inclusion of such phrases as \"any action\" and the words \"in any manner\" would appear not to support the contention made on behalf of the Canada Steamship Lines Ltd. However, when these portions are read with the other parts of clause 17 one is led to the conclusion that the parties are here providing for liability not in a restricted but rather in a general sense including liability founded in negligence. Indeed, unless liability for negligence be included in this clause 17 it lacks subject-matter or content.\nIt is conceded that liability may under clause 7 arise apart from that founded on negligence, but the authorities already mentioned make it clear that such a fact is significant as an aid in determining intention but is not conclusive. It is the expressed intention of the parties that concludes the issue. This intention is made rather clear in clause 17 and when these clauses are read together, as they must be, with due regard to the relationship between the parties (landlord and tenant) and their respective positions, rights and obligations under the lease, they do not support the view that in respect to liability founded upon negligence there should be any difference in the effect of the two clauses. It, therefore, follows that the lessor is exempt under both clauses for liability founded on negligence.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs. Locke J. (dissenting in part):\u2014The petition of right filed by the respondent, Canada Steamship Lines, Limited, alleges a cause of action for negligence on the part of the employees and servants of the Crown. There was ample evidence, in my opinion, to support the finding of the learned trial judge 21 that the fire resulted from such negligence and it was intimated before the conclusion of the argument that we would not disturb this finding. If, however, Pothier's definition of faute lourde be accepted, it is, in my opinion, clear that the actions of the servants of the Crown could not be so classified. They took precautions to avoid damage from sparks but these proved inadequate. Difficult as it is to attempt to define what constitutes gross negligence, I see no justification for a finding that there was any such here, or faute lourde within the above mentioned definition.\nBy the lease of November 18, 1940, between His Majesty and this respondent it was recited that the lessor demised and leased unto the lessee the property in question, together with the right to use and occupy it for the purpose of receiving and storing therein freight and goods loaded into or unloaded from vessels owned or operated by the lessee, and the term of the lease was expressed to be 12 years from May 1, 1940. By paragraph 8 it was agreed that the lessor would at all times during the currency of the lease, at his own cost and expense, maintain the shed erected upon the premises leased. It was in pursuance of the obligation thus assumed that the servants of the Crown went upon the premises to carry out the repairs to the door of the shed and it was their negligence in performing the work which forms the basis of the action. It is to be noted that the claim pleaded sounds in tort and not in contract. This was, in my opinion, the true nature of the plaintiff's claim. In Pollock on Torts, 14th Ed. at 427, the learned author says:\u2014\nIf a man will set about actions attended with risk to others, the law casts on him the duty of care and competence. It is equally immaterial that the defendant may have bound himself to do the act or to do it competently. The undertaking, if undertaking there was in that sense, is but the occasion and inducement of the wrong. From this root we have as a direct gnowth the whole modern doctrine of negligence. The point is of importance in construing paragraph 7 of the lease which reads:\u2014\nThat the lessee shall not have any claim or demand against the lessor for detriment, damage or injury of any nature to the said land, the said shed, the said platform and the said canopy, or to any motor or other vehicles, materials, supplies, goods, articles, effects or things at any time brought, placed, made or being upon the said land, the said platform or in the said shed.\nClaims for damage or injury to property caused by negligence are not specifically excepted, but the words \"any claim or demand against the lessor\" however, if given an unrestricted meaning, affords a complete answer to the claim of this respondent.\nIn the case of a common carrier it is, in my opinion, clear that a clause similar to paragraph 7 would not relieve him of liability for negligence. In Phillips v. Clark 22, a shipowner who had stipulated in the bill of lading that he was \"not to be accountable for leakage or breakage\" was found liable for a loss by these means arising from negligence. Cockburn, C.J. said in part (p. 162):\u2014\nAdmitting that a carrier may protect himself from liability for loss or damage to goods intrusted to him to carry, even if occasioned by negligence on the part of himself or his servants, provided any one is willing to contract with him on such terms; yet it seems to me that we ought not to put such a construction upon the contract as is here contended for, when it is susceptible of another and a more reasonable one. It is not to be supposed that the plaintiff intended that the defendant should be exempted from the duty of taking ordinary care of the goods that were intrusted to him. When it is borne in mind what is the ordinary duty of a carrier, it is plain what the parties intended here. So long ago as in the case of Dale v. Hall, 1 Wils. 201, it is laid down (by Lee, C.J.) that \"everything is a negligence in a carrier or hoyman that the law does not excuse, and he is answerable for goods the instant he receives them into his custody, and in all events, except they happen to be damaged by the act of God or the King's enemies; and a promise to carry safely, is a promise to keep safely.\" Amongst the events which the carrier here would under ordinary circumstances be responsible for, are, leakage and breakage. He stipulates to be exempted from the liability which the law would otherwise cast upon him in these respects. But there is no reason why, because he is by the terms of the contract relieved from that liability, we should hold that the plaintiff intended also to exempt him from any of the consequences arising from his negligence. The contract being susceptible of two constructions, I think we are bound to put that construction upon it which is the more consonant to reason and common sense; and to hold that it was only intended to exempt him from his ordinary common law liability, and not from responsibility for damage resulting from negligence. Cresswell, J. said (p. 163):\u2014\nOrdinarily, the master undertakes to take due and proper care of goods intrusted to him for conveyance, and to stow them properly; and he is responsible for leakage and breakage. Here he expressly stipulates not to be accountable for leakage or breakage, leaving the rest as before.\nIn Price v. Union Lighterage Company 23, goods were loaded on a barge under a contract for carriage whereby the barge owner was exempted from liability \"for any loss or damage to goods which can be covered by insurance.\" The barge was sunk owing to the negligence of the servants of the barge owner and the goods were lost. It was held that the exemption being in general terms not expressly relating to negligence the barge owner was not relieved of liability for loss or damage caused by the negligence of his servants.\nThe risk of loss was clearly one against which insurance might have been obtained but Lord Alverstone, C.J. after pointing this out said (416):\u2014\nThe question, however, is not whether these words could be made to cover such a loss, but whether in a contract for carriage they include on a reasonable construction, an exemption from negligence on the part of the carrier. We have only to look at the case to which I have referred, and in particular to Sutton v. Ciceri, 15 A.C. 144, to see that the words of this contract can receive a contractual and business like construction and have effect without including in the exemption the consequences of the negligence of the carrier. That being so, the principle that to exempt the carrier from liability for the consequences of his negligence there must be words that make it clear that the parties intended that there should be such an exemption is applicable to this case and the learned judge was right in holding that the contract does not exempt the defendants from liability for their own negligence.\nIn Rutter v. Palmer 24, the defendant, a garage owner, was sued by a customer who had delivered a car into his possession for the purpose of sale. In holding that the terms of the contract there made protected the defendant from a claim based upon negligence, Atkin, L.J. explained the principle upon which the common carrier cases were decided in these terms (p. 94):\u2014\nThere is a class of contracts in which words purporting in general terms to exempt a party from \"any loss\" or to provide that \"any loss\" shall be borne by the other party, have been held insufficient to exempt from liability for negligence. Those are contracts of carriage by sea or land. The liability of the carrier is not confined to his acts of negligence or those of his servants; it extends beyond liability for negligence; therefore when a clause in the contract exempts the carrier from any loss it may have a reasonable meaning even though the exemption falls short of conferring immunity for acts of negligence. That is the reason at the root of the shipping cases. The same reason does not so often apply to the railway cases because, when acting as carriers, railways generally come under special legislation. But where in the circumstances a railway company is exposed to one kind of liability only, and that is a liability for negligence, there if the parties agree that the risk of loss or damage is to be borne by the passenger or the owner of goods they must intend to exempt the company from liability in the only event which is likely to expose them to liability; that is the negligence of their servants.\nAs opposed to the decisions in the common carrier cases are those where what may be called clauses providing exemption from liability in general terms have been found effective on the ground that, since the only possible claim would be for negligence, the parties must be held to have intended to exclude such liability. In McCawley v. Furness Railway Company 25, a passenger on the defendant railway claimed damages for personal injuries caused by the negligent management of the train. The defendant pleaded that the plaintiff had been received to be carried under a free pass as the drover accompanying cattle, one of the terms of which was that he should travel at his own risk. By replication, the plaintiff alleged that it was by reason of the negligence of the defendant that the accident had happened and on demurrer it was held that the replication was bad. Cockburn, C.J. said that the terms of the agreement under which the plaintiff became a passenger excluded everything for which the company would have been otherwise liable: they would have been liable for nothing but negligence and he considered that of necessity any such liability was excluded. Blackburn, Mellor and Quain, JJ. agreed. In Reynolds v. Boston Deep Sea Fishing Company 26, a claim was made by the owner of a steam trawler against ship repairers for damage sustained by the trawler while in the defendant's slip which, it was contended, was caused by negligence. By the contract between the parties it was provided in part that: \"all persons using the slip must do so at their own risk and no liability whatever shall attach to the company for any accident or damage done to or by any vessel, either in taking it to the slip or when on it or when launching from it.\" For the plaintiff it was contended that a clause so worded did not protect the defendant against the consequences of its own negligence and Price v. Union Lighterage Company, above referred to, was cited in support of this proposition. Greer, J. considered that under the circumstances there was a presumption of negligence which the defendant had not rebutted but that, since the real obligation of the defendants as the operators of the slip was only to use reasonable care in the circumstances, it must be held that liability for negligence was excluded. Orchard v. Connaught Club Ltd. 27 and Calico Printers' Association v. Barclay's Bank 28 were decided upon similar grounds. In Beaumont-Thomas v. Blue Star Line Ltd. 29, where a passenger who had been injured by falling upon the deck of a vessel claimed damages for negligence and where by the terms of the ticket sold the passengers took upon themselves \"all risks whatsoever of the passage,\" Scott, L.J. in allowing an appeal from a judgment of Lord Hewart, L.C.J. at the trial said in part:\u2014\nIn order to construe any exception of liability for events happening in the performance of the contract, where the words of the exception are not so clear as to leave no doubt as to their meaning, it is essential first to ascertain what the contractual duty would be if there were no exception. In the contract of a common carrier by land, or of a shipowner for the carriage of goods by sea, broadly speaking, the carrier is an insurer of the safe delivery of the goods. If they are damaged on the way, he is liable. That is his primary duty. There is also a secondary duty, however\u2014namely, the duty to use skill and care. That duty comes into play in case of the carrier invoking some term of an exception clause as a protection against liability. In such a case, if the excepted peril has been occasioned by the negligence of the carrier's servants, the failure to perform the secondary duty debars him from reliance upon his exception. In the case of a carrier of passengers, no such double liability attaches. He is under a duty to use due skill and care, and no more. The absolute duty of the goods carrier to keep and deliver safely does not apply. This fundamental difference in the basic contract caused the common law courts of England during the last 100 years to make a difference in the interpretation of general works of exception from liability according as the contract to be construed was one imposing the double duty or only the one duty. In each interpretation they had two principles to guide them, (i) the rule of construction contra proferentem, and (ii) their natural reluctance to read into a contract a release from the duty of skill and care, unless quite unambiguous language made that construction unavoidable \u2026\nIn the case of double duty, the courts have treated the exception as prima facie directed to the absolute undertaking of safe delivery, but as not applying to the performance of the duty of skill and care. On the other hand, in a contract where there was no duty except the duty of skill and care, the courts have construed the same words of exception in the opposite sense\u2014namely, as directed to the duty of skill and care\u2014 for the two simple reasons (i) that some meaning must be given, and (ii) that no other meaning than an exception of liability for negligence was left. This principle of interpretation runs through a long line of cases, of which Price & Co. v. Union Lighterage Co. 1904, 1 O. 412; Pyman S.S. Co. v. Hull & Barnsley Ry. Co., 1915 2 K.B. 729, and Rutter v. Palmer, 1922, 2 K.B. 87 are the chief. In the last case, Scrutton, L.J., after referring to the above rule of construction, speaks of a garage proprietor taking charge of cars and selling them on commission after demonstrating their performance to prospective customers, and says, at pp. 92, 93:\n\"What is his liability (the garage proprietor's liability for a servant driving a car) in these circumstances? He is only liable for his own negligence and the negligence of his servants. If an accident happened without his negligence or that of his servants he would not be liable; but if it happened through his or his servants' negligence he would be liable. In these circumstances he introduces this clause into the contract of his customer: \"Customers' cars are driven by your staff at customers' sole risk.\" There are two obvious limitations to be imposed upon the meaning of those words: First \"staff\" must mean \"driving staff\"; secondly, \"driven\" must mean driven for the purposes of the bailment, namely, the purpose of selling the car. The clause does not mean that the garage keeper is to be free from liability if a member of his clerical staff takes the car out for pleasure. So limited, the clause, which is regularly inserted in all contracts by garage keepers to sell cars for customers and to run them for that purpose, can have only one meaning, and that is that the owner of the car must protect himself by insurance against accidents for which without the clause the garage keeper would be liable, that is against accidents due to the negligence of the garage keeper's servants.\" In the same case, Atkin, L.J., at p. 94, states the reasons with which I began in terms of convincing logic, and his reasoning, in my view, applies directly to, and governs, the present case.\nThe distinction between cases such as these and the common carrier cases is clearly stated by Lord Greene, M.R. in Alderslade v. Hendon Laundry Ltd. 30.\nIn my opinion, the principle of law governing the construction of contracts which was applied in these cases is applicable here. Under the provisions of section 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act the Crown might be held liable for damage to property resulting from the negligence of its servants in the discharge of their duties, a liability quite distinct and not in any way dependent on the contractual obligation to maintain the shed during the currency of the lease. As stated by Pollock, the fact that the work was done pursuant to the lessor's obligations under the contract is merely irrelevant. The Crown reserved the right of access to the property by the terms of the lease and would equally be liable for the negligence of its servants in exercising this right in the course of their duties if damage to property resulted. Yet, if the argument for the Crown be accepted, there would be no liability for such damage by virtue of paragraph 7 or for any other damage caused in any other manner by servants of the Crown while acting within the scope of their duties or employment. Under the contract to maintain the shed, which I think is properly to be construed as a covenant to keep the demised premises in a fit state of repair, the Crown might be held liable in damages if, by way of illustration, the foundation of the shed gave way, due to lack of repair, causing the collapse of the building and injuring goods of the plaintiff on the premises, or if, assuming there were a metal roof, this was allowed to be eaten away by rust permitting the entrance of rain and damaging the respondent's property. Whether notice of the lack of repair to be given by the lessee would or would not be a necessary element in establishing the Crown's liability for any such damage appears to me to be a matter of indifference. Such liability would be in contract and not in tort. That the legal liability to repair was imposed by contract rather than by the common law or by the terms of Art. 1675 of the Civil Code, as in the case of the carrier, does not appear to me to differentiate the position of the appellant and I see no logical reason for making any distinction. The liability of the Crown, as in the case of the common carrier was not confined to that for the negligence of its servants: there was here, as with the carrier, a double liability and, in my opinion, the liability in negligence not having been expressly or by necessary implication excluded remains.\nUnder paragraph 17 of the lease the respondent agreed to:\nindemnify and save harmless the lessor from and against all claims and demands, loss, costs, damages, actions, suits or other proceedings by whomsoever made, brought or prosecuted, in any manner based upon, occasioned by or attributable to the execution of these presents, or any action taken or things done or maintained by virtue hereof, or the exercise in any manner of rights arising hereunder.\nThe work being done by the servants of the Crown was done \"by virtue hereof\" in that it was in the discharge of the obligation to maintain the shed. I am unable to see how there could be any liability on the part of the Crown towards third persons for anything done falling within the ambit of this clause, other than for the negli- gence of the Crown's officers or servants within subsection (c) of section 19 of the Exchequer Court Act. This being so, these general words must be construed as obligating the respondent to indemnify the Crown against the claims of the other respondents, all of which are founded upon negligence of that nature. Harsh as it may seem that the respondent should be found liable to indemnify the Crown against the consequences of the negligence of its own servants, I see no escape from the conclusion that the principle above referred to applies here.\nIn the result the appeal of the Crown against the judgment in favour of the respondent, Canada Steamship Lines, should be dismissed with costs and the appeal upon the third party proceedings in the cases of H. J. Heinz Company of Canada, Ltd., Cunningham and Wells Ltd., Raymond Copping, W. H. Taylor, Ltd., and Canada and Dominion Sugar Co. Ltd. allowed with costs.\nCartwright J.:\u2014This appeal raises questions as to the true construction of two paragraphs in a lease dated the 18th day of November 1940, whereby His Majesty the King leased to Canada Steamship Lines Limited certain lands on the west side of St. Gabriel Basin No. 1 of the Lachine Canal in the city of Montreal together with the right to \"occupy, use and enjoy, for the purpose of receiving and storing therein freight and goods loaded onto and\/or unloaded from vessels owned and operated by the Lessee, the whole of St. Gabriel Shed No. 1, so called (hereinafter referred to as \"the said shed\") \u2026 erected on the said land\". The term of the lease was twelve years from the 1st of May 1940 and the rent reserved was $12,866.62 per annum.\nParagraph 8 of the lease provided that the Lessor would, at all times during the currency of the Lease, at his own cost and expense, maintain the said shed.\nA few days before the 5th day of May 1944, the Respondent, Canada Steamship Lines Limited, requested the Appellant to make certain repairs to the doors of the shed in question. On the 5th day of May 1944, while the employees of the Appellant were at work repairing the said doors, for which purpose they were using an oxy-acetylene torch, a fire was caused which totally destroyed the shed and all of its contents, including large quantities of goods owned respectively by Canada Steamship Lines Limited and the other Respondents.\nCanada Steamship Lines Limited and the other Respondents presented Petitions of Right seeking payment from the Appellant for the loss of their goods, on the ground that such loss had been caused by the negligence of the servants of the Appellant while acting within the scope of their employment. The Appellant by his defence denied negligence and pleaded that in any event he was relieved from liability by the terms of paragraph 7 of the lease. In each action other than that instituted by Canada Steamship Lines Limited steps were taken by the Appellant to add Canada Steamship Lines Limited as a third party from which indemnity was claimed, pursuant to paragraph 17 of the lease, as to any amounts which the Appellant might be ordered to pay to the Suppliants in such proceedings.\nThe petitions were tried together before Angers, J. 31 who gave judgment in favour of Canada Steamship Lines Limited and all the other Suppliants against the Appellant and dismissed the Appellant's claims for indemnity. From these judgments His Majesty appealed to this Court.\nThe appeals as against the Respondents, other than Canada Steamship Lines Limited, were all dismissed at the hearing, the Court being unanimously of opinion that the fire was caused by the negligence of the employees of the Appellant while acting in the scope of their employment. There remain for determination the appeal against the judgment awarded to Canada Steamship Lines Limited and the appeals against the dismissal of the claims for indemnity.\nCounsel were in agreement that the matters in question are governed by the law of Quebec.\nThe learned trial Judge was of opinion that the conduct of the employees of the appellant which caused the fire amounted not merely to negligence but to faute lourde. I am in agreement with what I understand to be the opinion of all the other members of the Court that the conduct of such employees, while clearly negligent, did not amount to faute lourde. It therefore becomes unnecessary to consider the question, which was fully argued before us, as to whether, under the law of Quebec, a party can validly provide by contract that he shall not be liable for his own faute lourde or that of his employees.\nThe decision of this Court in Glengoil Steamship Company v. Pilkington 32 makes it clear that there is no rule of law in Quebec that renders invalid a stipulation in a contract that a party shall not be liable for the negligence of his employees.\nThis leaves for determination the question whether, properly construed, clauses 7 and 17 of the lease contemplate damage caused by the negligence of the employees of the Lessor. These clauses read as follows:\u2014\n7. That the Lessee shall not have any claim or demand against the Lessor for detriment, damage or injury of any nature to the said land, the said shed, the said platform and the said canopy, or to any motor or other vehicles, materials, supplies, goods, articles, effects or things at any time brought, placed, made or being upon the said land, the said platform or in the said shed.\n17. That the Lessee shall at all times indemnify and save harmless the Lessor from and against all claims and demands, loss, costs, damages, actions, suits or other proceedings by whomsoever made, brought or prosecuted, in any mariner based upon, occasioned by or attributable to the execution of these Presents, or any action taken or things done or maintained by virtue hereof, or the exercise in any manner of rights arising hereunder.\nWe were referred to the following articles of the Civil Code as laying down the general rules of construction which should be applied:\u2014\n1013. When the meaning of the parties in a contract is doubtful, their common intention must be determined by interpretation rather than by an adherence to the literal meaning of the words of the contract.\n1018. All the clauses of a contract are interpreted the one by the other, giving to each the meaning derived from the entire act.\n1019. In cases of doubt, the contract is interpreted against him who has stipulated and in favour of him who has contracted the obligation.\n1020. However general the terms may be in which a contract is expressed, they extend only to the things concerning which it appears that the parties intended to contract.\nIn my view these rules of interpretation do not differ from the rules of construction which guide the Courts of common law. Counsel for the appellant submitted that the following provision in the lease should also be borne in mind when construing the paragraphs quoted above:\u2014\nAND FURTHER AGREED by and between the said parties hereto that these Presents are made and executed upon and subject to the covenants, provisoes, conditions and reservations hereinafter set forth and contained, and that the same and every of them, representing and expressing the exact intention of the parties, are to be strictly observed, performed and complied with namely:\u2014\nThis clause seems to me to be an added reason for observing the rule stated by Lord Wensleydale in Thellusson v. Rendlesham 33:\nIn construing all written instruments, the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be adhered to, unless that would lead to some absurdity, or to some repugnance, or to some inconsistency with the rest of the instrument, in which case the grammatical or ordinary sense of the words may be modified, so as to avoid that absurdity, repugnance, or inconsistency, but no farther.\nDealing first with paragraph 7 of the lease, it is clear that the claim of the Respondent, Canada Steamship Lines Limited against the Appellant is a claim for damage to goods in the said shed, and giving to the words used their ordinary and grammatical meaning, they are wide enough to bar the lessee's claim. The Respondent argues, however, that the line of cases commencing with Phillips v. Clark 34, and of which Price & Company v. Union Lighterage Company 35, Putter v. Palmer 36, Beaumont-Thomas v. Blue Star Line 37 and Alderslade v. Hendon Laundry Limited 38 are examples, have established a rule that a clause of this nature shall be so construed as not to exempt from liability for damage caused by negligence unless either words are used expressly referring to negligence or the circumstances are such that the only possible liability for damage which could fall upon the party for whose benefit the clause is inserted is one arising from negligence.\nThe Respondent contends that while this rule has been formulated in England it is equally applicable to the construction of contracts governed by the law of Quebec. I do not find it necessary to decide whether this is so. I shall assume, without deciding, that the rule to be found in the line of cases referred to is applicable to the construction of the lease in question.\nA careful consideration of all the cases to which Counsel made reference on this point has led me to the conclusion that the rule for which the Respondent contends is too widely stated. The rule had its origin in Phillips v. Clark cited above. The words of exemption there relied on were \"Not accountable for leakage or breakage\". Cockburn, C.J. points out that the Defendant being a carrier would be responsible for leakage or breakage occurring without any negligence on his part and that the words used were susceptible of the construction that this absolute liability was all that the parties intended to exclude. He continues at page 162:\u2014\nThe contract being susceptible of two constructions, I think we are bound to put that construction upon it which is the more consonant to reason and common sense; and to hold that it was only intended to exempt him from his ordinary common law liability, and not from responsibility for damage resulting from negligence.\nCrowder, J. at page 163 deals with the matter as follows:\nThe construction put upon the contract by my Lord, is evidently the most just and reasonable,\u2014as absolving the defendant from liability for leakage and breakage the result of mere accident, where no blame was imputable to the master, and for which but for the stipulation in question he would still have been liable. It clearly was not intended to relieve him from responsibility for leakage or breakage the result of his negligence and want of care. The construction contended for on the part of the defendant would be giving the contract a sense not necessarily involved in the words as they stand.\nIn my opinion the test to be applied is found in this passage. If there is a potential, and indeed probable, source of liability to which a party is exposed although he be free from any blame, then the meaning of general words of exemption may be restricted to liability arising from such source. I see no good ground for holding, and I find nothing in the numerous authorities cited to us that appears to me to decide, that general words of exemption wide enough in their ordinary sense to cover every sort of liability should be held not to cover liability arising from negligence merely because some other equally blameworthy source of liability can be imagined. In the case at bar the source of possible liability other than negligence to which it is suggested paragraph 7 of the lease would apply is liability for damage to the goods in the shed resulting from a breach by the Appellant of the covenant to maintain the shed. It is said that goods might be damaged, for example by rain, as a result of the lessor failing, after due notice, to repair the roof of the shed and that as this is a ground of liability other than negligence upon which the words of paragraph 7 can operate they should be interpreted not to cover a claim for damage caused by negligence. Such a construction does not appear to me\u2014to use the words of Cockburn C.J.\u2014\"consonant to reason and common sense\". It would bring about the surprising result that a person who had covenanted to do work would escape liability for damage resulting from his failure or refusal to fulfil his covenant at all but would be liable for similar damage resulting from negligence of his employees in doing the work which he had agreed to do. It seems to me that to fail or refuse to perform a contractual obligation is at least as blameworthy as to be guilty of some negligent act or omission in the course of its performance.\nThe construction of paragraph 7 is, I think, aided by a consideration of paragraph 17. Counsel for the Respondent has not been able to suggest any damages for which the Lessor could be held liable to persons other than the lessee except damages caused by the negligence of the Lessor's servants. In my opinion the words of Section 17 are apt to describe the claims in respect of which the Appellant seeks indemnity in these proceedings. I think that such claims are based upon, occasioned by, or attributable to an action taken or thing done by virtue of the lease, that is the action or deed of the Lessor's employees in repairing the doors of the shed pursuant to the obligation so to do cast upon the Lessor by paragraph 8 of the lease.\nUnder the Civil Code, Section 1018, quoted above, as under the common law, the lease must be construed as a whole. I can find no reason in the words of the document, and I can think of none, why the parties should agree that the lessee must indemnify the lessor against claims of third parties arising against the lessor by reason of the negligence of his servants while the lessee should remain free to claim damages from the lessor for the loss of its own goods from the same cause. I think the construction to be gathered from the whole document and which is the more consonant to reason and common sense is that the intention of the parties was that all the risks of liability for damages to goods on the demised premises was to fall upon the Lessee.\nFor the above reasons it is my opinion that the appeals should be disposed of as proposed by my Lord, the Chief Justice. Fauteux J.:\u2014By indenture of lease, His Majesty the King, therein represented by the Minister of Transport, leased to Canada Steamship Lines, the respondent hereinafter referred to as C.S.L., St. Gabriel shed No. 1 on the waterfront, in Montreal, for the purpose of receiving and storing freight and goods loaded into or unloaded from vessels owned and operated by them. The lessee took possession and the occupation was continued at all times material to the present litigation.\nOn May 5, 1944, the employees of the Department of Transport, pursuant to a request of the lessee and in compliance with the lessor's obligation under the lease, were effecting certain minor repairs to the premises, including doors of the shed. Upon removal of the hinges of a door, it was found necessary to enlarge one of the holes in the steel upright to which the hinges were attached. Before proceeding into such a work of short duration with an oxy-acetylene cutting torch, certain precautions against the danger of fire relating to such operation were taken. To contain and deflect towards the floor any sparks coming from the torch, a wooden plank was wired against the flanges of the steel H beam, inside the shed in a position extending from the roof to within three feet of the cement floor, and an employee with a pail of water was stationed inside to watch for sparks. In the result, a spark fell on some bales of cotton waste and almost immediately the shed was aflame, with the result that it, and its contents, were nearly completely destroyed.\nThe petition of right of C.S.L., lessee of the premises, as well as petitions of five other suppliants\u2014also respondents herein,\u2014having stored property therein, were presented, all claiming damages and alleging fault and negligence of the employees and servants of the lessor while acting in the performance of the work for which they were employed.\nIn all the cases, the appellant entered a plea denying negligence. Further and with respect to the petition of right of C.S.L., the appellant pleaded that any rights the former might have were barred by clause 7 of the lease, which excludes claims of the lessee against the lessor for damages. With respect to the petitions of right of the five other suppliants, the appellant filed third party notices directed to C.S.L. claiming, on the basis of clause 17 of the lease, a right to be indemnified and saved harmless by the lessee against any liability.\nOn the evidence common to all cases, which were heard together, the trial judge 39 found that the fire was due to \"faute lourde\" of the employees of the Department of Transport. Further deciding as a matter of law that one cannot stipulate against the consequences of such fault, the trial judge, by separate judgments, dismissed the contentions of the appellant based on clauses 7 and 17.\nThe present appeal is against all these judgments. This case is governed by ss. (c) of section 19 of the Exchequer Court Act R.S.C. 1927 ch. 34 as amended, worded as follows:\nThe Exchequer Court shall have the exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\u2014\n(a) \u2026\n(b) \u2026\n(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or property resulting from negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nThe above statutory provision imposes a liability on the Crown in respect of claims arising ex delicto and such liability is to be determined by the laws of the province where the cause of action arose. The Queen v. Filion 40; The Queen v. Grenier 41; The King v. Armstrong 42; The King v. Desrosiers 43.\nThe evidence adduced clearly establishes that the fact alleged in support of these claims for tort is, as required by the law of the province of Quebec to be successful, illicit, imputable to the appellant, and tortious. Negligence, even if not to the extent found by the trial judge, is proven. The measure of damages suffered in each case is covered by admissions of the appellant. And it is conceded that the damage was caused by servants of the Crown while acting within the scope of their duties and employment.\nWere there nothing else to be considered in the litigation, the cases of all the suppliants would then be successfully established against the appellant on the basis of the above principles of law and findings of fact. And this is the result so far as the cases of the five suppliants are concerned, for their claim rests exclusively on the above legal principles. It was consequently indicated, at the hearing of the argument, that the judgments of the trial judge with respect to them would be maintained.\nWith respect to the appellant and the respondent, C.S.L., there is to be considered, in addition to the principles of law of general application, the agreement between them,\u2014more especially clauses 7 and 17,\u2014which, within limits of validity and applicability in the matter, constitutes the law of the parties.\nAs to the validity of a stipulation excluding liability for negligence of one's own employees, there cannot be any doubt. The Glengoil Steamship Company v. Pilkington 44; Vipond v. Furness, Withy and Company 45; Canadian National Railway Company v. La Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al 46; Canadian Northern Quebec Railway Company v. Argenteuil Lumber Company 47. There is no need here to go further and deal with the validity of such clause with respect to a fault amounting to \"faute lourde\". On this I say nothing.\nBut the real point to be considered is the applicability of clauses 7 and 17 in order to decide whether the provisions of the former constitute here a bar to the claim of C.S.L. against the appellant and whether those of the latter clause oblige C.S.L. to indemnify and save harmless the appellant with respect to the judgments obtained by the five other suppliants.\nIt is convenient here to reproduce the text of clause 7:\u2014\n7. That the Lessee shall not have any claim or demand against the Lessor for detriment, damage or injury of any nature to the said land, the said shed, the said platform and the said canopy, or to any motor or other vehicles, materials, supplies, goods, articles, effects or things at any time brought, placed, made or being upon the said land, the said platform or in the said shed.\nThe language of clause 7 is adequate to bar effectively \"any claim or demand\" of the lessee against the lessor for any \"detriment, damage or injury\",\u2014to things therein enumerated,\u2014resulting from the breach of one or several obligations created by the sole will of the parties under the contract. And it is not difficult to conceive cases where such breaches would bring the clause into full operation. Thus, damage is done by rain to goods placed in the shed, consequential upon the failure of the lessor to repair the roof of the same. Without this clause of non-responsibility, the lessee, owner of the goods damaged, would have a right of action against the lessor. Equally, if the goods damaged belong to a third party, the lessee would have a right of action in warranty against the lessor, if this third party should sue him for damages. But resting exclusively on the contractual obligation of the lessor to repair, these rights of action of the lessee against the lessor are, in the present instance, nullified equally by another contractual provision as to non-responsibility.\nThe contract, however, is not the only source of obligation. For such \"detriment, damage or injury\" may equally result from the breach of the legal duty, imposed upon all, not to cause damage to others. Such legal duty pre-exists and persists quite independently of the contract. The right of action resulting from its breach is prima facie maintained. It is the law. If a party to a contract wants to make an exception to a legal principle of general application and be relieved of the obligation to compensate for damage arising out of his employees' negligence, he must so stipulate in the contract. The maxim \"Reus in exipiendo fit actor\" applies. The burden is on him to show that the exception was made and is applicable to the case under consideration. And the stipulation will be strictly interpreted. (Mazeaud, Trait\u00e9 de la responsabilit\u00e9 civile, d\u00e9lictuelle et contractuelle, tome 3, page 724, no 2578). In brief, the intention of the parties must be manifested. The law exacts no more. Such intention may at times be implied in a relevant contractual obligation. Thus if the covenant is to make repairs in the most prudent manner, the legal duty is absorbed in the contractual obligation. Savatier (Trait\u00e9 de la responsabilit\u00e9 civile en droit fran\u00e7ais, tome 1, no 153):\n\u2026 il n'en est pas moins vrai que le contrat peut \u00eatre construit de telle mani\u00e8re qu'il ne laisse pas concevoir, dans certains compartiments, l'usage d'une responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9lictuelle, parce qu'il l'absorberait dans la responsabilit\u00e9 contractuelle. The clause of non-responsibility for damages would then embrace damages ex contractu and ex delicto as well.\nThe covenant to repair, agreed by the parties herein is worded as follows:\n8. That the Lessor will, at all times during the currency of this Lease, at his own cost and expense, maintain the said shed, exclusive of the said platform and the said canopy.\nThe appellant's contention is that the legal duty not to do damage to others is absorbed in this clause, and he then concludes that the responsibility flowing from the breach of this all embracing covenant is thus excluded by clause 7. He rests his contention on the following test given by Savatier, a leading writer on the matter (Trait\u00e9 de la responsabilit\u00e9 civile en droit fran\u00e7ais, tome 1, no 153):\n\u2026 le simple devoir de ne pas nuire \u00e0 autrui, bien qu'il puisse, en l'absence de tout contrat, fonder une responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9lictuelle, est recouvert et absorb\u00e9 par le contrat, toutes les fois que la cause du dommage r\u00e9side exclusivement dans l'inex\u00e9cution d'un engagement contractuel.\nI am unable, I must say, to accede to the views of the appellant, that in this case the \"cause of damage is to be found exclusively in the inexecution of the obligation\" to repair. On the contrary, the damage was caused by an act of negligence arising while the contractual obligation to repair was being,\u2014and in point of fact was nearly completely,\u2014executed. An opposite view I would have, had damage in this case been done to goods by rain as a result of the default of the lessor to repair the roof of the shed.\nCan this intention to exclude responsibility for damage ex delicto be found in the very clause of non-responsibility, clause 7? This clause is clearly comprehensive with respect to the varieties of damages, \"detriment, damage or injury\", and definite as to things covered by it. And for this reason, one could reasonably gather from its wording that the minds of the parties were directed much more to the result of a breach of obligation than to the nature of the breached obligation itself. In the latter respect, there is nothing said except what could be inferred from the opening words \"any claim or demand\". These words are strictly general. Had the parties intended to cover only damages ex contractu or only damages ex delicto or both kinds of damages, the expressions used \"any claim or demand\" would in each of these three alternatives have been apt to convey any one of such different intentions. The same words are equally capable of referring to the procedural nature of the recourse: principal action or action in warranty. Isolated from the contract, I could not, for the reasons above indicated, obtain from the reading of this clause, the satisfaction that the appellant has discharged the burden of showing that the parties definitely considered, in addition to the contractual obligation the legal duty existing beyond their contract and that they thus intended to exclude \"claims or demands\" arising out of the breach of such legal duty by the lessor's employees.\nThe meaning of the parties in clause 7 being open to question, their common intention must be ascertained by interpretation rather than by adhering to the literal meaning of the words of the clause. To that end, the following rule of the Civil Code may be resorted to.\n1018. All clauses of the contract are interpreted the one by the other giving to each the meaning derived from the entire act.\nIt is particularly relevant to consider at first the allied provision: clause 17 of the contract:\u2014\n17. That the Lessee shall at all times indemnify and save harmless the Lessor from and against all claims and demands, loss, costs, damages, actions, suits or other proceedings by whomsoever made, brought or prosecuted, in any manner based upon, occasioned by or attributable to the execution of these Presents, or any action taken or things done or maintained by virtue hereof, or the exercise in any manner of rights arising hereunder.\nThis clause refers to claims and demands of third parties against the lessor for damages. There being no contractual relations between the former and the latter, such claims and demands for damages must, of necessity, be for damages ex delicto. Thus clause 17 affords manifest evidence that the minds of the parties were directed to other obligations than those flowing simply from the contract, that the legal duty not to do damage to others was considered and dealt with and this precisely in terms all embracing and thus consistent with the generality of the terms of clause 7 as they can be and are, in fact, interpreted by the appellant. The general intention and the will of the lessor to be effectively relieved of all responsibility in this respect as well as with respect to contractual obligations, cannot be better manifested, implemented in a greater measure and in a more efficient manner than they are by the terms of clause 17.\nThe governing provision of the lease as to interpretation reads:\nAND FURTHER AGREED by and between the said parties hereto that these Presents are made and executed upon and subject to the covenants, provisoes, conditions and reservations hereinafter set forth and contained, and that the same and every of them, representing and expressing the exact intention of the parties, are to be strictly observed, performed and complied with namely:\nThus to obtain the lease, the lessee agreed, by clause 7, to waive all rights to any claim or demand for damages against the lessor. Moreover, and by clause 17, the lessee went further by assuming obligations which it did not have under the law and thus accepted such unpredictable and immeasurable risks.\nIn my view, clause 17 is not only adequate to maintain the third party notices directed to C.S.L. by the appellant, but, read with the above covenants, quite indicative that the parties really meant all that they said by the generality of the opening words of section 7 \"any claims or demands\". On the whole, I am satisfied that the lease was granted on the condition that all the risks relating to breaches of obligation, contractual and legal, were to be borne exclusively by the lessee.\nFor all these reasons, I concur in the conclusions reached by my Lord the Chief Justice as to the disposal of these appeals.\nAppeals against C.S.L. allowed with costs.\nAppeals against the other respondents dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.

Patterson Sr. (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nAlfred Gordon Burton, As Liquidator of Home Assurance Company of Canada (Plaintiff) Respondent\n1950: May 2, 3; 1950: June 23.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand and Estey JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION\nCompanies\u2014Wound up under Dominion Winding Up Act\u2014Contribution of shareholders\u2014Whether liable to calls when shares issued in violation of Alberta Sale of Shares Act\u2014Subsequent conduct as shareholders\u2014The Alberta Sale of Shares Act, R.S.A. 1922, c. 169\u2014The Winding Up Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 213.\nThe Home Assurance Company of Canada having been wound up under the Dominion Winding Up Act on the ground of insolvency, the liquidator applied to have the appellants listed as contributories as being liable to call for the amount remaining unpaid on their shares. The appellants pleaded that they were not liable since the shares had been issued in violation of the provisions of the Alberta Sale of Shares Act. The call was allowed by the trial judge and was confirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta.\nHeld: Following the principle laid down in McAskill v. North Western Trust Co. ([1926] S.C.R. 412), the appellants, even though the original contracts of sale of the shares were void due to the non-compliance with the Alberta Sale of Shares Act, must be held to be contributories as their subsequent conduct as shareholders has resulted in \"independent binding agreements\".\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division 1, confirming the decision of Macdonald J. fixing the list of the contributories in the winding up of the Home Assurance Company of Canada.\nH. S. Patterson K.C. and Malcolm Millard K.C. for the appellants.\nW. A. McGillivray for the respondent. The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014The Home Assurance Company was incorporated by private Act of the Legislature of the Province of Alberta in 1918, with an authorized capital of $500,000, divided into 5,000 shares, having a par value of $100 each. By the terms of its Charter, the company was empowered to make contracts for fire, storm, hail, accident, automobile, plateglass, burglary, theft, etc.\nOn the 2nd day of November, 1948, after nearly thirty years of operations, the company was ordered to be wound up under the Dominion Winding Up Act, by order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Hugh J. MacDonald, on the ground of insolvency, and the plaintiff-respondent Alfred Gordon Burton was appointed permanent liquidator. On the 8th of March, 1949, the latter filed a statement of claim praying that the shareholders of the company, who had paid originally only a small instalment plus the premium, on the purchase price of their shares, be listed as contribu-tories, as being liable to call to the extent of $85 for each share held by such contributory. The claim was allowed by Mr. Justice MacDonald, and his judgment was unanimously confirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta 2.\nThe relevant facts which give rise to the present litigation may be summarized as follows:\nIn 1922, four years after its incorporation, the company, pursuant to the provisions of The Sale of Shares Act (R.S.A. 1922, c. 169), applied to the Board of Public Utilities of the province, for leave to sell shares to the public, and on January 19, 1923, was authorized to sell 500 shares. Further permissions were also granted on June 29, 1923, and on February 14, 1924, for 1,000 shares each time, making a grand total of 2,500 shares. The Board also fixed the premium on these shares at $10, and prescribed a form of contract covering their sale.\nThe defendants-appellants' submissions are manifold in view of the fact that although all the alleged shareholders are representd by Mr. H. S. Patterson, they have separate grounds of defence. Some claim that they cannot be compelled to pay the balance of 85 owing on each share, because the shares in question were issued contrary to the provisions of The Sale of Shares Act, in that shares to the number of 5,000 were issued by the company when the number authorized by the Board was only 2,500. It is also contended by others that sales were made by non-registered agents, that in other cases licensed agents failed to produce to the purchasers their licences or did not deliver copies of contracts, that numerous sales were made at premiums other than those allowed by the Board, and, at times when the company did not have any certificate from the Board, and finally, that fraudulent representations were made to several prospective investors.\nIt was found quite impossible to deal with each case individually, and therefore, counsel for both parties have signed the following agreement:\n1. That so far as the existence of Certificates of the Board, the existence of Agents' Licenses and the forms of the Applications for Shares are concerned, and as to whether sales were made in excess of the Certificates issued or by unlicensed salesmen or at premiums other than those permitted by the said Certificates, we are satisfied that all the evidence available is before the Court and the matter should be disposed of on that basis. We may say that should either side discover additional evidence not available at the time of the trial of the issues, the other will not oppose an application to present it in the interests of having before the Court the true facts.\n2. That so far as the defences that copies of contracts were not delivered and that agents did not exhibit their licences to the prospective purchasers at the time of sale, and the question of fraud, the individual contributories may bring additional evidence applicable to particular cases if these defences are found to be valid.\nIn their statement of defence, the defendants allege that the contracts of sale of these shares are void, and created no liability on their part. The defence of absolute nullity however does not cover the cases where false representations may be proven.\nIn support of this proposition, the defendants rely on the case of McAskill v. North Western Trust Co. 3, where it was held that if a company to which The Manitoba Sale of Shares Act applies, sells its shares without having complied with the provisions of the Act, the sale and all steps taken to carry it out, such as an allotment of shares, are void and not merely voidable.\nIn the case at bar, it is not contested that serious breaches of the Alberta Sale of Shares Act occurred, as for instance the sale of a larger number of shares than the number authorized, sales at a premium higher than $10, and it is not disputed that many agents were not registered, that some others did not produce their licences to purchasers and did not deliver them copies of the contracts as required by the Act.\nI have no hesitation in deciding that all these violations of the law bring these sales within the sweep of the McAskill case, and make them not merely voidable but void. Where the transaction is a nullity, as it is here, the alleged shareholder need not ask for the recision of the contract, as the case would be between him and the company, if fraud or misrepresentation were established. Here, as Sir Lyman Duff said in the McAskill case: \"The agreement though concluded in fact, is in point of law, a nullity.\" The case therefore cannot be governed by such decisions as Oakes v. Turquand 4, where the contract was merely voidable. In such a case, when there has been misrepresentation, a distinction must be drawn between the rights of the shareholders towards the company and his rights towards the liquidator. As Sir Lyman Duff said in the McAskill case, at page 419:\u2014\nThe case would, of course, be very different if the appellant were the holder of shares allotted to him pursuant to a contract capable of being rescinded on some proper legal ground, such as fraud, but valid and binding until so rescinded. Such a right may be lost by reason of some change in the circumstances making it unjust to permit the exercise of that right, and accordingly it has been held, and has long been settled law, that a registered shareholder, having a right to rescind his contract to take shares on the ground of misrepresentations contained in the company's prospectus, will lose that right if he fails to exercise it before the commencement of winding-up proceedings. The basis of this is that the winding-up order creates an entirely new situation, by altering the relations, not only between the creditors and the shareholders, but also among the shareholders inter se.\nBut the authority of the McAskill case has also been relied upon by the liquidator. All these contributories whom the liquidator seeks to put on the list, have accepted and kept their certificates, paid the first instalment on each share and a further call in 1945, and from 1932 to 1947 inclusive, have received and cashed 16 dividends amounting to approximately $14 per share. There can be little doubt that they have acted as shareholders, and it is also fair to assume that the vast majority of them have sent proxies or have attended personally annual and special meetings of the company. It is contended that in view of these circumstances they have by their conduct, acquired the status of shareholders with all the liabilities imposed upon them by the law.\nAlthough it was held in the McAskill case that all sales made in violation of The Sale of Shares Act were void, there are in the reasons given some qualifications that mitigate the rigour of the main principle that was laid down. The Court held that the sale was void and that the alleged shareholder could not be listed as a contributory, but it clearly envisaged the possibility that under different circumstances, even in a case of absolute nullity, an entirely different result might obtain.\nSpeaking for himself and for Mr. Justice Newcombe, Sir Lyman Duff said at page 420:\u2014\nThere are no facts in the stated case to support a conclusion that there was a valid contract by conduct between the Company and the appellant not falling within the prohibiton of \"The Sale of Shares Act.\"\nAnd further at page 422, discussing the judgment of Lord MacNaghten in Welton v. Saffery 5, he added:\u2014\nI am quite unable to entertain a doubt, however, that the shares had been dealt with, or that the shareholders had acted with respect to the shares in such a way as to create an agreement by conduct to accept them, an agreement not affected by the condition that the shares should be treated as fully paid up.\nMr. Justice Mignault, with whom Chief Justice Anglin concurred, is not less emphatic. He says at page 431:\u2014\nThe application for shares by the appellant and the allotment of these shares to him are consequently void, and there is no contract between him and the Company. No dealings of the appellant with the stock are alleged, and there is nothing from which an independent agreement to keep the stock and pay for it can be implied.\nIn Re Railway Time Tables Publishing Company; Ex Parte Sandys 6, an independent contract to keep the shares and pay for them was implied, although it was held that the original contract to purchase shares at a discount was void. But the purchaser had dealt with the stock, had sold or attempted to sell a part of it, and had signed proxies as a shareholder for voting purposes, and it was therefore held that this implied independent contract was binding. In Acme Products Limited 7, the Court of Appeal for Manitoba decided:\u2014\nAn applicant for shares in a company who accepted the shares allotted him, paid for them in part, allowed his name to appear on the list of shareholders, attended both in person and by proxy shareholders' meetings and accepted a dividend held to be precluded from contending for the first time after a winding-up order had been made that the directors who made the allotment were only de facto not de jure directors, and from disputing his status as a shareholder.\nAt page 587, in the same case, Mr. Justice Dennistoun speaking for the Court said:\u2014\nIn my opinion his conduct has the effect of precluding him from disputing his status as a shareholder, and he cannot at this stage overcome the onus which is upon him by simply stating, \"I did not know until after the winding-up order was made that the directors in 1928 were not properly qualified.\"\nI have reached the conclusion that although the original contracts were void in view of the McAskill case which is a binding authority, the shareholders, appellants in the present case, must be held to be contributories. By their acts, posterior to the impugned agreements, they have agreed to become shareholders, and from their conduct independent binding agreements have resulted. They have agreed to keep the stock, they now must pay for it. It would indeed be strange that persons, who during over fifteen years have claimed all the benefits of these shares, could now be allowed to repudiate one of the liabilities imposed by law upon the shareholders, which is to pay the purchase price.\nI agree with the conclusions reached by the courts below, and I would therefore dismiss the appeal, with costs of the appellants and respondent to be paid by the liquidator, out of the assets of the company, reserving however to each party the right to bring additional evidence applicable to particular cases, in accordance with their agreement.\nRand J.:\u2014In this appeal, the question of the effect of the issue of shares in violation of the provisions of the Sale of Shares Act, c. 169, R.S.A., 1922 on the liability of contributories is raised.\nOver five thousand shares in all were issued, of which more than half were sold to persons in Alberta, over two thousand to persons in British Columbia and a small number in Manitoba and in Saskatchewan; and the sales were all made between 1922 and 1928. It may be taken that those sold outside of Alberta were not authorized by certificates issued under the Act. Between 1932 and 1947 the company paid 16 dividends totalling $14 a share, and in 1945 made a call for $2.50 a share. All but 100 or so of the shares had, in the course of the years, been transferred. On November 2, 1948 an order was made to wind the company up under the Winding-Up Act. The company was heavily involved, and the liquidator applied for leave to call up the amount remaining unpaid of $85 on each share issued. The courts below have held against the defences raised, and I think they were right.\nMr. Patterson puts his case on the principle laid down by this Court in McAskill v. The Northwestern Trust Company 8, that the prohibition of sale by such a statute renders the de facto transaction void in law. In that case, the shareholder had remained on the registry for something less than 1 \u00bd years, but had taken no step of any kind as a shareholder. The purported sale being a nullity, and nothing having occurred to change that state of things, an order removing his name was directed.\nThe difficulty arises from the fact that legislation of this sort looks only to the relation between the prospective shareholder and the company, and if they were the only parties at any time concerned, it would be easily resolved. But as it is well exemplified here, other interests arise; the legislation has condemned only the transaction carried out in the specified circumstances and the question is whether a new and unprohibited transaction or situation has arisen, to be evaluated in the light of those considerations in the setting of which the statute has, in fact, been enacted.\nAlthough the immediate transaction is voided, the beneficiaries of that protection have in fact enabled the company in this case to commence business and to involve itself in heavy obligations to members of the public; what, then, is the true ground upon which they can be said to have precluded themselves from insisting on the original nullity?\nDisregarding the question whether a certificate authorizing the sale of shares in Alberta applies to sale to residents of British Columbia by allotment in Alberta, and whether the failure to furnish a copy of the contract, the effect of which is that the contract \"shall not be binding upon\" the purchaser, is to be taken to be voidable rather than void, it is clear that by accepting dividends, by paying a call and by transferring shares, the holder at such time acknowledged himself to be a shareholder. It may be that he was acting in ignorance of the matters giving rise to the nullity; but although such statutes are enacted for his protection, they assume that he will be reasonably vigilant in his own concern; and if he either fails to do that or by an act irrevocably affirms his membership in the company, then the protection disappears. There is nothing to prevent the individual by an overt act from agreeing, in effect, absolutely, at any time, that his name is properly on the register and thereafter he will be bound to the consequences flowing from that fact. By purporting to transfer shares in a lawful manner, he makes such an irrevocable election; by accepting dividends and paying calls after the expiration of any reasonable time for enquiry into the circumstances of the company or of the sale to him of the shares, he makes the same election; and other situations are possible in which the lapse of time and the rise of new interests will supersede the purpose of the statute.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nEstey J.:\u2014The shareholders of the Home Insurance Company of Canada in liquidation contend that their names ought not to be included in the list of contributories on the basis that the shares were originally sold by the company in contravention of the Sale of Shares Act (1922 R.S.A., c. 16 enacted 1916 St. Alta. c. 8). The company was incorporated by private Act of the Legislature of Alberta in 1918 (St. of Alta., 1918, c. 58). The shares were sold in the years 1922 to 1928, inclusive.\nThe shareholders do not deny either the purchase of their respective shares, the allotment and their acceptance thereof, the presence of their names on the share register or that they received sixteen dividends between the years 1932 and 1947 and paid a call in 1945. They assert that the contract is void because of noncompliance with the Sale of Shares Act, in that the certificates issued by the Public Utility Commissioners did not cover all of the shares sold; all of the shares were not sold by licenced agents; the agents did not produce their licences at the time of the sale; the contracts of the purchase did not specify the unpaid balance and no copy of the contract was delivered to the shareholders at the time of the purchase.\nThe evidence upon which the shareholders ask that it be found that the Sale of Shares Act was not complied with in respect of the granting of the certificates and agents' licences may be summarized as follows: A search of the company's records discloses that the share records, original minutes, financial statements, cancelled share certificates and stubs of certificates are all the records now available. The company has no record of any correspondence with the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, of the certificates or agents' licences issued by that Board.\nThe file produced from the office of the Board of Public Utility Commissioners discloses that on December 11, 1922, the company filed a statement showing that the directors had purchased 500 shares of the capital stock and asking permission to offer for sale to the public a further 500 shares. This permission was granted January 19, 1923. In June, 1923, the company was permitted to offer a further 1,000 shares and in February, 1924, a similar permission in respect of a further 1,000. shares. The records, therefore, disclose that the company was permitted to sell to the, public 2,500 shares and that its own directors had purchased 500 shares, a total of 3,000 of the 5,039 shares sold. The file also discloses that in 1923 and 1924 seven agents were authorized to sell the shares of this company by the Public Utility Commissioners.\nIt is significant that this company began selling shares to the public in 1922 and that the foregoing file covers the latter part of 1922 and the years 1923 and 1924. The last certificate issued for the sale of shares in February, 1924, would not expire until February, 1925. Shares continued to be sold in the years 1925 and 1926, but only 35 in 1927 and 1928. It will, therefore, appear that well over one-half of the total of 5,039 shares purchased were sold either to the directors or the public after the required certificates were obtained from the Public Utility Commissioners granting permission to this company to sell its shares. It is not at all suggested that the file produced from the records of the Public Utility Commissioners contains all of the correspondence between that body and the company nor certificates and agents' licences issued. It was produced by the assistant auditor of the Board who had no personal knowledge of this matter, as he had been with the Board only since June 1, 1946. No person purported to say that the file contained a complete record of all that had passed between the Board and the company. This file, admitted in evidence without objection, warrants the conclusion that the company in 1922, 1923 and 1924, at least so far as the obtaining of certificates and agents licences was concerned, were complying with the provisions of the Sale of Shares Act. As regards the years 1925, 1926, 1927 and 1928, this evidence goes no further than saying that the records are not now available. In view of the foregoing, it cannot be doubted that there were records at one time in the possession of the company, but it is not in any way suggested that there has been any improper conduct associated with the fact that they are not now available. In the result, there is no evidence that the Sale of Shares Act was not complied with in the obtaining of the necessary certificates granting permission to sell shares to the public or agents' licences. The appellants have not, therefore, upon these bases established that the contracts under which the shares were purchased were void transactions.\nAs stated by Baron Parke in Shaw v. Beck 9, \"\u2026 every transaction in the first instance is assumed to be valid and the proof of fraud lies upon the person by whom it is imputed.\" This case is distinguishable from those where a contract upon its face disclosed that the purchaser had not become a shareholder as in Standard Fire Insurance Co.10.\nThen, as to the other defences, the position is somewhat different. While the shareholders may well maintain that they did not know until after the winding-up proceedings what the company did as regards obtaining of certificates and agents' licences, they did know from the outset that at the time of the sale the agents did not produce their licences; that they did not receive a copy of the contract under which they purchased the shares, and, as far as they were concerned, it did not specify the unpaid balance, all of which was required by the Sale of Shares Act.\nThese shareholders, with knowledge of the foregoing facts, as well as the fact that the shares had been allotted, the share certificates received by them and their names on the share register, conducted themselves as shareholders and were accepted as such by the company. Some of them transferred their shares. They or their successors accepted some sixteen dividends over a period of fifteen years from 1932 to 1947, and paid a call in 1945. At least some of these shareholders, it must be assumed, attended and took part in the shareholders' meetings. It is on the basis of this conduct that the liquidator, at the hearing of this appeal, submitted that, notwithstanding that the original contract was void, the shareholders in the company had so conducted themselves that a new contract, independent of any illegality, should be implied covering the purchase of the shares.\nThe non-disclosure by agent of their licences and failure to give to the purchaser of shares a copy of his contract constitute breaches of the Sale of Shares Act that would make these contracts void and in law a nullity. McAskill v. The Northwestern Trust Co.11. Moreover, conduct pursuant to such a transaction cannot accomplish anything in law and is likewise a nullity. This was the position in re London and Northern Ins. Corp.12, where it was stated:\u2014\n\u2026 all those acts were, however, done in conformity with, and in pursuance of, this void transaction; and there was no evidence of any separate agreement on the part of Colonel Stace and Mr. Worth.\nIn Bank of Hindustan v. Alison 13, the company failed in its action to enforce a call. Kelly C.B., with whom all of the learned judges concurred, stated, at p. 225:\nBut, when we come to look at what the transaction really was between the parties as to the granting and acceptance of these shares, it is clear beyond a doubt that all that was done was done in pursuance and upon the faith of the agreement of amalgamation, and, therefore, when it turned out that that agreement was void, it follows that all that was done under it became void also, and conferred no right or obligation on either party. If the defendant had received certificates for shares, or even if he had received dividends, he would have been bound to return them.\nThough not a proceeding to enforce a call in liquidation proceedings, the foregoing is relevant as when the transaction is void it can neither be enforced by the company nor liquidator. Buckley on The Companies Act, 12th Ed. p. 281.\nThese cases, however, contemplate the possibility of a valid contract subsequent to a void transaction, when the parties in possession of the facts conduct themselves as and are accepted by the company as shareholders. Welton v. Saffrey 14, is an illustration of such a contract. There, notwithstanding the original contract for the purchase of the shares was void, the Court found a valid contract independent of the illegality existed. The shareholder with knowledge of his position and in spite of opportunities to alter his position for one and a half years prior to the winding up, the company continued to accept him and he to conduct himself as if he was a shareholder. The precise conduct is not disclosed in any of the reports of this case. Duff J. (later Chief Justice) after commenting upon this fact, continued as follows:\nI am quite unable to entertain a doubt, however, that the shares had been dealt with, or that the shareholders had acted with respect to the shares in such a way as to create an agreement by conduct to accept them, an agreement not affected by the condition that the shares should be treated as fully paid up.\" McAskill v. The Northwestern Trust Company supra, at p. 422.\nIn re Railway Time Tables Publishing Company 15, there were no winding-up proceedings, but a shareholder asked the register be rectified by the removal of her name therefrom. There the original purchase was void, but her subsequent conduction with knowledge of her position justified the conclusion that a new contract existed between the company and herself. See also In Re Barangah Oil Refining Company 16; Re Atlas Loan Co. -ex parte Con-tributories 17; Re Pakenham Pork Packing Co.18. The appellant shareholders, because of the enumerated breaches of the Sale of Shares Act, upon which their other defences were supported, might have succeeded if only the original contract should be considered. These shareholders, however, with knowledge of the facts upon which they now contend their contracts were void, have conducted themselves as shareholders. Either the original shareholders, or their successors, have assumed the obligations and accepted the benefits. They do not suggest they did not know of the Sale of Shares Act or its provisions. Even if they had, their lack of knowledge of this statute, enacted for their benefit prior to and in force in the province of Alberta throughout the twenty-six years this company existed, would not be of assistance in their present contention. In this regard their positions are quite distinguishable from the position of the shareholders in the above mentioned case where both parties proceeded for a time under a misapprehension, as disclosed by a subsequent determination, of what might well be included under the heading of doubtful points of law.\nThe circumstances are such that a new contract, independent of the original void transaction, exists, based upon the conduct of these shareholders and the company. It follows that the shareholders have been properly included in the list of contributories.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs of the parties hereto payable out of the assets of the company.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Patterson, Hobbs and Patterson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fenerty, Fenerty, Mc-Gillivray and Robertson.\n1 30 C.B.R. 142.\n2 30 C.B.R. 142.\n3 [1926] S.C.R. 412.\n4 (1867) L.R. 2 H.L. 325.\n5 [1897] A.C. 200.\n6 42 Ch.

Therefore a call can be made on the contributories by the liquidator for the full balance still owing on each share.\nJudgment appealed from (30 C.B.R. 234) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division 1, reversing the decision of Macdonald J. authorizing the liquidator to make a call on the contributories of the Home Assurance Company of Canada for 100 per cent of the amount owed on each share.\nW. A. McGillivray for the appellant.\nH. S. Patterson K.C. and Malcolm Millard K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting):\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Taschereau, for the reasons he has given, and I would dismiss the appeal with costs to be paid to both parties out of the assets of the company. Kerwin J.:\u2014Home Assurance Company of Canada is being wound up under the provisions of the Dominion Winding-up Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 213. The liquidator moved for an order making a call on each of the shareholders of the company for one hundred per cent of the amount for which they are, or may be, respectively settled upon the list of contributors as being the amount unpaid on their shares. By its special Act, the company was subject to the Insurance Act of Alberta, c. 58 of the 1918 Statutes, s. 119(9) of which is as follows:\u2014\n119(9). The shares of the capital stock subscribed for shall be paid by such instalments and at such times and places as the directors appoint; the first instalment shall not exceed twenty-five per cent and no subsequent instalment shall exceed ten per cent and not less than thirty days' notice of any call shall be given, and no call shall be made at a less interval than thirty days from the last preceding call.\nSections 31, 53, 55 and 59 of the Winding-up Act provide:\u2014\n31. Upon the appointment of the liquidator all the powers of the directors shall cease, except in so far as the court or the liquidator sanctions the continuance of such powers.\n53. Every shareholder or member of the company or his representative, shall be liable to contribute the amount unpaid on his shares of the capital, or on his liability to the company, or to its members or creditors, as the case may be, under the Act, charter or instrument of incorporation of the company, or otherwise.\n2. The amount which he is liable to contribute shall be deemed an asset of the company, and a debt due to the company, payable as directed or appointed under this Act.\n55. The liability of any person to contribute to the assets of a company under this Act, in the event of the business of the same being wound up, shall create a debt accruing due from such person at the time when his liabilities commenced, but payable at the time or respective times when calls are made, as hereinafter mentioned, for enforcing such liability.\n59. The court may, at any time after making a winding-up order, and either before or after it has ascertained the sufficiency of the assets of the company, make calls on and order payment thereof by all or any of the contributories for the time being settled on the list of contributories, to the extent of their liability, for payment of all or any sums it deems necessary to satisfy the debts and liabilities of the company, and the costs, charges and expenses of winding up, and for the adjustment of the rights of the contributories among themselves.\nIn view of these provisions there would be no question that the winding-up order overrides the contract between the company and the shareholder: In re Cordova Union Gold Co.2; London Provident Building Society v. Morgan 3; In Re Pyle Works 4, per Lindley L.J.; Re Wiarton Beet Sugar Co. (Jarvis' case) 5. The respond- ent, however, relies upon subsection 2 of s. 60 of the Winding-up Act, both subsections of which read as follows:\n60. The court may, in making a call, take into consideration the probability that some of the contributories upon whom the same is made may partly or wholly fail to pay their respective portions of the same.\n2. No call shall compel payment of a debt before the maturity thereof, and that the extent of the liability of any contributory shall not be increased by anything in this section contained.\nIt is said that the maturity of the debt is governed by s. 119(9) of the Alberta Insurance Act and that in making calls the liquidator and the Court are bound by its provisions. It was so decided by Walsh J. in Re the Alliance Investment Company (Canada) Limited 6, and by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta in the present case. With respect, I am unable to agree, in view of the cessation of the directors' powers and the intervention of the winding-up order and the provisions of the Winding-up Act previously set out. The maturity of the debt is that set by the Court in making the calls.\nAfter deciding to this effect, the judge of first instance, H. J. Macdonald, J., settled a list of contributories and ordered payment on or before March 15, 1950. The appeal should be allowed, the order of H. J. Macdonald, J. restored except that the time for payment should be extended to September 15, 1950. The costs of all parties throughout may be paid out of the assets of the company.\nTaschereau J. (dissenting):\u2014This case is a counterpart of the case of Patterson es-qual, v. Burton 7, decided this same day, in which I came to the conclusion that the shareholders of the Home Assurance Company were liable to call as contributories to the extent of $85 per share.\nBefore the judgment of the Court of Appeal had been rendered, the liquidator applied to Mr. Justice Hugh J. Macdonald for an order making a call on each of the shareholders, for 100 per cent of the amount for which they were respectively settled upon the list of contributories. This application was allowed by Mr. Justice Macdonald, but the Court of Appeal held, reversing the trial judge, that calls should be for the amounts and at the intervals specified by section 119(9) of The Insurance Act, which reads as follows:\ns.s. (9). The shares of the capital stock subscribed for shall be paid by such instalments and at such times and places as the directors appoint; the first instalment shall not exceed twenty-five per cent and no subsequent instalment shall exceed ten per cent and not less than thirty days' notice of any call shall be given, and no call shall be made at a less interval than thirty days from the last preceding call.\nThis company is being wound-up under the provisions of the Winding-up Act, and the following sections of that statute are particularly relevant:\u2014\n53. Every shareholder or member of the company or his representative, shall be liable to contribute the amount unpaid on his shares of the capital, or on his liability to the company, or to its members or creditors, as the case may be, under the Act, Charter or instrument of incorporation of the company, or otherwise.\n2. The amount which he is liable to contribute shall be deemed an asset of the company, and a debt due to the company, payable as directed or appointed under this Act.\n55. The liability of any person to contribute to the assets of a company under this Act, in the event of the business of the same being wound up, shall create a debt accruing due from such person at the time when his liability commenced, but payable at the times or respective times when calls are made, as hereinafter mentioned, for enforcing such liability.\n59. The court may, at any time after making a winding-up order, and either before or after it has ascertained the sufficiency of the assets of the company, make calls on and order payment thereof by all or any of the contributories for the time being settled on the list of contributories, to the extent of their liability, for payment of all or any sums it deems necessary to satisfy the debts and liabilities of the company, and the costs, charges and expenses of winding-up, and for the adjustment of the rights of the contributories among themselves.\n60. The court may, in making a call, take into consideration the probability that some of the contributories upon whom the same is made, may partly or wholly fail to pay their respective portions of the same.\n2. No call shall compel payment of a debt before the maturity thereof, and that the extent of the liability of any contributory shall not be increased by anything in this section contained.\nPursuant to section 119(9) of The Insurance Act, which I have already cited, the company adopted a by-law relating to the payment of the shares. It reads as follows:\u2014\nThe directors may exercise the power to make calls as conferred by Section 119 of the Alberta Insurance Act in the measure therein provided from time to time on the members in respect to all moneys unpaid on their shares, one tenth of the nominal amount of the share or be payable at a date less than one month from the date fixed for payment of the last call, and each shareholder shall be liable to pay the call. Furthermore, the prospectus which was issued by the company, when the sales were offered to the public, provided as follows:\u2014\nThe company now proposes to offer for sale to the public 2,500 shares of its capital stock at $115 per share, subject to the right of the directors at any time to withdraw this offer.\nThe full sum of 1115 is to be paid by such instalments as the directors may see fit, subject to the provisions of The Insurance Act. The sub-scribers will require to pay on application $27.50 per share of which $15 is a premium. The premium will be used to cover the costs of procuring incorporation and of subscriptions for stock. $12.50 only will be marked on the stock certificate as paid up and the subscriber will be liable for an additional $87.50 per share which, however, can only be called in 10 per cent calls at thirty-day intervals.\nThe application for the purchase of shares was in the following terms:\u2014\nGentlemen: Having paid to Mr................................... the sum of.................................. being a deposit of $22.50 per share on...................................... shares in the above named company of which $10 is premium and $12.50 is the first call per share, I hereby request you to allot me............ shares in the above named company, upon the terms of the company's prospectus, dated the....................day of.....................A.D. 1923, and I hereby agree to accept the same or any smaller number, which may be allotted to me, and covenant and agree to pay the balance of $.......... per share on call as provided by the said prospectus and I hereby authorize you to register me the holder of the said shares.\nIt is submitted on behalf of the appellant that the provisions of the Alberta Insurance Act, the company's bylaws, and the prospectus which restrict the directors of the company from making a call except by instalments and after notice, as well as the form of application for shares, have no bearing on the right of the liquidator in a winding-up to call for full balance due on the shares.\nThis submission is based on a decision given by Mr. Justice Kekewich In Re Cordova Union Gold Company 8, where he held that the contract for payment by instalments was determined by the Winding-Up Act of England, and that the liquidator was entitled to make an immediate call for the amount remaining unpaid in respect of the shares.\nThe appellant also relies upon the case of Irma Cooperative Co. Ltd. 9 in which it was decided that a contributory to an insolvent company is liable to pay the full balance owing on his shares, although under the subscription contract such balance is not due, being payable by instalments.\nIn 1919, the precise question came before Mr. Justice Walsh on appeal from the Master at Calgary, in Re The Alliance Investment Company (Canada) Limited (In Liquidation) 10. The head note reads:\u2014\nUnder the Winding-Up Act, R.S.C. 1906, Ch. 144, leave will not be granted to call up the whole amount remaining unpaid on shares, where the time fixed for payment by the terms of the shareholder's application has not arrived.\nMr. Justice Walsh based his judgment on section 58 of the Winding-Up Act which is now section 60, para. 2, and which says:\u2014\nNo call shall compel payment of a debt before the maturity thereof, and that the extent of the liability of any contributory shall not be increased by anything in this section contained.\nMr. Justice Walsh pointed out that section 102 in the English Companies Act, 1862, (206 of The Companies Act, 1929), is in almost the same language as section 57 (59 at present) of the Dominion Winding-Up Act, and as the first sentence of section 58 (at present 60(1)). These sections are the sections which empower the Court to make calls upon the contributories, but there is nothing in the English Act which corresponds with section 60(2), and which is clearly to the effect that under the Winding-Up Act, no call shall compel payment of a debt before its maturity. And it is also made very clear that the extent of the liability of a contributory cannot be increased by the mere fact of the winding-up.\nThe Irma case (supra) can easily be distinguished from the present case, as it appears from the reasons of Mr. Justice Tweedie, that he based his conclusions on the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act in which, section 60(2) of the Winding-up Act or its equivalent, is not found.\nI have no hesitation to reach the conclusion that section 60, para. 2, of the Winding-Up Act clearly applies. The liability of the contributories must be determined by the provisions of section 119(9) of the Alberta Insurance Act, by the terms of the By-law of the company, as well as by the conditions mentioned in the prospectus. In view of the opinion expressed in the case of Patterson et al v. Burton, that the contracts of sale are void, I attach no importance to the forms of application.\nThe appeal should be dismissed, with costs to be paid to both parties out of the assets of the company.\nRand J.:\u2014The question here is whether, in making a call in the winding-up of this company for the sum of $85 unpaid on the issued shares, the liquidator is bound by section 119(9) of the Insurance Act of Alberta, in these words:\u2014\n(9) The shares of the capital stock subscribed for shall be paid by such instalments and at such times and places as the directors appoint; the first instalment shall not exceed 25 per cent and no subsequent instalment shall exceed 10 per cent and not less than 30 days' notice of any call shall be given, and no call shall be made at a less interval than 30 days from the last preceding call.\nIn addition to that provision, the Articles of Association contained a similar clause.\nThe controversy arises out of the application of section 60(2) of the Winding-Up Act which reads:\u2014\n(2) No call shall compel payment of a debt before the maturity thereof, and that the extent of the liability of any contributory shall not be increased by anything in this section contained.\nIf section 119(9) appeared alone in the Insurance Act, it would, I think, bring the case within the language of section 60(2); but section 135 of the Insurance Act, dealing with the liability of shareholders contains these provisions:\u2014\n(1) Every shareholder shall, until the whole amount of his stock has been paid up, be individually liable to any creditor of the company to an amount equal to that not paid up thereon; but shall not be liable to an action therefor by any creditor until an execution against the company at the suit of the creditor has been returned unsatisfied in whole or in part.\n(2) The amount remaining unpaid by the shareholder on his stock shall be the maximum amount recoverable from him, but if action is brought against him he shall also be liable to pay such costs as may be awarded against him.\nThe question to be decided is this: What, for the purposes of the proceedings, is the maturity of the liability to pay the balance owing fixed by the Insurance Act? The presence of section 135 by which a creditor is entitled to sue a shareholder for that balance, indicates, I think, a limitation on section 119(9); obviously, the terms of call of the latter are there disregarded; and as the two provisions must be reconciled, on what can that be done except the assumption that section 119(9) is not intended to operate against creditors? As against them, the balance is due from the time of purchase. Since an order for liquidation is an execution for all creditors, the section is without application or effect vis a vis the liquidator: at the moment of liquidation it has lost the possibility of maturity beyond it. Viewed in another aspect, the terms apply only in the case of a call made by directors and while the company is carrying on business. Similarly the article to the same effect as section 119(9) is overridden by the effect of section 135. This is not, of course, the same thing as construing the rights of the liquidator under the Winding-Up Act to override the terms of section 119(9) or the article; it is simply finding that neither, in such a case, furnishes a continuing time or maturity to which section 60(2) could apply. This was in substance the ground on which Macdonald, J., on the application, proceeded, and I think he was right.\nIn ascertaining the intention of Parliament underlying section 60(2), it must be kept in mind that administering a bankrupt estate is a very practical matter in which delays produce general inconvenience. In subjecting it to contractual or statutory stipulations of this nature we ought not to exceed what is clearly indicated by the legislature, which is simply to respect the terms of the debt. To do otherwise would be to disregard the original basis of limited liability in joint stock companies. When members of such an association were individually liable for all debts, no agreement between them as to the amount of or the times for payment of their contributions could avail against creditors; and the application of such a restriction as that of section 60(2) would not be justified beyond the precise language, in this case, of the legislation dealing with terms of payment.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and declare that the call may be made without relation to the terms of section 119(9). Estey J.:\u2014The appellant is the liquidator of The Home Assurance Company of Canada and the respondents are the contributories.\nIn this appeal, the appellant contends that a call may be made upon the contributories for any balance that may be owing under a contract for the purchase of shares, while the respondents submit it cannot be made except for amounts and within the periods permitted under sec. 119(9) of The Alberta Insurance Act (St. of Alta. 1915, c. 8, now R.S.A. 1942, c. 201, s. 119(9).\nMr. Justice Macdonald authorized \"the liquidator to make a call on each of the contributories \u2026 for one hundred per cent of the amount for which they are or may be respectively settled upon the list of contributories.\" This judgment was reversed in the Appellate Division and a direction made that the calls should be made at amounts and intervals specified by section 119(9) of The Alberta Insurance Act.\nSec. 119(9) reads as follows:\n(9) The shares of the capital stock subscribed for shall be paid by such instalments and at such times and places as the directors appoint; the first instalment shall not exceed 25 per cent and no subsequent instalment shall exceed 10 per cent, and not less than 30 days' notice of any call shall be given, and no call shall be made at a less interval than 30 days from the last preceding call.\nThe Home Assurance Company of Canada was incorporated by special statute enacted by the Legislature of Alberta (1918 St. Alta., Ch. 58). Section 9 of that Act directed that the provisions of the Alberta Insurance Act including the above sec. 119(9), should apply to the company.\nThe express language of this section including as it does the words \"as the directors appoint\", discloses that the legislature intended this section should apply only while the directors were directing the affairs of the company. This is emphasized by the fact that section 152 of The Alberta Insurance Act incorporates the Winding-Up provisions of the Companies Act of Alberta (R.S.A. 1942, c. 240).\nSection 164 of the Companies Act reads as follows:\n164. The liability of a contributory shall create a debt of the nature of a specialty, accruing due from him at the time when his liability commenced, but payable at the times when calls are made for enforcing the liability. Sec. 164 discloses that the legislature intended in the event of a winding-up the terms of the payment under a contract for the purchase of shares would be superseded by the provisions of that section. A reading of these two sections makes it clear that the legislature intended sec. 119(9) should apply prior to winding-up proceedings, but once they were commenced the provisions of sec. 164 should apply.\nWhile this company is not being wound up under sec. 164 and, therefore, its provisions do not apply to these proceedings, they do, when read with sec. 119(9), indicate on the part of the legislature an intention that calls should be made once winding-up proceedings are commenced in accord with the statutory provisions under which those proceedings may be taken. This company is being wound up under The Dominion Winding-Up Act (1927 R.S.C., c. 213). The relevant provisions are sections 50, 53, 55, 59 and 60(2).\nIt is upon the provisions of section 60(2) that the Appellate Division founded its judgment and upon which the respondent bases its submission.\nSection 60(2) reads as follows:\n60 (2). No call shall compel payment of a debt before the maturity thereof, and that the extent of the liability of any contributory shall not be increased by anything in this section contained. R.S., c. 144, s. 58.\nSec. 50 provides that at the commencement of the winding-up, the list of contributories shall be settled and sec. 53 that \"every shareholder \u2026 shall be liable to contribute the amount unpaid on his shares.\" Sec. 53(2) provides that the liability of the contributory shall be deemed \"a debt due to the company payable as directed or appointed under this Act,\" and sec. 55, the liability of the contributory \"shall create a debt accruing due from such person at the time when his liability commenced but payable at the time or respective times when calls are made as hereinafter mentioned for enforcing such liability.\" Sec. 59 provides that \"the Court may at any time after making a winding-up order \u2026 make calls on and order payment thereof by all or any of the contributories \u2026 to the extent of their liability.\"\nThe foregoing provisions of sections 50 to 59 are in effect similar to those in the Companies Act, 1862 of Great Britain (25 & 26 Vict., Ch. 89). Under that provision, it has been held that the terms of payment in the contract endured \"only during the life of the company\" and, therefore, the liquidator might call up the whole of the unpaid balance at any time after winding-up proceedings have been commenced. In re Cordova Union Gold Company 11.\nThe respondent, however, points out that sec. 60(2) in The Dominion Winding-up Act has no counterpart in the British Act, and that as it provides \"no calls shall compel payment of a debt before the maturity thereof,\" the terms of the original contract must be adhered to in the making of calls. The sections 50 to 60(2) inclusive are all under the general heading \"contributories\" and when read together the debt referred to in sec. 60(2) is that created by sec. 53(2), and which under sec. 55 is \"accruing due from such person at the time the liability commenced but payable at the time \u2026 when calls are made \u2026\" Then in sec. 59, it is already pointed out the Court may at any time make calls and order payment to the extent of the liability of the contributories.\nMoreover, the foregoing is in accord with the intent and purpose of winding-up proceedings, which are designed to realize the assets of a company and to distribute them among the creditors as soon as circumstances may permit.\nThese sections, and particularly sec. 59, contemplate such an order as that made by Mr. Justice Macdonald. His order should be restored. The appeal allowed with the costs of the parties hereto payable out of the assets of the company.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fenerty, Fenerty, McGillivray and Robertson.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Patterson, Hobbs and Patterson.\n1 30 C.B.R. 234.\n2 (1891) 2 Ch. 580.\n3 (1893) 2 Q.B. 266 at 272.\n4 (1890) 44 Ch. 534 at 583.\n5 (1905) 5 O.W.R. 542.\n6 [1919] 1 W.W.R. 17.\n7 [1950] S.C.R. 578.\n8 (1891) 2 Ch. 580.\n9 [1925] 1 D.L.R. 27.\n10 [1919] 1 W.W.R. 117.\n11 (1891) 2 Ch. 580.\n",

Robinson K.C. for the appellants.\nF. A. Sheppard K.C. and A. J. MacLeod for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by Kellock J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court, Cameron J. 2, affirming the decision of the Minister on an appeal against an assessment for succession duties. The appellants are each entitled to life interests in the residuary estate of the late Mary Catherine Fisher, deceased, and the only matter in dispute between the parties is the value of one item of that residue, namely, the interest of the said estate in the estate of the late Charles Woodward, deceased, the father of the said Mary Catherine Fisher.\nBy his will and codicil, the late Charles Woodward bequeathed to a sister and a brother, out of the income to be received by his trustees from his Vancouver real estate, an annuity of $200 per month each, during their respective lives and, subject thereto, he directed that such income should be distributed annually between three persons, of whom the deceased daughter was one, during a period ending with the death of the last survivor of four named persons. It has been held by a judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia that the interest of the deceased Mary Catherine Fisher did not determine with her death but continued for the benefit of her estate. It is to be noted that the late Mary Catherine Fisher died on 23rd October, 1943, after the Succession Duty Act came into force, but her father, the late Charles Woodward, died prior thereto, his estate, therefore, not being subject to the provisions of the statute.\nIn valuing the interest of the daughter in her father's estate, the Minister applied the provisions of section 34 of the Act, as he did also in valuing the respective interests of the appellants in the estate of their testatrix. The appellants do not object to the application of the section in this last-mentioned respect, but they contend that the Minister erred in applying the provisions of the section in ascertaining the value of the asset here in question as part of the residuary estate of Mary Catherine Fisher. The appellants say that s. 34 is not, but that the provisions of s. 2(a) and (e) and s. 5(1) are applicable.\nS. 34 is as follows:\nThe value of every annuity, term of years, life estate, income, or other estate, and of every interest in expectancy in respect of the succession to which duty is payable under this Act shall for the purposes of this Act be determined by such rule, method and standard of mortality and of value, and at such rate of interest as from time to time the Minister may decide. (1940-41, c. 14, s. 34).\nThe important words for present purposes are the words, \"in respect of the succession to which duty is payable under this Act.\" The only successions in respect of which duty is payable under the Act are the successions of the appellants to the estate of Mary Catherine Fisher. The section in its clear terms, therefore, has no application to anything but the valuation for duty purposes of the interests of the appellants in that estate. Paragraphs (a) and (e) of s. 2 and s. 5(1) are as follows:\n2. (a) \"aggregate net value\" means the fair market value as at the date of death, of all the property of the deceased, wherever situated, together with the fair market value, as at the said date, of all such other property wherever situated, mentioned and described in section three of this Act, as deemed to be included in a succession or successions, as the case may be, from the deceased as predecessor, after the debts, incumbrances, and other allowances are deducted therefrom as authorized by subsection six of section seven and by section eight of this Act.\n(e) \"dutiable value\" means, in the case of the death of a person domiciled in Canada, the fair market value, as at the date of death, of all property included in a succession to a successor less the allowances as authorized by subsection six of section seven and by section eight of this Act and less the value of real property situated outside of Canada, and means, in the case of the death of a person domiciled outside of Canada, the fair market value of property situated in Canada of the deceased included in a succession to a successor less the allowances as authorized by subsection six of section seven and by sections eight and nine of this Act.\n5. (1) Notwithstanding that the value of the property included in a succession to which each heir, legatee, substitute, institute, residuary beneficiary, or other successor is entitled, cannot in any case be determined until the time of distribution, nevertheless, for the purposes of this Act, all such property shall be valued as of the date of death, and each successor shall be deemed to benefit as if such property less the allowances as authorized by section eight of this Act were immediately distributed, and as if each successor benefited accordingly.\nIn my opinion, the appellants are right in their contention that the value of the asset of the Fisher estate here in question falls to be determined under the provisions of s. 2(a) and (e) and s. 5(1), in other words, at the fair market value at the date of the death of Mary Catherine Fisher on 23 October, 1943.\nAlthough it is not raised by the pleadings, Mr. Sheppard for the respondent contends that s. 58(2) is applicable independently of s. 34, and that under the relevant regulation the same result is arrived at as if the provisions of s. 34 applied. S. 58(2), so far as material, is as follows:\nThe Minister may make any regulations deemed necessary for carrying this Act into effect, and in particular may make regulations:\u2014\n(c) prescribing what rule, method and standard of mortality and of value, and what rate of interest shall be used in determining the value of annuities, terms of years, life estates, income, and interests in expectancy.\nThe only regulation to which we were referred is regulation 19 which reads in part as follows:\n19. (1) The value of every annuity, term of years, life estate, income, or other estate and of every interest in expectancy, shall be determined,\n(ii) if the succession depends on life contingencies, on the basis of interest as aforesaid, together with the standard of mortality as defined in Table II below \u2026 In my opinion, the terms of this regulation are thus expressly limited, as is s. 34 itself, to the valuation of the interests mentioned which are included in the succession, the duty in respect of which is being determined. Again, both a basis of interest and a standard of mortality enter into the computation and it is clear from Table II itself, which bears the heading, \"Standard of mortality prescribed for the purposes of section 34\", that the basis of computation prescribed by the regulation is for use only under that section. Even if s. 58 could stand alone, therefore, no regulation has been passed under it which could apply to the valuation of the item here in question as part of the residuary estate of Mary Catherine Fisher.\nAppellants also asked in their statement of claim that the court should determine the fair market value, and both parties led evidence on the point.\nIn determining the fair market value where there is no competitive market at the date as of which the value is to be ascertained, other indicia may be resorted to as pointed out by Sir Lyman Duff C.J. in Montreal Island Power Co. v. Town of Laval des Rapides 3. The learned Chief Justice went on to say:\u2014\nThere may be reasonable prospects of the return of a market, in which case it might not be unreasonable for the assessor to evaluate the present worth of such prospects and the probability of an investor being found who would invest his money on the strength of such prospects; and there may be other relevant circumstances which it might be proper to take into account as evidence of its actual capital value.\nThis principle was applied by this court for succession duty purposes in Attorney General of Alberta v. Royal Trust Company 4. The subject matter of that case was the value of land and buildings, and the court took into consideration the revenue producing qualities of the property.\nThe respondent contends that the item here in question is \"a bequest of $10,000 a year\", that is, \"a bequest of one-third of the annual rental of $80,000.\" The appellants, on the other hand, contend that their testatrix was entitled only to \"one-third of the net income\" from the property in question; that the gross rental was subject to certain charges and one annuity to one of the two annuitants who survived Mrs. Fisher; and that payment of the rent was further subject to certain contingencies, such as, for example, the continued solvency of the tenant.\nFrom the standpoint of the outstanding annuity alone, the income from the rent was obviously subject to reduction to that extent. In addition, the trustees of the Woodward estate were entitled under the Trustee Act of British Columbia to compensation, and the income from the rents would be subject to some reduction on this account. It is further pointed out that the lease contains the usual exception of reasonable wear and tear and damage by fire and tempest from the lessee's covenant to repair, and that this would involve some expenditure on the part of the Woodward estate to keep the building intact. The witnesses for both parties agree that such expense together with the expense of extra insurance, which the owners as a matter of good business practice should carry, would total approximately $3,000 per year. It cannot, therefore, be said that there was \"a bequest of $10,000 per year.\"\nFurther, while the rent is collaterally secured by two mortgages given by the tenant on adjoining property owned by it, and while the lessee covenanted to pay rent, taxes, light, gas and telephone charges, and to return the property at the end of the term with a building thereon worth not less than $125,000 in a good and sufficient state of repair, and to keep the building insured for $100,000, one cannot disregard entirely the possibility of insolvency of the tenant or even the possibility of some disaster occurring during the term of the lease, which had some 44 years to run at the date of Mrs. Fisher's death. A purchaser would no doubt make some allowance for such eventualities.\nPerhaps the two most outstanding features of this asset are, first, the uncertainty of the term, in that it depends upon four fives, one of those lives being that of a person at the date of Mrs. Fisher's death engaged in combat service in the Royal Canadian Air Force. The other important consideration is that the asset is not a capital asset but income, and therefore subject in the hands of a purchaser to income taxation.\nThe appellants called two experts with respect to value. One, William Reeve, said that the asset would be a very difficult thing to sell as it involved considerations of a highly speculative nature. He himself had had no actual experience in selling such an interest. In his opinion, the fair market value would be not more than $67,230. He arrived at that figure by taking the annual net income as $9,000 and considering that any purchaser would require the return of his capital in not more than twenty years and would expect an interest rate of 12 per cent. In the opinion of the other witness called by the appellants, D. S. Mansell, a purchaser might have been found in October 1943 who would have paid $55,000. He pointed out, in addition to the factors already mentioned, that at that date the country was engaged in a world war. His figure of $55,000, he said, was on the basis of return of the principal within 13 \u00bd years with interest at 4 per cent.\nThe witness called for the respondent made a valuation of $150,000 but left entirely out of consideration the fact that the subject matter of sale was income and therefore subject in the hands of a purchaser to income tax. For this reason alone I think his evidence is to be disregarded.\nOn all the evidence, there would be no justification, in my opinion, for putting a higher value upon the asset in question than the figure given by Mr. Reeve, namely, $67,230, on the basis of the income being $9,000 per year, which may well be too high.\nIt was suggested by Mr. Boultbee, the respondent's witness, that the element of uncertainty as to the duration of the term could be eliminated by the purchase of life insurance. It may well be that this would be the case, but the premium or premiums would be substantial and would involve an increase in the purchaser's outlay. The evidence with respect to this aspect of the matter was not sufficiently related to the computation of value to permit of the fixing of an amount greater than $67,230, the higher of the two figures put forward by the appellants.\nI therefore would allow the appeal and reduce the valuation to the figure mentioned. The appellants should have their costs here and below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Robinson and Haines.\nSolicitor for the respondent: I. G. Ross.\n1 [1950] Ex.

VI (Imp.), and \"An Act to approve the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada\", 1949 (Can.) 1st Sess., c. 1, Newfoundland became a province of the Dominion of Canada. Thereupon the legislative powers theretofore possessed by Newfoundland became vested in the Parliament of Canada and the legislature of the Province of Newfoundland in accordance with sections 91 and 92 of the B.N.A. Act.\nBetween the years 1915 and 1947 the Government of Newfoundland entered into a series of agreements, subsequently in part confirmed and in part enacted by the Newfoundland Legislature, with Bowater's Pulp & Paper Mills Ltd., and their predecessors in interest, whereby that company was granted exemptions for a term of years (extending beyond the date of union with Canada) from customs duties and taxes on certain imports and exports and from other taxes including income tax. By \"An Act to amend The Income Tax Act and the Income War Tax Act\", 1949 (Can.) 2nd Sess., c. 25, s. 49, Parliament provided that notwithstanding any other law heretofore enacted by a legislative authority other than the Parliament of Canada (including a law of Newfoundland enacted prior to April 1, 1949) no person is entitled to\n(a) any deduction, exemption or immunity from, or any privilege in respect of\n(i) any duty or tax imposed by an Act of the Parliament of Canada, or\n(ii) any obligation under an Act of the Parliament of Canada imposing any duty or tax, or\n(b) any exemption or immunity from any provision in an Act of the Parliament of Canada requiring a licence, permit or certificate for the export or import of goods, unless provision for such deduction, exemption, immunity or privilege is expressly made by the Parliament of Canada.\nFollowing the passing of the said Act, the Governor in Council under s. 55 of The Supreme Court Act referred to this Court the three questions, (which are fully set out in the reasons for judgment that follow), as to the effect of the said amendment on the said exemptions. Held: (Taschereau J. dissenting) that:\u2014\n(1) Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp & Paper Mills Ltd. is not entitled by reason of the certain Statutes of Newfoundland in question, to any deduction, exemption or immunity from or any privilege in respect of any duty or tax imposed by an Act of the Parliament of Canada.\n(2) The company is not entitled by reason of the said Statutes of Newfoundland, to any deduction or exemption or immunity from, or any privilege in respect of any obligation under any Act of the Parliament of Canada imposing any duty or tax.\n(3) The company is not entitled by reason of the said Statutes of Newfoundland, to any exemption or immunity from any provision in an Act of the Parliament of Canada requiring a licence, permit or certificate for the export or import of goods.\nREFERENCE by His Excellency the Governor General in Council (P.C. 6510, dated December 29, 1949) to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration pursuant to the authority of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 35, s. 55 of the questions cited in full at the beginning of the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice of this Court.\nF.

Reward, K.C, for Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp & Paper Mills Ltd.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014The following questions of law, touching the interpretation of the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1949, have been referred to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration:\n1. Is Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp & Paper Mills Ltd. entitled by reason of the Statutes of Newfoundland listed hereunder to any deduction, exemption or immunity from, or any privilege in respect of any duty or tax imposed by an Act of the Parliament of Canada?\n2.

Is Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp & Paper Mills Ltd. entitled by reason of the Statutes of Newfoundland listed hereunder to any exemption or immunity from any provision in an Act of the Parliament of Canada requiring a licence, permit or certificate for the export or import of goods? List of Statutes referred to in the above questions:\nNewfoundland 1. 6 Geo. V, c. 4 (1915)\n2. 8 Geo. V, c. 3 (1917)\n3. 9-10 Geo. V, c. 12 (1919)\n4. 14 Geo. V, c. 1 (1923)\n5. 15 Geo.

VI, c. 56 (1943)\n12. 11 Geo. VI, c. 8 (1947)\nUpon the reference, this court heard arguments from counsel representing the Attorney-General of Canada, the Attorney-General of Newfoundland and the Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp and Paper Mills, Ltd.\nThe statutes of Newfoundland referred to in the questions are all statutes enacted by the Governor, Legislative Council and House of Assembly of Newfoundland or the Governor by and with the advice of the Commission of Government before the union of Newfoundland with Canada. No question is raised as to the validity or effect of these statutes before the union.\nSubstantially all of these statutes are concerned with giving effect to and carrying out so-called agreements between a corporation and the government of Newfoundland. The 1915 to 1919 statutes were enacted in relation to the Newfoundland Products Corporation, Ltd. The name of this company was then changed to the Newfoundland Power and Paper Company Ltd. and the 1923 and 1925 statutes use this name. The 1927 statutes, amongst other things, confirm the substitution under the agreements of a new corporation for the earlier one, the new corporation being the International Paper Company of Newfoundland Ltd, Thereafter, the name of this corporation was changed on November 9, 1927, to \"International Power and Paper Company of Newfoundland Ltd.\" and on August 18, 1938, to \"Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd., the present name of the company. Since all the statutes and agreements now relate to the last-named company, reference will be made only to the \"company\", by which is meant the last-named company. The original operations of the company were the utilization of water powers and mineral resources in Newfoundland for the manufacture of a fertilizer. Subsequently, the operations were extended to the generation of power for the manufacture of pulp and paper products. Later still, the operations of the company covered the cutting and export of timber and related activities. The executive government of Newfoundland and the company, apparently, from time to time conducted negotiations as to the operations of the company. The government was interested in promoting the development of industry in Newfoundland. The company was interested in obtaining water powers, lands, mineral rights, timber rights and concessions for its operations. It also, apparently, needed the financial support of the government by way of guaranteeing loans raised by the company. As a result of these negotiations these so-called agreements were arrived at between the company and the executive government.\nThe agreements, amongst other things, contained terms making special provision as to the taxation of the company and in respect of activities carried on by it. The agreement of 1927 appears to have supplanted, for practical purposes, earlier provisions for this purpose in the agreements of 1923 and 1915. Clause 2 of the 1927 agreement contains extensive provisions both new and by way of amendment to earlier provisions. Its provisions were also later amended by the 1938 agreement.\nThe effect of the taxation provisions of these agreements and statutes, still in force before the union of Newfoundland to Canada, may be stated generally speaking as follows:\n(b) The stock and shares and the bonds, debentures, debenture stock, mortgage and other securities of the company, and all issues, transfers, sales and other dispositions of, purchases, holding and receipts of the same, and the dividends on such stock and shares and interest on such securities, and the receipt thereof by the holder other than holders (except the International Paper Company, a corporation of the State of New York, or any successor to substantially all its property and assets or any subsidiary of said International Paper Company or of its said successor) domiciled in Newfoundland, shall be exempt from taxation for a period of fifty years from the date hereof, provided that the company shall not be exempt from any fees payable upon the registration in the Registry of Deeds of a document, deed or instrument which apply to all documents, deeds and instruments generally. (1927 Agreement; cl. 2 para. (b) unamended; Case p. 60, 1. 12.)\n(c) The company shall pay to the government in respect of its income for each year, beginning with the year 1928, and ending with the year 1973, before deduction of interest, depreciation and depletion, a tax of twenty per cent of such income, provided that if the tax in any year so calculated would exceed the maximum tax below defined the income applicable to the payment of interest and to depreciation and depletion shall be exempt from taxation to such extent as shall be necessary in order that the tax shall not exceed the maximum tax below defined, and provided further that if the tax so calculated after exempting all income applicable to the payment of interest and to depreciation and depletion would still exceed the maximum tax below defined, then the rate per cent for calculation of the tax shall be reduced to such extent as shall be necessary in order that the tax shall not exceed the maximum tax below defined. The maximum tax in respect of the income for each of the years 1928, 1929, 1930 and 1931 shall be $75,000, and for each of the years 1932 to 1973, inclusive, shall be $150,000. Dividends and interest received by the company shall be included in its income. Such tax shall be payable on or before March 31 of the succeeding year. And except as aforesaid and subject to Section 3 of the Act of 1915 the company shall be exempt from all taxation of every kind whatsoever other than duties (including Sales Tax) levied under the general laws of the colony on goods imported by the company and not otherwise exempt. Provided, however, that nothing in this clause contained shall be construed to exempt individual officers, shareholders or employees of the company from any taxation otherwise payable by them: Provided further that this clause shall remain in force during the period ending 30th June, 1973, and after that date shall cease to have effect in toto. (1923 Act, s. 13; Case p. 27, 1. 35 as amended by 1927 Agreement cl. 2, para.

For the purpose of giving effect to this provision it shall be assumed (a) that the coal consumed by the company in its Corner Brook mills in each year up to but not exceeding 20,000 tons is coal imported otherwise than for such operation as aforesaid and the same shall accordingly be liable to payment of duty under Clause 2(h) of the Agreement of 1927 and (b) that the coal consumed by the company as aforesaid in each year in excess of 20,000 tons is coal imported for such operations as aforesaid and the same shall accordingly be free of duties and taxes.\n31. Save as mentioned in the foregoing clauses of this agreement no unmanufactured timber exported by the company under this agreement shall be subject to the payment of any tax duty or charge.\n32.

(Case p. 55, 1. 17).\nThe remaining provisions amended various provisions of the agreement or dealt with related matters. (Case pp. 56-7).\nThe Act of 1938 relating to the 1938 Agreement provides as follows:\n1. The agreement made between His Excellency Sir Humphrey Thomas Walwyn, K.C.S.I., C.B., D.S.O., Governor of Newfoundland and its Dependencies in Commission of the one part and Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp and Paper Mills Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of Newfoundland and having its registered office at Corner Brook in the Island of Newfoundland of the other part, dated the 29th day of November, A.D. 1938, and forming the schedule to this Act is hereby approved and confirmed and declared to be valid and binding upon the parties thereto.\n2. In Clause 5 of the agreement forming the schedule to this Act there shall be inserted after the words \"riots or civil commotions\" the words \"or by adverse commercial or economic conditions existing in any season or seasons which the company shall show to the satisfaction of the government make it reasonable for the company not to comply with such obligations in whole or in part\" and the figures and words \"25 cents\" shall be struck out and the words \"two dollars\" substituted therefor 3. Subject to the amendments above set forth, all and singular the several clauses and provisions of the said agreement set forth in the schedule hereto are hereby declared to have the force and effect of law for all purposes as if expressly enacted herein.\n4.

(Case p. 84).\nSections 49 and 50 of \"An Act to amend The Income Tax Act and the Income War Tax Act\", c. 25, S. of C. 1949 (2 Sess.) provide as follows:\n49. For greater certainty it is hereby declared and enacted that, notwithstanding any other law heretofore enacted by a legislative authority other than the Parliament of Canada (including a law of Newfoundland enacted prior to the first day of April nineteen hundred and forty-nine), no person is entitled to\n(a) any deduction, exemption or immunity from, or any privilege in respect of,\n(i) any duty or tax imposed by an Act of the Parliament of Canada, or\n(ii) any obligation under an Act of the Parliament of Canada imposing any duty or tax, or\n(b) any exemption or immunity from any provision in an Act of the Parliament of Canada requiring a licence, permit or certificate for the export or import of goods, unless provision for such deduction, exemption, immunity or privilege is expressly made by the Parliament of Canada.\n50. Notwithstanding anything contained in this or any other Act an exemption from taxation provided for in an international treaty or international agreement binding on Newfoundland before the union of Newfoundland with Canada may be extended by regulation of the Governor in Council to taxation by or under any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe Attorney General of Canada submits that the answer to each of the three questions referred to the Court should be in the negative because:\n(1) The statutes referred to in the questions ceased to operate at the time of the Union of Newfoundland with Canada;\n(2) Even if these statutes continued in operation after the Union they do not apply in respect of Acts of the Parliament of Canada extended to Newfoundland pursuant to the Union to confer any deduction, exemption, immunity or privilege in respect of a duty, tax, obligation or requirement imposed thereunder;\n(3) Even if these statutes continued in operation and any of the provisions thereof apply in respect of Acts of the Parliament of Canada to confer any deduction, exemption, immunity or privilege in respect of a duty, tax, obligation or requirement under an Act of the Parliament of Canada, they have been overridden by section 49 of the \"Act to amend The Income Tax Act and the Income War Tax Act\" (Ch. 25, Statutes of Canada, 1949\u2014Second Session), which is validly enacted by Parliament within its authority under the British North America Acts, 1867-1949.\nThe Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada approved and given force of law by the British North America Act, 1949, are Terms 3 and 18:\n3. The British North America Acts, 1867 to 1946, shall apply to the Province of Newfoundland in the same way, and to the like extent as they apply to the provinces heretofore comprised in Canada, as if the Provice of Newfoundland had been one of the provinces originally united, except in so far as varied by these terms and except such provisions as are in terms made or by reasonable intendment may be held to be specially applicable to or only to affect one or more and not all of the provinces originally united.\n18. (1) Subject to these terms, all laws in force in Newfoundland at or immediately prior to the date of Union shall continue therein as if the Union had not been made, subject nevertheless to be repealed, abolished, or altered by the Parliament of Canada or by the Legislature of the Province of Newfoundland according to the authority of the Parliament or of the Legislature under the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1946, and all orders, rules, and regulations made under any such laws shall likewise continue, subject to be revoked or amended by the body or person that made such orders, rules or regulations or the body or person that has power to make such orders, rules, or regulations after the date of Union, according to their respective authority under the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1946.\n(2) Statutes of the Parliament of Canada in force at the date of Union, or any part thereof, shall come into force in the Province of Newfoundland on a day or days to be fixed by Act of the Parliament of Canada or by proclamation of the Governor General in Council issued from time to time, and any such proclamation may provide for the repeal of any of the laws of Newfoundland that\n(a) are of general application;\n(b) relate to the same subject-matter as the statute or part thereof so proclaimed; and\n(c) could be repealed by the Parliament of Canada under paragraph one of this term.\n(3) Notwithstanding anything in these terms the Parliament of Canada may with the consent of the Legislature of the Province of Newfoundland repeal any law in force in Newfoundland at the date of Union.\n(4) Except as otherwise provided by these terms all courts of civil and criminal jurisdiction and all legal commissions, powers, authorities, and functions, and all officers and functionaries, judicial, administrative, and ministerial, existing in Newfoundland at or immediately prior to the date of Union, shall continue in the Province of Newfoundland as if the Union had not been made, until altered, abolished, revoked, terminated, or dismissed by the appropriate authority under the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1946.\nThe effect of Terms 3 and 18 of the Terms of Union of Newfoundland is first that the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1946, will apply to the Province of New- foundland in the same way and to the like extent as they apply to the provinces heretofore comprised in Canada, as if the Province of Newfoundland had been one of the provinces originally united. The only exceptions are if they are varied by the Terms, or if they are in the provisions which may be held to be specially applicable to or only to affect one or more and not all of the provinces originally united.\nFurthermore, subject to the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada, all laws in force in Newfoundland at or immediately prior to the date of union continued therein \"as if the union had not been made\".\nThose laws, nevertheless, may be repealed, abolished or altered by the Parliament of Canada or by the Legislature of the Province of Newfoundland according to the authority of the Parliament or of the Legislature under the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1946.\nIn addition, all orders, rules and regulations made under any such laws continued, subject to be revoked or amended by the body or person that made such orders, rules or regulations, or the body or person that has power to make such orders, rules or regulations after the date of union according to their respective authority under the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1946.\nIn my opinion, the \"authority\" referred to in Term 18(1) is the authority which is given jurisdiction on the respective subject-matters enumerated in Sections 91 and 92 of the British North America Act, that is to say, that by force of Term 18(1) the Parliament of Canada is thereby given the authority to repeal, abolish or alter any and all laws in force in Newfoundland at or immediately prior to the date of union, which deal with the subject-matters in Section 91, and the Legislature of the Province of Newfoundland is given authority to repeal, abolish or alter all laws in force in Newfoundland at or immediately prior to the date of union which deal with the subject-matters in Section 92 of the Act.\nThat proposition is further supported by subsection (2) of Term 18, which gives to the Parliament of Canada power to put in force, either by Act of the Parliament or by proclamation of the Governor General in Council, all Statutes of Canada in force at the date of union which are of general application, or which relate to the same subject-matter as the statute or part thereof so proclaimed, and which could be repealed by the Parliament of Canada under paragraph 1 of Term 18.\nLikewise subsection (2) authorizes the Parliament of Canada to repeal any of the laws of Newfoundland thus mentioned in that subsection. It is to be noted that subsection (1) of Term 18 is slightly different, for example, from the corresponding terms in the Acts of Union with Alberta and Saskatchewan.\nIt is said here that the laws of Newfoundland shall remain in force \"as if the union had not been made\" which means, to my mind, that notwithstanding that those laws may be dealing with subject-matters rightly coming under the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada under Section 91 of the British North America Act, they might nevertheless not cease to operate immediately upon the date of the union until they are repealed, abolished or altered by the Parliament of Canada. But I do not think that we need consider that possible interpretation for the purpose of answering the three questions submitted to the court and which refer only to Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp and Paper Mills, Limited.\nI wish, therefore, to make it well understood that any general proposition laid down in the present opinion is strictly limited to that company and to the questions as they are submitted.\nIn this case, the Parliament of Canada by section 49 of an Act to amend The Income Tax Act and the Income War Tax Act, assented to 10th December, 1949, has legislated that, \"notwithstanding any other law heretofore enacted by a legislative authority other than the Parliament of Canada (including a law of Newfoundland enacted prior to the first day of April nineteen hundred and forty-nine), no person is entitled to\n(a) any deduction, exemption or immunity from, or any privilege in respect of,\n(i) any duty or tax imposed by an Act of the Parliament of Canada, or\n(ii) any obligation under an Act of the Parliament of Canada imposing any duty or tax, or (b) any exemption or immunity from any provision in an Act of the Parliament of Canada requiring a licence, permit or certificate for the export or import of goods,\nunless provision for such deduction, exemption, immunity or privilege is expressly made by the Parliament of Canada\".\nThe legislation contained in s. 49 clearly relates, in fact and specific terms, to the statutes of Newfoundland whereby Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp and Paper Mills, Ltd., is entitled to deductions, exemptions, immunities or privileges in respect of any duty or tax and of any obligation; and also to exemptions or immunities requiring a licence, permit or certificate for the export or import of goods.\nIt follows that by force of subsection 2(b) of Term 18 these matters relate to the same subject-matter as the statute or part thereof so proclaimed by Canada and, therefore, that pro tanto section 49 of the Income Tax Act and Income War Tax Act (S. of C. 1949 (2 Sess. c. 25)) repeals the laws of Newfoundland granting these deductions, exemptions or immunities and privileges to Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp and Paper Mills, Limited. It clearly and undoubtedly has that effect and it must be so held unless it could be successfully contended that the legislation of Parliament is unauthorized by the Terms of Union and, accordingly ultra vires.\nI am of opinion that section 49 was competently enacted both under subsection (2) and subsection) (1) of Term 18.\nThe argument of counsel for the Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp and Paper Mills, Ltd., was that the laws and agreements invoked by that company were to be looked upon as a single indivisible whole and not severable, and that subsection (3) of Term 18, which reads:\n(3) Notwithstanding anything in these terms the Parliament of Canada may with the consent of the Legislature of the Province of Newfoundland repeal any law in force in Newfoundland at the date of Union.\ntherefore applies. They say it follows that the statutes and agreements whereby the Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp and Paper Mills, Ltd., was granted its exemptions, immunities and privileges could not be done away with or altered except with the consent of the Legislature of the Province of Newfoundland. I cannot agree. Subsection (3) is limited to \"repeal\" and I would go as far as saying that that subsection may be used by the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of the Province to authorize the repeal of a law in force in Newfoundland at the date of union even if it relates to a subject-matter under section 92 of the British North America Act.\nInterpreting it as meaning that no laws of Newfoundland can be repealed, except with the consent of the Legislature of that province, would lead to an absurdity. It is only necessary to mention that the statutes and agreements concerning Newfoundland grant immunities from customs and excise duties to show that any such intention can never have entered into the minds of the drafters of the Terms of Union, for customs and excise duties clearly belong to Parliament under section 91 of the British North America Act, and, if we suppose that Newfoundland would refuse its consent to the repeal of at least that part of the statutes and agreements with Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp and Paper Mills, Ltd., the customs and excise duties owed by the latter would forever remain under the jurisdiction of Newfoundland; the Parliament of Canada would be helpless to remedy that situation and as the whole organization of customs and excise duties administration is with the Parliament of Canada, the whole matter would become unworkable.\nNor do I think that the principle of severability, as it is expounded in several decisions of this Court and of the judicial committee of the Privy Council, applies in the premises. It has come into play when the courts had to examine the validity of legislation emanating from one Parliament or Legislature, but never in a case like the present one, when we are discussing the respective authority of Parliament of the one part and the Legislatures of the other part.\nAbove all, I am of opinion that subsection (1) of Term 18 was made precisely to cover the severability resulting from the union. By force of that subsection, Parliament was recognized as the true authority henceforth to repeal, abolish or alter the laws, orders, rules or regulations having as subject-matters those which are enumerated in section 91 of the British North America Act; and the Legislature of Newfoundland, on the other hand, was given the authority to repeal, abolish or alter the laws, orders, rules or regulations which deal with the subject-matters enumerated in section 92 of the British North America Act. It could not be otherwise, and, if it had not been so, the Terms of Union could never have functioned.\nSo that the argument of indivisibility or severability not only cannot apply in the operation of the Terms of Union but it is specifically provided for in subsection (1) of Term 18.\nAs a consequence of that subsection, upon the union being consummated, all subject-matters under section 91 came under the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada and the subject-matters under section 92 remained under the jurisdiction of the Province of Newfoundland \"according to their respective authority under the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1946\".\nIt seems to me, therefore, abundantly clear that, upon the union taking place, customs and excise duties being properly in the domain of the Parliament of Canada, that Parliament became the only competent body to legislate in regard to them throughout Canada, including Newfoundland. As said before, I do not think that the questions call upon the court to say what happens in that respect during the period extending from the date of the union to the date when legislation from the Parliament of Canada is made to come into force either for the purpose of repealing, abolishing or altering.\nAs for taxes, and amongst them, income taxes or income war taxes, the situation is somewhat different for both the Parliament and the Legislatures have been given the power to tax. I would not doubt that the exemptions in respect of taxes remain in force for the benefit of the Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp and Paper Mills, Ltd., in so far as they apply to provincial taxes; but these exemptions, if sought to be invoked as against federal taxes, can of course have no effect and they become inoperative. Under no rule of interpretation can Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp and Paper Mills, Ltd., be regarded as having been given an exemption or an immunity from the taxes imposed by the Parliament of Canada. In that sense they are in no different situation from any other company in any other province of Canada. The British North America Act authorizes double taxation within the limits therein stated and innumerable examples could be given of companies enjoying exemption and immunity from provincial taxes and which, of course, does not carry exemption and immunity from federal taxes. In the present case, the imposition of federal taxes is only the imposition of an additional tax upon Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp and Paper Mills, Ltd.\u2014a situation against which, of course, the former colony of Newfoundland can never protect the Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp and Paper Mills, Ltd.\nSection 49 does not divest the Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp and Paper Mills, Ltd., of its immunities, exemptions or privileges in respect of taxes within the territory of Newfoundland. It says merely that the exemptions, immunities and privileges granted by Newfoundland do not apply with respect to federal taxes.\nHaving come to those conclusions, the answers to the questions referred to the court must be in the negative.\nTo Question No. 1, I answer no;\nTo Question No. 2, I answer no;\nTo Question No. 3, I answer no, since export or import of goods are exclusively of the competency of the Parliament of Canada.\nKerwin J.:\u2014Under section 55 of the Supreme Court Act the Governor in Council referred to this court for hearing and consideration the following questions: (See p. 609 supra).\nNo question is raised as to the validity or effect of these statutes before the Union of Newfoundland with Canada. Newfoundland became part of Canada as a province thereof on, from, and after the coming into force of the Terms of Union between the two countries, which were agreed to between representatives of both and were approved by the Government of Newfoundland, and, by chapter 1 of the Statutes of 1949 of Canada, by the Canadian Parliament, assented to February 18, 1949. As the British North America Act, 1949 (Imperial), confirmed the Terms of Union and enacted that they should have the force of law notwithstanding anything in the British North America Acts, 1867 to' 1946, the terms, by virtue of number 50, came into force immediately before the expiration of March 31, 1949.\nAll of the Newfoundland statutes listed were enacted before the Union of Newfoundland with Canada by the Governor, Legislative Council and House of Assembly of Newfoundland or by the Governor by and with the advice of the Commission of Government. Newfoundland had a Constitution until it was suspended by the Commission of Government referred to, as of February 16, 1934, and by Term 7 of the Terms of Union that Constitution as it existed immediately prior to that date \"is revived at the date of union and shall, subject to these terms and the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1946, continue as the Constitution of the Province of Newfoundland from and after the date of union, until altered under the authority of the said Acts.\"\nBy Term 3:\u2014(See p. 619 supra).\nBy other Terms of Union provision is made for the executive and legislature and such special matters as education, patents, trade marks and fisheries but the important term is 18, the four paragraphs of which read as follows:\u2014(Seep. 619 supra).\nIn pursuance of paragraph (2) of this term the Governor General in Council by a proclamation dated April 1, 1949, brought into force in the province as of that date the Customs Act and the Excise Tax Act of Canada. By another proclamation, of May 9, 1949, the Dominion Income Tax Act was brought into force in the province as of May 16) 1949, the date of the publication of the proclamation in the Canada Gazette. If there were any doubt as to the intention to make applicable the Customs Act, the Excise Tax Act, and The Income Tax Act, of the Dominion, such doubt is removed by the provisions of s. 49 of c. 25 of the 1949 Canadian Statutes (2 Sess.).\nThe questions submitted may be answered by a consideration of paragraphs (1) and (3) of Term 18 when applied to the listed statutes which I assume are part of the \"laws in force in Newfoundland at or immediately prior to the date of union.\" These statutes deal with Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd. or its predecessors, all of which will be hereafter included in the term \"company\". They were concerned with giving effect to and carrying out various agreements between the company and the Government of Newfoundland. The latter was interested in promoting the development of industry in the country and the company was interested in obtaining lands, mineral rights, water rights, timber rights and concessions. It may be stated briefly that the agreements provide:\u2014the stock and shares, and the bonds, debentures, debenture stock, mortgage, and other securities of the company are exempt from taxation for a period of fifty years; the company is to pay the Government for five years in respect of its income, a tax of twenty percentum subject to a maximum; import duties on certain articles are foregone; certain property of the company is exempt from municipal taxation; the Government of Newfoundland and the Treasury in England agree to guarantee certain debentures of the company, which guarantees, we are informed, have been given. On the other hand, the company agrees to establish and maintain certain water-power developments and manufacturing establishments, and we are told that its investment in Newfoundland amounts approximately to eighty-six million dollars.\nThe company admits that the Dominion may require to be taken out a licence, permit, or certificate, as referred to in the questions, but denies that Canada may exact duties or taxes otherwise than as provided by the Newfoundland statutes. Its first argument runs as follows. While it is admitted that paragraphs (1) and (4) of Term 18 correspond generally to s. 129 of the British North America Act, 1867, it is pointed out that the B.N.A. Act, 1949 (Imperial), gave the Terms of Union the force of law notwithstanding anything in the B.N.A. Acts, 1867 to 1946. Hence it follows, it is said, that Term 18 must be taken to contain all the provisions relative to the determination of the points involved in this reference and, to give full effect thereto, the laws of Newfoundland in force at the date of union must be divided into three categories:\u2014\n(a) those which fall clearly within the Dominion field under the B.N.A. Act and are subject to be repealed, abolished or altered by the Federal Parliament; (b) those which fall clearly within the provincial field and are subject to be repealed, abolished or altered by a provincial legislature;\n(c) those not falling within either of the categories (a) or (b) but which are of mixed subject matter and inseverable such as the Bowater's law, which is a law in which matters under Dominion and Provincial control are so interwoven as to constitute an indissoluble mixture of consideration flowing to and from Bowaters as to be inseverable.\nIf any particular law falls within (a) or (b), then either Parliament or the Legislature, as the case may be, is empowered to act but, if, as is contended here, it is within category (c), then paragraph (3) of Term 18 applies and Parliament may repeal it but only with the consent of the Legislature. This paragraph, it will be noticed, does not provide for a mere alteration and the argument cannot prevail since it leaves no room for the application of paragraph (1) of Term 18.\nWhile the questions are general in their terms as to the Acts of the Parliament of Canada, the discussion at Bar centered around The Income Tax Act, the Customs Act, and the Excise Tax Act. As to these, I have no difficulty in answering each of the questions in the negative upon a consideration of paragraph (1) of Term 18, taken in conjunction with paragraph (3) thereof, because those fields are indisputably open to the Dominion under s. 91 of the British North America Act, 1867, and those three Acts were brought into force in Newfoundland by proclamations as provided by paragraph (2). The same result follows with respect to any duty or taxes imposed by an Act of the Parliament of Canada, or any obligation under any such Act imposing any duty or tax, or any such Act requiring a licence, permit, or certificate for the export or import of goods so long as such Act relates to any field allotted to the Dominion. Whatever may have been in the mind of the draftsman, the mere power conferred by paragraph (3) to repeal with the consent of the Newfoundland Legislature cannot cut down the previous power to repeal, abolish and alter, that, in the relevant fields, is conferred by paragraph (1) upon the Parliament of Canada. This conclusion is strengthened by paragraph (4) of Term 27, which appears under the heading \"Tax Agreement\". This term provides for a possible agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Province of Newfoundland for the rental to the former of the income, corporation income, and corporation tax fields, and the succession duties tax field. Paragraph (4) reads:\u2014\n(4) The Government of the Province of Newfoundland shall not by any agreement entered into pursuant to this term be required to impose on any person or corporation taxation repugnant to the provisions of any contract entered into with such person or corporation before the date of the agreement and subsisting at the date of the agreement.\nThe very fact that in connection with such a matter provision is made whereby the Newfoundland Government is not obliged to impose taxes repugnant to a mentioned contract indicates that under Term 18 (1) the power of Parliament is untrammelled when acting within its proper field of activity.\nThe second of the company's arguments starts with the assumption that paragraphs (1) and (4) of Term 18 correspond to s. 129 of the British North America Act, 1867, and then proceeds to rely upon the decision of the judicial committee in Dobie v. Temporalities Board 1, delivered by Lord Watson, as establishing that since the Canadian Parliament could not have entered into all the terms of the various agreements with the company, and since all the terms thereof are so indissolubly mixed, Parliament has no jurisdiction to enact legislation relating to any of the terms. In that case a statute of the old Province of Canada had created a corporation having a corporate existence and rights in Ontario and Quebec, and it was held by the judicial committee that after Confederation it could not be repealed or modified by the Legislature of either Ontario or Quebec or by the joint operation of both but only by the Parliament of the Dominion. An Act of Quebec, which purported to amend the pre-Confederation statute, did not profess to repeal and amend the earlier Act only in so far as its provisions might apply to or be operative within the Province of Quebec and its enactments were apparently not framed with a view to any such limitation. Lord Watson points this out at page 150 and states that the reason for it was obvious and that it was a reason fatal to the validity of the Act. He continues:\u2014\nThe corporation and the corporate trust, the matters to which its provisions relate, are in reality not divisible according to the limits of provincial authority. In every case where an Act applicable to the two provinces of Quebec and Ontario can now be validly repealed by one of them, the result must be to leave the Act in full vigour within the other province. But in the present case the legislation of Quebec must necessarily affect the rights and status of the corporation as previously existing in the province of Ontario, as well as the rights and interests of individual corporators in that province.\nThis extract clearly shows the distinction between that case and the problem presented to us.\nBut the Company points particularly to the following statement by Lord Watson in the same case at page 147 with reference to s. 129 of the British North America Act, 1867:\nThe powers conferred by this section upon the provincial Legislatures of Ontario and Quebec to repeal and alter the statutes of the old Parliament of the province of Canada are made precisely co-extensive with the powers of direct legislation with which these bodies are invested by the other clauses of the Act of 1867. In order therefore to ascertain how far the provincial Legislature of Quebec had power to alter and amend the Act of 1858 incorporating the board for the management of the Temporalities Fund, it becomes necessary to revert to s. 91 and 92 of the British North America Act, which enumerate and define the various matters which are within the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, as well as those in relation to which the Legislatures of the respective provinces have the exclusive right of making laws. If it could be established that, in the absence of all previous legislation on the subject the Legislature of Quebec would have been authorized by s. 92 to pass an Act in terms identical with the 22 Vict. c. 66, then it would follow that the Act of the 22nd Vict. had been validly amended by the 38 Vict. c. 64. On the other hand, if the Legislature of Quebec has not derived such power of enactment from s. 92, the necessary inference is that the legislative authority required in terms of s. 129 to sustain its right to repeal or alter an old law of the Parliament of the province of Canada is in this case wanting, and that the Act 38 Vict. c. 64, was not intra vires of the Legislature by which it was passed.\nFurthermore, the company relies upon the statement of Lord Watson, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in the Distillers and Brewers Case, Attorney General for Ontario v. Attorney General for Canada 2, at page 366, where he says:\u2014\"It appears to their Lordships that neither the Parliament of Canada nor the provincial legislatures have authority to repeal statutes which they could not directly enact. Their Lordships had occasion, in Dobie v. Temporalities Board, supra, to consider the power of repeal competent to the legislature of a province \u2026 The same principle ought, in the opinion of their Lordships, to be applied to the present case.\" But on that reference it was held that in so far as the provincial enactments came into collision with the provisions of the Canada Temperance Act of 1886 they must yield to Dominion legislation. Instead of assisting the company's present argument, the decision is definitely against it.\nHere it is not suggested by the questions that any attempt would be made by Parliament to repeal the Newfoundland statutes but the point involved is whether Parliament may enact legislation relating to subjects assigned to it although such legislation may affect provincial matters. The rule that it may do so is well settled and has been consistently followed and neither the judgment in the Dobie case nor Lord Watson's statements at pages 147 and 150, quoted above, are in conflict with it. I therefore answer each of the questions in the negative.\nTaschereau J., dissenting:\u2014From 1915 to 1947, the Government of Newfoundland enacted several statutes for the purpose of ratifying or modifying various agreements entered into with the Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp and Paper Mills and its predecessors.\nIt is, I think, unnecessary to analyse in detail all these laws and agreements. It will be sufficient to mention that the Government of Newfoundland, for the purpose of developing enterprises in the colony, and creating new industries, made certain concessions and granted privileges to the company, in consideration of which the latter assumed specific and quite onerous obligations.\nThe purpose of this reference is to obtain the opinion of this court, as to whether or not the company is entitled, since Newfoundland has become a Province of Canada, to any deduction, exemption or immunity in respect of any duty or tax imposed by any act of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe company has fulfilled all its obligations, has spent over $85,000,000 and now claims that it is entitled to the exemptions and deductions of income tax, customs and excise duties granted by the agreements entered into with the Government of Newfoundland, and which in view of the statutes enacted, have the force of law. It is of course not contested that income tax, customs and excise duties may be properly imposed by the Dominion Government, but the submission is that by the Terms of Union, the company still enjoys the privileges granted by the Government of Newfoundland, and that it is therefore beyond the powers of the Dominion to deprive the company of the exemptions conferred by the then competent authority.\nThe Attorney-General's of Canada's submission is that Parliament has legislative authority to amend or override laws of Newfoundland that are continued after the union, to the extent that the subject matters of the laws fall within the legislative authority of Parliament, under s. 91 of the British North America Act. This would be expressly reserved to Parliament by Term 18 of the union which continues the laws, subject to the power of Parliament and the Legislature, to amend or override them within their respective spheres.\nSection 18(1) of \"An Act to approve the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada\" and assented to on the 18th of February, 1949, is as follows:\u2014(See p. 619 supra).\nIt will be observed that section 18(1) is substantially similar to section 129 of the British North America Act, dealing with the continuation and repealing of laws. This s. 129 is as follows:\u2014\n129. Except as otherwise provided by this Act, all laws in force in Canada, Nova Scotia, or New Brunswick at the Union, and all Courts of Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction, and all legal commissions, powers, and authorities, and all officers, judicial, administrative, and ministerial, existing therein at the Union, shall continue in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick respectively, as if the Union had not been made; subject nevertheless (except with respect to such as are enacted by or exist under Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain or of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland), to be repealed, abolished, or altered by the Parliament of Canada, or by the Legislature of the respective province, according to the authority of the Parliament or of that Legislature under this Act.\nPursuant to the powers granted to the Dominion under s. 18(2), the Governor General in Council issued a proclamation on April 1, 1949, bringing into force in Newfoundland the Customs Act and the Excise Act, and on May 9, 1949, another proclamation brought into force the Dominion Income Tax Act. Furthermore, in 1949, the Parliament of Canada enacted \"An Act to Amend The Income Tax Act and The Income War Tax Act\" (S. of C, 1949 (2 Sess.) c. 25) and the relevant sections which are 49 and 50, provide as follows:\u2014\n49. For greater certainty it is hereby declared and enacted that, notwithstanding any other law heretofore enacted by a legislative authority other than the Parliament of Canada (including a law of Newfoundland enacted prior to the first day of April nineteen hundred and forty-nine), no person is entitled to (a) any deduction, exemption or immunity from, or any privilege in respect of,\n(i) any duty or tax imposed by an Act of the Parliament of Canada, or\n(ii) any obligation under an Act of the Parliament of Canada imposing any duty or tax, or\n(b) any exemption or immunity from any provision in an Act of the Parliament of Canada requiring a licence, permit or certificate for the export or import of goods, unless provision for such deduction, exemption, immunity or privilege is expressly made by the Parliament of Canada.\n50. Notwithstanding anything contained in this or any other Act an exemption from taxation provided for in an international treaty or international agreement binding on Newfoundland before the union of Newfoundland with Canada may be extended by regulation of the Governor in Council to taxation by or under any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nBefore joining Confederation, Newfoundland had a unitary Government and by virtue of its undivided powers, had full authority to enact laws concerning the various matters found in the agreements with the company. It could competently deal with income tax, customs and excise duties, land and water grants, mining concessions, municipal taxation, matters which under the scheme of Confederation are not attributed to only one authority. The validity of the agreements entered into are therefore unchallengeable.\nHowever, by entering Confederation, Newfoundland renounced its rights to legislate on all subject matters which are under the British North America Act, of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, and its legislative authority was therefore limited to the narrower sphere of s. 92. This limited status created an entirely new situation for Newfoundland, and the question now arises as to which authority has the power to repeal in toto or partially, the statutes which have given force of law to the agreements entered into between the parties.\nThe Terms of Union contemplate the continuation, amendment, or repeal of the laws of Newfoundland, and the enforcement and application in the new province of the laws of Canada. It is unquestionable that all the laws enacted by the former Government of Newfoundland, and dealing with matters enumermated in s. 91 of the B.NA. Act, may be repealed, abolished or altered by the central government, which is, by virtue of the law, vested with the necessary authority to deal with these matters. The case would be an easy one if we had merely to decide that federal income tax, customs and excise duties imposed by the Parliament of Canada, apply to Newfoundland, but the statutes with which we have to deal cover so many different matters, of both provincial and federal competency, and are so linked together that an entirely new situation arises. They cover matters some of which are now within the legislative powers of the Province of Newfoundland.\nUnder the Terms of Union, Newfoundland has obviously a new status, but I cannot agree with the submission of the Attorney General for Canada, that the statutes referred to in the questions submitted, ceased to operate at the time of the Union of Newfoundland with Canada. By the very terms of s. 18, para. (1) of the Act to approve the union, all the laws in force in Newfoundland, at or prior to the date of union, continue as if the union had not been made, subject to be repealed, abolished or altered by the Parliament of Canada or by the Legislature, according to their respective authority under the B.N.A. Act. It follows that these statutes continue to be in force, until repealed by the competent authority.\nIt cannot be contested that agreements of this kind are given a legal effect only because of a statutory approval, and that they cease to have such an effect, with the withdrawal of the approval. (Attorney General for B.C. v. Esquimalt and Nanaimo 3 ). But with respect, I believe that neither the Parliament of Canada, by legislation, nor the Governor General in Council, by proclamation, may withdraw the approval which has been given to the statutes now under consideration. If all the matters covered by the agreements were matters on which the Dominion could competently legislate under s. 91, I would not hesitate to answer the interrogatories in the negative, in view of s. 18(1), because the statutes would then be repealed, abolished or altered by the competent authority. But these statutes do not deal only with matters of federal concern, but also with matters which are now clearly within the exclusive province of the local Legislature. They are so closely interwoven that they form together a complete unity that makes them inseverable. They must be read,] together; they form a group that cannot be altered piecemeal, without affecting fundamentally their \"raison d'\u00eatre\". If so, they would not have any effective operation, as the whole scheme contemplated would be entirely destroyed. They surely would not have been adopted, amputated of all that is now proposed to be repealed. (Attorney General for Alberta v. Attorney General for Canada 4 ).\nIn Dobie v. Temporalities Board 5, the judicial committee discussed s. 129 of the B.N.A. Act, a section which is substantially similar to s. 18(1) of the Terms of Union, and at page 147, their Lordships expressed the following views:\u2014\nThe powers conferred by this section upon the provincial Legislatures of Ontario and Quebec to repeal and alter the statutes of the old Parliament of the Province of Canada are made precisely co-extensive with the powers of direct legislation with which these bodies are invested by the other clauses of the Act of 1867 * * *\nIf it could be established that, in the absence of all previous legislation on the subject the Legislature of Quebec would have been authorized by sect. 92 to pass an Act in terms identical with the 22 Vict. c. 66, then it would follow that the Act of the 22nd Vict. has been validly amended by the 38 Viet. c. 64. On the other hand, if the Legislature of Quebec has not derived such power of enactment from Sect. 92, the necessary inference is that the legislative authority required in terms of sect. 129 to sustain its right to repeal or alter an old law of the Parliament of the Province of Canada is in this case wanting, and that the Act 38 Vict. c. 64, was not intra vires of the Legislature by which it was passed.\nLater, in Attorney General for Ontario v. Attorney General for the Dominion 6, their Lordships said at page 366:\u2014\nIt appears to their Lordships that neither the Parliament of Canada, nor the Provincial Legislatures have authority to repeal Statutes which they could not directly enact.\nApplying these principles to the present case, it would appear that the Dominion cannot legislate in any way to modify these inseverable statutes in such a way that their purpose would be defeated, for the reason that it could not, in view of the divided legislative powers attributed by the B.N.A. Act, directly enact them. If it did so, it would invade a field which is reserved exclusively to the jurisdiction of the Legislature, and consequently, act beyond its constitutional powers.\nUnless very extraordinary conditions happen, the respective legislative authority of the Dominion and of the provinces, is found in ss. 91 and 92 of the B.N.A. Act, and the exclusive powers that belong to each authority cannot be delegated to the other. But there are cases, where serious conflicts would occur if the co-operation of the Dominion and the provinces was not willingly offered, to arrive at a satisfactory solution. (Attorney General for B.C. v. Attorney General for Canada, 7.\nThe present case is, I think, one of these, and it seems to be reasonably clear, that it is with the above pronouncement of the judicial committee in mind, that the framers of the Terms of Union incorporated s. 18(3) in the Act to approve the Terms of Union. It reads as follows:\n18 (3). Notwithstanding anything in these terms, the Parliament of Canada may with the consent of the Legislature of the Province of Newfoundland repeal any law in force in Newfoundland at the date of Union.\nOf course, the consent of the Legislature cannot empower the Dominion to legislate on provincial matters. But the Imperial statute which ratified the Terms of Union vested in the Dominion the necessary authority to do so, after the consent has been obtained legally.\nAt the hearing, the Attorney General for Newfoundland who intervened to support the stand taken by the company, said that this section 18(3) was incorporated in the Act for the very purpose of dealing with cases such as the one which is submitted to this court. The plausibility of this statement cannot be challenged, for it was common knowledge that the former unitary Government of Newfoundland, being then supreme in its legislative powers, had enacted laws which are now of a mixed federal and provincial character, and that they continued in force by the Terms of Union. There being no authority to repeal these inseverable laws, the necessary power was granted by the Imperial Parliament to the Dominion to repeal them, with however the consent of the Legislature of Newfoundland.\nAs this consent has not been obtained, I have come to the conclusion that the Parliament of Canada alone has no power to impose taxation upon the company in contravention of the terms of the agreements which have been ratified by statutes. I would therefore answer the interrogatories as follows:\n1. Yes; the deductions, exemptions, immunities and privileges provided for in the said Statutes of Newfoundland.\n2. No, except in respect of the obligations to pay duties or taxes otherwise than as provided by the said Statutes of Newfoundland.\n3. No, except in so far as the acquisition or possession of any such licence, permit or certificate entails the payment of duties or taxes otherwise than as provided by the said Statutes of Newfoundland.\nRand J.:\u2014The Governor in Council has referred to this court the following questions:\u2014(See p. 609 supra).\nThey arise in the context of a series of instruments executed between 1915 and 1942 between His Majesty represented by the Governor in Council of Newfoundland and the respondent company or its predecessors in title and confirmed in several forms by the legislature of that colony. Those up to and including 1923 were \"approved and confirmed\": amendments in 1927 and 1935 were, in addition, declared to \"have the force of law\" and each party to have \"full power and authority\" to carry out their provisions; and in 1938, \"to have the force and effect of law for all purposes as if expressly enacted herein.\" The legislation effected original modifications, also, both by way of amendment of clauses contained in the instruments and in the form of new provisions.\nThe matter of this convention was a large scale industrial development at Corner Brook, Newfoundland, involving the extensive use of hydro-electric power in the production of fertilizers and allied substances and the manufacture of pulp and paper. The company was granted lands, waters and water powers. The capital investment was to be not less than $20,000,000.\nThe company was to enjoy two concessions which raise the controversy here, one, an exemption, for periods specified, from customs duties or taxes on certain imports and exports; the other, an exemption for 50 years from all other taxes by a statutory clause which at the same time provided for an annual payment based upon a percentage of defined income with a maximum of $150,000 per annum. The provisions governing the former were in part contained in the instruments and in part in legislative amendments or original enactments.\nThroughout the instruments and the legislation there is preserved the conception of a contractual arrangement. Its matter was of a nature that required legislation which, I think, has given statutory fixation to its terms. The grants taken by themselves may or may not have been within the authority of the Crown to make; but the exemptions and certain powers of administrative regulation could be carried out only under legislative authority.\nIt is, to me, indubitable that the colonial Legislature before the union could, of its own motion, and regardless of the assent of the company, have altered the terms with which we are concerned without affecting the validity or force, though not necessarily the interpretation or effect, of those then remaining.\nNewfoundland entered into the federal system of Canada as of the 1st day of April, 1949. The Terms of Union, confirmed by Parliament at Westminster, and the provisions of the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1946, provide the investment and distribution of legislative and executive powers in and between the new province and the Dominion and the answers to the questions depend on the effect of those enactments upon the legislative contract.\nAs has been so often reiterated, throughout the Commonwealth His Majesty maintains a constitutional identity as the sovereign source of executive and legislative power, and in its contractual aspect the arrangement suffered no disruption by reason of the political alteration. In the aspect of legislation, section 18(1) of the Terms of Union declares that:\u2014(Se e p. 619 supra). This, for all purposes here, is identical in effect with s. 129 of the British North America Act. S. 18(3) introduces a further and new provision:\u2014\nNotwithstanding anything in these terms the Parliament of Canada may with the consent of the Legislature of the Province of Newfoundland repeal any law in force in Newfoundland at the date of Union.\nThe legislative result of the union has been to transfer to the field of the Dominion those provisions of law which relate to matters attributed in the constitutional structure to the Dominion; from the moment of union they operate as Dominion laws, subject thereafter to be dealt with under s. 18(1); so, likewise, in the case of the province. Is the exercise of these new jurisdictions restricted by the contractual nature of the arrangement or on the ground that the instruments and the legislation, or the latter alone, constitute a legislative entirety?\nAt the outset, several propositions must be postulated: the totality of legislative power exercisable under the federal constitution must be taken to be vested in the Dominion and province with each, in its own field, sovereign, whether the effective exercise is exclusive or in co-operation, but always as a several exercise; the effect of s. 18(1) of the Terms of Union and s. 129 of the British North America Act is to maintain a continuity not of statutes but of laws, in the sense of distributive provisions which take their place in the one or other jurisdiction according to their subject matter: Dobie v. Temporalities Board, 8; and that modification of the continued laws may be by repeal or amendment or by way of repugnant enactment: Attorney General of Ontario v. Attorney General for the Dominion, 9.\nThere is nothing in the British North America Acts or in the Terms of Union which allocates a legislative contract as a subject matter of jurisdiction. A contract is a convention resting upon and within limits allowed by law. It may deal with matters regulated by laws of either the Dominion or province. Its performance is carried out by acts subject to those laws. But here the provisions dealing with customs duties and taxes are necessarily legislative provisions which only the state could undertake; and as the legislature cannot bind its future action, they remain subject to the contingency of that action.\nWhat in substance is urged by the company is that the Crown, exercising both executive and legislative capacities, has entered into a legislative bargain which, as an entirety, must be brought within a single jurisdiction as a legislative subject matter. Before the union, the Crown as executive and in legislature possessed totality of power. The union effected a division of jurisdiction in laws applicable to the several items of the contract, from which it followed that the source of law now necessary to the contract as a whole is seen to be in both Parliament and Legislature. The action of these bodies, then, not several but joint as by one legislative organ, upon the total subject matter, is the only means by which the terms can be altered. Consistently with this, the Crown as executive would now have two sets of advisers acting jointly and each interested in the whole. So conceived, the act of each body requires as a condition of its legislative efficacy the identical act of the other; the contract has become the subject matter of simultaneous and conditional legislative jurisdiction of Canada plus Newfoundland. This is, of course, to be distinguished from an aggregate of several power, each jurisdiction acting with full efficacy ab initio. Such a conception is novel in the history of federal constitutionalism, and I am unable to find anything in the constitutional enactments that gives the slightest countenance to it.\nAdmittedly the provisions are not severable as terms of a contract, but they are clearly so as legislative subject matters. If it were otherwise, the province could not now by itself authorize the slightest change in the conditions of any licence or local matter involved without the executive and legislative concurrence of the Dominion: nor could the Dominion modify even beneficiently to the company the customs or tax concessions and maintain them within the integrity of the legislation. Such results would, I think, be absurd. It attributes to Parliament and Legislature a joint jurisdiction exceeding their several aggregate. It, in fact, remits the arrangement to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Imperial Parliament. S. 18(3) of the Terms of Union permits only a repeal of any law. This contrasts repeal with repugnancy but it is a cumulative power and cannot be taken to derogate from the jurisdiction of Parliament under 18(1). The consequence of an inability to repeal, in its strict sense, would be the persistence of the colonial statute to which future legislation would be related as the underlying law: s. 18(3) enables that state of things to be eliminated.\nBut the contractual effect or the internal relations of legislation are not determinative of jurisdiction under the Act of 1867: it is the matters with which it deals. So far as the contract needs legislative sustenance, it is dependent on appropriate statutory action. There might, of course, be matter which could be dealt with affirmatively under union only by aggregate action. If, for instance, there had been a railway belonging to the company which connected with that of the provincial government now by the Terms of the Union passed to the Dominion, and between the two lines a statutory tariff of joint rates had been in force, then under the ruling in Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway 10, the legislative authority to bring about such a rate would be in both legislatures acting concurrently, although they could not by such action repeal the colonial law; but it could not be doubted that in such a case either legislature, exercising its own jurisdiction, could frustrate the colonial law by repugnant law, each operative independently from the time of its enactment. But that character of legislative action is denied for the situation here. If it were not available, there would be a lacuna in jurisdiction which we have long since excluded from our constitutional endowment.\nThe case of Dobie v. Temporalities Board, supra, was strongly urged as governing the issues here. In that case, the Legislature of Quebec had repealed a statute of the Province of Canada, continued in force after the union by s. 129, which had this peculiarity, that its provisions applied both to Quebec and to Ontario, and were incapable of being severed so as to make them applicable to one of these provinces only. It was argued that the matter applicable to two provinces was analogous to matter distributed between two jurisdictions which here, as in that case, was not severable. I think the analogy fails on both grounds. The statutory incorporation was obviously of a nature beyond the competence of either province to enact or to repeal: and the exemptions from customs duties and Dominion taxation are for legislative purposes as severable as if they were contained in another statute. It is only when we consider them in a contractual or an internal dependency aspect that any such question arises. Any effect upon the remaining terms of the arrangement is an incidental consequence of the exercise of a paramount legislative jurisdiction. Results of this nature may frustrate the original object, but that is a question for Parliament; with it, the courts have nothing to do.\nMr. Carson urged the ordinary rule of severability as the test of Dominion jurisdiction, but I cannot see its relevancy. The question is not whether we can conclude that the colonial legislature would have enacted the legislation with the clauses relating to duties and taxes omitted; I assume it would not; the question is the wholly different one of its jurisdiction to repeal those clauses once enacted while maintaining the remainder of the legislation; and if the colonial legislature, as I think, could have done so, as certainly the Imperial Parliament could have done, then the Canadian Parliament, exercising its jurisdiction over the same matters, may do so even if its power is confined to these items and that of the colonial legislature was not.\nOn April 1, 1949 the Customs Act and on May 9, 1949, The Income Tax Act, were brought into force in Newfoundland by proclamation under s. 18(2) of the Terms of Union.\nBy chapter 25 of the Statutes of Canada 1949 (2 Sess.) the following amendment to the Income Tax Act was enacted:\u2014(See p. 618 supra).\nThe effect of this amendment, the general application of which was not disputed, is to override any provision of the legislative arrangement before us with which the statutes mentioned conflict.\nI would, therefore, answer the questions as follows:\n1. No.\n2. No.\n3. No. Kellock J.:\u2014It is not necessary to restate the questions referred to this court. The essential question throughout is as to whether or not the respondent company may claim exemption from the provisions of certain federal legislation, namely, the Income War Tax Act, the Customs Act and the Excise Act, by reason of anything contained in certain statutes of Newfoundland enacted prior to union. The last two mentioned statutes were proclaimed to be in force in the new province as of April 1, 1949, pursuant to subsection (2) of Term 18 of the Terms of Union, and the first named was similarly proclaimed as of the 16th of May following.\nBy subsection (1) of Term 18 it is provided that, subject to the terms, all \"laws\" in force in Newfoundland at or immediately prior to union shall continue therein, subject to be \"repealed, abolished, or altered\" by Parliament or the provincial legislature according to the authority of each under the British North America Act, 1867 to 1946.\nBy subsection (2), already referred to, it is provided that \"statutes\" of the Parliament of Canada in force at the date of union, or any part thereof, shall come into force in the new province on a day or days to be fixed by Act of Parliament or by proclamation of the Governor General in Council. Subsequent to the proclamations with respect to the three statutes already referred to, Parliament by 13 George VI, c. 25, s. 49, enacted as follows:\n(See p. 618 supra).\nRespondent contends in the first place that nothing in the Canadian legislation affects its position under the pre-union legislation of Newfoundland. It is said that, since the pre-union legislation includes subject matters which are now apportioned for legislative purposes between Parliament and the provincial legislature by sections 91 and 92 of the British North America Act, and since neither legislature can validly legislate with respect to these entire matters, neither can, of itself, \"repeal, abolish or alter\" such legislation. In support of this argument, reliance is placed upon the judgments of the Privy Council in Dobie v. The Temporalities Board 11, and Attorney General for Ontario v. Attorney General for the Dominion (the Local Prohibition case) 12. In the second place, it is said that the only means by which the pre-union legislation can be effectively dealt with is by joint action of the two legislatures under subsection (3) of Term 18.\nWith respect to this last mentioned argument, I am of opinion that subsection (3) in no way limits the operation of subsections (1) and (2). It is expressly limited to \"repeal\" and, in any event in my view, merely provides one means by which repeal of any pre-union \"law\" may be effected.\nAs to the first argument, it was held in Dobie's case that a pre-Confederation statute of Canada which created a corporation having its corporate existence and rights in what subsequently became the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, could not be repealed by the legislature of either province, or by the joint operation of both, but only by the Parliament of the Dominion, it being there laid down that the power of a provincial legislature to alter, or amend, a pre-Confederation statute is precisely co-extensive with its power to enact identical legislation.\nIn the Local Prohibition case, Lord Watson, in delivering the judgment of the Board, said at page 366:\nBut the Dominion Parliament has no authority conferred upon it by the Act to repeal directly any provincial statute, whether it does or does not come within the limits of jurisdiction prescribed by s. 92. The repeal of a provincial Act by the Parliament of Canada can only be effected by repugnancy between its provisions and the enactments of the Dominion * * * It appears to their Lordships that neither the Parliament of Canada nor the provincial legislatures have authority to repeal statutes which they could not directly enact.\nThe board held in that case that The Canada Temperance Act of 1886, insofar as it purported expressly to repeal the prohibitory clauses of the pre-Confederation statute of 1864, was invalid. That statute was purely local in its nature and as Parliament could not enact legislation of that character, neither could it repeal it. It will be seen that in both these cases what the board was concerned with was the power of repeal of statutes or sections of statutes in their entirety and that the subject matters of the same were outside the legislative jurisdiction of Parliament under section 91. Even in the Dobie case, at page 150 Lord Watson bad said:\nIf, by a single Act of the Dominion Parliament, there had been constituted two separate corporations, for the purpose of working, the one a mine within the province of Upper Canada, and the other a mine in the province of Lower Canada, the Legislature of Quebec would clearly have had authority to repeal the Act so far as it related to the latter mine and the corporation by which it was worked.\nIn Bonanza Creek v. The King 13, Viscount Haldane, in the course of his judgment, said with reference to another pre-Confederation statute of 1864, at page 583:\nIt was obviously beyond the powers of the Ontario Legislature to repeal the provisions of the Act of 1864, excepting insofar as the British North America Act enabled it to do this in matters relating to the province.\nIn Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General for Quebec14, (the Fisheries case), the Judicial Committee had to deal with the respective powers of the Dominion and the provinces to legislate with respect to fisheries. In this case their Lordships referred to their earlier decision in 1898 A.C., page 700, which had dealt with legislation affecting the same subject matter. By a pre-Confederation statute of 1865 the legislature of Canada provided for the amendment of the law relating to fishing and fisheries, and this statute applied to the whole of Upper and Lower Canada. Section 3 authorized the Commissioner of Crown lands to issue fishing leases and licences while other sections of the statute dealt with the management and regulation of fisheries, the obstruction and pollution of streams, and deep sea fishing. After Confederation, in 1868, the Dominion Parliament, by 31 Vic. c. 60, repealed the Act of 1865 (s. 20) and in addition enacted a number of provisions in many respects resembling those of the Act of 1865. The substance of this last mentioned Act was subsequently incorporated into c. 95 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1886. S. 4 of this statute was in the terms of the former corresponding sections of 1868 and 1865, save that the Minister of Marine and Fisheries was substituted for the Commissioner of Crown Lands. Their Lordships point out that the board in 1898 had held that the Dominion had no power to enact s. 4, as it dealt with a matter committed exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces and that this decision must be taken to be settled law. There is no suggestion in the decision of 1898, nor in that of 1921, that because of the inclusion of the provision in s. 2 as to leases and licences, with respect to which the Dominion could not validly legislate, the repeal of the legislation of 1865 by s. 20 was invalid also. On the contrary, Viscount Haldane, at page 426, pointed out that by reason of s. 20 of the Act of 1868, the Act of 1865 had been in force for only three years and that\nSection 91 of the British North America Act, 1867, had conferred on the Dominion Parliament exclusive authority to legislate in regard to sea coast and inland fisheries, and it was under this authority that the repeal was effected.\nAt page 430.the following occurs:\nAs to s. 3 of the Act of 1865 * * * this was obviously within the competence of the Legislature which was then unrestricted in the scope of its power to alter the provincial law. No distinction was, or needed to be, contemplated between power of regulation and power over proprietary title. Bearing this in mind, their Lordships think that s. 3 was in its character as much a regulative provision as it was one directed to property. These two aspects of its subject matter were really then inseparable. In so far as its powers were powers of regulation, they have passed to the Dominion Parliament.\nThere was no discussion as to whether, because of the fact that the subject matter of s. 3 of the Act of 1865 had become vested for legislative purposes in two different legislatures, the repeal in 1868 was ineffective as to that section. Perhaps, consistently with the earlier decisions that should have been the result, but the point was not in issue.\nI therefore think that what was said by Lord Watson in 1896 A.C., at page 366, in the passage already cited is limited to that which was before the board in that case, namely, the repeal as a whole of a statute or certain specific parts. If Parliament cannot enact, it cannot repeal, no matter whether the attempted mode is by express repeal or by the enactment of repugnant legislation.\nFor neither the Parliament of Canada nor the provincial legislatures have authority under the Act to nullify, by implication any more than expressly, statutes which they could not enact;\nPer Viscount Haldane in the Great West Saddlery case, 15.\nHowever, where, as in the case at bar, pre-Confederation, or pre-union legislation covers matters as to which there has since obtained a division of legislative jurisdiction by reason of sections 91 and 92 the respective legislatures may deal with the matters competent to each and thereby affect the position formerly existing under the legislation enacted prior to such division. In the present case there is no \"express\" repeal but in my opinion the three Dominion statutes under consideration do now effectively \"alter\" and: \"abolish\" the privileged position to which the respondent was entitled under the legislation of Newfoundland prior to 1949.\nThe word \"laws\" in Term 18 is not synonomous with \"statutes\", as it is clear from subsection (2) that when the one or the other was intended, the proper term was employed. Accordingly, any law, statutory or non-statutory, may, by the express terms of subsection (1), be dealt with by the legislature competent to deal with the subject matter. There is no question but that Parliament has exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the subject matters of legislation embodied in the three statutes in question. If the pre-union Newfoundland statutes are to be considered as continuing in force after the proclamation of the Dominion statutes, on the theory that the Newfoundland acts are special legislation and, therefore, constitute an exemption from the terms of the general Acts, s. 49 of the 1949 Act, already quoted, is effective to abolish the position obtaining under the special legislation.\nThe decision in this court In re New Brunswick Penitentiary 16, is in harmony with the view just expressed. In that case certain questions were referred to the court by the Governor General in Council with regard to the power of Parliament to legislate as to persons to be confined in the New Brunswick Penitentiary. That penitentiary had been constituted, and provision made, for the class of persons to be confined therein, by pre-Confederation legislation. Subsequent to 1867 Parliament passed legislation providing for a joint penitentiary for the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, and delineating the class of persons to be confined therein. On a question raised by the Government of New Brunswick as to the power of Parliament to so legislate, it was held that under s. 91 Parliament had power to so enact, and that that power was in no way limited, restricted, or affected by any legislation of the province either prior or subsequent to Confederation.\nWhile the exemptions here in question originated by way of contract, they required for their efficacy the inter- vention of the legislature and, as already pointed out, with respect to the matters with which we are here concerned, legislative jurisdiction passed upon, union to Parliament. There is no ground, in my opinion, upon which it can be said that Parliament is restrained from legislating as it sees fit with regard to such subject matter.\nThe questions should, therefore, be answered in the negative.\nEstey J.:\u2014The Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp and Paper Mills, Ltd., by virtue of a series of agreements concluded with the Government of Newfoundland from 1915 to 1947 assumed obligations and obtained exemptions from certain taxes and customs duties, and in this reference it claims that these exemptions were continued under the Terms of Union between the Dominion of Canada and Newfoundland.\nThe said agreements were all confirmed by statutes and such as were in force at the date of the Union were continued by virtue of para. 18(1) of the Terms of Union and are hereinafter referred to as \"Bowater's law.\"\nWe are in this reference in the main concerned with the provisions of the 1927 and 1938 agreements under which it was provided that Bowater's Company \"in respect of its income for each year\" should pay a tax between the years 1932 and 1973 not to exceed the sum of $150,000 per year; that apart from an exemption not material hereto, upon payment of that tax \"the company shall be exempt from all taxation of every kind whatsoever other than duties (including sales tax) levied under the general laws of the colony on goods imported by the company and not otherwise exempt.\" These words \"not otherwise exempt\" refer to provisions under the agreements whereby Bowaters were granted exemptions from customs duties, completely or partially, upon specified commodities for varying periods.\nUnder the authority of 18(2) of the Terms of Union (hereinafter quoted) the Governor General in Council proclaimed as of April 1, 1949, the Customs Act, the Tariff Act and other named statutes, and by a further proclamation of May. 9, 1949, the Income War Tax Act and other named statutes were brought into force as of May 16, 1949, in the province of Newfoundland and certain pre-union statutes of Newfoundland were specifically repealed by each of these proclamations. Bowater's law was not included as it did not come within the terms of 18(2) (a), (b) and (c) and therefore could not be dealt with by proclamation. These provisions of 18(2) (a), (b) and (c), however, do not apply to statutes enacted by the Parliament of Canada.\nLater in 1949 the Parliament of Canada amended the Income War Tax Act and these amendments came into force December 10, 1949, (S. of C, 1949, 2nd Sess., c. 25). The amendments relative to this discussion are sees. 49 and 50: (See p. 618 supra).\nThe amendments in s. 49 are intended to repeal pro tanto Bowater's law and as a consequence the three questions under consideration were submitted to this court. The answers thereto are dependent upon the meaning and effect of the Terms of Union.\nThe procedure contemplated by s. 146 of the B.N.A. Act for the admission of Newfoundland into Confederation was not followed as at all times material to negotiation and conclusion of the Terms of Union Newfoundland was governed by a Commission. The Terms of Union were negotiated and signed by representatives of both Newfoundland and the Dominion of Canada and were made a schedule to legislation approving it in Canada (S. of C. 1949, c. 1), and Great Britain (12 & 13 Geo. VI, c. 22). This approval gives to every clause of the agreement statutory validity: Manchester Ship Canal Co. v. Manchester Racecourse Co. 17, 31 Hals., 2nd ed., p. 465, paras 569 and 571; International Rly. Co. v. Niagara Parks Comm. (2)18.\nThe Terms of Union contain the following paragraph: (Here follows Term 3 for which see p. 619 supra).\nThen under the general heading \"Continuation of Laws\" para. 18 reads as follows: (See p. 618 supra).\nOn behalf of the Dominion it is pointed out that sub-paras. (1) and (4) of para. 18 are in effect identical with the relevant portions of s. 129 of the B.N.A. Act and are enacted in respect of all laws in force in Newfoundland at the time of the union. Further, that sub-para. 18(1) continues Bowater's law in force and provides for its repeal, abolition or alteration; that s. 49 of the Income War Tax Act (S. of C. 1949, 2nd Sess., c. 25, s. 49 and 50) is competent Dominion legislation which specifically refers to a law enacted prior to April 1, 1949, in Newfoundland and goes on to provide that no person is entitled to any deductions, exemption, immunity from or any privilege in respect of Dominion duties or taxes as therein specified.\nOn behalf of Bowaters it is contended that when para. 18 in the Terms of Union is read and construed as a unit that the meaning and purpose of sub-para. 18(3) can only be given effect to if the pre-union laws of Newfoundland are divided into three categories:\n(a) those which fall clearly within the Dominion field under the B.N.A. Act and are subject to be repealed, abolished or altered by the Federal Parliament;\n(b) those which fall clearly within the provincial field and are subject to be repealed, abolished or altered by a provincial Legislature;\n(c) those not falling within either of the categories (a) or (b) but which are of mixed subject matter and inseverable such as the Bowater's law, which is a law in which matters under Dominion and provincial control are so interwoven as to constitute an indissoluble mixture of consideration flowing to and from Bowaters as to be inseverable.\nCounsel for Bowaters submits that laws classified within the foregoing paras, (a) and (b) are dealt with under sub-para. 18(1) and those within (c) under sub-para. 18(3); further, that Bowater's law is of \"mixed subject-matter,\" in its nature \"indivisible or incapable of severance\" and as such is classified under para, (c) and therefore dealt with only under sub-para. 18(3). It is further contended that in any event the enactment of the above quoted s. 49 did not repeal any part of Bowater's law.\nIt was submitted that inasmuch as the statute in Great Britain confirming the Terms of Union provided \"The agreement containing Terms of Union between Canada and Newfoundland * * * shall have the force of law notwithstanding anything in the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1946,\" that in the construction of the Terms of Union no regard should be had to the provisions of the B.N.A. Acts, 1867 to 1946. The Canadian statute approving the agreement did not include any such provision. These differences in the respective enactments, the express provisions of para. 3 that the B.N.A. Acts, 1867 to 1946, \"shall apply to the Province of Newfoundland * * * except in so far as varied by these terms,\" the repeated references to the B.N.A. Act in the Terms of Union, together with the fact that Newfoundland could not in the circumstances be admitted as contemplated by s. 146 of the B.N.A. Act, suggest that the words in the above mentioned British statute were inserted to remove any question that might arise out of the procedure followed not being that provided for in s. 146 rather than that in the construction of the Terms of Union no regard should be had to any provisions of the B.N.A. Act, 1867 to 1946.\nThe B.N.A. Act divides the entire legislative field between the Parliament of Canada and the legislatures of the provinces, or as it is stated by Lord Hobhouse:\n* * * an Act of Parliament which makes an elaborate distribution of the whole field of legislative authority between two legislative bodies * * * Bank of Toronto v. Lambe 19.\nSee also A.-G. for Ontario v. A.-G. for Canada 20.\nThe B.N.A. Act therefore defines the legislative power and authority of the Dominion and the Provinces to enact legislation. It has, however, been determined that the power to repeal is co-extensive with that to enact. Dobie v. Temporalities Board 21; A.-G. for Ontario v. A.-G. for Dominion 22.\nThe respective jurisdictions of the Dominion and the Province in respect to pre-Confederation legislation was considered by the Privy Council in A.-G. for Canada v. A.-G. for Quebec 23. The particular legislation there in question was enacted in 1865, (29 Vict., c. 11), and therefore prior to Confederation, by the Parliament of Upper and Lower Canada. After Confederation the Parliament of Canada by s. 20 of the Fisheries Act (S. of C. 1868, c. 60) repealed the legislation of 1865. It did not, however, follow that all of the powers exercised by Lower Canada became thereby vested in the Dominion. Referring particularly to s. 3 of the pre-Confederation Act of 1865 their Lordships stated:\nAs to s. 3 of the Act of 1865, which enables the Commissioner of Crown Lands, where the exclusive right of fishing does not exist by law in favour of private persons, to issue fishing leases and licenses for fisheries and fishing wherever carried on, this was obviously within the competence of the Legislature which was then unrestricted in the scope of its power to alter the provincial law. No distinction was, or needed to be, contemplated between power of regulation and power over proprietary title. Bearing this in mind, their Lordships think that s. 3 was in its character as much a regulative provision as it was one directed to property. These two aspects of its subject matter were really then inseparable. In so far as its powers were powers of regulation, they have passed to the Dominion Parliament * * * the disposal of property and the exercise of the power of regulation. The former of these functions has now fallen to the province, but the latter to the Dominion; and accordingly the power which existed under s. 3 of the Act of 1865 no longer exists in its entirety.\nThis illustrates how completely the field of legislation is divided between the Dominion and the province and the necessity of careful examination of the statute and of the individual sections thereof in order to determine whether a particular provision should be classified as within the Dominion or provincial legislative field within the meaning of the B.N.A. Act.\nIn re New Brunswick Penitentiaries 24, this court held that legislation enacted relative to penitentiaries by the Parliament of Canada superseded legislation passed by New Brunswick prior to Confederation and continued in force in that province after Confederation by virtue of s. 129 of the B.N.A. Act.\nThe foregoing decisions were made under the B.N.A. Act of 1867 and indicate how pre-Confederation legislation has been treated.\nIt is not contended that the legislative division set forth in the foregoing paras, (a), (b) and (c) exists under s. 129 of the B.N.A. Act, s. 16 of the Alberta and Saskatchewan Acts, or under any of the express terms to be found in the admission of any other province. It would seem, therefore, that if in the Terms of Union it was intended to introduce such a classification and to effect so radical a change in the construction of 18(1) by the inclusion of 18(3), appropriate language would have been used to express that intention in either one or both of sub-paras. (1) and (3); on the contrary, 18(1) is expressed in clear and comprehensive language without any exception or limitation and no such division is suggested in either that sub-para, or sub-para. (3).\nMoreover, the acceptance of this submission on behalf of Bowaters would impose a limitation upon the Parliament of Canada to the extent that competently enacted legislation so far as it would be contrary to the pre-Confederation Bowater's law could have no application to that company until such time as Newfoundland would give its consent to the repeal of Bowater's law. In effect the exemptions from taxation and payment of certain customs duties provided for in Bowater's law would remain until such time as Newfoundland permits the Parliament of Canada to legislate in regard thereto. No similar provision was embodied in the Terms of Union of any other province, and while that is not at all conclusive, it is significant in this sense, that a provision so important, far reaching and contrary to the general scheme of legislative jurisdiction under the B.N.A. Act would have been expressed in language clear and unambiguous. Sub-para. 3 contains no such language. Indeed, its language as ordinarily construed does not suggest that the legislative authority of either the Dominion or the province is interfered with.\nThe opening words of sub-para. 18(3) \"notwithstanding anything in these terms,\" together with its express provision that it applies to \"any law in force at the date of the union\" indicates that its provisions are by way of an exception to the general provisions of the Terms of Union rather than as submitted a provision to deal with a third (para (c) supra) classification of legislation. The language of 18(1) is general and all embracing: That of 18(3) provides that notwithstanding all that has been provided \"the Parliament of Canada may with the consent of the Legislature of the Province of Newfoundland repeal any law.\" These sub-paras. 18(1) and (3) when read and construed together do not support a construction that they are dealing with separate and distinct portions of a general classification of legislation such as submitted by Bowaters in paras. (a), (b) and (c). Bowater's law is not mentioned in sub-para. 18(3) nor in any other section throughout the Terms of Union. The absence of any specific reference to this law or any group or type of laws in which it might be included rather suggests that the classification of legislation such as here submitted was not intended but rather that all legislation should be subject to the provisions of 18(1).\nIt may be implicit in the submission for Bowater's that neither the Dominion nor the Province of Newfoundland can legislate with respect to Bowater's law until such time as the province shall consent to its repeal by the Parliament of Canada under sub-para. 18(3). The difficulty is to find language to support such a view. Whatever opinion one may entertain of the submission with respect to the suggested construction of sub-para. 18(3) in its application to the Dominion it does not contain language that suggests any such limitation upon provincial enactments. It would therefore appear that the province might repeal, abolish or alter any part of Bowater's law classified within provincial jurisdiction. Para. 24 of the 1938 Bowater's law that \"all property of the company within the area of any towns or settlements established by the company shall be exempt from municipal taxation\" is such a provision. If it was intended that the province in respect of Bowater's should not possess the power to legislate within its jurisdiction, again appropriate language to that effect would have been included. Its omission rather supports the view that it was intended both the representatives in Parliament and the Legislature would legislate in their respective fields without any limitation such as that involved in the submission on behalf of Bowater's.\nCounsel for Bowater's further contends that if Bowater's law comes within the provisions of sub-para. 18(1) the Parliament of Canada cannot repeal that law as it has purported to do by the enactment of s. 49 of the Income War Tax Act, supra. It is here contended that Bowater's law is indivisible or incapable of severance and therefore its provisions cannot be divided between the Dominion and the province as contemplated by the B.N.A. Act and cannot be repealed, abolished or altered by the Parliament of Canada. This impossibility, as I understand it, is not because the provisions of Bowater's law cannot be allocated to the respective Dominion and provincial legislative jurisdictions but rather that the subject-matters of that legislation are so \"inextricably interwoven into what constitutes a single Newfoundland law\" that it \"must be regarded as comprising the terms of a single contract which has been confirmed and given the force of law by legislation,\" that to do so in effect destroys it or makes it something entirely different. It is not contended that Newfoundland prior to union had not the jurisdiction to repeal the whole or any part of Bowater's law, but though the legislative jurisdiction of Newfoundland was under the Terms of Union completely divided between the Parliament of Canada and the legislature of the province, neither acting independently can now repeal Bowater's law.\nBowater's law, as already stated, is pre-union legislation enacted by a political entity that no longer exists and is carried forward as legislation in force in the Province of Newfoundland by virtue of sub-para. 18(1) of the Terms of Union. Under the B.N.A. Act the entire legislative field is divided between the Dominion and the province. Bank of Toronto v. Lambe, supra, or as stated by Earl Loreburn, L.C.:\n* * * the powers distributed between the Dominion on the one hand and the provinces on the other hand cover the whole area of self-government within the whole area of Canada. A.-G. for Ontario v. A.-G. for Canada, supra, at p. 581.\nThe Terms of Union under sub-para. 18(1) provide that all pre-union legislation continued in force in the Province of Newfoundland shall be divided as provided in the B.N.A. Act. Under this provision Bowater's law is subject \"to be repealed, abolished or altered by the Parliament of Canada or the Legislature of the Province of Newfoundland\" legislating within their respective jurisdictions as defined under the B.N.A. Act, 1867 to 1946. In fact, the provisions in respect to customs, excise and income legislation here in question are clearly within the legislative jurisdiction of the Parlament of Canada.\nThe principle applied in the Dobie case, supra, that the power to repeal is co-extensive with the power to enact is applicable to Bowater's law. It, however, applies once the respective jurisdictions of the Dominion and the province are determined but does not assist in the determination thereof. It does not suggest that because the statute cannot be entirely repealed by either the Dominion or a province that either cannot repeal or amend that portion of the statute which is within its legislative jurisdiction. The fact that such legislative action on the part of one or the other may create difficulties to be subsequently dealt with does not affect the question of jurisdiction. Whatever such difficulties may be will no doubt in due course be dealt with by the appropriate authorities, but those are not matters to be dealt with by the courts, particularly when as here, this court is called upon to determine only the question of jurisdiction. Under the scheme of Confederation and under the Terms of Union even if the \"rights and obligations are inextricably interwoven into a single Newfoundland law\" as here contended, that would not alter or affect the legislative classification of the various portions of Bowater's law nor the jurisdiction of either the Dominion or the province to deal therewith.\nThe contention that the provisions of Bowater's agreement are not severable as that term has been used in regard to contracts found to contain provisions in restraint of trade or statutes in part ultra vires of the enacting body are not relevant to this discussion. In those cases when a portion of the contract or statute has been declared invalid the question arises as to the disposition of the remaining portion. Hals. 2nd ed., vol. 32, p. 439; A.-G. for Alberta v. A.-G. for Canada 25. Here Bowater's law as confirmed by statute is entirely valid and the issue quite different. We are here first concerned with the law as a whole and then with the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada to repeal a portion thereof.\nThe jurisdiction of Parliament to enact legislation must be determined from the nature and character of the legislation. Any statement or declaration contained therein on the part of Parliament as to its jurisdiction is not conclusive. Once, however, the jurisdiction to enact the legislation is found to exist, the language thereof must be examined to determine the meaning and intent of Parliament in enacting the same. The language of s. 49, supra, while it makes no specific reference to Bowater's law, is designed to and does cover just such provisions as contained in that law. It expressly covers any such legislation in all of the provinces and specifically covers such pre-union legislation in Newfoundland. The contention that sub-para. 18(1) should be construed to apply only to repeal, abolition or alteration when the statute specifically so states would impose an unwarranted limitation upon the comprehensive language there used.\nThe foregoing finds support in the principle that one parliament cannot bind its successors.\nThat parliaments have more than once intended and endeavoured to pass Acts which should tie the hands of their successors is certain, but the endeavour has always ended in failure. Dicey, Law of the Constitution, 9th ed., p. 65.\nIf it were not for this principle a parliament finding itself bound by the legislation of its predecessors would be unable to discharge that imperative duty which rests upon every parliament to legislate as in its wisdom it may determine to be necessary or desirable.\nThe enactment of the foregoing s. 49 of the Income War Tax Act was legislation competently enacted by the Parliament of Canada and enforcible as regards the Bowater's Company, notwithstanding the provisions of the Bowater's law.\nThe questions here submitted should be answered:\n(1) No.\n(2) No.\n(3) No.\nLocke J.:\u2014At the date of the entry of Newfoundland into Confederation Bowater's Newfoundland Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd. was subject to the obligations imposed and entitled to the benefit of certain rights and exemptions granted by a series of agreements entered into by it and its predecessors in title with the Dominion of Newfoundland, and by a series of statutes by which they were confirmed. The company carries on very extensive operations in the manufacture of newsprint and sulphite pulp and other allied activities at Cornerbrook and elsewhere in Newfoundland and has extensive timber limits in the province. The agreements were made and the statutes which approved and confirmed them and gave to their terms the force of law were enacted at various times between the years 1915 and 1946 and dealt with a variety of matters, all of which were then within the legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion. Pursuant to and relying upon these agreements, the company and its predecessors have invested in Newfoundland some $86,000,000 in the construction and equipping of manufacturing plants, the establishment of towns and settlements, the development of water power, the acquisition of timber limits, and in other works and plant necessary for the carrying on of its activities. In consideration of the undertaking of these extensive developments which, it is evident, were regarded as being of importance and benefit to the state, and the assumption of various obligations of a continuing character including an agreement to pay to the Dominion in respect of its income for each year beginning with the year 1928 and ending with the year 1973 a tax of twenty per cent of its income, limited to a maximum of $75,000 for the years 1928 to 1931 inclusive and $150,000 for each of the years 1932 to 1973 inclusive, the Dominion of Newfoundland by the said agreements and by the various statutes undertook, inter alia, that the stocks, shares, bonds, debentures and other securities of the company and the dividends or interest payable in respect of them and the receipt of the same by holders domiciled in Newfoundland (with certain named exceptions) should be exempt from taxation until the year 1977, that certain described goods and commodities imported by the company should be free of customs duties and others subjected to duties limited in amount, and that all its property within the area of towns and settlements established by it should be exempt from municipal taxation.\nBy s. 146 of the British North America Act, 1867, provision was made for the admission of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island and British Columbia into the union on addresses from the Houses of Parliament of Canada and of the respective legislatures of what were referred to as the Colonies or Provinces \"on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the addresses expressed and as the Queen thinks fit to approve, subject to the provisions of this Act; and the provisions of any Order-in-Council in that behalf shall have effect as if they had been enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\" In the case of the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, the union of which was effected by the Act, s. 129 provided that all laws in force in these provinces at the time of union:\u2014\nshall continue in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick respectively as if the Union had not been made; subject nevertheless (except with respect to such as are enacted by or exist under Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain or of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland) to be repealed, abolished or altered by the Parliament of Canada or by the Legislature of the respective Province according to the authority of the Parliament or of that Legislature under this Act.\nWhen Newfoundland sought to enter the union it had no legislature, the power to enact laws having since the coming into operation of letters patent granted by His Majesty on January 30, 1934, been vested in the Governor and the Commission of Government which it authorized. In these circumstances, the union was brought about by amendment to the British North America Act passed in 1949 which, by section 1, provided that:\u2014\nThe agreement containing terms of Union between Canada and Newfoundland set out in the schedule to this Act is hereby confirmed and shall have the force of law notwithstanding anything in the British North America Acts 1867 to 1946.\nSection 3 of the Terms of Union provides that the British North America Acts 1867 to 1946 shall apply to the new province in the same way and to the like extent as they apply to the provinces heretofore comprised in Canada \"except in so far as varied by these terms and except such provisions as are in terms made or, by reasonable intendment, may be held to be specially applicable to or only to affect one or more and not all of the provinces originally united.\"\nSubsections 1 and 4 of s. 18 of the Terms of Union repeat in substance s. 129 of the Act of 1867, with the substitution of Newfoundland for the names of the former provinces which then entered the union. Section 18 contained, however, the following further provisions governing the alterations of the laws of the new province which are not to be found in the British North America Act, or in any of its amendments made prior to March 31, 1949, or in the Terms of Union under which British Columbia and Prince Edward Island entered Confederation, or the statutes which established the Provinces of Manitoba, Alberta or Saskatchewan. These provisions read:\u2014(See Term 18(2) at p.\u2014? supra).\nBy an amendment to The Income Tax Act and Income War Tax Act (s. 49, c. 25, 13 Geo. VI), it was provided that notwithstanding any other law heretofore enacted by a legislative authority other than the Parliament of Canada, including a law of Newfoundland enacted prior to April 1, 1949, no person shall be entitled to any exemption or immunity from or any privilege in respect of any duty or tax imposed by an Act of the Parliament of Canada. By a proclamation made on April 1, 1949, the Customs Act and the Customs Tariff Act were declared to be in force in the new province as of that date, and by a further proclamation of May 9, 1949, The Income Tax Act was declared to be in force on the date of the publication of the proclamation. These proclamations are in terms stated to be made under the provisions of paragraph 2 of Term 18. The amendment to The Income Tax Act was not one made with the consent of the Legislature of the Province of Newfoundland under the provisions of subsection 3 of section 18. If the legislation is effective, a substantial part of the consideration which the agreements and the confirming statute provided should move from Newfoundland to the company and upon the faith of which the latter and its predecessors entered into the agreements, expended these large sums of money and undertook these continuing obligations, would be taken away.\nNewfoundland was prior to its entry into Confederation a unitary state: the property and revenues of the Dominion were vested in the Sovereign, subject to the disposal and appropriation of the Governor and the Commission of Government. It cannot be successfully contended that by amending or repealing the statutes which confirmed and gave the force of law to the various agreements made between the company and the Dominion these might not have been either amended or terminated. Upon such entry, however, the powers, executive and legislative, and the right to dispose of the said revenues were distributed between the new province and Canada in the manner defined by s. 91 and 92 of the British North America Act, subject, however, to the terms of the amendment of 1949. Since the statutes in question confer rights such as the exemption from municipal taxation and all other provincial taxation, which are matters lying entirely within the jurisdiction of the province, and at the same time grant exemptions from custom duties and taxation of a nature lying entirely within the jurisdiction of the Dominion, the question to be determined is whether by unilateral action the Dominion may \"repeal\" or alter the statutes or the law as declared by them relating to matters clearly falling within section 91.\nThe amendment to the Income Tax Act of 1949 and the terms of the Customs Act and the Customs Tariff Act of Canada are repugnant to the terms of the statutes of Newfoundland dealing with these matters which have been referred to. Parliament has not assumed to repeal the statutes in toto but merely to amend the law as declared by them in respect to matters within the jurisdiction of Parliament. In determining the question no assistance is obtained from what transpired in the years immediately following the Act of Union of 1867. Parliament at that time by a series of enactments assumed to repeal in whole or in part a large number of statutes of the former Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, but its power to do so was not questioned. In 1880 there was a reference to this court In Re New Brunswick Penitentiary 26, to determine whether the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada in respect of the establishment, maintenance and management of penitentiaries could in any way be limited, restricted or affected by legislation of the Province of New Brunswick, either previous or subsequent to Confederation. It was there held that since Canada had the exclusive power of legislation in reference to criminal law, except the constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction but including procedure in criminal matters and also as to the establishment, maintenance and management of penitentiaries, Parliament alone was vested with power to decide what classes of prisoners should be imprisoned and maintained in the penitentiary. I refer to the case since it was contended that it gave some support to the position of Canada in the present matter. However, I find nothing in the decision which is of assistance in determining the present questions and, so far as I can discover, there is no decision binding upon us affecting them until the decision of the judicial committee in Dobie v. The Temporalities Board 27. The decision of the main point in that matter turned upon the proper interpretation to be placed on s. 129 of the British North America Act, 1867, and that section is not to be distinguished from subsections 1 and 4 of s. 18. Much reliance has been placed by the company upon the provisions of subsection 3 of s. 18 but, other than as an indication that the parties responsible for the drafting of the terms were of the opinion that there were laws in force in Newfoundland relating to matters within federal jurisdiction, the repeal or amendment of which would require the consent of the new province, I think the subsection does not affect the matter. The facts in Dobie's case are fully stated elsewhere and need not be here repeated. Lord Watson's judgment, at page 147, says that, in order to ascertain how far the Provincial Legislature of Quebec had power to alter or amend the Act of the Province of Canada passed in 1858, it was necessary to consider whether it could be established that in the absence of all previous legislation on the subject the Quebec Legislature would have been authorized by s. 92 to pass an Act identical in its terms and that, if it could not do so, it could not repeal or alter the statute of 1858. The statement, is, however, amplified and explained by what follows. In a later passage of the judgment, after pointing out that the Quebec Act of 1875 dealt with the civil rights of a corporation and of individuals, present or future, for whose benefit it was created, Lord Watson said that if those rights and interests were capable of division according to their local position in Ontario and Quebec respectively, the legislature of each province would have power to deal with them so far as situate within the limits of its authority, and then said:\u2014(p. 150)\nThe Quebec Act 38 Vict. c. 64 does not profess to repeal and amend the Act of 1858, only in so far as its provisions may apply to or be operative within the province of Quebec, and its enactments are apparently not framed with a view to any such limitation. The reason is obvious, and it is a reason which appears to their Lordships to be fatal to the validity of the Act. The corporation and the corporate trust, the matters to which its provisions relate, are in reality not divisible according to the limits of provincial authority. In every case where an Act applicable to the two provinces of Quebec and Ontario can now be validly repealed by one of them, the result must be to leave the Act in full vigour within the other province. But in the present case the legislation of Quebec must necessarily affect the rights and status of the corporation as previously existing in the province of Ontario, as well as the rights and interests of individual corporators in that province.\nThus in the case of an Act of the Province of Canada applicable to the two provinces of Quebec and Ontario, either province, though it could not have enacted it, could validly repeal it in so far as it applied to matters within its own legislative jurisdiction, so long as it was left in full vigour in the other province. The decision in Dobie's case turned upon the point as to whether the Quebec Act in question dealt with matters which lay outside the powers given to the province by s. 92 and, as it dealt with the constitution and privileges of a company having its corporate existence and rights in Ontario as well as in Quebec, it was held ultra vires. The imposition of a federal income tax and of customs duties are within the powers vested in Parliament by section 91. It is apparently unfortunately the fact that in the present matter to deprive the company of these exemptions will be to cause virtually a frustration of the contracts. The question, however, is as to the right to exercise these powers and not the consequences of such exercise. I do not consider that the decision in Dobie's case affects that right, or that it is otherwise impaired or taken away.\nBy the terms of subsection 1 of s. 18 of the Terms of Union all laws in force in Newfoundland at the date of union are to continue, subject to be repealed, abolished or altered by the Parliament of Canada or by the Legislature of the Province of Newfoundland, according to the authority of Parliament or of the Legislature under the British North America Acts 1867 to 1946. In enacting the amendment to The Income Tax Act and proclaiming the Customs and the Customs Tariff Act and other statutes dealing with matters admittedly within federal jurisdiction and which are repugnant to the terms of the statutes in question, Canada has, in my opinion, altered the law as declared by them by a valid exercise of its powers under the British North America Act and the Terms of Union.

Ltd. Because of its interference with navigation and in view of the inaction of appellants, the Department of Transport caused the wreck to be removed from the channel and left elsewhere on the bed of the river. The action taken by the Crown to recover the costs of the removal was maintained by the trial judge who held that the Minister was not bound to have the wreck sold and that both appellants were jointly and severally liable for the expenses. Held (The Chief Justice and Rand J. dissenting) that the sale of the property removed from interference with navigation is a condition precedent to the recovery, under s. 17 of The Navigable Waters' Protection Act, of the expenses of removal unless there is nothing which can be sold. The Crown, invoking a statute which creates an obligation unknown at common law and which must be interpreted strictly, cannot recover as it did not bring itself within the conditions of the statute.\nPer The Chief Justice (dissenting): As the Minister was not obliged to sell and furthermore as it was established that there was nothing which could be sold, the Crown can recover from the owner of the barge and from the tug, as being in charge of the barge, but not jointly and severally.\nPer Rand J. (dissenting): The sale of the property is not a perequisite to recovery, but credit must be given to the owner for the salvage value, whether that value is realized by sale or by valuation. The owners of the tug do not come within the scope of s. 17 of the Act.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Angers J. 1, holding that both appellants were jointly and severally liable for the costs of removal of the wreck made by the Crown.\nL\u00e9on M\u00e9thot, K.C., for appellant Sauvageau.\nJ.

Il en serait r\u00e9sult\u00e9 que, dans les circonstances, le Roi n'avait aucun recours, soit en fait, soit en droit, contre les trois appelants Sauvageau.\nL'autre appelante, \"the Price Navigation Company Limited\", a ni\u00e9 que lors du naufrage de la barge, elle en avait la charge et le contr\u00f4le exclusif. Elle a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans sa plaidoirie \u00e9crite, qu'en fait, cette barge \u00e9tait alors sous le contr\u00f4le du capitaine et de l'\u00e9quipage de la barge ellem\u00eame ou de ses propri\u00e9taires. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que le co\u00fbt de l'enl\u00e8vement \u00e9tait exhorbitant et exc\u00e9dait toutes d\u00e9penses raisonnables qui auraient pu \u00eatre encourues de ce chef.\nA ces d\u00e9fenses, Sa Majest\u00e9 le Roi a r\u00e9pondu que ce ne fut que par suite de la n\u00e9gligence des appelants d'enlever l'\u00e9pave et apr\u00e8s avoir demand\u00e9 des soumissions \u00e0 plusieurs entreprises dans le renflouement et le d\u00e9placement des \u00e9paves que le Ministre des Transports dut, dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la navigation, prendre l'initiative de l'enl\u00e8vement et de d\u00e9placement de l'\u00e9pave.\nSur la production de ces diff\u00e9rentes d\u00e9fenses et r\u00e9ponses, la contestation fut li\u00e9e.\nLe jugement rendu par la Gour de l'\u00c9chiquier (Angers J.) 3est \u00e0 l'effet que l'\u00e9pave de la barge Bel\u0153il \u00e9tait un obstacle \u00e0 la navigation et qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9plac\u00e9e par le minist\u00e8re des Transports \u00e0 la suite de mises en demeure, par lettres recommand\u00e9es, aux appelants Arthur Sauvageau et la compagnie Price; que cette compagnie avait le contr\u00f4le et la charge de la barge lorsqu'elle sombra et que, de ce fait, elle est tenue, en vertu de la Loi, au m\u00eame degr\u00e9 que les propri\u00e9taires Sauvageau, au remboursement \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 le Roi du montant pay\u00e9 pour l'enl\u00e8vement de l'\u00e9pave.\nLe jugement d\u00e9cide que la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e9lait que le co\u00fbt du d\u00e9placement s'est v\u00e9ritablement \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00e0 $18,168.32, tel que constat\u00e9 par les \u00e9tats de comptes produits, et que cette somme a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9e \u00e0 m\u00eame les deniers publics du Canada durant l'ann\u00e9e fiscale 1942-1943.\nLe jugement d\u00e9cide, en plus, qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli par la preuve que la ferraille de la barge aurait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une valeur d'environ $5,500, dont il aurait fallu, cependant, d\u00e9duire celle de $500 pour r\u00e9duire la barge \u00e0 la ferraille; mais, qu'il fut \u00e9galement prouv\u00e9, sans contradiction, qu'il n'y avait aucun avantage \u00e0 vouloir la renflouer et vendre l'\u00e9pave, parce qu'il aurait fallu pour cela utiliser deux autres navires, au co\u00fbt de $6,000, et que le minist\u00e8re n'\u00e9tait pas int\u00e9ress\u00e9 dans autre chose que de lib\u00e9rer le chenal.\nApr\u00e8s, ainsi que le Juge de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier le d\u00e9clare, avoir examin\u00e9 attentivement la preuve orale et documentaire, \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la Loi et la jurisprudence, il en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion que les appelants, en vertu de la Loi de la protection des eaux navigables, \u00e9taient conjointement et solidairement responsables du remboursement de la somme de $18,168.32, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat, du 21 avril 1943, date de la signification de l'Information, et les d\u00e9pens; et il rendit jugement dans ce sens. L'Information avait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9e \u00e0 Dame Marie Poliquin-Malone, faisant affaires sous la raison sociale de J. C. Malone & Company, mais elle fut rejet\u00e9e quant \u00e0 Dame Marie Poliquin-Malone, et il n'y a pas eu d'appel de cette partie du jugement.\nLa cause est r\u00e9gie par la Loi de la protection des eaux navigables (S.R.C. 1927, c. 140).\nL'article 14 de cette Loi d\u00e9cr\u00e8te ce qui suit:\n14. Si la navigation de quelque eau navigable sur laquelle s'\u00e9tend la juridiction du Parlement du Canada est obstru\u00e9e, embarrass\u00e9e ou rendue plus difficile ou plus dangereuse par suite du naufrage d'un navire qui a sombr\u00e9, s'est \u00e9chou\u00e9 ou s'est jet\u00e9 \u00e0 la c\u00f4te, ou de ses \u00e9paves, ou de toute autre chose, le propri\u00e9taire, le capitaine, le patron ou l'individu en charge du navire ou autre objet qui constitue cette obstruction ou cet obstacle, doit imm\u00e9diatement donner avis de l'existence de l'obstruction au ministre, ou au percepteur des douanes et de l'accise du port le plus rapproch\u00e9 ou dont l'acc\u00e8s est le plus facile, et placer et, tant que subsiste l'obstruction ou l'obstacle, maintenir, de jour, un signal suffisant, et, de nuit, une lumi\u00e8re suffisante pour en indiquer la situation.\n2. Le ministre peut faire placer et maintenir ce signal et cette lumi\u00e8re si le propri\u00e9taire, le capitaine, le patron ou l'individu en charge du navire ou de l'objet qui cause l'obstruction ou l'obstacle manque ou n\u00e9glige de le faire.\n3. Le propri\u00e9taire de ce navire ou de cette chose doit aussit\u00f4t en commencer l'enl\u00e8vement, qu'il doit poursuivre avec diligence jusqu'\u00e0 ce que l'enl\u00e8vement soit complet; mais rien dans le pr\u00e9sent article ne peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme restreignant les pouvoirs que la pr\u00e9sente loi conf\u00e8re au ministre.\nL'article 15, ayant trait au pouvoir du ministre des Transports (ci-devant Ministre de la Marine et des p\u00eacheries), ordonne, entre autres:\n15. Si le ministre est d'avis\n(a) que la navigation de ces eaux navigables est ainsi obstru\u00e9e, embarrass\u00e9e ou rendue plus difficile ou dangereuse par le fait d'un navire ou de ses \u00e9paves, sombres, en partie sombres, ou jet\u00e9s \u00e0 la c\u00f4te ou \u00e9chou\u00e9s, ou par le fait de quelque autre obstacle; ou................................... il peut, lorsque l'obstruction ou l'obstacle ainsi caus\u00e9 ' subsiste pendant plus de vingt-quatre heures, le faire enlever ou d\u00e9truire de la mani\u00e8re et par les moyens qu'il croit convenable d'employer.\nL'article 16, concernant le transport de l'obstruction, sa vente et l'emploi du produit, est ainsi con\u00e7u:\n16. Le ministre peut ordonner que ce navire, ou sa cargaison, ou les objets qui constituent l'obstruction ou l'obstacle, ou en font partie, soient transport\u00e9s \u00e0 l'endroit qu'il juge convenable, pour y \u00eatre vendus aux ench\u00e8res ou de toute autre mani\u00e8re qu'il croit plus avantageuse; et il peut en employer le produit \u00e0 couvrir les d\u00e9penses contract\u00e9es par lui pour faire placer et entretenir un signal ou un feu destin\u00e9 \u00e0 indiquer la situation de cette obstruction ou de cet obstacle, ou pour faire enlever, d\u00e9truire ou vendre ce navire, cette cargaison ou ces objets. 2. Il est tenu de remettre tout surplus du produit de cette vente du navire, de la cargaison ou des objets, au propri\u00e9taire, ou \u00e0 toutes autres personnes qui ont droit de r\u00e9clamer la totalit\u00e9 ou partie du produit de la vente.\nL'article 17, relatif au co\u00fbt de l'enl\u00e8vement ou la destruction d'une \u00e9pave et \u00e0 son recouvrement, contient, entre autres, les dispositions suivantes:\n17. Lorsque, sous l'autorit\u00e9 des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente Partie, le ministre\na)........................\nb) a fait enlever ou d\u00e9truire quelque d\u00e9bris, navire ou \u00e9pave, ou quelque autre objet par lequel la navigation de ces eaux navigables est devenue ou deviendrait vraisemblablement obstru\u00e9e, embarrass\u00e9e ou est ou serait rendue plus difficile ou dangereuse; ou\nc) ........................\net que les frais d'entretien de ce signal ou de ce feu, ou de l'enl\u00e8vement ou de la destruction de ce navire, ou de ses \u00e9paves, de d\u00e9bris ou d'un autre objet, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s sur les deniers publics du Canada; et que le produit net de la vente, effectu\u00e9e en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente Partie, du navire ou de sa cargaison, ou de l'objet qui causait l'obstruction ou en faisait partie, ne suffit pas \u00e0 couvrir le co\u00fbt ainsi acquitt\u00e9 \u00e0 m\u00eame les deniers publics du Canada, l'exc\u00e9dent de ces d\u00e9penses sur ce produit net, ou le montant total de ces d\u00e9penses s'il n'y a rien qui puisse \u00eatre vendu, ainsi qu'il est dit ci-dessus, est recouvrable, avec d\u00e9pens, par la Couronne,\na) Du propri\u00e9taire du navire ou de l'objet qui causait l'obstruction ou l'obstacle, ou du propri\u00e9taire-g\u00e9rant, ou du capitaine, du patron ou de l'individu en charge du navire ou de l'objet lorsque l'obstruction ou l'obstacle s'est produit; ou\nb) De toute personne qui, par son fait ou par sa faute, ou par le fait ou par la n\u00e9gligence de ses serviteurs, a \u00e9t\u00e9 cause que cette obstruction ou cet obstacle s'est produit ou a subsist\u00e9.\nComme le dit tr\u00e8s bien le Juge de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier: \"L'\u00e9conomie de la Loi de la protection des eaux navigables est qu'aucune obstruction ne doit \u00eatre tol\u00e9r\u00e9e dans les eaux navigables. Il en va de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des navires qui y circulent\". Les appelants, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 notifi\u00e9s d'avoir \u00e0 enlever la barge du chenal o\u00f9 elle avait sombr\u00e9, parce qu'elle \u00e9tait devenue un danger pour la navigation, \u00e9taient tenus de voir \u00e0 l'enl\u00e8vement de cette \u00e9pave de la position o\u00f9 elle se trouvait, et cela imm\u00e9diatement puisqu'elle obstruait la navigation.\nOn voit par l'article 14, ci-dessus reproduit, qu'ils \u00e9taient m\u00eame oblig\u00e9s de donner imm\u00e9diatement avis de l'existence de l'obstruction au Ministre ou au Percepteur des douanes et de l'accise du port le plus rapproch\u00e9 ou dont l'acc\u00e8s est le plus facile, et placer et, tant que subsistait l'obstruction ou l'obstacle, de maintenir, de jour, un signal suffisant, et, de nuit, une lumi\u00e8re suffisante pour en indiquer la situation.\nLe propri\u00e9taire de la barge devait aussit\u00f4t en commencer l'enl\u00e8vement et le poursuivre avec diligence jusqu'\u00e0 ce que l'enl\u00e8vement fut complet. L'article 14 ajoute que rien dans cet article ne pouvait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme restreignant les pouvoirs que la Loi conf\u00e8re au Ministre.\nEt, en vertu de l'article 15, si le Ministre \u00e9tait d'avis que la navigation des eaux navigables \u00e9tait ainsi obstru\u00e9e, embarrass\u00e9e ou rendue plus difficile ou dangereuse par le fait de cette \u00e9pave, il avait le pouvoir, lorsque l'obstruction ou l'obstacle ainsi caus\u00e9 subsistait pendant plus de vingt-quatre heures, de le faire enlever ou d\u00e9truire de la mani\u00e8re et par les moyens qu'il croyait convenable d'employer.\nL'article 16 ajoute que le Ministre pouvait ordonner que la barge soit transport\u00e9e \u00e0 l'endroit qu'il jugeait convenable pour y \u00eatre vendue aux ench\u00e8res ou de toute autre mani\u00e8re qu'il croyait plus avantageuse. Il pouvait, dans ce cas, employer le produit de la vente \u00e0 couvrir les d\u00e9penses contract\u00e9es par lui pour faire placer et entretenir un signal ou un feu destin\u00e9 \u00e0 indiquer la situation de cette obstruction ou de cet obstacle, ou pour faire enlever, d\u00e9truire ou vendre cette barge.\nDans le cas de vente, le Ministre est tenu de remettre tout surplus au propri\u00e9taire ou \u00e0 toutes autres personnes qui ont droit de r\u00e9clamer la totalit\u00e9 ou partie du produit de la vente.\nEnfin, d'apr\u00e8s l'article 17, lorsque le Ministre fait enlever ou d\u00e9truire quelque d\u00e9bris ou \u00e9pave, et que les frais d'entretien du signal qu'il a ordonn\u00e9 de faire mettre pour indiquer l'endroit o\u00f9 l'\u00e9pave se trouvait, ainsi que les frais de l'enl\u00e8vement ou de la destruction sont pay\u00e9s sur les deniers publics du Canada; et que le produit net de la vente, effectu\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi, ne suffit pas \u00e0 couvrir le co\u00fbt ainsi acquitt\u00e9 \u00e0 m\u00eame les deniers publics du Canada, l'exc\u00e9dent de ces d\u00e9penses sur ce produit net, ou le montant total de ces d\u00e9penses, s'il n'y a rien qui puisse \u00eatre vendu, ainsi qu'il est dit ci-dessus, est recouvrable, avec d\u00e9pens, par la Couronne, du propri\u00e9taire de l'objet qui causait l'obstruction, ou du propri\u00e9taire-g\u00e9rant, ou du capitaine, du patron ou de l'individu en charge de l'objet lorsque l'obstruction ou l'obstacle s'est produit; ainsi que de toute personne qui, par son fait ou par sa faute, ou par le fait ou par la n\u00e9gligence de ses serviteurs, a \u00e9t\u00e9 cause que cette obstruction ou cet obstacle s'est produit ou a subsist\u00e9.\nLes propri\u00e9taires Sauvageau avaient \u00e0 bord de la barge, lors de son naufrage, deux de leurs employ\u00e9s, savoir, Henri-Paul Sauvageau et Daneau, qui \u00e9taient pay\u00e9s par eux. Le jugement les qualifie respectivement comme le matelot et le capitaine.\nL'eau qui \u00e9tait entr\u00e9e dans la cale de la barge provenait des fortes vagues soulev\u00e9es par un vent assez violent durant la soir\u00e9e. Le juge d\u00e9clare que cette barge \u00e9tait \u00e9tanche et en \u00e9tat de naviguer, en sorte que l'eau n'y est pas p\u00e9n\u00e9tr\u00e9e par suite d'un d\u00e9faut de la barge elle-m\u00eame.\nD'autre part, le juge d\u00e9cide, en fait, que \"the Price Navigation Company Limited\" avait le contr\u00f4le et la charge de la barge lorsqu'elle sombra. Pour d\u00e9cider ainsi, il s'est appuy\u00e9 sur le t\u00e9moignage de Larsen, le capitaine du remorqueur, qui, dit-il, \"sur ce point est cat\u00e9gorique\". C'est de l\u00e0 qu'il conclut que l'appelante \"Price Navigation Company Limited\" \u00e9tait donc tenue, comme les propri\u00e9taires Sauvageau, au remboursement \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 le Roi du montant que celui-ci a pay\u00e9 pour l'enl\u00e8vement de l'\u00e9pave.\nLa preuve invoqu\u00e9e par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance est que la barge n'avait aucun pouvoir quelconque pour se mouvoir par elle-m\u00eame. Elle \u00e9tait, sur ce point, enti\u00e8rement d\u00e9pendante du remorqueur, et, apr\u00e8s avoir op\u00e9r\u00e9 le d\u00e9chargement \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, elle devait, pour pouvoir se rendre ensuite \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, s'en rapporter exclusivement au remorqueur lui-m\u00eame.\nHenri-Paul Sauvageau d\u00e9clare bien que Daneau, le capitaine de la barge, \u00e9tait celui qui en avait la charge et qui donnait les ordres. La barge avait un gouvernail qui \u00e9tait man\u0153uvr\u00e9 par Daneau et \u00e0 ce point de vue l'on pouvait dire que ce dernier \"\u00e9tait en charge de la navigation de la barge\". Ce sont l\u00e0 les termes m\u00eames employ\u00e9s par Sauvageau dans son t\u00e9moignage. D'autre part, Larsen, dont le juge de premi\u00e8re instance d\u00e9clare que le t\u00e9moignage est \"cat\u00e9gorique\" \u00e0 l'effet que le capitaine du remorqueur avait la charge de la barge, t\u00e9moigne en effet comme suit:\nQ. With a tow like that, who shaped the course?\nR. The tow-boat, of course, or the master of the tow-boat.\n\"Tow-boat\" signifie le remorqueur. Donc, d'apr\u00e8s le capitaine de la \"Price Navigation Company\", le remorqueur \u00e9tait en charge de la navigation. Le fait est que, toujours au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, il d\u00e9crit ce qui se produisit lorsque les employ\u00e9s du remorqueur virent le signal donn\u00e9 par la barge les avertissant qu'elle \u00e9tait en p\u00e9ril:\n\u2014My mate was in the wheel-house. I told him we had better go for shelter and see what the trouble was. At that time, or a few minutes after, there was a steamer coming up and we had to give her the right-of-way. She proved to be the Saguenay of the Canada S.S. Line. By that time we were nearing the bend of Cap St. Charles, and then, after she had passed us, there was a big ocean steamer coming down, going towards Quebec. We had to give her the right-of-way and we started over to North. An ocean steamer was coming down with another auxiliary schooner and we had to obey the rules of the road, to give port to port.\nA mon avis, cela d\u00e9montre bien que pour la navigation la barge \u00e9tait enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 la charge du remorqueur et que c'est ce dernier qui devait n\u00e9cessairement contr\u00f4ler les op\u00e9rations. La barge ne pouvait prendre aucune initiative \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard et devait suivre; le remorqueur dans la direction que d\u00e9cidaient et que prenaient les personnes en charge de ce remorqueur.\nSi, donc, il est exact, comme l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 Sauvageau, que le capitaine Daneau \u00e9tait en charge de la barge, il est difficile, \u00e0 raison de la preuve, de ne pas en conclure, comme l'a fait le jugement dont il y a appel, que la navigation proprement dite du remorqueur et de la barge, prise comme unit\u00e9, n'\u00e9tait pas sous le contr\u00f4le et en charge des employ\u00e9s de l'appelante, \"the Price Navigation Company Limited\".\nMais, il reste maintenant \u00e0 appliquer \u00e0 ces faits la Loi de la protection des eaux navigables.\nLa premi\u00e8re objection des appelants serait que, en l'esp\u00e8ce, le Ministre n'aurait pas rendu une d\u00e9cision expresse \u00e0 l'effet que la barge constituait un obstacle \u00e0 la naviga- tion et qu'il fallait la d\u00e9placer du chenal, mais le Statut n'exige pas que le Ministre rende une d\u00e9cision formelle. La version anglaise lui permet d'agir simplement \"if, in his opinion\", et la version fran\u00e7aise est \"si le Ministre est d'avis\". M. Weir, qui s'est d\u00e9crit comme \"Superintendent of Lights in the St. Lawrence River, in the Montreal District\", dit qu'\u00e0 la suite des plaintes re\u00e7ues \u00e0 l'effet que la barge constituait un obstacle \u00e0 la navigation, il s'adressa au d\u00e9partement pour faire enlever l'\u00e9pave par un entrepreneur et demander des soumissions pour cette op\u00e9ration. Les soumissions furent demand\u00e9es; puis, le d\u00e9partement s'adressa \u00e0 M. Weir lui-m\u00eame pour savoir s'il prendrait la responsabilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9placer l'\u00e9pave. Il soumit un chiffre, \"much against my wishes\", dit-il, et il re\u00e7ut alors l'ordre du d\u00e9partement de pourvoir lui-m\u00eame \u00e0 l'enl\u00e8vement de l'\u00e9pave dans les vingt jours qui suivraient. Il consulta un capitaine Aussant, qu'il d\u00e9crit comme \"wrecking-master\" et, muni des conseils de cet expert, il proc\u00e9da au d\u00e9placement de l'\u00e9pave. Le co\u00fbt de ces op\u00e9rations s'\u00e9leva \u00e0 $18,168.32. Il en produisit un \u00e9tat comme exhibit dans la cause. Je ne trouve pas utile d'entrer ici dans les d\u00e9tails des op\u00e9rations qui, d'ailleurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9es par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance.\nOn demanda \u00e0 M. Weir si quelque chose aurait pu \u00eatre vendu apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9placement et il ajoute que le produit de cette vente possible n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisant pour couvrir le montant de $6,000 que le d\u00e9partement eut \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de d\u00e9penser pour le renflouement de l'\u00e9pave. Lui-m\u00eame, Weir, et le capitaine Aussant assist\u00e8rent personnellement \u00e0 ce d\u00e9placement. Il ajoute, d'ailleurs, que le co\u00fbt de l'op\u00e9ration n'inclut pas \"the departmental equipment\" qui fut utilis\u00e9 dans ce but.\nIl d\u00e9clare m\u00eame que premi\u00e8rement les propri\u00e9taires ne se donn\u00e8rent m\u00eame pas la peine de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la lettre par laquelle il les sommait d'enlever l'\u00e9pave, mais, qu'apr\u00e8s que les courroies eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9es sous la barge, il offrit aux propri\u00e9taires de terminer l'op\u00e9ration eux-m\u00eames et que cette offre ne fut pas accept\u00e9e.\nLe capitaine Aussant, entendu comme t\u00e9moin, confirme le t\u00e9moignage de M. Weir. Il r\u00e9sulte de tout ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de que, en vertu du principe bien connu, Omnia rite acta esse praesumuntur, m\u00eame si une d\u00e9cision formelle du Ministre \u00e9tait requise par l'article 15 de la Loi, l'on doit pr\u00e9sumer que cette d\u00e9cision avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue, puisqu'il n'est pas possible de penser que toutes ces op\u00e9rations auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 entreprises sur la seule initiative des employ\u00e9s du d\u00e9partement. Lorsque M. Weir, comme il l'affirme, s'adressa au d\u00e9partement pour en recevoir des instructions, il faut prendre pour acquit que ces instructions lui furent transmises de la part du Ministre; et si les appelants pr\u00e9tendaient que le Ministre n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis que les op\u00e9rations, telles qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, devaient \u00eatre entreprises, il incombait aux appelants eux-m\u00eames d'affirmer que le Ministre n'\u00e9tait pas intervenu et de le prouver.\nOn doit donc d\u00e9cider que, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 16 de la Loi, le Ministre a ordonn\u00e9 que la barge qui constituait l'obstruction soit transport\u00e9e \"\u00e0 l'endroit qu'il jugeait convenable\".\nL'article 16 ajoute que le Ministre pouvait alors ordonner que l'\u00e9pave fut vendue aux ench\u00e8res \"ou de toute autre mani\u00e8re qu'il croit plus avantageuse\". Il pouvait \u00e9galement faire d\u00e9truire ou vendre la barge. La fa\u00e7on d'en disposer \u00e9tait laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion.\nDans le cas actuel, il ordonna que la barge fut enlev\u00e9e de l'endroit o\u00f9 elle nuisait \u00e0 la navigation, et du moment que cette op\u00e9ration eut \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e9t\u00e9e, la barge fut laiss\u00e9e l\u00e0 o\u00f9 elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9e.\nComme l'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, le Ministre n'\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9 de faire plus. Il eut pu ordonner de d\u00e9truire la barge ou de la vendre, mais l'article 16 exprime ces diff\u00e9rentes op\u00e9rations dans l'alternative et, en plus, il n'est que facultatif, de sorte qu'il n'impose aucune obligation au Ministre; le tout est laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion.\nS'il d\u00e9cide de faire vendre la barge, alors, d'apr\u00e8s le paragraphe 2 de l'article 16, tout surplus du produit de la vente, au del\u00e0 du co\u00fbt de l'enl\u00e8vement ou de la destruction, doit \u00eatre remis au propri\u00e9taire ou \u00e0 toutes autres personnes qui ont le droit de r\u00e9clamer ce produit.\nEnfin, l'article 17 \u00e9dict\u00e9 que lorsque le Ministre a fait enlever l'\u00e9pave et que les frais de cet enl\u00e8vement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s sur les deniers publics du Canada; et que le produit net de la vente ne suffit pas \u00e0 couvrir le co\u00fbt ainsi acquitt\u00e9 \u00e0 m\u00eame les deniers publics du Canada, l'exc\u00e9dent de ces d\u00e9penses sur ce produit net, ou le montant total de ces d\u00e9penses, s'il n'y a rien qui puisse \u00eatre vendu, est recouvrable, avec d\u00e9pens, par la Couronne, du propri\u00e9taire de la barge qui causait l'obstruction (ici, ce sont les appelants Sauvageau), ou du patron ou de l'individu en charge de l'objet lorsque l'obstruction s'est produite.\nUn autre sous-paragraphe permet \u00e9galement au Ministre de recouvrer les d\u00e9penses de l'enl\u00e8vement de toute personne qui, par son fait ou par sa faute, ou par le fait ou par la n\u00e9gligence de ses serviteurs, a \u00e9t\u00e9 cause que cette obstruction s'est produite ou a subsist\u00e9; mais, dans le cas actuel, la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis qu'il n'y avait pas lieu d'appliquer ce dernier sous-paragraphe et il n'y a donc pas lieu d'y insister. Seule, d'ailleurs, l'appelante \"the Price Navigation Company Limited\" eut pu \u00eatre tenue responsable, en vertu de ce sous-paragraphe, si, par ailleurs, il ne pouvait pas \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que sa responsabilit\u00e9 est d\u00e9j\u00e0 engag\u00e9e, en vertu du sous-paragraphe (a) de l'article 17, comme patron ou individu en charge de la barge.\nLes appelants Sauvageau, comme propri\u00e9taires de la barge, ne peuvent donc \u00e9chapper \u00e0 leur responsabilit\u00e9 pour le montant des d\u00e9penses encourues pour l'enl\u00e8vement que s'ils ont raison de pr\u00e9tendre que le Ministre n'aurait pas accompli les formalit\u00e9s exig\u00e9es par la Loi de la protection des eaux navigables. La Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis que toutes les conditions requises avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies, et je ne puis me persuader, qu'en arrivant \u00e0 cette conclusion, il y a erreur dans le jugement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu.\nNous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 constat\u00e9 que le Ministre doit \u00eatre tenu pour avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis que la navigation des eaux navigables \u00e9tait obstru\u00e9e, embarrass\u00e9e ou rendue plus difficile ou dangereuse par le fait de l'\u00e9pave. Il a somm\u00e9 les propri\u00e9taires et l'appelante, \"the Price Navigation Company Limited\", de faire enlever ou d\u00e9truire l'\u00e9pave. Mais, non seulement cette sommation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ob\u00e9ie, les appelants n'en ont pas tenu compte, et M. Weir d\u00e9clare qu'il n'a re\u00e7u aucune r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la lettre de sommation qu'il leur avait fait parvenir par poste recommand\u00e9e. L\u00e0-dessus, usant de sa discr\u00e9tion, le Ministre ordonna que la barge fut transport\u00e9e \"\u00e0 l'endroit qu'il jugeait convenable\". Il se contenta de cela, le principal but des articles de la Loi en discussion ayant alors \u00e9t\u00e9 rempli, l'obstacle ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9 du chenal destin\u00e9 \u00e0 la navigation.\nIl n'y a rien dans la Loi \u00e0 l'effet que le Ministre \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9 de faire vendre l'\u00e9pave. L'article 16, nous le r\u00e9p\u00e9tons, n'est que facultatif. Mais, m\u00eame s'il l'eut fait vendre, le reste de l'article, qui lui permet d'employer le produit de la vente \u00e0 couvrir les d\u00e9penses contract\u00e9es par lui, n'est \u00e9galement que facultatif. Ce n'est que dans le paragraphe 2 de l'article 16 qu'il devient imp\u00e9ratif pour contraindre le Ministre, s'il a fait vendre, \u00e0 remettre tout surplus du produit de cette vente au propri\u00e9taire ou \u00e0 toutes autres personnes qui ont droit de r\u00e9clamer la totalit\u00e9 ou partie du produit de la vente.\nVenons-en maintenant \u00e0 l'article 17 sur lequel les appelants se sont surtout retranch\u00e9s pour pr\u00e9tendre que, comme il n'y avait pas eu vente de l'\u00e9pave, la Couronne ne pouvait rien r\u00e9clamer, soit du propri\u00e9taire, soit de \"the Price Navigation Company Limited\".\nCet article \u00e9dicte que, lorsque les frais encourus par le d\u00e9partement pour l'entretien des signaux ou pour l'enl\u00e8vement d'une \u00e9pave ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s sur les deniers publics du Canada; et que le produit net de la vente de l'\u00e9pave qui causait l'obstruction ne suffit pas \u00e0 couvrir le co\u00fbt ainsi acquitt\u00e9 \u00e0 m\u00eame les deniers publics du Canada, l'exc\u00e9dent de ces d\u00e9penses sur ce produit net, ou le montant total de ces d\u00e9penses s'il n'y a rien qui puisse \u00eatre vendu, est recouvrable, avec d\u00e9pens, par la Couronne, du propri\u00e9taire de l'objet qui causait l'obstruction, ou, en l'esp\u00e8ce, du patron ou individu en charge de l'objet lorsque l'obstruction ou l'obstacle s'est produit.\nIl faut envisager cet article d'abord au point de vue des faits; et la premi\u00e8re question qui se pose est celle de savoir s'il y avait quelque chose qui pouvait \u00eatre vendu dans le cas qui nous occupe. Car, la condition est bien claire: s'il n'y a rien qui puisse \u00eatre vendu, le montant total des d\u00e9penses de l'enl\u00e8vement est recouvrable, avec d\u00e9pens. Or\u2014et le t\u00e9moignage de M. Weir sur ce point n'est aucunement contredit\u2014apr\u00e8s que l'\u00e9pave eut \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9plac\u00e9e du chenal de la navigation (j'emploie ici les mots m\u00eames du t\u00e9moignage de M. Weir):\n\u2026if the vessel had been raised entirely, it would have meant taking the vessel out of the channel, where there was less current, turning around to the bottom again and using two other vessels with cross logs or gallow frames and raise her up again in order to bring her free of the water. This would have cost at least another $6,000\u2014and the Department was not interested in any other part of the work than clearing the channel of an obstruction. That was the reason why the vessel was not raised entirely.\nOn lui demande alors:\nQ. Now, could anything have been sold out of that wreck?\nR. Possibly, but not for any great amount of money, not enough to pay the Department for the extra $6,000\u2014as we have learned by experience on other occasions.\nQ. Have you had quite a long experience in that wrecking business?\nR. I believe I did my first wrecking job about 52 years ago.\nQ. According to your experience, Captain, do those wrecks bring quite a lot of money whenever they are sold?\nR. No money was to be made: all was lost.\nOn voit donc que la preuve d\u00e9montre que, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 17 (c), il n'y avait rien dans le cas actuel qui pouvait \u00eatre vendu; et il s'ensuit que le montant total des d\u00e9penses du d\u00e9partement est recouvrable, avec d\u00e9pens, par la Couronne.\nCette constatation dispenserait de discuter le sens de cet article 17 (c), mais, comme les appelants Sauvageau ont pr\u00e9tendu que le droit de la Couronne de recouvrer exigeait pr\u00e9alablement qu'il y eut eu une vente des d\u00e9bris de l'\u00e9pave, et que la Couronne ne pouvait recouvrer que si la vente de ces d\u00e9bris avait eu lieu, je dois dire que je ne puis me rendre \u00e0 ce raisonnement.\nLes diff\u00e9rents articles que nous avons cit\u00e9s au commencement de ce jugement doivent, suivant la r\u00e8gle d'interpr\u00e9tation ordinaire, \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s les uns par les autres. Aucun de ces articles ne fait une obligation au Ministre de vendre l'objet qui constituait l'obstruction ou l'obstacle. Au contraire, l'article 16, comme nous l'avons vu, est exclusivement facultatif. Comme le fait remarquer le t\u00e9moin Weir, le principal but de tous ces articles est qu'un obstacle \u00e0 la navigation soit \u00e9cart\u00e9 du chenal, et, du moment que cela est fait, ce but est atteint et l'esprit de la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9. M\u00eame s'il y a eu vente, par suite de l'exercice de la discr\u00e9tion du Ministre, l\u00e0 encore il n'y a pas d'obligation pour lui d'employer le produit \u00e0 couvrir les d\u00e9penses qu'il a contract\u00e9es pour faire placer les signaux ou pour faire enlever ou d\u00e9truire l'obstacle. Cette partie de l'article 16 n'est \u00e9galement que facultatif.\nDans toutes ces dispositions de la Loi, le seul article qui soit imp\u00e9ratif est le paragraphe 2 de l'article 16, en vertu duquel le Ministre, s'il a fait vendre, est tenu de remettre le surplus du produit de la vente, apr\u00e8s avoir pay\u00e9 les d\u00e9penses contract\u00e9es par lui, au propri\u00e9taire ou \u00e0 toutes autres personnes qui ont droit de r\u00e9clamer la totalit\u00e9 ou partie de ce produit.\nSi l'on tente d'interpr\u00e9ter l'article 16 concurremment avec l'article 17, il serait donc incompatible que le Ministre, qui, dans sa discr\u00e9tion, aurait d\u00e9cide de ne pas vendre, ne put recouvrer ses frais d'entretien ou d'enl\u00e8vement que s'il d\u00e9cidait de vendre. En l'esp\u00e8ce, cela voudrait dire que le d\u00e9partement aurait encouru une d\u00e9pense de $18,168.32, et, parce qu'il aurait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas vendre, vu que cette vente non seulement n'aurait rien rapport\u00e9 mais, au contraire, aurait ajout\u00e9 encore aux frais du d\u00e9partement, ainsi que le d\u00e9clare le t\u00e9moin Weir, l'article 17 ne lui permettrait pas de recouvrer de ceux qui les doivent les frais encourus par lui. Cette interpr\u00e9tation, suivant moi, conduirait litt\u00e9ralement \u00e0 une absurdit\u00e9.\nEn toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, mon opinion est que l'article 17 doit se lire dans l'alternative: s'il n'y a pas eu vente, soit parce \"qu'il n'y a rien qui puisse \u00eatre vendu\", soit parce que le Ministre, dans sa discr\u00e9tion, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait pas lieu de vendre, la Couronne a le droit de r\u00e9clamer le co\u00fbt de l'enl\u00e8vement, avec d\u00e9pens.\nCe n'est que s'il y a eu vente et que, les frais encourus par le d\u00e9partement ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9duits, il reste un surplus, ce surplus doit \u00eatre remis au propri\u00e9taire ou \u00e0 toutes autres personnes qui y ont droit. Dans ce cas, bien entendu, si le produit de la vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisant pour couvrir les frais du d\u00e9partement, il n'y a rien \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer.\nPour ces deux raisons, \u00e0 la fois parce que, suivant l'interpr\u00e9tation qui doit \u00eatre donn\u00e9e aux articles du Statut, le Ministre n'\u00e9tait pas tenu de vendre, et qu'il a droit de recouvrer ses frais, avec d\u00e9pens; et parce que \u00e9galement, dans la cause actuelle, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait rien \u00e0 vendre, puisque les frais qui eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu n\u00e9cessaires pour la vente eussent absorb\u00e9 et au del\u00e0 de ce que la vente de la barge aurait pu rapporter; quelle que soit la fa\u00e7on d'envisager l'article 17, soit du point de vue de l'interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gale, soit du point de vue des faits, je suis d'avis que le jugement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu contre les propri\u00e9taires Sauvageau est bien fond\u00e9 et doit \u00eatre maintenu.\nQuant \u00e0 l'appelante, \"the Price Navigation Company-Limited\", je suis du m\u00eame avis. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, c'\u00e9tait bien le personnel du remorqueur qui avait la charge de la barge. La preuve d\u00e9montre que cette barge ne pouvait rien faire d'elle-m\u00eame. Lorsque ceux qui s'y trouvaient, le capitaine Daneau et le matelot Sauvageau, constat\u00e8rent que les vagues embarquaient dans la barge et mena\u00e7aient de la faire couler, comme l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement s'est produit, ils \u00e9taient apparemment impuissants pour emp\u00eacher l'accident. Ils se mirent \u00e0 faire des signaux au personnel du remorqueur. Ce personnel se rendit bien compte que, si la barge \u00e9tait en p\u00e9ril, ce n'\u00e9tait pas les personnes qui \u00e9taient sur la barge qui pouvaient y rem\u00e9dier, mais, seul, le remorqueur pouvait le faire. Ainsi que l'avoua le capitaine Larsen, il a alors cherch\u00e9 \"for shelter\". C'est lui et non la barge qui devait se rendre \u00e0 ce \"shelter\". Mais, lorsqu'il tenta de le faire, d'abord le Saguenay, de la Canada Steamship Line, venait vers le remorqueur et il dut lui abandonner le droit de passage. Apr\u00e8s que le Saguenay l'eut d\u00e9pass\u00e9, un paquebot descendait le fleuve dans la direction de Qu\u00e9bec et l\u00e0 encore, il dut c\u00e9der le droit de passage \u00e0 ce paquebot. Ils \u00e9taient alors pr\u00e8s de la courbe qui contourne le Cap Saint-Charles. Il tenta de se diriger vers le nord, mais un autre paquebot descendait le fleuve \"with another auxiliary schooner\", et pour ob\u00e9ir aux r\u00e8gles du chemin (\"rules of the road\"), une fois de plus le remorqueur fut emp\u00each\u00e9 de suivre la manoeuvre qui lui paraissait n\u00e9cessaire.\nA la suite de tous ces emp\u00eachements, les personnes en charge du remorqueur s'aper\u00e7urent que la barge Bel\u0153il avait disparu. Ils mirent alors \u00e0 l'ancre et ils coup\u00e8rent la ligne de remorque qui les reliait \u00e0 la barge.\nTout ce r\u00e9cit du capitaine Larsen d\u00e9montre bien que c'est le remorqueur qui \u00e9tait en charge de la barge et que cette derni\u00e8re, par elle-m\u00eame, ne pouvait rien faire. Sans doute, il y avait sur la barge des personnes qui repr\u00e9sentaient les propri\u00e9taires, mais, au sens de la Loi de la protection des eaux navigables, c'\u00e9tait bien le personnel du remorqueur qui \u00e9tait en charge de la barge et qui, comme les propri\u00e9taires, doit \u00eatre tenu responsable vis-\u00e0-vis de la Couronne, ainsi que l'a jug\u00e9 la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier.\nLes appelants Sauvageau ont cit\u00e9, \u00e0 l'appui de leurs pr\u00e9tentions, un jugement de cette Cour dans la cause de Anderson v. The King 4.\nJe suis d'avis que cette cause ne s'applique pas \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce actuelle. Il faut d'abord faire remarquer que dans cette affaire la Cour s'est divis\u00e9e \u00e0 trois juges contre trois et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il n'y a pas eu vraiment de jugement rendu, ce qui a pour effet de laisser subsister le jugement de la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier, rendu par l'honorable juge Cassels, et par lequel l'action de la Couronne avait \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue.\nMais il suffit de lire les notes des juges de la Cour Supr\u00eame 5 pour constater que la question qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e et qu'ils ont discut\u00e9e n'\u00e9tait pas celle de savoir si, pour avoir le droit de recouvrer les frais d'enl\u00e8vement, la Couronne \u00e9tait d'abord oblig\u00e9e, comme condition essentielle et pr\u00e9alable, de vendre les d\u00e9bris de l'\u00e9pave pour r\u00e9clamer le d\u00e9ficit, s'il y en avait apr\u00e8s avoir appliqu\u00e9 le produit de la vente \u00e0 ces frais.\nDans la cause d'Anderson, le d\u00e9partement, qui avait demand\u00e9 des soumissions pour l'enl\u00e8vement de l'\u00e9pave, avait sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 que, comme compensation \u00e0 l'entrepreneur qui proc\u00e9derait \u00e0 l'enl\u00e8vement, \"the materials in the obstruction, when the removal is satisfactorily completed, but not before, to become the property of the contractor.\"\nTrois des juges (Sir Louis Davies, Juge en Chef, et les juges Brodeur et Mignault) furent d'avis qu'en proc\u00e9dant de la sorte, le d\u00e9partement avait en substance observ\u00e9 la Loi, puisque l'entrepreneur, s'il n'eut pas eu la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des d\u00e9bris de l'\u00e9pave, eut exig\u00e9 un montant plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour op\u00e9rer l'enl\u00e8vement; que le propri\u00e9taire avait eu le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de cette r\u00e9duction du co\u00fbt de l'enl\u00e8vement; qu'il n'avait donc subi aucun pr\u00e9judice et que rien ne pouvait le justifier de refuser de payer le co\u00fbt de l'enl\u00e8vement que lui r\u00e9clamait la Couronne.\nLes trois autres juges firent remarquer que l\u00e0 n'\u00e9tait pas la question. Le Statut prescrivait un mode sp\u00e9cial de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la vente des d\u00e9bris de l'\u00e9pave et il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour permettre \u00e0 la Couronne de recouvrer, dans les circonstances, que le d\u00e9partement ait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 strictement suivant les prescriptions de la Loi.\nOr, cette Loi ordonnait que, s'il y avait vente, il fallait qu'elle eut lieu \"aux ench\u00e8res ou de toute autre mani\u00e8re que le Ministre croyait plus avantageuse\". Ici, il n'y avait pas eu vente aux ench\u00e8res conform\u00e9ment au Statut, mais le Ministre avait adopt\u00e9 une proc\u00e9dure par laquelle l'entrepreneur de l'enl\u00e8vement devenait propri\u00e9taire des d\u00e9bris de l'\u00e9pave, en vertu m\u00eame de son contrat et sans qu'il y eut d'ench\u00e8res. La m\u00e9thode de proc\u00e9der prescrite par le Statut n'avait donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie et cela avait pour effet d'emp\u00eacher la Couronne de recouvrer.\nIl n'est nullement discut\u00e9 dans les raisons donn\u00e9es par les juges en cette cause pour arriver \u00e0 la conclusion adopt\u00e9e par eux, la question de savoir si le Ministre est oblig\u00e9 de faire vendre, comme condition essentielle et pr\u00e9alable, pour lui permettre ensuite de recouvrer les frais d'entretien des signaux, ainsi que les frais d'enl\u00e8vement ou de destruction.\nComme le fait remarquer Lord Halsbury dans la cause de Quinn v. Leathern 6:\n\u2026Now, before discussing the case of Allen v. Flood (1898 A.C. 1) and what was decided therein, there are two observations of a general character which I wish to make, and one is to repeat what I have very often said before, that every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved, or assumed to be proved, since the generality of the expressions which may be found there are not intended to be expositions of the whole law, but governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found. The other is that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides.\nLe jugement condamne les appelants conjointement et solidairement. Je ne crois pas qu'il s'agisse ici d'un cas de solidarit\u00e9, bien que les deux d\u00e9biteurs, c'est-\u00e0-dire, les propri\u00e9taires, d'une part, et \"the Price Navigation Company Limited\", d'autre part, soient \"oblig\u00e9s \u00e0 une m\u00eame chose\", soit au paiement de la m\u00eame somme d'argent (C.C. 1103); mais ils n'y sont pas oblig\u00e9s en la m\u00eame qualit\u00e9. Les appelants Sauvageau sont contraints \u00e0 rembourser en leur qualit\u00e9 de propri\u00e9taires de la barge; l'appelante, \"the Price Navigation Company Limited\", y est tenue comme \u00e9tant la personne en charge, au sens de la Loi.\nCependant, cela n'affecte pas le jugement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu, car je suis d'avis que l'obligation des appelants est indivisible (C.C. 1124) et chacun d'eux y est donc tenu pour le total (C.C. 1126). Le r\u00e9sultat reste donc le m\u00eame, sauf que le jugement doit subir cette l\u00e9g\u00e8re modification: les appelants ne sont pas responsables du remboursement \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 \"conjointement et solidairement\", mais chacun d'eux doit y \u00eatre tenu pour la somme totale de $18,168.32, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 compter du 21 avril 1943, et les d\u00e9pens; mais r\u00e9serve est faite en faveur de chacun d'eux du droit \u00e0 exercer leur r\u00e9clamation respective l'un contre l'autre, s'il y a lieu.\nJe suis donc d'avis que les appels respectifs des propri\u00e9taires Sauvageau et \"the Price Navigation Company Limited\" doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s, avec d\u00e9pens.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Locke JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014Le Juge en chef, dans des notes tr\u00e8s \u00e9labor\u00e9es, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on compl\u00e8te les faits qui ont donn\u00e9 naissance au pr\u00e9sent litige. Il a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 les pr\u00e9tentions respectives des parties, tant dans la plaidoirie \u00e9crite qu'\u00e0 l'argument devant cette Cour, et il serait en cons\u00e9quence inutile d'y revenir. Je me bornerai simplement \u00e0 discuter un seul aspect de cette cause, qui \u00e0 mon sens doit suffire pour en disposer. Je me dispenserai donc de consid\u00e9rer les autres questions soumises.\nLa Loi de la Protection des Eaux Navigables (R.S.C. 1927, c. 140), impose au propri\u00e9taire du navire, au capitaine, ainsi qu'\u00e0 la personne qui en \u00e9tait en charge au moment du sinistre, une nouvelle obligation, inconnue du droit commun, et conf\u00e8re \u00e0 la Couronne un droit, qu'avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de ce statut, elle ne poss\u00e9dait pas. (Anderson v. The King 7 ), (Arrow Shipping Co. v. Tyne Improvement Commissioners 8.\nDans la premi\u00e8re de ces deux causes, M. le Juge Anglin dit \u00e0 la page 387:\nWe are required to place a construction on sections 17 and 18. The latter section confers on the Crown a right which it did not theretofore enjoy. It subjects the owner of a vessel which founders in a place where it constitutes an obstruction to navigation, who may be entirely free from blame, to what may be a very serious burden. It is only fair to him that any conditions which Parliament has attached to the imposition of that burden should be fulfilled.\nDans la seconde, o\u00f9 la Chambre des Lords avait \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter un statut imp\u00e9rial 10 et 11 Vict. c. 27, s. 56, qui autorise le ma\u00eetre du h\u00e2vre \u00e0 enlever toute \u00e9pave et \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer le co\u00fbt de ses d\u00e9penses du propri\u00e9taire, et \u00e0 lui remettre le surplus de la vente de l'\u00e9pave, Lord Herschell s'exprime ainsi \u00e0 la page 516:\nAlthough I am of opinion that in the present case, there being no evidence that the disaster was due to the negligence either of the appellants or their servants, they would be under no liability at common law for damage caused by the obstruction or for the expenses incurred in removing it, yet I am unable to find any valid ground on which the operation of sect. 56, which casts upon the owner the liability to pay for the expenses of removing the obstruction, can be limited to cases in which such liability would exist at common law.\nLord Morris, \u00e0 la page 533, dit \u00e0 son tour:\nMy Lords, I concur in the judgment proposed. The facts of this case have been so fully stated by your Lordships who have preceded me that it is quite unnecessary I should repeat them. The defendants are under no common law liability of any kind. Their liability is the subject of express enactment:\u201410 & 11 Vict., c. 27, s. 56, enacts: \"The harbourmaster may remove any wreck or other obstruction to the harbour, dock, or pier, or the approaches to the same, and also any floating timber which impedes the navigation thereof, and the expense of removing any such wreck, obstruction, or floating timber shall be repaid by the owner of the same, and the harbour-master may detain such wreck or floating timber for securing the expenses, and on non-payment of such expenses on demand may sell such wreck or floating timber, and out of the proceeds of such sale pay such expenses, rendering the overplus, if any, to the owner on demand\".\nDepuis que la Loi de la Protection des Eaux Navigables a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en vigueur, le propri\u00e9taire du navire qui a sombr\u00e9, doit lib\u00e9rer le chenal obstru\u00e9 m\u00eame si le sinistre est le r\u00e9sultat d'un cas fortuit ou d'une force majeure, et en certains cas, il est tenu avec le capitaine et la personne en charge du navire, de rembourser le Gouvernement s'il entreprend lui-m\u00eame de faire dispara\u00eetre l'obstruction. Le cas fortuit et la force majeure, qui impliquent n\u00e9cessairement l'absence de faute prouv\u00e9e ou pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e, ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnus comme des fins de non recevoir, parce qu'ils d\u00e9passent le contr\u00f4le de l'homme. Mais en vertu de la loi sur laquelle se fonde l'intim\u00e9 pour r\u00e9clamer des appelants la somme de $18,168.32, cette d\u00e9fense de droit commun n'est plus reconnue. On y voit bien qu'en certains cas la personne qui par sa faute a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause de l'obstruction des Eaux Navigables, peut \u00eatre tenue responsable, mais vis-\u00e0-vis la Couronne, le statut ne fait aucune distinction, et la responsabilit\u00e9 de tous est engag\u00e9e. Dans le cas qui nous occupe, les appelants Sauvageau ont \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9s parce qu'ils \u00e9taient les propri\u00e9taires, et la Price Navigation Co. parce que d'apr\u00e8s l'honorable Juge au proc\u00e8s, elle avait le contr\u00f4le de la barge Bel\u0153il. La condamnation ne repose nullement sur la n\u00e9gligence des appelants, qui d'ailleurs n'est pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, et l'on voit appara\u00eetre imm\u00e9diatement avec cette Loi de la Protection des Eaux Navigables, une d\u00e9rogation aux principes du droit commun. C'est dire' qu'elle doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e strictement en faveur de ceux sur qui repose l'obligation nouvelle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e, et que la partie qui l'invoque doit d\u00e9montrer que toutes les conditions n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 son application ont \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies.\nEn adoptant cette loi, la L\u00e9gislature a \u00e9videmment voulu lib\u00e9rer l'\u00c9tat de l'imp\u00e9rieuse obligation qui repose primordialement sur lui d'enlever des Eaux Navigables les obstructions qui les encombrent, afin d'assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du public. On a voulu faire porter sur d'autres une partie du fardeau. Mais malgr\u00e9 cette exorbitante innovation, apparemment bas\u00e9e sur le statut britannique 40-41 Victoria, c. 16, d'ailleurs moins rigoureux, on trouve dans la loi certains temp\u00e9raments dont les appelants doivent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier n\u00e9cessairement. Apppliqu\u00e9e avec la rigueur que lui pr\u00eate l'intim\u00e9, la loi conduirait \u00e0 une injustice notoire.\nLa pr\u00e9tention de ce dernier est que quand un navire sombre dans les Eaux Navigables du Canada, m\u00eame comme cons\u00e9quence d'un cas fortuit ou de force majeure, le Ministre du Transport, apr\u00e8s vingt-quatre heures, si l'\u00e9pave n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9e, a le droit de la faire enlever ou d\u00e9truire, et de r\u00e9clamer la totalit\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses encourues du propri\u00e9taire ou de la personne en charge de ce navire. L'analyse des textes et de la jurisprudence me conduit \u00e0 la conclusion que la loi n'a pas toute cette s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9.\nLes articles pertinents \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause sont 14, 15, 16, 17. Ils peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de la fa\u00e7on suivante.\nLorsqu'un navire sombre et que son \u00e9pave obstrue les eaux navigables, le propri\u00e9taire, le capitaine ou la personne en charge du navire, doit imm\u00e9diatement en avertir les autorit\u00e9s. Le propri\u00e9taire du navire doit aussit\u00f4t commencer \u00e0 enlever cette obstruction, afin de lib\u00e9rer le chenal, mais s'il refuse ou n\u00e9glige de le faire, le Ministre peut, apr\u00e8s vingt-quatre heures, ordonner l'enl\u00e8vement ou la destruction de cet obstacle par les moyens qu'il croit convenable d'employer. Il peut \u00e9galement ordonner que le navire soit transport\u00e9 hors du chenal pour y \u00eatre vendu aux ench\u00e8res, ou de toute autre mani\u00e8re qu'il croit plus avantageuse, et il peut employer le produit \u00e0 couvrir les d\u00e9penses, et est tenu de remettre tout surplus \u00e0 ceux qui ont droit de le r\u00e9clamer.\nL'article 17 est \u00e0 l'effet que quand le Ministre a fait enlever une \u00e9pave, que les frais d'enl\u00e8vement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s \u00e0 m\u00eame les deniers publics du Canada, et que le produit net de la vente ne suffit pas \u00e0 couvrir les d\u00e9penses encourues, le Ministre ne peut r\u00e9clamer du propri\u00e9taire ou de l'individu en charge du navire, I'exc\u00e9dent des d\u00e9penses sur le produit net de la vente. Quand, ajoute l'article 17, il n'y a rien \u00e0 vendre, le Ministre a droit de r\u00e9clamer la totalit\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses.\nConform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi, les autorit\u00e9s comp\u00e9tentes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 imm\u00e9diatement averties de l'existence de l'\u00e9pave par quelques membres de l'\u00e9quipage, et elles ont en cons\u00e9quence fait placer des bou\u00e9es pour indiquer aux navigateurs le danger que pr\u00e9sentait cette obstruction dans le chenal, qui au large du Cap Saint-Charles, vis-\u00e0-vis Grondines, o\u00f9 le sinistre a eu lieu, n'a que quarante pieds de profondeur. Vu le d\u00e9faut ou la n\u00e9gligence des appelants d'enlever, de d\u00e9truire ou de transporter ce navire sombr\u00e9, qui de l'avis du Ministre rendait la navigation dangereus e, l'intim\u00e9 a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'enl\u00e8vement, et la barge a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en dehors du chenal, o\u00f9 elle ne constituait plus une obstruction que pouvaient craindre les navigateurs. Cette op\u00e9ration a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e au cours du mois de juin 1942, au co\u00fbt de $18,168.32, et en mars 1943, l'intim\u00e9 en a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 le montant des appelants, sans avoir pr\u00e9alablement proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la vente de l'\u00e9pave, dont le cr\u00e9dit aurait b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 aux appelants. C'est la pr\u00e9tention de ces derniers que cette vente \u00e9tait une condition pr\u00e9alable et n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'existence du droit d'action. Avec respect pour ceux qui partagent une opinion diff\u00e9rente, je crois cet argument bien fond\u00e9, et qu'il doit en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre accueilli.\nC'est en vertu de l'article 17 que le Ministre est investi du droit de poursuivre, et je ne puis arriver \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il est dispens\u00e9 de remplir les conditions auxquelles ce droit est subordonn\u00e9. En d\u00e9pouillant cet article de ce qui n'est pas pertinent \u00e0 cette cause, on peut en extraire les droits et obligations qui suivent. Lorsque le Ministre a fait enlever une \u00e9pave, et que les d\u00e9penses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es \u00e0 m\u00eame les deniers publics, et que le produit net de la vente n'est pas suffisant pour payer les d\u00e9penses, il peut r\u00e9clamer l'exc\u00e9dent, tel qu'expliqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. \"S'il n'y a rien qui puisse \u00eatre vendu\", le montant total de ces d\u00e9penses est recouvrable. Il me semble que la lecture de cet article r\u00e9v\u00e8le bien l'obligation du Ministre de faire vendre l'\u00e9pave afin d'en appliquer le produit au co\u00fbt des d\u00e9penses, et de soulager ainsi le fardeau impos\u00e9 aux autres personnes, souvent exemptes de toute n\u00e9gligence. Les mots \"s'il n'y a rien qui puisse \u00eatre vendu\" compl\u00e8tent l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00e0 l'effet qu'il devra toujours y avoir une vente, sauf dans le cas de d\u00e9faut d'objet. Cette derni\u00e8re alternative devait \u00eatre n\u00e9cessairement pr\u00e9vue, car on peut facilement supposer le cas de destruction compl\u00e8te de l'\u00e9pave ne laissant aucun d\u00e9bris, susceptible d'\u00eatre vendu, et le cas o\u00f9, tel que la loi l'y autorise, le Ministre r\u00e9clame les frais de pose et d'entretien de bou\u00e9es ou de signaux, pour indiquer l'existence d'une obstruction que le courant aurait emport\u00e9e subs\u00e9quemment, ou qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 dynamit\u00e9e. Dans ces derniers cas, il n'y a pas de doute possible que le Ministre peut r\u00e9clamer la totalit\u00e9 des d\u00e9penses. Mais dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, le navire a \u00e9t\u00e9 transport\u00e9 hors du chenal, et repose encore dans le fleuve o\u00f9 il a cess\u00e9 d'\u00eatre une obstruction, et la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le que sa valeur est substantielle. Il y avait donc quelque chose \"qui pouvait \u00eatre vendu\", et qui ne l'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9. Les appelants peuvent \u00e0 mon sens, justement se plaindre de l'absence de l'accomplissement de cette obligation, qui repose sur la Couronne, avant qu'elle ne puisse instituer des proc\u00e9dures.\nJe ne puis me rendre au raisonnement de l'intim\u00e9 au sujet des droits facultatifs que le statut conf\u00e8re au Ministre. Th\u00e9oriquement le Ministre n'est pas tenu de faire transporter une \u00e9pave, mais il peut le faire, et quand il le fait, ajoute l'article, c'est \"pour y \u00eatre vendue aux ench\u00e8res\" ou de toute autre mani\u00e8re qu'il juge convenable. En outre, l'article 17 est imp\u00e9ratif, et lorsque le Ministre a fait enlever une \u00e9pave, qu'il en a pay\u00e9 le co\u00fbt, que le produit de la vente est insuffisant, il peut r\u00e9clamer l'exc\u00e9dent. Les droits du Ministre ne lui sont pas impos\u00e9s; il est libre de les exercer, mais ses obligations sont imperatives, et sont les cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9cessaires de l'exercice de ses droits.\nDans une cause de Anderson v. Le Roi 9 jug\u00e9e par M. le Juge Cassels, les faits \u00e9taient les suivants:\nAnderson, le d\u00e9fendeur et propri\u00e9taire de la barge Empress, qui avait sombr\u00e9 dans le Barrington Passage, et \u00e9tait devenue une obstruction, a \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivi par Sa Majest\u00e9 le Roi pour les frais encourus par ce dernier pour la destruction et l'enl\u00e8vement des d\u00e9bris de la barge. La d\u00e9fense en Cour d'\u00c9chiquier \u00e9tait que, Anderson n'\u00e9tait pas le propri\u00e9taire de l'\u00e9pave, le vaisseau ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu \u00e0 un nomm\u00e9 Nickerson quelques jours apr\u00e8s le sinistre. Anderson pr\u00e9tendait que la r\u00e9clamation du Gouvernement devait \u00eatre dirig\u00e9e non pas contre le propri\u00e9taire du navire au temps du sinistre, mais contre le propri\u00e9taire de l'\u00e9pave. M. le Juge Cassels, en se basant sur le chap. 115 des Statuts Revis\u00e9s du Canada, 1906, art. 13, en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que le mot \"propri\u00e9taire\" comprenait le propri\u00e9taire enregistr\u00e9 d'un navire au moment du sinistre.\nCette cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e devant la Cour Supr\u00eame 10. La Cour s'est divis\u00e9e \u00e9galement de sorte que l'appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 sans frais, vu que le jugement de M. le Juge Cassels n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvers\u00e9. Mais la division \u00e9gale des juges ne signifie pas que le jugement de M. le Juge Cassels constitue une autorit\u00e9 qui lie cette Cour (Stanstead Election Case 11). D'ailleurs, l'analyse de Anderson et de Sa Majest\u00e9 le Roi r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la cause a \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9e devant cette Cour, non pas sur le point d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par M. le Juge Cassels en Cour d'\u00c9chiquier, mais sur un point enti\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rent, et qui ressemble particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 celui qui nous est soumis. Le Ministre de la Marine, (maintenant Ministre des Transports) avait demand\u00e9 des soumissions pour l'enl\u00e8vement de l'\u00e9pave de la barge Empress, et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu avec le plus bas soumissionnaire qui devait recevoir la somme de $750, qu'il dynamiterait la coque du navire, et qu'il enl\u00e8verait tous les d\u00e9bris et tous les accessoires qui deviendraient sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Quand le Ministre a institu\u00e9 les proc\u00e9dures contre Anderson pour se faire rembourser de ce montant de $750, ce dernier a plaid\u00e9 devant cette Cour, que les dispositions de la loi n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies, et que, vu qu'il n'y avait pas eu de vente pr\u00e9alable, l'action contre Anderson ne pouvait \u00eatre accueillie.\nTrois juges, MM. les Juges Idington, Duff et Anglin, en sont arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 la conclusion que, vu que le Ministre n'avait pas rempli les exigences imperatives du statut, \u00e0 savoir qu'il n'y avait pas eu de vente du navire, il ne pouvait pas instituer de proc\u00e9dures. M. le Juge Idington dit entre autres \u00e0 la page 381:\nThe Minister did not direct anything to be conveyed to any place or to be sold by auction. What happened was that he advertized for tenders for the execution of the work and in the advertisement expressly provided as follows:\u2014\nThe materials in the obstruction when the removal is satisfactorily completed, but not before, to become the property of the contractor.\nEt plus loin, \u00e0 la page 382:\nThat question is reduced solely to the one question of whether or not in this new remedy given the Crown to recover from the unfortunate owners of a wreck the cost of removing it, the steps laid down in the statute giving the remedy, as a condition precedent thereto, have been observed. I have come to the conclusion that they have not been observed. M. le Juge Duff, \u00e0 la page 385, s'exprime ainsi: Il r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 des num\u00e9ros diff\u00e9rents, mais la loi est tout de m\u00eame identique \u00e0 celle d'aujourd'hui:\nNow when section 18 is read in connection with section 17, (maintenant 17 et 16) it becomes apparent that \"sale under this part\" in section 18 refers to the sale authorized by section 17, and section 18 provides, if not in explicit terms, at least by plain implication, that if there is anything which can be sold, it is only the difference between the net proceeds of the sale of it and the amount of the costs which can be recovered. It is quite clear that there was something of appreciable value which could be sold;........................ And the appellant is entitled to succeed unless the condition of the statute is satisfied that there was a sale of these parts within the meaning of the statute.\nM. le Juge Anglin s'exprime de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nSection 17 imposes such a condition. If after the removal or destruction of a vessel by or at the instance of the Crown under section 16 there should be anything left \"which can be sold\", it must then be \"sold by auction or otherwise\" under section 17 before the Minister may invoke the remedy created by section 18 of maintaining an action for the balance of the expenses incurred by the Crown after crediting the proceeds of a sale under section 17.\nComme on peut le voir, ces trois juges en sont arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il n'y avait pas eu de vente de ce qui pouvait \u00eatre vendu, et comme cette vente est essentielle au droit de la Couronne de poursuivre, l'action, d'apr\u00e8s eux, devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Malgr\u00e9 que la Couronne payait la somme de $750, et que le plus bas soumissionnaire s'engageait \u00e0 dynamiter l'\u00e9pave, et \u00e0 devenir propri\u00e9taire de ce gui restait, ceci d'apr\u00e8s MM. les Juges Idington, Duff et Anglin, n'\u00e9tait pas suffisant pour satisfaire les prescriptions de la loi. Ils d\u00e9cident qu'il est n\u00e9cessaire qu'il y ait une vente pr\u00e9alable par ench\u00e8res ou autrement.\nLe Juge en chef Davies ne dit nulle part que la vente pr\u00e9alable n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour justifier la Couronne d'instituer des proc\u00e9dures. Il arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que Anderson devait payer parce que, dans son opinion, la preuve avait r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que la transaction qui \u00e9tait intervenue entre lui et la Couronne constituait une compl\u00e8te observation de la loi. Si la Couronne avait, dit-il, conserv\u00e9 un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans les d\u00e9bris du navire, le montant de la soumission aurait sans doute \u00e9t\u00e9 plus \u00e9lev\u00e9, et le premier \u00e0 en souffrir aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 Anderson. M. le Juge Davies laisse entendre que parce qu'il a soumissionn\u00e9 \u00e0 meilleur march\u00e9, le soumissionnaire a indirectement achet\u00e9 les d\u00e9bris. M. le Juge Brodeur ne se prononce pas cat\u00e9goriquement, et M. le Juge Mignault est le seul \u00e0 dire clairement \"that the sale cannot be a condition precedent to the right of the Crown to recover the cost of removal\".\nComme on peut le voir, la cause de Anderson v. Le Roi 12, loin d'\u00eatre un obstacle au succ\u00e8s des appelants, confirme plut\u00f4t leur pr\u00e9tention.\nDans Attorney-General of Canada v. Brister 13, la Cour Supr\u00eame de la Nouvelle-Ecosse a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie d'un litige o\u00f9 la m\u00eame question \u00e9tait soulev\u00e9e. A la page 55, Sir Joseph Chisholm C.J., avec qui a concouru Hall J., dit ce qui suit:\nFrom a fair reading of this section, it seems to be the duty of the Minister, if he can find a purchaser to make a sale of the thing which forms the obstruction or of its parts, and the right to sue the owner or other person mentioned in s.-ss. (a) and (b) depends upon whether or not such duty has been performed.\nEt plus loin, \u00e0 la m\u00eame page, malgr\u00e9 que son analyse des raisons des Juges Brodeur et Mignault dans la cause Anderson soit inexacte, Sir Joseph Chisholm dit cependant:\nThree learned Judges were of opinion that conditions precedent as to sale were substantially complied with, and three decided that there should be strict compliance with the direction of the statute. All, however, were of opinion that the preliminary conditions should have been observed, and to that extent at least the decision is binding upon us. The Anderson Case has features in common with the present case: the obstruction was destroyed; the agreement with the contractor was that he should have the materials; and there was substantial salvage in each case.\nSmiley J., avec qui s'est accord\u00e9 Carroll J., s'exprime dans les termes suivants:\nThere was nothing, under the provisions of s. 16, which in the language of the section could be conveyed to such place as the Minister thought proper and there sold by auction or otherwise as he deemed most advisable. Section 17 provides that the whole cost of removal or destruction is recoverable by the Crown if there is nothing which can be sold under the provisions of s. 16. In my opinion, therefore, the Minister did comply with the statute, as stated by the learned trial Judge, and the first contention urged by counsel for the appellants is untenable.\nOn voit par ce que dit M. le Juge Smiley que le Ministre avait ob\u00e9i aux prescriptions de la loi, parce que d'apr\u00e8s lui, la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e9lait qu'il n'y avait rien \u00e0 vendre, laissant entendre que dans le cas contraire, l'action n'aurait pu \u00eatre maintenue.\nJ'en arrive donc \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire que la barge Bel\u0153il fut offerte en vente \"par ench\u00e8res ou autrement\", avant que naisse le droit du Ministre de poursuivre. Come cette obligation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remplie, l'action doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e, et les deux appels maintenus avec d\u00e9pens devant cette Cour, et la Cour de l'\u00c9chiquier.\nRand, J. (dissenting): I am unable to interpret section 17 of the Navigable Waters' Protection Act as making a sale of the property removed from interference with navigation, whenever it has some net value, a condition precedent to the recovery of the expenses of removal. The basic provision of the statute is that of section 14 which imposes upon the owner the duty to remove the obstruction or danger. That is a positive and unqualified statutory obligation, which in the absence of fault or negligence, certainly at common law, and seemingly by the law of Quebec, did not before exist. It may, no doubt, become an extremely onerous duty, but the policy of it having been decided by Parliament, we must not, in ascertaining the meaning of the statute, be unduly influenced by the possible hardships to owners. Its real effect may be merely to throw the burden of insurance upon the owner rather than the cost of removal upon the public.\nWhen an accident or mishap occurs which brings about an interference with navigation, the Minister, under the authority of section 15, may cause the wreck, vessel or other thing \"to be removed or destroyed.\" Section 16 authorizes the Minister to \"transport\" and sell and to apply the proceeds towards the cost of removal or destruction. Section 17 permits recovery of the expenses paid out of the public moneys in the removal or destruction to the extent that the net proceeds of the sale are insufficient to cover them and the whole expense \"if there is nothing that can be sold as aforesaid.\" What is created is a charge on the property for the outlay in favour of the Crown and the Crown is bound to apply the net value in reduction of it.\nWhether or not there is anything that can be sold lies obviously in judgment, and to be sold to produce net proceeds depends upon what can be charged against the gross. The word \"remove\" in section 17 does not conflict with \"convey\" in section 16; since section 16 allows the Minister to charge the costs of \"removal\" and sale against the proceeds, the costs of \"conveyance\" are clearly included; and the same meaning is to be attributed to \"removal\" in section 17. Whether or not, then, the expenses of conveyance are brought in to ascertain \"net proceeds\", they are ultimately chargeable against proceeds. But the very uncertainty of net proceeds, as at what port or place, and whether $1 or $1,000, in addition to the risk of incurring unnecessary loss through mistaken judgment, excludes, in my opinion, an intention to prescribe sale as a prerequisite to recovery. What the statute deals with is the practical responsibility of keeping navigable waters free from such hazards; and where the owner refuses to discharge the duty imposed on him, as he did here, it enables the Government to perform that duty at his expense. What the owner is entitled to is credit for the salvage value of his property, and it makes no difference to him whether that value is realized by a sale or by valuation.\nThe officers of the department here decided upon removal only; the wreck was taken from close proximity to the channel and left in shallow water. It was estimated by the witness, Weir, that to bring the barge to a port would have cost an additional $6,000. But that was so by reason of a second operation of bringing it to the surface which the nature of the first made necessary. We have no figures on what the cost of a direct removal and conveyance would have been, but the facts would make it appear that it could not be less than that actually carried out.\nAlthough the barge was purchased at a sheriff's sale for $2,000, there was some evidence, that it might have brought $6,000. Since the Crown has failed to furnish any proof beyond the skeleton facts of the work done and costs, the owner must be given the benefit of matters not clearly established. Taking, then, the estimated cost of direct removal and sale to be at least $18,168.32, I would allow the owners a deduction of $6,000 as the salvage value.\nThe statute provides that recovery may be made where the removal is directed by the Minister and it is argued that it has not been shown that the Minister has acted at all, that the only evidence adduced was of action taken by subordinate officials of the Department. Are we entitled to assume, in such a case, that the Minister did in fact authorize the action taken? Considering, in addition to the ordinary departmental practice, that tenders were called for the removal, that the expenditure made was substantial and a statement of it sent to the Auditor General, the case is one for the maxim omnia rite acta esse praesumuntur, and the objection fails.\nThe owners of the tug appeal on the ground that they do not come within the scope of section 17: that they were neither \"a person in charge thereof at the time such obstruction or obstacle was occasioned\" nor did their act cause or occasion it, and this contention I think well founded. There were two men on the barge, one of whom was the superior: they were the persons in charge of it. To be \"in charge of\" the vessel or other thing means, in section 17, something more than to be furnishing a service of haulage to it. Nor did any act of the tug occasion the mishap; the towage was, no doubt, one of the conditions out of which the accident arose, but for the \"act\" aimed at we must look elsewhere.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal of the appellants, Price Navigation Company and dismiss the information, with costs in both courts; and allow in part the appeal of the owners by reducing the judgment to $12,168.32 with costs in this Court.\nFatjteux, J.:\u2014During the night of the 25th of September 1941, the Bel\u0153il, one of the three barges towed by the tug Chicoutimi, foundered in the St. Lawrence river, on the north side of the channel, near Cape St. Charles. It there and then became an obstacle to the navigation. Viewing the inaction of the interested parties, the Minister of Transport did, during the month of June 1942, cause this wreck to be removed. In the process, the barge was simply displaced from the channel and left elsewhere on the bed of the river. The cost of this removal, undertaken by the Department of Transport, has been defrayed out of the public moneys of Canada and amounted to $18,168.32. The Respondent ultimately took action to recover from the Sauvageau brothers and Price Navi- gation Company Limited, registered owners, respectively, of the barge and the tug, and against J. C. Malone and Company Limited, her charterers.\nBy judgment rendered on the 4th of September 1948, in the Exchequer Court 14, the action was dismissed as against the charterers and maintained as against the appellants, they being jointly and severally condemned to pay to the Respondent the amount above indicated with interest, and costs.\nThe appeal is against this condemnation only.\nThe Navigable Waters' Protection Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 140,\u2014part II\u2014, prescribes the rights and obligations of the parties and especially the remedies at the disposal of the Crown in like cases. Section 17 of the Act gives to the Crown a right to recover the expenses incurred by reason of such obstruction and its removal, from the owner of the vessel, from the person in charge thereof on the occasion of the disaster, or from any person through whose act or fault or that of his servants such obstruction or obstacle was occasioned or continued.\nThe relevant part of the section may conveniently be reproduced here:\u2014\n17. Whenever, under the Provisions of this Part, the Minister has caused\n(a) ..........................\n(b) to be removed........any wreck........by reason whereof the navigation of any such navigable waters was........obstructed, ........; or\n(c) ........................\nand the cost.........of removing.........such.........wreck or other thing has been defrayed out of the public moneys of Canada; and the net proceeds of the sale under this Part of such vessel or its cargo, or the thing which caused or formed part of such obstruction are not sufficient to make good the cost so defrayed out of the public moneys of Canada, the amount by which such net proceeds falls short of the costs so defrayed as aforesaid, or the whole amount of such cost, if there is nothing which can be sold as aforesaid, shall be recoverable with costs by the Crown,\n(a) from the owner of such vessel or other thing, or from the managing owner or from the master or person in charge thereof at the time such obstruction or obstacle was occasioned; or\n(b) from any person through whose act or fault, or through the act or fault of whose servants such obstruction or obstacle was occasioned or continued. In the present instance, the information filed by the Attorney General of Canada rests exclusively on the provisions of this Act. And it must further be noted that no fault or negligence of any of the appellants or their servants is alleged therein as a cause of action. The fact that they were owners of the barge, with respect to the Sauvageau brothers, and the fact that the barge was in its charge, with respect to the Navigation Company in the circumstances above indicated, are the sole juridical facts alleged as a \"lien de droit\" between the respective appellants and the Respondent. It is on the basis of the findings of such facts by the trial Judge 15 that the action was maintained against the appellants.\nApart from individual grounds of appeal, the appellants join in the following legal and factual submissions. As a matter of law, they contend that, if there is something which can be sold, the sale of the wreck is a condition precedent to the exercise of the right of the Crown to recover the costs for its removal. And further submitting, in point of fact, that the steel alone of the barge Bel\u0153il had a value of about $5,000, that no sale had been made or even attempted, they then conclude that the above statutory condition has not been complied with and that the action should have been dismissed.\nA like submission in law has been considered by this Court in Anderson v. The King16.\nOnly the relevant features of that case may be referred to.\u2014A schooner was burned to the water's edge, in Barrington Passage, a public harbour. The Minister advertised by tender for the execution of the work of removal. The contract, eventually let for $750, had a stipulation,\u2014as was intimated in the call for tenders,\u2014prescribing that \"\u2026the materials in the obstruction, when the removal is satisfactorily completed, but not before, to become the property of the contractor.\" Upon the execution of the work, the contractors took the property as their own and, afterwards, sold a part for a sum of $129 and had still some more left. An action was instituted by the Crown to recover from the owner of the wreck the sum of $750, the costs of advertisement and some other incidental expenses. The defendant submitted that the sale of the vessel was a condition precedent to the right to recover the expenses of removal and that the Minister had not properly exercised his discretion as to whether the wreck was an obstruction to navigation and as to the manner of its removal. To meet the first part of the defendant's submission, the Crown suggested that the materials thus offered to and accepted by the contractor were part of the consideration for the execution of the work and were thus virtually sold; for without such added consideration, the bid of the contractors would have exceeded $750.\nThe Anderson case, heard by six members of this Court, was concluded with divided opinions, which opinions were subsequently interpreted and summarized in the case of Attorney General of Canada v. Brister 17 by Sir Joseph Chisholm, C.J., at page 55, as follows:\u2014\nThree learned Judges were of opinion that conditions expressed as to sale were substantially complied with, and three decided that there should be strict compliance with the direction of the statute. All, however, were of opinion that the preliminary conditions should have been observed and to that extent the decision is binding upon us.\nWhile one may not fully agree with this interpretation or summary of the opinions of members of this Court in the Anderson case 18, I cannot fail to be impressed by the reasons for judgment given by three of the members of this Court who, without any possible ambiguity, affirmed that a sale of the wreck is a condition precedent to the exercise of the right of the Crown to recover the costs for its removal.\nIdington, J., at page 382, says:\u2014\nEven if we could find that there was a very trifling sum realized out of the property after its removal, I do not see how that would affect the question involved.\nThat question is reduced solely to the one question of whether or not in this new remedy given the Crown to recover from the unfortunate owners of a wreck the cost of removing it, the steps laid down in the statute giving the remedy, as a condition precedent thereto, have been observed. I have come to the conclusion that they have not been observed,\n\"So clear a departure from the terms of the Act should not, I submit, be maintained, no matter how well intentioned the modification made by the Minister or his deputy in carrying into effect the provisions of the Act may have been.\" I think the appeal should be allowed with costs. At page 384 of the report, Duff, J., as he then was, says:\u2014\nAt common law, the owner of a vessel becoming an obstruction to navigation in the absence of negligence or wilful default of the owner or persons in control of her, is not responsible for the consequences of the obstruction or chargeable with the cost of removing it, and the \"Navigable Waters' Protection Act\" imposes a new liability upon the owners of ships, which comes into existence in certain defined conditions; a liability which it would be difficult in many cases to describe as just or fair or reasonable.\nOn well-known principles the party who asserts in a particular case that the conditions of a new statutory liability have come into existence, must establish that proposition strictly and in ascertaining whether that is so or not, the inquiry is: Do the facts established clearly fall within the statutory description of those conditions?\nAnglin, J., as he then was, expresses the following views, at page 387:\u2014\nThe latter section confers on the Crown a right which it did not theretofore enjoy. Arrow Shipping Co. v. Tyne Improvement Commissioners (A.C. 1894-508), at pp. 527-8. It subjects the owner of a vessel which founders in a place where it constitutes an obstruction to navigation, who may be entirely free from blame, to what may be a very serious burden. It is only fair to him that any conditions which Parliament has attached to the imposition pf that burden should be fulfilled. Section 17 imposes such a condition. If after the removal or destruction of a vessel by or at the instance of the Crown under section 16 there should be anything left \"which can be sold\", it must then be \"sold by auction or otherwise\" under section 17 before the Minister may invoke the remedy created by section 18 of maintaining an action for the balance of the expenses incurred by the Crown after crediting the proceeds of a sale under section 17.\nThe legal submission of the appellants herein rests on the combined play of two principles. Affirming the first one Lord Herschell in Arrow Shipping Co. v. Tyne Improvement Commissioners above quoted says at page 508:\u2014\n\u2026I am of opinion that in the present case, there being no evidence that the disaster was due to the negligence either of the appellants or their servants, they would be under no liability at common law for damage caused by the obstruction or for the expenses incurred in removing it\u2026\nIn Pasmore v. Oswaldtwistle Urban District Council 19, the second principle is formulated by the Earl of Halsbury, L.C., at page 394:\u2014\nThe principle that where a specific remedy is given by a statute, it thereby deprives the person who insists upon a remedy of any other form of remedy than that given by the statute, is one which is very familiar and which runs through the law. I think Lord Tanterden accurately states that principle in the case of Doe v. Bridges (1831), 1 B. & Ad. 847, 859 (109 E.R. 1001). He says: \"Where an Act creates an obligation and enforces the performance in a specified manner, we take it be a general rule that performance cannot be enforced in any other manner.\"........The obligation which is created by this statute is an obligation which is created by the statute and by the statute alone.\nNo argument has been advanced on behalf of the Respondent to successfully challenge the correctness of these principles.\nIt was suggested, however, that in the circumstances of this case, a sale would, in the result, have brought no advantage to the appellants and that there was, thus, virtually nothing which could be sold within the meaning of the Act.\nAs proof of the premises of this conclusion, the following evidence is invoked by the Respondent, required to say why the Bel\u0153il was not refloated, J. D. Weir, the officer of the Department of Transport in charge of the operations, answered:\u2014\nThis would have cost at least another $6,000\u2014and the Department was not interested in any other part of the work than clearing the channel of an obstruction. That was the reason why the vessel was not raised entirely.\nAsked further whether anything could have been sold out of that wreck, he expresses the following opinion:\u2014\nPossibly, but not for any great amount of money, not enough to pay the Department for the extra $6,000\u2014as we have learned by experience on other occasions.\nOn the other hand, the evidence shows that the Bel\u0153il had a steel hull and a wooden deck, that when examined by a marine diver, on the occasion of the removal operations, the deck was found to be heavily damaged but the hull seemed to be in good condition. Even Weir does not appear to have then dismissed from his mind the idea of an eventual interest for the owner to refloat the vessel for, at trial, he prompted the following answer:\u2014\nI may say that I offered to leave the slings underneath if the owner wanted to finish the job in calm, clear water, after it was entirely out of the current in nice, calm, dead water.\nAgain, uncontradicted evidence not only shows that the steel of the hull reduced to scrap had alone, according to the then prevailing market prices, a substantial value\u2014some $4,000 to $5,000\u2014but that there were, at that time, during the war, a great demand and a scarcity of barges. No attempt was made to sell the vessel in whole or in part. Nor does the evidence indicate that a sale, and much less the arguments now advanced to support the Respondent's contention, were even considered by the Department at the relevant time. Had there been a sale, Weir's opinion\u2014expressed at trial and formed \"by experience on other occasions\"\u2014might in the result have then been regarded as a successful speculation; but, in the particular circumstances of this case, it cannot amount to evidence adequately supporting the contention of the Respondent that there was virtually nothing which could be sold and much less to evidence meeting this unqualified statutory provision: \"if there is nothing which can be sold.\"\nThis conclusion dispenses with the necessity of considering what consequence the submission of the Respondent would have in law had it been proved in fact.\nApplying the test suggested by Sir Lyman in the Anderson case, I cannot conclude that the facts established in this case clearly fall within the statutory description of the conditions of this new liability.\nThe action of the Respondent should be dismissed, the two appeals should be maintained with costs before this Court and the Exchequer Court.\nAppeals maintained with costs.\nSolicitor for Sauvageau: L\u00e9on M\u00e9thot.\nSolicitor for Price Navigation Co.

Where however, as in the case at bar, the infant and both of his parents are citizens of a friendly State in which they are all domiciled and have always resided, and when the Courts of the country to which he belongs and from which he has been improperly removed, have reached a decision that one of the parents is to have custody, and the other parent in breach of his agreement not to remove the infant from the country to which the infant belongs, and in defiance of, and solely for the purpose of evading the order of the Courts of that country, to which he had himself submitted the question of custody, brings such infant into Ontario, any jurisdiction an Ontario Court may have acquired as the result of such conduct should be exercised only for the purpose of returning the child in proper custody to the country whose subject he is.\nIn re B\u2014\u2019s Settlement [1940] 1 Ch. 54, distinguished, and questioned.\nPer: Taschereau, Kellock and Fauteux JJ., dissenting: The appellant under the guise of custody proceedings asks for an order for which there is no authority outside the Extradition Act or the deportation provisions of the Immigration Act. Even if it could be said such authority resides in the executive, it has not been committed to the courts. Atty.-Gen. for Canada v. Cain [1906] A.C. 542 at 546.\nThere is no jurisdiction in the Courts of Ontario or in this Court to make such an order as the appellant seeks or to do otherwise than apply to the circumstances of this case the ordinary law of Ontario as to custody, giving due weight to the California decree. Whatever the position of the respondent, the infant is entitled to rely upon the protection of the court and the law of Ontario relating to infants. To grant what the appellant seeks would be to ignore these rights. Re Gay, 59 O.L.R. 40; Re Ethel Davis, 25 O.R. 579.\nThe courts below correctly applied the relevant law, gave proper weight to the California judgment, and the judgment in appeal should not be disturbed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Robertson, C.J.O., dissenting[1], dismissing an appeal from an Order of Wells J.[2], made in habeas corpus proceedings, awarding custody of the infant child of the parties to the respondent.\nA.G. Slaght, K.C. and Peter Slaght, for the appellant.\nG.H. Lochead and G.A. MacKay, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Estey, Locke and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an appeal from an Order of Wells J., made in habeas corpus proceedings, awarding the custody of Terry Alexander McKee, an infant child of the parties, to the respondent.\nThe appellant is the mother and the respondent is the father of the infant. The respondent is an airlines executive and has been for more than thirty-three years an attorney of the State of Michigan. The appellant and the respondent are American citizens. They were both born in the United States of America and, until the respondent came to Ontario in December 1946 in the circumstances to be mentioned hereafter, had always lived there. They were married in Vermont in 1933. The infant was born in the State of California on the 14th of July 1940. The parties separated in December, 1940 and have not resided together since that date. Under date of the 4th of September 1941, the parties executed an agreement which is referred to in the proceedings as a property settlement agreement. This agreement does not make specific reference to the question of the custody of the infant, but it contains the following paragraph:\nIt is further understood and agreed that neither of the parties hereto shall remove TERRY ALEXANDER McKEE, son of the parties hereto, from or out of the United States of America without the written permission of the Party not so removing, or wishing to remove said boy from the United States of America.\nOn September 18, 1941 the appellant commenced an action for divorce in the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the county of Los Angeles. The respondent entered a cross-complaint for divorce. After a trial which occupied sixteen days and concluded on November 20, 1942, the Honourable Thurmond Clarke delivered judgment on December 17, 1942 dismissing the appellant\u2019s complaint and granting the respondent a divorce on his cross-complaint. This judgment awarded the custody of the infant to the respondent, but directed that the infant should spend three months each summer with the appellant. The judgment also affirmed and approved the agreement above referred to. It was conceded before us that this judgment was valid, and that the Court had jurisdiction to pronounce it.\nSubsequently, there were applications by both parties to the Superior Court of the State of California for modification of this Order and certain minor modifications were made.\nIn May, 1945, the respondent made an application to the same Court in California in the proceedings in which the order of December 17, 1942 as to custody had been pronounced, asking for a modification of the terms of that order as to custody. The appellant delivered a cross-application and the two applications were heard together before the Honourable Ruben S. Schmidt in June 1945. The hearing occupied five days. By order, dated August 1, 1945, the previous orders of the Court were modified to provide that full custody of the infant be awarded to the appellant with the right of reasonable visitation allowed to the respondent. It appears that the infant was not in the State of California in May 1945 when the application for modification was commenced by the respondent, but was in that State while the hearing was proceeding. The order of August 1, 1945 permitted the respondent to have the infant in Port Austin, Michigan until September 1, 1945, on which date it was ordered that the infant be delivered to the appellant in Los Angeles, California. From this order, the respondent appealed to the District Court of Appeals in California and the appeal was dismissed in November 1946. The respondent applied for a re-hearing which was denied, and then applied for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of California and this application was denied on the 23rd of December 1946. Evidence was given that under the laws of the State of California these appeals had the effect of staying the operation of the order of August 1, 1945 until the filing of a remittitur, following their final disposition. In the result the order of August 1, 1945 did not become effective until the 13th day of January 1947, so that the infant continued to be in the custody of the respondent except that he spent three months with the appellant during the summer of 1946.\nOn or about the 24th of December 1946 the respondent who was then residing with the infant at Port Austin, Michigan, received word that his final appeal had failed, and he thereupon proceeded with the child into the Province of Ontario. He did this without the permission or knowledge of the appellant. The appellant was not able to discover the whereabouts of the respondent and the infant until sometime in the month of February 1947. She then instituted habeas corpus proceedings in the Supreme Court of Ontario seeking to have the infant delivered to her. Her application was supported by her own affidavit setting out the relationship of the parties, the place and date of the infant\u2019s birth, the delivery of the judgment of the Honourable Ruben Schmidt, and the denial of the respondent\u2019s appeal. The affidavit further stated that on or about the 24th day of December 1946, the respondent without any knowledge or consent on the part of the appellant and with intent to deprive her of the lawful custody of the infant had brought him to the city of Kitchener and was there detaining him. A copy of the judgment of the Honourable Ruben Schmidt was made an exhibit to this affidavit.\nA Writ of habeas corpus was issued on 21st March 1947 pursuant to the Order of Treleaven J., and the return came before Smily J. on the 25th day of March, 1947.\nBy way of return to the Writ, the respondent filed a lengthy affidavit. In this he stated that at the date of his marriage to the appellant he was domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State of Michigan and had continued to be domiciled and ordinarily resident there until December 1946 when he had moved to Ontario, and that he intended to make his permanent home in Ontario. He made numerous allegations reflecting on the character of the appellant. He questioned her fitness to have the custody of the infant and stated that in his opinion it was better for the infant to be in his custody than in that of the appellant. He claimed that the order of the California Court of the 1st of August 1945 was made without jurisdiction, and would not be enforceable in the State of Michigan. As pointed out by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, the affidavit contained no denial of the statement in the appellant\u2019s affidavit that the respondent without any knowledge or consent on her part and with intent to deprive her of the lawful custody of the infant had brought him to the city of Kitchener.\nSmily J., reserved the matter and on 2nd April 1947 gave judgment directing the trial of an issue. The question directed to be tried was \u201cWho is to have the custody of the infant, Terry Alexander McKee, as between the said Evelyn McKee and the said Mark T. McKee?\u201d This order did not in terms refer the final disposition of the proceedings on the Writ of habeas corpus to the judge trying the issue as it might have done under the provisions of Rule 233. An intention to so refer the matter may perhaps be implied from the term in the order providing that the costs of the motion for the Writ of habeas corpus and of the hearing before Smily J., should be disposed of by the Judge trying the issue. Wells J., before whom the issue came on for trial, proceeded as if the final determination of the whole matter had been referred to him. I do not think it necessary to decide whether the practice which was followed was technically correct. I agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that, the matters in dispute having been fully investigated on the merits, no technical defect in procedure should now be allowed to render the proceedings abortive.\nOn behalf of the appellant it was urged before Wells J., as it had been before Smily J., that in view of the facts as to the citizenship, domicile and residence of the parties set out above, and as the custody of the infant had been awarded to her by the Courts of California after a full hearing in proceedings instituted by the respondent, and as it was obvious that the respondent had brought the infant to Ontario to avoid compliance with the order of the Court whose jurisdiction he had himself invoked, custody of the infant should be given to her. Wells J., however, was of the view that he was bound by authority to investigate the whole matter at length and to reach a determination as to what, in his view, would be in the best interests of the infant without being in any way bound by the California judgment, although, as he expressed it, that judgment was entitled to be given the greatest weight.\nThe trial before Wells J., occupied eleven days. Wells J., reserved judgment and later gave judgment awarding custody of the infant to the respondent, and giving the appellant the right of access once a week. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal, and the appeal was heard by Robertson C.J.O., Hogg, and Aylesworth JJ.A. The hearing of the appeal occupied six days. The appeal was dismissed, Robertson C.J.O. dissenting. The appellant then appealed to this Court.\nSome of the matters which were fully argued before us appear to present little difficulty. I think that there is no doubt that the Ontario Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the question as to which of the parties was entitled to the custody of the infant. Indeed, under the circumstances there was no way in which the appellant could obtain the custody of the infant who was in fact physically present in Ontario other than by application to the Ontario Courts. Counsel for the appellant did not question the jurisdiction of the Ontario Court, and there is nothing in the dissenting judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario to suggest that he entertained any doubt that such jurisdiction existed. The question to be determined is how a jurisdiction admittedly existing should have been exercised in this particular case.\nMuch argument was addressed to us and reference was made to many authorities on the question whether the judgment of the California Court of August 1, 1945 was binding upon and enforceable in the Courts of Ontario. I do not think it necessary to examine the authorities. I think they make it clear that the California judgment is not binding upon the Courts of Ontario in the sense that a judgment for payment of a sum certain in money pronounced by a foreign Court, which according to the rules of Private International Law recognized in Ontario had jurisdiction over the parties, will be enforced in an action brought on such judgment in the Courts of Ontario.\nIn my view, it was rightly held by Wells J., and the Court of Appeal that the judgment of a foreign Court as to the custody of an infant need not as a matter of binding obligation be followed in our Courts, although great weight must be given to it. For this reason it is in my opinion of little importance to discuss whether, according to the rules of Private International Law recognized by the Courts of Ontario, the Superior Court of California had jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment of August 1, 1945; because even if that Court had jurisdiction in such sense, its judgment would not be conclusive in our Courts but only of great persuasive effect.\nNo doubt in Ontario the well established general rule is that in all questions relating to the custody of an infant the paramount consideration is the welfare of the infant. In my respectful opinion, however, no case to which we were referred is authority for the proposition for which counsel for the respondent was forced to contend; that where, as in the case at bar, an infant and both of his parents are citizens of a friendly foreign State in which they all are domiciled and have always resided, when the question of such infant\u2019s custody has been fully litigated in the Courts of such State, and those Courts after full and careful hearings have reached a decision that one of the parents is to have custody, the other parent upon such decision being given, by the simple expedient of taking the child with him across the border into Ontario for the sole purpose of avoiding obedience to the judgment of the Court whose jurisdiction he himself invoked and in breach of his own agreement which had been ratified by such Court, becomes entitled as of right to have the whole question retried in our Courts, and to have them reach a new and independent judgment as to what is best for the infant.\nIt seems to me that to give effect to such an argument would bring about a state of confusion in matters of custody. It is now our duty after hearings in the Courts of this country which have consumed a total of twenty-two days to give the custody of this infant to one or other of the parties. If by our judgment we should approve the proposition set out above and the disappointed party should be able, by stealth or otherwise, to carry the child over the border into the Province of Manitoba, the courts of that Province would be bound by our judgment not to order that the child be handed back to the party to whom custody had just been awarded, unless and until, after reinvestigating the whole matter, as Wells J., did, from the time of the birth of the infant, they were of opinion that this was the course most likely to advance the infant\u2019s welfare. Such a result would mean that any parent, possessing ample financial means and sufficiently lacking in respect for the orders of the Courts and for his own undertakings, could, by moving from Province to Province prolong litigation as to an infant\u2019s custody until such infant attained his majority.\nI do not mean by anything that I have said that I disagree with the view expressed by Morton J., in re B\u2014\u2019s Settlement[3], that the Courts of this country are not bound blindly to follow the judgment of the Court of a foreign State as to the custody of an infant who is a citizen of such State. No doubt cases have arisen in the past and may arise in the future where it would be the duty of our Courts to refuse to follow what had been decided by the Courts of a foreign country as to the proper custody of an infant who is a subject of such foreign country. Nothing would, I think, be gained by suggesting examples of such cases. In my opinion the case at bar is not one of them.\nIt seems to me that the following considerations are sufficient to dispose the case at bar. The infant and both of his parents are citizens of the United States and have always lived in that country. By an agreement entered into between them, they covenanted that neither of them would remove the child from the United States without the consent of the other. This agreement was confirmed by the Courts of California in a judgment which both parties concede to be a valid one. The Courts of California in 1942 gave the custody of the infant to the respondent, but clearly did not regard the appellant as being an unfit person to have the custody of the child, as she was allowed custody during three months in each year. The Courts of the same State, in an application made by the respondent, in 1945, after a full hearing, came to the conclusion, not only that the appellant was a fit person to have the custody of the child, but that it was better for the child that she should have its custody than that it should be left in the custody of the respondent. It appears that in both of these judgments the welfare of the infant was regarded as of primary importance. The respondent does not appear to have suggested in any of the proceedings in the courts of the United States that it is to the advantage of the infant that he should reside and be brought up in Ontario rather than in the United States, the country of which he is a citizen and in which his future would seem to lie, except that up to the present in Ontario the respondent has been able to retain the infant in his custody. It is clear on the evidence that the respondent removed the child to Ontario without intending any benefit to the child, other than the supposed benefit which the child would derive from remaining in the custody of the respondent. Well J. did not find that the appellant is an unfit person to have the custody of the child. After reviewing the evidence including that as to the respondent\u2019s business interests and the material prospects of the child, the learned Judge reached the conclusion that the interests of the infant would be best served by leaving him where he is in the custody of the respondent, but there is nothing in his reasons or in the evidence to suggest that the welfare of the child would be endangered by his returning in the custody of his mother to his own country. Wells J., while observing on the practical difficulties of giving effect to such an order, directed that the mother should have access to the infant once a week.\nIt does not, I think, lie in the mouth of the respondent to suggest that the appellant is not a fit person to have the custody of the child, although he stoutly maintains his own greater fitness. This is shown, in my view, by the letter of the 25th of April, 1947 written by the respondent\u2019s solicitors to the solicitors for the appellant while the Ontario proceedings were pending, and which counsel for the respondent introduced in evidence before Wells J. This letter was written in an effort to bring about a settlement and one of the proposed terms was that the infant should spend the months of July and August in each year with the appellant \u201cat her home in California or at any other place where she may be from time to time,\u201d and that she should have the right of access to the infant at all reasonable times during the remainder of the year.\nIf this litigation had arisen between persons and in respect of a child who had a normal and bona fide residence in Ontario, and a trial judge had reached the conclusion that on weighing up the various advantages and disadvantages it was on the whole more beneficial for the infant to remain with one parent, and this finding had been affirmed by the Court of Appeal, we should, I think, be very hesitant to disturb it. In my opinion however, the matter should be very differently approached when it is obvious that one of the parties has brought the child into this Province in the final moments of a protracted litigation in his own country for the purpose of avoiding obedience to the judgment of its Courts, and in deliberate disregard of his own agreement.\nI think there is no difference in principle on the facts of this case from the case, suggested in argument, of a citizen of the United States fleeing that country on the day that a judgment as to custody was pronounced against him, bringing the infant with him and being served with a writ of habeas corpus issued in Ontario on the following day. There was no avoidable delay on the part of the appellant in invoking the aid of the Ontario Courts. The delay which did occur was caused by her inability to discover the whereabouts of the respondent and the infant.\nEven apart from these considerations, I would think it gravely doubtful whether the order now in appeal is one which is really for the benefit of the infant. In view of the attitude of the respondent, as shown by his conduct, it would have the effect of virtually exiling the infant from his own country during his minority. It would make it substantially impossible for him to spend any time with his mother, with whom he has spent part of every year since his birth up until the year 1947. I respectfully agree with the views expressed by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario when after discussing the cases of Hope v. Hope[4], re Harding[5] and Nugent v. Vetzera[6], he says:\nThe facts of the present case call much more strongly than did the facts of any of the cases I have cited for the question of the custody of the infant being left to the Courts of the country to which he belongs, and from which he has been improperly removed.\nand further where he says:\nI cannot too strongly state my opinion that there is grave impropriety in upholding in the Courts of Ontario a claim made to the custody of an infant who is the subject of a neighbouring and friendly country, by one who has brought the infant into this Province in breach of his agreement not to remove the infant from the country to which the infant belongs, and in defiance of, and solely for the purpose of evading the order of the Courts of that country, to which Court respondent had himself submitted the question of custody. Any jurisdiction to deal with the infant that an Ontario Court may have acquired as the result of such conduct, it should exercise only for purpose of returning the child, in proper custody, to the country whose subject he is.\nThere is no appeal before us from the order of Smily J., but because similar cases may arise in the future I desire, with the greatest respect, to express my opinion that that learned judge should not, in the circumstances of this case as disclosed in the material before him, have directed an issue but should have directed that the child be delivered into the custody of the appellant on her undertaking to return with him to her home in the United States.\nI think it desirable to say a few words in regard to the judgment of Morton J., in re B\u2014\u2019s Settlement, supra. Counsel for the respondent relied upon this case as supporting the judgment in appeal, and laid particular stress on the following passage, which appears to have been approved by the majority of the Court of Appeal in the case at bar:\nIn my view, under s. 1 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1925, I am bound to consider first the welfare of the infant, and to treat his welfare as being the paramount consideration. In so doing, I ought to give due weight to any views formed by the Courts of the country whereof the infant is a national. But I desire to say quite plainly that in my view this Court is bound in every case, without exception, to treat the welfare of its ward as being the first and paramount consideration, whatever orders may have been made by the Courts of any other country. If there are any observations in the two cases cited (Nugent v. Vetzera[7], and Di Savini v. Lousada[8]) which state or imply a contrary view, these observations ought not, in my view, to be followed at the present day.\nIn my view the facts in that case are dissimilar from those in the case at bar. The following important differences may be noted. In that case, the mother of the infant was before her marriage a British national. Following divorce proceedings in Belgium she had returned to live in England, and had a bona fide residence there. The order of the Belgian Court granting custody to the father was an interlocutory order. Morton J., laid emphasis on this fact, and stated that he did not know how far, if at all, the matter had been considered by that Court on the footing of what was best for the child or whether it had been regarded as a matter of course that the father being the guardian by the common law of Belgium and the only parent in Belgium, should be awarded custody. This interlocutory order was made on October 5, 1937 at which time the child was apparently already in England, but was not served upon the mother until December 6, 1938, more than a year after it was made. There was no agreement between the parties that the child should not be removed from Belgium. While the report does not set out the findings of fact made by Morton J., and we are left to speculate as to their precise nature, they were such as to move that learned Judge to say: \u201cAt the moment my feeling is very strong that even assuming in the father\u2019s favour, that there is nothing in his character or habits which would render him unfit to have the custody of the child, the welfare of the child requires in all the circumstances as they exist that he should remain in England for the time being.\u201d Morton J. laid considerable stress on the wording of Section 1 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1925, which differs substantially from that of the corresponding section of the Infants Act of Ontario.\nThe judgment of Morton J. has been the subject of some comment and criticism (See the Journal of Comparative Legislation and International Law, Vol. 22 Third Series, page 234; 21 British Year Book of International. Law pages 204-205; 4 Modern Law Review page 64 and Cheshire on Private International Law 3rd Edition (1947) pages 537 and 538). In Schmitthoff on Conflict of Laws (1945 at page 285, the judgment is treated as one explaining and depending upon the terms of Section 1 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1925, referred to above. While, I think that, on the facts, this case is clearly distinguishable from the case at bar, I think it desirable to state my opinion that the proposition laid down in the passage quoted above should not be held to state the law of Ontario applicable to such a case as the one now before us.\nI venture to think that neither Wells J., nor the majority of the Court of Appeal attached sufficient importance to the agreement between the parties providing that the child should not be removed from the United States without the consent of both parties. This agreement appears to me to be reasonable as between the parties and in the best interests of the child. As mentioned, it received the approval of the Superior Court in California in a judgment admitted to be valid. I do not think that any case was made out to warrant the Court sanctioning what the learned trial judge properly describes as an obvious and flagrant breach of this agreement on the part of the respondent. I do not find anything in the record to suggest that it was to the advantage of the infant that he should be taken out of the United States of America.\nIn the result, in my opinion, the appeal should be allowed and an order should be made, reciting the undertakings given by the appellant at the hearing that she will forthwith return with the infant, Terry Alexander McKee, to the United States of America and will keep the respondent fully advised as to his whereabouts and directing that the appellant do have the custody of the said infant and that the respondent do deliver the said infant into the custody of the appellant at the Office of the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Ontario at Osgoode Hall, Toronto, on Wednesday the 14th day of June 1950 between the hours of 10 and 11 o\u2019clock in the forenoon, Eastern Standard Time.\nNo doubt the respondent should be allowed reasonable access to the infant, but I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by our seeking to define in this order the terms on which such access shall be had. The primary purpose of the proposed order is that the infant may be taken back to his own country, from which, in my opinion, he ought never to have been removed. No doubt, if the parties cannot agree, the Courts of his own country will make whatever order appears desirable as to access. No reference to access should be made in the formal order of the Court.\nThe appellant should have her costs throughout, including the costs of the motion to quash the appeal to this Court, the issue and service of the Writ of habeas corpus, the proceedings before Smily J., the issue and execution of the Commission or Commissions to take evidence, and any interlocutory proceedings the costs of which have not already been disposed of other than the appellant\u2019s motion to this Court for an order extending the time for completing the appeal as to which there should be no order as to costs. In taxing the costs of the motion to quash, consideration should be given to the fact that at the time that motion was launched the respondent was entitled to move on the ground of delay in completing the appeal.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Kellock and Fauteux JJ., dissenting, was delivered by\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014The appellant seeks to set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming the judgment at trial of Wells J. dismissing her application for judgment awarding her the custody of the infant here in question as against the respondent, the husband and father. Counsel for the appellant, in his argument before this Court, rested his case primarily upon (1) a judgment of the Superior Court of the State of California, dated the 1st of August, 1945, and (2) an agreement of the 4th of December, 1941, made after the parties had separated, in paragraph 5 of which it was agreed that neither of the parties would remove the infant in question out of the United States without the written permission of the other. The findings of the learned trial judge as to where the interests and welfare of the child lay were not and could not, in my opinion, be seriously challenged. The position of the appellant is that, because the parties to the proceedings and the infant are citizens of the United States of America and were domiciled and resident therein at all times prior to December, 1946, when the respondent brought his son to Ontario (it is said to avoid the effect of the California judgment affirmed on or about the 23rd of December, 1946, but not effective prior to the 13th of January, 1947), the courts of Ontario, as a matter of comity, ought not to exercise their jurisdiction over the infant further than to ensure his return to \u201chis own country.\u201d The actual order which the appellant seeks is one awarding her the custody of the infant on her undertaking that she will forthwith return with him to the United States, and its primary purpose is not that it should be made from the standpoint of the welfare of the child, but merely to effect his removal from Ontario, not necessarily to California, but to one of the states of the Union. The question, therefore, which lies at the threshold of this case is as to whether the courts of Ontario, in the circumstances of this case, have a discretion enabling them in effect simply to deport the child, or whether they must apply the ordinary law of Ontario relating to custody of children.\nIt is not irrelevant to observe at the outset that the contention put forward on the part of the appellant involves an effect being given to the California judgment which would appear to be beyond the effect which, as stated in Ruling Case Law, vol. 9, page 477, sec. 293, would be given to it, in the circumstances here present, in any of the states of the Union even under the full faith and credit clause of the federal constitution of the United States. The authors there point out that the authorities in the United States are in conflict as to the extraterritorial effect of a judgment awarding the custody of the children upon the divorce of the parents (which is the type of judgment in question in the case at bar), some cases holding that, while the judgment is res judicata in the state of its rendition and elsewhere so far as the parents are concerned, it is not res judicata as to the right of some other state where the children may subsequently be to determine the custody of the children as their welfare may require, while other authorities sustain the proposition that where a decree of divorce fixing the custody of the children of the marriage is rendered in accordance with the laws of another state by a court of competent jurisdiction, such decree will be given full force and effect in other states so long as the circumstances attending the adoption of the decree remain the same. According to the above text, it is clear on the authorities that, whatever may be the ruling adopted, a foreign decree or order of the character under consideration is not a bar to a subsequent proceeding looking to its modification because of altered conditions since the time of its rendition, where such altered conditions make modification desirable and for the better welfare of the child. A glance at some of the authorities is instructive.\nIn Re Bort[9], the parents were divorced in Wisconsin where they both resided, the father being awarded custody of the children. Pending the proceedings, the wife removed the children to Kansas where the father took habeas corpus proceedings invoking the Wisconsin judgment and the full faith and credit clause of the federal constitution. The judgment of the court was given by Brewer J., later a member of the United States Supreme Court, who pointed out that the claim of the petitioner appeared to rest on the assumption that parents have some property rights in the possession of their children, which doctrine had been repudiated by the courts of Massachusetts. The Court did not put its judgment on that basis, however, but proceeded on the basis that as between the parents, the Wisconsin judgment was a finality, but that\nWe undersand the law to be, when the custody of children is the question, that the best interest of the children is the paramount fact. Rights of father and mother sink into insignificance before that * * * In a divorce suit the court is limited to the question: which of the two parents is the better custodian of the children? The decision only determines the rights of the parties inter se. But in this proceeding the question is: What do the best interests of the children require?\nIn People ex. rel. Allen v. Allen[10], the wife commenced an action for divorce in the Supreme Court of Illinois in which the husband appeared. In the course of the proceedings, the latter was enjoined from keeping the children of the marriage out of the state until the further order of the court. The judgment in the action awarded the custody to the mother who subsequently took habeas corpus proceedings in New York to obtain custody of the children. It was found as a fact that when the parties separated, custody of the children remained by agreement with the father upon the understanding that he would not remove them from Illinois without giving the mother notice of his intention so to do and an opportunity to visit them. This undertaking had been violated by the defendant. In the course of his judgment, Haight J. said at page 620:\nTo our mind, the Constitution covers the question under consideration, and it is our duty to give full faith and credit to the decree of the Illinois court. We do not, however, regard the decree of that court as binding upon the infants, but it is binding upon the parents, the parties to the action. The infants at the time, being of such tender years as to be unable to choose for themselves as to their custodian, became the wards of the court, and it was the duty of the court to choose for them. The court, in choosing for them, was required to consider the best interest and welfare of the children. Its decision became binding upon the children only for the time being, and as soon as the circumstances of the custodian changed, or other circumstances arose which would make it for the best interests of the children that there should be a change, it would be the duty of the court in which the decree was originally made, or of any court having jurisdiction, to make such change. But as between the parties to the action, the parents of the children, they are bound by the matters adjudged and determined in the action, and cannot again retry the question therein determined.\nUpon the merits, the mother was awarded custody.\nThe Court of Appeals dismissed an appeal of the father:\nFor the reason that the courts below, upon the view of all the existing facts related to the welfare and interests of the infants, exercised their discretion in awarding to the mother the custody of the children; and in so doing, gave to the Illinois decree not the force of an estoppel or the conclusive effect sometimes due to a judgment, but simply regarded it as a fact or circumstance bearing upon the discretion to be exercised without dictating or controlling it.\nIn Slack v. Perrine[11], the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia had to consider a judgment rendered in the Court of Chancery in New Jersey in proceedings instituted at a time when that court had jurisdiction over the parties, but during which proceedings the infants in question had been removed to Washington. The court held that the New Jersey court did not lose jurisdiction merely by the removal, and pointed out that otherwise the court of the District of Columbia itself would lose juris- diction if the children were again spirited away into another state where the same contention would be open. It was therefore held that the judgment of New Jersey was binding but its conclusive effect was limited to the parties. Insofar as the infants themselves were concerned, their rights could not be concluded or prejudiced by it, their welfare being the matter of paramount consideration at all times and under all circumstances.\nComing to the law of Ontario, it is worth noting at the outset, the position of an alien within the King\u2019s Dominions. In Johnstone v. Pedlar [12], Viscount Finlay said at page 273:\nThe subject of a State at peace with His Majesty, while permitted to reside in this country, is under the King\u2019s protection and allegiance * * *\nAt page 274:\nPrima facie the subject of a State at peace with His Majesty is, while resident in this country, entitled to the protection accorded to British subjects * * *\nViscount Cave, 276:\nBut so long as he remains in this country with the permission of the Sovereign, express or implied, he is a subject by local allegiance with a subject\u2019s rights and obligations.\nLord Sumner, page 291:\nAs soon as it is found to be settled, as the law of our Courts, that they are open to aliens as well as to subjects, I think it follows that they are presumably equally open, to them so far, that is, as actions are brought in support of such civil rights as are recognized in aliens from time to time.\nLord Phillimore, at page 296:\nBut an alien ami is never exlex, he is never subject to the arbitrary dispositions of the King. His rights may be limited, but whatever rights he has he can enforce by law just as an ordinary subject can. That is, I believe, both international law and the law of this country. No trace of any other doctrine is to be found in the text books, or in decided cases. The alien ami, once he is resident within the realm, is given the same rights for the protection of his person and property as a natural born or naturalized subject.\nAt page 297:\nFrom the moment of his entry into the country, the alien owes allegiance to the King till he departs from it, and allegiance, subject to a possible qualification which I shall mention, draws with it protection, just as protection draws allegiance. In Porter v. Freudenberg[13], Lord Reading C.J. said at page 869:\nAlien friends have long since been, and are at the present day, treated in reference to civil rights as if they were British subjects, and are entitled to the enjoyment of all personal rights of a citizen, including the right to sue in the King\u2019s Courts.\nAt page 883:\nOnce the conclusion is reached that the alien enemy can be sued, it follows that he can appear and be heard in his defence and may take all such steps as may be deemed necessary for the proper presentation of his defence. If he is brought at the suit of a party before a Court of justice he must have the right of submitting his answer to the Court. To deny him that right would be to deny him justice and would be quite contrary to the basic principles guiding the King\u2019s Courts in the administration of justice.\nThere is not, therefore, one law to be applied to an alien and another to a subject. Both are entitled to the protection of the same law. Appellant, in the present case, by taking proceedings here has invoked that law, and it is the respondent who is sued. As stated by Lord Reading in the case cited, at page 883:\n* * * he is entitled to have his case decided according to law, and if the judge in one of the King\u2019s Courts has erroneously adjudicated upon it, he is entitled to have recourse to another and an appellate Court to have the error rectified. Once he is cited to appear he is entitled to the same opportunities of challenging the correctness of the decision of the judge of first instance or other tribunal as any other defendant.\nIn Hope v. Hope[14], which was a proceeding as to custody, Lord Cranworth L.C., said at 346:\nThe reason why such a jurisdiction exists over foreign children in this country is, because foreign children, like adult foreigners, while here are to a certain extent the subjects of the Crown of England, and it has been decided that they are so for many purposes.\nAt page 347 he said:\nThere might be cases in which it would be improper that I should attempt to exercise it, as, for example, where both the parents should be abroad, and there should be no property here; * * * I should in all probability not make an order, because the parties would not be within my control, and they might disobey * * * But here it is to be observed that these circumstances do not exist. The father is within the jurisdiction; the mother, who though living at Paris yet is a party and has appeared * * * and she is therefore, for this purpose, within the jurisdiction, and a person, therefore, whom an order of this Court may reach; and being here, I am not to assume that she will disobey any order that may be made upon her. Therefore, I shall not abstain from making an order upon her merely because she happens to be residing at Paris. That no order could be made on a person abroad would be a dangerous principle to recognize in this country, where there are such facilities for travelling, and where a person may in a few hours get out of the jurisdiction by leaving almost any part of the kingdom, and as easily return again.\nSo far as the Courts of Ontario are concerned, their jurisdiction in matters relating to infants stems from R.S.O. 1897, c. 51, the relevant parts of which read as follows:\n26. The High Court shall also, subject as in this Act mentioned, have the like jurisdiction and powers as by the laws of England were on the 4th day of March, 1837, possessed by the Court of Chancery in England, in respect of the matters hereinafter enumerated, that is to say:\n* * *\n2. In all matters relating to * * * infants * * * and their estates.\n27. The rules of decision in the said matters in the last preceding section mentioned shall, except where otherwise provided, be the same as governed the Court of Chancery in England, in like cases on the 4th day of March, 1837.\n40. The High Court shall also have jurisdiction\u2014\n* * *\n3. In respect of * * * infants and their property and estates, as provided by the Act respecting . . . Infants.\n(Then R.S.O. 1897 cap. 168; now R.S.O. 1937 cap. 215).\nIt is well settled that where jurisdiction is conferred, the court is required, rather than merely permitted, to exercise it.\nIn The Queen v. Bishop of Oxford[15], Cockburn C.J. referred at page 259 to what had been said by Jervis L.C.J. in MacDougall v. Paterson[16], as follows:\nWhen a statute confers an authority to do a judicial act in a certain case, it is imperative on those so authorized to exercise the authority when the case arises, and its exercise is duly applied for by a party interested and having the right to make the application.\nIn Re Gay[17], Middleton J.A., in delivering the judgment of the Appellate Division, said at page 43:\nThe Courts of this country must always exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon them in regard to the custody of infants within this jurisdiction, according to the laws of this country.\nIn Re Kinney[18], 6 P.R. 245, both parents of the infant there in question were not only citizens, but also resided in the State of Michigan. The child in question had been brought into Ontario for temporary purposes by the husband, and it was alleged by the wife that this had been done in order to place it beyond the jurisdiction of the courts of Michigan in which cross\u2011actions for divorce and custody were then pending between the parties. The proceeding in the Ontario court was a habeas corpus proceeding instituted by the mother. After pointing out that the husband and wife were citizens of a foreign country and that their domicile, including that of the child, was foreign, Wilson J. said at 247:\nAnd in disposing of this matter I must determine the rights of the parties, and must make my judgment conform to the law which governs these rights, subject to the general principles of our own law. I must ascertain what the law of that country is as applicable to the contested rights before me, and so far adopt that law as part of our own internal law in determining these rights, subject, as before stated, to our own general principles of jurisprudence.\nThat which is involved in the present case is a matter of custody. The appellant, under the guise of custody proceedings, asks for an order for which there is no authority outside the Extradition Act or the deportation provisions of the Immigration Act. Even if it could be said that such authority resides in the executive, it has not been committed to the courts, Attorney-General for Canada v. Cain[19]. In my respectful opinion, there is no jurisdiction in the courts of Ontario or in this court to make such an order as the appellant seeks or to do otherwise than to apply to the circumstances of this case, the ordinary law of Ontario as to custody, giving due weight, of course, to the California decree.\nIt is always to be remembered that, whatever the position of the respondent, the infant itself is entitled to rely upon the protection of the court and the law of Ontario relating to custody of infants. In my opinion, to grant what the appellant asks would be to ignore these rights. No vestige of authority has been referred to to substantiate such a course.\nSince the case of Re Ethel Davis[20], which received the approval of the Appellate Division in Ontario in Re Gay (supra), it has been authoritatively determined that the motive of a person in coming to Ontario to avoid the results of an anticipated judgment as to custody does not enable the courts of Ontario to refuse to apply to such a case the ordinary law. The question then is as to what effect is to be given under the law of Ontario to a foreign decree dealing with the custody of children. That law was authoritatively laid down in the Appellate Division by Middleton J.A. in Re Gay, already cited, where, in approving of the previous decisions in Re E.[21], and Re Ethel Davis (supra), he said at page 42:\nThe kidnapping cases cited by Mr. Greene, e.g. Rex v. Hamilton[22], do not, as it seems to me, decide anything contrary to what is decided in Re Ethel Davis. They decide that when a child is in the custody of the parent to whose custody it has been confided by the court of the domicile of the parents, it is in lawful custody, so that it is an offence for the other parent to take it away, but they do not decide that if the parent to whom the custody has been awarded by the foreign court come to the Court in Ontario seeking the enforcement of the foreign judgment the Ontario Court is bound to lend him its aid, even if convinced that if it does so it will not be acting in the best interests of the child * * *\nThe foreign guardian has no absolute right as such under the judgment of the foreign court in this country. The decree of the foreign court is entitled to great weight in determining the proper custody here.\nAlso, upon a narrower principle I think the judgment of the Michigan court is not entitled to the effect given it by the judgment in review. It is not in itself, nor upon its face, final * * * No matter what the form, this is necessarily the case in all orders dealing with the custody of children\u2014they are not in their nature final. The Courts of this country must always exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon them in regard to the custody of infants within this jurisdiction according to the laws of this country * * *\nOwing to the course adopted in the court below, the question of the welfare of the infants and the conduct of the parents is not ripe for discussion. This must be determined by oral evidence, and the case is remitted to the Surrogate Court to be dealt with upon oral evidence and in accordance with the provisions of the statute (the Infants Act) to which reference has been made.\nIn Re Ethel Davis, the appellant, while formerly resident in Ontario, had gone to Buffalo, New York, in the year 1890. There the husband filed a declaration in 1891 in which he swore that it was his bona fide intention to become a citizen of the United States of America and to renounce forever all allegiance to Her Majesty. In February, 1892, his wife left him, taking with her the child in question, alleging drunkenness and neglect on his part. She lived apart from him with the children until July. 1893, when, during her absence, he possessed himself of the children and placed them in an orphanage in Buffalo. In September, 1893, she instituted proceedings for divorce in the Superior Court at Buffalo upon the ground of his adultery. He appeared in these proceedings and the court found all the material facts charged against him as true and granted the wife divorce and custody. Shortly before the judgment was pronounced on December 15, 1893, the husband left Buffalo, taking the infant in question with him into Ontario and it was expressly found by the learned trial judge, Street J., that this was done \u201cwith the apparent object of escaping the consequences of the impending judgment.\u201d The mother then came to Ontario and instituted habeas corpus proceedings. This was obviously very shortly after the judgment in the Buffalo court as the judgment in Ontario was pronounced on May 18, 1894.\nThe learned trial judge found that the father had gone to Buffalo intending to reside there permanently and that he was domiciled there. Accordingly, he held that the court in Buffalo had jurisdiction over the parties which it did not lose merely by reason of the father having left with the object of escaping the consequences of the anticipated judgment. He held however, that the foreign guardian had no absolute rights as such under the foreign judgment in Ontario, but the fact of her appointment by the Court in Buffalo was entitled to \u201cgreat weight in determining the proper custody here.\u201d On a consideration of all the circumstances, including the conduct of both spouses throughout, the learned judge held that the interests of the child lay in awarding custody to the mother.\nIn Re B\u2019s Settlement[23], the application for custody of the infant there in question was by the father, a Belgian national. The mother had been granted a divorce by the Belgian courts but the judgment was reversed and the father became entitled to custody by the common law of Belgium. The mother, who had gone to live in England, visited Belgium and was, by a stratagem, enabled to obtain possession of the infant in September, 1937, and took him to England. The father instituted divorce proceedings in Belgium and pending the proceedings, on October 5, 1937, was appointed guardian and given custody, the mother being ordered to return the infant within 24 hours of the service of the order on her, which order she did not obey. There was no question in this case, any more than in the case of Ethel Davis, but that the foreign court had jurisdiction over the parties. The father then came to England and applied for custody, the mother in the meantime having obtained an order making the infant a ward of the Court in England. In these circumstances, Morton J., at page 58 asked himself:\nFrom what angle ought I to approach the case, and how far is there any restriction imposed upon the course which I should take by reason of the order of the Divorce Court in Belgium of October 5, 1937, giving custody to the father?\nWith regard to the order of the Belgian Court, the learned judge said at page 62:\nI do not think it would be right for the Court, exercising its jurisdiction over a ward who is in this country, although he is a Belgian national, blindly to follow the order made in Belgium on October 5, 1937.\nThe learned judge was of the opinion that, since the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1925,\nWhatever may have been the position before the Act of 1925, this Court is always bound to exercise a judgment of its own when dealing with the custody of a ward. In my view, under section 1 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1925, I am bound to consider first the welfare of the infant, and to treat his welfare as being the paramount consideration. In so doing, I ought to give due weight to any views formed by the Courts of the country whereof the infant is a national.\nIn considering the weight to be attached to the judgment of the Belgian court the learned judge thought that he could not disregard the fact that it had been made nearly two years before, and he had to deal with the position as it existed at the end of that time. The learned trial judge in October, 1947, had also to deal with the situation existing over two years later than the California decree of May, 1945.\nIn Johnstone v. Beattie[24], the House of Lords had to consider an application for the appointment of an English guardian for a Scottish child which had been brought to England after the death of the father for a temporary purpose (see 9 H.L.C. at 464, per Lord Campbell). At the time of these proceedings the mother was also deceased. It was held that the Scottish guardians had no authority over the infant in England nor entitled to be confirmed or appointed in England.\nIn the course of his judgment, Lord Cottenham said at page 113:\nIt was urged, that the Court must recognize the authority of a foreign tutor and curator, because it recognizes the authority of the parent of a foreign child. This illustration proves directly the reverse; for, although it is true that the parental authority over such a child is recognized, the authority so recognized is only that which exists by the law of England.\nAnd at page 117:\nIt has been said that if the Court had jurisdiction, it ought not in this case, in its discretion, to have exercised it. This is not very intelligible to those who are accustomed to the proceedings in Chancery. It means, I presume, that the Court ought not to have interfered * * * In truth, however, independently of form, the doctrine of non-interference has no place in the case of an infant, for whose protection no legal right of guardianship in any person in this country exists * * * If there be a father living, or a guardian regularly appointed, (i.e. in England) the Court does not interfere, except to assist the father or guardian, unless in certain cases in which the misconduct of the father or guardian renders interference necessary for the protection of the child.\nAt page 84, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Lyndhurst, said:\nIt is proper that I should state, that according to the uniform course of the Court of Chancery\u2014which I understand to be the law of that Court, which has always been the law of that Court\u2014upon the institution of a suit of this description, the plaintiff, the infant, became a ward of the Court\u2014became such ward by the very fact of the institution of the suit; and being a ward of the Court, it was the duty of the Court to provide for the care and protection of the infant; and as the Court cannot itself personally superintend the infant, it appoints a guardian, who is an officer of the Court, for the purpose of doing that on behalf of the Court, and as the representative of the Court, which the Court cannot do itself personally. If there be a parent living within the jurisdiction of the Court, or if there be a testamentary guardian within the jurisdiction of the Court, the Court in that case does not interfere for the purpose of appointing a person to discharge the duty, which is imposed upon the Court itself, of taking care of the person of the infant; but the parent or the testamentary guardian is subject to the orders and control of the Court, precisely in the same way as an officer appointed by the authority of the Court, for the purpose of discharging the duties to which I have referred. I apprehend that is clearly the law of the Court of Chancery; and it has always been so, as far as I have been able to understand and comprehend.\nAt page 146 Lord Langdale said:\nAn infant whose whole property is alleged to be in Scotland, and whose tutors and curators are usually resident in Scotland, is now resident in England and entitled to the protection of the English laws . . . upon the bill being filed, the infant became a ward of the Court of Chancery; and at the same time it became the duty of the Court to protect her interests, or to see that they were duly protected.\nIn Stuart v. Bute[25], an infant had been removed to Scotland by one of two guardians appointed in England, who refused to return him, although ordered so to do by the court. Proceedings were then taken in Scotland for an order for delivery of the infant. With respect to the Scottish Court, Lord Campbell L.C. said at page 463:\nThe Court of Session had undoubted jurisdiction over the case. By their nobile officium, conferred upon them by their Sovereign as parens patriae, it is their duty to take care of all infants who require their protection, whether domiciled in Scotland or not. But I venture to repeat, what I laid down in this House nearly 20 years ago, \u201cthat the benefit of the infant which is the foundation of the jurisdiction must be the test of its right exercise.\u201d\nThe House came to the conclusion upon that principle that it was in the interests of the child that he should be delivered to the English guardian.\nIn Nugent v. Vetzera[26], cited by the learned Chief Justice in the court below, Austrian children had been sent to England for educational purposes and their guardians appointed by the Austrian court desired their return in accordance with a decree of that court. This was resisted by a married sister of the children with whom they lived in England. Page-Wood V.C. refused to interfere with the carrying out by the foreign guardian of the return of the infants to Austria. He refused however to discharge the order which had been made appointing guardians in England and it is significant that in the course of his judgment he was careful to say that the right of the foreign guardian should not be interfered with\nexcept on some grounds which I do not think it necessary to specify, guarding myself, however, against anything like an abdication of the jurisdiction of this Court to appoint guardians.\nThis was not the case of a parent in England desiring to keep his or her child there. Both parents were in fact deceased. The evidence on the part of the sister was directed merely to establishing that an English education was superior to an Austrian one, and that the children\u2019s mother in her lifetime had desired them to be brought up in England. There was no question raised as to the interests of the children from the standpoint of the suitability of the foreign guardian to have their custody or from the standpoint of their health or well-being. Had questions of that sort been disregarded, the decision could not stand with the decisions of the House of Lords already referred to. In the case at bar, the appellant in effect invites the court to shut its eyes to everything except the foreign judgment and the agreement already referred to, because the parties are aliens\u2014in effect to abdicate its ordinary jurisdiction, a thing Page-Wood V.C. in the case last mentioned carefully guarded himself against doing.\nIn M\u2019Lean v. M\u2019Lean[27], the proceedings were between a father domiciled in Scotland and a mother living in England, the children being with the latter, who had taken proceedings in the Court of Chancery in England.\nLord Justice-Clerk (Cooper) at page 84 said:\nBefore considering what exactly we should do, it is worth recalling that, since these three children are de facto resident outside the jurisdiction of this Court, any order that we might pronounce could only be made effective by invoking the aid of the Court of Chancery; and I should imagine that the Court of Chancery would treat our decision with every consideration and respect but would independently examine the matter from their own standpoint before lending their authority to the enforcement of our order. That is certainly the attitude which this Court would adopt in the converse case. we are not concerned with the relative superiority or inferiority of the rival claims of the two spouses to custody except from one point of view, namely, the welfare of the children, which is the primary and paramount consideration by reference to which our judgment must be guided.\nLord Jamieson at page 90 referred to the decision of Morton J. in B\u2019s Settlement[28], and said:\n* * * the Court whose assistance is invoked will not just blindly give that assistance, but will first be satisfied, giving of course due weight and consideration to that order made, that such is in the best interests of the child.\nIn my opinion, the result of all the authorities is correctly summed up in the 3rd Edition of Cheshire at page 539, where the author says:\nThe cases already discussed show that whether the foreign guardian shall be allowed to exert his personal authority, as, for example, by removing the ward from England, is conditioned solely by what the Court considers is most calculated to promote the welfare of the infant.\nIn Re Harding[29], Orde J.A., giving the judgment of the court, after referring to Re Gay (supra), said at 520:\nWhat was held there was that, whatever the jurisdiction of a foreign court might be over infants within this province, our courts had jurisdiction over them by reason of their being within this Province.\nIn Johnstone v. Beattie (supra), Lord Cottenham said at 114:\n* * * it has before been shown that the rights and duties of a foreign tutor and curator cannot be recognized by the Courts of this country, with reference to a child residing in this country. The result is that such foreign tutor and curator have no right, as such, in this country; and this so necessarily follows from reason, and from the rules which regulate, in this respect, the practice of the Court of Chancery, that it could not be expected that any authority upon the subject would be found.\nIn Woodworth v. Spring[30], Bigelow C.J. said with respect to the status of a foreign guardian of an infant, at 323:\nHe (the child) is now lawfully within the territory and under the jurisdiction of this commonwealth, and has a right to claim the protection and security which our laws afford to all persons coming within its limits, irrespective of their origin or of the place where they may be legally domiciled\u2026 The question whether a person within the jurisdiction of a state can be removed therefrom depends, not on the laws of the place whence he came or in which he may have his legal domicil, but on his rights and obligations as they are fixed and determined by the laws of the state or country in which he is found * * *\nEven the parental relation, which is everywhere recognized, will not be deemed to carry with it any authority or control beyond that which is conferred by the laws of the country where it is exerted. At page 325 he said:\nIt would not do to say that a foreign guardian has no claim to the care or control of the person of his ward in this commonwealth. If such were the rule, a child domiciled out of the state, who was sent hither for purposes of education, or came within the state by stealth, or was brought here by force or fraud, might be emancipated from the control of his rightful guardian, duly appointed in the place of his domicil, and thus escape or be taken out of all legitimate care and custody. But in such cases, the foreign guardian would not be regarded here as a stranger or intruder. His appointment in another state as guardian of an infant, with powers and duties similar to those which are by our laws vested in guardians over the persons of their wards, would entitle him to ask that the comity of friendly states having similar laws and usages should be so far recognized and exerted as to surrender to him the infant, so that he might be again restored to his full rights and powers over him, by removing him to the place of his domicil. And if it should appear that such surrender and restoration would not debar the infant from any personal rights or privileges to which he might be entitled under our laws, and would be conducive to his welfare and promote his interests, it would be the duty of the court to award to the foreign guardian the custody of the person. This is the doctrine substantially stated by Lord Langdale in Johnstone v. Beattie, ubi supra, and confirmed in a subsequent judgment in the case of Stuart v. Moore, in the House of Lords, as reported in 4 Law Times (N.S.) 382.\nAt 326:\nThe result is, that neither of the parties to the present proceeding can assert or maintain an absolute right to the permanent care and custody of the infant who is now before the court. But it is for this court to determine, in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion, having regard to the welfare and permanent good of the child as a predominant consideration, to whose custody he shall be committed.\nWith respect to the term of the agreement between the appellant and the respondent that the child should not be removed outside the United States without consent, it is worth noting that, while under the judgment of the California court of the 17th of December, 1942, granting the respondent\u2019s petition for divorce against the appellant and awarding him custody of the infant with the provision that the latter should spend three months in the summer with the appellant, the separation agreement of 1941 (referred to in the judgment as a \u201cproperty settlement\u201d) was confirmed, at the same time it was provided that during the above-mentioned three months the child should not be removed from California without the consent of the court. In my opinion, there is a great deal to be said for the view that the confirmation of the \u201cproperty settlement\u201d by the above judgment was limited to the property provisions of that agreement which were substantial, and that it was not intended that such confirmation should extend to the provisions of paragraph 5. It would appear somewhat difficult to contend that the judgment confirmed the agreement that neither party should remove the child from the United States without the consent of the other, and therefore authorized each to have the child anywhere within the Union, and at the same time restrained the appellant from removing the child outside the State of California during the only period of the year when the appellant was at all entitled to have the child with her. It seems a contradiction, therefore, to say that the agreement and therefore paragraph 5 was confirmed by the judgment which itself altered the provisions of that paragraph as against one of the parties.\nHowever that may be, I do not think that under the law applicable in the Province of Ontario, such an agreement, even with the confirmation of a judgment, is to be given any greater effect than a foreign judgment itself, and I have already dealt with that matter. The agreement is a fact for the consideration of the court in determining that which is in the best interests of the child. In Re Armstrong[31], Middleton J., as he then was, held that\nwhere the welfare of the infant was concerned, that consideration was paramount; and no agreement by the parents could absolve the Court from considering the infant\u2019s welfare.\nSection 1 subsection (1) of The Infants Act, R.S.O. 1937, 215, provides that the court, in making an order as to custody and the right of access thereto of the other party, shall have\nregard to the welfare of the infant, and to the conduct of the parents, and to the wishes as well of the mother as of the father, and may alter, vary or discharge the order on the application of either parent.\nBy section 2 subsection (2), it is provided that, unless otherwise ordered by the court, and subject to the provisions of this Act, the father and mother of an infant shall be joint guardians and shall be equally entitled to the custody, control and education of such infant. Subsection (2), which was not in force at the time of the decision in Re Armstrong (supra), provides that\nWhere the parents are not living together, or where the parents are divorced or judicially separated, they may enter into a written agreement as to which parent shall have the custody, control and education of such infant, and in the event of the parents failing to agree, either parent may apply to the court for its decision.\nThis provision, of course, has nothing to do with an agreement as to a country where an infant is to be kept. It relates to agreements as to custody and if, inferentially, the separation agreement of 1941 is to be regarded as giving the custody to the mother because of the provision for payment by the respondent to the appellant of $125 per month in respect of the infant, that agreement has been already set aside by the judgment of 1942 which awarded custody to the respondent and permitted the appellant to have the child for three months only in each year.\nIn any event, it was pointed out by Rose J., as he then was, in Re Allen[32], after the statute had taken its present form, that the amendments of 1923 left untouched the provisions of section 3, namely,\nIn questions relating to the custody and education of infants, the rules of equity shall prevail. At page 102, that learned judge also said:\nAs a result of the amending Act (the amendment being embodied in sections 1 and 2 of the present Act) the Court in this case must concern itself, as heretofore, primarily with the welfare of the infant * * *\nThis judgment was affirmed on appeal, 36 O.W.N. 222. In Re Plewes[33], also, Robertson C.J.O. at 480, after referring to the amendments, said:\nThe rules of equity continue to prevail. The welfare of the child is still the paramount consideration * * *\nI do not think that section 2 of the statute goes any farther than to authorize an agreement between parents living apart as to the custody of their children, which prior to that statute might have been void on grounds of public policy as explained by Lord Romily M.R. in Hamilton v. Hector[34].\nIn my opinion, the bringing of the infant to Ontario, notwithstanding the agreement, is one fact in the respondent\u2019s conduct which the court should take into consideration in determining his fitness to have the custody of the child, but as stated by Rose J. in Re E (supra) at 536, the matter to be determined is \u201cnot the proprietary right of either of the contending parties, but the order that ought to be made regarding the custody of the infant, having regard to his welfare and to the conduct of the parents and to the wishes as well of the mother as of the father,\u201d as provided by the statute. This is the uniform ratio of all the authorities, domestic and foreign, which I have been able to find, and the situation is the same, even where a provision against removal is contained in the judgment. In Hardin v. Hardin[35], the court said:\nThe alleged misconduct of appellee in removing the child from the State of Kentucky beyond the jurisdiction of the McLean circuit court, without its consent or authority, did not in any manner enlarge the right of appellant under the judgment or decree thereof in respect to the custody of the child, but possibly subjected her to be dealt with by such court as in contempt of its authority.\nAgain, in Joab v. Sheets[36], the court said at 332:\nThe alleged misconduct of the appellee in having disregarded, and in planning for the further disregard of some of the provisions in the decree of divorce, concerning the custody of the child, might have afforded some reason for the modification of, or some change in, those provisions in a direct proceeding to that end, but it did not of itself work a forfeiture of any of the appellee\u2019s rights or responsibilities under the decree. Conceding the truth of the alleged misconduct on her part, it made the appellee simply and only liable to an attachment for contemptuous disregard of the authority of the court granting the decree of divorce, and to be dealt with as is usual in similar cases of contempt for refusing to comply with orders of court.\nIn Thorndyke v. Rice[37], the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, in dealing with an agreement made after the parents had separated with respect to the custody of their child, said at 21:\nThen there is the agreement of the mother, voluntarily entered into by her, that the father should have his custody. This is of no binding force upon the court as an agreement, but it is evidence to show what the opinion of the mother was then as to the fitness of the father to have such custody.\nComing to the facts in the case at bar, the appellant and respondent were married in the year 1933, and after residing in the District of Columbia, the State of Wisconsin and the State of Michigan, they took up residence in Los Angeles in the year 1937. Both had had children of previous marriages. The child here in question, Terry, the only child of the marriage of the parties, was born on the 14th of July, 1940. In or about the month of December, 1940, a separation in fact took place, and on the 4th of September, 1941, the separation agreement already referred to was executed.\nAlmost immediately afterwards, the appellant commenced divorce proceedings in the Superior Court of Los Angeles and the respondent filed a cross-complaint asking similar relief against the appellant. Judgment was delivered on the 17th of December, 1942, the petition of the appellant being dismissed and judgment for divorce being granted in favour of the respondent, the appellant being found guilty of adultery. The respondent was awarded custody of the infant Terry and the provision already referred to was made in this judgment that the child should spend three months in each year with the appellant. It was also found by the judgment that the present respondent was a fit and proper person to have the care, custody and control of Terry; that he had a well-established and proper home in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and also one in Port Austin, Michigan; that he was able properly to care for said minor child at either of these two places, and that he was better able to provide for the proper raising and education of said minor child than the present appellant.\nFollowing this judgment the respondent took his son to his home in Milwaukee where he lived with all the members of his family who were not then grown up, excepting one daughter, Cynthia by name, who at all times has adhered to the appellant. During the residence in Milwaukee, which continued for about two years, the family also used the Michigan residence at Port Austin in the summer. In July, 1944, the respondent gave up his Milwaukee residence and removed to the Port Austin home.\nIn the meantime, the appellant continued through 1943, 1944 and 1945 with proceedings in the California action by way of applications for a new trial and for modification of the terms of the judgment of 1942 as to custody. In January, 1944, she also instituted custody proceedings against the respondent in the Wisconsin courts. In May, 1945, while the Wisconsin action was pending, respondent made application in the California action for an order eliminating the provision under which the child was to spend the three summer months with appellant. She thereupon made a further application by way of cross-proceeding for an order awarding her complete custody to the exclusion of respondent. This resulted on August 1, 1945, in the judgment now relied on by appellant, giving her complete custody.\nThe considerations which entered into the making of this order (which are of importance in considering the weight to be given to it) included such matters as the accessibility geographically of the Port Austin home, the inclemency of the weather, the fact that the care of the child there was left to aged employees of the respondent during the latter\u2019s frequent absences from home, and the lack of school facilities. There is no finding nor suggestion of any change in the fitness of the respondent to have the care or custody of his son, nor is there any suggestion that any consideration in the health of the child called for a change. The latter was then five years of age and was, contrary to the finding in the judgment, attending kinder- garten in the public school at Port Austin, a fact brought out in the present proceedings by counsel for the appellant.\nThe respondent appealed from this order and the appeal had the effect of a stay. Final judgment, as previously mentioned, was not given until some time in December, 1946, and under the law of California this did not become effective until the 13th of January, 1947. In the meantime, the respondent, shortly after learning of the judgment in December, left his home at Port Austin with the child and came to Kitchener in the Province of Ontario. In May, 1947, after completion of alterations to a house on a farm owned by the respondent near Kitchener, they took up residence there. The respondent says that he preferred to have his son go to a country school owing to the attention which the boy would receive in a larger centre by reason of the publicity given the present proceedings which the appellant had instituted. When the latter learned of the whereabouts of the respondent, she came to Kitchener toward the end of February, 1947, and commenced these proceedings on the 17th of March following.\nThe respondent\u2019s first wife had originally come from Waterloo county and many of her relatives are still there. The respondent had himself made a great many visits there over the years and in the fall of 1944 he purchased a farm in the county and later two adjoining farms which he operated together. It is on this property that he took up residence with his sister and son.\nIn my opinion, the learned trial judge determined the matter before him in accordance with the proper principles governing, and came to the conclusion on the evidence before him as to the proper custody of the child that the \u201cboy\u2019s best interests and welfare lie in leaving him in his father\u2019s custody and training.\u201d He found the attacks made upon the respondent by the appellant unfounded, and his conduct throughout that of an honest and upright man.\nIn weighing the effect to be given to the judgment of the California court, which I accept as having been given by a court having jurisdiction, the learned trial judge said:\n* * * on looking at the evidence before me and on giving the greatest weight to the California decision which I am naturally disposed to do because it results from a prolonged trial and a consideration of the issues between these parties by a court of superior jurisdiction which is entitled to great respect, I am still reluctantly compelled to disagree with the California court\u2019s decision and to take a contrary view as to the proper place for the custody of this child. As I apprehend the law in Ontario, even granting the validity of the California judgment of 1945, it is only one of the factors which I must consider and the over-riding factor which must guide me in my final decision is my view on the evidence of the welfare of the infant.\nIn considering the weight to be given to the judgment of 1945, it is to be observed that while it states that it appears to the court \u201cthat it is for the best interests and welfare of said minor child\u201d that he be placed in the custody of the appellant, the enumerated findings, even if accurate\u2014and at least one has been shown by the evidence in the case at bar to be inaccurate\u2014would not be considered sufficient grounds under the law of Ontario for changing the custody, there being no suggestion that the respondent has, since the decree of 1942, become unfit to have the custody of the infant, nor is there any reason given why the appellant, who was adjudged by that judgment to be unfit to have custody for the very adequate reasons given in that judgment, had by 1945 become fit. Giving due weight to the findings in the judgment of 1945, it is impossible, in my opinion, to overrule the decision in appeal on the concurrent findings of the courts below which weighed these findings in the light of all evidence adduced, particularly with respect to circumstances since the date of the 1945 judgment.\nIt is well to set out certain other parts of the judgment of the learned trial judge in which some of his findings are set forth, namely,\nLooking at the matter in a broad way, I think I must agree with Mr. Justice Smily who directed this issue, that in some respects circumstances have changed since the judgment of the courts of California in 1945. For one thing, this child is now seven instead of five years old. He is approaching an age when his father\u2019s guidance and assistance may well be of more assistance to him than that of his mother. Looking at the matter in a broad way and regarding Mr. McKee\u2019s business life and private life as I do, it is very hard to escape the conclusion that in any event and apart from Mrs. McKee\u2019s conduct, the boy\u2019s best interests and welfare lie in leaving him in his father\u2019s custody and training. During the course of Mr. McKee\u2019s cross-examination, a vigorous attempt, commencing with some of his father\u2019s business difficulties when he was fifteen years of age, was made to discredit him in respect of his public and business morals. There were even suggestions of private immorality, but in no case was anything established nor was any evidence adduced which I believed, which might lead one to believe that Mr. McKee\u2019s conduct had been anything but that of an upright and honest man. Mr. McKee in his testimony also indicated that his business affairs were closely integrated into the life of his own children and that of his brother and sisters. If Terry is handed over to the custody of his mother, there will be a breach of that association which in later years may redound very markedly in his favour in a financial way and in the way of the opening of proper business opportunities to him when he is through his education.\n* * *\nIn my view, the evidence did not establish immorality on Mrs. McKee\u2019s part but a looseness of public conduct and a lack of personal integrity and dignity which I think might provide a very unhappy background to the proper upbringing of the child. Evidence was also given of Mrs. McKee\u2019s behaviour in a small restaurant in Kitchener by one Rita Eckensviller. Mrs. McKee flatly denied this evidence, but I must say in this case, having seen the witness and heard her evidence, I accept it, and I do not believe Mrs. McKee\u2019s denial. Again the conduct complained of, which was public lovemaking of a reasonably innocuous character, was such which might be understood if not approved in adolescents. It did not tend I think to show immorality as much as a lack of appreciation of any proper standard of public conduct for one of her years, on her part. At the conclusion of her evidence I asked Mrs. McKee whether she wanted custody of her son Terry because she felt she could do better for him than his father or did she want to take him from his father because of her animosity toward him. She said in reply: \u201cI hope you believe me. I have no animosity toward him. I have really gotten over that. I did feel that way in the beginning, but it is not true any more, and she stated that she knew she could do well for the boy and really wanted him. One\u2019s belief in this statement is somewhat tempered by the fact that when Mrs. McKee returned to Kitchener to commence the proceedings which culminated in this issue, she visted the Ament home where Terry was being kept by his father, complete with a reporter and news photographer from the Detroit Daily News who took pictures of her Michigan attorney and herself vainly knocking at the door to see her infant child. One would think that this method of publicizing her difficulties would indicate a sense of drama which had perhaps taken possession of her to the exclusion of any real affection for her son, but of course it may be merely that customs and practices in these matters vary. In any event, conduct of this sort and the rather hysterical publicity which she apparently supplied to newspapers in Detroit, Kitchener and Toronto would tend to shake one\u2019s faith in her as a proper person to bring up a boy of seven whose serious education must now commence and who is entitled to a training inculcating proper standards of morals and decency.\n* * *\nIn her complaint filed in the Milwaukee action, among other things, Mrs. McKee made many allegations of what might be described a scandalous nature against her former husband, including allegations that McKee in the 1942 proceedings had caused his children and an employee named Charles Watt to give perjured evidence in his favour; that he had exercised improper influence through his attorneys on the trial judge; that he had secretly entered into collusion with her own attorneys for the purpose of defeating her rights and also had entered into an improper collusive agreement with the trial judge; that he secretly made payments to her attorneys for the purpose of securing the assistance and co-operation of the attorneys, conniving at her defeat; that he committed a fraud on the Superior Court of the State of California and subjected the trial judge to his domination and control and prevailed on him to make findings of fact which were not true.\n* * *\nVarious actions of Mrs. McKee were examined on her cross-examination by counsel for Mr. McKee and one of these was the basis on which she made the serious and scandalous claims in her Wisconsin action againt the court and her own attorneys in California. Whether there was a proper basis for these charges or not is of really very little interest to me, but on her cross-examination I gained a very strong impression that the facts on which she stated she based them would not justify their repetition as idle gossip, let alone as serious allegations of fact in litigation such as she commenced in the State of Wisconsin. Doubtless, the persons accused in this fashion are able to look after themselves, but it does in my view reflect very seriously on her judgment and capability that she should make such scandalous charges on so little evidence and such a small basis of fact. This, I think, merely reflects again on the opinion I must form of her as a proper person to have alone the care and custody of her infant child apart from the counterbalancing influence of the father, particularly at a time when his education and his proper upbringing become very important and may well shape his whole after life.\nThe learned trial judge sums up his findings as follows:\nLooking at the whole matter, his welfare seems inextricably bound up with the care, advice and education which his father can now give him, and I think his interests will be best served by leaving him where he is, in the custody of Mark T. McKee.\nHogg J.A., delivering the judgment of majority in the Court of Appeal, said:\nDuring the two years which, at the date of the judgment of Wells J., had elapsed since 1945, when the Superior Court of the State of California altered their former judgment and awarded the custody of the child Terry to his mother, the circumstances had changed. Upon a review of the evidence, I have formed the opinion, which coincides with that of the trial judge, the reasons for which he has set out in his well-considered and well-expressed judgment,\u2014that it is in the best interests of Terry, who is over seven years of age, having regard to his welfare, not only from the view point of his present life and education, but as well in the light of his future prospects, that he should be left in the custody of his father.\nThese concurrent findings with respect to the appellant, like the findings against her in the original judgment in California, are revealing and amply support the judgment in appeal. I think the courts below have correctly applied the relevant law, have given the proper weight to the California judgment, and the judgment in appeal ought not to be disturbed. I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Slaght, Ferguson, Boland and Slaght.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Sims, Broy, Schofield and Lochead.\n[1] [1948] O.R. 658.\n[2] [1947] O.R. 819.\n[3] [1940] 1 Ch. 54.\n[4] (1854) 4 DeG.

Some two months later she changed her mind and sought to regain custody of the child from the foster parents.\nHeld: That the consent required by the Adoption Act must exist at the moment the order of adoption is made. Re Hollyman [1945] 1 All E.R. 290, followed. At any time prior to the making of an order of adoption the wishes of the mother of an illegitimate child as to its custody must be given effect unless very serious and important reasons require that, having regard to the child\u2019s welfare, (the first and paramount consideration), they must be disregarded.

Mackinnon for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Estey and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing the decision of His Honour Judge Macdonell, Judge of the Surrogate Court of the County of York, and awarding the custody of an infant boy to the respondent.\nAt the opening of the appeal it was submitted by counsel for the appellants that the Surrogate Court was without jurisdiction. It is said that the jurisdiction of the Surrogate Court to deal with the custody of infants is purely statutory being derived from s. 1 of The Infants Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 215 and that, properly construed, this section confers jurisdiction only in the case of a legitimate child.\nWhile ordinarily this Court would hesitate to entertain a ground of appeal raised here for the first time and not taken before the trial Judge or before the Court of Appeal either on the hearing of the appeal or on the motion for leave to appeal to this Court, I think it necessary to consider this objection because if it should prove valid the result might well be that the order now in appeal is a nullity and the rights of the parties remain undecided. On consideration, I do not think that the objection is well taken. The relevant words of Section 1 of The Infants Act are:\u2014\n* * * The surrogate court of the county in which the infant resides, upon the application of * * * the mother of an infant, who may apply without a next friend, may make such order as the court sees fit regarding the custody of the infant * * *\nI cannot find anything in the rest of the Act to cut down the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cmother\u201d or of the word \u201cinfant\u201d. It is clear that the infant whose custody is in question was resident in the County of York at all material times and that the respondent who was the applicant in the Surrogate Court is his mother. In my view the Surrogate Court had jurisdiction to deal with the application.\nThe infant is the illegitimate child of the respondent. He was born at the city of Toronto on March 3, 1948. The home of the respondent is in England. She was visiting Ontario on a holiday in the year 1947, and there met the father of the infant. It appears that there is no intention of the respondent and the father of the infant being married. The respondent came to Toronto some months before the infant was born and secured employment there for a time. She is a comptometer operator and appears to have no difficulty in obtaining employment. The father of the infant gave some financial assistance while the respondent was unable to work. The respondent attended the Yarmey Clinic in Toronto for pre-natal care and was looked after by Doctor Stark who was then a member of the clinic. Mrs. Martin, one of the appellants, was a laboratory technician at the clinic, and she and the respondent became friendly. The respondent had not advised her parents in England of her condition and was in doubt as to whether she should try to keep her baby after it was born or whether she should make arrangements to have it adopted. Before the birth of the baby she had discussions as to this with Doctor Stark and others. The respondent\u2019s health was bad for some weeks after the birth, but she completely recovered and is now in good health.\nWhile the respondent was in hospital following the birth, Mrs. Martin visited her and they had some discussion as to whether the respondent would let Mrs. Martin adopt the boy, the appellants being then anxious to adopt him. On the 31st of March, 1948, the respondent signed a form of consent to the adoption of the infant. This consent is in the form of a statutory declaration headed \u201cIn the matter of the Adoption Act\u201d, and reads in part as follows:\n(1) That I am the unmarried mother of the said unnamed male infant who was born at the Grace Hospital, Toronto, in the County of York on the 3rd day of March, 1948.\n(2) That of my own free will and accord I hereby consent to an Order of Adoption with respect to the said child under the provisions of the said The Adoption Act.\n(3) That I fully understand the nature and effect of an Adoption Order in that all rights, duties, obligations and liabilities of the parent or parents of the adopted child in relation to the future custody, maintenance and education of the adopted child shall be extinguished, and that the effect of such Adoption Order will be permanently to deprive me of my parental rights in respect to the said child, and that, unless the Adoption Order otherwise provides, the child assumes the surname of the adopting parent.\nWe were informed by counsel that the original of this declaration is on a printed form which is supplied by the Department of Public Welfare which administers the Adoption Act; but no form of consent is prescribed by that Act or by the regulations made thereunder.\nThe infant was handed over to Mrs. Martin on April 1, 1948 and has since that date been in the custody of the appellants. It is conceded that they have looked after the infant in an admirable manner, that they are devoted to him, and are in a position to give him a good home and a suitable upbringing.\nNot very long after the infant had been given to the appellants, the respondent regretted her decision. On the 18th of June, 1948 she wrote a letter to Doctor Stark, who had advised her from time to time in a friendly way, asking him to use his best efforts to get her baby back for her. She also took the matter up with the officials of the Children\u2019s Aid Society. The respondent says that she approached Mrs. Martin in the matter as well as the Children\u2019s Aid Society, and while her evidence in this regard is not entirely free from ambiguity I read it as meaning that Mrs. Martin told her that the appellants would give the baby back if the respondent obtained a letter from her parents, with a witness, saying that they would provide a home for him. The date of this interview is not fixed but it appears to have been in the autumn of 1948. Mrs. Martin gave evidence, but she was not asked anything about this statement either in examination-in-chief or in cross-examination. In the view that I take, it is not of importance to determine whether the suggestion as to obtaining the letter from the respondent\u2019s parents was made by Mrs. Martin or by an official of the Children\u2019s Aid Society. The respondent did obtain a letter dated the 28th of December 1948, signed by her father and mother and by a witness, stating that her parents wished to adopt the baby.\nFollowing the receipt of this letter, it was ascertained that the appellants were not willing to give up the infant. The application to the Surrogate Court followed. The affidavit of the respondent in support of the application was sworn on the 13th of January, 1949, and the notice of motion is dated the 5th of February 1949. The matter was heard before His Honour Judge Macdonell on the 12th of April 1949.\nAccording to the respondent\u2019s evidence, which was accepted by the learned trial judge, the parents of the respondent are about fifty-five years of age. They are both in good health. The father is a retired sergeant of police, is in receipt of a pension and is gainfully employed as a civil servant. They live in a suburb of London in a comfortable home, which they own clear of encumbrance. They are willing and anxious to receive the respondent and infant and to adopt the infant.\nAt the conclusion of the hearing the learned trial judge dismissed the application, holding himself bound by a passage which he quoted from the judgment of McRuer C.J.H.C. in the case of Re Fex[2] at page 499, which was not in terms either rejected or adopted by the Court of Appeal in affirming such judgment. The passage referred to is as follows:\nWhere a parent has signed a solemn consent to adoption under the provisions of The Adoption Act and the foster parents have taken the child and assumed their parental duties with a view to fulfilling the probationary requirements of the Act, I do not think that a child is to be restored to the natural parent on the mere assertion of that parent\u2019s right. I think the parent must go further and show that \u201chaving regard to the welfare of the child\u201d it should not be permitted to remain with the foster parents.\nThe learned trial judge interpreted this as laying down the rule that under the circumstances outlined the Court must not deprive the foster parents of the custody of the child unless it be affirmatively shown that it would be detrimental to its welfare to remain with them. His Honour stated that, by reason of the decision in Re Fex, it was unnecessary for him to make the difficult choice as to which of the two proposed homes would be better for the infant.\nIn the Court of Appeal[3], Aylesworth J.A. with whom Bowlby J.A. agreed, did not agree with the interpretation placed by the learned trial Judge upon Re Fex. He says:\nI think it is clear from the judgment in that case, of not only the Chief Justice of the High Court before whom it came on to be heard in the first instance, but from the judgment of this Court on appeal, that the welfare of the child is the first and paramount consideration.\nLaidlaw J.A. dealt with the matter as follows:\nHowever, the facts that the mother of a child has voluntarily given the custody of it to others, and has consented of her own free will and accord to an order of adoption under the provisions of The Adoption Act with a full understanding of the nature and effect of an adoption order, do not in every such case prevent her from regaining custody of the child before an adoption order is made by the Court. The Court may, in the exercise of a discretionary power possessed by it, restore the custody of a child to its mother at any time before an adoption order has been made, notwithstanding the fact that she has given the custody of it to others in that manner and under those circumstances. On the other hand, the mother is not entitled in law to an order of the Court restoring the custody of her child to her in such a case upon proof only of the fact that she is the mother of the child. The paramount consideration and the question which the Court must decide in each particular case according to the circumstances is, \u201cWhat is best for the welfare of the child?\u201d\nThe Court of Appeal were unanimously of opinion that, although it is a case of great hardship so far as the appellants are concerned, under all the circumstances the welfare of the child will be best served by directing that he be returned to the respondent. I respectfully agree with this conclusion, and observe that the learned trial judge, who has had great experience in such matters, and who had the advantage, denied to the Appellate Courts, of hearing and observing all the parties, did not express any contrary view. It is now necessary to examine the argument of counsel for the appellant that even if the court should reach such a conclusion the appeal should nonetheless succeed. It is said that when consideration is given to the provisions of The Adoption Act (R.S.O. 1937, c. 218, amended 1949 Statutes of Ontario c. 1) the proper conclusion is that the respondent, by signing the consent of March 31, 1948 referred to above, forfeited any natural rights she might have had to the custody of her child, and contemporaneously with the surrender by her of her natural rights, by this free act of her own volition, new and important rights were acquired by the appellants who assumed their duties as foster parents of the child and were awaiting the expiry of the probationary period prescribed by The Adoption Act.\nIt is urged that the scheme of adoption established in Ontario contemplates a probationary period of two years during which time the conduct of those who apply for custody of a child, with a view to its adoption, and the conditions under which the child is living are under the scrutiny of the Provincial Officer (section 3e); that the consent of the respondent, as mother of her illegitimate child, which is required (by section 3b (1) and (2) and section 4 (a)) before an adoption order can be made, shall be executed before the commencement of the probationary period, and that after the expiration of the probationary period a final order of adoption may be made on the production and filing of such consent.\nIt is argued that the probationary period is not prescribed for the purpose of enabling a mother who has already executed a valid consent as required by section 3b(2) to regain custody of her child or to change her mind about its adoption but rather for the purpose of enabling the proper authorities to determine whether or not the adopting parents, and the conditions under which they live are satisfactory, having regard to the future welfare of the child.\nIt is said, if upheld, the decision in appeal will endanger the whole scheme of adoption, not only in Ontario but in other provinces in which legislation similar to that in Ontario is in force. Reliance is placed upon the decision in Re Fex (supra). It is argued that the learned trial judge correctly interpreted that decision and that it should be followed. Reference is made to a passage in the judgment of McRuer C.J.H.C. which follows immediately the passage quoted by the learned trial judge:\nOtherwise, the whole scheme of The Adoption Act may be undermined and persons of good will and affection who are willing to open their homes to unfortunate children may hesitate to do so if, after the adoption agreement has been signed and a child has been with them for nearly two years, the parent still has a paramount right in law to obtain its custody by a mere assertion of a parent\u2019s right.\nand to the statement of Middleton J. in Re Sinclair[4], decided before the enactment of The Adoption Act:\nFew would care to adopt a child if it may be taken from them without any fault on their part.\nIt is, I think, perfectly clear on the evidence, and on the findings of the learned trial judge and of the Court of Appeal that no fault is imputable to the appellants and that the home and upbringing which they are able and anxious to provide for the infant would be eminently satisfactory. If therefore the above argument is well-founded the appellants would be entitled to succeed.\nIn my opinion the argument must be rejected. It is, I think, well settled that the mother of an illegitimate child has a right to its custody, and that, apart from statute, she can lose such right only by abandoning the child or so misconducting herself that in the opinion of the Court her character is such as to make it improper that the child should remain with her. There is no suggestion in the case at bar that the respondent abandoned the child or that her conduct and character are other than excellent.\nIt is also clear that the mother of an illegitimate child cannot bind herself by an agreement to deliver up her child to a stranger, and that the Court will, on her application, compel the return of a child delivered pursuant to such an agreement. As stated by Lindley, L.J. in Regina v. Barnardo[5] at page 211:\nThe Court will not interfere with her (the mother) arbitrarily and will support her and give effect to her views and wishes unless it becomes the duty of the Court towards the child to refuse so to do. Taking this view of the mother\u2019s rights and of the duty of the Court, I see no reason why a mother should not from time to time change her mind as to where, how, or by whom her child shall be brought up, nor why the Court should interfere with her or refuse to support her, unless circumstances be proved which satisfy the Court that its duty to the infant requires it to act contrary to her wishes.\nThis judgment was affirmed sub. nom. Barnardo v. McHugh[6].\nAs was pointed out by Scrutton L.J. in In re J.M. Carroll[7], the circumstances which will move the Court to refuse to support the mother on the ground that her wishes are detrimental to the child must constitute \u201ca matter of essential importance\u201d or be \u201cvery serious and important\u201d.\nIt is urged that, in Ontario, these well settled rules are modified by the provisions of The Adoption Act, that the mother\u2019s consent to adoption once voluntarily given is, in effect, irrevocable, or at all events that her withdrawal of such consent can and should be disregarded by the Court unless it appears to be in the best interests of the child that she should be allowed to withdraw it. Reliance is placed upon the reasoning of the United States Court of Appeals in In re Adoption of a Minor[8]. The judgment in that case is, I think, distinguishable by reason of certain differences between the wording of the statute there under consideration and that of the Ontario Adoption Act. I prefer to follow the judgment of the Court of Appeal in England in re Hollyman[9]. The wording of the English Act dealt with in that case is I think similar in all relevant respects to that of the Ontario Adoption Act and I am of opinion, for the reasons stated by the Master of the Rolls, that the consent required by section 4 of the Ontario Act must exist at the moment the order of adoption is made. Of course, as is pointed out in that case, a consent once given remains operative unless revoked. The construction for which the appellants contend would bring about the result that the mother is bound by her consent from the moment of giving it, while the appellants remain free, up to the making of the order of adoption, to change their minds, leaving the obligation of the mother to maintain her child still in existence. The supposed danger of the purposes of The Adoption Act being defeated by the construction which I think is the proper one is met to a limited extent by the provisions of section 3d of The Adoption Act which permit the Court to dispense with the consent of the parents of a child if, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the Court is of opinion that such consent may properly be dispensed with. This will be a safeguard in a case, for example, where a consent voluntarily given at the commencement of the two year probationary period is sought to be capriciously withdrawn at its termination, and there are in the Court\u2019s opinion matters of essential importance having regard to the welfare of the infant which require that it be left with the foster parents. Should the view which I have expressed above as to the proper construction of The Adoption Act not be in accordance with the true intention of the Legislature such intention could, without difficulty, be expressed as an amendment to the Act. In the present state of the law as I understand it, giving full effect to the existing legislation, the mother of an illegitimate child, who has not abandoned it, who is of good character and is able and willing to support it in satisfactory surroundings, is not to be deprived of her child merely because on a nice balancing of material and social advantages the Court is of opinion that others, who wish to do so, could provide more advantageously for its upbringing and future. The wishes of the mother must, I think, be given effect unless \u201cvery serious and important\u201d reasons require that, having regard to the child\u2019s welfare, they must be disregarded.\nIn this case, the question which the Court has to decide is whether the child should remain with his foster parents or return to his mother, when it appears that there is every probability that he will be loved, well cared for and properly brought up in either situation. I agree with the Court of Appeal that the child should be returned to his mother.\nCounsel for the respondent stated that in the event of the appeal failing, the respondent would not ask for costs. It is a noteworthy feature of this case that in spite of the very strong desire of both parties to have the child, they have throughout treated each other with the utmost consideration and respect. There has been a complete absence of recrimination and each has conceded throughout that the child would be well cared for by the opposite party.\nBefore parting with the matter I would like to express appreciation of the assistance which we received from counsel, both of whom argued the case with great frankness and ability.\nThe appeal should be dismissed without costs.\nThe judgment of Rand and Kellock, JJ. was delivered by\nRAND J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Cartwright, but I desire to add the following observations to what he has said on the language of McRuer C.J.H.C. in re Fex[10], quoted by him. The Chief Justice treats as similar to his own, views expressed by Middleton J. in re Sinclair[11], and in Re Chiemelewski[12]. If his language is intended to mean, as the judge of first instance here thought it did, that after the mother of an illegitimate child, with a view to adoption, has transferred custody to another under a formal declaration of consent to adoption, she must, in order to recover the child, show in effect that the foster parents are unfit for further custody, in other words, treating the preliminary consent as irrevocable; then, with the greatest respect, I must dissent from it. In the settled formula, the welfare of the infant is the controlling consideration: that is, the welfare as the court declares it; but in determining welfare, we must keep in mind what Bowen L.J., in the case of In re Agar-Ellis[13], as quoted by Scrutton, L.J. in In re J.M. Carroll[14], says: \u201c* * * it must be the benefit to the infant having regard to the natural law which points out that the father knows far better as a rule what is good for his children than a Court of Justice can.\u201d Only omniscience could, certainly in balanced cases, pronounce with any great assurance for any particular custody as being a guarantee of ultimate \u201cbenefit\u201d however conceived. The successful administration of The Adoption Act requires, admittedly, an adequate appreciation of the interest of the person proposing to adopt, but in the light of the corresponding law in England, I doubt that the fears expressed are of real dangers, In Re Hollyman[15], in which it was held that the consent of the parent to adoption must be operative up to the moment of making the order, and that it might be withdrawn at any time before that, Lord Greene, M.R., uses this language:\nThe rules merely provide for the method of proving the consent which under the statute is necessary. If the rules had purported to dispense with the consent which the statute required, they would have been ultra vires. They merely provide for the method of proof, and all that the consent exhibited to the affidavit proves, is the fact that consent has been given. Of course, that consent remains operative unless revoked, but in my opinion no rule could have laid it down that the consent once given could not be retracted, for the simple reason that the Act requires, as I have said, that the consent shall be operative at the very moment when the order is made.\nSection 3 of that statute provides that the Court making the adoption order must be satisfied, that:\n(a) every person whose consent is necessary * * * has consented to and understands the nature and effect of the adoption order for which application is made * * *\nThat is the substance of the language of the statute of Ontario. The form of consent used in Re Fex and here is not statutory: it is departmental; and its effect is no more than evidence of the consent required by the statute when the order is made.\nThe situation in Re Sinclair and Re Chiemelewski was different: in them, the child had been given to foster parents by a Children\u2019s Aid Society. The distinguishing circumstance is that in such cases the State, for good reasons, has stepped in and asserted its paramount interest: and that the relations of foster parents so arising should not be \u201clightly disregarded\u201d or \u201clightly ignored\u201d without fault on their part, to use words of Middleton, J., is undoubted. In this case the State has not stepped in nor can I agree that we can properly assimilate the two situations. The question here is what, in the light of all circumstances, does the benefit of the child, in the broad sense indicated, call for.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Edmonds and Maloney.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hooper and Howell.\n[1] 1950 O.R. 35.\n[2] [1948] O.W.N. 497.\n[3] [1950] O.R. 35 at 42.\n[4] (1917) 12 O.W.N. 79.\n[5] [1891] 1 Q.B. 194.\n[6] [1891] A.C. 388.\n[7] [1931] 1 K.B. 317 at 336.\n[8] (1944) 144 Fed. 2d. 644.\n[9] [1945] 1 All E.R. 290.\n[10] [1948] O.W.N. 497 at 499.\n[11] (1917) 12 O.W.N. 79.\n[12] (1928) 61 O.L.R. 317.\n[13] (1883) 24 Ch.

Appellant was convicted of murder after a trial by jury. His defence was a denial that he had anything whatever to do with the matter. He testified that he was not at the time of the crime with the deceased and the three principal Crown witnesses as to all of whom it was open to the jury to take the view that they were accomplices. His conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nThe Crown called evidence in rebuttal of statements made by a defence witness in the absence of the accused contradictory of the evidence given by such witness at the trial. The trial judge not only failed to explain to the jury that such contradictory statements were no evidence of the truth of the facts stated therein and must be considered solely as a test of the credibility of such witness, but gave the jury to understand that this rebuttal evidence had evidentiary value and might be regarded by them as corroborative of the evidence of the alleged accomplices. Held: that, particularly as the trial judge had failed to instruct the jury that before evidence can be considered as corroborative within the meaning of the rule requiring corroboration of the evidence of an accomplice it must tend to show not merely that the crime has been committed but that the accused committed it, such non-direction and misdirection were fatal to the validity of the conviction.\nCrown counsel, in re-examination of a Crown witness, for the purpose of refreshing his memory, read to him from the transcript of his evidence at the preliminary hearing and elicited evidence that the accused had made a threat to such witness including a statement which would lead the jury to believe that on another occasion the accused had shot another person. Held: that, following the King v. Laurin, the deposition should not have been read to the jury. Quaere: Whether under the circumstances of the case it was permissible to refer to the deposition at all for the purpose of refreshing the memory of the witness. Held further: The trial judge should have, in this case, in the exercise of his discretion, excluded any evidence indicating that the accused had made such a statement, even though it might have been relevant to the issue of the guilt or innocence of the accused as being evidence of an attempt, on his part, to suppress evidence by means of a threat; it was wrong to admit such evidence which was highly prejudicial to the accused and in this case had substantially no probative value. (Noor Mohamed v. The King; Maxwell v. Director of Public Prosecutions and Rex v. Shellaker referred to.)\nHeld: The interference of the trial judge with the right of the defence to cross-examine one of the Crown witnesses (a right included in the right to make full answer and defence any improper interference with which will usually be a sufficient ground for quashing a conviction) did not produce any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice in the particular circumstances of this case.\nHeld: The trial judge should have followed the usual practice of indicating to the jury the nature of the evidence in support of the alibi and telling them that, even if they were not satisfied that the alibi had been proved, if the evidence in support of it raised in their minds a reasonable doubt of the accused's guilt it was their duty to acquit him. Held: The evidence as to the cause of the victim's death being largely circumstantial, the jury should have been directed that if and in so far as they based their verdict on circumstantial evidence, they must be satisfied not only that those circumstances were consistent with the accused having killed him but also that they were inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. (Hodge's case).\nHeld: Once this Court reaches the conclusion, on one or more of the points properly before it, that there has been error in law below, it is unfettered in deciding what order should be made by the views expressed in the Court of Appeal. Therefore, the argument, that the jurisdiction of this Court in criminal matters being limited to questions of law and the court appealed from having held that notwithstanding certain errors in law at the trial there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, such decision being on a question of fact or of mixed fact and law cannot be reviewed in this Court, is not entitled to prevail. (Brooks v. The King; Stein v. The King; Bouliane v. The King; Schmidt v. The King and Chapdelaine v. The King referred to).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec 1, affirming the conviction of the appellant, before a judge and jury, upon a charge of murder.\nAlexandre Chevalier K.C. for the appellant.\nNoel Dorion K.C. and Paul Miquelon K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a unanimous judgment of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) of the Province of Quebec 2, pronounced on the 5th day of May, 1950, affirming the conviction of the appellant upon a charge of having \"in the night of the 14th to the 15th of June, 1947, with other persons to be later identified killed and murdered G\u00e9rard Beaumont.\"\nThe appeal comes before us pursuant to an order of the Chief Justice of Canada pronounced on the 22nd day of May, 1950, granting the appellant leave to appeal to this court upon the following grounds.\n(1) the illegal admission of rebuttal evidence presented by the Crown for the alleged sole purpose of attacking the credibility of a defence witness by the name of Hamel which rebuttal evidence consisted in proof (2) of a previous contradictory statement made by the witness Hamel in the presence of the witnesses heard in rebuttal but in the absence of the Petitioner Lizotte and the failure of the trial Judge to explain to the jury that the said rebuttal evidence purported to be exclusively a test of the credibility of the said witness Hamel;\n(3) the illegal admission of a proof of character of the Petitioner by the illegal introduction in the evidence before the jury in the re-examination of one Maurice L\u00e9gar\u00e9 of the previous testimony of the said L\u00e9gar\u00e9 at the time of the preliminary inquiry which previous testimony included an alleged statement in the presence of L\u00e9gar\u00e9 that the Petitioner had previously shot somebody and would be able to shoot another person;\n(4) the illegal refusal by the trial Judge to permit the defence to establish in cross-examination of Mrs. Ren\u00e9 Boivin that the said Mrs. Boivin was greatly antagonistic and entertained a spirit of revenge against the Petitioner on account of previous testimonies by the Petitioner against the husband of the said Mrs. Ren\u00e9 Boivin in some previous cases before the Courts;\n(5) the error of the trial judge in his instructions to the jury in failing to direct the jury relatively to the proof of alibi and to the question of the benefit of the doubt in connection with this defence; the failure of the trial judge to instruct the jury that the Crown must prove not only the death of the victim but also that the death was caused by the accused considering that there was in the record no scientific or other proof of the cause of the death of G\u00e9rard Beaumont nor of the time of the said death;\n(6) the failure of the trial judge to instruct the jury concerning circumstantial evidence that such evidence must be not only compatible with the guilt of the accused but incompatible with his innocence.\nOn the afternoon of the 14th of June, 1947, G\u00e9rard Beaumont left his home at St-G\u00e9rard Majella intending to go by motor-bus to the City of Quebec. He was apparently in good health and sober and was said to have with him approximately forty dollars (although it is questionable whether this last mentioned fact was proved by any admissible evidence).\nOn the 22nd of June, 1947, the body of Beaumont was observed floating in the St. Charles River. A police officer brought the body to shore by the use of a rope with a brick attached. An inquest was held but there was no autopsy. The body was already in a state of decomposition. It was said by some of the witnesses that there were marks on the forehead of the victim. A verdict of death from drowning was returned.\nThe accused was arrested on the 26th of November, 1948. At the trial three witnesses Maurice L\u00e9gar\u00e9, Valli\u00e8res and Demers gave evidence which, while containing a number of contradictions and differences in matters of detail some of which were of importance and some comparatively trifling, was in substantial agreement as to the broad outlines of the case on which the Crown relied. Their account of what occurred may be briefly summarized as follows.\nAt about eleven o'clock on the night of June 14, L\u00e9gar\u00e9, Valli\u00e8res and Demers were together at or near a bus terminal in Quebec and were intending to return to the place where they were working at Rivi\u00e8re aux Pins in a taxicab driven by the accused. Before leaving they were in conversation with the deceased who said that he was going to return by motor-bus. The witness, Demers, says that Lizotte said to the deceased \"No, you are coming with us\" and that some of them pushed him into the car. Before leaving the city they stopped and L\u00e9gar\u00e9 purchased some bottles of beer. They continued on their way and drank some of the beer in the car. L\u00e9gar\u00e9 and the deceased, who had had some of the beer, began to quarrel in the back seat. L\u00e9gar\u00e9 said to the chauffeur \"arr\u00eate, on va r\u00e9gler cette affaire-l\u00e0 drette icitte.\" The chauffeur stopped the car. L\u00e9gar\u00e9 and Beaumont got out of the car. After getting out of the car, L\u00e9gar\u00e9 struck Beaumont twice on the head with a beer bottle and Valli\u00e8res struck him once. Beaumont fell to the ground. At this point Lizotte is said to have taken hold of Beaumont by the hair, to have struck him in the face with his fist and to have kicked him in the face. Thereafter they put Beaumont back into the rear of the car on the floor and drove off. They stopped for gasoline at the garage of Jean Paul Hamel at St. G\u00e9rard Majella as to which a little more must be said later. They then drove away towards Quebec on the Forty Arpents road. At a lonely spot on the road they stopped, took Beaumont out of the car, removed most of his clothes, took the money from his pockets and divided it amongst the accused, L\u00e9gar\u00e9 and Valli\u00e8res. They put Beaumont back in the car and then drove on and stopped at a point near le Remous des Hirondelles on the St. Charles River. At that point Lizotte is said by Valli\u00e8res and L\u00e9gar\u00e9 to have taken Beaumont out of the car and dragged him away in the direction of the river. According to Demers, Lizotte, Valli\u00e8res and L\u00e9gar\u00e9 went away together dragging Beaumont. Demers says that at this point Lizotte threatened him, seizing his neck-tie and saying:\u2014\"Ti-blond, tu vas m'aider ou tu vas mourir, la m\u00eame chose, toi aussi.\" Demers says that he refused to help saying he would as soon die. Demers says that when Lizotte, Valli\u00e8res and L\u00e9gar\u00e9 returned to the car he asked what they had done with Beaumont and Lizotte, Valli\u00e8res and L\u00e9gar\u00e9 said \"Il recommence \u00e0 revenir, il reprend sa connaissance, que le diable l'emporte, il s'en ira tout seul.\"\nIt is said that the accused then drove Demers, Valli\u00e8res and L\u00e9gar\u00e9 back to Rivi\u00e8re aux Pins arriving there about five o'clock in the morning of Sunday, June 15, 1947.\nIt should be emphasized that the above is but a brief outline of the main points of the narrative contained in the evidence of Demers, Valli\u00e8res and L\u00e9gar\u00e9 which occupied some hundreds of pages in the transcript and contains numerous points of disagreement.\nEvidence was given that the accused did not return the taxi to the garage of his employer, Madame Boivin, until the morning of Tuesday, June 17, that the seat-covers had then been removed and that he told Madame Boivin that he had removed them because they were dirty. The theory of the Crown appears to be that Beaumont died either as a result of the blows or kicks given to him by the accused or as a result of being thrown into the river by the accused, while still alive.\nThe defence is a denial that the accused had anything whatever to do with the matter. The accused gave evidence. He denied that he was with the deceased, L\u00e9gar\u00e9, Valli\u00e8res or Deniers on the night in question. Evidence was given by his wife and sister-in-law that during the month of June, 1947, which his wife claims to remember particularly well as she was expecting shortly to give birth to a child, the accused never came into the house at night later than midnight except on one occasion when he came in about 1.30 a.m.\nThe first ground of appeal arises out of the following circumstances. The Crown witnesses, Demers, Valli\u00e8res and L\u00e9gar\u00e9 stated, as mentioned above, that after Beaumont had been assaulted and put back in the car, the accused remarked that he was running short of gasoline and drove to the gas station of Jean Paul Hamel at St-G\u00e9rard Majella, arriving there about 2 o'clock in the morning, that they had to wait for some little time but that Hamel finally came down and supplied them with some gasoline and that they then drove away.\nHamel, called as a witness for the defence, testified that he had not served Lizotte or any of the other witnesses with gasoline on the night in question and he went on to state that he could not have done so as he did not have any gasoline during the month of June. The defence called one Georges Marchand an employee of the Imperial Oil Company who said that that company had supplied Hamel with gasoline in the years 1946 and 1947 but had not supplied him with any between the month of November, 1946 and the 28th of June, 1947. In rebuttal the Crown called one Joseph L\u00e9gar\u00e9 who testified that he had supplied Hamel with a total of ten barrels of gasoline containing 45 gallons each during the months of May, June and July, 1947. During Hamel's cross-examination he was asked whether he had had conversations with three persons, Eugene Rivard, Lucien Falardeau and Germaine Beaumont (Dame Lucien Falardeau). Hamel was asked whether Rivard had come to his store during the night of the 15th to the 16th of June, 1947, apparently to get gasoline. Hamel said that Rivard had come but he thought that it was on the previous night, and that he had not come out nor had he served Rivard with gasoline. He was asked whether he had had a conversation with Rivard a few days later and had said to him, referring to his visit just mentioned: \"Pourquoi ne vous \u00eates-vous pas nomm\u00e9 des fois qu'il vient des jeunes qui sont chauds, qui font du train\", ou encore \"g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement des jeunes qui viennent la nuit, qui font du train la nuit, j'aime pas \u00e7a et si vous vous \u00e9tiez nomm\u00e9 je vous aurais servi?\" Hamel admitted having had a conversation with Rivard but denied having used the words mentioned. Rivard was called in rebuttal and deposed to the words which Hamel had used. These words were identical in meaning with those which had been put to Hamel. Hamel was asked in cross-examination whether on or about the 22nd of June, 1947, he had had a conversation with Lucien Falardeau, a brother-in-law of Beaumont. The question was then put to him: \"Quelques jours apr\u00e8s la disparition de celui qui serait son beau-fr\u00e8re aujourd'hui et que vous lui aviez dit ceci: 'Que vous trouviez \u00e7a effrayant la disparition de G\u00e9rard et que dans la nuit du samedi, samedi en question, 14 au 15 juin, vous lui aviez dit qu'il \u00e9tait venu en taxi, vous aviez cru entendre sa voix, la voix de G\u00e9rard?'\" Hamel denied having made any such statement. In rebuttal Lucien Falardeau deposed that Hamel had said to him speaking of the deceased: \"Bien, il m'a dit qu'il \u00e9tait all\u00e9 un char, le samedi qu'il \u00e9tait disparu, pour avoir du gaz. Il m'a dit 'J'ai cru que G\u00e9rard \u00e9tait dans le char'.\" Hamel was asked in cross-examination in regard to Madame Falardeau: \"Vous rappelez-vous d'avoir rencontr\u00e9 madame Falardeau, soeur de G\u00e9rard Beaumont, quelques jours apr\u00e8s la disparition de son fr\u00e8re ou apr\u00e8s qu'on eut rep\u00each\u00e9 le cadavre de son fr\u00e8re et lui avoir dit \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s ceci, et je cite: 'Je sais qu'il est venu un taxi pour avoir du gaz, ils ont cogn\u00e9 pas mal longtemps, j'ai vu que c'\u00e9tait des gars pour avoir du gaz, j'ai descendu et je leur en ai donn\u00e9. J'ai jet\u00e9 un coup d'oeil dans la machine puis j'ai cru que c'\u00e9tait G\u00e9rard qui \u00e9tait \u00e9tendu dans le fond de la machine, \u00e0 terre, puis il y avait du sang dans la machine, oui ou non avez-vous dit \u00e7a \u00e0 madame Falardeau?\" Hamel denied having made such a statement. Madame Falardeau was called in rebuttal but just after the question had been put to her as to what statement, if any, Hamel had made to her, she was apparently taken ill in the witness box and the matter was not further pursued.\nWhat is here complained of is not the admission of the evidence of Rivard and Lucien Falardeau as to the statements contradictory of his evidence in chief which Hamel is alleged to have made to them or of the evidence of the witness Jos. L\u00e9gar\u00e9 as to his having supplied gasoline to Hamel but the complete failure of the learned trial judge to explain to the jury that the contradictory statements were no evidence of the truth of the facts stated therein but must be considered solely as a test of the credibility of the witness Hamel. It is said that, far from giving the jury any such direction, the learned judge gave them to understand that this rebuttal evidence had evidentiary value and could be regarded by the jury as corroboration of the evidence of L\u00e9gar\u00e9 and Valli\u00e8res, whose evidence was clearly that of accomplices, and of the evidence of Demers as to which the learned trial judge, in my opinion properly, told the jury that they might or might not regard it as being that of an accomplice.\nAt the conclusion of the argument, in the absence of the jury, upon the trial judge ruling that the rebuttal evidence tendered was admissible, counsel for the accused said: \"Alors, je croirais qu'il faudrait que vous expliquiez aux jur\u00e9s qu'il s'agit de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 d'Hamel,\" and the learned trial judge replied \"Absolument.\" and after a short further discussion counsel for the accused said, \"Je fais application pour que, dans votre charge, vous l'expliquiez bien.\"\nIn charging the jury the learned trial judge dealt fully with the danger of convicting an accused upon the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice or accomplices. His charge in this regard is not a subject of complaint before us but the directions given in regard to the rebuttal evidence must be considered in the light of what had been said on the matter of corroboration and it is important to note that there was a complete failure to instruct the jury that before evidence can be considered as corroborative within the rule it must be evidence which tends to implicate the accused, or, as it is often put, it must be evidence which tends to show not merely that the crime charged has been committed but that the accused committed it.\nThe effect of this rebuttal evidence was dealt with by the learned trial judge in the following passages in his charge to the jury:\nIl y a aussi le fait du voyage du retour et de ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, vous vous demanderez s'il n'y a pas certains faits que ces trois t\u00e9moina rapportent qui ne sont pas corrobor\u00e9s par des t\u00e9moins \u00e9trangers. Vous vous demanderez ensuite ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 chez Hamel dans la nuit, et l\u00e0, vous aurez \u00e0 examiner si ce t\u00e9moin dit la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, et si vous en venez \u00e0 la conclusion que r\u00e9ellement il y a eu arr\u00eat chez Hamel, vous aurez l\u00e0 une corroboration d'une partie importante des t\u00e9moignages de L\u00e9gar\u00e9, Valli\u00e8res et Demers.\n* * *\nC'est un incident assez important, c'est un fait mat\u00e9riel, que s'il \u00e9tait prouv\u00e9, et c'est \u00e0 vous \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s'il est prouv\u00e9, servirait \u00e0 corroborer pour partie la version des trois t\u00e9moins de la Couronne.\n* * *\nSi vous en venez \u00e0 la conclusion que Hamel n'a pas dit vrai, vous avez l\u00e0 une corroboration du t\u00e9moignage des trois t\u00e9moins de la Couronne, pour ce fait qui se serait pass\u00e9 entre le pr\u00e9tendu assaut et entre le temps ou \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec o\u00f9 le corps aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 jet\u00e9 \u00e0 l'eau. Car lorsqu'on aurait pris de la gazoline chez Hamel, la victime dans ce temps-l\u00e0 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 assaillie et aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 dans le fond de la voiture.\nIn my view there was both non-direction and misdirection as to the purpose and effect of the rebuttal evidence.\nIn dealing with the second ground of appeal mentioned above, it is first necessary to state briefly what occurred at the trial. Towards the end of the examination in chief, by counsel for the Crown, the witness, Maurice L\u00e9gar\u00e9 was asked the following questions and made the following answers.\nQ. Maintenant, monsieur L\u00e9gar\u00e9, apr\u00e8s que \u00e7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, avez-vous recontr\u00e9 Roger Lizotte dans la suite?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Combien de temps apr\u00e8s et o\u00f9 l'ayez-vous rencontr\u00e9?\nR. Quinze jours, trois semaines apr\u00e8s.\nQ. A quel endroit?\nR. Chez Omer Daigle.\nQ. A-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 question de cette affaire-l\u00e0?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Qu'est-ce qui s'est dit \u00e0 ce propos-l\u00e0?\nR. Je m'en rappelle pas. Q. Vous en a-t-il parl\u00e9, lui?\nR. Je sais qu'il m'a dit de fermer ma gueule.\nQ. A-t-il ajout\u00e9 d'autre chose?\nR. Il dit: si tu fermes pas ta gueule, il y a de quoi qui est dangereux.\nQ. Y a-t-il eu d'autre chose de dit?\nR. Je m'en rappelle pas.\nThe examination in chief concluded shortly after this and was followed by a lengthy cross-examination in which the witness was asked nothing whatever in regard to this particular incident. At the conclusion of the cross-examination counsel for the Crown re-examined the witness on certain matters which had arisen in the course of the cross-examination, and when he had reached the end of this reexamination asked the court's permission to examine on a matter which did not arise out of the cross-examination. Counsel indicated that he wished to refer the witness to certain statements made by him at the preliminary enquiry for the purpose of refreshing his memory. Counsel for the defence objected on the ground that the evidence proposed to be given would be inadmissible as constituting evidence of the bad character of the accused. After some argument, the learned trial judge decided to permit the re-examination. His grounds for so doing are stated in the following words:\nIl n'est pas question d'un fait; il est question d'un aveu, d'une d\u00e9claration de l'accus\u00e9. C'est diff\u00e9rent entre prouver un fait et une d\u00e9claration. Il y a une grosse diff\u00e9rence. Je vais permettre la question, mais seulement M. Dorion, compl\u00e9tez, s'il y a lieu, la d\u00e9claration d'aveu que vous entendez \u00e9tablir, jusqu'\u00e0 preuve du contraire.\nThe jury was brought back into the court room and the transcript continues as follows:\nQ. Monsieur L\u00e9gar\u00e9, pour revenir \u00e0 ces propos qu'aurait tenus Lizotte chez Daigle, auxquels vous avez r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 hier dans votre examen en chef, vous rappelez-vous qu'il en a \u00e9t\u00e9 question \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire devant l'Honorable Juge Pettigrew, alors que je vous interrogeais?\nR.

Qu'est-ce que Lizotte a dit? racontez \u00e7\u00e0 \u00e0 la Cour? R. Il a dit: \"Si tu fermes pas ta gueule, je vais faire comme j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait \u00e0 un autre.\" avez-vous dit cela \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ.

Vous vous en rappelez maintenant?\nOui, monsieur.\nMe NOEL DORION, c.r.\nQ. Qu'est-ce qu'il a dit qu'il ferait? Je vous posais la question\u2014et vous avez r\u00e9pondu: d'apr\u00e8s l'enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire: \"il a dit: 'J'en ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 tir\u00e9 un, je suis capable d'en tirer un autre'; vous rappelez-vous avoir dit cela \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Ce que vous avez dit \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire \u00e9tait-il exact l\u00e0-dessus?\nR. Oui, monsieur.\nQ. Alors, est-ce vrai qu'il vous a dit cel\u00e0 \u00e0 cette occasion-l\u00e0?\nR. Oui.\nIt appears to me that the evidence quoted above offends the well settled rule stated in the following words in the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Noor Mohamed v. The King 3.\nIn Makin v. Attorney General for New South Wales (1894) A.C. 57, 65, Lord Herschell L.C. delivering the judgment of the Board, laid down two principles which must be observed in a case of this character. Of these the first was that \"it is undoubtedly not competent for the prosecution to adduce evidence tending to show that the accused has been guilty of criminal acts other than those covered by the indictment, for the purpose of leading to the conclusion that the accused is a person likely from his criminal conduct or character to have committed the offence for which he is being tried.\" In 1934 this principle was said by Lord Sankey L.C., with the concurrence of all the noble and learned Lords who sat with him, to be \"one of the most deeply rooted and jealously guarded principles of our criminal law\" and to be \"fundamental in the law of evidence as conceived in this country.\" (Maxwell v. The Director of Public Prosecutions 4 ).\nThe rule just stated, is subject to the qualification also stated in Makin's case that the mere fact that the evidence adduced tends to show the commission of other crimes does not render it inadmissible if it be relevant to an issue before the jury. It is urged that the evidence in question was legally admissible and was relevant to the issue of the guilt or innocence of the accused as being evidence of an attempt, on his part, to suppress evidence by means of a threat. The Crown relies upon such statements as the following: \"The presence or absence of facts showing (the accused's) consciousness of having done the act may also be proved\u2014e.g.,\u2014the fabrication or suppression of evidence.\" Phipson on Evidence, 8th Edition at page 127. There is a similar statement in Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd Edition, vol. 2, section 278. The principle on which such evidence is admitted is stated by Phillimore J. in Rex v. Watt 5 It may be taken, I think, to be the general rule that evidence may be given against a party in either a civil or criminal case to show that he attempted to suppress evidence. It is true that in the English cases cited in support of the rule proceedings were actually pending at the time of the alleged suppression but there seems to be no reason, in principle, for refusing to apply the rule to cases of attempts to suppress evidence before any proceedings have been commenced. It is argued by the Crown that had the witness L\u00e9gar\u00e9 given the evidence objected to when he was first asked about his conversation with the accused it would have been admissible under the principle just stated. It might be sufficient for the disposition of this argument to point out that this did not happen and that we are not concerned to discuss a situation which did not, in fact, arise; but, since, in my view, there should be a new trial, I think it desirable to state that, in my opinion, this is eminently a case in which the learned judge presiding at the trial should, in the exercise of his discretion, exclude any evidence indicating that Lizotte had made a statement which would lead the jury to believe that on another occasion he had shot another person. The rule which I think should guide the trial judge in regard to this matter is referred to in the judgment of Isaacs C.J. giving the unanimous judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, the other members of which were Channell, Bray, Avory and Lush, JJ., in Rex v. Shellaker.6 At page 418, the learned Chief Justice refers to the class of cases \"in which, though in strictness the evidence is admissible, the judge may be of opinion that it is of so little real value and yet indirectly so prejudicial to the prisoner, or that it is so remote, that it ought not to be given.\" In Noor Mohamed v. The King (supra) the matter is put as follows at page 192.\nIt is right to add, however, that in all such cases the judge ought to consider whether the evidence which it is proposed to adduce is sufficiently substantial, having regard to the purpose to which it is professedly directed, to make it desirable in the interest of justice that it should be admitted. If, so far as that purpose is concerned, it can in the circumstances of the case have only trifling weight, the judge will be right to exclude it. To say this is not to confuse weight with admissibility. The distinction is plain, but cases must occur in which it would be unjust to admit evidence of a character gravely prejudicial to the accused even though there may be some tenuous ground for holding it technically admissible. The decision must then be left to the discretion and the sense of fairness of the judge.\nI refer also to the same case at page 195.\n\u2026 Their Lordships think that a passage from the judgment of Kennedy J. in the well known case of Rex v. Bond, (1906) 2 K.B. 389, 398, may well be quoted in this connection: \"If, as is plain, we have to recognize the existence of certain circumstances in which justice cannot be attained at the trial without a disclosure of prior offences, the utmost vigilance at least should be maintained in restricting the number of such cases, and in seeing that the general rule of the criminal law of England, which (to the credit, in my opinion, of English justice) excludes evidence of prior offences, is not broken or frittered away by the creation of novel and anomalous exceptions.\" Their Lordships respectfully approve this statement, which seems to them to be completely in accord with the later statement of the Lord Chancellor in Maxwell's case (1935) A.C. 309, 320, when he said \"It is of the utmost importance for a fair trial that the evidence should be prima facie limited to matters relating to the transaction which forms the subject of the indictment and that any departure from these matters should be strictly confined.\" They would regret the adoption of any doctrine which made the general rule subordinate to its exceptions.\nMy reason for thinking that this evidence should have been excluded, no matter when tendered, is that the statement, while calculated to create a prejudice against the accused the extent of which could scarcely be overestimated, has in the particular circumstances of this case substantially no probative value. Evidence of a threat made by the accused for the purpose of suppressing evidence, given by some independent witness, might, in a greater or less degree, go to strengthen the jury's belief in L\u00e9gar\u00e9's story or to lessen their belief in that of the accused, but when the alleged incident comes only out of the mouth of L\u00e9gar\u00e9 who had already deposed to all the facts on which the Crown relied as establishing the guilt of the appellant, its probative value seems to me to be very slight.\nNo permission to cross-examine L\u00e9gar\u00e9 was obtained nor was he declared an adverse witness so that his statement made at the preliminary hearing might be proved pursuant to the provisions of section 9 of the Canada Evidence Act; and there is nothing in the record to suggest that either of these courses could properly have been followed. The sole ground on which counsel for the Crown sought permission to show the deposition to the witness was for the purpose of refreshing his memory and it is on that ground that it was argued before us that the course followed was not unlawful.\nAt the trial while counsel for the defence objected throughout to the re-examination of L\u00e9gar\u00e9 on this subject-matter he did not expressly raise the objection that under the circumstances of this particular case L\u00e9gar\u00e9 ought not to be allowed to refer to the transcript of his evidence at the preliminary hearing for the purpose of refreshing his memory on the grounds that such evidence had been given more than seventeen months after the alleged conversation and that L\u00e9gar\u00e9 had repeatedly stated in the course of his cross-examination that statements made by him at the preliminary hearing were inaccurate. I do not think that the question whether such objection if made should have been maintained is before us on this appeal. Had it been otherwise it might have been necessary to consider whether the view expressed in Phipson on Evidence, 8th Edition at page 461 and in Halsbury's Laws of England, 2nd Edition, Volume 13, pages 753 et seq., section 829, or that in Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd Edition at pages 100 et seq., sections 758 to 765, is to be preferred and whether if the former view is accepted the principles which guide the court in determining whether a witness may look at a writing to refresh his memory differ in the case of a deposition from those applicable in the case of other writings. Assuming, but not deciding, that the circumstances of this case were such that the witness might have been permitted to refer to his deposition for the purpose of refreshing his memory, I agree with Barclay J. that the whole incident was illegal. I think it was rightly held in The King v. Laurin7, that the deposition must not be read to the jury as was done in the case at bar. I think that the evidence in question was wrongly admitted and that it cannot be said that it did not cause the gravest prejudice to the accused.\nAs to the third ground of appeal, the court indicated to Counsel for the Crown that it did not require him to address any argument in regard to this ground. It was, I think, made clear at the time that the reason for so doing was that in the particular circumstances of this case it was the opinion of the court that the interference by the learned trial judge with the cross-examination could not be said to have produced any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. The purpose of the cross-examination of Madame Boivin which was stopped was to elicit an admission that she entertained ill feelings towards the accused because of evidence which he had given against her husband in criminal proceedings in which her husband had been convicted. The facts which the defence sought to establish were brought out in the cross-examination of the witness Boivin in the witness box. I am in agreement with Bertrand J.8 where he says in his judgment:\nC'\u00e9tait le droit de la d\u00e9fense de pouvoir transquestionner le t\u00e9moin sur ces raisons, et le juge aurait d\u00fb permettre ces questions.\nThe ruling of the court on this point was not intended to cast any doubt on the well established rule that the right to make full answer and defence includes the right to cross-examine the Crown witnesses with freedom and that any improper interference by the trial judge with this right will usually be a sufficient ground for quashing a conviction.\nAs to the fourth ground of appeal, the learned trial judge made only passing reference to the evidence given in support of the defence of an alibi. I do not find it necessary to consider whether, in view of the repeated and eminently proper direction given by the learned trial judge to the jury that they must consider all the evidence whether given by the Crown or the defence and if having done so they entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused they should acquit him, it could be said that there was error in the charge in this regard; but I do respectfully venture to suggest that in this case it would have been well to follow the usual practice of indicating to the jury the nature of the evidence put forward in\nsupport of the alibi and telling them that, even if they are not satisfied that the alibi has been proved, if the evidence in support of it raises in their minds a reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt it is their duty to acquit him.\nIt is obvious that where an accused is not charged until some seventeen months after the alleged commission of an offence, although he be in fact innocent, it will only be in the rarest of cases that he is able to establish an alibi beyond peradventure. While the evidence of the witness Savard tendered in support of the alibi appeared to relate not to the week-end of the 15th of June, 1947, but rather to the following week-end, the evidence of the accused's wife, if believed, showed that he could not have committed the crime and it was supported by the evidence of the accused's sister-in-law.\nThe fifth and sixth grounds of appeal may well be considered together. It is argued on behalf of the appellant that the learned trial judge failed to instruct the jury that before they could convict the accused of the murder of Beaumont they must find on the evidence that it was proved beyond a reasonable doubt not only that the victim was killed but that he was killed by the accused. In my respectful opinion the learned trial judge failed to charge the jury adequately on this point.\nOn the theory of the Crown as set out in the factum of counsel for the respondent, the death of Beaumont was caused by Lizotte by striking and kicking the victim in the face or by throwing him into the river when he was still alive. If there was evidence on which the jury could properly find beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim's death must have been caused by one or other of these means, it would not be necessary that such evidence should be of what is commonly referred to as a scientific nature but it was essential to the verdict that there should be such evidence. In a case, such as this, where the defence is that the accused had nothing to do with the matter whatever, it is obvious that the defense will be unable to furnish any explanation as to how the victim met his death and the onus rests upon the Crown to bring home to the accused, beyond a reasonable doubt, the killing of the victim by him. This being so, and the evidence upon which the jury might have come to the conclusion that the accused killed Beaumont being largely circumstantial, it was, in my opinion essential that they should be directed that if and in so far as they based their verdict on circumstantial evidence, they must, in the words of Alderson B. in Hodge's case 9, be satisfied not only that those circumstances were consistent with his having committed the act but also that such circumstances were inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that it was the prisoner who in fact killed Beaumont.\nIn the factum of the respondent it is submitted that it matters not whether Beaumont was actually killed by the accused, by L\u00e9gar\u00e9 or by Valli\u00e8res or by the combined actions of the three of them. This submission is based on the ground that each was responsible for the acts of the others by reason of the provisions of section 69, subsection 2 of the Criminal Code. The addresses of counsel to the jury do not appear in the record before us but I find nothing in the charge of the learned trial judge to the jury to indicate that the theory of the Crown depended upon invoking the terms of section 69(2). In my opinion the evidence falls short of disclosing the formation by the accused, Valli\u00e8res and L\u00e9gar\u00e9 of a common intention to prosecute any unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein, which preceded the alleged striking of the victim with a beer bottle by L\u00e9gar\u00e9 and Valli\u00e8res. Certainly there was no adequate instruction to the jury as to the necessity of their being satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused, L\u00e9gar\u00e9 and Valli\u00e8res had formed a common intention to prosecute an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein and that the killing of Beaumont was or ought to have been known to be a probable consequence of the prosecution of such common purpose before they could properly convict Lizotte, if, in their view, the evidence was consistent with the view that the victim was killed by L\u00e9gar\u00e9 and Valli\u00e8res.\nOur jurisdiction is limited to dealing with the points of law upon which leave to appeal has been granted and these points do not include a submission that there was no evidence upon which a jury could have found that Lizotte, in fact, killed Beaumont, and I, therefore, do not consider whether such an argument could have been supported. I am, however, of opinion that a verdict of guilty cannot be supported in the absence of a clear direction to the jury that they could not find the accused guilty unless they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that it was he who actually killed Beaumont. If, for example, the jury were of the opinion that, consistently with the evidence, the death of Beaumont may have been caused by the blows on the head with bottles said to have been struck by L\u00e9gar\u00e9 and Valli\u00e8res and were not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that his death was caused by blows struck by the accused or that the accused took part in throwing him into the river while still alive they could not find him guilty of murder; I cannot find that they were properly instructed in this regard.\nThe importance of what I respectfully consider to be non-direction in regard to the effect to be given by the jury to circumstantial evidence arises chiefly in regard to the matter of the actual cause of death. Hodge's case was a case where all the evidence against the accused was circumstantial. It is argued that the direction there prescribed is not necessary in a case where there is direct evidence against the accused as well as circumstantial evidence. However that may be, it is my opinion that where the proof of any essential ingredient of the offence charged depends upon circumstantial evidence it is necessary that the direction be given.\nOne further argument requires consideration. At the conclusion of his able argument Mr. Dorion submitted that the jurisdiction of this court in criminal matters being limited to questions of law and the court appealed from having held that notwithstanding certain errors in law at the trial there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice and that the appeal should be dismissed under the provisions, of section 1014(2) of the Criminal Code, such decision cannot be reviewed in this court. It is argued that in reaching the decision to apply section 1014(2) the Court of Appeal must of necessity have examined and weighed the evidence and that consequently such decision is one of fact or of mixed fact and law and, therefore, not subject to review in this court. It is urged that the appeal must be dismissed even if this court should be of opinion that any or all of the points of law argued before us are well taken.\nI do not think that this argument is entitled to prevail. In the case at bar it might perhaps be disposed of by pointing out that in my opinion there were serious errors in matters of law at the trial which the Court of Appeal did not regard as being errors at all; but even had the Court of Appeal found the existence of all the errors in law which in my view did occur and nonetheless dismissed the appeal pursuant to section 1014(2), I do not think that this court would be without jurisdiction.\nCounsel were not able to refer us to any reported case in which the argument put forward by Mr. Dorion appears to have been considered. Its importance is obvious. If given effect it would have the result that in any case in which a Court of Appeal dismisses an appeal because in its view, in spite of error in law at the trial, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred this court could not entertain, or at all events could not allow, an appeal from such judgment no matter how grave, in the view of this court, was the error complained of.\nThe solution of this question depends, in the first instance, on the wording of the relevant sections of the Criminal Code. It will be observed that the jurisdiction of this court is conferred by a form of wording different from that which confers jurisdiction on the Court of Appeal. As has already been mentioned, the jurisdiction of this court is confined to considering questions of law while the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to deal not only with questions of law but with questions of mixed law and fact and with questions of fact alone. Under section 1014(1) the Court of Appeal shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion:\n(a) that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence; or\n(b) that the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision of any question of law; or\n(c) that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;\nand in any other case shall dismiss the appeal. Then follows subsection 2, reading as follows:\nThe court may also dismiss the appeal if, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that on any of the grounds above mentioned the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is also of opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.\nThe jurisdiction of this court is limited to hearing and determining appeals on:\n(i) any question of law on which there has been dissent in the Court of Appeal.\n(1023), or\n(ii) any question of law, if leave to appeal, is granted by a judge of this court.\n(1025).\nIn my view it is the duty of this court, in the first instance, to examine the point or points of law properly brought before it either under (i) or (ii) above or, as may sometimes happen, under both (i) and (ii). If the court comes to the conclusion that there has been no error in law it follows that the appeal will be dismissed. If, on the other hand, this court is of opinion that there has been error in law in regard to any one or more of the points properly before it, then I think, there devolves upon it the duty, in disposing of the appeal, to \"make such rule or order thereon, either in affirmance of the conviction or for granting a new trial, or otherwise, or for granting or refusing such application, as the justice of the case requires.\" (section 1024).\nIn my opinion once this court reaches the conclusion, on one or more of the points properly before it, that there has been error in law below it is unfettered in deciding what order should be made by the views expressed in the Court of Appeal. This would be my view if the point were devoid of authority. It is I think supported by the practice followed for many years. While numerous cases might be cited it seems to me to be sufficient to refer to: Brooks v. The King 10 and Stein v. The King 11. In Brooks v. The King this court allowed the appeal and directed a new trial on the ground that the learned trial judge had misdirected the jury as to the consideration which they should give to certain evidence given by the defence. In the Court of Appeal for Ontario 12, Masten J.A. dissented, taking the view that because of this particular misdirection the conviction should be quashed. The judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal 13 was delivered by Grant J.A. After discussing the misdirection complained of that learned judge continued:\nWe are of opinion that upon this ground no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice can have occurred.\nThis court 14, after holding that there was misdirection, continued:\n\u2026 That it may seem probable to an appellate court perusing the record that the jury would have reached that conclusion, does not warrant affirming the conviction. That would, in effect, be to substitute the verdict of the court for that of a jury properly instructed, to which the appellant was entitled. Misdirection in a material matter having been shewn, the onus was upon the Crown to satisfy the Court that the jury, charged as it should have been, could not, as reasonable men, have done otherwise than find the appellant guilty. Gouin v. The King (1926) S.C.R. 539, at p. 543; Allen v. The King (1911) 44 Can. SCR. 331, at p. 339; Makin v. Att.-Gen. for New South Wales (1894) A.C. 57, at p. 70. That burden the Crown, in the view of the majority of the Court, has not discharged. There was non-direction by the learned trial judge in a vital matter, tantamount in the circumstances of this case to misdirection, and constituting a miscarriage of justice within subs. 1(c) of s. 1014 of the Criminal Code. Upon the whole case, and taking into consideration the entire charge, the majority of the Court, with respect, finds itself unable to accept the view expressed by the learned judge who delivered the majority judgment in the Appellate Division that \"no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice can have occurred\" at the trial. (Criminal Code, s. 1014(2)).\"\nStein v. The King, supra, was an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba (4). The court consisted of Perdue, C.J.M., Fullerton, Dennistoun, Prendergast and Trueman J.J.A. Fullerton J.A. dissented on the ground that statements made by persons other than the accused were wrongly admitted in evidence. Prendergast J.A. held that this evidence had been wrongly admit- ted but that the appeal should be dismissed as there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. (See the report at page 379). Trueman J.A. held that at least one of the statements admitted should have been refused and continued,\u2014\"independently altogether of the statements made by Paulin and Webster in the presence of Stein, the Crown's case was conclusively made out. The jury must inevitably have arrived at the same verdict had the impeached evidence not been admitted.\" (See report at page 388). The Chief Justice and Dennistoun J.A. simply agreed that the appeal should be dismissed. It seems clear that the ratio decidendi of the majority of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was that although an error in law had been made no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred. This court also held that the error in law complained of had occurred but, differing from the Court of Appeal, held that it could not be said that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had actually occurred, and allowed the appeal.\nThe view that this court exercises its own judgment as to whether or not it can be said that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred, I think, appears not only from the two cases last cited but also from Boulianne v. The King 15 and Schmidt v. The King 16, in both of which this court gave effect to the argument that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred, and dismissed the appeals, and from Chapdelaine v. The King 17 in which this court allowed the appeal, refusing to give effect to the argument that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred.\nI have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that this is not a case in which it can be said that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred by reason of the errors in law made at the trial which have been pointed out above. The test to be applied is found in the words of Kerwin J., giving the judgment of the court in Schmidt v. The King (supra).\n\u2026 The meaning of these words has been considered in this Court in several cases, one of which is Gouin v. The King (1926) S.C.R. 539, from all of which it is clear that the onus rests on the Crown to satisfy the Court that the verdict would necessarily have been the same if the charge had been correct or if no evidence had been improperly admitted. The principles therein set forth do not differ from the rules set forth in a recent decision of the House of Lords in Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecutions (1944) A.C. 315, i.e., that the proviso that the Court of Appeal may dismiss the appeal if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred in convicting the accused assumes a situation where a reasonable jury, after being properly directed, would, on the evidence properly admissible, without doubt convict.\nAs, in my view, there should be a new trial, it is not desirable that the evidence should be discussed at any length. I do not think it can be said that a properly instructed jury acting honestly and reasonably might not have acquitted the appellant.\nFor the reasons stated above and particularly because of error in regard to the matters set out in the first, second, fifth and sixth grounds of appeal, I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial ordered.\nAppeal allowed; new trial ordered.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Alexandre Chevalier and G.

(Suppliant) Appellant;\nand\nHis Majesty The King (Respondent) Respondent.\n1950: May 15, 16; 1950: October 3.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J., and Rand, Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nContract\u2014Crown\u2014Coal Subsidy\u2014Emergency Coal Production Board\u2014 Whether notice to producers an offer\u2014acceptable by performance\u2014Regulations having force of law\u2014Whether powers conferred upon Board exercised.\nThe Emergency Coal Production Board, in view of the national emergency existing in respect of the production of coal, was under the authority of the War Measures Act, created by Order-in-Council P.C. 10674, November 23, 1942. The Board, under the direction of the Minister, was authorized to take measures necessary to maintain and stimulate the production of Canadian coal, among others, the rendering of financial assistance to such mines as it deemed proper to ensure their maximum or more efficient operation provided that in no case should it render such assistance where the net profits exceeded standard profits within the meaning of the Excess Profits Tax Act.\nPrior to April 1, 1944, the Board restricted payment of subsidies to mines being operated at a loss to an amount which in its opinion would permit a profit of 15 cents a ton. Then because of the increased wages and the cost of living bonus the operators had been called upon to pay, it by Circular Letter \"C.C. 152\" notified operators in the domestic fields of Alberta that it had approved payment of a flat production subsidy conditioned on an operator satisfying the Board that it was unable to absorb the increased costs and submitting specified data in support of its claim. The maximum subsidy for the Lethbridge area it fixed at 35 cents per ton and reserved to itself determination of the rate of subsidy to be advanced in each case.\nThe appellant claimed payment on the basis of 35 cents per ton instead of at the rate of 12 cents and 16 cents paid by the Board.\nHeld: the claim that the Board's Circular Letter C.C. 152 and the minutes of its meeting of April 18, 1944, constituted an offer to pay a subsidy of 35 cents per ton which appellant by extending its operations and increasing production accepted fails because the documents relied on do not constitute an offer in such terms.\nHeld, also that the evidence did not establish an intention on the part of the Board to make an offer which could be accepted by performance.\nHeld, that as to the plea the appellant had established its claim by reason of its compliance with regulations having the force of law\u2014P.C. 10674 had the force of law, but there was nothing in it, standing by itself, upon which the appellant's claim could be founded. Assuming, without deciding, that it empowered the Board to pass a general order of the nature contended, nothing in the record indicated that the Board had attempted to exercise such power.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court 1, dismissing a claim for the payment of additional subsidies on coal produced by it.\nG. H. Steer K.C. and James McCaig K.C. for the appellant.\nH. W. Riley K.C. and K. E. Eaton for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by:\nCartwright J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the late Mr. Justice O'Connor dismissing the claim of the appellant for additional subsidies on coal produced by it between April 1, 1944 and March 31, 1946. From April 1, 1944 to March 31, 1945 the appellant was paid a subsidy of 12 cents per net ton of marketable coal produced by it and from April 1, 1945 to March 31, 1946 a subsidy of 16 cents per ton. An additional 17\u00bd cents per ton was claimed for the first of these periods and an additional 19 cents for the second.\nThe appellant's claim is put forward on two alternative grounds. The first is that by contract between the Suppliant and His Majesty, represented by the Emergency Coal Production Board, (hereinafter referred to as the Board) the Suppliant is entitled to the payments claimed. The alternative ground is that by virtue of the Order-in-Council creating the Board and certain actions of the Board taken thereunder the Suppliant has a statutory right to be paid the amounts claimed.\nUnder the authority of the War Measures Act, Order-in-Council P.C. 10674 dated November 23, 1942 was passed. This Order recites the existence of a national emergency in respect of the production of coal and the necessity of stimulating production. It creates the Board and provides inter alia:\n3. (1) The Board shall be responsible, under the direction of the Minister, for taking all such measures as are necessary or expedient for maintaining and stimulating the production of Canadian Coal and for ensuring an adequate and continuous supply thereof for all essential purposes and without restricting the generality of the foregoing, the Board shall have the power and duty, under the direction of the Minister, of * * *\n(e) rendering or procuring such financial assistance in such manner to such coal mine as the Board deems proper, for the purpose of ensuring the maximum or more efficient operation of such mine; provided that the Board shall not render or procure any financial assistance, except capital assistance, in any case where the net profits of operation exceed standard profits within the meaning of the Excise Profits Tax Act.\n(m) doing such acts and things as are ancillary or incidental to exercise or discharge of any of the foregoing powers or duties.\n4. (2) The Board may hold its meetings and conduct its business and proceedings in such manner as the Board may from time to time determine.\n(4) The Board may exercise its powers and duties by order.\n10. The Board shall report to the Minister as and when required to do so by the Minister, shall keep the Minister advised of the principles it is following in exercising the powers and duties conferred or imposed upon it by this order and shall refrain from doing all such things as the Minister may, in writing, from time to time direct. Section 7 provides that any person who contravenes or fails to observe any order shall be guilty of an offence and liable to fine or imprisonment.\nSection 1(d) defines order as follows:\n\"Order\" means and includes any general or specific order, requirement, instruction, prescription, prohibition, restriction or limitation made or issued in writing by or on behalf of or under authority of the Board in pursuance of any power conferred by or under this order.\nBy other clauses of section 3, very wide powers are given to the Board including power to cause mines to be opened and operated, to prohibit the operation of mines where production is insufficient to justify the employment of the labour and equipment involved, to direct methods of operation, to suspend laws as to conditions of employment and to take possession of coal, lands, buildings and other property.\nPrior to the 1st of April, 1944, the Board pursued a policy as to the payment of subsidies, referred to in the argument before us as \"The form F4 Policy\" under which payment of subsidy was restricted to mines which were being operated at a loss and the subsidy consisted of such amount as, in the opinion of the Board, would permit such mines to make a profit of 15 cents per ton.\nIn the last quarter of 1943 an increase in the wages payable to coal miners had been authorized and the cost-of-living bonus, which had theretofore been paid by the Government, had been added to the wages payable by the operators. To compensate the operators for these increased labour costs an increase in the price of coal had been authorized, but it appears to have been the view of the Board that in some cases this increase in price would not amount to a sufficient compensation.\nIt appears that by March 1944, in the area in which the Suppliant operated, the coal fields were in surplus production and the Board decided upon a new policy which was set out in a Minute No. 2A made at a meeting of the Board on March 23, 1944 which reads as follows:\nMinute No. 2(a): Proposed New Form of Subsidy Western Domestic Fields.\nThe Chairman advised that since the last meeting considerable work had been done to determine a fair basis of subsidy to cover the increased costs incurred by operators over which they had no control due to wage increases and absorption of the cost of living bonus in the basic wage rate. Independent calculations by different methods resulted in the following tentative basis of subsidy:\n(i) Approved coal mine operators in the fields indicated to be entitled to a maximum production subsidy as follows:\nSubsidy per Net Ton\nDistrict of Marketable Coal Produced\nEdmonton .................................................................................. 65c\nDrumheller ................................................................................. 30c\nCamrose (Shaft only) ................................................................ 30c\nLethbridge ................................................................................. 35c\nCoalspur (Shaft only)................................................................. 35c\nSaunders ................................................................................... 35c\nSaskatchewan Field (Shaft only) .............................................. 15c\n(ii) Alternatively, subsidy may be computed based on the average subsidy approved for payment on Form F-4A for the months of October, November and December, 1943, plus the uncompensated proportion of Cost of Living Bonus.\nSubsidy payable to be whichever is the less of (i) and (ii).\nIn discussion, it was agreed that this scheme should have the effect of keeping efficient mines in operation and should encourage less efficient operations to reduce costs sufficiently to enable them to maintain operations at the flat rates of subsidy set.\nThe members approved putting the scheme into force for the fiscal year April 1, 1944, to March 31, 1945, operators to be required to submit cost returns on a similar basis to form F-4A on a quarterly basis and rates of subsidy to be subject to review at the end of every three months.\nSubsidy may be reduced if upon review the profit is greater than that allowed under the company's Standard Profits.\nThis Minute was not communicated to the Suppliant, and the Suppliant did not know of its existence until the examination for discovery of an officer of the Respondent in February 1947.\nThe appellant had not been in receipt of any subsidy under the Form F-4 policy and had not made any application for subsidy prior to April 1944. On April 8, 1944 the appellant addressed a letter to the Coal Controller, who was chairman of the Board, reading as follows:\nWill you please give us all information on the payment of the recently announced coal subsidy to be paid to coal operators. It is our understanding that a subsidy of 35 cents per ton will be paid on Lethbridge coal but no doubt there will be some governing factors that we wish to acquaint ourselves with so that our monthly statements can be kept in line. An early reply will be much appreciated.\nIn reply to this the appellant received a telegram dated April 12, 1944 saying \"(Reference your letter April eighth) Re. Production subsidy, the following letter being air- mailed to-day to Coal mine operators in the Domestic Fields of Alberta\" * * * the telegram then quoted in full the following letter C.C. 152 which was in due course received by the appellant.\nC.C. 152 When Replying\nRefer to File................\nCANADA\nEMERGENCY COAL PRODUCTION BOARD\nOttawa, Ontario,\nApril 11, 1944.\nVia Air Mail\nTo Coal Mine Operators in the Domestic Fields of Alberta\nGentlemen,\nRe: Production Subsidy\nThe Board has approved payment of a flat rate production subsidy as from April 1, 1944, on coal production of approved operators in the \"domestic\" fields of Alberta, such subsidy being based upon wage increases authorized by Government and not compensated by authorized price increases, plus the previously compensated portion of the cost of living bonus now incorporated in the wage scale. The subsidy is payable as an amount per net ton of coal production.\nThe conditions under which the subsidy will be provided are as follows:\n1. An operator to be eligible for subsidy must show, to the satisfaction of the Board, that he is unable to absorb the wage increases and cost of living bonus referred to above. Operators who, on March 31, 1944, were in receipt of subsidy in accordance with Form F-4A need not make fresh submissions other than a direct application to be placed on the new basis of subsidy.\n2. Operators applying for subsidy for the first time must submit such data as is available in support of the claim, including a recent audited financial statement, and statement of costs. (This will not be necessary if already filed with the Board or the Coal Controller.)\n3. Operators approved for this subsidy will be required to submit, in duplicate, monthly, a sworn statement showing the net tons (of 2,000 lbs.) of marketable coal produced from their mining operation for the period. This may include coal used under colliery boilers and employee's coal. Coal purchased for resale must not be included in such claims, except as provided in (4). In addition, operators under subsidy will be required to submit, for information, a quarterly statement of costs and revenues on a form which will be supplied later.\nClaims must be submitted not later than the 15th of the following month.\n4. Operators may include tonnages of coal produced by others under contract from leases owned by the operator. Operators will be held responsible for notifying any such contractors that they (the operators) are claiming subsidy on such production. The Board will not entertain claims for subsidy from the contractors, who must look to the operator for any recompense. 5. Subsidy will be discontinued if it is found that it is being employed to enable the operator to cut prices below those which have been established as fair and reasonable for the grade of coal produced.\n6. No subsidy will be paid until the operator has supplied supporting data in a form satisfactory to the Board, and has been approved for subsidy.\n7. In the case of those operators who were in receipt of subsidy in accordance with Form F-4A during the last three months of the calendar year 1943, the subsidy applicable as from April 1, 1944, will be the lesser of items (i) and (ii) hereunder:\n(i) A maximum flat rate subsidy applicable to underground mines only, as follows:\nSubsidy Per Net Ton\nArea of Marketable Coal Produced\nEdmonton .................................................................................. 65 cents\nDrumheller ................................................................................. 30 \"\nCamrose .................................................................................... 30 \"\nLethbridge ................................................................................. 35 \"\nCoalspur ................................................................................... 35 \"\nSaunders .................................................................................. 35 \"\nOperators in districts not mentioned above will take the rate of subsidy applicable to the area mentioned with which they are most closely related by reason of operating conditions, grade of coal and market areas served, or\n(ii) The average of subsidy approved (after adjustments) for payment, per net ton of marketable coal produced, under Form F-4A for October, November and December, 1943, plus the previously compensated portion of the cost of living bonus now incorporated in the wage scale. The Board will determine the rate of subsidy to be advanced.\nApproved operators not on F-4A subsidy during the last quarter of 1943 will receive subsidy at the rates indicated in subsection (i) or such lesser rate as the Board may determine.\n8. The Board further directs that in no case will subsidy be provided which will result in net profits of operation exceeding Standard Profits within the meaning of the Excess Profits Tax Act, consequently all interim payments of subsidy will be considered as accountable advances subject to final adjustments after receipt and consideration of the operator's audited financial statement for his full financial year.\n9. The new flat rate subsidy will replace any subsidies paid prior to April 1, 1944.\nYours very truly,\nE. J. Brunning,\nChairman\nOn April 13, 1944, a copy of C.C. 152 was sent by the Chairman of the Board to the Minister, together with a memorandum dated April 13, 1944. These were stated to be for the information of the Minister in anticipation of a meeting to be held on the following Monday, at which the Alberta Coal Committee was to present a brief to members of the Cabinet. The last mentioned memorandum reads as follows:\nDEPARTMENT OF MUNITIONS AND SUPPLY\nOTTAWA, CANADA\nApril 13, 1944.\nMemorandum re Production Subsidies\nThe reasons for withdrawing the previous type of subsidy, reported on Form F-4, are as follows:\n(1) The Western domestic coal fields are now in surplus production. In other words, the coal emergency no longer exists in these areas.\n(2) To continue paying to operators all their losses, plus fifteen cents a ton profit, would result in keeping the high cost mines in operation, thus depriving the efficient low cost mines of sales, which in turn would result in bringing these mines down to a loss position, as there is insufficient demand for coal to keep all mines operating steadily throughout the year. In other words, to continue this form of subsidy would be subsidizing inefficiency.\n(3) An analysis of the profit or loss position of the individual mines in the domestic field show that they range from a profit of nearly one dollar per ton to a loss position requiring Government assistance amounting to $2.50 per ton.\n(4) Great difficulty has been experienced in administrating F-4 form of subsidy due to the continual controversy with operators on questions of fair and reasonable depreciation, depletion and the inclusion of excessive future development costs in current cost of production.\n(5) The payment of losses plus a profit to operators provides no incentive to either the owners or to labour to reduce costs.\nThe new flat rate subsidy plan obviates the above weaknesses by\n(i) Placing each operator in the same relatively competitive position as existed prior to the payment of production subsidies. This has been accomplished by basing the flat rate subsidy on the amount of assistance required per ton of coal produced to reimburse the operator for the increases in labour rates brought about by direction of the War Labour Board, also an item to offset the increase of cost due to the operator being required to absorb the cost-of-living bonus as of February 15, 1944. This bonus was previously paid by The Government.\n(ii) As the flat rate subsidy is calculated on the average tons per man day produced in the respective fields, it will be necessary for excessively high cost producers either to reduce their cost or close down.\n(iii) The new subsidy should provide the necessary incentive to operators to reduce costs as they can retain all profits that accrued from the operation including the subsidy up to an amount not exceeding standard profits within the meaning of the Excess Profits Tax Act.\nCoal Controller. It appears that at the meeting with the members of the Cabinet a further meeting was arranged which was held in the office of the Coal Controller at Ottawa on the following day, April 18, 1944, between representatives of the Alberta Coal Committee and the Coal Controller. The Alberta Coal Committee represented the United Mine-workers of Alberta and the coal operators of Alberta, including the appellant.\nThe Minutes of this meeting, which are very lengthy, were filed as Exhibit 6 at the trial. A copy of the memorandum of April 13, 1944, quoted above, was read to the meeting and was copied in full into the minutes. A copy of these minutes was shortly thereafter sent to the appellant. In July 1944 the appellant made application for subsidy supported by statements of its operations during the last three months of 1943, and in the minutes of a meeting of the Board held on July 27, 1944 there is the following entry:\nApplications supported by the necessary data as per terms and conditions set out in Circulars C.C. 151, 152 and 175 had been received from various operations and it was agreed that subsidy payments be made as accountable advances pending receipt of auditors' statements, covering the three-month basic periods used to determine rate of subsidy applicable to each operation.\nCompany Rate Per Ton\n1. Lethbridge Collieries Ltd. ................................................... .12\nBy letter of August 7, 1944 the Board notified the appellant that its application to be placed on Flat Rate Subsidy as from 1st April 1944 was provisionally approved, that the rate so approved was determined to be 12 cents per ton, that payments would be made on that basis and would be treated as accountable advances until an auditors certified statement covering the last quarter of 1943 had been received and reviewed by the Board. The Appellant replied on September 1, 1944 pointing out that other operators in the Lethbridge Field were receiving amounts \"varying up to 35 cents per ton\". The letter continues:\nIt seems to us that wage increases not compensated for applies to all operations alike, and as 35 cents per ton had been decided upon as the rate applicable in the Lethbridge field, we set up our books in April, the beginning of our financial year, on this basis and on the advice of our chartered accountant, but have since made an adjustment to correct this mistake. Will you please define for us the items covered by the 12 cents per ton and advise if there is liable to be any change in this figure depending upon our entire year's operations.\nThe Board replied on September 13, 1944 as follows:\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 1, 1944.\nThe rate of 35 cents per ton was established for the Lethbridge field as the maximum amount required to cover wage increases authorized by the National War Labour Board and not compensated by price increases, plus the previously compensated portion of the Cost of Living Bonus, now incorporated in the wage scale.\nHowever, due to the fact that conditions under which different mines operate, vary considerably, operating costs therefore also vary and not necessarily as a result of inefficiency. Therefore it is necessary for this Board to examine each operator's position and determine what rate of flat rate subsidy is required to help him meet the above-mentioned costs, but in no case will such subsidy exceed the maximum rate set for the field.\nFurther, it is the policy of this Board that in no case will subsidy be provided which will result in net profits of operation exceeding Standard Profits within the meaning of the Excess Profits Tax Act, consequently, all interim payments of subsidy will be considered as accountable advances subject to final adjustment after receipt and consideration of the operator's audited financial statement for his full financial year.\nIn your case the rate of 12 cents per ton was established from the data you submitted covering the basic three-month period ending December 31, 1943.\nThe appellant telegraphed to the Board on September 18, 1944 as follows:\nRe your letter thirteenth paragraph three does this mean if the rate of twelve cents established fails to bring our years operation to show standard profit will the rate be increased to provide for this or until the thirty-five cents is reached.\nThe Board replied on September 19, 1944 as follows:\nReplying to your telegram of the 18th instant, I would refer you to my letter of September 13 and also Circular C.C. 152 dated April 11, 1944, both of which should clarify the basis on which the present flat rate subsidy assistance is payable.\nThe present rate of 12 cents payable to your operation which has been approved by this Board is not subject to revision. However, if at the end of your fiscal year, it is found that revenue has not been sufficient to meet the costs as outlined in C.C. 152, it will be in order for your Company to make a submission to this Board for its consideration.\nThere was further correspondence which does not materially affect the matters in dispute. In July 1945 the rate of subsidy was changed from 12 cents to 16 cents, the change to be effective from April 1, 1945.\nIn support of the appellant's claim in contract it is said that an offer made by the Board is to be found in Circular Letter C.C. 152 and in the statements made by the Chair- man of the Board at the meeting of April 18, 1944, that this offer was addressed to all, and capable of acceptance by any, of the Coal Mine Operators in the Domestic Fields of Alberta, that the offer was to pay a definitely ascertainable sum to any of such operators who performed specified conditions and that the appellant performed the conditions thereby accepting the offer.\nThe appellant seeks to interpret C.C. 152 and the statements made at the meeting of April 18th as an offer made to the appellant, in common with other coal mine operators in the same area, to pay a subsidy of 35 cents per ton subject only to the proviso that if as a result of such payment the profits of the operator receiving it would exceed its standard profits as determined for the purpose of Excess Profits Tax, the subsidy payment should be reduced to such figure as would permit the operator to make its standard profits but no more.\nThe appellant takes the position that the consideration which was required of it was that it should continue to mine coal and to endeavour to increase its production, that it did this, and that this was a performance of the condition prescribed in the offer and constituted an acceptance of the offer and that this performance coupled with the making of a claim for subsidy was a sufficient notification to the Board of the acceptance of its offer by the appellant. The appellant contends that not only did it continue to mine coal, but that it extended its operations and increased its production at considerable additional cost per ton to itself.\nThe appellant emphasizes the fact that it employed a number of inexperienced miners which necessitated the employment of a fire boss for every ten men instead of every sixty men, and that, instead of driving to the boundaries, it reversed this and took the coal in advance instead of in retreat. It is said that all this was done to increase production, but that it added substantially to the cost per ton. The learned trial Judge found it to be a fact that this was done and there is ample evidence to support his finding. It may be observed that this method of procedure on the part of the appellant appears to have brought about a result different from that which the Board hoped to accomplish by its change in policy as to the payment of subsidy. The Board's intention as reported to the Minister was to increase the efficiency of operation in the various mines, whereas the course pursued by the appellant tended to decrease its efficiency of operation and to increase its production cost per ton.\nIn my view, it nowhere appears in the evidence that the Board made to the appellant any such offer as that for which the appellant contends. It is first necessary to examine the circular letter C.C. 152. The letter opens with a statement that the subsidy is based upon wage increases authorized by the Government, and not compensated by authorized price increases, plus the previously compensated portion of the cost-of-living bonus now incorporated in the wage scale. It provides that an operator to be eligible for subsidy must show to the satisfaction of the Board that it is unable to absorb such wage increases and cost-of-living bonus. It provides that the maximum flat rate subsidy in the Lethbridge area shall be 35 cents per ton and that \"the Board will determine the rate of subsidy to be advanced.\" The concluding words of paragraph 7 are:\nApproved operators not on F-4A subsidy during the last quarter of 1943 will receive subsidy at the rates indicated in subsection (i) or such lesser rate as the Board may determine.\nThe appellant was one of the operators referred to.\nI do not think that C.C. 152 is susceptible of the interpretation for which the appellant contends. Had it been the intention of the Board to say that it offered to pay to all operators in the Lethbridge area whichever should be the lesser of either (a) 35 cents per ton, or (b) such amount as would bring the profits of such operator up to the amount of its standard profits; it would have been easy to do so. The purpose of the subsidy is not indicated as being to raise the operator's profits to its standard profits, but to compensate it for the difference between the wage increases including the cost-of-living bonus and the permitted increase in the price of coal.\nWhile C.C. 152 can not be said to be expressed in terms of perfect clarity its meaning appears to me to be as follows: In the case of each of the operators to whom the letter is addressed the Board will calculate, from the information supplied by such operator, the amount per ton of coal produced which, in the opinion of the Board, is necessary to compensate such operator for the difference between the increased costs of labour, including the cost of living bonus, and the authorized advance in the price of coal and will pay such amount by way of subsidy to the operator, always provided that such amount does not exceed the maximum per ton for the area in which the operator is located. The amount so paid is to be regarded as an accountable advance and if it appears from audited financial statements at the end of the operator's financial year that the operator has, as a result of the payment of subsidy, earned more than its standard profits the excess over such standard profits is to be repaid to the Board. The intention of the Board to reserve to itself the right to determine the rate of subsidy, if any, to be paid in each individual case is, I think, clearly expressed. In the case of the appellant the Board determined to pay and did pay subsidies at the rates of 12 cents and 16 cents respectively.\nEven if the minutes of the meeting of April 18th could be regarded as setting out an offer by the Board I can not find in them any offer in the terms claimed by the appellant.\nIf I am right in my construction of C.C. 152 and of the minutes of April 18, 1944, the appellant's claim, in so far as it is based upon contract, would fail because the documents relied upon do not contain an offer in the terms for which the appellant contends. There is, I think, a further difficulty in the way of a claim based upon contract.\nI agree with the learned trial Judge that the evidence does not establish an intention on the part of the Board to make an offer which could be accepted by performance. It is the factual basis which is lacking. No doubt, as was said by Pickford L.J. in Davies v. Rhondda District Urban Council 2, \"If one person says to another 'If you will do so-and-so I will pay you so much money' and the man does it that constitutes a contract.\" But I do not think that on the record in this case it could be found that the Board was ever in the position of saying to the appellant \"If you will go on mining coal I will pay you so much money\". Rather, I think, the Board went no further than to indicate that it proposed to follow a certain policy as to payment of subsidies but reserved to itself throughout the right to say what amount, if any, it would pay from time to time to any operator.\nI have not overlooked the appellant's argument based on estoppel but I can not find in the minutes of April 18, 1944 or in any of the other documents upon which reliance was placed any representation by the Respondent that the meaning of C.C. 152 was to make an offer in the terms for which the appellant contends. It therefore becomes unnecessary to examine the authorities to which Mr. Eaton referred us in support of his argument that the plea of estoppel could not succeed because the alleged representations did not relate to presently existing facts and were not sufficiently clear and unambiguous.\nIt is next necessary to examine the alternative basis on which the appellant's claim is put forward. It is said that, by orders having the force of law, the Board provided that the appellant, upon performing the condition of continuing to mine coal, should be entitled to the payments for which it makes claim.\nThere is no doubt that P.C. 10674 was in force throughout the relevant periods, and that it had the force of law, but there is nothing in this Order-in-Council, standing by itself, upon which the appellant's claim could be founded.\nThe judgment of this Court in Reference as to the Validity of the Regulations in relation to Chemicals 3, and particularly at page 19 shows that the Governor General in Council has power to delegate the powers conferred upon him by the War Measures Act. At page 19, Rinfret J., as he then was, in whose judgment Taschereau J. concurred states:\nThat Act conferred on the Governor in Council subordinate legislative powers; and it is conceded that it was within the legislative jurisdiction of Parliament so to do. In fact, delegation to other agencies is, in itself, one of the things that the Governor in Council may, under the Act, deem \"advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada\" in the conduct of the war. The advisability of the delegation is in the discretion of the Governor in Council; and once the discretion is exercised, the resulting enactment is a law by which every court is bound in the same manner and to the same extent as if Parliament had enacted it, or as if it were part of the common law\u2014subject always to the conditions already stated.\nIf it could be shown that by P.C. 10674 the Governor-in-Council had delegated to the Board the power to make, and the Board in turn had made, an order providing that during the period in question, the appellant was entitled to receive a subsidy of 35 cents per ton on the coal which it produced or such lesser subsidy as would bring its profits up to its standard profits but no more; then the appellant would appear to have a right to payment which would be enforceable by Petition of Right under Section 19(d) of the Exchequer Court Act.\nIt is necessary, therefore, first to examine Order-in-Council 10674 to ascertain what powers have been delegated to the Board. It will be observed that the word \"Order\" is defined as including any general or specific order made or issued in writing by or on behalf of or under authority of the Board in pursuance of any power conferred by or under P.C. 10674. The Board is given the power and duty under the direction of the Minister of:\n3. (e) rendering or procuring such financial assistance in such manner to such coal mine as the Board deems proper, for the purpose of ensuring the maximum or more efficient operation of such mine; provided that the Board shall not render or procure any financial assistance, except capital assistance, in any case where the net profits of operation exceed standard profits within the meaning of the Excise Profits Tax Act.\n(m) doing such acts and things as are ancillary or incidental to exercise or discharge of any of the foregoing powers or duties.\nSubsection 4 of Section 4 provides that the Board may exercise its powers and duties by order. Section 7 makes it an offence to contravene or fail to observe any order.\nI think it very doubtful whether on a proper construction P.C. 10674 empowers the Board to pass a general order having the force of law providing that a subsidy of so much per ton should be paid to all operators in a certain area. The wording of Section 3(e) seems rather to contemplate that the Board shall consider the situation of individual mines. The power and duty given to the Board is that of rendering \"such financial assistance in such manner to such coal mine as the Board deems proper for the purpose of ensuring the maximum or more efficient operation of such mine.\" The Board has, I think, rightly interpreted its duties as requiring it to pass upon the amount of subsidy to be paid to each individual mine, and while it announced the policy which it proposed to follow in various areas, it seems to me to have retained to itself the power and indeed the duty of passing upon each individual case.\nAssuming for the moment that P.C. 10674 does confer upon the Board a jurisdiction to pass a general order providing for the payment of subsidies as above suggested, I cannot find anything in the record to indicate that the Board attempted to exercise such power. The documents relied upon by the appellant on this branch of the argument appear to be the Minute of the 23rd of March, 1944, the memorandum to the Minister of April 13, 1944 and Circular letter C.C. 152.\nI do not think that the Minute of 23rd March, 1944 can be properly regarded as being intended by the Board to be, or as being, an order having the force of law. It does not appear that a copy of it was sent to the Minister, or that it was published in the Gazette or elsewhere. It was not communicated to those upon whom the appellant argues it conferred rights. It does not purport to be in the form of an order. I cannot think that a document of this sort and in this form can be regarded as having the force of law and being effective, without more, to authorize and require payments to be made out of the public treasury.\nThe memorandum to the Minister of April 13, 1944 is simply a communication for the information of the Minister which does not purport to be in the form or to have the effect of an order.\nCircular letter C.C. 152 does not appear to be intended to have the effect of an order, but even if it were otherwise, it is my opinion, for the reasons set out at length above, that properly construed it does not provide for payment of subsidies beyond those which the appellant has received.\nIn my view assuming, without deciding, that the Board had power under P.C. 10674 to enact an order of the sort for which the appellant contends, it has not attempted to do so. I think therefore that the appellant's alternative claim cannot succeed.\nFor the above reasons, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Milner, Steer, Dyde, Poirier, Martland and Layton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F. P. Varcoe.\n1 [1950] Ex. C.R. 1.\n2 [1918] 87 L.J. K.B. 166 at 168.\n3 [1943] S.C.R. 1.\n",

G. Nolan K.C. for the appellant.\nGeo. H. Steer K.C. and D. Rae Fisher for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin, J. was delivered by:\nKerwin J.:\u2014On April 21, 1948, the appellant as optionor entered into an agreement with the respondents as optionees and it is upon the covenant contained in clause 3 of this agreement that the present action is brought by the former against the latter. The relevant parts of the agreement read as follows:\nWHEREAS by Indenture of Lease dated the 6th day of February, 1948, John Konstantin Witiuk of Red Deer, in the Province of Alberta, granted and leased unto Albert Edward Silliker all petroleum and natural gas and related hydrocarbons (hereinafter called \"the leased substances\") within, upon or under the North East Quarter of Section Thirty-one (31), in Township Forty-nine (49), Range Twenty-six (26), West of the Fourth Meridian, in the Province of Alberta, reserving unto Canadian Pacific Railway Company all coal (hereinafter called \"the demised lands\"), for a term of Twenty-one (21) years from the date of the said lease and so long thereafter as the leased substances are produced from the leased lands of the Lessee shall conduct operations thereon for the discovery and\/or recovery of the leased substances;\nAND WHEREAS by Assignment in writing dated the 23rd day of February, 1948, the said Albert Edward Silliker granted, assigned, conveyed and set over unto the Optionor the said Lease and all his rights and interests thereunder and in and to the leased substances and all benefits and advantages of him, the said Silliker, derived or to be derived from the said lease, together with the unexpired term of the said lease;\nAND WHEREAS the Optionor has agreed to grant to the Optionees an option to acquire a sub-lease of the leased substances within, upon and under that part of the demised lands consisting of Legal Subdivisions Nine (9) and Ten (10) thereof upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.\nNOW THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSETH that in consideration of the premises and of the sum of One ($1.00) Dollar, now paid by the Optionees to the Optionor (receipt of which is hereby by the Optionor acknowledged) and of the covenants of the Optionees herein contained, IT IS HEREBY MUTUALLY COVENANTED AND AGREED by and between the parties hereto as follows:\n1. THE Optionor hereby grants to the Optionees an option exercisable within the time and in the manner hereinafter set forth to acquire a sublease of the leased substances within, upon and under the following lands, namely:\nLegal Subdivisions Nine (9) and Ten (10), of Section Thirty-one (31), in Township Forty-nine (49), Range Twenty-six (26), West of the Fourth Meridian, in the Province of Alberta, reserving unto Canadian Pacific Railway Company all coal (hereinafter called \"the sub-demised lands\").\n2. THE said option may be exercised on or before the 1st day of August, 1948, and may be exercised within the said time by the Optionees erecting upon the sub-demised lands the necessary derrick complete with rig irons, boiler and engine, and installing all drilling machinery, and actually spudding in and commencing the work of drilling a well for the discovery of petroleum on the sub-demised lands, and delivering or mailing to the optionor notice in writing of such exercise of the said option.\n3. THE Optionees covenant to exercise the option within the said period, in the manner aforesaid, and in the event of their neglect or failure so to do, the Optionor shall, despite the lapse of the said option, be entitled to exercise any remedies which may be legally available to him for the breach by the Optionees of this covenant, which the parties hereto agree is given and entered into by the Optionees as the substantial consideration for the granting of the said option.\n4. IN the event of the exercise of the said option, the Optionor shall grant to the Optionees a sub-lease of the sub-demised lands in the form set forth in Schedule \"A\" hereto attached, and each of the parties shall forthwith after the exercise of the option execute and deliver the said sub-lease. The head lease from Witiuk to Silliker, referred to in the first recital, was really taken by the latter as agent and trustee for the appellant and associates, and the consideration therefor was the sum of $70,000 paid in cash, the reservation of certain royalties, and the covenant on behalf of the lessee to commence within six months from February 7, 1948, the drilling of a well for the leased substances and the carrying on of such drilling operations until such well should have reached the depth of 5,500 feet or the limestone should have been penetrated to a reasonable depth having regard to the geological situation, whichever should first occur, unless commercial production be sooner obtained; with a provision that upon payment of another $1,000 the time for drilling should be extended for another six months. As stated in the second recital, Silliker assigned the head lease to the appellant on February 23, 1948, and the record shows that this assignment was consented to by the original lessor. The third recital is of importance as it is there stated that the appellant has agreed to grant the respondents \"an option to acquire a sub-lease of the leased substances within, upon and under\" the described part of the lands \"upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.\" The next paragraph gives the consideration as not merely the sum of $1.00 but also \"the covenants of the optionees herein contained.\"\nBy clause numbered 1, the option is granted to acquire the sublease within the time and in the manner thereinafter in the agreement set forth. Clause 2 fixes the time as on or before August 1, 1948, and the manner is \"by the optionees erecting upon the subdemised lands the necessary derrick complete with rig irons, boiler and engine, and installing all drilling machinery, and actually spudding in and commencing the work of drilling a well.\" It will be noted that the optionees are merely to erect the derrick, etc., spud in, and commence the work of drilling a well. That is, so far as the exercise of the option is concerned, there is no obligation to continue drilling. Notice in writing of such exercise of the option is to be given. Clause 3 contains the covenant sued upon, which is stated to be the substantial consideration for the granting of the option. The covenant is by the optionees to exercise the option within the period and in the manner aforesaid, and \"in the event of their neglect or failure so to do, the optionor shall, despite the lapse of the said option, be entitled to exercise any remedies which may be legally available to him for the breach by the optionees of this covenant.\" It is to be noted that by clause 4 it is only in the event of the exercise of the option that the sublease according to Schedule \"A\" is to be executed and delivered by the parties.\nMuch was made on the argument of the use of the terms \"optionor\" and \"optionee\" in the agreement but this is but one circumstance bearing upon the proper construction of the document. The Appellate Division concluded that the case fell to be decided upon the principle of repugnancy, which was not raised until the oral argument of the appeal before the Appellate Division. The late Chief Justice Harvey, on behalf of the Court, adopted as binding the following statement of the principle by Lord Wrenbury for the Judicial Committee in Forbes v. Git 3.\nIf in a deed an earlier clause is followed by a later clause which destroys altogether the obligation created by the earlier clause, the later clause is to be rejected as repugnant and the earlier clause prevails. * * * But if the later clause does not destroy but only qualifies the earlier, then the two are to be read together and effect is to be given to the intention of the parties as disclosed by the deed as a whole.\nThe foundation of the rule is explained in the dissenting judgment of Duff J. (concurred in by Sir Louis Davies) in this Court 4, and a number of the decided cases are referred to. Applying the statement of the principle by the Judicial Committee to the case at bar, in my opinion there is no repugnancy between clauses 1 and 3 of the agreement. Nothing is to be gained by comparing the provisions of the agreement before us with other documents in other cases and the respondents' case could not be put higher than Mr. Steer's argument that clause 3 deprived the optionees of the choice previously given by clause 1. Now, not only was there no obligation previously imposed, but the promise of the optionees was explicit and it was further provided that the optionor should be entitled to his remedies although the option had lapsed. Clause 3 does not destroy clause 1, and the two are to be read together. It is apparent from the evidence that, holding a lease of the leased substances in the northeast quarter of section 31, comprising 160 acres, for which, on February 6, 1948, the sum of $70,000 had been paid, the optionor, while willing to give the optionees six months to exercise the option with relation to 80 acres by commencing the work of drilling and giving the specified notice, had included in the agreement a term whereby the optionees covenanted to do these very things.\nHaving notified the appellant that they would not fulfil their covenant, the respondents have breached it and are liable in damages. The trial judge awarded the sum of $54,550, being $53,550, the admitted cost of drilling a well to a depth of 5,500 feet (although the form of lease attached as Schedule \"A\" to the agreement required a depth of 6,000 feet), and an additional $1,000, being the sum paid by the appellant to the head lessor for an extension of six months in accordance with the provisions of the head lease. In addition to paying $1,000, the appellant negotiated with others to drill but, according to him, he had to deal with the 160 acres and not merely the 80 acres referred to in the agreement sued on. The evidence does not disclose the result of these negotiations or what else, if anything, the appellant did. The allowance by the trial judge was made on the basis of reading together the head lease, the agreement in question, and the form of lease attached thereto and construing the covenant sued upon as one to dig a well. I am unable to agree that this is the proper way of approaching the matter. Clause 4 of the agreement provides that the optionor shall grant to the optionees the sublease \"in the event of the exercise of the said option\" and I cannot read the document as equivalent to a simple agreement for a lease. Such a result could follow only if the option had in fact been exercised. It appears to me that clause 3 was drawn having in mind that the option might not be exercised and provided that, if the optionees neglected or failed to exercise it, certain results should follow. It was only if the option was exercised that the lease was to be entered into. Notwithstanding that the appellant's case was put as if the respondents' covenant was to dig a well, which as I have indicated is not in my view its proper construction, the appellant is entitled to more than nominal damages. The proper measure is not the cost of performance to the respondents but the value of performance to the appellant: Erie County Natural Gas and Fuel Co. v. Carroll 5. Adapting Lord Atkinson's language at the foot of page 118, it was the appellant's business to show the damages and he cannot be permitted to recover damages on guesswork or surmise. The evidence discloses, and the trial judge finds, that the chance of obtaining oil on drilling is remote although it cannot be completely ruled out. However, it was on the basis of the covenant being to drill a well that the trial judge assessed the damages, and the substratum for that allowance being absent, there is nothing in the record to warrant fixing the damages at more than the $1,000 paid by the appellant. It is true that this payment kept in force the head lease for another six months and, the respondents having no further rights, the entire benefit of that payment enured to the advantage only of the appellant, but it was a reasonable step for the latter to take, and it should be held that the amount of that payment is the sum necessary to place the appellant in the same position as he would have been in if the covenant had been performed: Wertheim v. Chicoutimi Pulp Co.6.\nThe special circumstance of the appellant being compelled to pay $1,000 for a further renewal of six months of the head lease was known to the respondents. That payment naturally resulted from the respondents' breach of their covenant and since they contemplated, or ought to have contemplated, the consequences which proximately followed the breach, they are liable to pay damages according to the rule in Hadley v. Baxendale7. To put the matter in another way, the $1,000 damages are such as are the natural and probable result of the breach. In view of the breach found to have been committed in this case, Cunningham v. Insinger 8 and the decisions referred to in Kinkel v. Hyman 9 are quite distinguishable.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed and judgment directed to be entered for the appellant for the sum of $1,000. He is entitled to his costs of the action and of the appeal to this Court but the respondents should have their costs in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta.\nLocke J. (dissenting):\u2014By the agreement of April 21, 1948, made between the parties to this action wherein the appellant is described as the optionor and the respondents the optionees, after reciting the grant of the head lease by Witiuk to Silliker and its subsequent assignment by the latter to the appellant, it is said that:\nThe optionor has agreed to grant to the optionees an option to acquire a sublease of the leased substances\nunder part of the lands referred to in that lease. This is followed by a statement that in consideration \"of the premises and of the sum of $1.00 now paid by the optionees to the optionor and of the covenants of the optionees herein contained, it is hereby mutually covenanted and agreed by and between the parties hereto as follows:\n1. The optionor hereby grants to the Optionees an option exercisable within the time and in the manner hereinafter set forth to acquire a sub-lease of the leased substances within, upon and under.\nthe lands referred to and by paragraph 2 it is provided that:\n2. The said option may be exercised on or before the 1st day of August, 1948, and may be exercised within the said time by the optionees erecting upon the sub-demised lands.\nthe necessary drilling equipment and commencing the drilling of a well for the discovery of petroleum:\nand delivering or mailing to the optionor notice in writing of such exercise of the said option.\nAs a schedule to this agreement there is the form of the sub-lease to be granted by the appellant to the respondents in the event of the exercise by them of the option, and in this document it is said that the appellant has granted to the respondents \"an option to acquire a sub-lease of the sub-demised lands\" and that the respondents have exercised the said option by, inter alia, the spudding in and commencing the work of drilling a well for the discovery of petroleum upon the said sub-demised lands and are entitled to the grant of the sub-lease aforesaid.\nHaving granted to the respondents the right to acquire a sub-lease of the premises which might be exercised at any time between the date of the instrument and August 1, 1948, in the prescribed manner at their will, the agreement further provided:\n3. The Optionees covenant to exercise the option within the said period, in the manner aforesaid, and in the event of their neglect or failure so to do, the optionor shall, despite the lapse of the said option, be entitled to exercise any remedies which may be legally available to him for the breach by the optionees of this covenant, which the parties hereto agree is given and entered into by the optionees as the substantial consideration for the granting of the said option.\n4. In the event of the exercise of the said option, the optionor shall grant to the optionees a sub-lease of the sub-demised lands in the form set forth in Schedule \"A\" hereto attached, and each of the parties shall forthwith after the exercise of the option execute and deliver the said sub-lease.\nThus, while for a valuable consideration vesting in the respondents the right of acquiring a sub-lease within a limited time if they desired to do so, the agreement purported to impose upon them an absolute obligation to exercise that right within the defined period, declared that they would be liable to the appellant for any failure to do so and obligated them to execute and deliver the form of sub-lease forthwith after the exercise of the option. The last mentioned covenant was not merely an agreement to enter into an agreement any of the material terms of which remained to be negotiated, but an obligation to execute and deliver an agreement, all the terms of which were settled, as to which in the event of default the appellant might resort to the remedy of specific performance or claim damages.\nThe question as to whether in construing the agreement paragraphs 3 and 4 are to be rejected as repugnant to the clauses granting the option which precede them was not raised before the learned trial judge and, accordingly, not considered by him. The judgment at the trial awarded damages against the respondents for their failure to exercise the option as required by paragraph 3 and to drill the well, which they would have been obligated to do under the terms of the sub-lease which they had covenanted to execute and deliver. By the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by the late Chief Justice of the Appellate Division this judgment has been set aside on the ground that paragraphs 3 and 4, being repugnant to the clause granting the option within the principle stated in Forbes v. Git 10, were to be rejected.\nThere is no ambiguity to be found in the terms of this agreement, in my opinion. Among the meanings assigned to the word \"option\" in the Oxford English Dictionary is \"the privilege (acquired on some consideration) of executing or relinquishing, as one may choose, within a specified period a commercial transaction on terms now fixed\" and it is in that sense that the word is used in transactions of the nature in question here. The language of the instrument is that in common use in granting such a right and is incapable of any meaning other than that the optionee may contract or refrain from doing so at will. The language of paragraphs 3 and 4 is equally clear that the optionees were bound to exercise the option within the defined period and in the prescribed manner and, having done so, to execute and deliver the sub-lease. In Forbes v. Git, supra at 259, Lord Wrenbury states the rule of construction as being that if in a deed an earlier clause is followed by a later clause which destroys altogether the obligation created by the earlier clause, the later clause is to be rejected as repugnant and the earlier clause prevails. Mr. Nolan, in his able argument for the appellant, contended that the rule so stated was inapplicable unless the repugnancy was to be found in covenants by the same person or persons and that accordingly in the present case where the inconsistency, if there is such, is between the grant by the optionor of the option and the covenant of the optionees to exercise it, it did not apply. The authorities do not, in my opinion, support this contention, nor do I think it was intended in the passage referred to in Forbes v. Git to state the rule in a manner inconsistent with the earlier authorities, but rather merely to state its application to the facts of that case. In the passage from Sheppard's Touchstone, 7th Ed. p. 88, referred to by Duff J. (as he then was) in Git v. Forbes 11, the rule is stated thus:\nThat in a deed if there be two clauses so totally repugnant to each other that they cannot stand together, the first shall be received and the latter rejected: wherein it differs from a will; for there of two such repugnant clauses the latter shall stand.\nA marginal note to this statement refers to Hardres' Reports at p. 94, where in the action of Cother v. Merrick (1657) Baron Nicholas is reported as saying:\nWhere there are two clauses in a deed of which the latter is contradictory to the former there the former shall stand.\nIn Blackstone's Commentaries (Lewis' Ed.) Book 2 p. 841, the law is stated in the terms employed in Sheppard's Touchstone. In Doe dem. Leicester v. Biggs 12, Mansfield C.J. states the rule as being that if there be a repugnancy, the first words in a deed, and the last words in a will, shall prevail.\nIn Bateson v. Gosling 13, Willes J. said:\nThe rule of law is clear, that, if there be two clauses or parts of a deed repugnant the one to the other, the first shall be received and the latter rejected, except there be some special reason for the contrary.\nHere the earlier clause which is expressed in the terms of a grant to the optionees gives them the option to acquire the sub-lease if they wish to do so, while the subsequent clauses purport to deprive them entirely of this right and render it obligatory upon them both to exercise the option and to execute the sub-lease. The right granted and the obligations imposed appear to me to be totally inconsistent and, in my view, the former must prevail and the latter be rejected.\nIt is said for the appellant that despite the language employed the dominant intention of the parties is apparent, this being to obligate the respondents to commence to drill the well within the prescribed period and to execute and deliver the sub-lease forthwith thereafter and to discharge their obligations under that document. To so interpret the agreement, however, involves rejecting the language of the preamble and of paragraph 1 above quoted and for this there is, in my opinion, no warrant. I am by no means satisfied that the interpretation which I think should be placed upon this agreement is in accordance with what was intended by the parties. Where, however, the language employed is free from ambiguity, we must give effect to it even though the result may not be that which both parties contemplated (Directors of Great Western Railway Co. v. Rous 14, per Lord Westbury at 660).\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\nCartwright J.:\u2014By lease dated February 6, 1948, one Witiuk granted and leased to an agent of the appellant, who duly assigned the lease to the appellant,\nAll the petroleum and natural gas and related hydrocarbons the exclusive right and privilege of prospecting and drilling for, taking, removing and selling the leased substances within, upon or under the said lands and of laying pipelines and building tanks, stations and structures necessary and convenient to take care of the said products or any of them, within, upon or under the following lands, namely:\nThe North East quarter of Section Thirty-one (31), Township Forty-nine (49), Range Twenty-Six (26), West of the Fourth Meridian, in the Province of Alberta, containing One Hundred and Sixty (160) acres more or less, reserving unto the Canadian Pacific Railway Company all coal.\nTO HAVE AND ENJOY the same for the term of twenty-one years from the date of acceptance hereof, and so long thereafter as the leased substances are produced from the leased lands or the Lessee shall conduct operations thereon for the discovery and\/or recovery of such leased substances.\nThis lease contains a covenant on the part of the lessee to commence the drilling of a well for the leased substances on the said lands within six months from the date of the lease and to diligently carry on such drilling operations until such well shall have reached a depth of 5,500 feet, or the limestone has been penetrated to a reasonable depth having regard to the geological situation, whichever should first occur, unless commercial production should be sooner obtained. There is a proviso permitting the lessee to obtain a six months' extension on payment to the lessor of $1000. The lease contains a right of re-entry for breach of the above convenant, subject to the provisions of paragraph 14 which reads as follows:\nPROVIDED HOWEVER and notwithstanding anything herein contained, the Lessee shall not be deemed to be in default on account of any delays in the commencement or interruption of drilling operations as provided under the terms of this agreement in the event such delay is caused directly or indirectly by reason of acts of King's enemies, acts of God, inclement weather, shortage of materials and labor due to military exigencies, Governmental priorities, inability of manufacturers to deliver materials, regulations or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of the Lessee.\nThe lease contains a covenant by the lessee to pay a royalty of 12\u00bd% of the current market value of the leased substances produced and marketed and other covenants which are not relevant to the questions raised on this appeal. It appears that the sum of $70,000 was paid to Witiuk for the lease and a further $2,500 was paid by the appellant to his agent for the assignment of the lease. The appellant also agreed to observe all the lessee's covenants.\nThe document on which this action is brought is dated April 21, 1948. It is called a \"Memorandum of Agreement\" and is made between the appellant, called \"the optionor\" of the first part, and the respondents, called \"the optionees\" of the second part. It recites the lease of February 6, 1948 and the assignment thereof to the appellant and continues:\nAND WHEREAS the Optionor has agreed to grant to the Optionees an option to acquire a sub-lease of the leased substances within, upon and under that part of the demised lands consisting of Legal Subdivisions Nine (9) and Ten (10) thereof upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.\nNOW THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSETH that in consideration of the premises and of the sum of One ($1.00) Dollar, now paid by the Optionees to the Optionor (receipt of which is hereby by the Optionor acknowledged) and of the covenants of the Optionees herein contained, IT IS HEREBY MUTUALLY COVENANTED AND AGREED by and between the parties hereto as follows:\n1. THE Optionor hereby grants to the Optionees an option exercisable within the time and in the manner hereinafter set forth to acquire a sub-lease of the leased substances within, upon and under the following lands, namely:\nLegal Subdivisions Nine (9) and Ten (10), of Section Thirty-one (31), in Township Forty-nine (49), Range Twenty-six (26), West of the Fourth Meridian, in the Province of Alberta, reserving unto Canadian Pacific Railway Company all coal (hereinafter called \"the sub-demised lands\"). 2. THE said option may be exercised on or before the 1st day of August, 1948, and may be exercised within the said time by the Optionees erecting upon the sub-demised lands the necessary derrick complete with rig irons, boiler and engine, and installing all drilling machinery, and actually spudding in and commencing the work of drilling a well for the discovery of petroleum on the sub-demised lands, and delivering or mailing to the Optionor notice in writing of such exercise of the said option.\n3. THE Optionees covenant to exercise the option within the said period, in the manner aforesaid, and in the event of their neglect or failure so to do, the Optionor shall, despite the lapse of the said option, be entitled to exercise any remedies which may be legally available to him for the breach by the Optionees of this covenant, which the parties hereto agree is given and entered into by the Optionees as the substantial consideration for the granting of the said option.\n4. IN the event of the exercise of the said option, the Optionor shall grant to the Optionees a sub-lease of the sub-demised lands in the form set forth in Schedule \"A\" hereto attached, and each of the parties shall forthwith after the exercise of the option execute and deliver the said sub-lease.\n5. ANY notice required to be delivered by the Optionees to the Optionor pursuant to the provisions hereof may be delivered by mailing the same in a prepaid envelope addressed to \"W. H. Cotter, Esq., c\/o Messrs. A. L. Smith, Egbert & Smith, 500 Lancaster Building, Calgary, Alberta,\" and shall be deemed to have been received by the Optionor on the day next following the date of mailing thereof.\n6. TIME shall be of the essence hereof.\nTHIS AGREEMENT shall enure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF the Optionor has hereunto his hand and seal subscribed and set and the Optionees have caused these presents to be executed and their corporate seals to be hereunto affixed witnessed by the hands of their proper officers duly authorized in that behalf, the day and year first hereinbefore written.\nIt is duly signed and sealed by all the parties. Attached as Schedule \"A\" is the form of sub-lease referred to in paragraph 4. This form is complete in the sense that it leaves no material term to be agreed upon between the parties. It is made between the Appellant as sub-lessor and the Respondents as sub-lessees. It recites the lease of February 6, 1948, referred to as the head lease (a copy whereof is attached as a schedule to the sub-lease) and the assignment thereof to the appellant and contains the following recitals:\nAND WHEREAS by Agreement in writing dated the day of April, 1948, the Sub-Lessor granted to the Sub-Lessees an option to acquire a sub-lease of the sub-demised lands hereinafter described upon the terms and conditions in the said Agreement set forth; AND WHEREAS the Sub-Lessees have exercised the said Option by, inter alia the spudding in and commencing the work of drilling a well for the discovery of petroleum upon the said sub-demised lands, and are entitled to the grant of the sub-lease aforesaid;\nThe sub-lessor grants and sub-leases to the sub-lessees all the leased substances within, upon or under the lands described in paragraph 1 of the Agreement of April 21, 1948, for the term of the head-lease and any renewals thereof. The sub-lessees assume payment of the 12\u00bd% royalty to the head-lessor and agree to pay a royalty of 2\u00bd% to the sub-lessor. There are elaborate provisions for the division of the proceeds of the sale of the products produced. Briefly summarized these provide that the net proceeds after payment of taxes, costs of production and costs of marketing shall be divided proportionately between the sub-lessor and sub-lessees until the former has received $75,000 and the latter have received the proper cost of drilling the well, and that thereafter the proceeds of net production shall be divided equally between the sub-lessor and sub-lessees. The form contains the following paragraph:\nTHE Sub-Lessees shall hereafter diligently and continuously carry on the drilling operations at the said well heretofore commenced by them until such well shall have reached a depth of Six Thousand (6,000) feet, or the limestone has been penetrated to a reasonable depth having regard to the geological situation, whichever shall first occur, unless commercial production is sooner obtained.\nIt also contains a provision similar to paragraph 14 of the lease of February 6, 1948 quoted above. It should be mentioned that the area of the lands described in the lease of February 6, 1948 is 160 acres and that of the lands described in the form of sub-lease is 80 acres.\nOn May 12, 1948 a well lying about three-quarters of a mile north east of the lands with which we are concerned was abandoned after reaching a depth of 5,424 feet and on June 3, 1948 a well lying about a mile and a quarter west by south of such lands was abandoned at a depth of 5,601 feet. These failures led the respondents to believe that it would be useless to drill on the lands described, and in the month of June, 1948 they decided that they would not commence the drilling of a well and so advised the appellant. Some correspondence ensued. The appellant through his solicitors took the position that the respondents were bound to drill a well and that he would seek damages if they failed to do so. The respondents took the position that, in view of the location of the lands in question between the two wells referred to above which had proved failures, it would be a needless waste of money to drill. The respondents persisted in their refusal and on August 31,1948 the appellant commenced this action claiming $100,000 damages.\nThe action was tried by McLaurin J. on December 3, 1948. That learned judge held 15, that the agreement of April 21, 1948, the sub-lease attached thereto and the head lease must be read together, that on their proper construction the respondents were obliged to commence drilling by August 1, 1948 and to drill a well to completion as provided in the sub-lease, that in breach of the contract they had refused to do so and were accordingly liable to pay damages. After a full and careful review of a number of decisions some in our own courts and some in the courts of the United States he concluded that the proper measure of damages was the amount which it would have cost to drill the well, which was admitted to be $53,500, plus $1,000 which the appellant had paid to Witiuk for a six months' extension of the time set for commencing to drill. In the result judgment was given for the appellant for $54,500 and costs. Three geologists gave evidence as to the chance of obtaining production by drilling on the lands in question and the learned judge finds as a fact that such chances are far from favourable but that the possibility of production cannot be completely ruled out. This finding is supported by the evidence.\nThe Court of Appeal in a unanimous judgment allowed the appeal and dismissed the action with costs16. In the judgment of the Court written by the late Chief Justice Harvey it is held that the case falls to be decided on the principle of repugnancy, which, it is stated, was not raised until the oral argument in the Court of Appeal, and that paragraph 3 of the agreement of April 21, 1948 is void for repugnancy and must be rejected as \"destructive of the object of the instrument\". The ratio of the decision of the Court of Appeal is summed up in the following paragraphs:\nThe agreement sued on herein is clearly an option agreement. It recites the agreement to grant an option and then expressly grants the option and the statement of claim alleges that an option was granted. Clearly the object of the agreement was to grant an option. What could be, in the words of Duff J. above quoted, (Git v. Forbes (1)) more \"destructive of the object of the instrument\" than a covenant completely nullifying the choice given by the instrument,\u2014a covenant that he will exercise the option,\u2014in other words, will have no choice?\nAs the Forbes case decides this covenant is \"repugnant and void\" and as the action is founded on it, the action fails.\nThe first point that arises for determination is whether or not there was a binding contract between the parties and if so the extent of the obligation imposed upon the respondents. The appellant supports the view of the learned trial judge and contends that the respondents were bound on or before August 1, 1948, to erect upon the lands in question the necessary derrick and other equipment and machinery and to actually spud in and commence to drill a well and to diligently and continuously carry on such drilling until the depth prescribed in the form of sub-lease was reached. The respondents contend, first, that the decision of the Court of Appeal is right; secondly, that, if this is not so, the only obligation which fell upon them was to commence to drill a well and that for a breach of such obligation the appellant could not recover more than nominal damages; thirdly, that if the learned trial judge was right in holding that they were bound by the contract to drill a well he assessed the damages on a wrong principle and that the damages are excessive.\nThe extent of the respondents' obligation, if any, depends upon the construction of the written contract. There appeared to be no disagreement between counsel as to the principles to be applied, but in their application to the terms of a particular document considerable difference of opinion may arise.\nIt is settled that, \"If in a deed an earlier clause is followed by a later clause which destroys altogether the obligation created by the earlier clause, the later clause is to be rejected and the earlier clause prevails.\" Forbes v. Git 17. But as was said by Duff J., as he then was, in the same case \"The rule as to repugnancy, therefore, is obviously a rule to be applied only in the last resort and when there is no reasonable way of reconciling the two passages and bringing them into harmony with some intention to be collected from the deed as a whole.\" Git v. Forbes 18.\nA rule of universal application in the construction of deeds was stated in Mill v. Hill 19, as follows: \"The general rule of construction is, that the Courts, in construing the deeds of parties, look much more to the intent to be collected from the whole deed, than from the language of any particular portion of it.\"\nIn Hillas and Co. Ltd. v. Arcos Ltd.20, Lord Tomlin, in whose judgment Lord Warrington and Lord MacMillan concurred, said: \"The problem for a court of construction must always be so to balance matters, that without violation of essential principle the dealings of men may as far as possible be treated as effective, and that the law may not incur the reproach of being the destroyer of bargains.\"\nIn my view there is no such repugnancy between the provisions of the contract here in question as requires the rejection of any of them. In paragraphs 1 and 2 the optionor grants an option and prescribes the time within which and the manner in which it may be accepted. I am unable to agree with the view of the Court of Appeal that paragraph 3 nullifies the choice given in paragraph 1, except in the sense that every right to choose by its nature ends with the making of a choice. Paragraph 3 is, I think, not the destruction of the right to choose but rather its exercise. Had paragraph 3 been omitted from the instrument altogether, it would have been open to the parties immediately after the execution of such instrument to enter into a further contract having the effect of paragraph 3 and I do not think that the whole transaction is destroyed by reason of the fact that what might have been more artistically accomplished by the use of two documents was sought to be effected in one. The method employed by the draftsman is new to me and we were not referred to any reported case in which a similar means of expression has been adopted, but in principle I can see no reason why parties may not combine in one instrument an offer open for some months and an immediate acceptance of that offer.\nI think that, read as a whole, the agreement of April 21, 1948 with its schedules discloses the intention of the parties to agree that on or before August 1, 1948 the respondents would commence to drill a well in the manner set out in paragraph 2 of the agreement, that forthwith on such commencement the parties would execute the sub-lease and that the respondents would carry on the drilling of the well to completion in the manner set out in the sublease. I think that the respondents were bound in contract not only to commence but to complete the drilling of the well within the time and in the manner prescribed, and that such obligations bound them from the moment that the agreement of April 21, 1948 was executed.\nI think that the principle applicable is accurately expressed in the following passage from Pollock on Contracts 13th Ed. (1950) at page 35. \"It has been said that 'there cannot be a contract to make a contract' but this is a misleading epigram, for it is inaccurate in so far as it goes beyond the rule that, if parties to an agreement leave essential terms in it undetermined and therefore to be settled by subsequent contract, their agreement is not an enforceable contract. On the other hand, as Lord Wright said in Hillas and Co., Ltd. v. Arcos, Ltd. (Supra) at 515, 'A contract de pr\u0153senti to enter into what, in law, is an enforceable contract is simply that enforceable contract, and no more and no less; and if what may not very accurately be called the second contract is not to take effect till some future date but is otherwise an enforceable contract, the position is as in the preceding illustration, save that the operation of the contract is postponed. But in each case there is eo instanti a complete obligation.'\"\nWhat I have said as to my view of the proper construction of the contract will indicate that I cannot accede to the respondents' argument that their only obligation was to commence to drill a well. It may be observed in passing that it would have been of no advantage to the appellant to have the respondents merely commence the drilling of a well on or before August 1, 1948. The terms of the head lease required that once having been commenced such drilling operation must be diligently carried on to the prescribed depth. Commencement of drilling coupled with failure to carry on (unless such failure were excused under paragraph 14 quoted above) would result not in any benefit to the appellant but in forfeiture of the head lease.\nThere is no suggestion that the appellant was not at all times ready and willing to perform his side of the bargain. Before the time arrived at which the first act of performance was due from the respondents they definitely repudiated the agreement and the appellant became entitled to bring this action for damages for breach of the contract.\nFor the above reasons, I respectfully agree with the learned trial judge that the respondents are liable in damages to the appellant for failure to drill a well to the prescribed depth. It is to be observed that this conclusion appears to be in harmony with the view the parties themselves entertained as disclosed in the correspondence at the time of, and following, the repudiation of the contract by the respondents. Quite apart from this correspondence and proceeding only upon a consideration of the terms of the written instrument I find myself in agreement with the view of the learned trial judge; but the view expressed in the correspondence is entitled, I think, to some weight in reaching a decision. In Foley v. Classique Coaches Ltd 21, Lord Hewart C.J. is reported to have said: \"There is no doubt that the parties intended to make a binding contract and thought that they had done so, and that is a circumstance which, according to the judgments of Lord Tomlin, Lord Thankerton and Lord Wright in Hillas & Co. v. Arcos 22, ought to be taken into consideration in deciding whether there is a concluded contract or not.\" The Court of Appeal affirmed Lord Hewart's judgment and Maugham L.J. said, at page 13: \"In the later case, Hillas and Co. v. Arcos (1), some weight, although not too much, is to be attached to the fact that the parties conceived that they were entering into a binding contract, and the old maxim applies that the document should, if possible, be so interpreted ut res magis valeat quam pereat.\"\nIt remains to be considered on what principle and at what amount the damages should be assessed.\nThe underlying principle is expressed by Lord Atkinson in Wertheim v. Chicoutimi Pulp Co.23: \"And it is the general intention of the law that, in giving damages for breach of contract, the party complaining should, so far as it can be done by money, be placed in the same position as he would have been in if the contract had been performed * * * That is a ruling principle. It is a just principle.\" In the case at bar if the respondents had carried out the contract the appellant would not have had to pay the $1,000 for a six months' extension which he did in fact pay to the head-lessor. The circumstances as to the necessity of making such payment were known to the parties and I agree with the learned trial judge that that sum is recoverable. What further benefits would have resulted to the appellant from the performance of the contract? If the respondents had drilled the well to the prescribed depth and it had proved a producer, the appellant would have received, (a) his share of the proceeds and, (b) the benefit of having the head lease validated, by the performance of the lessee's covenant to drill, not only as to the 80 acres described in the sub-lease but as to the whole 160 acres described in the head lease. If on the other hand, as, from the evidence of the geologists, would seem much more probable, the well had proved a failure the appellant would not have received benefit (a) but would have received benefit (b). It must be remembered however that as a result of the respondents' breach the appellant holds the whole 160 acres free from any claim of the respondents. No part of the consideration which under the contract would have passed to the respondents has passed, except that from April 21, 1948 until some time in June 1948, when they repudiated the agreement, the respondents had rights in the 80 acres and the appellant was not free to deal therewith. Under these circum- stances, I do not think that the cost of drilling is the proper measure of damages. Suppose that instead of the consideration set out in the contract the appellant had agreed to pay the respondents $53,500 to drill the well and the respondents had repudiated the contract before the date set for the commencement of the work and before any moneys had been paid to them. In such a case by analogy to the rule in the case of building contracts the measure of damages would seem to be the difference (if any) between the price of the work agreed upon and the cost to which the appellant was actually put in its completion. I think it will be found that those cases in which it has been held that the cost of drilling is the proper measure of damages are cases where the consideration to be given for the drilling had actually passed to the defendant. Examples of such cases are Cunningham v. Insinger 24, and Pell v. Shearman 25 (a contract to sink a shaft).\nThe appellant did not seek to put his case on the ground that by reason of the breach he stood to lose the head lease, but rather that he intended to make and was in process of making other arrangements to have a well drilled. In my view, the proper measure of his damages under the circumstances of this case is the difference between the value to him of the consideration for which the respondents agreed to drill the well and the value to him of the consideration which, acting reasonably, he should find it necessary to give to have the well drilled by others. I am unable to find in the record evidence on which the damages can be assessed on this basis. It is well settled that the mere fact that damages are difficult to estimate and cannot be assessed with certainty does not relieve the party in default of the necessity of paying damages and is no ground for awarding only nominal damages, but the onus of proving his damages still rests upon the plaintiff. The evidence of the appellant given at the trial on December 3, 1948 was to the effect that he and his associates had been and still were in negotiation with an oil company but that they had found themselves forced to deal with the whole 160 acres instead of 80 acres. As Mr. Steer pointed out there is no evidence as to the terms offered by such com- pany and such terms may have been more or less advantageous to the appellant than those contained in the contract sued on. It would have been open to the appellant to have delayed bringing his action until the completion of his arrangements to have the well drilled by which time the damages, if any, would have been more easily ascertained. But the appellant, as he had a right to do, brought his action to trial before that date. There is no complaint that any evidence he wished to tender in support of his claim for damages was rejected, nor was there any request made for a reference to fix the damages and the case must be decided upon the evidence in the record. In my view, there is no evidence to support an award of damages other than the $1,000 paid for the extension of the time for drilling. If the evidence shewed that the appellant had suffered or must of necessity suffer substantial damages, over and above the $1,000 already mentioned, by reason of the respondents' breach, the Court should, I think, seek some means of arriving at a proper assessment, but in my view the most that the evidence can be said to indicate is a probability of some loss. It is possible that there has been no loss at all.\nFor the above reasons, I would dispose of the appeal in the manner proposed by my brother Kerwin.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Nolan, Chambers, Might, Saucier, & Peacock.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Fisher, McDonald & Fisher.\n1 [1949] 2 W.W.R. 136; 1949 3 D.L.R. 634.\n2 [1949] 1 W.W.R. 193.\n3 [1922] 1 A.C. 256 at 259.\n4 [1921] 62 Can.

Manning v. Carrique, (1915) 54 O.L.R. 453.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, 1reversing the judgment of McKercher J. who dismissed the respondent's (plaintiff's) action for specific performance of an alleged contract for the sale of farm land. The facts of the case are fully stated in the reasons for judgment which follow.\nH. F. Parkinson, K.C., and W. J. Anderson for the appellants, Barrick.\nF. E. Jaenicke, K.C., for the appellant, Hohmann.\nG. H. Yule, K.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kellock J. was delivered by\nKellock J.:\u2014The first question which arises in this appeal is as to whether or not, treating the appellant Barrick's letter of the 15th of November, 1947, as an offer, the purported acceptance of the respondent was in time. The learned trial judge held that, having regard to the circumstances, it would be unreasonable for the respondent to expect that the appellant's offer was still open for acceptance on December 10th. In the view of the Court of Appeal,2 the offer was still open for acceptance on the above date. This view was based on two grounds, first that in the correspondence which preceded the offer of November 15th no haste was shown, and therefore December 10th was a reasonable time for acceptance, and second that, as a matter of law, the offer continued in effect until it was actually received by the respondent on the day upon which he purported to accept it.\nThe letter of November 15th, 1947, reads as follows:\n166 Briar Hill Ave.,\nToronto, Ont.,\nNovember 15th\/47.\nMr. F. J. Clark,\nLuseland, Sask.\nDear Sir:\nIn reply to your recent letter, in which you offer $14,500 cash for the \u00be sections W\u00bd of 9 and SW\u00bc of 16-37-24 W of 3rd. I have delayed answering in order to consult with those interested in the Estate and thereby be in a position to give something concrete.\nWe are prepared to sell this land for $15,000 cash. If this price is satisfactory to you, the deal could be closed immediately, by preparing an agreement for sale to be given you on receipt of initial payment of $2,000\u2014transfer of clear title to be given you on Jan. 1st, 1948, on receipt of balance of purchase price, $13,000. The present tenant Kostresky's lease expires March 1st, 1948.\nTrusting to hear from you as soon as possible.\nYours truly,\n(Sgd.) R. M. Barrick.\nTreating this letter as an offer, there are, I think, three indications in the letter itself which show that December 10th was beyond a reasonable time for acceptance. In the first place, the appellant states that if respondent were satisfied with the price, the transaction could be immediately closed by the preparation and delivery of an agreement of sale in exchange for $2,000 to be paid by the respondent. It is true that the word \"immediately\" does not directly relate to the acceptance of the offer, but it indicates that, as regards the closing of the transaction which would follow acceptance of the offer, there should be no delay. In the second place, the respondent is asked to give his answer \"as soon as possible.\" It is true that this phrase is not an unusual one, but it is a circumstance indicating that promptness and not dilatoriness was expected.\nThe clearest indication in the letter, however, as to the time for acceptance is the provision that after acceptance of the offer, a formal agreement of sale would be executed and exchanged for a payment of $2,000, and that the balance of the purchase price would be paid on the 1st of January, 1948, when a conveyance would be given. I think it would be absurd to say that the appellant expected that the respondent could accept the offer as late as December 10th (of which the appellant would not learn until the 13th or 15th) and that thereafter an agreement would be prepared and sent out to the respondent to be exchanged for the $2,000 payment. This would use up most of the little more than two weeks intervening between the receipt of the acceptance by the appellant and the 1st of January. In my opinion, the letter clearly indicates by its own terms that acceptance was to be made promptly if at all, and that December 10th was entirely outside the contemplation of the offerer. The only reason the offer was not in fact dealt with promptly was because the respondent was absent on a hunting expedition.\nThis view of the matter is borne out by the letter of the respondent's wife of the 20th of November, 1947, which acknowledges receipt that day of the appellant's letter. In her letter Mrs. Clark states that her husband was then out of town but was expected back in about ten days. She says that she will endeavour to locate him \"in the mean-time\" and asks that the appellant \"hold the deal open\" until he hears from the respondent. It is clear, I think, that in the view of Mrs. Clark at least, unless the deal were so held open, the offer would expire of its own force within the ten days. Her letter was adopted by the respondent in his later correspondence.\nThe appellant in his letter of the 12th of December, 1947, states that he \"held the deal open for you until December 6th when I received an offer from William Hohmann.\" This is in error for December 3rd, as Hohmann's offer was received and accepted by the appellant on that date. In his oral evidence Barrick said he had held the deal open from day to day, but I see no reason why he could not equally, from day to day, take the position that he would not continue to do so.\nI see nothing in the earlier correspondence which is inconsistent with the view just expressed. The appellant was obtaining information as to the proper value of the farm in question, and he also had to consult his beneficiaries before he was in a position either to make or accept an offer. He was pursuing both lines of enquiry between September 8, 1947, and November 15, when he made the offer in question. In my opinion, the learned trial judge came to the correct conclusion.\nNor can I agree with the proposition laid down in the Court of Appeal that the offer must be considered as a matter of law as remaining open until the respondent actually received it on his return from his hunting trip. The authorities relied on do not establish such a proposition.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge. The appellants should have their costs in this court and in the Court of Appeal.\nTASCHEREAU J.:\u2014The plaintiff-respondent's claim is for specific performance. The action was dismissed by Mr. Justice McKercher, but the Court of Appeal for the Province of Saskatchewan, unanimously allowed the appeal, and ordered the appellants to execute and deliver to the respondent, a transfer of the land which is the subject of the present litigation.\nOn the 15th of November, 1947, the appellant, R. N. Barrick, acting also on behalf of Theresa May Florella Barrick, his co-executor of the estate of James Barrick, addressed the following letter to F. J. Clark of Luseland, Sask.:\n166 Briar Hill Ave.,\nToronto, Ont.\nNov. 15, 1947.\nMr. F. J. Clark,\nLuseland, Sask.\nDear Sir:\nIn reply to your recent letter, in which you offer $14,500 cash for the \u00be sections W\u00bd of 9 and SW\u00bc of 16-37-24 W of 3rd. I have delayed answering in order to consult with those interested in the Estate and thereby be in a position to give something concrete. We are prepared to sell this land for $15,000 cash. If this price is satisfactory to you, the deal could be closed immediately, by preparing an agreement for sale to be given you on receipt of initial payment of $2,000\u2014transfer of clear title to be given you on Jan. 1st, 1948, on receipt of balance of purchase price $13,000. The present tenant Kostrosky's lease expires March 1st, 1948.\nTrusting to hear from you as soon as possible.\nYours truly,\n(Sgd.) R. N. Barrick\nThe letter which was sent from Toronto, Ont. reached Luseland a few days later, at a time when Clark was away on a hunting trip, but the letter having been opened by Mrs. Clark, Barrick received the following answer dated November 20th:\u2014\nLake & Clark\nLuseland, Sask.\nNovember 20, 1947.\nR. N. Barrick, Esq.,\nTORONTO, Ont.\nDear Sir: Re W\u00bd 9 and S.W. 16-37-24 W 3rd\nYour letter of the 15th was delivered today and in reply would say that Mr. Clark is out of town at present but expects to be home in about ten days; in the meantime I shall endeavour to locate him and request that you hold the deal open until you hear from him.\nYours respectfully,\n(Mrs. F. J. Clark) (Sgd.) M. M. Clark\nUpon his return to Luseland on December the 10th, Clark accepted to pay the sum of $15,000 for the land, forwarded a cheque for $2,000, and he agreed to pay the balance of the purchase price, namely, $13,000 on or before January 1, 1948, upon production of a clear title and a properly completed transfer.\nThe appellant then informed Clark that upon receipt of Mrs. Clark's letter, he understood that Clark would be away for about ten days, and he therefore kept the offer open until December the 6th, (should be 3rd) date on which he sold the land to a Mr. Hohmann from whom he had received an offer of $15,000, and returned the cheque for $2,000. I do not think that the other correspondence exchanged between the parties previously to the letters above referred to, have any bearing on the case.\nI have reached the conclusion that the appellants are not bound to give effect to Clark's acceptance of their offer, and that they were within their right to sell the land to Hohmann. The offer to sell at $15,000 contained in the letter of November the 15th, was subject to a prompt acceptance by Clark. The words in the offer \"the deal could be closed immediately\" and \"trusting to hear from you as soon as possible\", clearly imply Barrick's desire to receive an answer without delay. More than a reasonable time had elapsed when the appellants sold to Hohmann. Moreover, Mrs. Clark's letter written on November the 20th, saying that she expected her husband \"in about ten days\", justified Barrick to dispose of the land on the 3rd of December as he did.\nIn view of my conclusion, I think that the caveat which has been registered by the respondent should be vacated.\nI would allow the appeal, and restore the judgment at trial with costs throughout.\nEstey J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal in Saskatchewan reversing a judgment at trial and directing specific performance of an agreement for sale against the appellant estate, as vendors, in favour of respondent Clark, as purchaser, and further directing that the appellant Hohmann may assess damages against the appellant estate for breach of contract to sell to him the same land.\nThe appellant executors of the estate of Eli James Barrick, deceased, at all times material hereto have been the registered owners of the three quarter sections here in question described as W\u00bd of 9 and SW\u00bc of 16, both in Township 37, Range 24, West of the Third Meridian. The executors of this estate reside in Toronto and throughout the negotiations for sale on their behalf have been conducted by R. N. Barrick of Toronto.\nOn September 8, 1947, respondent Clark, who resides at Luseland, Saskatchewan, by letter addressed to R. N. Barrick, Toronto, inquired if the estate would be interested in a sale of these three quarter sections. Barrick, under date of October 10, 1947, acknowledged Clark's letter, apologized for his delay in answering and, in turn, inquired what this land would be worth. Clark, in his reply of October 16, 1947, did not answer Barrick's inquiry. He made it clear that cash was available if the price was reasonable and asked \"what the price would be.\" On October 24, 1947, Barrick replied that he would recommend for acceptance any satisfactory cash offer and that Kostrosky, a very satisfactory tenant over a period of years, was anxious to buy this land upon terms. He then intimated that he was endeavouring to ascertain \"what a fair cash price would be,\" but, if, in the meantime, Clark would care to make an offer he would see that it \"got immediate attention.\" Clark, on October 30, 1947, offered $14,500, possession any time between January 1 and March 1, 1948. In making this offer Clark requested that if Barrick decided to recommend it he wire to that effect and estimate how long would be required to obtain a final decision. Barrick did not decide to recommend this offer but, under date of November 15, 1947, made a counter offer which read:\nWe are prepared to sell this land for $15,000 cash. If this price is satisfactory to you, the deal could be closed immediately, by preparing an agreement for sale to be given you on receipt of initial payment of $2,000\u2014transfer of clear title to be given you on Jan. 1st, 1948, on receipt of balance of purchase price $13,000. The present tenant Kostrosky's lease expires March 1st, 1948.\nThis letter was delivered in Luseland November 20, when Clark was absent. Mrs. Clark opened the letter and wrote Barrick that her husband was out of town, but expected back in about ten days, that she would \"endeavour to locate him,\" and requested \"that you hold the deal open until you hear from him.\" Barrick made no reply to this letter from Mrs. Clark.\nClark returned on December 10, when he wrote in part:\nOwing to various circumstances I am not going to ask the Estate to split the difference between my offer and their figure though I think $14,750 would be a fair compromise. I am enclosing a cheque for $2,000 drawn on my account at the National Trust Co. Edmonton. The transfer and necessary papers I wish made out in the name of Frank J. Clark. I agree to pay the balance of the purchase price on or before Jan. 1st upon production by the Estate of evidence of a clear title and a properly completed transfer. It may be inconvenient for you to secure a Sask. transfer form and if so I would be glad to prepare the necessary transfer on the proper Sask form upon receipt of your request.\nI presume you have a written lease with Kostrosky and note it expires on Mar. 1st next. Is there the customary cancellation clause providing for notice of cancellation after Dec. 1st? If there is I would expect the Estate to serve the necessary notice of cancellation on Kostrosky. If there is no such cancellation clause I am prepared to assume the lease upon or under assignment from the Estate.\nKindly acknowledge receipt of this letter by return mail. In the meantime the appellant William Hohmann, also of Luseland, but without knowledge of Clark's correspondence, under date of November 28, inquired of Barrick with regard to this land and Barrick, on November 30, offered him the land for $15,000 cash. Hohmann accepted this offer on December 3 and both Hohmann and Barrick desire that this contract be carried out.\nThe day after writing his letter of December 10 respondent Clark heard of Hohmann's purchase and on that date wired Barrick as follows:\nRETURNED HERE YESTERDAY MORNING FROM BIG GAME HUNTING TRIP AIRMAILED LETTER TO YOU LAST NIGHT ENCLOSING TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS MORNING TOWN GOSSIP CLAIMS WILLIAM HOHMAN HAS BOUGHT THE THREE QUARTERS PRESUME YOU RECEIVED MRS OLARKS LETTER NOVEMBER TWENTIETH TRUST THAT REPORT IS NOT CORRECT WOULD APPRECIATE REPLY BY WIRE\nBarrick received this wire on December 12 and on that date wrote Clark as follows:\nI received your wire today. I received Mrs. Clark letter of Nov. 20th in reply to mine of Nov. 15. Mrs. Clark informed me that as you would be away for ten days and requested me to hold the deal open until your return. I held the deal open for you until Dec. 6th when I received an offer from Wm. Hohmann of $15,000 all cash which I accepted having had no reply from you. My solicitor is preparing Transfer of title to Mr. Hohmann and if he comes across with $15,000 he will be given same. If he fails to do so, I shall be at liberty to sell to some one else.\nI am very sorry this hitch has occurred and I shall return your $2,000 immediately on receipt of same.\nUpon the assumption that Clark's letter of December 10 otherwise constituted an acceptance of Barrick's counter offer of November 15, the question arises: was it within a reasonable time? The parties had throughout conducted their negotiations by letters and, as Barrick's counter offer did not specify a time for an acceptance other than a suggestion of a reply as soon as possible, Clark had a reasonable time within which to make his acceptance by the posting of a letter to that effect. Adams v. Lindsell 3; Household Fire Insurance Company v. Grant 4. What will constitute a reasonable time depends upon the nature and character of the subject matter and the normal or usual course of business in negotiations leading to a sale thereof, as well as the circumstances of the offer including the conduct of the parties in the course of negotiations. Dunlop v. Higgins 5; Manning v. Carrique 6 and 7 Hals. 2nd ed., p. 93, par. 129.\nFarm lands, apart from evidence to the contrary (not here adduced), are not subject to frequent or sudden changes or fluctuations in price and, therefore, in the ordinary course of business a reasonable time for the acceptance of an offer would be longer than that with respect to such commodities as shares of stock upon an established trading market. It would also be longer than in respect to goods of a perishable character. With this in mind the fact, therefore, that it was land would tend to lengthen what would be concluded as a reasonable time, which, however, must be determined in relation to the other circumstances.\nWhile the correspondence between Clark and Barrick commenced with the letter of September 8, much of the time was spent by Barrick in ascertaining the current selling value of the land. Even in his letter which induced Clark to make his offer of October 30, Barrick indicated that he had not satisfied himself as to that current selling value. Clark himself, in his offer of October 30, asked \"for the estate's decision as fast as possible\" and, if Barrick had decided to recommend his offer, to wire accordingly. Barrick, apparently appreciating Clark's desire to conclude this matter, as he explained in his counter offer, consulted with those interested in the estate and made a concrete reply in the nature of a counter offer. Clark had obviously made up his mind at least on October 30 as to the current selling value of the land. This is not only evidenced by his offer of that date, but when he returned upon December 10 he immediately accepted the counter offer.\nUnder the circumstances of this case, the offer must be taken to have been received by Clark on November 20. It was addressed to him and received at his usual address and opened by his wife who, though she did not care to take the responsibility to deal with the counter offer, had been appraised of these negotiations and, upon his own evidence, she had at least authority to receive the offer, if not to deal therewith. Clark was asked in reply:\nQ. When you went away on this hunting trip, expecting this reply from Mr. Barrick any moment, and you not knowing how long you were going to be away exactly, why didn't you speak to Mr. McKenzie, and give him instructions as to what he should do in the event of your offer being accepted or rejected, or a counter-offer being received? A. It was not necessary. I had done that with my wife.\nThe offer of Barrick remained open for acceptance and in that sense as being renewed every moment until a reasonable time elapsed. While this time may be expressly enlarged by an act on the part of the offeror, a letter to him asking that the offer be kept open does not enlarge this reasonable time if the offeror elects, as he did, to not make reply. In that event the rights of the parties remain unchanged.\nThe offeree has the right, within a reasonable time, to accept and it is only by such an acceptance that he is given any rights against the offeror. What Barrick did or intended to do does not alter that time. If, when he accepted Hohmann's offer, a reasonable time had not elapsed, it would only be in the event that Clark's acceptance was within a reasonable time that the latter would have any right to take exception thereto.\nIt was particularly pointed out that there had been no sale for this land over a period of years. Possession could not be had until March 1 and, in any event, no farming operations could take place until spring conditions permitted. These are factors to be considered. However, there was, at the time material to these negotiations, a demand for this land. The owner, desiring to sell, would wish to avail himself of these conditions and those negotiating, other than the successful purchaser, would, no doubt, desire to consider other land or other possible courses that might be open to them. Clark, by his offer of October 30, because of his insistence upon reply by wire, must have had these latter considerations in mind rather than the date of possession or spring operations on the farm. Barrick, while he did not perhaps evidence as much concern as to the date of concluding the transaction, did, in his offer of November 15, in appreciation of Clark's desire, intimate that \"the deal could be closed immediately\" and concluded with what might be accepted as the expression of a hope that Clark would reply \"as soon as possible.\" A review of all the authorities submitted as well as others reviewed leads me to conclude, with great respect to those learned Judges who hold a contrary opinion, that Clark did not accept Barrick's offer within a reasonable time.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nLocke J.:\u2014The letters which passed between the appellant R. N. Barrick and the respondent appear in the reasons for the judgment from which this appeal is taken and it is unnecessary to repeat them. It was the opinion of the learned trial judge that the offer made by the said Barrick on behalf of the executors of the estate of Eli James Barrick by the letter of November 15, 1947, had lapsed prior to December 10th of that year, when the respondent assumed to accept it. This finding has been reversed by the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nThe offer did not state a time within which it might be accepted and the matter to be determined is as to whether the respondent accepted it within a reasonable time, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offer. After the preliminary letters of September 8th and October 10th and 16th the appellant R. N. Barrick by his letter of October 24th advised the respondent that he was prepared to recommend the executors of the estate to accept any satisfactory offer to buy the land for cash, saying that the tenant of the property was anxious to buy but only upon terms, and concluded: \"If in the meantime you would care to make an offer I would see that it got immediate attention.\" To this the respondent replied in writing on October 30th by making a cash offer of $14,500, asking for the estate's decision \"as fast as possible\" and that Barrick wire him if he decided to recommend acceptance of the offer by the estate. It was in answer to this letter that R. N. Barrick made the offer of November 15th saying that if the price of $15,000 was satisfactory the deal could be closed immediately and concluded by saying: \"Trusting to hear from you as soon as possible.\" In my view, this correspondence indicates, as found by the learned trial judge, that it was proposed and that both parties intended that the matter should be dealt with promptly. It was on November 20th that Mrs. Clark in her husband's absence wrote the letter saying that the latter was out of town but expected to be home in about ten days and asked that the deal be held open until Barrick should hear from him. Apparently this letter was received in Toronto on November 23rd and it was not until seventeen days afterwards that Clark mailed from Luseland the letter which was intended as an acceptance of the offer.\nIn reversing the judgment at the trial MacDonald J.A., who delivered the judgment of the Court, finding that the offer had been accepted within a reasonable time lays stress on the evidence given by the respondent R. N. Barrick at the trial, that upon receipt of Mrs. Clark's letter he had let the matter go from day to day and that he \"was not in such a hurry as he admitted (sic) in his previous correspondence\", that he had sold to Hohman instead of Clark because the former was the first man who \"accepted my proposition\" and that he had decided to leave the offer open from day to day. With great respect, I think this evidence does not affect the question to be determined. An intention not expressed or communicated to the other party is immaterial in deciding the question as to whether there was an agreement. The law appears to me to be accurately summarized in Leake (8th Ed.) p. 2, where it is said that the law judges the intention of a person by outward expressions only and judges of an agreement between two persons exclusively from those expressions of their intention which are communicated between them unless there is a duty to speak, in which event a party may become bound by his silence. Unless the appellant's position is altered by the fact that R. N. Barrick made no response to the letter of November 20th received from Mrs. Clark, the question should, in my opinion, be determined by considering only the communications which passed between the parties. It is fairly arguable on behalf of the respondent that by his silence Barrick should be held to have consented to the offer being treated as being made at the expiration of a ten day period from November 20th, but I think this contention cannot be sustained. There was, I think, no duty resting upon Barrick to say or do anything upon receipt of the letter and the appellant's right to insist that the acceptance was not made within a reasonable time after the offer was received at Luseland on November 20th is not impaired. The passage referred to from the judgment of Lord Cottenham L.C. in Dunlop v. Higgins 7, is a quotation from the judgment of the Court in Adams v. Lindsell 8, and appears to have been made merely in reference to the facts of that case and not as a general statement of the law. It cannot have been intended to qualify what had been said by Lord Eldon L.C. in Kennedy v. Lee 9, that the acceptance of an offer unlimited by its terms as to time must be within a reasonable time after the offer is made.\nI think the proper construction has been placed upon this correspondence by the learned trial judge and I agree with his conclusion and would allow this appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed and the judgment at trial restored.

He had pleaded self-defence, provocation and drunkenness. His appeal was unanimously dismissed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.\nHeld: That, when dealing with the specific pleas of self-defence and provocation, there was a grave departure by the trial judge from the general principles he had laid down in the opening part of his charge with respect to the burden of proof\u2014using the word \u201cestablish\u201d in such a way that the jury could reasonably understand it to mean \u201cif it was established by the accused\u201d\u2014and that it was never stated to the jury, either expressly or by clear implication, that, if they were in doubt as to whether the act was provoked, it was their duty to reduce the offence from murder to manslaughter.\nHeld: A direction to the jury (which could reasonably be, by them, related to the accused) that, if on one point they found the evidence of a witness to be deliberately untrue, they could not believe him in any other particular, was a misdirection of a most serious nature and tantamount to an encroachment upon the right of full answer and defence.\nHeld: The validity of the defence of drunkenness is dependent upon the proof that the accused was at the time of the commission affected by drunkenness to the point of being unable to form not any intent but the specific intent to commit the crime charged.\nHeld: As it is the duty of a juror to disagree if unable conscientiously to accept the views of his colleagues, it is wrong in law to tell the jury that they \u201cmust agree upon a verdict\u201d.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing appellant\u2019s appeal from his conviction by a judge and jury on a charge of murder.\nC.L. Dubin, M.N. Lacourci\u00e8re and R.H. Frith for the appellant.\nW.B. Common K.C. and H.D. Wilkins K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014The appellant has been convicted, in the city of Sudbury, in the province of Ontario, of the murder of the wife of his first cousin, one C\u00e9cile Rainville. His appeal against such conviction was unanimously dismissed by the Court of Appeal, the reasons for judgment reading:\nAfter listening to the able and elaborate argument addressed to us, we are quite unable to find anything in what has been adduced, which would warrant our interfering with the verdict of the jury. There is nothing to be gained by going over, one by one, the items so ably put before us but the facts in this case are overwhelming and, in view of the findings of the jury and the interpretation they put upon them, there is nothing to be said. The appeal will be dismissed.\nPursuant to section 1025(1), 1948 ch. 39 s. 42 of the Criminal Code, leave to appeal was granted on the following points of law: (a) Misdirection of the trial judge as to the onus probandi. (b) Lack of adequate direction with respect to the benefit of reasonable doubt on every issue raised in the defence (Latour v. The King)[1] (c) Misdirection in the following instructions to the jury:\u2014\nShould you come to the conclusion that any witness came here and told something that he knew was not true, that would be tantamount to perjury, and anybody who gives evidence that was not true in any one instance, could not be believed in any other particular.\nand (d) Failure of the trial judge to relate to the specific crime charged, the rule as to intent applicable in the defence of drunkenness.\nAt the close of the argument, the Court indicating that reasons for judgment would be delivered later, allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and ordered a new trial. In view of this order, only such circumstances as are necessary for the determination of the questions raised will be referred to.\nOn the morning of September 12, 1949, the appellant, both hands badly bleeding, was seen by the landlady and another tenant of the building, leaving the apartment occupied by his cousin Peter Rainville, the deceased C\u00e9cile Rainville, and her brother Alexander Verdon. After a short visit to the home of some friends, to wash his hands, he immediately proceeded to the police department where he reported that he had been in a fight and, from there, was escorted to the hospital where he received surgical attendance on his injuries on both hands. Meanwhile, the police, alerted by the landlady of the apartment, proceeded thereto and found the body of the deceased, bearing some thirty-two wounds; they also found a knife admittedly identified as belonging to the appellant and a coat the latter had borrowed from Verdon. As to what took place in the apartment, there is no evidence but the incomplete account\u2014hereinafter referred to\u2014given by the appellant himself; the evidence of the landlady and of the other witness on the point throws little or no light. The theory submitted to the jury by the Crown was that the appellant, well aware of the absence of both his cousin and the brother of the victim, Verdon, visited the apartment that morning for the purpose of having carnal knowledge with the victim and that, when she refused, he stabbed her with his knife. It was conceded that there is no evidence in point of an assault prompted by such motives nor of any prior guilty passion by the accused towards the deceased. The evidence reveals that the appellant, a bushman, was, on the day of the fatal occurrence, terminating, in the city of Sudbury, a two-weeks vacation during which, being on good terms with the Rainvilles, he freely visited their home. The appellant testified that the return of the coat of Verdon was the purpose of his visit to the apartment on the morning of the 12th. He relates the following facts: Having delivered the coat, he was departing from the apartment when the deceased invited him to stay, sit and talk and, eventually, proposed to have sexual relations with him. He says that he then scolded her and told her he knew much of how she was carrying on. It may be pointed out here that independent evidence shows that the day before, the appellant having, in the presence of Peter Rainville and Verdon, made unfavourable remarks as to the moral conduct of the deceased, Verdon became angry and left the company in protest. There is no evidence, however, that these remarks of the appellant were subsequently conveyed to the victim either by her husband or by Verdon. The appellant testified that the victim became incensed and told him he knew too much of her past and that she then drew a knife from behind her back and went to stab him. He protected himself with his hands but being then stabbed and by reason of the combined effect of the stabbing, of pain in his hands and of two weeks of persistent drinking, he said he lost his head and does not recall what happened from that moment, up to time he was washing his hands at the home of their common friends. He further denied having brought the knife with him suggesting the deceased must have taken it from his room, which she visited with him two days before, for the purpose of looking over some old family pictures. The occurrence of this visit is corroborated by an independent witness. On the basis of these facts, pleas of self\u2011defence, provocation and drunkenness were advanced on behalf of the appellant, and with respect to each of these pleas, the jurors received from the trial judge instructions which must now be considered conjunctively with the above grounds of appeal.\nDealing with grounds (a) and (b). The principles of the criminal law as to the onus probandi and the benefit. of the doubt being substantially correlated in their application, the merits of the first two grounds of appeal may, in this case, conveniently be dealt with together.\nIn the early part of his charge the trial judge, before entering upon the discussion of the facts of the case and before any reference whatever to the pleas of self-defence, provocation and drunkenness, and to the different verdicts resulting respectively therefrom, properly charged the jury as to the burden of the proof and the benefit of the doubt, making his own the following words of Viscount Sankey, Lord Chancellor, in Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions[2], particularly at page 94:\u2014\n\u2026it is not until the end of the evidence that a verdict can properly be found and that at the end of the evidence, it is not for the prisoner to establish his innocence but for the prosecution to establish his guilt. Just as there is evidence on behalf of the prosecution, so there may be evidence on behalf of the prisoner which may cause a doubt as to his guilt. In either case, he is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It must be kept in mind that while the prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner, there is no such burden laid upon the prisoner, to prove his innocence and it is sufficient for him to raise a doubt as to his guilt. He is not called upon to satisfy the jury of his innocence.\nAnd he further instructed the jury with respect to circumstantial evidence, giving them the rule formulated by Baron Alderson in the Hodge[3] case. No complaint is made as to the way in which these matters were explained as general principles in criminal law. It is complained, however, that, when he later dealt with the pleas of self-defence and of provocation, there was a grave departure by the learned trial judge from the general principles he had laid down with respect to the doubt, he entirely failed throughout the charge to direct the attention of the jurors, in their consideration of the plea of provocation, to their duty, to give the appellant the benefit of the doubt, if any, in favour of the lesser charge of manslaughter. The following excerpts from the charge, fairly representing the substance of the directions with which the jury was left in the matter, are impeached by the appellant as casting the burden of proof upon him and, therefore, as being in violation of the principles laid down particularly in the Woolmington case. As to the plea of self-defence, the trial judge said, at page 407 of the record:\nIt is for the jury to say whether or not the necessary facts have been established to warrant a plea of self-defence.\nand as to the plea of provocation, he said, at page 413:\nThe doctrine is that an unlawful killing resulting from a deliberate act of violence is prima facie murder but that, if it is established that the accused acted under a certain set of conditions which were such as to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control, that presumption is rebutted and the killing is only manslaughter.\nOn behalf of the respondent, it was pointed out that the trial judge did not say \u201cestablished by the accused\u201d but simply \u201cestablished\u201d and then argued that no burden was consequently cast upon the appellant to prove the ingredients necessary to a plea of self-defence or to a plea of provocation as had been explained to the jury. In the circumstances of this case, the jury, in my view, could only, or to say the least, could reasonably understand the directions as if it had, in effect, been said: \u201cif it was established by the accused\u201d for, in this case, it is virtually only from the account given by the appellant of what took place in the apartment between himself and the victim, that the proof of the ingredients necessary to each defence could, if at all, be found. It is on that view that the legality of the instructions must be considered for, in Bigaouette v. The King[4], Duff J., as he then was, delivering the judgment for the Court, stated at page 114:\nThe law, in our opinion, is correctly stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Stuart in Rex v. Gallagher, in these words:\n\u2026it is not what the judge intended but what his words as uttered would convey to the minds of the jury which is the decisive matter. Even if the matter were evenly balanced, which I think it is not, and the language used were merely just as capable of the one meaning as the other, the position would be that the jury would be as likely to take the words in the sense in which it was forbidden to use them as in the innocuous sense and in such circumstances I think the error would be fatal.\nIt is suggested, on behalf of the appellant, that according to the dictionary, the word \u201cestablish\u201d means \u201cplace beyond dispute.\u201d (Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd edition, page 684). On that basis, it would then appear sufficient to substitute these words to the word \u201cestablish\u201d to conclude that, had it been said:\nIt is for the jury to say whether or not the necessary facts have been placed beyond dispute by the accused to warrant a plea of self-defence.\nor had it been said with respect to the plea of provocation:\n\u2026if it is placed beyond dispute by the accused that he acted under a certain set of conditions\u2026\nthe two directions, standing alone, would have been palpably wrong, for the law only requires that the evidence in the record,\u2014introduced by the Crown or the defence, it does not matter\u2014be sufficient to raise in the minds of the jury a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused acted in self-defence or under provocation.\nIn judicial proceedings, the word \u201cestablish\u201d is correlated to the burden of the proof but to the burden of the proof not in the sense of the necessity there may be for an accused in the course of the enqu\u00eate to introduce evidence in order to explain away the case being made by the Crown, but in the sense of the permanent and paramount obligation there is for the Crown, at the end and on the whole of the case, to have proved the guilt beyond all reasonable doubt.\nIn Phipson on Evidence, 8th edition, it is stated at page 27:\nAs applied to judicial proceedings, the phrase \u201cburden of proof\u201d has two distinct and frequently confused meanings: (1) The burden of proof as a matter of law and pleading\u2014the burden, as it has been called, of establishing a case, whether by preponderance of evidence, or beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) The burden of proof in the sense of introducing evidence\u2026 So in criminal cases, even where the second, or the minor burden of introducing evidence is cast upon or shifted to the accused, yet the major one of satisfying the jury of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is always upon the prosecution and never changes; and if, on the whole case, they have such a doubt, the accused is entitled to the benefit of it and must be acquitted.\n(Mancini v. D.P.P.[5]; Woolmington v. D.P.P.[6])\nIt is clearly in relation to the \u201cmajor burden,\u201d it may be pointed out, that the word \u201cestablish\u201d is used by the House of Lords in the above excerpt from the Woolmington case. In giving directions to the jury, the use of the word \u201cestablish\u201d in relation to the \u201cminor burden\u201d of introducing evidence, is inadequate, confusing and potentially dangerous as it may, depending upon the context or upon the whole charge and the nature and circumstances of the case, lead the jury into error as to the plain nature of their duty with respect to the most important feature of our criminal law, the paramount and permanent burden of the Crown to establish ultimately its case beyond all reasonable doubt. Not that it is suggested that the word \u201cestablish\u201d is necessarily improper in all cases. Used with proper qualifications, it has been approved\u2014it was pointed out on behalf of the respondent\u2014in cases where a defence of insanity is raised. This, however, affords no argument in favour of the latter\u2019s views, for a defence of insanity is a matter altogether different. In point of fact, the legislature affirms a legal but rebuttable presumption against insanity. Section 18 of the Criminal Code reads:\nEveryone shall be presumed to be sane at the time of doing or omitting to do any act until the contrary is proved.\nSo, there is, in such case, an obligation to prove or to establish the defence of insanity even if it needs not be established beyond reasonable doubt but only to the reasonable satisfaction of the jury. Smythe v. The King[7] No similar presumption exists, however, with respect to the issue of self-defence or of provocation. Even the presumption that everyone intends the natural consequences of his act needs, in order to be rebutted, no more than evidence sufficient to raise a doubt as to the intent. Nor is it suggested that the use of the word \u201cestablish\u201d will always be fatal in all of the cases, for each case must be judged upon its merits but confusion in words naturally, if not always, leads to confusion in ideas and, in the matter, to confusion as to what the duty is. Again and in the case at bar, all what was said as to the burden of proof and the benefit of reasonable doubt, has been indicated above and was further stated as general principles in the earlier part of a charge, necessarily lengthy, and long before any reference was made to the special issues raised in the case, to the necessary ingredients thereof and to the different verdicts resulting therefrom. But the principle that, if the jurors were in doubt as to whether the act was provoked, it was their duty to reduce the offence from murder to manslaughter, was never stated to them, either expressly or by clear implication. In the case of Prince[8], the accused, charged with murder, pleaded provocation. This was the only issue. A verdict of murder was set aside for the following reasons stated by the Lord Chancellor at page 64:\nWe think that the summing up was insufficient. Having regard to the absence of any direction that, if upon the review of all the evidence, the jury were left in reasonable doubt whether, even if the appellant\u2019s explanation were not accepted, the act was provoked, the appellant was entitled to be acquitted of the charge of murder.\nIn the case of Manchuk v. The King[9], the jury, while considering the case, returned to Court to request the assistance of the learned trial judge upon a difficulty which they explained in the following question:\nIn order to reduce a murder charge to a manslaughter charge, is it necessary to establish the fact that the person killed committed the act of provocation?\nAt page 349, Sir Lyman Duff, the then Chief Justice of Canada, said:\nThe terms in which the question is expressed manifest plainly that (notwithstanding some observations in the earlier part of the charge as to the burden resting upon the Crown up to the end of the case of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt) they had fallen into the very natural error of thinking that, in proving the killing, the Crown had disposed of the presumption of the prisoner\u2019s innocence and that they must find the prisoner guilty of murder unless he affirmatively established to their satisfaction provocation in the pertinent sense. The interrogatory of the jury ought to have been answered in such a manner as to remove this error from their minds. It ought to have been made clear to them that in the last resort the prisoner could not properly be convicted of murder if, as the result of the evidence as a whole, they were in reasonable doubt whether or not he was guilty of that crime.\nOn behalf of the respondent, it was suggested that the general instructions given at the beginning of the charge of the trial judge as to the burden of proof and the doubt, were sufficient and that, as stated at page 280 in the Mancini case (supra):\nThere is no reason to repeat to the jury the warning as to the reasonable doubt again and again, provided that the direction is plainly given.\nIt is not difficult to agree with this sentence from the Mancini case but it is impossible to accept that in the charge made in the present case, the pertinent direction was \u201cplainly given.\u201d\nIn Albert Edward Lewis[10], Avory J., as he then was, stated, at page 34:\nThe importance of telling the jury that the burden has not shifted is probably greater in a case in which the defendant goes into the witness-box (as the appellant did) than in one in which he does not. The jury not unnaturally are apt to think that when a defendant goes into the witness-box the burden is on him to satisfy them of his innocence.\nWhile one may regard the direction given with respect to the plea of self-defence as being less questionable because of the general instructions given in the earlier part of the charge, the impeached direction with respect to the plea of provocation, coupled with the complete lack of direction as to the duty of the jury to give the benefit of the doubt, if any, on the issue raised and bring a verdict of manslaughter instead of a verdict of murder, leaves no doubt, I must say with deference, that the jury was not instructed according to law. For, once properly instructed as to what the law recognizes as ingredients of self-defence or of provocation, the accurate question for the jury is not whether the accused has established such ingredients but whether the evidence indicates them. And they, then, must be directed that, should they find affirmatively or be left in doubt on the question put to them, the accused is entitled, in the case of self-defence to a complete acquittal, or in the case of provocation to an acquittal of the major offence of murder. To dispose of the third ground of appeal, it could be sufficient to say that, with natural fairness, it was conceded by Mr. Common, K.C., of counsel for respondent, that it was a misdirection to instruct the jury in the following terms:\nShould you come to the conclusion that any witness came here and told something that he knew was not true, that would be tantamount to perjury and anybody who gives evidence that was not true in any one instance, could not be believed in any other particular.\nAnd it could be added that this Court, in Deacon v. The King[11], approved, at page 536, what had been said by Riddell J. in Rex v. Kadeshewitz[12], when the latter refused to accept, as being the law in Canada, the following summarized statement, the substance of which is attributed to Lord C.J. Hewart in the case of Harris[13]:\nIf a witness is proved to have made a statement, though unsworn, in distinct conflict with his evidence on oath, the proper direction to the jury is that his testimony is negligible and that their verdict should be found on the rest of the evidence.\nBut to examine in a proper light the ultimate suggestion made on behalf of the respondent that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice resulted from such misdirection, it is further convenient to consider two questions: To which of the witnesses heard in this case such warning could reasonably be related by the jury, and, then, what effect, if any, it could have in the result.\nThe facts, proof of which was material to the case of the Crown\u2014the death of C\u00e9cile Rainville, the violent cause of her death, and the author of her death,\u2014were not virtually disputed by the appellant who, by his very testimony, assumed the task of explaining them away in relating what, according to him, took place between him and the victim in the apartment, for the advancement of his pleas of self-defence and of provocation. At the end of the case, the veracity and the credibility of the accused really turned to be the crucial point for the decision of the case. Naturally, any direction in this respect would particularly and at first be applied to the accused by the jury. Furthermore, the manner and the measure in which the appellant was cross-examined by the Crown Attorney and the trial judge as well, could only add to the natural disposition of the jury to relate the misdirection to him. Throughout the address to the jury, the instructions with respect to the special pleas advanced, were either prefaced or followed by the caveat: \u201cIf you accept the testimony of the accused.\u201d To be virtually directed that, if on one point, they found his evidence deliberately untrue, they could not believe him in any other particular, was a misdirection of a most serious nature as, if the condition on which rested the direction was found to exist, the jury was then instructed to entirely disregard the whole defence. To say that, in the circumstances of this case, this misdirection could be tantamount to an encroachment upon the right of full answer and defence, would not be an extravagant statement.\nDealing now with the last ground of appeal. It was formulated orally in the course of the argument, leave to do so being then granted upon the consent of the Crown, and in view of the importance of the case. The grievance is that the trial judge failed to direct the jury that the validity of the defence of drunkenness is dependent upon the proof that the accused was, at the time of the commission, affected by drunkenness to the point of being unable to form not any intent but the specific intent to commit the crime charged in this case, the crime of murder, or the lesser crime of manslaughter. As it turned out, this ground was not pressed in the argument and, for this reason, its merits will not be discussed. As there will be a new trial, it may be pertinent to say a word on this and another matter. The rules of law for determining the validity of the defence of drunkenness have been stated, in the two following propositions, by Lord Birkenhead, in the Beard case[14]:\nThat evidence of drunkenness which renders the accused incapable of forming the specific intent essential to constitute the crime should be taken into consideration with the other facts proved in order to determine whether or not he had this intent.\nThat evidence of drunkenness falling short of a proved incapacity in the accused to form the intent necessary to constitute the crime, and merely establishing that his mind was affected by drink so that he more readily gave way to some violent passion, does not rebut the presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of his acts.\nReference may equally be had to the judgment of this Court in MacAskill v. The King[15] The other matter in which comments may be added, although the point was not raised by the appellant, is related to the following direction given to the jury:\nThis is an important case and you must agree upon a verdict. This means that you must be unanimous.\nThis is all that was said on the subject. If one of the jurors could have reasonably understood from this direction\u2014and it may be open to such construction\u2014that there was an obligation to agree upon a verdict, the direction would be bad in law. For it is not only the right but the duty of a juror to disagree if, after full and sincere consideration of the facts of the case, in the light of the directions received on the law, he is unable conscientiously to accept, after honest discussion with his colleagues, the views of the latter. To render a verdict, the jurors must be unanimous but this does not mean that they are obliged to agree, but that only a unanimity of views shall constitute a verdict bringing the case to an end. The obligation is not to agree but to co-operate honestly in the study of the facts of a case for its proper determination according to law.\nIn the presence of the misdirections above discussed, their gravity and their combined effect, I am unable to say that the respondent has affirmatively shown that there was, in the result, no substantial wrong and that justice was done according to law. And, as above indicated, the judgment rendered by the Court is that the appeal is allowed, the verdict of murder is quashed and a new trial is ordered.\nAppeal allowed and new trial directed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.E.

Clause 16 provides that: \"The Canadian Pacific, and all stations and station grounds, work shops, buildings, yards and other property, rolling stock and appurtenances required and used for the construction and working thereof, and the capital stock of the Company, shall be forever free from taxation by the Dominion, or by any province hereafter to be established, or by any municipal corporation therein \u2026\" Clause 14 gave to the Company the right to construct and work branch lines of railway from any point along its main line to any point or points within the territory of the Dominion.\nThe appellant company contended that the exemption extended to all municipal taxation upon and in respect to properties both upon its main line and upon branch lines constructed under the powers conferred by clause 14.\nHeld: (Affirming the Court of Appeal) that the exemption from taxation provided by clause 16 of the contract does not apply to the stations and station grounds, work shops, buildings, yards and other property, rolling stock and appurtenances situate on the branch lines built in Saskatchewan under the authority of clause 14 of that contract, except as to such of these properties as are also required and used for the working of the main line, as described in ss. 1, 2 and 3 of 37 Victoria, c. 14.\nHeld: (Reversing the Court of Appeal) Estey J. dissenting, that the exemption extends to the so-called business taxes referred to in the questions submitted to the Court in respect of the business carried on as a railway upon, or in connection with, the railway as described in the said sections 1, 2 and 3 of 37 Victoria, c. 14, and upon such other properties situate upon its branch lines in Saskatchewan as are entitled to the benefit of the exemption from taxation under clause 16 as being required and used for the construction and working of that portion of the line referred to in the said sections.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 1 answering certain questions referred to the Court by His Honour the Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan respecting the extent of exemption from taxation provided for the Canadian Pacific Railway by clause 16 of the contract between the Government of Canada and certain parties acting on behalf of the Company, dated October 21, 1880, and approved in 1881 by 44 Victoria, c. 1 (Canada).\nThe legislature of the Province of Saskatchewan having enacted in 1946 and 1947 certain municipal statutes to provide for (a) the assessment and taxation of the railway roadway and other lands owned by the railway companies in the province, and (b) the assessment and taxation in respect of their business carried on as a railway within the province, and certain disputes having arisen between various municipalities and the C.P.R. with respect to this legislation, the Executive Council of the Province of Saskatchewan, acting under the Constitutional Questions Act (R.S.S. 1940, c. 72), referred to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan the following questions for hearing and consideration :\nQuestion 1. Does clause 16 of the contract set forth in the Schedule to Chapter 1 of the Statutes of Canada, 44 Victoria (1881), being an Act respecting the Canadian Pacific Railway, exempt and free from taxation the stations and station grounds, work shops, buildings, yards, and other property, used for the working of the branch lines of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company situated in Saskatchewan?\nQuestion 2. Does clause 16 of the contract aforesaid exempt and free the Canadian Pacific Railway Company from taxation in Saskatchewan in respect of the business carried on as a railway\n(a) based on the area of the land or the floor space of buildings used for the purposes of such business,\n(b) based on the rental value of the land and buildings used for the purposes of such business,\n(c) based on the assessed value of the land and buildings used for the purposes of such business, but not made a charge upon such land or buildings? Question 3. Are the provisions of the said The Village Act, 1946, The Rural Municipalities Act, 1946, The Local Improvement Districts Act, 1946, The City Act, 1947, and The Town Act, 1947, all as amended, relating to the assessment and taxation of the real estate of railway companies, operative in respect of branch lines of Canadian Pacific Railway Company in the Province of Saskatchewan constructed pursuant to clause 14 of the said contract?.\nQuestion 4. Are the provisions of the said The Village Act, 1946, The Rural Municipalities Act, 1946, The Local Improvement Districts Act, 1946, The City Act, 1947, and The Town Act, 1947, all as amended, relating to the assessment and taxation of railway companies in respect of the business carried on as a railway, operative with respect to Canadian Pacific Railway Company in respect of the stations, workshops, and other buildings, used for the working of\n(a) the main line of its railway in Saskatchewan, and\n(b) its branch lines in Saskatchewan?\nThe Court of Appeal (declining to answer Questions 2(b) and 2(c)) answered Questions 1 and 2(a) in the negative and Questions 3, 4(a) and 4(b) in the affirmative (Gordon J.A. dissenting as to Questions 1 and 3).\nThis Court (Estey J. dissenting as to Questions 2 and 4), answered as follows:\nQuestion 1. No, except such properties, if any, real or personal, enumerated in clause 16, situate upon the branch lines in Saskatchewan as are entitled to the benefit of the exemption from taxation as being required and used for the construction and working of the railway described in sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Act 37 Victoria, c. 14.\nQuestion 2. Yes, as to the business carried on as a railway upon or in connection with the railway as described in sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Act 37 Victoria, c. 14, and upon such other properties, if any, real or personal, of the Company situate upon its branch lines in Saskatchewan as are entitled to the benefit of exemption from taxation under clause 16 as being required and used for the construction and working of that portion of the line referred to in the said sections of the statute.\nQuestion 3.

F. H. Carson, K.C., H. A. V. Green, K.C. and A. Find-lay for the appellant.\nE. C. Leslie, K.C. and R. S. Meldrum, K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau J. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice: The Province of Saskatchewan was established in 1905 by Statutes of Canada 4-5, Edw. VII, c. 42.\nBy force of that Statute (Section 3), the provisions of the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1886, apply to that Province \"in the same way and to the like extent as they apply to the provinces heretofore comprised in the Dominion as if the said Province of Saskatchewan had been one of the provinces originally united\", except insofar as varied by that Statute or except such provisions as are in terms made or by reasonable intendment may be held to be specially applicable to or only to affect one or more and not the whole of the said provinces.\nSection 24 of the Saskatchewan Act provides that the powers granted to the said Province shall be exercised subject to the provisions of Section 16 of the contract set forth in the Schedule to Chapter 1 of the Statutes of 1881, being An Act Respecting the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\nClause 16 of that contract provides:\n16. The Canadian Pacific Railway, and all stations and station grounds, workshops, buildings, yards and other property, rolling stock and appurtenances required and used for the construction and working thereof, and the capital stock of the Company, shall be forever free from taxation by the Dominion or by any province hereafter to be established, or by any Municipal Corporation therein; and the lands of the Company, in the North-West Territories, until they are either sold or occupied, shall also be free from such taxation for twenty years after the grant thereof from the Crown.\nClause 1 of the contract provides:\n1. For the better interpretation of this contract, it is hereby declared that the portion of railway hereinafter called the Eastern section, shall comprise that part of the Canadian Pacific Railway to be constructed, extending from the Western terminus of the Canada Central Railway, near the East end of Lake Nipissing, known as Callander Station, to a point of junction with that portion of the said Canadian Pacific Railway now in course of construction extending from Lake Superior to Selkirk on the East side of Red River; which latter portion is hereinafter called the Lake Superior section. That the portion of said railway, now partially in course of construction, extending from Selkirk to Kamloops, is hereinafter called the Central section; and the portion of said railway now in course of construction, extending from Kamloops to Port Moody, is hereinafter called the Western section. And that the words \"The Canadian Pacific Railway\", are intended to mean the entire railway, as described in the Act 37th Victoria, chap. 14. The individual parties hereto, are hereinafter described as the Company; and the Government of Canada is hereinafter called the Government.\nThe description referred to in the Act 37th Vict. c. 14, is contained in Sections 1 to 4 of that Statute and reads as follows:\n1. A railway to be called the \"Canadian Pacific Railway\" shall be made from some point near to and south of Lake Nipissing to some point in British Columbia on the Pacific Ocean, both the said points to be determined and the course and line of the said railway to be approved of by the Governor in Council.\n2. The whole line of the said railway, for the purpose of its construction, shall be divided into four sections: the first section to begin at a point near to and south of Lake Nipissing, and to extend towards the upper or western end of Lake Superior, to a point where it shall intersect the second section hereinafter mentioned; the second section to begin at some point on Lake Superior to be determined by the Governor in Council, and connecting with the first section, and to extend to Red River, in the Province of Manitoba; the third section to extend from Red River, in the Province of Manitoba, to some point between Fort Edmonton and the foot of the Rocky Mountains, to be determined by the Governor in Council; the fourth section to extend from the western terminus of the third section to some point in British Columbia on the Pacific Ocean.\n3. Branches of the said railway shall also be constructed as follows; that is to say:\nFirst\u2014A branch from the point indicated as the proposed eastern terminus of the said railway to some point on the Georgian Bay, both the said points to be determined by the Governor in Council.\nSecondly\u2014a branch from the main line near Fort Garry, in the Province of Manitoba, to some point near Pembina on the southern boundary thereof.\n4. The branch railways above mentioned shall, for all intents and purposes, be considered as forming part of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and as so many distinct sections of the said railway, and shall be subject to all the provisions hereinafter made with respect to the said Canadian Pacific Railway, except in so far as it may be otherwise provided for by this Act.\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Company was constituted pursuant to Statutes of Canada, 44 Vict., c. 1, assented to on the 15th of February, 1881, by Letters Patent granted by His Excellency the Governor-General under the Great Seal of Canada, under date 16th February, 1881.\nThe contract which the Court is called upon to construe was executed between the Crown, in the right of the Dominion of Canada, and George Stephen and others relating to the Canadian Pacific Railway and was dated October 21, 1880. It was appended as a Schedule to the Statute 44 Vict. c. 1, and it was ratified by that Statute; the wording of the contract being incorporated in the Letters Patent.\nSection 4 of the Schedule to the said contract provides that\nAll the franchises and powers necessary or useful to the Company to enable them to carry out, perform, enforce, use, and avail themselves of, every condition, stipulation, obligation, duty, right, remedy, privilege, and advantage agreed upon, contained or described in the said contract, are hereby conferred upon the Company.\nThe contract provides for the incorporation of Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the construction by it of a main line of railway from Callendar Station near Lake Nipissing, in the Province of Ontario, the western terminus of the existing railway system of Canada, to Port Moody located on the seaboard of British Columbia.\nThe contract provided for the construction of branch lines by Clause 14 as follows:\n14. The Company shall have the right from time to time, to lay out, construct, equip, maintain, and work branch lines of railway from any point or points along their main line of railway, to any point or points within the territory of the Dominion. Provided always, that before commencing any branch they shall first deposit a map and plan of such branch in the Department of Railways. And the Government shall grant to the Company the lands required for the road bed of such branches, and for the stations, station grounds, buildings, workshops, yards and other appurtenances requisite for the efficient construction and working of such branches, in so far as such lands are vested in the Government.\nThe area through which the Canadian Pacific Railway was to be constructed between the western boundary of Manitoba, as then constituted, and the eastern boundary of British Columbia was then part of the North-West Territories and was administered by the Dominion Government.\nThe Province of Saskatchewan, having been established as aforesaid in 1905, certain municipal statutes were subsequently passed in the years 1946 and 1947, which provided:\n(a) That the railway roadway and other land within the province owned by railway companies shall be assessed and taxed, and\n(b) That railway companies, whether their property is liable to assessment and taxation or not, shall be liable to assessment and taxation in respect of the business carried on as a railway within the Province at a rate per square foot of the floor space of each building or part thereof used for business purposes.\nDisputes having arisen between various municipalities and the Canadian Pacific Railway with respect to the latter legislation, the Executive Council of the Province of Saskatchewan, on the recommendation of the Attorney-General and pursuant to the provisions of the Constitutional Questions Act, being c. 72 of the Revised Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1940, was pleased to refer to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 2 the following questions for hearing and consideration (see ante, p. 191).\nThe Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan by a majority answered \"No\" to Questions Nos. 1 and 2(a); \"Yes\" to Questions Nos. 3, 4(a) and 4(b); but declined to answer Questions Nos. 2(b) and 2(c). Mr. Justice Gordon dissented as to the answer given by the majority of the Court to Questions Nos. 1 and 3.\nFrom that judgment the Canadian Pacific Railway Company appeals to this Court and we heard counsel for the Company and for the Attorney-General for Saskatchewan.\nIt is apparent that the answers to be given to the several questions submitted to the Court depend upon the construction to be put on the contract between the Crown and George Stephen and others already referred to, and, more particularly, on Sections 1, 14, 16 and 22 thereof.\nSections 1, 14 and 16 form part of the Order of Reference and have been above reproduced.\nSection 22 reads as follows:\n22. The Railway Act of 1879, in so far as the provisions of the same are applicable to the undertaking referred to in this contract, and in so far as they are not inconsistent herewith or inconsistent with or contrary to the provisions of the Act of incorporation to be granted to the Company, shall apply to the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nBy Questions 1 and 3 the Court of Appeal was asked, in effect, whether the freedom from taxation in Clause 16 applies to branch lines constructed under the authority of Clause 14 of the contract.\nBy Questions 2 and 4 the Court of Appeal was asked, in effect, whether the freedom from taxation in Clause 16 applies to business taxes provided for in certain Statutes of the Province of Saskatchewan.\nIt will be observed that Question No. 1 is so worded as to apply to all branch lines of the Appellant in Saskatchewan. In the Court of Appeal, however, only branch lines constructed under the authority of the contract were in issue and the Appellant stated in this Court that it did not contend that the freedom from taxation in Clause 16 of the contract extends to branch lines other than those constructed under the authority of Clause 14.\nThe same observation should not be made of Question No. 3, since it is in terms limited to branch lines constructed pursuant to Clause 14.\nThe Company submitted that the true answer to be given to Question No. 1 should be in the affirmative; but that even if the Court of Appeal was to be upheld in its view, then Question No. 1 should not be answered unreservedly in the negative, but that there should be added to the word \"No\" the following words:\n\u2026 Provided, however, that Clause 16 does exempt and free from taxation such stations and station grounds, workshops, buildings, yards and other property required and used for the construction and working of the Canadian Pacific Railway (meaning \"the entire railway as described in the Act 37 Vict. c. 14\", that is to say: the four main line sections, the Georgian Bay branch, the Pembina branch and the Winnipeg Branch).\nThe Company further submitted that Question No. 3 should be answered in the negative; but that, at all events, if the Court of Appeal should be upheld in its view, Question No. 3 should not be answered unreservedly in the affirmative, but that there should be added to the word \"Yes\" the following words:\n\u2026 Provided, however, that such provisions are not operative in respect of stations and station grounds, workshops, buildings, yards and other property located on such branch lines and required and used for the construction and working of the Canadian Pacific Railway (meaning \"the entire railway as described in the Act 37 Vict. c. 14\", that is to say: the four main line sections, the Georgian Bay branch, the Pembina branch and the Winnipeg branch).\nAs to Question No. 2, the Company submitted that it should be answered in the affirmative and that Question No. 4 should be answered in the negative.\nAt bar, counsel for the Respondent stated that the Province would be agreeable to a qualified answer being given to Question No. 1, so that it would read as follows:\nNo. Provided, however, that the fact that such property is used for the working of the branch lines would not, of itself, defeat any exemption to which such property might be entitled by reason of its being required and used for the working of the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway in Saskatchewan.\nOf the Statute of Canada of 1881 (44 Vict., c. 1), which is entitled \"An Act Respecting the Canadian Pacific Railway\", very little need be said. The preamble states that the Parliament of Canada has expressed a preference for the construction and operation of the railway by means of an incorporated company aided by grants of money and land and that certain statutes have been passed to enable that course to be followed, but the enactments therein contained have not been effectual for that purpose.\nIt further states that a contract has been entered into for the construction of the railway; that the contract has been laid before Parliament and that it is expedient to approve and ratify it, as well as to make provision for the carrying out of the same.\nA copy of the contract is annexed to the Statute. It is declared. approved and ratified and the Government is authorized to perform and carry out the conditions thereof; and that, for the purpose of incorporating the persons mentioned in the contract and those who shall be associated with them in the undertaking the Governor may grant to them, in conformity with the contract, under the corporate name of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, a charter conferring upon them the franchises, privileges and powers embodied in the schedule, and that such charter, being published in the Canada Gazette, shall have force and effect as if it were an Act of Parliament, and shall be held to be an Act of incorporation within the meaning of the contract.\nThe Statute provides that the Government may make to the Company certain grants of money and land upon the terms and conditions agreed upon in the contract; that the Government may permit the admission free of duty of certain materials to be used in the original construction of the railway and convey to the Company the possession of and right to work and run the several portions of the railway, as the same shall be hereafter completed; and the Government shall also take security for the continuous operation of the railway during the ten years next subsequent to the completion thereof in the manner provided by the contract.\nIt is apparent, therefore, that the Statute, in effect, was passed with the object of approving and ratifying the contract without adding anything to it and that it is to the contract, and not to the Statute, that we must look for the purpose of answering the questions submitted to the Court.\nThe difference is important for a term of a contract is quite another thing from an exemption section in a taxing Act. Canadian Pacific Railway v. Burnett 3.\nHere, the Appellant does not claim a special treatment as was the case decided by the Judicial Committee in Montreal v. Coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Marie 4. The exemptions claimed by the Appellant are the result of a quid pro quo, the company receiving these exemptions as a consideration for the fact that they undertook the construction and the working of the railway throughout Canada. In that respect, the Statute added nothing to the consideration given by the Government; the provisions relating thereto are entirely contained in the contract.\nNow, Clause 1 of the contract is stated to be inserted \"for the better interpretation of this contract\". It may be said, however, that the definition there given of \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" far from helping in that interpretation is rather confusing. It states that the words \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" are intended to mean the entire railway, as described in the Act 37 Vict., c. 14, and it adds that the individual parties to the contract \"are hereinafter described as the Company\". As a matter of fact, the entire railway, as described in that Act of 1874, consisted of seven sections, four of which were described in Section 2, two of which were described in Sections 3 and 4, and the seventh of which was described in an Amending Act of 1879, this Amending Act expressly providing that all the provisions of the 1874 Act, with respect to branches of the railway, were to apply to this added branch. The seventh section of the 1874 railway, known as the Winnipeg Branch, is not expressly mentioned in the contract. It had, however, at that time been constructed, or was in the course of construction, probably as part of the main line, and it was conveyed to the Company pursuant to Clause 7 of the contract.\nBut, by Clause 1 of the contract of 1880, only four sections are provided for. The section corresponding with the first section of the 1874 railway is called the Eastern Section. The section corresponding with the second section of the 1874 railway is called the Lake Superior Section. The section extending from Selkirk to Kamloops is called the Central Section which corresponds with the third section and part of the fourth section of the 1874 railway; and the section extending from Kamloops to Port Moody is called the Western Section and corresponds with part of the fourth section of the 1874 railway.\nThe fifth section of the 1874 railway, known as the Georgian Bay branch, is not provided for in the contract of 1880 and was never built.\nThe sixth section of the 1874 railway, known as the Pembina branch, is not expressly mentioned in the contract of 1880. It had then been completed and was later conveyed to the Company pursuant to Clause 7 of the contract.\nThe seventh section of the 1874 railway, known as the Winnipeg branch, is not provided for by the contract of 1880, and, as such, was not built.\nBy the contract, the Government was to cause to be completed the Lake Superior section and the Western section. The Company was to construct the Eastern section and the Central section. Upon completion of those two last sections by the Company, the Government was to convey to the Company those parts of the railway which the Government undertook to construct.\nThus, the railway contemplated by the 1880 contract is not accurately described in Clause 1 thereof in the Act 37 Vict., c. 14 (1874); and one may not rely upon that so-called description for the purpose of construing the contract of 1880, for the railway provided for by the 1880 contract was a different railway from the entire railway described in the 1874 Act.\nIt is common ground that one of the principal concepts underlying the 1880 contract was for the purpose of constructing a railway to open up the North-West Territories. For this purpose, the railway was to consist of a main line and of an indeterminate number of branches, as shown by the authority given to the contractors by Clause 14. By that clause, the Company was given the right, from time to time, to lay out, construct, equip, maintain and work branch lines of railways from any point or points along their main line to any point or points within the territory of the Dominion. The only proviso was that before commencing any branch the railway had first to deposit a map and plan of such branch in the Department of Railways. Further, the Government undertook to grant to the Company the lands required for the road bed of such branches and for the stations, station grounds, buildings, workshops, yards and other appurtenances requisite for the efficient construction and working of such branches, insofar as such lands were vested in the Government.\nMoreover, for twenty years from the date of the contract, no line of railway was to be authorized by the Dominion Parliament to be constructed South of the Canadian Pacific Railway from any point at or near the railway, except such line as shall run South West or to the Westward of South West; nor to within fifteen miles of Latitude 49. And in the establishment of any new province in the North-West Territories, provision shall be made for continuing such prohibition after such establishment until the expiration of the said period of twenty years (Clause 15 of the 1880 contract).\nIt is quite clear, therefore, that describing the railway contemplated by the contract as being described in the Act 37 Vict. c. 14 (1874) was quite inappropriate. If it had any meaning at all, it must have been for the purpose of identifying the Canadian Pacific Railway for the construction of which the Act of 1874 provided. It must be given a meaning and I cannot find any other.\nNow, Question No. 1 is put in respect of stations and station grounds, workshops, buildings, yards and other property used for the working of the branch lines \u2026.. situated in Saskatchewan.\nIf we turn to the railway described in Sections 1 to 4 of the Statute 37 Vict. cap. 14, it is to be noted that the branches are there specifically described as \"a branch from the point indicated as the proposed eastern terminus of the said railway to some point on the Georgian Bay\" and \"a branch from the main line near Fort Garry, in the Province of Manitoba, to some point near Pembina on the southern boundary thereof\"; and Section 4 states that \"the branch railways above mentioned shall be considered as forming part of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and as so many distinct sections of the said railway, and shall be subject to all the provisions hereinafter made with respect to the said Canadian Pacific Railway\".\nIt would seem to me, therefore, that the branch lines to which the benefit of the exemption applies, under Clause 16 of the contract, were meant to be only those which are described in Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Act 37 Vict. cap. 14 and not to apply to the branch lines referred to in Clause 14 of the contract, which were not included in the description contained in Sections 3 and 4 of the Act 37 Vict.\nThis conclusion, however, should be qualified, as suggested by the Appellant, by saying that Clause 16 does exempt and free from taxation such stations and station grounds, workshops, buildings, yards and other property required and used for the construction and working of the entire railway as described in the Act 37 Vict. cap. 14.\nThis qualification, moreover, agrees with the statement made by counsel for the Respondent to the effect \"that the fact that such property is used for the working of the branch lines would not, of itself, defeat any exemption to which such property might be entitled by reason of its being required and used for the working of the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway in Saskatchewan\".\nBy force of Section 4 of Schedule \"A\", annexed to the contract, and referred to in Section 21 thereof (already reproduced at the beginning of these reasons), all the advantages agreed upon, contained or described in the contract of 1880 were \"conferred upon the company\", but, of course, this cannot be read as having extended the tax exemption. What the company thereby acquired was the exemption described in Section 16 of the contract and nothing more.\nThis is further emphasized by the wording of the \"Act Respecting the Canadian Pacific Railway\" (44 Vict. c. 1). By that Statute, the contract was approved and ratified and it was therein provided that for the purpose of incorporating the persons mentioned in the contract and those who shall be associated with them in the undertaking, the Governor may grant to them in conformity with the contract, under the corporate name of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, a charter conferring upon them the franchises, privileges and powers embodied in the schedule. This made clear the intention of Parliament that the tax exemption contained in Clause 16 was conferred upon the company exactly as described in the said clause. The object was only to specify that the exemption was to apply to the corporate entity or person, but only in respect of the property described in Clause 16 (Provincial Treasurer of Alberta v. Kerr 5; Lindley J. in Hartley v. Hudson 6).\nAs for the business tax, that is only a form of municipal taxation and as, under Clause 16 of the contract and Section 4 of the Schedule, the company is \"forever free from taxation by the Dominion or by any province hereafter to be established, or by any municipal corporation therein\", I am of opinion that, as to the business carried on as a railway (both main line and branches, as described in Sections 1 to 4 of the Act 37 Vict. cap. 14), Clause 16 of the contract exempts and frees the Canadian Pacific Railway Company from taxation in Saskatchewan in respect of its business.\nIn 1905, when the Province of Saskatchewan was constituted, Section 24 of the Saskatchewan Act provided that the powers of the province should be exercised subject to Clause 16 of the contract. The Respondent is, therefore, bound by that clause, and, in my humble opinion, the answer to each of the questions submitted should be as follows:\n1. Question No. 1\u2014No, provided, however, that the fact that such property is used for the working of the branch lines would not, of itself, defeat any exemption to which such property might be entitled by reason of its being required and used for the working of the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway in Saskatchewan;\n2. Questions Nos. 2(a), (b) and (c)\u2014Yes. As to the business carried on as a railway (both main line and branches, as described in Sections 1 to 4 of the Act 37 Vict. cap. 14), Clause 16 of the contract exempts and frees the Canadian Pacific Railway Company from taxation in Saskatchewan in respect of its business;\n3. Question No. 3\u2014Yes, provided, however, that such provisions are not operative in respect of stations and station grounds, workshops, buildings, yards and other property located on such branch lines and required and used for the construction and working of the Canadian Pacific Railway, as described in the Act 37 Vict. cap. 14;\n4. Question No. 4(a)\u2014No; Question No. 4(b)\u2014Yes, subject to the limitations already stated in the answers to Questions Nos. 1, 2(a), (b), (c) and to Question No. 3.\nFor the above reasons, the appeal should be allowed, in accordance with the above answers, with one-half of its costs of this appeal to the Appellant.\nKerwin J.: I agree with the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Locke.\nKellock, J. This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 7 answering certain questions referred to that Court by the Lieutenant Governor in Council.\nStated generally, the questions involve the extent of exemption from taxation provided for by paragraph 16 of the contract of October 21, 1880, and approved by 44 Vic. c. 1, Canada (1881).\nAppellant first contends that the exemption extends to branch lines which the appellant was authorized by paragraph 14 of the contract from \"time to time\" to construct and work. These paragraphs are as follows:\n14. The Company shall have the right, from time to time, to layout, construct, equip, maintain and work branch lines of railway from any point or points along their main line of railway, to any point or points within the territory of the Dominion. Provided always, that before commencng any branch they shall first deposit a map and plan of such branch in the Department of Railways. And the Government shall grant to the Company the lands required for the road bed of such branches, and for the stations, station grounds, buildings, workshops, yards and other appurtenances requisite for the efficient construction and -working of such branches, in so far as such lands are vested in the Government.\n16. The Canadian Pacific Railway, and all stations and station grounds, work shops, buildings, yards and other property, rolling stock and appurtenances required and used for the construction and working thereof, and the capital stock of the Company, shall be forever free from taxation by the Dominion, or by any Province hereafter to be established, or by any Municipal Corporation therein; and the lands of the Company, in the North-West Territories, until they are either sold or occupied, shall also be free from such taxation for 20 years after the grant thereof from the Crown.\nAppellant says that \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" in paragraph 16 includes the branch lines contemplated by paragraph 14, while the contention of the respondent is that, by reason of the definition of \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" in paragraph 1 of the contract, the appellant's contention is excluded. Paragraph 1 together with the introductory words with which the contract commences are as follows:\nThat the parties hereto have contracted and agreed with each other as follows, namely:\n1. For the better interpretation of this contract, it is hereby declared that the portion of railway hereinafter called the Eastern section, shall comprise that part of the Canadian Pacific Railway to be constructed, extending from the Western terminus of the Canada Central Railway, near the East end of Lake Nipissing, known, as Callander Station, to a point of junction with that portion of the said Canadian Pacific Railway now in the course of construction extending from Lake Superior to Selkirk on the East side of Red River; which latter portion is hereinafter called the Lake Superior section. That the portion of said railway, now partially in course of construction, extending from Selkirk to Kamloops, is hereinafter called the Central section; and the portion of said railway now in course of construction, extending from Kamloops to Pont Moody, is hereinafter called the Western section. And that the words \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" are intended to mean the entire railway, as described in the Act 37th Victoria, chap. 14. The individual parties hereto, are hereinafter described as the Company; and the Government of Canada is hereinafter called the Government.\n\"The entire railway, as described in the Act 37th Victoria, c. 14\" is to be found in the first four sections of that statute. Section 1 reads:\nA railway, to be called the \"Canadian Pacific Railway\", shall be made from some point near to and south of Lake Nipissing to some point in British Columbia on the Pacific Ocean, both said points to be determined and the course and line of the said railway to be approved of by the Governor in Council.\nBy section 2 it is provided that the whole line of the said railway shall be divided into four sections, and the sections are delimited therein. Sections 3 and 4 are as follows:\n3. Branches of the said railway shall also be constructed as follows, that is to say:\nFirst:\u2014A branch from the point indicated as the proposed eastern terminus of the said railway to some point on the Georgian Bay, both the said points to be determined by the Governor in Council.\nSecondly:\u2014A branch from the main line near Fort Garry, in the Province of Manitoba, to some point near Pembina on the southern boundary thereof.\n4. The branch, railway above mentioned shall, for all intents and purposes, be considered as forming part of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and as so many distinct sections of the said railway, and shall be subject to all the provisions hereinafter made with respect to the said Canadian Pacific Railway, except in so far as it may be otherwise provided for by this Act. Mr. Carson, for the appellant, contends that the definition of \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" in paragraph 1 of the contract applies only for the purposes of that paragraph and not throughout the contract.\nPrima facie, that contention is unsound. The opening words, \"For the better interpretation of this contract it is hereby declared\", apply not only to what follows in the first sentence, but to the third sentence. As far as is relevant to the point with which we are here concerned, the paragraph reads:\nFor the better interpretation of this contract, it is hereby declared that \u2026 And that the words \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" are intended to mean the entire railway, as described in the Act 37th Victoria, chap. 14.\nUnless, therefore, there are compelling reasons in any particular context to the contrary, the definition is to be applied throughout the contract.\nMr. Carson bases his contention upon what he contends to be a fact, namely, that the Georgian Bay branch had, at the date of the contract, been abandoned to the knowledge of both parties, and that the 1874 railway, with or without the amendment of 1879, was not therefore, in contemplation as the subject matter of the contract, but something less than that.\nIn the first place, however, the alleged abandonment of the branch has not been shown as a matter of fact at all. All that appears upon the material to which Mr. Carson refers, namely, the report of the Royal Commission of 8th April, 1882, and the Order in Council of July 25, 1879, is abandonment of a contract for the construction of a part of that branch. The report deals with \"Contract No. 37\" dated 2nd August, 1878, by which certain named contractors undertook to complete certain work in connection with some fifty miles of the Georgian Bay branch. The report states that \"before much progress had been made under this contract, the Government adopted a policy of discontinuing the construction of the Georgian Bay branch, and the following Order in Council was passed.\" On referring to the above Order in Council, however, all it provides for is that it was \"not the intention of the Government to proceed further with the work under this contract\" and that instructions should be given to stop the work. By a subsequent Order in Council of 14th August, 1879, the contract was \"taken out of their\" (the contractors') \"hands and annulled.\" Counsel also refers to certain evidence given by the late Sir Charles Tupper before the Commission, but this evidence is similarly restricted to the \"reason for abandoning the Georgian Bay branch which was under contract with Heney, Charlebois and Co.\" It does not go beyond the Orders in Council.\nIt is noteworthy that in the report itself, reference is made to an earlier contract with a Mr. Foster, \"No. 12\", concerning the Georgian Bay branch having been annulled by an Order in Council of February 28, 1876, as the route named in that contract had presented more engineering difficulties than were anticipated, and a new survey had to be made for the route in question in Contract No. 37. What happened in connection with these two contracts illustrates a situation by no means unique at that time, when contractors defaulted on their contracts to build a part or parts of the Canadian Pacific. This did not mean the abandonment of the intention to construct the \"railway\" or even the particular parts which formed the subject matter of the contracts. The very contract here in question, in paragraph 5, indicates that the Government had had the same experience with contractors for the 100 miles of railway extending west of the City of Winnipeg, and had had to take that work out of the hands of the contractor.\nThe most striking thing, however, in negation of the appellant's contention is that, after the Orders in Council of 1879, the \"Canadian Pacific Railway\" was defined both in the contract here in question and in the statute confirming it by express reference to the 1874 statute. This shows clearly in my opinion that the 1874 railway in its entirity, including the Georgian Bay branch, was in the contemplation of the contracting parties, unaffected by the fact that in the preceding year the Government had had to take the contract for the fifty mile stretch out of the hands of the then contractors. As a matter of fact, in 1883 the company itself commenced construction of a branch line from Sudbury to Sault Ste. Marie and completed it in 1886 prior to the completion date fixed by paragraphs 4 and 6 of the contract of 1880 here in question. This appears in the case filed in the Branch Lines case8. This \"Algoma\" branch is referred to in 48-49 Vict. c. 57. At page 45 of 36 S.C.R. it is stated that by 1884 this branch line had been constructed \"as far as Algoma on the Georgian Bay.\" It may be\u2014there is no evidence one way or the other\u2014that the Georgian Bay branch contemplated by Section 3 of the 1874 Act was abandoned after the date of the contract, in favour of this Algoma branch. However that may be, the appellant has failed, in. my opinion, to establish the factual basis it seeks to establish for its contention. I think, therefore, that the definition in paragraph 1 should be employed, as that paragraph says, for the better interpretation of this \"contract\" and not simply for the purposes of paragraph 1.\nThat the words \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" were deliberately intended to \"mean\" the \"entire\" railway as described in the Act 37th Victoria, c. 14, is, I think, further emphasized by the fact that prior to the contract here in question, the statute of 1879, 42 Victoria, c. 14, had been passed. Section 1 reads as follows:\nA branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway shall be constructed from some point west of the Red River, on that part of the main line running south of Lake Manitoba, to the City of Winnipeg, so as to connect with the branch line from Fort Garry to Pembina; and all the provisions of \"the Canadian Pacific Railway Act, 1874\" with respect to branches of the said railway not inconsistent with this Act shall apply to the branch to be constructed under this Act.\nWe were informed on the argument that this 1879 branch had, at the time of the contract, become a part of the main line. By this it must be meant that, at the time of the Act of 1879, the main line as projected was to pass north of the City of Winnipeg and that, by the date of the contract, this plan had been changed in favour of one which would, by placing the City of Winnipeg on the main line do away with the necessity for construction of this branch. Under the provisions of section 1 of the Act of 1874, the main line had not been more definitely located by the statute than from \"some point near to and south of Lake Nipissing to some point in British Columbia on the Pacific Ocean,\" both of these points and the course of the line itself to be approved by the Governor in Council. Section 2 did not more closely fix the location of the main line in Manitoba than \"the second section to begin at some point on Lake Superior, to be determined by the Governor in Council, and connecting with the first section, and to extend to the Red River in the Province of Manitoba; the third section to extend from Red River in the Province of Manitoba to some point between Fort Edmonton and the foot of the Rocky Mountains, to be determined by the Governor in Council.\"\nAccordingly, it was competent for the Governor in Council, as well after the Act of 1879 as before, to determine the course of the main line so as to pass through the City of Winnipeg, and it had evidently become unnecessary, in settling the contract of 1880, to refer to the amendment of 1879 because of the change in the projected route of the main line. The choice of language in paragraph 1, that \"the words 'the Canadian Pacific Railway' are intended to mean the entire railway as described in the Act 37th Victoria, chap. 14\", accordingly meant. what they said, namely, the main line as described in that statute as it might be located by the Governor in Council, together with the two branches therein mentioned, and nothing else. The Georgian Bay branch was thus deliberately included and there could have been no intention to abandon it at that time.\nFar from finding anything in other parts of the contract which casts doubt on the view just expressed, the contract is consistent throughout when the definition in the first paragraph is employed as that paragraph instructs, namely, for the better interpretation \"of this contract.\"\nUnder paragraph 3, the company was to Construct and equip the Eastern and Central sections, and by paragraph 4 these sections were to be completed, equipped and in running order by the 1st of May, 1891, subject to certain events therein provided for. By paragraph 6, the Government assumed the obligation of completing the Lake Superior and Western sections, the latest date set for completion being also the 1st of May, 1891.\nParagraph 7 is as follows:\nThe railway constructed under the terms hereof shall be the property, of the Company: and pending the completion of the Eastern and Central sections, the Government shall transfer to the Company the possession and right to work and run the several portions of the Canadian Pacific Railway already constructed or as the same shall be completed, and upon the completion of the Eastern and Central sections, the Government shall convey to the Company, with a suitable number of station buildings and with water service (but without equipment), those portions of the Canadian Pacific Railway constructed or to be constructed by the Government which shall then be completed; and upon completion of the remainder of the portion of railway to be constructed by the Government, that portion shall also be conveyed to the Company; and the Canadian Pacific Railway shall become and be thereafter the absolute property of the Company. And the Company shall thereafter and forever efficiently maintain, work and run the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nThe language with which this paragraph begins,\nThe railway constructed under the terms hereof shall be the property of the Company.\nshould, I think, be interpreted in the light of the words in the last two sentences of the paragraph and the confirming statute itself. With respect to possession and right to operate, the paragraph provides that, pending completion of the Eastern and Central sections, the Government should transfer to the company the possession and right to operate\nthe several portions of the Canadian Pacific Railway already constructed or as the same shall be completed.\nThis language would entitle the company, immediately upon the execution of the contract, to delivery of possession of all portions of \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" already constructed at the date of the contract, and to possession of the remainder as it became progressively finished.\nIn the third paragraph of the preamble of the statute, it is stated that certain sections of the \"said\" railway had already been constructed by the Government, while others were in course of construction, the greater portion of the \"main line thereof\", however, not having yet been commenced or placed under contract, and it was necessary in the interests of good faith to \"complete and operate the whole of the said railway.\"\nThe fourth paragraph of the preamble states that a contract had been entered into for the construction of \"the said portion of the main line of the said railway\" (that is, that portion of the main line of the 1874 railway not then commenced or placed under contract) and for\nthe permanent working of the whole line thereof.\nThere can be little doubt that the \"whole of the said railway\" was the 1874 railway as defined by the Act 37th Victoria, c. 14, in view of the clear statements to that effect in sections 4, 5 and 6. I think \"the whole of the said railway\" and \"the whole line thereof\" mean the same thing. No one suggests, least of all the appellant, that the contract did not entitle the appellant to a conveyance of the Pembina branch, which was not, of course, part of the \"main line.\"\nIn my opinion, these considerations throw light upon the construction of the second sentence of paragraph 7. This provides that, upon completion of the Eastern and Central sections, the Government should convey to the company\nthose portions of the Canadian Pacific Railway constructed or to be constructed by the Government which shall then be completed.\nThe corresponding language in section 5 of the statute is\nthose portions of the Canadian Pacific Railway constructed, or agreed by the said contract to be constructed by the Government, which shall then be completed.\nThis language would entitle the company to a conveyance of the portions of railway already in existence at the date of the contract and (reading the language as set out in the section) the Lake Superior and Western sections only. However, the paragraph goes on to provide that\nupon completion of the remainder of the portion of railway to be constructed by the Government, that portion shall also be conveyed to the Company.\nIt is noteworthy that after the word \"Government\" there is no such wording as \"under the contract\" or \"as provided by the contract\", and in my opinion this fact is significant. I think that \"the remainder\" includes all of the 1874 railway including its branches, and that construction is borne out by the reference to the preamble already made and to the concluding parts of paragraph 7 of the contract. It is \"the Canadian Pacific Railway defined as aforesaid\" which is \"thereafter\" to be the absolute property of the company. It is, therefore, the entire railway of 1874 and \"thereafter\" must mean upon the completion of that railway.\nThe reiteration in sections 5 and 6 of the statute of the definition employed in paragraph 1 of the contract, and the use of \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" three times in paragraph 7 renders it imperative, in my opinion, to read these words as inclusive of the 1874 railway in its entirety and exclusive of anything else including branches which might or might not be built in pursuance of the power conferred by paragraph 14 of the contract.\nUnder paragraph 17, the Government was entitled to retain certain bonds, if issued by the company, as security \"for the due performance of the present contract in respect of the maintenance and continuous working of the railway by the company as herein agreed for ten years after the completion thereof.\" It was also provided that if there was no default in the maintenance and working of \"the said Canadian Pacific Railway\", the Government would not ask for interest on these bonds. It would, of course, be absurd to say that \"the railway\" or \"the said Canadian Pacific Railway\" in paragraph 17 included paragraph 14 branches, for the reason that the period of \"ten years after the completion thereof\" would never begin to run. The railway which was to become the property of the company after completion and thereafter to be maintained and worked by it as provided by paragraph 7 was clearly the 1874 railway to the exclusion of the paragraph 14 branches, and the security to be given under paragraph 17 was to be given, if the bonds were issued, for the period ending upon the expiration of ten years after the completion of that railway.\nBy paragraph 9, provision is made for the granting of subsidies of land and money, for which subsidies \"the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway shall be completed and the same shall be equipped, maintained and operated.\" This paragraph, like paragraph 7, would appear to proceed on the assumption that, if the company carried out its part of the work of construction, i.e. the Eastern and Central sections, this would \"complete\" the construction of the whole, as the Government was to construct the remainder so that the Company would be enabled to carry out its obligation to equip, maintain and operate the whole.\nParagraph 10 provides for the grant by the Government to the company of the lands required for the road bed of \"the railway\" and for its stations, station grounds, workshops, dock ground and water frontage at the termini on navigable waters, buildings, yards and other appurtenances required for the effectual construction and working of \"the railway\" insofar as such land shall be vested in the Govern- ment. It is plain, in my opinion, that \"the railway\" as used twice above does not include the branch lines authorized by paragraph 14, if for no other reason than that in the last mentioned paragraph there is a specific provision that the Government should grant to the company the land required for the road bed of branches constructed thereunder and for the stations, station grounds, buildings, workshops, yards and other appurtenances requisite for the efficient construction and working of such branches. This, in my opinion, is the plainest indication that \"the railway\" in paragraph 10 means the railway as defined in paragraph 1, and that the branches comprised within paragraph 14 are not part of that railway, that is, \"the Canadian Pacific Railway.\"\nParagraph 15 is as follows:\nFor twenty years from the date hereof, no line of railway shall be authorized by the Dominion Parliament to be constructed South of the Canadian Pacific Railway, from any point at or near the Canadian Pacific Railway, except such line as shall run South West or to the Westward of South West; nor to within fifteen miles of Latitude 49. And in the establishment of any new Province in the North-West Territories, provision shall be made for continuing such prohibition after such establishment until the expiration of the said period.\nI think this paragraph is to be read consistently with the definition in paragraph 1. It means, in my opinion, that Parliament may not authorize another line except such as shall (a) have as its southerly terminus a point nearer to the international border than fifteen miles; (b) run in the specified direction; and (c) have as its northerly terminus any point \"at or near\" the main line or either branch line.\nBy paragraph 22 it is provided that the Railway Act of 1879, insofar as applicable to the undertaking referred to in the contract and insofar as not inconsistent with the contract itself or the Act of incorporation to be granted to the company, shall apply to \"the Canadian Pacific Railway.\" I see no difficulty again in applying the definition in paragraph 1 to this paragraph. \"The Canadian Pacific Railway\" and \"the company\" are expressly and separately referred to in the paragraph. In my opinion, it is perfectly clear and the definition clearly applies.\nIt is significant that when one comes to Schedule \"A\" to the contract, the first use of the words \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" is in paragraph 15 which contains a description of what is intended thereby and what is intended when those words are \"hereinafter\" used in the schedule. In this description and definition the branches authorized by paragraph 14 of the contract are specifically taken in by the use of the words \"other branches to be located by the company from time to time as provided by the said contract.\"\nAgain in paragraph 18 (d) of the schedule there is an express distinction drawn between the \"main line\" and \"any branch of such railway hereafter to be located by the said company in respect of which the approval of the Governor in Council shall not be necessary\" (i.e. branches to be located as authorized by paragraph 14 of the contract by simply filing a plan.)\nThe view to which I have come, negativing the appellant's contention on the first branch of this case, is, I think, confirmed by the provisions of the confirming statute, 44 Victoria, c. 1. I have already referred to certain parts of the preamble.\nSection 3 provides for a subsidy in favour of the company in consideration of the \"completion and efficient operation\" of the \"railway\" as stipulated in the contract. So far as construction was concerned, the company was limited to the Eastern and Central sections but as to operation it was interested in the whole. As in the case of paragraphs 7 and 9 of the contract, this section appears to proceed on the assumption that \"completion\" of the entire railway would be effected if the company built the Eastern and Central sections, as the Government would see to the rest.\nSection 4 provides for the admission duty free of materials to be used in the original construction of \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" and of a telegraph line in connection \"therewith\" and for all telegraphic apparatus required for the first equipment of \"such telegraph line\" as provided by paragraph 10 of the contract. In my opinion, the telegraph line envisaged by this section in connection with \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" was the same telegraph line as is described in section 5 of the Act of 1874, namely, a line of electric telegraph along the \"whole extent respectively\" of the \"said railway and branches\", i.e. the Pembina and Georgian Bay branches. I have already dealt with the remainder of the statute. There is therefore not only nothing in the statute which could by any possibility be taken to include in the words \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" paragraph 14 branches, but on the contrary the clearest exclusion of such branches by the deliberate use of the definition employed in paragraph 1 of the contract in sections 4 and 5 and in section 6 by reference. I would therefore affirm the judgment below on this point.\nThe further question in this appeal may be shortly stated as to whether the exemption provided for by paragraph 16 of the contract extends to \"business\" taxes as provided for by the Saskatchewan statutes set out in the case. The argument proceeded on the basis that it was sufficient for the purposes of this question to consider the provisions of the Cities Act, c. 43 of the statutes of 1947.\nThe statute provides by section 441 that the assessor shall each year assess (1) the owner or occupant \"in respect to every parcel of land\" in the city, with certain exceptions, and (2) ever person \"who is engaged in \u2026 business.\" \"Business\", which is defined by paragraph 4 of section 2 as including any trade, profession, calling, occupation or employment, is to be assessed as provided by section 443. Under that section the assessor shall fix a rate per square foot of the floor space of each building or part thereof used for business purposes, and a different rate may be fixed for different classes of business. It must not, however, exceed the statutory limits which appear to run from $4.00 to $15.00 per square foot. It is provided by subsection (5a) of this section that a railway company, whether its property is liable to assessment and taxation or not, shall be liable to assessment and taxation under this section \"in respect of the business carried on as a railway\" and the provisions of the section otherwise are made to apply except that in the case of a railway it is only buildings occupied which may be taken into consideration; (subsection (2)).\nIt is provided by section 479 that, subject to other provisions of the statute, the municipal and school taxes shall be levied upon lands, businesses and special franchises. The last mentioned is dealt with in subsections (7) and (8) of section 443 by which the owner of a special franchise is assessed for 10 per cent of the value of the franchise and is not assessable in respect of business. By section 485 the owner of a building is liable, in addition to taxes levied in respect of the land and buildings, to business tax levied in respect of business carried on therein. By section 495 the council is required to levy annually on the whole rateable property within the municipality. Section 504 deals with the tax roll and by subsection (2) it is provided that this roll shall contain \"(a) the name of every person assessed,\" \"(c) the nature and description of the property in respect of which he is assessed,\" \"(d) the total amount for which he is assessed.\"\nIt is plain in my view that the \"business\" assessment provided for by these taxing provisions is the assessment (and taxation) of a person in respect of land or building occupied by him for the purposes of a business, and that, apart from any question of a statutory hen or charge, such taxation does not differ from that of a person in respect of ownership of land and building. In each case, the liability imposed is with respect to, in the one case, the value of land owned, and in the other, with respect to the value fixed by the statute of land occupied. In nature, therefore, there is no essential difference. In the case of the land tax, the tax is not simply imposed upon and payable out of the land, nor in the case of the business tax is it simply imposed upon and payable out of assets apart from the land employed in carrying on the business. In each case the tax is imposed upon a person in respect of land owned or occupied.\nWith respect to the meaning of \"taxation of property\" as distinguished from \"taxation of persons in respect of property\", Rand J. said, in Municipal District of Sugar City v. Bennett and White 9, that\nto \"tax property\" is to subject it, as a legal object, to some sort of inhering obligation vaguely to be regarded as the equivalent of a lien is, I think, a misconception \u2026 Except as it may be evidential of an employed means of collection, the conception of the assessment, per se, as of property or of a person in relation to property, carries no practical significance of difference. In Provincial Treasurer vs. Kerr 10, Lord Thankerton said at page 718:\nGenerally speaking, taxation is imposed on persons, the nature and amount of the liability being determined either by individual units, as in the case of a poll tax, or in respect of the taxpayers' interests in property, or in respect of transactions or actings of the taxpayers. It is at least unusual to find a tax imposed on property and not on persons \u2026\nIn the present instance, the tax here in question is imposed on persons in respect of their interest in property, not as a matter of title but as a matter of use.\nIn City of Halifax vs. Fairbanks 11, the respondent owned premises which it let to the Crown for use as a ticket office, the lessee agreeing to pay the \"business tax.\" The city assessed the respondent for business tax under provincial legislation which imposed a \"business tax\" to be paid by every occupier of real property for the purposes of any trade. The statute also provided that any property let to a person exempt from taxation was to be deemed, for business purposes, to be in the occupation of the owner and to be assessed for business tax according to the purposes for which it was occupied. The city was authorized under the legislation to levy the business tax, a household tax and a real property tax. The business tax was assessed on 50 per cent of the capital value of the property occupied for purposes of the business. The household tax was payable by every occupier of real property for residential purposes, and was assessed on 10 per cent of the capital value of such property. The real property tax was a tax on the owners of all real property and was assessed on the capital value. The actual question for decision in the case was as to whether or not the business tax was or was not a direct tax within the meaning of section 92 of the British North America Act. While that was the actual question for decision, their Lordships had to consider the nature of the tax. After pointing out that the framers of the British North America Act had drafted that statute on the basis of a well-known distinction at that time between direct and indirect taxes, Viscount Cave, L.C., said at page 124:\nThus, taxes on property or income were everywhere treated as direct taxes; \u2026 When, therefore, the Act of Union allocated the power of direct taxation for Provincial purposes to the Province, it must surely have intended that the taxation, for those purposes, of property and income should belong exclusively to the Provincial legislatures \u2026 Their Lordships decided that the tax in question was a tax on property and a direct tax.\nUnder the provisions of paragraph 16 of the contract here in question, the stations, station grounds, workshops and buildings required for the working of the railway were to be \"forever free from taxation.\" It would be an extraordinary result if the proper interpretation of this exemption were to be said to be that while taxes imposed upon the owner in respect of his ownership of these things fall within the exemption, nevertheless taxes imposed upon the owner in respect of his use of the same items do not. I do not think the intention of the contracting parties to be derived from the language which they have employed involves any such result and I think application of the business tax here in question to the \"Canadian Pacific Railway\" as I have already interpreted those words is precluded by the terms of paragraph 16, made binding upon the province by section 24 of 4-5 Edward VII, c. 42, Canada.\nI do not think it useful to refer to dicta in earlier cases in this court. In none of them was there involved the question here under consideration. We were also referred to decisions with respect to \"business tax\" in the provincial courts, for instance, Re Hydro Electric Commission and the City of Hamilton 12. By virtue of George V, c. 20, sec. 39, which enacted section 45(a) of the Assessment Act, certain property of the Commission (assuming the statute applied to the particular Commission there in question) was to be exempt from assessment and taxation and it was argued that inasmuch as the business tax imposed by the Act must be paid out of the property, the Commission was exempt from business tax. The Ontario Assessment Act provided for assessment and taxation of land and also for business assessment and taxation. In the course of his judgment 13, the Chief Justice said at page 160:\nThe business assessment is imposed by section 10 and is a personal tax, and not a tax on real or personal property. The assessment on land is used only for the purpose of determining the amount of business assessment, which is a percentage on the assessed value of the land occupied or used for the purpose of the business.\nThe business tax under the statute did not constitute a lien on the land as was the case with the real property tax, and in that sense it was not a tax \"on\" land. Both, however, constituted taxes on persons with respect to their ownership or occupation of land and under the contract in question on this appeal both are within the intendment of the language employed in paragraph 16. As stated by Beck J. as he then was in Hedley Shaw vs. Medicine Hat 14:\nThe \"business assessment\" \u2026 is in effect an assessment of \"the buildings or land or both\" in or on which the business is carried on.\nIn re Ford 15 Middleton J.A. at 411 said with reference to business assessment under the Ontario statute:\n\u2026 in lieu of the assessment of personal property, there was substituted a business assessment fundamentally based upon the value of the land actually occupied in connection with the business which forms the subject matter of the assessment.\nIt is nothing less than the assessment of a person with respect to land occupied by him. The assessment and the tax which follows are in essence the same, whether the assessment is the full capital value of the land as in the case of \"land tax\" or a percentage of that value as in the case of business and household assessment in the city of Halifax and business assessment under the Ontario statute, or whether the assessment is a value of the land fixed by statute as in the case of the Saskatchewan legislation.\nThe decision in Moose Jaw vs. B.A. Oil Co. 16 is largely based on the passage quoted from the judgment in Hydro Electric v. Hamilton ubi cit., and for the reasons already given I do not think it can apply here.\nI adopt the answers given by my brother Locke, and would allow the appellant one-half of its costs in this Court.\nEstey J. (dissenting in part): This is an appeal from the answers given by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 17 to four questions submitted to it under the Constitutional Questions Act of that Province (R.S.S. 1940, c. 72).\nQuestions one and three ask: Does clause 16 of the contract dated October 21, 1880, for the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, exempt and free from taxation the branch lines constructed pursuant to clause 14 of the said contract, and the stations, the station grounds, workshops, buildings, yards and other property used for the working of those branch lines? Questions two and four ask: Does clause 16 of the said contract exempt and free the Canadian Pacific Railway from taxation in respect to the business carried on by the Railway in Saskatchewan?\nClause 16 of the contract reads:\n16. The Canadian Pacific Railway, and all stations and station grounds, workshops, buildings, yards and other property, rolling stock and appurtenances required and used for the construction and working thereof, and the capital stock of the Company, shall be forever free from taxation by the Dominion or by any Province hereafter to be established, or by any Municipal Corporation therein; and the lands of the Company, in the North-West Territories, until they are either sold or occupied, shall also be free from such taxation for twenty years after the grant thereof from the Crown.\nThe Statute (1905 S. of C., 4-5, Edw. VII, c. 42) creating the Province of Saskatchewan provided in sec. 24 thereof:\n24. The powers hereby granted to the said province shall be exercised subject to the provisions of section 16 of the contract set forth in the schedule to Chapter 1 of the Statutes of 1881 being an Act respecting the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\nThese questions arise by virtue of amendments made by the Legislature of that Province to its municipal acts in 1948. These are: the City Act (R.S.S. 1947, c. 43), the Town Act (R.S.S. 1947, c. 44), the Village Act (R.S.S. 1946, c. 31), the Rural Municipality Act (R.S.S. 1946, c. 32) and the Local Improvement Districts Act (R.S.S. 1946, c. 33). The issues have been presented on the basis that these 1948 amendments are all to the same effect and, therefore, reference will be made only to the provisions of the City Act.\nThe aforementioned contract of October 21, 1880, was made a schedule to and approved and ratified by a Statute of the Dominion of Canada (1881 S. of C, 44 Vict., c. 1). The terms of incorporation were made a schedule to this contract and later the Canadian Pacific Railway was incorporated by letters patent dated February 16, 1881, in terms identical with those made a schedule to the contract.\nThe preamble to the foregoing Statute (1881 S. of C. 1) approving the construction contract recited, inter alia, the obligation of the Dominion to construct a railway connecting the seaboard of British Columbia with the railway system of Canada, the efforts made to obtain the con- struction of that railway, and that certain portions thereof had already been constructed by the Dominion Government. It also pointed out the necessity for the development of the Northwest Territories.\nThe contract divided the main line into four sections: Eastern, Lake Superior, Central and Western. It provided that the Company would construct the Eastern and Central sections and that the Government would transfer the completed Lake Superior and Western sections to the Company, which would equip, maintain and efficiently operate the entire railway.\nClause 1 of the contract sets out certain definitions. The answers to questions one and three depend largely upon the construction of the words \"and that the words 'the Canadian Pacific Railway' are intended to mean the entire railway as described in the Act 37th Vict., cap. 14\" as they appear in that clause.\n1. For the better interpretation of this contract, it is hereby declared that the portion of Railway hereinafter called the Eastern section, shall comprise that part of the Canadian Pacific Railway to be constructed, extending from the Western terminus of the Canada Central Railway, near the East end of Lake Nipissing, known as Callander Station, to a point of junction with that portion of the said Canadian Pacific Railway now in course of construction extending from Lake Superior to Selkirk on the East side of Red River; which latter portion is hereinafter called the Lake Superior section. That the portion of said Railway, now partially in course of construction, extending from Selkirk to Kamloops, is hereinafter called the Central section; and the portion of said Railway now in course of construction, extending from Kamloops to Port Moody, is hereinafter called the Western section. And that the words \"the Canadian Pacific, Railway,\" are intended to mean the entire Railway, as described in the Act 37th Victoria, cap. 14. The individual parties hereto, are hereinafter described as the Company; and the Government of Canada is hereinafter called the Government.\nThe appellant contends that the definition of \"Canadian Pacific Railway\" in clause 1 is for the purpose of that clause only and that in clause 16 the words \"Canadian Pacific Railway\" include the main line and the branch lines constructed under clause 14 of the contract, and the property specified in clause 16. The respondent contends, to the contrary, that the definition set forth in clause 1 of \"Canadian Pacific Railway\" applies generally throughout the contract and in particular to clause 16 and, therefore, the exemption is restricted, so far as the Province of Saskatchewan is concerned, to the main line and the property specified in that clause.\nThe opening words of clause 1, \"for the better interpretation of the contract,\" disclose that the purpose and intent of clause 1 is to provide such definitions as may assist in the interpretation of the contract. The four sections, Eastern, Superior, Central and Western, of the main line are first defined. Then follows the sentence \"and that the words 'the Canadian Pacific Railway' are intended to mean the entire railway as described in the Act 37th Vict., cap. 14.\" This sentence indicates that \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" did not mean merely the four sections defined and constituting the main line, but in addition thereto the three branch lines defined in the Act of 1874 and, the amendment thereof in 1879 described as the Georgian Bay, Pembina and Winnipeg branch lines. Then follows the definitions of the words \"Company\" and \"Government.\" Counsel for the appellant emphasized that the word \"hereinafter\" does not appear in relation to \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" while it does appear with regard to every other term defined in that paragraph. Under other circumstances such might be significant, but in this particular case the phrase is used twice prior to this definition in clause 1 and, while this definition is not essential to clarify the meaning of the phrase as used in that clause, it was a circumstance sufficient to justify the draftsman's omission of the word \"hereinafter\" in this instance. The conclusion seems unavoidable that the parties intended that the definitions in clause 1 should obtain generally throughout the contract and that the phrase \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" as in that clause defined includes the main line and the three branches, Georgian Bay, Pembina and Winnipeg (hereinafter referred to as the \"specified branches\"). Moreover, this conclusion finds support when the contract is read as a whole.\nIn the Act of 1874 only the main line and the three specified branches were provided for. There was no provision for the construction of branch lines such as that contained in clause 14 of the 1880 contract. Clause 14 reads as follows:\n14. The Company shall have the right from time to time to lay out, construct, equip, maintain, and work branch lines of railway from any point or points along their main line of railway to any point or points within the territory of the Dominion. Provided always, that before commencing any branch they shall first deposit a map and plan of such branch in the Department of Railways. And the Government shall grant to the Company the lands required for the road bed of such branches, and for the stations, station grounds, buildings, workshops, yards and other appurtenances requisite for the efficient construction and working of such branches, in so far as such lands are vested in the Government.\nUnder the contract of 1880 the railway envisaged may be divided into three parts: the four sections constituting the main line, the three specified branches, the construction of both of these being obligatory under the contract, and as to the third, or the branch lines under clause 14, the contract created no obligation but granted to the Company the privilege of constructing these from time to time as it might decide.\nThe Winnipeg branch provided for in the 1879 amendment was never completed and the part thereof constructed by the Government was transferred to the Company and included in the main line when its route in the Winnipeg area was changed. The Pembina branch was completed by the Government and turned over to the Company, but the Georgian Bay branch was never constructed. I do not think, however, that any conclusion can be drawn from the fact that these changes were made. The Statutes and Orders-in-Council passed between 1874 and 1880 clearly disclose that the actual location of the main line was changed from time to time. When this contract was executed in 1880 it seems clear that the parties had in mind the Dominion Government's obligation with the Province of British Columbia to construct a railway and the development of the prairies; but the route of the railway had been only tentatively arrived at. In fact under clause 13 of the contract, the Company had the right, subject to the approval of the Governor-in-Council, to determine the exact location of the line within the two sections it was building and the Government itself made changes in the sections which it constructed. All this but emphasizes the fact that no conclusion can be drawn from the fact that changes were made with regard to the specified branch lines adverse to the respondent's contention in respect to the meaning of \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" where it appears in clause 1. It is significant that branch lines, apart from those included in the reference to the Act of 1874, are referred to only in clauses 11 and 14. In the former the reference is not of any assistance in determining the answers to the questions here submitted, as it merely indicates the locations in which the Company may select in substitution for those sections of land contained in the twenty-five million acres which \"consist, in a material degree, of land not fairly fit for settlement.\"\nWhile the Government granted to the Company land for the stations, station grounds, etc., on both the main and branch lines, provisions therefor were made in separate clauses: that for the former in clause 10, and the latter in clause 14. Clause 14 imposes no obligation upon the Company to construct these branch lines. It merely gives to the Company the privilege of constructing them as and when it may decide to do so. The consideration of land and money and the transfer of the Lake Superior and the Winnipeg sections when constructed had, under the terms of the contract, no relation to the branch lines referred to in clause 14 and imposed no obligation on the Company to construct them.\nIn clause 7, when the parties intended to refer to the railway and the specified branches, they spoke of \"the Canadian Pacific Railway,\" but when referring to those parts to be constructed and transferred to the Company the terms \"several portions of\" or \"those portions of\" preceded the words \"the Canadian Pacific Railway.\" Then again in clause 8 the parties provided that when the Government transferred \"the respective portions of the Canadian Pacific Railway\" the Company should equip, maintain and operate same. In these clauses when the parties used the phrase \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" they intended it as defined in clause 1.\nThe parties, in clause 9, are providing for the payment and transfer to the Company of the subsidies as the construction on the part of the Company progressed. It is clear that the consideration of money and land in this contract has no reference to the actual work of constructing the branch lines provided for in clause 14 and these branch lines are not included in this clause under the words \"the Canadian Pacific Railway.\" The context makes it clear that the parties in the phrase \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" are referring to that portion to be constructed by the Company. A general definition in a contract such as that which appears in clause 1 is always subject to the implication that it applies only where the context does not otherwise indicate.\nThere may be some ambiguity with respect to this phrase \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" in clause 15. It may well be that the parties here intended the phrase to mean the main line. If that be the construction, it is again on the basis that the context leads to that conclusion, but here again it cannot be suggested that the branch lines under clause 14 are included in the phrase \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" as used in this clause.\nClause 17 authorized the issue by the Company of land grant bonds and when issued one-fifth shall be deposited with the Government\nas security for the due performance of the present contract in respect of the maintenance and continuous working of the railway by the company, as herein agreed, for ten years after the completion thereof \u2026 And as to the said one-fifth of the said bonds, so long as no default shall occur in the maintenance and working of the said Canadian Pacific Railway\n\u2026\nIt is as defined in clause 1 that the phrase \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" is here used. It includes the \"maintenance and continuous working\" thereof but not of the branch lines as constructed under clause 14.\nClause 22 makes applicable the Railway Act of 1879 to \"the undertaking referred to in this contract,\" and then goes on to provide that the said Act shall apply to \"the Canadian Pacific Railway,\" except where the provisions of this contract, or the Act of Incorporation, show a contrary intention. The parties, in this clause, have in mind both \"the undertaking referred to in this contract\" and the provisions of sec. 17 of the letters patent incorporating the Canadian Pacific Railway. The use of the phrase in this last clause no doubt refers to the railway as it may be eventually constructed, but it is abundantly clear that in this clause \"the undertaking referred to in this contract\" is, in the contemplation of the parties, quite a different entity from \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" as it may ultimately be constructed. Sec. 15 of the Terms of Incorporation provides:\nand the said main line of railway, and the said branch lines of railway, shall be commenced and completed as provided by the said contract; and together with such other branch lines as shall be hereafter constructed by the said Company, and any extension of said main line of railway that shall hereafter be constructed or required by the Company, shall constitute the line of railway hereinafter called \"The Canadian Pacific Railway.\"\nThe Terms of Incorporation were made a schedule to the contract and, therefore, these documents must be read together. The language adopted in the foregoing sec. 15 further indicates that the parties contemplated the branch lines constructed under clause 14 a separate and distinct entity from the main line and specified branch lines and where they were intended to be included they were expressly mentioned.\nIn clause 1 the words \"Company\" and \"Government\" are defined and as such used throughout the contract. These words and the terms \"Eastern,\" \"Lake Superior,\" \"Central\" and \"Western\" sections are all used throughout the contract as defined in clause 1. The terms of the clause do not suggest any exception with respect to the definition of \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" apart from the omission of the word \"hereinafter\" already discussed and which is not of sufficient significance to offset the purpose and intent of the clause as expressed in the opening words thereof.\nMoreover, the paragraphs above mentiond and discussed support the view that the parties intended throughout that the words \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" should be construed, unless the context otherwise indicates, as defined in clause 1.\nThe first words in clause 16 are \"The Canadian Pacific Railway.\" This phrase does not refer to the Company as incorporated by letters patent in the following February. In clause 1 it is provided: \"The individual parties hereto are hereinafter described as the Company\" and throughout the contract this word is used as so defined, except where, as in clause 17, the context indicates a different meaning. Moreover, in clause 16 the items specified are restricted to those \"required and used for the construction and making thereof.\" The word \"thereof\" refers back to \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" and as such refers to the physical property. This conclusion is supported by the manner in which these words are used throughout the contract. In clause 17 reference is made to \"the maintenance and working of said Canadian Pacific Railway.\" In clause 7: \"The Canadian Pacific Railway shall become and be thereafter the absolute property of the Company.\" In clause 9: \"The construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway.\" It is the physical property of the lines in respect to which the parties had obligated themselves to construct under the contract that is included in the meaning of this phrase generally throughout the contract. This construction is in accord with the meaning as defined in clause 1 and there is nothing in the context of clause 16 to indicate any other or different meaning. It was contended that the word \"all\" in the phrase \"all stations and station grounds\" in clause 16 indicates that stations etc. both of the main and branch lines constructed under clause 14 were to be exempt. This contention overlooks that it is \"all stations \u2026 required and used for the construction and working thereof.\" This latter word \"thereof\" refers back to \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" in the first line. In these circumstances the submission that in clause 16 the phrase \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" should include not only the main line and the specified branches but also the branch lines to be at some future time constructed by the Company under the privilege granted in clause 14 is to attribute an intention to the parties which, having regard to the other provisions, they would have expressed in either language which is clear and definite or such as, by necessary implication, would include these branch lines constructed under clause 14.\nAppellant then submits that the similarity of the language in clauses 14 and 16, as well as the fact that clause 16 follows so immediately thereafter, discloses an intention on the part of the contracting parties to exempt the branch lines constructed under clause 14. The respective clauses of the contract should be read together, in this sense, that any conflict should, so far as construction of the language may permit, be avoided. Here, however, the language of clause 16 presents no ambiguity, once the meaning of \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" is determined, and so construed it is not in conflict with any provision in clause 14. Moreover, in regard to the construction of the branch lines under clause 14, the Government made no contribution, either of money or of lands, corresponding to the twenty-five million dollars and the twenty-five million acres of land as specified in the contract. The branch lines under clause 14 were a matter separate and apart from the main line and the specified branches and when clause 16 is read and construed in the light of this general intention and the specific clauses already mentioned it is clear that branch lines were not intended to be included under the exemption therein provided for. It is true, as the appellant contends, that the Government intended to encourage the construction of branch lines, but only to the extent provided for in clause 14.\nI am, therefore, in agreement with the learned judges in the Court of Appeal 18 that the exemption in clause 16 does not apply to the branch lines constructed under clause 14. I would, however, vary the answers to questions one and three as stated by my brother Locke.\nThen referring to questions two and four, these ask if the Canadian Pacific Railway, by virtue of the above-quoted clause 16, is exempt from the business tax authorized by the amendments to the aforementioned municipal Acts.\nBusiness is defined \"to include any trade, profession, calling, occupation or employment,\" City Act, sec. 2(4). Sec. 443(1) of that Act provides that the business tax shall be computed at\na rate per square foot of the floor space \u2026 used for business purposes, and shall as far as he deems practicable classify the various businesses and portions thereof.\nThen sec. 443(5a) deals specifically with the railway and provides as follows:\n(5a) A railway company, whether its property is liable to assessment and taxation or not, shall be liable to assessment and taxation under this section in respect of the business carried on as a railway and the provisions of this section, except subsection (2), shall apply.\nThis is a familiar type of tax, in its nature and character distinct from other taxes. It is not imposed upon particular items of property, real or personal, and is not dependent upon ownership or interest in either the premises or the chattels thereon. It is not a tax upon occupation. A person may occupy the premises and be in possession of the chattels thereon, but neither would provide a basis for the assessment of this business tax. The essential without which such a tax cannot be imposed is that a business is conducted upon the premises.\nSir George Jessel M.R. defined business:\nAnything which occupies the time and attention and labour of a man for the purpose of profit is business. It is a word of extensive use and indefinite significance.\nSmith v. Anderson 19.\nRowlatt J., in Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Marine Steam Turbine Co.20, after pointing out that the word \"business\" may have a very wide meaning and that \"in whatever sense it be understood is undoubtedly an elastic word capable of wide extension,\" stated:\nThe word \"business,\" however, is also used \u2026 as meaning an active occupation or profession continuously carried on, and it is in this sense that the word is used in the Act with which we are here concerned.\nThe business of the Company is its activity or undertaking. In the main that of the appellant is the provision and selling of services and facilities for transportation of passengers and goods. The time and ability of its officers, agents and servants are directed to the provision and selling of these services and facilities and it is that activity or undertaking that constitutes the business of the Company. The business tax here provided for is imposed upon that activity or undertaking.\nThis being the nature and character of the tax, the question arises: Is it within the ambit of the exemption in clause 16? The phrase \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" in that clause, as already defined, includes the main and specified branch lines. These, together with the other property \"used for the construction and working thereof,\" constitute that which \"shall be forever free from taxation.\" In this clause the word \"thereof\" refers to the phrase \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" in the first line of the clause and, therefore, to the physical property of the main and specified branch lines and the phrase \"used for the construction and working thereof\" determines the quantum of the property included under the exemption. It is the taxation of the physical property specified in clause 16 that is exempted by the provisions of that clause. That all or any part of this as well as other property would be used in the course of its business does not extend the scope of the exemption. The business of the Company is distinct from the physical property and its separate significance is in no way destroyed by the use of the specified or any other property in the course thereof.\nIn 1880 taxes were generally spoken of as property or personal taxes. The former included taxation of real and personal property and the latter income and poll taxes. Our attention was drawn to the fact, in the course of the hearing, that at that time both British Columbia and Ontario imposed income taxes. It may be assumed that the business tax as here assessed was not in the contemplation of the parties. They would be cognizant of all of the foregoing taxes and of the efforts of even that day to find new sources of revenue. It was in 1875 that the Legislature of Quebec enacted what was construed as, in effect, a stamp tax upon policies of insurance. The Attorney-General for Quebec v. The Queen Insurance Company 21.\nIn these circumstances, if the parties had intended that more than a tax upon the physical property should be exempted, they would have, adopted language expressive of that intention. On the contrary the parties, in the language they have chosen, have expressed their intention in terms not sufficiently wide and comprehensive to include a business tax such as provided for in the municipal legislation here under review. It is unnecessary here to discuss whether a business tax is a property or a personal tax, as in either event the language in clause 16 does not include it in the scope of the exemption therein provided for.\nIn Canadian Northern Pacific Railway Company v. Corporation of New Westminster22, the Privy Council, in construing the word \"railway\" as it appears in the British Columbia Railway Act 1911, c. 44 sec. 2, differentiated between the physical property and the whole undertaking of the Company. In the course of the judgment it was stated:\nThe things so brought by definition into the term \"railway\" are all physical things, as the railway itself is. The definition does not bring into \"railway\" the whole \"undertaking\" of the company \u2026 It is used in the clause as denoting a physical thing, of which something else can form part and which can be \"operated.\"\nA similar distinction between the physical property and the business of the Company is apparent in the language of clause 16.\nThe fact that the tax is computed on the floor space does not necessarily affect the character of the tax. In Smith v. Council of the Rural Municipality of Vermillion Hills 23, the fact that a tax was imposed of so many cents per acre did not make it a land tax or affect its true nature and character as a tax upon the occupant. Moreover, in City of Montreal v. The Attorney-General for Canada 24, the fact that the tax was computed upon the basis of 1 per cent on the capitalized value of the property did not destroy the nature and character of the tax as one imposed upon the occupant.\nWhile, therefore, the computation of a tax may well be taken into consideration in determining its true nature and character, it is not conclusive. The problem in City of Halifax v. Fairbanks Estate 25 was quite different from that at bar. It does, however, illustrate the basis for and the nature and character of the business tax. There the owner was made liable by statute for a business tax, though he was not in possession of the premises and did not conduct the business. In my opinion, the Legislature of Saskatchewan imposed a tax here upon the business which is not included in the terms of the exemption provided for in clause 16.\nWhile question No. 2 suggests three bases for the exemption of the business tax and the Legislature adopts but the first, there is no difference in principle involved and I think the answer should be the same with respect to all the three divisions.\nQuestions 1 and 3 should be answered as stated by my brother Locke. Question 2 should be answered \"No\" and question 4 \"Yes.\"\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs. The judgment of Locke and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by:\nLocke J.:\u2014The answer to be made to the first question depends upon the meaning to be assigned to the words \"Canadian Pacific Railway\" in clause 16 of the contract entered into between the Crown and George Stephen and his associates dated October 21, 1880, the terms of which were approved and ratifid by c. 1, Statutes of Canada, 1881. That clause reads:\n16. The Canadian Pacific Railway, and all stations and station grounds, work shops, buildings, yards and other property, rolling stock and appurtenances required and used for the construction and working thereof, and the capital stock of the Company shall be forever free from taxation by the Dominion, or by any Province hereafter to be established or by any Municipal Corporation therein, and the lands of the Company, in the North-West Territories, until they are either sold or occupied, shall also be free from such taxation for 20 years after the grant thereof from the Crown.\nBy clause 14 of the contract it was provided that the Company should have the right to build branch lines of railway from any point along the main line to any point within the territory of the Dominion and it is contended on its behalf that branch lines built under this authority in what is now the Province of Saskatchewan are included in the expression \"Canadian Pacific Railway\" and as such entitled to the exemption provided by clause 16. The contention of the Attorney-General is that the exemption is restricted to the railway described in an Act to Provide for the Construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, c. 14, Statutes of Canada, 1874.\nClause 1 of the contract reads:\n1. For the better interpretation of this contract, it is hereby declared that the portion of Railway hereinafter called the Eastern section, shall comprise that part of the Canadian Pacific Railway to be constructed, extending from the Western terminus of the Canada Central Railway, near the East end of Lake Nipissing, known as Callander Station, to a point of junction with that portion of the said Canadian Pacific Railway now in course of construction extending from Lake Superior to Selkirk on the East side of Red River; which latter portion is hereinafter called the Lake Superior section. That the portion of said Railway, now partially in course of construction, extending from Selkirk to Kamloops, is hereinafter called the Central section; and the portion of said Railway now in course of construction, extending from Kamloops to Port Moody, is hereinafter called the Western section. And that the words \"the Canadian Pacific Railway,\" are intended to mean the entire Railway, as described in the Act 37th Victoria, cap. 14. The individual parties hereto, are hereinafter described as the Company; and the Government of Canada is hereinafter called the Government.\nBy the Terms of Union under which the Colony of British Columbia entered Confederation the Government of Canada undertook to secure the commencement within two years from the date of Union of the construction of a railway from the Pacific towards the Rocky Mountains, and from such point as might be selected east of those Mountains towards the Pacific to connect the seaboard of British Columbia with the railway system of Canada. The statute of 1874, after reciting this term of the arrangement in the preamble, enacted that a railway to be called the \"Canadian Pacific Railway\" should be made from a point near to and south of Lake Nipissing to some point in British Columbia on the Pacific Ocean, both of such points to be determined and the course and line of the railway to be approved of by the Governor in Council. The terms in which the proposed railway were described and the references made to the branch railways are of importance. They read:\n2. The whole line of the said railway, for the purpose of its construction, shall be divided into four sections;\u2014the first section to begin at a point near to and south of Lake Nipissing, and to extend towards the upper or western end of Lake Superior, to a point where it shall intersect the second section hereinafter mentioned; the second section to begin at some point on Lake Superior, to be determined by the Governor in Council, and connecting with the first section, and to extend to Red River, in the Province of Manitoba; the third section to extend from Red River, in the Province of Manitoba, to some point between Fort Edmonton and the foot of the Rocky Mountains, to be determined by the Governor in Council; the fourth section to extend from the western terminus of the third section to some point in British Columbia on the Pacific Ocean.\n3. Branches of the said railway shall also be constructed as follows, that is to say :\u2014\nFirst\u2014A branch from the point indicated as the proposed eastern terminus of the said railway to some point on the Georgian Bay, both the said points to be determined by the Governor in Council.\nSecondly\u2014A branch from the main line near Fort Garry, in the Province of Manitoba, to some point near Pembina on the southern boundary thereof.\n4. The branch railways above mentioned shall, for all intents and purposes, be considered as forming part of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and as so many distinct sections of the said railway, and shall be subject to all the provisions hereinafter made with respect to the said Canadian Pacific Railway, except in so far as it may be otherwise provided for by this Act.\nIn the interval between the passing of this Act and the date of the contract various efforts were made by the Government of Canada to arrange for the construction of the proposed railway by private interests and all had proved abortive. The Government had meanwhile proceeded with the work of construction on what was referred to in the statute of 1874 as the second section, some work had been done in British Columbia, the branch from Emerson to Fort Garry (referred to in the proceedings as the Pembina Branch) had been built and a start had been made on the line from Winnipeg West. In addition, surveys had been made and various decisions made regarding the route of the line for the Western section. By c. 14 of the Statutes of 1879 the Canadian Pacific Railway Act of 1874. was amended by providing that a branch of the railway should be constructed from some point west of the Red River on that part of the main line running south of Lake Manitoba to the City of Winnipeg, there to connect with the Pembina Branch, and providing that all the provisions of the Act of 1874 with respect to branches of the railway should apply to the branch to be constructed. It was contemplated at this time that the main line of the road would cross the Red River at East Selkirk, proceeding from there in a general westerly and north-westerly direction to Fort Edmonton and thence down through the Yellow Head Pass to Kamloops and thence to the Pacific Coast. The line from Selkirk westerly, however, was not proceeded with, it being decided that instead of proceeding through Stonewall and the country immediately south of Lake Manitoba and thence west the main line should follow the line of settlement further to the south, crossing the Red River at Winnipeg and proceeding westerly a short distance to the north of the Assiniboine River through Portage la Prairie and thence west. The Act of 1874 required the approval of the Governor in Council to the exact site of the proposed line throughout its course and in advance of the date of the contract it had been decided that the Pacific Terminus of the railway should be a point on Burrard Inlet. The decision, however, to alter the course of the line by proceeding through the Kicking Horse Pass instead of the Yellow Head Pass had not been made until after the contract was made. The construction which preceded the contract was of part of the railway and branches described generally in the statute and the lines so partially completed were ultimately conveyed to the Company.\nFor the appellant it is urged that the third sentence of clause 1 above quoted is not intended to define the expression \"Canadian Pacific Railway\" in any part of the contract other than that clause. I find difficulty in appreciating the force of this argument. Clause 1 is designed to define certain terms and sentences 1 and 2 define the Eastern, Lake Superior, Central and Western sections, all of which are thereafter referred to by these designations in the succeeding paragraphs. The first sentence refers to \"that part of the Canadian Pacific Railway to be constructed\", and again to a point of junction with \"that portion of the said Canadian Pacific Railway now in course of construction\", and the meaning of the expression there can only be the railway the construction of which is thereafter provided for in the contract. In the second sentence it refers to \"the portion of said railway\" referring back to the Canadian Pacific Railway to be constructed mentioned in the preceding sentence. There appears then to have been no necessity for defining the words \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" in the construction of the first two sentences and the preliminary words of the third sentence indicate to me that it is intended to be read in conjunction with the opening words of the first sentence. The matter would be more clear if, instead of the second sentence ending after the words \"Western section\", it had continued to the last words of the third sentence, the period after the word \"section\" being replaced with a comma. I think, however, the first three sentences are to be interpreted as if they read:\nFor the better interpretation of this contract it is hereby declared that (the various sections of the railway should be as defined) and that the words \"the Canadian Pacific Railway\" are intended to mean the entire railway as described in the Act 37 Vict. cap. 14. Unless this is the true construction, I cannot understand why the third sentence was included in the clause. While the argument of the appellant is that the remainder of the contract indicates that this was not intended, I have come to a different conclusion.\nClause 3 contains the first of the obligations assumed by Stephen et al (described for the purpose of the contract in the last sentence of clause 1 as the company) as to the construction of the road and by that clause they agreed to construct and equip the Eastern section and the Central section, using the designations applied to these respective parts of the line in clause 1 and by clause 4 the times at which this work should be commenced and completed are stated.\nClause 7 declares that the railway constructed under the terms of the agreement shall be the property of the Company and that pending the completion of the Eastern and Central sections the Government \"shall transfer to the Company the possession and right to work and run the several portions of the Canadian Pacific Railway already constructed or as the same shall be completed,\" and in the succeeding sentence the railway, portions of which had been constructed or were to be constructed by the Government and conveyed to the Company, is referred to as the \"Canadian Pacific Railway.\" Here the expression clearly refers to the portions of the \"entire railway\" referred to in the third sentence of clause 1 which had been or was to be constructed under the terms of the contract. The last sentence of this clause:\nAnd the Company shall thereafter and forever efficiently maintain, work and run the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nis said to indicate that the meaning of \"Canadian Pacific Railway\" cannot be restricted in the manner defined in clause 1, since it cannot have been in contemplation that the obligation to maintain, work and run the road should be restricted to the main line and the branches referred to in the statute of 1874. I do not think that this follows. The advisers of the Government who passed upon the form of the contract may well have considered that when the Company built branch lines under the powers given by clause 14 the obligation to supply facilities for traffic im- posed by section 25(2) of the Consolidated Railway Act, 1879, and the powers vested in the Railway Committee by that statute would suffice to protect the public interest.\nBy clause 8 the Company was required to equip, maintain and efficiently operate the respective portions of the \"Canadian Pacific Railway\" which were to be conveyed to it by the Crown. By its very terms it is manifest that the expression here refers only to the portions of the road constructed or which were to be constructed by the Crown, as required by the contract.\nClause 9 contains the obligation of the Crown to grant a subsidy of money and land \"for which subsidies the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway shall be completed.\" Here the reference is to the road to be constructed in accordance with the contract.\nClause 10 contains the obligation of the Crown to grant to the Company the lands required for the right-of-way, stations, station grounds, workshops, dock ground and water frontage at the termini on navigable waters, buildings, yards, and other appurtenances required for the convenient and effectual construction and working of the railway, in so far as such land shall be vested in the Government. The clause further obligated the Crown to admit free of duty certain rails and other material \"to be used in the original construction of the railway and of a telegraph line in connection therewith.\" The expression \"Canadian Pacific Railway\" does not appear in this clause. However, the railway referred to is that to be constructed under the obligations imposed by the contract partly by the Crown and partly by the Company and not the branch lines which the Company might thereafter undertake, as to which provision for a grant of the right-of-way and other lands required is made by clause 14.\nClause 15 provides that within twenty years from the date of the contract no line of railway shall be authorized by the Dominion Parliament to be constructed south of the \"Canadian Pacific Railway\" from any point at or near the Canadian Pacific Railway, except such line as shall run southwest or to the westward of southwest, nor to within fifteen miles of Latitude 49. The expression here cannot mean the line of railway to be constructed under the terms of the contract plus such branch lines as might thereafter be constructed under the powers contained in clause 14, in my opinion. It was obviously in the contemplation of both parties to the contract that branch lines would be constructed to open up the country to the south of the main line, some of which would extend to the international boundary and connect with railways operating in the United States and such a branch line was built in the course of time from Moose Jaw to North Portal at the boundary. The Canadian terminus of this road being on the international boundary, if the expression \"Canadian Pacific Railway\" included the branch lines, any point \"south of the Canadian Pacific Railway\" would be in the United States. Such a construction would render the clause meaningless.\nIt is by clause 16 that the exemption is provided. It is of importance to note that it is not merely the stations, station grounds, workshops, buildings, yards and other property, rolling stock and appurtenances situate upon the road to be constructed which are exempted but these \"required and used in the construction and working thereof:\" thus round houses or machine shops required in the operation of the line to be constructed under the terms of the contract might well be situate on a branch line constructed under the powers granted by clause 14. I can perceive nothing in clause 16 itself to indicate that the definition contained in the third sentence of clause 1 is not to apply to the expression \"Canadian Pacific Railway.\"\nClause 17 provides for the deposit of certain of the land grant bonds with the Government which the Company was authorized to issue as security for the \"due performance of the present contract in respect of the maintenance and continuous working of the railway by the Company, as herein agreed, for ten years after the completion thereof.\" By the third sentence it was provided as to the bonds so deposited that \"so long as no default shall occur in the maintenance and working of the said Canadian Pacific Railway\" the Government shall not demand payment of the coupons on the bonds. The words here can have no other meaning than the \"railway to be constructed under the contract. If, as contended, it meant the line to be constructed under the contract, plus such lines as the Company might at any time in the future choose to construct under the powers contained in clause 14, the date of the expiration of the ten year period would never be ascertainable.\nGreat stress is laid by the appellant upon the language of section 22 providing that the Railway Act of 1879, in so far as its provisions are applicable to the undertaking referred to in the contract and are not inconsistent with the terms of the agreement or contrary to the provisions of the Act of Incorporation to be granted to the Company, shall apply to the \"Canadian Pacific Railway.\" The expression here, it is said, obviously refers to the entire undertaking including branch lines to be thereafter constructed, since it is inconceivable that the statute would be made applicable to a part of the future railway system. I think, however, that this section is to be interpreted as providing that the Railway Act of 1879, with named exceptions, should apply to the operation of the Railway as defined in clause 1. The matter is similarly expressed in sections 2 and 4 of the Consolidated Railway Act of 1879 referred to in clause 22 which may well have been in this respect patterned upon it. Section 2 provided that sections 5 to 35 \"shall apply to the Intercolonial Railway\" and section 4 says that sections 34 to 98 \"shall apply to the Intercolonial Railway in so far as they are not varied by or inconsistent with the special Act respecting it, to all railways constructed by the Government of Canada and to all railways which have been in or since the said year (1868) or which may be hereafter constructed under the authority of, or made subject to, any special Act passed by the Parliament of Canada and to all companies incorporated for their construction and working.\" The reference to the Intercolonial Railway is to the physical property and to the railways constructed under special Act by corporations both to the physical property and the companies operating them, and while this latter reference was omitted in clause 22 I think the meaning to be no less certain. If the Act was made applicable to the Railway those operating it would be bound to conform to its terms.\nIt is, however, further contended on behalf of the appellant that the definition in clause 1 cannot apply since the railway to be constructed under the terms of the contract was not that contemplated in the Act of 1874. That statute which defined the proposed route of the railway in general terms as being from a point to the south of Lake Nipissing to extend to the upper and western end of Lake Superior, thence to the Red River, thence to some point between Fort Edmonton and the foot of the Rocky-Mountains, and from there to some point in British Columbia on the Pacific Ocean, also provided for the construction of a branch from the point indicated as the proposed Eastern terminus of the railway to some point on Georgian Bay and a branch from the main line near Fort Garry to some point near Pembina on the Southern boundary. This description of the proposed line was of necessity vague since the most desirable route had not then been determined and was accordingly left to be approved by the Governor in Council. When the contract was entered into in 1880 the definition of the proposed Western line contained in section 1 was more specific, though the final route had not then been decided. The line from Fort Garry to Pembina had been built and while I think it is not entirely clear whether the extension from Fort Garry to Selkirk, authorized by the amendment of 1879, was then completed, the report of Sandford Fleming to Sir Charles Tupper of April 8th, 1881, shows the entire line from Selkirk to Emerson as under contract. The definition in the third sentence of clause 1 would thus include the Pembina Branch from Emerson to Fort Garry if the description in the statute of 1874 is taken, and the extension north to Selkirk if what was intended was the Act of 1874, as amended by the Act of 1879. The so-called Georgian Bay Branch, however, it is said, had been abandoned prior to the date of the contract and it is said that this indicates clearly that the description in clause 1 of the contract did not apply. On the assumption that we are entitled to examine the available evidence, I have read the documents filed in support of the contention that the intention to construct the Georgian Bay line had been abandoned prior to the time of the contract and I am not satisfied that this is so. A contract had been let for the line but, with the exception of a comparatively insignificant amount of work done under it, it was not proceeded with and the Crown terminated this contract. That the project itself was abandoned was not, in my opinion, proven.\nIt is further said for the appellant that, if, as contended on its behalf, it is not clear that the phrase \"Canadian Pacific Railway\" in clause 16 applies not only to the line to be built under the terms of the contract but also to the branch lines constructed under the powers contained in clause 14, then extrinsic evidence is admissible to explain the meaning of the term. A large number of documents were by consent filed, reserving to the Attorney-General his right to object to their admissibility. Assuming, but without deciding, that any of the documents filed are admissible as an aid to construction, I have examined all of them and do not find that doing so assists the contention of the appellant. It must be said on this aspect of the matter that perhaps the strongest argument to be made in favour of the appellant's contention is that to one familiar with Western Canada it seems highly improbable that those undertaking to construct this vast railway work the success of which would undoubtedly depend upon the development of the country from a few miles east of the Red River to the foothills of the Rockies, which would of necessity require the construction of numerous branch lines, would have been satisfied with a tax exemption restricted to the main line only and the Pembina and Georgian Bay branches. It would be apparent to anyone familiar with the country to be traversed that very little freight traffic could be expected to originate in the territory lying between Lake Superior and the eastern limit of the Prairies in Manitoba and between the foothills of the Rockies and the Pacific Coast for many years to come. These are matters of common knowledge and, as one would expect, the question of tax exemption was brought up during the early attempts to obtain the construction of the road which Canada had obligated itself to construct under the Terms of Union with British Columbia. Thus in 1872 two companies, the Inter-Oceanic Railway Company of Canada and Canada Pacific Railway Company were incorporated, the private Acts constituting them each containing a provision that the buildings, right-of-way, permanent way, rolling stock and earnings of the company and all its properties, except the lands granted, should be exempt from taxation in any province thereafter to be constituted from the territory of the Dominion for fifty years after the completion of the railway under any law, ordinance, or by-law of any provincial, local or municipal authority. Neither of these companies proceeded with the matter and in a memorandum transmitted by Sir John A. Macdonald to Duncan Maclntyre which, we are told was prepared in the summer of 1880, what was called a confidential project for the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway was submitted which proposed a subsidy of varying amounts per mile of construction from Nipissing to Thunder Bay and from Red River to Kamloops, $20,000,000 in cash and a land grant. Maclntyre on behalf of himself and his associates who included George Stephen and others who finally became parties to the contract, in an undated reply addressed to Sir John, said in part:\nAmong the points not referred to in the memorandum we may mention that of taxation from which we think the proposed line should be free.\nLater, in a document dated September 14th, 1880, produced from the possession of the railway company and called \"Heads of Arrangement\" details of a plan for the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway are set out. While these provided for a subsidy in money of $25,000,000, a land grant of 25 million acres, the admission free of customs duties of certain materials to be used in the construction of the road, no mention is made of any tax exemption. In my opinion, if any inference is to be drawn from these documents, it is that the matter of exempting the undertaking from taxes to be imposed by the Dominion and by any province to be thereafter constituted out of the Northwest Territories, was considered and deliberately limited to that part of the line the construction of which was provided for by the contract and those portions built or to be built by the Crown and conveyed to the Company. It seems to me to be impossible to draw any other inference than that the limitation of the exemption to the line as defined in clause 1 was the real agreement of the parties. In a matter of this moment, I cannot believe that the legal advisers of Stephen et al who passed upon, the contract could have approved it in its present form if the real agreement was that now contended for by the appellant.\nWe are also referred to what is an undoubted fact that in the period between 1880 and 1908 the respective governments of the Northwest Territories and of the Province of Saskatchewan apparently considered that the exemption was of both the main line and the branch lines constructed under clause 14 and made no attempt to impose or authorize the imposition of taxation and that the late Sir Frederick Haultain and the late Mr. Walter Scott were of that opinion. However, neither the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories or the Legislature of Saskatchewan or that Province authorized the contract, nor were they or their respective Governments parties to it and their conduct cannot be relied upon as an aid to construction.\nThe first question cannot, in my opinion, be answered by a simple affirmative or negative. Clause 16 exempts the stations, station grounds, workshops, buildings, yards and other property, rolling stock and appurtenances required and used for the construction and working of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Question 1 asks if the same properties \"used for the working of the branch lines of the Canadian Pacific Railway situated in Saskatchewan\" are exempt. There may well be properties of the description mentioned which are \"required and used for the working\" of the main line which are also used in part for the working of the branch lines constructed under clause 14. This would undoubtedly be so in respect to the rolling stock and may refer to a large number of other properties and works situate upon branch lines of this description. No statement as to this appears in the reference which would enable us to determine what properties are in fact exempt. Having come to the conclusion that the exemption in the Province of Saskatchewan is restricted to the main line and the named branches the answer to be made should be qualified accordingly.\nThe second question submitted is as to whether clause 16 of the contract exempts the Canadian Pacific Railway Company from taxation in Saskatchewan in respect of the business carried on as a railway, based on either the area of the land or the floor space of buildings used, the rental value of the land and buildings used or their assessed value and which is not made a charge upon such land or buildings. By section 24 of the Saskatchewan Act (4-5 Edw. VII, c. 42) which constituted the Province it is provided:\nThe powers hereby granted to the said Province shall be exercised subject to the provisions of section 16 of the contract set forth in the schedule to Chap. 1 of the Statutes of 1881, being an Act respecting the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\nThe language of section 1 of the Act of 1881 is that the contract:\nis hereby approved and ratified and the Government is hereby authorized to perform and carry out the conditions thereof according to their purport.\nThe question is thus not the construction of a provision in a statute but in a contract to which the Province was not a party. The exemption granted by clause 16 is as to the named properties \"required and used for the construction and working\" of the railway. The benefit of that exemption was vested in the Canadian Pacific Railway. Company by section 4 of the letters patent of incorporation and remains in it so long as the company continues to be the owner or operator of the property and uses it for the defined purpose. The position adopted on behalf of the Province of Saskatchewan put bluntly is this: that while neither the physical property defined by clause 1 nor the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in respect of its ownership of that property is liable to taxation, so-called business taxes may be levied upon the Company in respect of its business of operating it. While the language of clause 16 is that the property shall be \"forever free from taxation\" by any province thereafter to be established, it is said that to tax the Company in respect to the use of the property (itself a term of the exemption), is not to tax the property and that that alone is prohibited. The question, as submitted, states that the business tax levied by any of the three methods mentioned will not be made a charge upon the land or buildings. I cannot understand what possible difference this can make. Municipal taxes may be and at times are declared to be a lien upon the property in respect to which they are levied, but this is merely a provision to secure their collection: in determining the nature of this tax, the fact that there is no charge upon the land or buildings in respect of it appears to me irrelevant. By the City Act 1947 the imposition of a business tax was authorized and by amendments made by c. 33 of the Statutes of 1948 this was made to apply to every railway company owning or operating a railway in Saskatchewan (sec. 20 (a)). Section 443 which authorized the imposition of the tax was also amended in that year by the addition of subsection 5(a) Which reads:\nA railway company, whether its property is liable to assessment and taxation or not, shall be liable to assessment and taxation under this section in respect of the business carried on as a railway and the provisions of this section, except subsection (2) shall apply.\nThe case has been argued on the footing that the provisions of this statute, in so far as they affect the taxation of the business of a railway, do not differ in substance from like provisions in the Village Act, 1946, the Rural Municipalities Act, 1946, the Local Improvement District Act, 1946, and the Town Act 1947, all as amended, which are referred to in the fourth question and Questions 2 and 4, may thus be dealt with together.\nThe City Act, by section 2(4), defines the term \"business\" as including any trade, profession, calling, occupation or employment. Part VII of the statute under the heading \"Assessment and Taxation\" provides by section 441 that not later than a named date the assessor shall assess: in respect to every parcel of land in the City, inter alia, the registered owner or the owner under a bona fide agreement for sale. Subsection 2 of section 441 requires the assessor to assess every person engaged in mercantile, professional or any other business in the City, with certain named exceptions. By section 442 the right-of-way of a railway owned by a railway company or occupied by it if owned by others and exempt from taxation is to be assessed at an amount not exceeding $6,000 per mile.\nSection 444 provides that no person who is assessed in respect of a business shall be liable to pay a licence fee to the City in respect of the same business. Section 443 which declares the basis of the assessment for business tax commences:\nBusiness shall be assessed in the following manner:\nThe assessor is directed to fix a rate per square foot of the floor space of each building used for business purposes and if the business is carried on wholly or in part outside of any building a rate per square foot of the yard space used. Subsection 4 directs the entry on the assessment roll of each of the persons who as partners, joint tenants, tenants in common or by any other kind of joint interest are \"the owners or occupants of real property liable to taxation hereunder.\" Section 479 directs that the municipal and' school taxes of the City shall be levied upon (1) lands, (2) businesses, and (3) special franchises. Section 485 provides that the owner of a building who is liable to assessment in respect of business carried on therein shall in addition to his liability for taxes levied in respect of the land and building be liable for the business tax in respect of such business. By section 504, the first of a number of sections which appear under the heading \"Taxes\", the assessor is directed to prepare a tax roll on or before the 1st day of October in each year which shall contain the name of every person assessed and:\n(2) (c) the nature and description of the property in respect of which he is assessed.\nWhile section 479 refers to the tax levies as being upon lands and businesses, this must be read together with other sections of the statute which in terms make it clear that as regards the owner of land the tax is assessed against and levied upon him and not upon the land. As to the business tax, while the opening words of section 443 read that \"business\" is to be assessed, it is the individual carrying on the business upon whom the assessment is made and the tax levied and the true nature of the tax is shown to be a tax in respect of the occupation of property for the purpose of carrying on the business.\nClause 16 of the contract does not grant an absolute exemption of the stations, station grounds, buildings and other property referred to but only such as are used for the construction and working of the railway and, in my opinion, if buildings which fell within the description ceased to be used by the owner or operator of the property for such purposes the exemption would be lost. Since, therefore, it is the buildings, station grounds, yards and other property when used for these purposes which are declared to be forever free from taxation by the Dominion or by any province thereafter to be established, I think it cannot be said that a tax upon the owner in respect of the use of the property for the purpose of working the railway is not squarely within the exemption. To construe the clause otherwise is to say that the properties mentioned are exempt from all taxation when used for the defined purpose, but if they are so used that the owner may be taxed in respect of that use. I am unable to so construe the clause.\nThe third question relates to the liability to assessment and taxation of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in respect of its real estate situate upon its branch lines constructed under the powers contained in clause 14. While the first question as to the branch lines of the railway speaks of these lines generally, we were informed upon the argument that the Company did not contend that properties exempted by clause 16 situate upon branch lines constructed under powers other than those contained in clause 14 were exempt. I think this admission was not intended to extend to properties of the kind referred to situate upon such lands if they were used either for the construction or operation of the main line. The answer to the first question, as thus restricted, answers the third.\nI would answer the questions submitted as folows:\u2014\n1. No, except such properties, if any, real or personal, enumerated in clause 16, situate upon the branch lines in Saskatchewan as are entitled to the benefit of the exemption from taxation as being required and used for the construction and working of the railway described in sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Act 37 Vict. cap. 14.\n2. Yes, as to the business carried on as a railway upon or in connection with the railway as described in sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Act 37 Vict. cap. 14, and upon such other properties, if any, real or personal, of the Company situate upon its branch lines in Saskatchewan as are entitled to the benefit of exemption from taxation under clause 16 as being required and used for the construction and working of that portion of the line referred to in the said sections of the statute.\n3. Yes, except in respect of such real estate, if any, situate upon branch lines constructed pursuant to clause 14 of the contract as is entitled to the benefit of the exemption from taxation under clause 16 as being required and used for the construction and working of the railway as described in sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Act 37 Vict. cap. 14.\n4. (a) No.\n(b) Yes, subject to the limitation stated in the answer to Question 2.\nI would allow the appellant one-half of its costs of this appeal.\nAppeal allowed in part; appellant allowed one-half of its costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hamilton & Knowles.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

Locke, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nSeditious libel\u2014Religious pamphlet distributed by Witness of Jehovah\u2014Seditious intention\u2014Good faith\u2014Whether incitation to violence is necessary element of seditious libel\u2014Whether jury was properly charged\u2014Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, s. 133 (as amended by S. of C. 1936, c. 29, s. 4) and s. 133A (as enacted by S. of C. 1930,, c. 11, s. 2).\nNeither language calculated to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of His Majesty's subjects nor criticizing the courts is seditious unless there is the intention to incite to violence or resistance to or defiance of constituted authority.\nThe definition of a seditious intention given in Stephen's Digest of the Criminal Law, 8th Ed. p. 94, to the extent that it differs from the foregoing, disapproved.\nAppellant was convicted by a jury of having published a seditious libel, by distributing copies of a pamphlet containing alleged seditious passages, to several persons at St. Joseph, in the district of Beauce, in the province of Quebec, contrary to s. 134 of the Criminal Code. The conviction was affirmed by a majority in the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side). An appeal to this Court was allowed on grounds of misdirection and improper rejection of evidence. On the first hearing of this appeal, heard by a Court of five judges, the majority ordered a new trial. Application was then made, and granted, to have the appeal reargued before a full Court of nine judges. On the reargument, it was conceded on behalf of the Crown that the conviction should be quashed due to errors in the trial judge's charge, and the only question which remained was as to whether there was evidence upon which a properly instructed jury could find the appellant guilty of publishing a seditious libel by reason of the publication of the pamphlet here in question.\nHeld: (Reversing the judgment appealed from) the Chief Justice, Taschereau, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. dissenting, that the accused should be acquitted as there was no evidence, either in the pamphlet or otherwise, upon which a jury, properly instructed, could find him guilty of the offence charged.\nPer Rinfret C.J. (dissenting) : Since the Criminal Code has dealt with the matter, the Courts must administer the law respecting seditious libel in accordance with the Canadian legislation and not in accordance with statements by commentators in England. Section 133(4) of the Code makes it clear that the advocating of force is not the only instance in which an accused could be found guilty of a seditious intention. Moreover, it does not belong to this Court to pass upon any other passage of the charge than those referred to in the dissent in the Court of Appeal, nor to decide itself whether there was any ground for coming to the conclusion that the document was or was not a seditious libel. What the jury alone had to decide was: (a) whether the document contained matters which were producing or had a tendency to produce feelings of hatred and ill-will; (b) whether the accused pointed out these matters in order to their removal; and (c) whether he did so in good faith, This Court has no authority to decide these questions, more particularly in view of the fact that the jurisdiction of this 'Court in criminal eases is limited to the points of dissent in the Court of Appeal (which, in this case, were exclusively on the ground that the charge was incomplete and erroneous in certain respects and had exceeded the limitations imposed by the rules of law).\nPer Taschereau, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. (dissenting) : That, although to render an intention to create ill-will and hostility between different classes of His Majesty's subjects seditious there must be an intention to incite resistance to lawfully constituted authority (and this cannot be found to have been the intention here) ; at common law an intention to vilify the administration of justice and bring it into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection against it is a seditious ' intention, the Criminal Code has not altered the law in this respect and as the words of the pamphlet furnish evidence upon which a properly instructed jury could reasonably find the existence of that intention, there should be a new trial.\n(The history of the law relating to a seditious intention considered and the authorities reviewed). APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], dismissing, Letourneau C.JA and Galipeault JA dissenting, appellant's appeal from his conviction, at trial before a jury, on the following charge: \"Que le ou vers le 11 d\u00e9cembre, 1946, h St Joseph dans le district de Beauce, le dit Aim\u00e9 Boucher de Ste Germaine a publi\u00e9 des libelles s\u00e9ditieux contenues dans un fascicule intitul\u00e9 \"La haine ardente du Qu\u00e9bec pour Dieu, pour Christ et pour la libert\u00e9 est un sujet de honte pour tout le Canada\", en les exhibant en public ou les faisant lire ou les montrant ou les d\u00e9livrant, ou les faisant montrer ou d\u00e9livrer dans le but de les faire lire par quel-qu'un, le tout malicieusement et contrairement au code Criminel du Canada, sp\u00e9cialement aux articles 133, 134 et 318.\nThe points of dissent in the Court below, to which this Court was limited in its consideration of this case, were as follows:\n1) That references in the charge to the facts proven in the case appealed more to the religious or national senti\u00adments of the jury than to the latter's reason;\n2) That the trial judge should not have undertaken to establish that some of the statements in the document were erroneous, after he had properly ruled that the truth of the statements was immaterial;\n3) That the trial judge misdirected himself when he told the jury that it ought to find the accused guilty if it thought that the document was of a nature to insinuate that in Quebec the administration of justice was biased, that the clergy controlled the Courts, and that there existed in that Province an apparent hate for God and Christ and Freedom;\n4) That a certain objection to a question put by the defence and of a nature to establish the good faith of the accused should not have been maintained;\n5) That the trial judge misdirected himself when he stated that he could not see where the jury could find that there was a doubt in this case. A. L. Stein K.C., W. G. How and D. B. Spence for appel\u00adlant at the first hearing.\nA. Lacourci\u00e8re K.C. for respondent at the first hearing.\nW. G. How for appellant at the second hearing.\nL. H. Gendron K.C. for respondent at the second hearing.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting): There has been a rehearing in this appeal, but the appellant has failed to convince me that I should modify the reasons for judgment which I had written after the first hearing and which were as follows:\nThe appellant was convicted by a jury of publishing a seditious libel contrary to Section 133 of the Criminal Code and the conviction was affirmed by the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) of the Province of Quebec[2], the Chief Justice of the Province of Quebec and Galipeault J.A. dissenting.\nThis Court is limited to the consideration of the points of dissent. Galipeault J.A. states in his reasons that he would have ordered a new trial \"m'arr\u00eatant uniquement aux griefs de l'appelant \u00e0 l'encontre de la charge du Juge\". Likewise Chief Justice Letourneau dissented exclusively on the ground that the trial judge's charge to the jury was incomplete and erroneous in certain respects and that it had exceeded the limitations imposed by the rules of law. He also would have granted a new trial. The majority of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) was of opinion that no fault could be found in the learned judge's charge and the appeal of the accused should be dismissed.\nVery properly Chief Justice Letourneau avoided discussing the circumstances of the trial, in view of the fact he thought that a new trial should be granted to the appellant, and I feel that I should do the same.\nHis reasons for dissent were that references in the charge to the facts proven in the case appealed more to the religious or national sentiments of the jury than to the latter's reason. He also thought that since the learned judge had ruled in the course of the trial that the truth of the statements contained in the libel was immaterial, the learned judge should not have undertaken to establish that these statements were erroneous. Further, the Chief Justice considered that the learned trial judge had misdirected himself when he said that, if the jury was of the opinion that the incriminated document was of a nature to insinuate that in the Province of Quebec the administra\u00adtion of justice was biased, that the Catholic clergy controlled the Courts, and that there existed in that Province an apparent hate for God and Christ and Freedom, then the jury ought to find the accused guilty.\nThe learned Chief Justice also found fault with the ruling of the presiding judge to the effect that a certain objection to a question put by Counsel for the defence and of a nature to establish the good faith of the accused should not have been maintained.\nIn addition to the above, the dissent also expresses the view that when dealing with the question of reasonable doubt, at the request of Counsel for the defence, the learned trial judge misdirected himself again when he stated that in the present case he could not see where the jury could find that there was a doubt.\nFinally, the dissent also refers to a direction alleged to have been made by the trial judge in reference to the good faith of the accused, that after the jury had read the incriminated document they would have to decide if such document was really of a nature to re-establish good will between the Witnesses of Jehovah and the people of the Province of Quebec, which, the accused had stated in evidence, was his purpose in publishing the document; and when, after the charge had been delivered to the jury, the learned presiding judge was asked to inform the jury as to the nature of a blasphematory libel and a defamatory libel as contrasted to a seditious libel, the learned judge defined both defamatory and blasphematory libel, but he added:\nThis was not the accusation brought against the accused. I do not believe that there is here in the document anything blasphematory. C'est plut\u00f4t un libelle s\u00e9ditieux qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit.\nThe dissent finds that such a declaration on the part of the trial judge was of a nature to influence the verdict. The learned Chief Justice, therefore, concluded that the charge was erroneous, both on the ground of misdirection and non-direction and that, as a consequence, the verdict was tainted with illegality.\nNow those are the grounds of dissent. It does not belong to this Court to pass upon any other passage of the charge of the learned trial judge, nor to decide itself whether there was any ground for coming to the conclusion that the document now in question, and for which the accused was brought to trial, was or was not a seditious libel. If this Court were to so decide, it would attribute to itself a finding which is exclusively the province of the jury. As an illustration of this, I might point out that under Section 133 (a) of the Criminal Code the question of the good faith of the accused forms a necessary part of the circumstances to which the jury must direct its attention; and, of course, good faith is essentially a matter left to the jury, properly directed, and regarding which this Court has no right to interfere.\nI would be willing to accept some of the reasons of the learned Chief Justice of the Province of Quebec, and to say that, on some of the points he refers to, the charge was incomplete and perhaps even erroneous, although, with respect, I do not agree with him in his interpretation of some of the statements made by the trial judge.\nI may say, at once, without referring to any of the passages in the document distributed by the accused, that I agree with the rule laid down by Lord Cairns in Metro\u00adpolitan Railway Company v. Jackson[3] and would apply it to the present case:\nThe Judge has a certain duty to discharge, and the jurors have another and a different duty. The judge has to say whether any facts have been established by evidence from which negligence may be reasonably inferred; the jurors have to say whether, from those facts, when submitted to them, negligence ought to be inferred. It is, in my opinion, of the greatest importance in the administration of justice that these separate functions should be maintained, and should be maintained distinct. It would be a serious inroad on the province of the Jury, if, in a case where there are facts from which negligence may reasonably be inferred, the Judge were to withdraw the case from the jury upon the ground that, in his opinion, negligence ought not to be inferred; and it would, on the other hand, place in the hands of the jurors a power which might be exercised in the most arbitrary manner, if they were at liberty to hold that negligence might be inferred from any state of facts whatever. In the present case all that was necessary for the Crown to do was to file the document and to prove that the accused had published it within the meaning of the law. That is what the learned trial judge stated and meant when he said:\nJ'en conclus done, et sur ce point vous devez suivre ma direction, que la preuve de la Couronne a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e8te par le fait d'avoir produit le pamphlet et le fait d'en avoir prouv\u00e9 la distribution.\nThis sentence cannot be understood otherwise than to say that the Crown had adduced all the evidence necessary to allow the jury to render a verdict on the accusation, but it does not mean that the Crown had proven its case.\nFar from agreeing with the dissenting judgment of the learned Chief Justice where he quotes the presiding judge as saying:\n... si vous croyez qu'un document de cette nature peut laisser croire \u00e0 nos canadiens de langue anglaise que dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, la justice n'est pas observ\u00e9e, que le clerg\u00e9 a le contr\u00f4le sur les tribunaux et enfin, qu'il y a dans la Province de Qu\u00e9bec une haine ardente pour le Christ, pour Dieu et pour la libert\u00e9, dans ce cas-l\u00e0, vous devez condamner Boucher.\nAnd where he says that the remarks of the trial judge were \"of a nature to prejudice and vitiate the verdict\", I would point out that such a passage should not have been detached from its context. The whole passage reads as follows:\nSi vous trouvez qu'il n'y a rien de s\u00e9ditieux dans cet article, vous devez acquitter Bouclier. D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, si vous l'avez lu, apr\u00e8s en. avoir appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 tous les termes qu'il contient, vous croyez qu'il peut en. r\u00e9sulter dans la Province de Qu\u00e9bec un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de discorde et de trouble qui peut devenir s\u00e9rieux, si vous croyez qu'un document de cette nature peut laisser croire \u00e0 nos canadiens de langue anglaise que dans la Province de Qu\u00e9bec, la justice n'est pas observ\u00e9e, que le clerg\u00e9 a le contr\u00f4le sur les tribunaux et enfin, qu'il y a dans la Province de Qu\u00e9bec une haine ardente pour le Christ, pour Dieu et pour la libert\u00e9, dans ce cas-l\u00e0, vous devez condamner Boucher.\nIt is, therefore, apparent that the learned judge was there telling the jury that if they found nothing seditious in the document they had to acquit Boucher, but that if, on the contrary, they thought there was something seditious in it, in the nature of what he enumerates in the passage, then they ought to condemn him. I cannot find anything objectionable in that way of presenting the matter to the jury. Then in respect of the objection to certain evidence which is mentioned in the dissenting judgment and the fact that it was maintained by the learned judge, my humble view is that the question to which the objection was maintained was illegal and that it was properly main\u00adtained. In that instance Boucher was asked to state the impression he intended to convey by a reading of the pamphlet, according to what he himself thought and his appreciation of the pamphlet. Surely it did not exclusively belong to the accused to state to the jury what he intended to convey; it was for the jury itself to come to a con\u00adclusion as to what the document conveyed to the people among whom it was distributed. Again the passage of the charge quoted by the learned Chief Justice is as follows:\nVous lirez ce document-l\u00e0, Exhibit P-1, et vous d\u00e9ciderez si r\u00e9ellement il est de nature \u00e0 ramener la bonne entente entre les t\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah et les gens de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nThis is merely a reference to the fact that Boucher had claimed that he had distributed the document in order to \"ramener la bonne entente entre les t\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah et les gens de la province de Qu\u00e9bec\"; and the learned judge was telling the jury that, having read the pamphlet, it was for them to decide whether it was of a nature to bring about what Boucher had contended.\nThe learned Chief Justice also points to the sentence in the charge:\nC'est plut\u00f4t un libelle s\u00e9ditieux qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit.\nThe meaning of that sentence is quite clear, more particularly if it is read in conjunction with the context. The learned trial judge had been asked by Counsel for the accused to instruct the jury on the nature of blasphe\u00admatory and defamatory libel. He gave the instruction asked for and then concluded by saying:\nBut in this case you are not concerned with either of those. The document which has been filed, if anything, is rather a seditious libel.\nWith due respect, I cannot find any other meaning to that sentence which, of course, so understood cannot be held to be objectionable.\nThat concludes my analysis and review of the dissenting judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Quebec. I am of opinion that the several points to which I have just referred were not well taken. However, I would otherwise agree with the remainder of his reasoning and, on that account, I am of opinion that a new trial should be ordered in this case.\nNow, dealing with a general review of the case, I would first observe that the French version of the document is the one to which the attention of the jury should be brought, because admittedly the region in which it was distributed is largely, if not exclusively, French speaking. The document in French would, therefore, be the one that could affect the people among which it was published. Having read it several times I would say without hesitation that it contains statements upon which the jury might reasonably come to the conclusion that such statements are in the nature of seditious libels; and, applying the language of Lord Cairns in the Metropolitan Railway Company case (supra), my view would be that the pre-siding judge could direct the jury that it might reasonably infer that the document could be looked upon, under Canadian law, as a seditious libel. It would, of course, be for the jurors to say whether, when submitted to them, guilt ought to be inferred. Merely as an illustration of what I have in mind I would refer to the several passages where the document says that the French Canadian Courts are so much under the influence of the Catholic priests that they are thereby induced to confirm infamous sentences and to render judgments not according to their judicial duties and oath, but as a result of the influence of -the priests.\nHere is the passage to which I refer. The French version reads:\nToutes les cours Canadiennes Fran\u00e7aises \u00e9taient tellement sous l'influence sacerdotale qu'elles confirm\u00e8rent la sentence inf\u00e2me, et ce ne fut que lorsque la cause fut port\u00e9e en Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada que le jugement fut renvers\u00e9.\nThe English version reads:\nAll the French Canadian courts were so under priestly thumbs that they affirmed the infamous sentence, and it was not until the case reached the Supreme Court of 'Canada that judgment was reversed.\nPerhaps it should be noted here that the statement that the judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court of Canada is a falsity. The judgment in question is that of Brodie v. The King[4], having been reported, it is therefore public and it is sufficient to refer to that judgment 'to see that it is absolutely incorrect to say that there was a reversal. The Supreme Court merely quashed the indictment and the conviction on the ground that the necessary averments were omitted and the necessary ingredients were lacking in the indictment preferred against the appellants and that their absence constituted defects in matters of sub-stance. But the Court stated that the Crown was at liberty \"to prefer a fresh indictment if so advised.\"\nIn Canada it should not be forgotten that the criminal law of the country is contained in the Criminal Code; and as was pointed out in Brodie v. The King:\nIt cannot be that the criminal law should be administered as though there were no code.\nThe sections of the Criminal Code referring to seditious libel are sections 133 and 133A. This was first enacted by section 123, chap. 25, 55-56 Victoria (1892), the section then having four paragraphs. In 1906, by sec. 132, chap. 146 of the Revised Statutes of Canada adopted in that year, sec. 123, above mentioned, was amended by the deletion of paragraph one of that section. In 1927 when the subsequent Revised Statutes of Canada were adopted this section 132, of chap. 146, R.S.C. 1906, was retained without amendment as sec. 133. By chap. 29, 1936 S.C., a fourth paragraph was added to sec. 133. In addition in 1930 a new section 133A, was enacted by chap. 11 of the Statutes of Canada of that year, and that section was retained without amendment in the amendments of 1947.\nUnder the law as it stood at the material time, that is when the appellant distributed what is alleged to have been the seditious libel, section 133 stated that \"a seditious libel is a libel expressive of a seditious intention\".\nIt was argued by Counsel for the appellant that the Code does not define \"seditious intention\". Of course, subsection (4) of section 133. enacts that \"everyone shall be presumed to have a seditious intention who publishes, or circulates any writing, printing or document in which it is advocated or who teaches or advocates, the use, without the authority of law, of force, as a means of accomplishing any governmental change within Canada\"; but the sub\u00adsection begins by the words \"without limiting the gener\u00adality of the meaning of the expression 'seditious intention' \". Therefore, we have it here that the advocating of force is not the only instance in which an accused could be found guilty of a \"seditious intention\".\nThen if we turn to section 133A, also in force when the present appellant was proven to have distributed the seditious libel, the legislator there indicated certain cases where one would not be deemed to have had a seditious intention only because he intends in good faith\n(c) to point out, in order to their removal, matters which are pro\u00adducing or have a tendency to produce feelings of hatred and ill-will between different classes of His Majesty's subjects.\nOf course, one cannot but be impressed by the analogy of that section added in 1930 with sections 114 and 115 of Stephen's \"Digest of the Criminal Law\", as they were at the time of the drafting of the Criminal Code in Canada in 1892, and also by the definition of \"sedition\" given by Russell \"On Crime\", Vol. 1, 9th edit., p. 87.\nBut the very fact that the Canadian Code has dealt with the matter compels the Canadian Courts to administer the law with regard to seditious libel in accordance with the Canadian legislation and not in accordance with state\u00adments by commentators in England, or even with pro\u00adnouncements by judges administering justice in Great Britain. Indeed that was the very ruling of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Wallace-Johnson v. The King[5], where it was held that the provisions of the Gold Coast Criminal Code were clear and unambiguous and intended to contain as far as possible a full and complete statement of the law of sedition in the Colony, and that, therefore, the English common law as expounded in a judgment rendered in England was inapplicable. Under Part I of the Canadian Criminal Code (sections 8 et seq.) the Courts in this country can refer to the law of England only in so far as a matter has not been dealt with by the Canadian Parliament. Even if in section 133, as it was originally enacted, we did not find sufficient to decide what Parliament thought should be considered as a seditious intention, we certainly have some indication of the legislator's mind in subsection (4) as it now stands and as it was introduced by the amendment of 1936. As already pointed out, what is stated there as creating a pre\u00adsumption of seditious intention is qualified by the words \"without limiting the generality of the meaning of the expression\".\nSection 133A, introduced in 1930, by chap. 11 of the Statutes of Canada of that year, undoubtedly contains some indication of the legislator's view of what constitutes seditious intention under the law of Canada. Subsection (c) refers to the pointing out of matters which are pro\u00adducing or have a tendency to produce feelings of hatred and ill-will between different classes of His Majesty's subjects and it says that if one only intends \"in order to their removal, to point out such matters\", he shall not be deemed to have a seditious intention if he \"intends it\" in \"good faith\". It necessarily follows that even pointing out these matters in order to their removal will not relieve an accused of the guilt of seditious intention unless he did it in good faith. Therefore, if you have a matter which is producing, or has a tendency to produce feelings of hatred and ill-will between different classes of His Majesty's subjects, a jury would be justified in finding that a man, under Canadian jurisdiction, ought to be found guilty of seditious libel, unless the jury comes to the conclusion that the man in question pointed out these matters \"in order to their removal\" and that he did so \"in good faith.\"\nIn my humble view, therefore, it is unnecessary in the present case to refer to any pronouncements either in Great Britain, and less so in the United States, as the learned Counsel for the appellant invited us to do, because here in Canada we have the precise legislation on the issue; and what the jury alone has to decide here with regard to Boucher is :\n(1) Whether the document which he distributed con\u00adtained matters which were producing, or had a tendency to produce feelings of hatred and ill-will between classes of His Majesty's subjects; ;\n(2) Whether he pointed out these matters in order to their removal; and (3) Whether he did so in good faith.\nThese three questions are strictly the province of the jury. I cannot see by what authority this Court should decide that Boucher pointed out these matters in order to their removal, or that he did so in good faith, more particularly in view of the fact that the Supreme Court of Canada's jurisdiction in criminal cases is limited to point of dissent in the Court of Appeal. There was abso\u00adlutely no dissent on these matters in the Court below. The dissenting opinions of Letourneau C.J. and of Galipeault J.A. are expressly limited to misdirections, or non-direc\u00adtions, in the learned trial judge's charge; and the only points which this Court has to decide are whether the alleged misdirections, or non-directions, are really to be found in the charge, and the consequence can only be that there should be a new trial, if they are so found.\nI would not like to part this appeal, however, without stating that to interpret freedom as licence is a dangerous fallacy. Obviously pure criticism, or expression of opinion, however severe or extreme, is, I might almost say, to be invited. But, as was said elsewhere, \"there must be a point where restriction on individual freedom of expres\u00adsion is justified and required on the grounds of reason, or on the ground of the democratic process and the necessities of the present situation\". It should not be understood from this Court--the Court of last resort in criminal matters in Canada-that persons subject to Canadian jurisdiction \"can insist on their alleged unrestricted right to say what they please and when they please, utterly irrespective of the evil results which are often inevitable\". It might well be said in such a case, in the words of Milton, \"Licence they mean when they cry liberty\", or as expressed Mr. Edouard Herriot, \"La libert\u00e9 doit trouver sa imite dans l'autorit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale\".\nFor these reasons in is particular appeal, the convic\u00adtion should be set aside on the grounds of misdirection and non-direction, and a new trial should be directed.\nKERWIN J.\u2011This is an appeal by the accused from a decision of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) for the Province of Quebec[6], affirming his conviction for publishing a seditious libel contrary to section 133 of the Criminal Code. Chief Justice Letourneau dissented and, as Mr. Justice Galipeault agreed with his reasons, reference thereto may conveniently be made throughout as expressing the dissent with which this Court is concerned. Prior to the hearing, we dismissed a motion by the Crown to quash the appeal on the ground that the dissent was on ques\u00adtions of fact alone because we are all of opinion that there was dissent on questions of law.\nThe charge against the accused is that he published a seditious libel by distributing copies of a pamphlet to several persons at St. Joseph, in the District of Beauce, which pamphlet contained certain alleged seditious pass-ages. The editors of the pamphlet are stated therein to be Watch Tower Bible and Truth Society, Toronto, Ont., and the accused is a member of Jehovah's Witnesses. There is no doubt as to the publication by the accused in the manner charged but the question is whether what he published constituted the criminal offence known as seditious libel.\nSection 133 of the Criminal Code under which the charge was laid must be considered together with section 133A enacted in 1930, and these now read:\n133. Seditious words are words expressive of a seditious intention.\n2. A seditious libel is a libel expressive of a seditious intention.\n3. A seditious conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to carry into execution a seditious intention.\n4. Without limiting the generality of the meaning of the expression \"seditious intention\" everyone shall be presumed to have a seditious intention who publishes, or circulates any writing, printing or document in which it is advocated, or who teaches or advocates, the use, without the authority of law, of force, as a means of accomplishing any govern-mental change within Canada.\n133A. No one shall be deemed to have a seditious intention only because he intends in good faith,\u2011\n(a) to show that His Majesty has been misled or mistaken in. his measures; or\n(b) to point out errors or defects in the government or constitution of the United Kingdom, or of any part of it, or of Canada or of any province thereof, or in either House of Parliament of the United Kingdom or of Canada, or in any legislature, or in the administration of justice; or to excite His Majesty's subjects to attempt to procure, by lawful means, the alteration of any matter in the state; or,\n(c) to point out, in order to their removal, matters which are pro\u00adducing or have a tendency to produce feelings of hated and ill-will between different classes of His Majesty's subjects. Subsection 4 of section 133 was' enacted in 1936, at which time Parliament repealed the much discussed section 98, but for our purposes subsection 4 need not be considered. With the exception of this subsection, these enactments follow the corresponding provisions of the Draft Criminal Code, prepared by the Commissioners in England and while \"seditious intent\" is nowhere defined in our Code, it has always been accepted that the definition proposed by the Commissioners accurately sets forth the law of England on the subject. This definition had been adopted by the Commissioners almost verbatim from that found in Stephen's Digest of the Criminal Law. As explained by Cave J. in Reg. v. Burns[7], the latter had the authority not only of Mr. Justice Stephen but also of the very learned judges who were associated with him in drafting the proposed English Criminal Code. On the following page, Cave J. points out that Mr. Justice Stephen was a judge of very great accuracy and that, for the proposition laid down in his Digest for seditious libel, there was to be found undoubted authority. The authorities and the history of the matter are set out in Volume 2 of the History of the Criminal Law of England by the same author at p. 298 et seq. That definition should be adopted as the law of Canada.\nThe definition appears as article 114 in the 8th edition of Stephen's Digest and, together with article 115, are as follows:\nARTICLE 114\nSEDITIOUS INTENTION DEFINED\nA seditious intention is an intention to bring into hatred or contempt, or to excite disaffection against the person of, Ills Majesty, his heirs or successors, or the government and constitution of the United Kingdom, as by law established, or either House of Parliament, or the administration of justice, or to excite His Majesty's subjects to attempt otherwise than by lawful means, the alteration of any matter in Church or State by law established, or to incite any person to commit any crime in disturbance of the peace, or to raise discontent or disaffection amongst His Majesty's subjects, or to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of such subjects.\nAn intention to show that His Majesty has been misled or mistaken in his measures, or to point out errors or defects in the government or constitution as by law established, with a view to their reformation, or to excite His Majesty's subjects to attempt by lawful means the alteration of any matter in Church or State by law established, or to point out, in order to their removal, matters which are producing, or have a tendency to produce, feelings of hatred and ill-will between classes of His Majesty's subjects, is not a seditious intention.\nARTICLE 115\nPRESUMPTION AS TO INTENTION\nIn determining whether the intention with which any words were spoken, any document was published, or any agreement was made, was or was not seditious, every person must be deemed to intend the conse\u00adquences which would naturally follow from his conduct at the time and under the circumstances in which he so conducted himself.\nThe accused as one of the members of Jehovah's Wit\u00adnesses distributed a pamphlet in which complaint was made of what was said to have occurred with reference to some of those members. He was entitled to complain of what he conceived to be existing grievances and, in so doing, he was not restricted to a calm and dispassionate expos\u00e9, such as might be expected in a court of law.\nSpecifically, he was entitled to point out what he alleged were errors or defects in the administration of justice and also, in order to effect their removal, matters which were producing, or had a tendency to produce, feelings of hatred and ill-will between the residents of the Province of Quebec and Jehovah's Witnesses. Evidence could be led by the accused in an endeavour to show the truth of these state\u00adments as it would be relevant, but as was admitted by counsel for the accused, relevant only, to the question whether the accused intended to point out those matters in good faith as provided by section 133A of our Code.\nChief Justice Letourneau points out that after ruling that the truth or falsity of the allegations made in the pamphlet was immaterial, the trial judge, at various times, picked out various passages in the pamphlet and, referring to each, said: \"C'est encore une fausset\u00e9\". I agree with the Chief Justice that the issue of good faith was not put accurately to the jury.\nThe question of seditious libel is always one of great delicacy, requiring from the trial judge an instruction distinctly drawing to the attention of the jury the various elements that must be found before they may convict of the offence charged and applying the law to the evidence in the record. I agree with the Chief Justice that this was not done in the present case. The main element which it was necessary for the jury to find was an intention on the part of the accused to incite the people to violence or to create a public disturbance or disorder: Reg. v. Burns supra; Reg. v. Sullivan[8]; Rex v. Aldred[9]; The King v. Gaunt not reported but referred to in a note in 64 L.Q.R. 203. The use of strong words is not by itself sufficient nor is the likelihood that readers of the pamphlet in St. Joseph de Beauce would be annoyed or even angered, but the question is, was the language used calculated to promote public disorder or physical force or violence. In coming to a conclusion on this point, a jury is entitled to consider the state of society or, as it is put by Chief Justice Wilde in his charge to the jury in The Queen v. Fussell[10]\u2011\nYou cannot, as it seems to me, form a correct judgment of how far the evidence tends to establish the crime imputed to the defendant, without bringing into that box with you a knowledge of the present stale of society, because the conduct of every individual in regard to the effect which that conduct is calculated to produce, must depend upon the state of the society in which he lives. This may be innocent in one state of society, because it may not tend to disturb the peace or to interfere with the right of the community, which at another time, and in a different state of society, in consequence of its different tendency, may be open to just censure.\nThis, it should be noted, was said at a trial at the Central Criminal Court before the Chief Justice, Baron Parke and Maule J. An instruction to the same effect was given in Reg. v. Burns supra by gave J., of whose charge it is stated generally, at page 88 of the 9th edition of Russell on Crime, that the present view of the law is best stated therein. Reference might also be made to the words of Coleridge J. in his charge to the jury in the later case of Rex v. Aldred[11]:\u2011\nYou are entitled also to take into account the state of public feeling. Of course there are times when a spark will explode a powder magazine; the effect of language may be very different at one time from what it would be at another.\nWhile the jury must consider the question of good faith in accordance with section 133A of our Code, it will be noticed that that section specifically states that no one shall be deemed to have a seditious intention only because he intends in good faith to show or point out the matters mentioned. The jury should be charged that if they find good faith on the part of the accused, and if in their opinion there is nothing more in the case, the accused is entitled to an acquittal; but, if in addition to that good faith, there was an intention on the part of the accused to create public disorder or promote physical force, or that notwithstanding the motives of the accused the natural tendency of the words (and therefore the intention) was to create such disturbances, then they would be entitled to find a verdict of guilty.\nThe decision of the Judicial Committee in Wallace-Johnson v. The King[12], is not of assistance as there it was held merely that the provisions of the Gold Coast Criminal Code were clear and unambiguous, and intended to contain as far as possible a full and complete statement of the law of sedition in the Colony, and that, therefore, the English common law as expounded in the Burns Case was inapplicable. Nor are the quoted decisions in the Supreme and other Courts of the United States of any real help. Many of them deal with the \"clear and present danger\" doctrine in construing statutes with reference to the applicability of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution and all depend upon that Constitution and laws which are alleged to infringe its provisions. It is strictly unnecessary to consider Chief Justice Letourneau's dissent that the trial judge did not charge the jury sufficiently or properly on the question of reasonable doubt but even if the dissent be not well-founded, the charge in this respect exhibits the very minimum that could be held to be sufficient and is not to be recommended.\nThere was evidence in the document itself, taken, as it must be, with all the other circumstances, upon which a jury after a proper charge as outlined above, could find the accused guilty, and the conviction should, therefore, be set aside and a new trial directed.\nSince the distribution of my reasons in this appeal, there has been a reargument as a result of which I have been persuaded that the order suggested by me is not the proper one to make. With the exception of the last paragraph, what I have already said may stand, with the following additions. The intention on the part of the accused which is necessary to constitute seditious libel must be to incite the people to violence against constituted authority or to create a public disturbance or disorder against such authority. To what is stated previously that \"the question is, was the language used calculated to promote public disorder or physical force or violence\", there should be added that that public disorder or physical force or violence must be against established authority. An intention to bring the administration of justice into hatred or contempt or exert disaffection against it is not seditious unless there is also the intention to incite people to violence against it. So far as the decision in R. v. M'Hugh[13] is in conflict with this opinion, it should not be followed.\nWhatever else might be said of the contents of the pamphlet, there is not in it, read in the light of all the surrounding circumstances, any evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed, could find the appellant guilty of the crime with which he was charged. The conviction should be set aside and a judgment and verdict of acquittal entered.\nTASCHEREAU J. (dissenting):\u2011At the first hearing of this appeal, the Court did not agree as to the ingredients that are necessary to constitute the offence of seditious libel. Upon application, a new hearing was granted and heard by the full Court, and in view of the opinions now expressed by the majority, it is settled I think that gener\u00adally speaking, the writings complained of must, in addition to being calculated to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of His Majesty's subjects, be intended to produce disturbance of or resistance to the lawfully constituted authority.\nBut as pointed out by my brother Cartwright, there is another definition of seditious intention which I think, must be accepted. I agree with him that an intention to bring the administration of justice into hatred or con-tempt or to excite disaffection against it, is a seditious intention. In the present case, there is I think sufficient evidence upon which a properly instructed jury could find that there was a seditious intention.\nI have no doubt, that in view of the defective charge of the trial judge, this appeal cannot be dismissed, and I would therefore for the reasons given by my brother Cart\u00adwright, quash the conviction and direct a new trial.\nRAND J.:\u2011For the reasons given by me following the first argument, I would allow the appeal, set aside the verdict and conviction and enter judgment of not guilty.\n(The reasons given by Mr. Justice Rand, following the first argument, read as follows).\nThis appeal arises out of features of what, in substance, is religious controversy, and it is necessary that the facts be clearly appreciated. The appellant, a farmer, living near the town of St. Joseph de Beauce, Quebec, was con\u00advicted of uttering a seditious libel. The libel was contained in a four page document published apparently at Toronto by the Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, which I take to be the name of the official publishers of the religious group known as The Witnesses of Jehovah. The document was headed \"Quebec's Burning Hate for God and Christ and Freedom Is the Shame of all Canada\" : it consisted first of an invocation to calmness and reason in appraising the matters to be dealt with in support of the heading; then of general references to vindictive persecution accorded in Quebec to the Witnesses as brethren in Christ; a detailed narrative of specific incidents of persecution; and a concluding appeal to the people of the province, in protest against mob rule and gestapo tactics, that through the study of God's Word and obedience to its commands, there might be brought about a \"bounteous crop of the good fruits of love for Him and Christ and human freedom\". At the foot of the document is an advertisement of two books entitled \"Let God be True\" and \"Be Glad, Ye Nations\", the former revealing, in the light of God's Word, the truth concerning the Trinity, Sabbath, prayer, etc., and the latter, the facts of the endurance of Witnesses in the crucible of \"fiery persecution\". The incidents, as described, are of peaceable Canadians who seem not to be lacking in meekness, but who, for dis\u00adtributing, apparently without permits, bibles and tracts on Christian doctrine; for conducting religious services in private homes or on private lands in Christian fellowship; for holding public lecture meetings to teach religious truth as they believe it of the Christian religion; who, for this exercise of what has been taken for granted to be the unchallengeable rights of Canadians, have been assaulted and beaten and their bibles and publications torn up and destroyed, by individuals and by mobs; who have had their homes invaded and their property taken; and in hundreds have been charged with public offences and held to exorbitant bail. The police are declared to have ex\u00adhibited an attitude of animosity toward them and to have treated them as the criminals in provoking by their action of Christian profession and teaching, the violence to which they have been subjected; and public officials and members of the Roman Catholic Clergy are said not only to have witnessed these outrages but to have been privy to some of the prosecutions. The document charged that the Roman Catholic Church in Quebec was in some objection-able relation to the administration of justice and that the force behind the prosecutions was that of the priests of that Church.\nThe conduct of the accused appears to have been unexceptionable; so far as disclosed, he is an exemplary citizen who is at least sympathetic to doctrines of the Christian religion which are, evidently, different from either the Protestant or the Roman Catholic versions: but the founda\u00adtion in all is the same, Christ and his relation to God and humanity.\nThe crime of seditious libel is well known to the Common Law. Its history has been thoroughly examined and traced by Stephen, Holdsworth and other eminent legal scholars and they are in agreement both in what it origin-ally consisted and in the social assumptions underlying it. Up to the end of the 18th century it was, in essence, a contempt in words of political authority or the actions of authority. If we conceive of the governors of society as superior beings, exercising a divine mandate, by whom laws, institutions and administrations are given to men to be obeyed, who are, in short, beyond criticism, reflection or censure upon them or what they do implies either an equality with them or an accountability by them, both equally offensive. In that lay sedition by words and the libel was its written form.\nBut constitutional conceptions of a different order making rapid progress in the 19th century have necessitated a modification of the legal view of public criticism; and the administrators of what we call democratic government have come to be looked upon as servants, bound to carry out their duties accountably to the public. The basic nature of the Common Law lies in its flexible process of traditional reasoning upon significant social and political matter; and just as in the 17th century the crime of seditious libel was a deduction from fundamental con\u00adceptions of government, the substitution of new con\u00adceptions, under the same principle of reasoning, called for new jural conclusions: Bourne v. Keane[14].\nAs early as 1839 in Rex v. Neale[15], Littledale, J., in his charge to the jury, laid it down that \"you are to con\u00adsider ... whether they meant to excite the people to take the power into their own hands, and meant to excite them to tumult and disorder ; the people have a right to discuss any grievances they have to complain of but they must not do it in a way to excite tumult\", which Stephen, in Vol. 2 of his History of the Criminal Law at page 375, sums up : \"In one word, nothing short of direct incitement to disorder and violence is a seditious libel\". Coleridge, J. in Rex v. Aldred[16], used these words: \"The man who is accused may not plead the truth of the statement he makes as a defence to the charge; nor may he plead the innocence of his motive. That is not a defence to the charge. The test is not either the truth of the language or the innocence of the motive with which he publishes it. The test is this: was the language used calculated, or was it not, to promote public disorder or physical force\": (85 Sol, J. (1941), 251). The language used must, obviously, be related to the particular matters in each case complained of. This development is to be considered also in the light of the practice in administering the law of seditious words followed after Fox's Libel Act of 1792. The jury in such cases by its right under the statute to bring in a general verdict, must, in addition to the publication of the libel and its meaning, have found a seditious intention. That meant more than the issue of the writing knowing what it contained. The Act was interpreted as requiring the libel to have been published with an illegal intention. The word \"intention\" was not always clearly differentiated from indirect purpose or motive, but if the intention, as en\u00advisaging immediate or proximate response, regardless of a remote object of whatever nature, was illegal, the libel was seditious.\nStephen suggests a theoretical continuity of the law by taking that Act to have made material those consequential allegations such as of ill-will, disaffection, etc., with which the early indictments were liberally encumbered, but which were looked upon as formal or assumed as necessary effects of the libel otherwise seditious. But if that is sound, then we must have regard to the sense which they then bore; and it would seem to be clear that they signified feelings and attitudes toward established authority.\nThe definition of seditious intention as formulated by Stephen, summarised, is, (1) to bring into hatred or con-tempt, or to excite disaffection against, the King or the Government and Constitution of the United Kingdom, or either House of Parliament, or the administration of justice; or (2) to excite the King's subjects to attempt, otherwise than by lawful means, the alteration of any matter in Church or State by law established; or (3) to incite persons to commit any crime in general disturbance of the peace; or (4) to raise discontent or disaffection amongst His Majesty's subjects; or (5) to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of such subjects. The only items of this definition that could be drawn into question here are that relating to the adminis\u00adtration of justice in (1) and those of (4) and (5). It was the latter which were brought most prominently to the notice of the jury, and it is with an examination of what in these days their language must be taken to mean that I will chiefly concern myself.\nThere is no modern authority which holds that the mere effect of tending to create discontent or disaffection among His Majesy's subjects or ill-will or hostility between groups of them, but not tending to issue in illegal conduct, con\u00adstitutes the crime, and this for obvious reasons. Freedom in thought and speech and disagreement in ideas and beliefs, on every conceivable subject, are of the essence of our life. The clash of critical discussion on political, social and religious subjects has too deeply become the stuff of daily experience to suggest that mere ill-will as a product of controversy can strike down the latter with illegality. A superficial examination of the word shows its insufficiency: what is the degree necessary to criminality? Can it ever, as mere subjective condition, be so? Controversial fury is aroused constantly by differences in abstract concep\u00adtions; heresy in some fields is again a mortal sin; there can be fanatical puritanism in ideas as well as in mortals; but our compact of free society accepts and absorbs these differences and they are exercised at large within the frame-work of freedom and order on broader and deeper uniformi\u00adties as bases of social stability. Similarly in discontent, affection and hostility: as subjective incidents of contro\u00adversy, they and the ideas which arouse them are part of our living which ultimately serve us in stimulation, in the clarification of thought and, as we believe, in the search for the constitution and truth of things generally.\nAlthough Stephen's definition was adopted substantially as it is by the Criminal Code Commission of England in 1880, the latter's report, in this respect, was not acted on by the Imperial Parliament, and the Criminal Code of this country, enacted in 1891, did not incorporate its pro-visions. The latter omits any reference to definition except in section 133 to declare that the intention includes the advocacy of the use of force as a means of bringing about a change of government and by section 133A, that certain actions are not included. What the words in (4) and (5) must in the present day be taken to signify is the use of language which, by inflaming the minds of people into hatred, ill-will, discontent, disaffection, is intended, or is so likely to do so as to be deemed to be intended, to dis-order community life, but directly or indirectly in relation to government in the broadest sense: Phillimore, J. in R. v. Antonelli[17] \"seditious libels are such as tend to disturb the government of this country ... \". That may be through tumult or violence, in resistance to public authority, in defiance of law. This conception lies behind the association which the word is given in section 1 of chapter 10, C.S. Lower Canada (1860) dealing with illegal oaths:\nTo engage in any seditious, rebellious or treasonable purpose;\nand the corresponding section 130 of the Criminal Code:\nTo engage in any mutinous or seditious purpose.\nThe baiting or denouncing of one group by another or others without an aim directly or indirectly at government, is in the nature of public mischief : R. v. Leese & White-head[18]; and incitement to unlawful acts is itself an offence.\nThis result must be distinguished from an undesired reaction provoked by the exercise of common rights, such as the violent opposition to the early services of the Salvation Army. In that situation it was the hoodlums who were held to be the lawless and not the members of the Army: Beatty v. Gillbanks[19]. On the allegations in the document here, had the Salvationists been arrested for bringing about by unlawful assembly a breach of the peace and fined, had they then made an impassioned protest against such treatment of law abiding citizens, and had they thereupon been charged with seditious words, their plight would have been that of the accused in this case.\nThese considerations are confirmed by section 133A of the Code, which is as follows:\nWHAT IS NOT SEDITION.\u2011No one shall be deemed to have a seditious intention only because he intends in good faith,\u2011\n(a) to show that His Majesty has been misled or mistaken in his measures; or\n(b) to point out errors or defects in the government or con\u00adstitution of the United Kingdom, or of any part of it, or of Canada or any province thereof, or in either House of Parliament of the United Kingdom or of Canada, or in any legislature, or in the administration of justice; or to excite His Majesty's sub\u00adjects to attempt 'to procure, by lawful means, the alteration of any matter in the state; or,\n(c) to point out, in order to their removal, matters which are pro\u00adducing or have a tendency to produce feelings of hatred and ill-will between different classes of His Majesty's subjects.\nThis, as is seen, is a fundamental provision which, with its background of free criticism as a constituent of modern democratic government, protects the widest range of public discussion and controversy, so long as it is done in good faith and for the purposes mentioned. Its effect is to eviscerate the older concept of its anachronistic elements. But a motive or ultimate purpose, whether good or believed to be good is unavailing if the means employed is bad; disturbance or corrosion may be ends in themselves, but whether means or ends, their character stamps them, and intention behind them as illegal.\nThe condemned intention lies then in a residue of criticism of government, the negative touchstone of which is the test of good faith by legitimate means toward legiti\u00admate ends. That claim was the real defence in the pro\u00adceedings here but it was virtually ignored by the trial judge. On that failure, as well as others, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench and Galipeault, J. have rested their dissent, and with them I am in agreement.\nBut a further question remains. In the circumstances, should the appellant be subjected to a second trial? Could a jury, properly instructed and acting judicially have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, a seditious intention in circu\u00adlating the document? In the heading is the chief source of resentment but there are also statements, such as the insinuation of the part played by the Church in judicial administration and the role of some of the clergy in the prosecutions, which offend likewise. Now these allegations are inferences and conclusions drawn from the facts and incidents presented in detail which the accused was' ready with evidence to prove, and it is obvious that they and the matters from which they are deduced, must be read together. When it is said that Quebec hates Christ, it is hate sub modo; it means that to persecute is to hate, and that to hate those who follow and love Him, i.e. the Witnesses, for what they do in His service, is to hate Him. Only in that manner can the real intention evidenced by the document be appreciated.\nThe writing was undoubtedly made under an aroused sense of wrong to the Witnesses; but it is beyond dispute that its end and object was the removal of what they con\u00adsidered iniquitous treatment. Here are conscientious pro\u00adfessing followers of Christ who claim to have been denied the right to worship in their own homes and their own manner and to have been jailed for obeying the injunction to \"teach all nations\". They are said to have been called \"a bunch of crazy nuts\" by one of the magistrates. Whatever that means, it may from his standpoint be a correct description; I do not know; but it is not challenged that, as they allege, whatever they did was done peaceably, and, as they saw it, in the way of bringing the light and peace of the Christian religion to the souls of men and women. To say that is to say that their acts were lawful. Whether, in like circumstances, other groups of the Christian Church would show greater forebearance and earnestness in the appeal to Christian charity to have done with such abuses, may be doubtful. The courts below have not, as, with the greatest respect, I think they should have, viewed the document as primarily a burning protest and as a result have lost sight of the fact that, expressive as it is of a deep indignation, its conclusion is an earnest petition to the public opinion of the province to extend to the Witnesses of Jehovah, as a minority, the protection of impartial laws. No one would suggest that the docu\u00adment is intended to arouse French-speaking Roman Catholics to disordering conduct against their own government, and to treat it as directed, with the same purpose, towards the Witnesses themselves in the province, would be quite absurd; in relation to the courts, it is, to use the language of section 133A, pointing out, \"in order to their removal\", what are believed to be \"matters which are producing or have a tendency to produce feelings of hatred and ill-will between different classes of His Majesty's subjects.\" That some of the expressions, divorced from their context, may be extravagant and may arouse resentment, is not, in the circumstances, sufficient to take the intention of the writing as a whole beyond what is recog\u00adnized by section 133A as lawful.\nWhere a conviction is set aside, this Court must dispose of the appeal as the justice of the case requires; and where the evidence offered could not, under a proper instruction, have supported a conviction, the accused must be discharged: Schwartzenhauer v. The King[20] ; Man\u00adchuk v. The King[21]; Savard and Lizotte v. The King[22].\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the con\u00adviction, and order judgment of acquittal to be entered.\nKELLOCK J.:\u2011In opening his argument, counsel for the Attorney General admitted that the charge of the learned trial judge was so defective it could not be supported. Accordingly, the appeal must be allowed and the con\u00adviction of the appellant, confirmed as it was by the Court of Appeal[23] with two members dissenting, must be set aside, and the only question which arises is as to the order which this court should make. The appellant contends that there is no evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed, could find the appellant guilty of seditious libel beyond a reasonable doubt by reason of the publication of the pamphlet here in question. On the other hand, the respondent submits there should be a new trial. In the determination of this question, it is necessary at the outset to consider the true nature of the offence charged.\nBy sec. 133 (a) of the Criminal Code, seditious libel is defined as\na libel expressive of a seditious intention.\nSubsection 4 reads as follows:\nWithout limiting the generality of the meaning of the expression \"seditious intention\" everyone shall be presumed to have a seditious intention who publishes or circulates any writing, printing or document in which it is advocated, or who teaches or advocates, the use, without the authority of law, of force, as a means of accomplishing any govern-mental change within Canada.\nSo far as the Code is concerned, \"seditious intention\" is not defined apart from this subsection, and except for s. 133A, one is forced back to the common law. The pamphlet here in question does not, of course, come within the said subsection.\nCounsel for the Attorney General founds himself upon the definition given in Russell, 9th Ed., p. 87. This is essentially the definition laid down by Sir James Stephen in his \"Digest of the Criminal Law\", which first appeared in 1877.\nIt is not necessary to discuss the whole law of seditious libel, but only so much as is relevant to the points of difference between the parties, namely, whether or not incitement to violence is a necessary ingredient, and whether that part of the definition which states that an intention \"to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of His Majesty's subjects\", taken literally and by itself, is sufficient.\nStephen's complete definition was adopted by the Royal Commissioners in England in s. 102 of their draft code. In a note the Commissioners state that it is as accurate a statement of the existing law as they could make. Their references in support of this statement are set out in Crankshaw, 5th Ed. at p. 542. I have read all of these, but I can find no support in any of them for the second point stated as a bald proposition without more. The only case in which such language appears at all in any of the references given is O'Connell v. The Queen[24], where it is included with other matter in a number of the counts of the indictment there in question, but nowhere does it appear alone as constituting a count. Moreover, the indictment in O'Connell's case was not for seditious libel but for conspiracy. At p. 234 Tindal L.C.J. in advising the House of Lords, said:\nIndeed there can be no question but that the charges contained in the first five counts do amount, in each to the legal offence of conspiracy, and are sufficiently described therein. There can be no doubt but that the agreeing of divers persons together to raise discontent and disaffection amongst the liege subjects of the Queen; to stir up jealousies, hatred and ill-will between different classes of Her Majesty's subjects; and especially to promote among Her Majesty's subjects in Ireland feelings of ill-will and hostility towards Her Majesty's subjects in the other parts of the United Kingdom, and especially in England; which charges are found in each of the five counts which first appear in the indictment-do form a distinct and definite charge in each, against the several defendants, of an agreement between them to do an illegal act,\nLord Campbell, who alone of all the members of the House refers to this matter, says at p. 403 that he con\u00adsiders that any person who deliberately attempts to pro-mote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of Her Majesty's subjects-to make the English be hated by the Irish or the Irish to be hated by the English-is guilty of a \"most culpable proceeding\", and that if several combine to do so they commit a \"misdemeanor.\" Lord Campbell does not equate \"culpable proceeding\" and \"misdemeanor.\" The latter is technically the only offence mentioned and if Lord Campbell intended to describe an offence in each case he certainly knew how to do so.\nAs is frequently mentioned in the authorities, probably no crime has been left in such vagueness of definition as that with which we are here concerned, and its legal mean\u00ading has changed with the years. It is relevant, therefore, to refer to some extent to its history. It is traced by Stephen himself in Vol. II of his \"History of the Criminal Law of England\" at p. 299 ff. He points out that two different views may be taken of the relation between rulers and their subjects. If, on the one hand, the ruler is regarded as the superior of the subject, and being by the nature of his position presumably wise and good, the right\u00adful ruler and guide of the whole population, it must neces\u00adsarily follow that it is wrong to censure him openly; that even if he is mistaken, his mistakes should be pointed out with the utmost respect; and that whether mistaken or not, no censure should be cast upon him likely or designed to diminish his authority. On the other hand, if the ruler is regarded as the agent and servant, and the subject as the wise and good master who is obliged to delegate his power to the 'so-called ruler because, being a multitude, he cannot use it himself, it is obvious that the result must be the opposite. In this view, every member of the public who censures the ruler for the time being exercises in his own person the right which belongs to the whole of which he forms a part. He is finding fault with his servant. If others think differently, they can take the other side of the dispute, and the utmost that can happen is that the servant will be dismissed and another put in his place or perhaps that the arrangement of the household will be modified. The author says that to those who hold this latter view fully and carry it out to all its consequences, there can be no such offence as sedition. There may indeed be breaches of the peace which may destroy or endanger life, limb or property, and there may be incitements to such offences, but no imaginable censure of the government, short of a censure which has an immediate tendency to produce such a breach of the peace, ought to be regarded as criminal. Stephen then makes the statement that each of the above views has had a considerable share in mould\u00ading the law of England.\nwith the practical result of producing the compromise which I have tried to express in the articles of my Digest.\nHoldsworth, in Vol. VIII of his History, refers to the two views outlined by Stephen and says that the first of these views was the accepted view in the 17th century, but that the second was gathering strength during the latter part of the 18th century.\nand is now the accepted view.\nHe does not speak of a \"compromise\" and founds him-self on R. v. Lovett[25], per Littledale J. at 466, and R. v. Sullivan[26], per Fitzgerald J. at 58.\nIn R. v. Lovett (1) the court was concerned with a handbill containing three resolutions passed by a large number of people assembled, calling themselves the \"General Convention\", in which they complained of the use in Birmingham of the metropolitan police from London, the first resolution calling the police \"an unconstitutional force from London\". The third complained of the arrest of a Dr. Taylor, calling it a summary and despotic arrest and stating that it afforded another convincing proof\nof the absence of all justice in England, and clearly shews that there is no security for life, liberty or property till the people have some control over the laws they are called upon to obey.\nThe indictment charged that the defendant intended \"to incite divers liege subjects of the Queen to resist the laws and to resist the persons so being part of the metropolitan police force in the due execution of their duty, and to bring the said force into hatred and contempt, and to procure unlawful meetings, and to cause divers liege sub\u00adjects of the Queen to believe that the laws of this kingdom were unduly administered, and intending to disturb the public peace, and to raise discontent in the minds of the subjects of the Queen, and raise and excite tumult and disobedience to the laws.\"\nLittledale J., in his charge to the jury, said: \"if this paper has a direct tendency to cause unlawful meetings and disturbances, and to lead to a, violation of the laws, that is sufficient to bring it within the terms of this indictment, and it is a seditious libel.\"\nStephen, at p. 375, says with respect to this charge:\nIn one word, nothing short of a direct incitement to disorder and violence is a seditious libel.\nIt therefore clearly appears that in the view of Stephen himself, his definition must be read at the least as implying an intention to incitement to violence. In confirmation of this view, the following appears on p. 381 of the same' work:\nThe question would be whether the writer's object was to procure a remedy by peaceable means, or to promote disaffection and bring about riots.\nIt is noteworthy that the draft code of the Royal Com\u00admissioners was not accepted by Parliament, and in my opinion, incitement to violence toward constituted authority, i.e. government in the broad sense, or resistance having the same object, is, upon the authorities, a necessary ingredient of the intention.\nIn R. v. Sullivan[27], Fitzgerald J., in the course of his address to the grand jury, said at p. 45:\nSedition is a crime against society, nearly allied to that of treason, and it frequently precedes treason by a short interval. Sedition in itself is a comprehensive term, and it embraces all those practices, whether by word, deed or in writing, which are calculated to disturb the tranquillity of the State, and lead ignorant persons to endeavour to subvert the Government and the laws of the empire. The objects of sedition are generally to induce discontent and insurrection and stir up opposition to the Government, and bring the administration of justice into contempt; and the very tendency of sedition is to incite the people to insurrection and rebellion. Sedition has been described as disloyalty in action, and the law considers as sedition all those practices which have for their object to excite discontent or dissatisfaction, to create public disturbance, or to lead to civil war; to bring into hatred or contempt the Sovereign or the Government, the laws or constitution of the realm, and generally all endeavours to promote public disorder.\nAt p. 50 the learned judge also said:\n... there is no sedition in censuring the servants of the Crown, or in. just criticism on the administration of the law, or in seeking redress of grievances or in the fair discussion of all party questions. You should remember that you are the guardians of the liberty and freedom of the press, and that it is your duty to put an innocent interpretation on these publications if you can. But if, on the other hand, from their whole scope, you are coerced to the conclusion that their object and tendency is to foment discontent and disaffection, to excite to tumult and insurrec\u00adtion, to promote the objects of a treasonable conspiracy, to bring the adminisration [sic] of justice into disrepute, or to stir up the people to hatred of the laws and the constitution, then you may, if you think fit, and you ought to find the bills, and send the case to be tried by a petit jury.\nIn R. v. Antonelli[28], Phillimore J. as he then was, in the course of his charge said:\nSeditious libels are such as tend to disturb the government of this country...\nStephen at page 298 of the same work, in referring to seditious offences, says:\nAll these offences presuppose dissatisfaction with the existing government, and censure more or less express upon those by whom its authority is exercised and the offences themselves consist in the display of this dissatisfaction in the various manners enumerated.\nWhile the paragraph begins with the sentence,\nThe second class of offences against internal public tranquillity con\u00adsists of offences not accompanied by or leading to open violence.\nthe author had already said on page 242:\nAnother class of offences against public tranquillity are those in. which no actual force is either employed or displayed, but in which steps are taken tending to cause it. These are the formation of secret societies, seditious conspiracies, libels or words spoken.\nIn R. v. Aldred[29], Coleridge J., in the course of his summing up, said at page 3, with reference to the charge before him:\nThe word \"sedition\" in its ordinary natural signification denotes a tumult, an insurrection, a popular commotion, or an uproar; it implies violence or lawlessness in some form.\nThe learned judge continued:\nThe test is not either the truth of the language or the innocence of the motive with which he published it, but the test is this: was the language used calculated, or was it not, to promote public disorder or physical force or violence in a matter of State? In R. v. Burdett[30], Best J. at page 131 told the jury they were to decide whether the paper there in question was a sober address to reason or an appeal to their passion calculated to incite them to acts of violence and uproar. If the latter, it was a seditious libel. At page 376 of his History, Stephen says that the law as to political libels has not been developed or altered in any way since this case.\nLord Cockburn, in the introduction to his \"Examination of Trials for Sedition in Scotland\", says at page 8:\nThe guilt, when analized, resolves into disrespect towards the authority of the State; meaning by disrespect all criminal obloquy or ridicule, or defiance; and by the State, not merely the supreme power, but all the high political bodies and officers that represent it. The quality indicated by the term political (or by some equivalent term) is essential; because there are many merely public officers or bodies, who, as they represent none of the power of the State, can scarcely be the objects of seditious attack. I do not see how the East India Company or the Bank of England could, as such, be libelled seditiously. To give the attack the quality of seditiousness, it must be capable of being justly viewed as a contempt of public authority. Hence the usual objects of the offence are, the sovereign, the Houses of Parliament, the administrators of justice, public officers and departments wielding and representing the State's power or dignity. It is the public majesty that must be assailed, and that must be required to be protected. Sedition is the same thing, in principle, against the State, with the misconduct of the member of the private society who, because he dislikes something that is done, insults the president and defies the majority. The guilt of sedition is often described as consisting of its tendency to produce public mischief and so it is. But it is not every sort of mischief that will exhaust the des\u00adcription of the offence. It must be that sort of mischief that consists in, and arises out of directly and materially obstructing public authority.\nAt page 20 Lord Cockburn quotes from Starkie at page 525, as follows:\nThe test of intrinsic illegality must, in this as in other cases, be decided by the answer to the question-Has the communication a plain tendency to produce public mischief, by perverting the mind of the subject, and creating a general dissatisfaction with the Government? .. . It may be said, Where is the line to be drawn? ... To this it may be answered that, to render the author criminal, his publication must have proceeded from a malicious mind; bent, not upon making a fair communication, for the purposes of exposing bad measures, but for the sake of exciting tumult and dissatisfaction.\nBaron Hume, in his work published in 1844, says at page 558 of Vol. I:\nFor the characteristic of sedition lies in the forwarding, preparing and producing such a state of things as may naturally issue in public trouble and commotion; and it is thus a different sort of guilt from that of those who are actively engaged in the tumult or rising, if any ensue. Further, riot and sedition differ in their scope and object. Sedition is a State crime; which is levelled against the government, structure of laws, or political order of the land; or at least has relation to some object of public and general concernment; in regard to which, if any hostile rising ensue, the offender shall be guilty of no lower crime than treason. Whereas the objects of riot or convocation of the lieges ... are matters of local and private grievance; things in which a particular place or neighbourhood only is interested, and such as in nowise tend to challenge the authority or unsettle the order or economy of the State ... The crime of sedition lies therefore in the stirring of such humours, as naturally tend to change and commotion in the State.\nAll these authorities are uniform in support of the view which I have above expressed.\nIn Regina v. Burns[31], Cave J., in the course of his charge to the jury as to what was seditious, referred to the definition of Stephen J. and the draft code, and stated that the defendants before him were charged with the seditious intentions, first to incite Her Majesty's subjects to 'attempt otherwise than by lawful means the alteration of some matter in church or state by law established, and second to promote feelings of hostility between different classes of Her Majesty's subjects. After stating that these, and particularly the second, were somewhat vague and general, he went on to say at page 363:\n... if you think that those defendants, if you trace from the whale matter laid before you that they had a seditious intention to incite the people to violence, to create public disturbances and disorder, then undoubtedly you ought to find them guilty. If from any sinister motive, as for instance, notoriety, or for the purpose of personal gain, they desired to bring the people into conflict with the authorities, or to incite them tumultuously and disorderly to damage the property of any unoffending citizens, you ought undoubtedly to find them guilty. On the other hand, if you come to the conclusion that they were actuated by an honest desire to alleviate the misery of the unemployed-if they had a real bona fide desire to bring that misery before the public by constitutional and legal means, you should not be too swift to mark any hasty or ill-considered expression which they might utter in the excitement of the moment.\nAt page 366:\nWhat you are asked to decide on is whether the prisoners ... did upon this occasion, in Trafalgar Square, incite the people whom they were addressing to redress their grievance by violence. Did they inten\u00adtionally incite ill-will between different classes in such a way as to be likely to lead to a disturbance of the public peace?\nEven on the footing of the law laid down in this case, if an intention to incite ill-will between different classes of subjects is sufficient, that incitement, in the view of Cave, J., must be such as naturally leads to violence. In con\u00adnection with the above decision, however, a writer in 85 Solicitor's Journal at page 252 says that there is no direct precedent for the inclusion in the definition of publishing a seditious libel, of incitement of ill-will and hostility be\u00adtween different classes of subjects. This writer says that O'Connell v. The King, ubi cit., is often quoted as an authority for such a view and that Stephen J. had relied apparently on the words of Tindal L.C.J. to which I have already referred. This writer again points out, however, that that case was a case of conspiracy and not of sedition, and goes on to say that stirring up and creating ill-will between classes was the subject of a criminal charge in R. v. Leese[32], reported in The Times of the 22nd of December, 1936, the two classes there being Jews and non-Jews, but the offence charged was not that of seditious libel or seditious words, but of public mischief. It is to be noted that the actual indictment in Burn's' case did not rely alone upon an intention to stir up ill-will between different classes of subjects, but the intention alleged was of\nwickedly, maliciously and seditiously contriving and intending the peace of our said Lady the Queen, and of this realm, and of the liege subjects of our said Lady the Queen, to disquiet and to disturb, and the liege subjects of our said Lady the Queen, to incite and to move to contempt, hatred and dislike of the Government established by law within this realm, and to incite and to move and persuade great numbers of the liege subjects of our said Lady the Queen to insurrections, riots, tumults, and breaches of the peace, and to stir up jealousies, hatred and ill-will between different classes of the said liege subjects, and to prevent by force and arms the execution of the laws of this realm, and the preservation of the public peace.\nand it was alleged that the words complained of were spoken\nof and concerning the Government as established by law within this realm, and of and concerning the Commons House of Parliament and the members thereof, and of and concerning divers liege subjects of our said Lady the Queen whose names are to the jurors aforesaid unknown.\nThe actual subject matter of the trial before Cave, J. therefore, was not simply an indictment charging words spoken tending to create ill-will between classes of subjects simpliciter, but incitement of such ill-will inter alia, all directed against government. In my opinion, there is a great distinction between the subject matter of Burns' case and that of Leese's case. It cannot be that words which, for example, are intended to create ill-will even to the extent of violence between any two of the innumerable groups into which 'society is divided, can, without more, be seditious. In my opinion, 'to render the intention seditious, there must be an intention to incite to violence or resistence or defiance for the purpose of dis\u00adturbing constituted authority. I do not think there is any basis in the authorities for defining the crime on any lower plane.\nThe title of the pamphlet here in question is, \"La haine ardente du Qu\u00e9bec pour Dieu, pour Christ, et pour la libert\u00e9 est un sujet de honte pour tout le Canada.\" The opening paragraph proceeds to plead for a calm and sober consideration of the evidence presented in the pamphlet in support of the title. It is clear that the author identifies the sect (and I do not use the word in any offensive sense) of Jehovah's Witnesses with the servants of Christ. His point is that the experiences of members of the sect in the province, as detailed in the pamphlet (which the 'defence proposed to prove by evidence to which the Crown effectively objected) establish that those who were instru\u00admental, directly or indirectly, in bringing about the occur\u00adrences described, must be considered, as the title states, as hating Christ because, notwithstanding any lip-service to Him, such conduct towards His servants (the Witnesses) speaks louder than words.\nThe pamphlet recites 'at considerable length instances of destruction of Bibles, of mob violence, even on private property, unrestrained by the police, who, instead of arresting the mobsters, arrested the unoffending Witnesses engaged in distributing Bibles or Bible leaflets. It is alleged that the latter were subjected 'to heavy fines, prison sentences and delay in the disposition of these charges, as well as to the exaction of exorbitant bail. The pamphlet concludes on the note that the\nforce behind Quebec's suicidal hate is priest domination. Thousands of Quebec Catholics are so blinded by the priests that they think they serve God's cause in mobbing Jehovah's witnesses. The author quotes St. John 16:2 as foretelling this, and he proceeds to say that such a course will lead to destruc\u00adtion. The reader is asked to avoid this by turning from following men and traditions to the study and the following of Bible teaching.\nThe pamphlet indicates that there existed, in certain sections of the province at least, a strong feeling against the Witnesses, and the argument for the Crown, on the basis that incitement of ill-will between classes is sufficient, was that the publication of this pamphlet would increase such ill-will and subject those engaged in its distribution to attack. In my opinion, it cannot fairly be said that the pamphlet is open to any such construction. There was no doubt opposition on the part of numbers of people to the Witnesses. The pamphlet says so. But the stated object of the pamphlet was to plead for its removal. It is im\u00adpossible, in my opinion, to say that the intention of the author of the pamphlet, or of the appellant, was to foment this opposition or to stir up ill-will against himself and the fellow members of his sect, certainly not to the point of disturbing constituted authority. To say that the advocacy of any belief becomes a seditious libel, if the publisher has reason to believe that he will be set upon by those with whom his views are unpopular, bears, in my opinion, its own refutation upon its face and finds no support in principle or authority. Any such view would elevate mob violence to a place of supremacy. Christianity itself, in any form, could hardly exist on the basis of such a view of the law. The Code itself protects places of worship from violence and disturbance and the decision in Beatty v. Gillbanks[33], establishes that the lawbreakers are those who resort to violence rather than those who exercise the right of free speech in advocating religious views however such views may be unacceptable to the former. The occasions of violence described in the pamphlet here in question were of a nature differing not at all from the situation described in the case just mentioned.\nI conclude, therefore, subject to one aspect of the matter to be mentioned, that there was no evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed, could reasonably infer a sedi\u00adtious intention on the part of the appellant. How far short the pamphlet falls of that set forth by Fitzgerald J. in Sullivan's case already cited, needs no amplification.\nAlthough little or no mention was made on behalf of the Crown of any reflection in the pamphlet upon the courts or the administration of justice in the province as bringing it within a proper definition of the offence charged, the matter should be referred to.\nIn Russell 9th Ed. p. 241, the author states that public attacks on courts of justice have in some instances been treated as a form of sedition. He refers to O'Connell v. R.[34]; R. v. Gordon[35]; R. v. Collins[36]. On the other hand, the writer in 85 Solicitor's Journal 251, says that \"old cases in which reflections on judges have been punished are in reality cases of contempt of court and are no pre\u00adcedent for the crime of sedition.\"\nIn The King v. Almon[37], certain libellous passages upon the Court of King's Bench and the Chief Justice were made the subject of contempt proceedings. In McLeod v. St. Aubyn[38], a similar case, Lord Morris refers to committals for contempt of this character as having become obsolete in England, the courts being satisfied to leave to public opinion attacks or comments derogatory or scandalous to them. However, in Regina v. Gray[39], and in R. v. New Statesman[40], convictions were had for contempt in respect of such statements.\nAt the present time, therefore, in England, matter of the character here in question, if made the subject of criminal process at all, appears to be treated as contempt of court rather than as seditious libel. Such matter may, of course, be regarded from the standpoint of seditious libel if intention of the necessary character be established. A definition set forth in Vol. IX of Halsbury's Laws of England at 302, so far as relevant on this aspect of the matter, is:\nA seditious intention is an intention\u2011\n(1) to bring into hatred or contempt, or to excite disaffection against ... the administration of justice, to which I would venture to add, \"the end and purpose being to defeat its functioning.\" In O'Connell v. The Queen[41], for instance, a case of conspiracy, the 8th count includes the following:\nwith the intent to induce Her Majesty's subjects to withdraw the adjudica\u00adtion of their differences with and claims upon each other from the cog\u00adnizance of the said tribunals by law established, and to submit the same to the judgment and determination of other tribunals to be constituted and contrived for that purpose.\nThe 9th count includes:\nand to assume and usurp the prerogative of the Crown in the establishment of courts for the administration of the law.\nIn considering this aspect of the matter, it is essential, in the present case, to keep in the forefront of one's mind what has already been said as to the burden of the pamph\u00adlet, and the pamphlet itself should be read as a whole. It does not speak generally of the administration of justice in the province, nor of the courts generally, and the refer\u00adences to the courts are bracketed with references to the local legislative bodies and the local police in their attitudes and conduct towards the sect of Jehovah's Witnesses.\nEverything put forward by the writer to the charge of these bodies, like all other matter of which the pamphlet complains, is lumped under the heading, \"Hateful Perse\u00adcution of Christians.\" This is but one aspect of the single protest running from the beginning to the end. The sect is identified by the author, in exclusive terms, with the servants of Christ. (It is one of the tenets of these people that they alone are the custodians of Christian truth.) The argument is that the conduct complained of, because it is directed against His servants, can be motivated only by hate for Him, notwithstanding what may be said to the contrary by those who are regarded 'as persecutors. All of this leads up to the plea, with which the pamphlet con\u00adcludes, for the study of God's Word, the Bible, by those whose conduct is complained of, and if studied, love for Christ will replace the hatred, with a consequent cessation of the causes of complaint. Whatever might be the result as establishing contempt of court if the expressions with regard to the courts could be singled out from the criticisms of the other persons and agencies with which the pamphlet deals, such a course is not possible in the present case. The complaint is one and indivisible. As it is abundantly plain, in my opinion, for the reasons already given, that the intention behind the portions of the pamphlet to which I have referred earlier in this judgment is to obtain cessation of the conduct complained of, it is not possible to ascribe a different motive to the statements with reference to the courts. There is therefore no basis for ascribing to the author or publisher of the pamphlet an intention to defeat the functioning of the administration of justice, without which it cannot be seditious.\nThe Code, in s. 133(a), expressly provides that\nNo one shall be deemed to have a seditious intention only because he intends in good faith\n(b) to point out errors or defects in ... the administration of justice; or to excite His Majesty's subjects to attempt to procure, by lawful means, the alteration of any matter in the state; or\n(c) to point out, in order to their removal, matters which are producing or have a tendency to produce feelings of hatred and ill-will between different classes of His Majesty's subjects.\nFor the reasons given, it is not possible to construe the pamphlet as evidencing any intention other than that which I have already described, and as there was no affirmative evidence on the point outside the pamphlet, the offence charged failed as a matter of evidence. As a necessary result, the question of good faith, a matter normally for the jury, does not arise, and the pamphlet falls within what is, by the statute, expressly excluded from the realm of that which is seditious.\nI would therefore allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct an acquittal.\nESTEY, J.:\u2011This is an appeal under sec. 1023 of the Criminal Code on questions of law raised in the dissenting opinions of the learned Judges in the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) of the Province of Quebec[42]. The appel\u00adlant was convicted of seditious libel in that he did on or about the 11th of December, 1946, at. St. Joseph \"dans le district de Beauce,\" distribute a pamphlet entitled \"La haine ardente du Qu\u00e9bec pour Dieu, pour le Christ, et pour la libert\u00e9, est un sujet de honte pour tout le Canada.\" Upon appeal this conviction was affirmed, Chief Justice Letourneau and Mr. Justice Galipeault dissenting.\nThe pamphlet consists of four pages entitled as aforesaid which the appellant admitted he had read and distributed. The main issue is, therefore, whether the appellant had a seditious intention in distributing and thereby publishing the pamphlet.\nThere were several points raised in the dissenting opinions but it will be sufficient to confine the discussion to two of them, namely, that the learned trial Judge in charging the jury (a) did not sufficiently define \"seditious intention\", (b) did not adequately explain to the jury the place and meaning of \"reasonable doubt.\"\nA \"seditious libel\" is defined in sec. 133 of the Criminal Code, the material part of which reads:\n133. Seditious words are words expressive of a seditious intention.\n2. A seditious libel is a libel expressive of a seditious intention.\nA \"seditious intention\" is not defined in either sec. 133 or in any other part of the Code and we must therefore look to the common law. It will there be found that the definition in Stephen's \"Digest of the Criminal Law\", 5th ed., p. 70, and described by 'the commissioners who pre-pared the draft of the English Code to be \"as accurate a statement of the existing law as we can make\", is generally accepted.\nThis is set out in sec. 102 of the Draft Code:\nA seditious intention is an intention to bring into hatred or contempt, or to excite disaffection against the person of Her Majesty, or the Government and Constitution of the United Kingdom or of any part of it as by law established, or either House of Parliament, or the administra\u00adtion of justice; or to excite Her Majesty's subjects to attempt to procure otherwise than by lawful means the alteration of any matter in Church or State by law established; or to raise discontent or disaffection amongst Her Majesty's subjects; or\nto promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of such subjects:\nProvided that no one shall be deemed to have a seditious intention only because he intends in good faith to show that Her Majesty has been misled or mistaken in her measures; or\nto point out errors or defects in the Government or Constitution of the United Kingdom or of any part of it as by law established, or in the administration of justice, with a view to the reformation of such alleged errors or defects; or to excite Her Majesty's subjects to attempt to procure by lawful means the alteration of any matter in Church or State by law established; or to point out in order to their removal matters which are producing or have a tendency to produce feelings of hatred and ill-will between different classes of Her Majesty's subjects,\nSeditious words are words expressive of or intended to carry into execution or to excite others to carry into execution a seditious intention.\nWhile the foregoing definition has never been enacted as part of our Criminal Code, the proviso was enacted in our first Code in 1892 as part of sec. 123 (S. of C. 1892, c. 29) and was deleted by an amendment in 1919 'and re-enacted in 1930 and is now sec. 133A (S. of C. 1930, c. 11, s. 2).\nThe learned trial Judge did not discuss a \"seditious intention\" in the terms of or in terms similar to those in the foregoing definition more than to say that a seditious intention is one \"to provoke feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of His Majesty's subjects,\" and expressed it in French as follows:\n... le libelle s\u00e9ditieux c'est la publication ou la distribution d'un pamphlet, ou d'un \u00e9crit injurieux, blessant, et qui peut provoquer de la haine et de la discorde parmi les diff\u00e9rentes classes de sujets de Sa Majest\u00e9.\nHowever vague and indefinite the words \"ill-will and hostility\" may be when read as part of the foregoing defi\u00adnition of sedition, they are certainly more so when, as in this case, they were stated to the jury as separate and apart therefrom.\nCave, J. in Rex v. Burns[43], referred to the foregoing definition as somewhat vague and general and particularly that portion reading \"ill-will and hostility between different classes of Her Majesty's subjects.\" This vague and general character is further emphasized in \"Law of the Constitu\u00adtion\", Dicey, 9th ed., p. 244, where, after pointing out that the law permits publication of statements indicating \"the Crown has been misled, or that the government has committed errors, ... and, in short, sanctions criticism of public affairs which is bona fide intended to recommend the reform of existing institutions by legal methods,\" the learned author concludes:\nBut any one will see at once that the legal definition of a seditious libel might easily be so used as to check a great deal of what is ordinarily considered allowable discussion, and would if rigidly enforced be incon\u00adsistent with prevailing forms of political agitation. The foregoing emphasizes the importance of intention and the necessity of a trial Judge explaining to a jury, in such a case as here, the meaning of \"intention to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes\" of His Majesty's subjects as an essential in the offence of sedition.\nIn determining whether a seditious intention is present in a particular case, the language of Fitzgerald, J. in Rex v. Sullivan[44], adopted by Cave, J. in Rex v. Burns, (supra), is pertinent:\nSedition has been described as disloyalty in action, and the law considers as seditious all those practices which have for their object to excite discontent or disaffection, to create public disturbances, or to lead to civil war; to bring into hatred or contempt the sovereign or the government, the laws or constitution of the realm, and generally all endeavours to promote public disorder.\nStephen's \"History of the Criminal Law of England\" Vol. 2, p. 375:\nIn one word, nothing short of direct incitement to disorder and violence is a seditious libel.\nRex v. Burns, (supra), and other authorities rather indicate that an intention to incite something less than violence is sufficient, and that the offence of sedition is committed if it be established that the parties charged intentionally incited ill-will and hostility between different classes of citizens in such a manner as may be likely to cause public disorder or disturbance. It will be recog\u00adnized that one may freely and forcefully express his views within the limits defined by the law. Those engaged in campaigns or controversies of a public nature may cause feelings of hatred and ill-will but it does not at all follow that those taking part therein and causing these feelings are acting with a seditious intention. The essential, with-out which there cannot be sedition, is the presence of a seditious intention as above defined and which is a fact to be determined on the evidence adduced in each case.\nThe defence contended that the appellant's conduct came within the provisions of sec. 133A (c) .\n133A. No one shall be deemed to have a seditious intention only because he intends in good faith,\u2011\n(c) to point out, in order to their removal, matters which are pro\u00adducing or have a tendency to produce feelings of hatred and ill-will between different classes of His Majesty's subjects. The appellant's position is therefore that hatred and ill-will already existed between different classes in Quebec and that in the publication of this pamphlet he was only setting forth those matters which had and were producing hatred and ill-will between different classes with the inten\u00adtion, in good faith, that they might be removed.\nThe presence of these issues requires that the definition of sedition should have been explained and so related to the facts of this case that the jury would be assisted in understanding the issues and the relevant factors to be considered in arriving at their conclusions. With great respect the above quotation from the learned Judge's charge does not satisfy either of these requirements.\nI therefore agree with the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Galipeault that the charge of the learned trial Judge was under the circumstances inadequate.\nThen with respect to the contention that the learned trial Judge did not adequately charge the jury relative to the burden of proof and reasonable doubt, I am also in agreement with the learned Judges who dissented.\nThe learned trial Judge at the outset stated to the jury:\nD'autre part, si la Couronne n'a pas \u00e9tabli le bien fond\u00e9 de l'acte d'accusation, l'accus\u00e9 devra \u00eatre acquitt\u00e9.\nand in the course of his address stated:\nJ'en conclus donc, et sur ce point vous devez suivre ma direction, que la preuve de la Couronne a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e8te par le fait d'avoir produit le pamphlet et le fait d'en avoir prouv\u00e9 la distribution.\nThen referring to sec. 133A the learned Judge stated:\nCet amendement veut dire qu'il n'y a pas de libelle dans le cas o\u00f9 un accus\u00e9 prouve qu'il \u00e9tait de bonne foi.\nand also :\n... si vous croyez qu'un document de cette nature peut laisser croire \u00e0 nos canadiens de langue anglaise que dans la Province de Qu\u00e9bec, la justice n'est pas observ\u00e9e, que le clerg\u00e9 a le contr\u00f4le sur les tribunaux et enfin, qu'il y a dans la Province de Qu\u00e9bec une haine ardente pour le Christ, pour Dieu et pour la Libert\u00e9, dans ce cas l\u00e0, vous devez condamner Boucher.\nUp to that point the learned trial Judge had made no reference to reasonable doubt. Toward the end of his charge he called the attention of the jury to the request of counsel for the defence that they should be instructed to give the benefit of the doubt to the accused. He then explained that:\nDans toute action, dans toute offense, le juge doit toujours dire aux jur\u00e9s que s'il y a un doute, j'entends un doute raisonnable bas\u00e9 sur les faits, ils doivent en donner le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice \u00e0 l'accus\u00e9, mais il faut que ce doute soit s\u00e9rieux, non pas un doute bas\u00e9 sur la piti\u00e9. Dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, je ne vois pas sur quoi pourrait porter le doute.\nAgain at the conclusion of his address when counsel for the appellant asked that they be further instructed as to their duty with respect to reasonable doubt, the learned trial Judge stated:\nMessieurs les jur\u00e9s, si vous aviez un doute que ce document l\u00e0 ne soit s\u00e9ditieux, vous en donnerez le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du doute h l'accus\u00e9.\nIt was not then, nor had it been explained to the jury that the burden rested upon the Crown to prove the essentials of the crime and if upon the whole of the evidence they had any reasonable doubt they should find the accused not guilty. Instead of that, as would appear from the above quotation commencing \"si vous croyez\", the jury might well conclude that the proof of the Crown had been sufficient and that if they believed the pamphlet would lead those Canadians speaking the English language to believe as he stated in the above quotation they must find Boucher possessed a seditious intention. Further, referring to the question of good faith, the jury might well have erroneously concluded from the instruction given that the burden rested upon the accused. Under the circum\u00adstances of this case the learned trial Judge should have charged the jury in language to the effect that if upon the whole of the evidence, the language of the pamphlet as well as the oral evidence, they were not convinced beyond any reasonable doubt that the appellant had a seditious intention in distributing the pamphlet they should find him not guilty. Woolmington v. Director of Public Prose\u00adcutions[45]; Rex v. Steane[46].\nWith respect, the learned trial Judge did not adequately explain to the jury the position and effect of reasonable doubt. On the contrary he may have in effect taken the question entirely out of the hands of the jury by stating, just before concluding his address:\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause, je ne vois pas sur quoi pourrait porter le doute.\nThe jury having been misdirected, the question arises whether the conviction should be quashed and a new trial directed or the accused discharged.\nSec. 1024(1) reads as follows:\n1024. (1) The Supreme Court of Canada shall make such rule or order thereon, either in affirmance of the conviction or for granting a new trial, or otherwise, or for granting or refusing such application, as the justice of the case requires, and shall make all other necessary rules and orders for carrying such rule or order into effect.\nIn Manchuk v. The King[47], it was held that \"this Court has authority, not only to order a new trial, or quash the conviction and direct the discharge of the prisoner, but also to give the judgment which the Court of Appeal for Ontario was empowered to give in virtue of s. 1016(2).\" The same observation would apply to sec. 1014(3), where it is provided:\nSubject to the special provisions contained in the following sections of this Part, when the Court of Appeal allows an appeal against conviction it may,\u2011\n(a) quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered; or\n(b) direct a new trial; and in either case may make such other order as justice requires.\nWhere, apart from the evidence held inadmissible, there is evidence from which the jury may find the accused guilty a new trial was directed: Allen v. The King[48]. But where, apart from the evidence improperly admitted there is no evidence which in law would support a verdict this Court directed that the conviction be quashed and a verdict of acquittal directed: Schwartzenhauer v. Rex[49].\nIt is therefore important to determine whether there was any evidence which in law would support a verdict of guilty which in this case would include a finding that the appellant in distributing this pamphlet acted with a seditious intention.\nThe Crown asked the jury to find the intention of the accused from the language of this four-page pamphlet. Nine excerpts from it were specifically embodied in the indictment. These, however, cannot be read separate and apart, but rather their meaning and effect must be deter-mined by reading and construing them in relation to the statements in the pamphlet as a whole.\nThe pamphlet is entitled, as already stated, \"La haine ardente du Qu\u00e9bec, pour Dieu, pour le Christ, et pour la libert\u00e9, est un sujet de honte pour tout le Canada.\" In the first paragraph the reader is requested to \"calmly and soberly and with clear mental faculties reason on the evidence presented in support of the above-headlined indictment.\" Then follows a recitation of facts and cir\u00adcumstances in support of the conclusions that the wit\u00adnesses of Jehovah are ill-treated and their freedom to worship according to the tenets of their religion denied; and that this condition exists because members' of the judiciary, police and groups of citizens are directed and controlled by the priests of the Roman Catholic 'Church. All of which the pamphlet declares to be contrary to the principles of Christianity and that \"such blind course will lead to the ditch of 'destruction. To avoid it turn from following men and traditions, and study and follow the Bible's teaching; that was Jesus' advice.\" This is the appeal made to all who read this pamphlet. It does not disclose an intention, nor reading the pamphlet as a whole can it be concluded that it is calculated to incite persons or classes of persons to acts or conduct leading to public disorder or disturbance. On the contrary, the pamphlet stresses the view that if the plea therein contained is acted upon the existent ill-will and hatred will disappear and the interference complained of will no longer exist. In these circumstances it is difficult to conclude that the appellant in distributing and publishing this pamphlet was doing so with a seditious intention.\nWe are not, however, left in this ease with respect to a seditious intention to the construction of the pamphlet alone. The appellant gave evidence on his own behalf. He explained that he was a minister of the witnesses of Jehovah, that hatred and ill-will already existed against Jehovah's Witnesses and that he had read the pamphlet and distributed it, as he explained:\nR. Dans le d\u00e9sir de faire connaitre les choses qu'il y a dans le pamphlet pour faire transformer les pers\u00e9cutions pass\u00e9es contre les t\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah pour que tous les gens de bonne volont\u00e9 connaissent les choses ... pas pour soulever de la haine ou pour soulever du trouble comme sont venus le dire les t\u00e9moins qu'il n'y avait pas au de soul\u00e8vement.\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nQ. Quand vous avez distribu\u00e9 cela, dans quel dessein \u00e9tait-ce?\nR. Dans le dessein que les gens verraient que le monde apr\u00e8s avoir pris connaissance de ce qu'il y a dans ce pamphlet voit le gouverne-ment et que les autorit\u00e9s prennent Ies moyens pour reformer des choses et qu'il n'y ait plus de pers\u00e9cutions, c'\u00e9tait justement dans ce dessein l\u00e0 pour que les hommes de bonne volont\u00e9 voient pour pr\u00eacher la paix et demeurent en paix, tandis que vous les voyez parler de haine tout le temps.\nThe appellant specifically denied that he had any inten\u00adtion of creating public disorder; on the contrary he stated that he desired to establish peace between the Roman Catholics and the witnesses of Jehovah. He stated:\n... je l'ai \u00e9tudi\u00e9, je l'ai lu et j'ai vu des faits.\nApart from this general declaration, he deposed that it was his own child, eleven years of age, referred to in the pamphlet who, because of her religious views, was expelled from her school.\nThe learned trial Judge in the course of his charge suggested that the distribution of this pamphlet was a ludicrous or strange way to effect a reconciliation. The conduct of the appellant may not only, in the opinion of the learned trial Judge, but of many others, be ludicrous or strange. That, however, is quite apart from the ques\u00adtion whether the appellant had, upon the whole of the evidence, a seditious intention.\nThe good faith of the appellant in distributing this pamphlet was directly in issue under sec. 133A(c). He, in the course of his evidence as above indicated, adopted as true the statements in the pamphlet. The truth of the pamphlet is not a defence to a charge of sedition but if the facts set out in the pamphlet are untrue, evidence to that effect would have gone far to have shown the appel\u00adlant did not act in good faith. No such evidence was adduced. The learned trial Judge himself observed in the course of his address:\nNous n'approuvons pas ces actes qui peuvent \u00eatre commis contre les t\u00e9moins de J\u00e9hovah, mais vous pouvez vous demander s'ils ne peuvent pas s'expliquer.\nThe conduct on the part of any group in Canada which denies to or even interferes with the right of the members of any religious body to worship is a matter of public concern. The pamphlet, in the conception of the appellant as he deposed, discusses such an interference. He pledged his oath that it sets forth facts and circumstances which establish this interference with repect to the rights of the Witnesses of Jehovah to worship in the Province of Quebec and that hatred and ill-will exist toward them. He believed the plea set forth in the pamphlet would remove that hatred and ill-will and the interference would cease. He therefore, as he deposed, in good faith and for that purpose published and distributed the pamphlet. No evidence was introduced to contradict any of these factors and therefore the evidence here adduced brings this posi\u00adtion of the appellant within the provisions of sec. 133A, already quoted.\nThe facts as set forth in the pamphlet may be inaccur\u00adately stated, even incorrect and the comments unjustified. The statements in it may be objectionable, even repugnant to some and provoke ill-will and hatred. That, however, is not sufficient. It still remains to be proved as a fact that the accused acted with a seditious intention. Under sec. 133A that intention does not exist if the appellant's conduct was within that section and he was acting in good faith. The evidence of good faith on behalf of the defence is consistent with the intent and purpose of the pamphlet as therein expressed and no evidence has been adduced to the contrary. The onus rested upon the Crown through-out to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused acted with a seditious intention and this record does not disclose any evidence that would properly sustain a verdict that the accused possessed such an intention.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a judgment and verdict of acquittal directed to be entered. I would clarify my previous reasons by adding that a seditious intention must be founded upon evidence of incitement to violence, public disorder or unlawful conduct directed against His Majesty or the institutions of the Government.\nThis intention, which the pamphlet makes plain, I have reviewed in my previous reasons. The judges, members of the Legislature and the police were all criticized upon the same basis and with the same intention. We are here concerned only with the offence of sedition. With great respect, I am of the opinion that in all cases the intention to incite violence or public disorder or unlawful conduct against His Majesty or an institution of the State is essential. This pamphlet, particularly when considered with due regard to the provisions of section 133A, as I previously stated, does not disclose any evidence that would properly support a verdict that the accused possessed a seditious intention.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a judgment and verdict of acquittal directed to be entered.\nLOCKE J.:\u2011The charge upon which the appellant was found guilty was that of publishing a seditious libel. It is conceded on behalf of the Crown that the conviction must be quashed clue to errors in the judge's charge, the nature of which it is unnecessary under these circum\u00adstances to discuss. For the Crown it is contended that a new trial should be ordered; for the accused that as there was no evidence of a seditious intention on his part his acquittal should be directed.\nThat the accused published the pamphlet in question to various persons was proven. If there is any evidence that this was done with a seditious intention, it must be found in the document itself. In so far as it may be said to indicate a seditious intent as reflecting upon the administration of justice, it reads as follows:\nWhat of her judges that impose heavy fines and prison sentences against them (Jehovah's witnesses) and heap abusive language upon them and deliberately follow a malicious policy of again and again post\u00adponing cases to tie up tens of thousand of dollars in exorbitant bails and keep hundred of cases pending? and:\nHere are some instances revealing Quebec's hatred for God's Word as well as for freedom: In Hull, E. M. Taylor, septuagenarian, of Namur, Quebec, was sentenced to seven days in prison for having distributed Bibles without a permit. In Recorder's Court his attempted explanation was curtly ended by the recorder's ordering him off to prison. Two of Jehovah's witnesses were arrested for distributing free a Bible pamphlet, charged with sedition, and sentenced to 60 days imprisonment or $300 fine. All the French Canadian courts were so under priestly thumbs that they affirmed the infamous sentence and it was not until the case reached the Supreme Court of Canada that judgment was reversed.\nand:\nBut regardless of this decision (an Order of McKinnon, J.) the lawless arrests of Jehovah's witnesses continue almost daily in Montreal and district, and in the Recorder's 'Courts they are subjected to abusive tirades. For example, in June of 1946 Recorder Leonce Plante denounced the witnesses as a \"bunch of crazy nuts,\" set cash bail as high as $200 and threatened that if some witnesses came before him again bail would be $1,000. At present, 1946, there are about 800 charges stacked up against Jehovah's witnesses in Greater Montreal, with property bail now involved being $100,000 and cash bail more than $2,000. Court cases are adjourned time after time, to inconvenience and increase expense for Jehovah's witnesses. To have their cases heard, during one short period the witnesses had to appear on 38 different occasions.\nA further reference to the courts reads:\nWhy, Catholic domination .of Quebec courts is so complete that in the courtrooms the imagery of the crucifix takes the place of the British Coat of Arms, which appears in other courts throughout the Dominion.\nbut this, in my opinion, cannot be said, in itself or when read together with the remainder of the pamphlet, to afford any evidence of a seditious intent. The pamphlet contains in addition charges that the Legislature has passed laws that are unfair to Jehovah's Witnesses and of misconduct on the part of the Provincial Police and of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, but it is not contended that these are libels published with a seditious intent.\nWhile in some jurisdictions as in India and the Gold Coast seditious conduct or a seditious intention have been defined by statute, this has not been done in Canada. Section 133 of the Criminal Code declares that seditious words are words expressive of a seditious intention and that a seditious libel is a libel expressive of a seditious intention, while section 133(a) declares that no one shall be deemed to have a seditious intention in certain defined circumstances. When the Code was drafted in 1892 and introduced into Parliament it contained a clause defining a seditious intention in terms similar to those contained in section 102 of the Criminal Code which was drafted but never adopted in England and which accepted Stephen's definition, but this was rejected in the House of Commons.. While the definition of a seditious intention given in the current edition of Stephen's Digest, or that of sedition given in Russell on 'Crimes, have been taken in various Canadian cases as accurately expressing the common law, so far as I am aware the authorities said to justify these definitions have not been closely examined to determine whether they justify these respective statements of the law nor, so far as I can ascertain has it been considered whether, in view of the alteration of the respective func\u00adtions of the Sovereign and the elected representatives of the people since the days preceding the passing of the Bill of Rights in 1688, the old authorities are to be accepted as now binding.\nSir James Fitzjames Stephen's definition in substantially its present form was first enunciated by him in the first edition of his Digest of the Criminal Law of England published in 1877. In the current edition of that work the definition, in so far as it is relevant to the present question, reads:\nA seditious intention is an intention to bring into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection against the administration of justice.\nThe matters are stated disjunctively and must be con\u00adsidered separately. The words used are \"hatred or con-tempt against the administration of justice,\" which must necessarily, I think, include the manner of its administra\u00adtion by individual judges or others discharging judicial functions. Assuming this and the accuracy of the defini\u00adtion, in my opinion, the first three of the quotations from the pamphlet, without more, afford evidence proper to be submitted to a jury of an intention to excite contempt or hatred of the individuals referred to, or of the manner in which justice had been administered by them in the particular matters referred to. If, on the other hand, to Stephen's definition should be added \"with the intention of inciting resistance to or disobedienice of the law or the authority of the state,\" which, I think, more correctly defines the offence, I think the pamphlet affords no evidence.\nIn Stephen's History of the Criminal Law of England (vol. 2, p. 301), the learned author states that the first definite instance he had found of a law relating to a quasi-seditious offence was a provision of the first Statute of Westminster passed in the year 1275 (Edw. 1, cap. 34) which provided a penalty for the publishing of false news or tales whereby discord may grow between the King and his people or \"the great men of the realm.\" In the case de Libellis Famosis[50], the reason for Sir Edward Coke's opinion that a libel against a magistrate or public person is a greater offence than one against a private person is thus stated: (p. 255)\n... for it concerns not only the breach of the peace, but also the scandal of government; for what greater scandal of government can there be than to have corrupt or wicked magistrates to be appointed and con\u00adstituted by the King to govern his subjects under him? And greater imputation to the state cannot be than to suffer such corrupt men to sit in the sacred seat of justice, or to have any meddling in or concerning the administration of justice.\nCoke used the three expressions \"the King\", \"the government\" and \"the state\", and at a time when the judges held office at the King's pleasure. This view of the law appears to have been adopted in the case of libellous statements upon those holding other offices in the gift of the Queen as in Udall's case[51], where a Puritan Minister was charged with having published a libel upon certain of the bishops: the report shows that the judges considered that publishing a libel with a malicious intent against the bishops regarding the exercise of powers vested in them by the Queen was a seditious libel upon Her Majesty and the state and Udall was condemned to death. The court apparently proceeded upon the same ground in Rex v. Darby[52]. At this time it is clear that, at least in the mind of King James II, the judges were his nominees expected to do his bidding. In a note to the report of the trial of The Seven Bishops[53], it appears that following the acquittal of the bishops the King dismissed Holloway and Powell JJ., each of whom had expressed the opinion that there was no libel \"and would have meditated some further severity if his following reign would have allowed it.\" In that view of the position of the judges there was perhaps some foundation for a contention that .a reflection upon their honesty or capacity was a reflection upon the King. I think the change that took place following the accession to the Throne of William and Mary in 1688 bears upon the present question. While it was not so declared in the Bill of Rights, from the time William III came to the Throne the commissions of the judges were by their terms to endure during their good behaviour and not merely at the King's pleasure, and this was expressly pro\u00advided by the \"Act for the Limitation of the Crown and Better Securing the Rights and Liberties of the Subject\" (12-13 Wm. III, cap. 2). In effect the change brought about by the revolution of 1688 was to transfer the sovereignty from the King to the House of Commons. While the change came gradually the executive power of the Crown was by degrees transferred to what has been termed \"a board of control chosen by the legislature out of persons whom it trusts and knows to rule the nation (Taswell-Langmead's Const. Hist. 10th Ed. p. 668). While the personal influence of the sovereign over the administra\u00adtion of affairs continued to be exercised in varying degrees between the revolution of 1688 and the passing of the Reform Bill in 1832, when it may properly be said that the control of the affairs of the nation was finally assumed by the elected representatives of the people, parliamentary government by means of a ministry, nominally the King's servants but really representing the will of the party majority for the time being in the House of Commons, was fully and finally established under George I and George II. During Lord North's administration, however, from 1770 to 1782, the personal influence of George III was constantly exerted, he reserving to himself all of the patronage and nominating and promoting the English and Scottish judges, appointing and translating bishops and dispensing other preferments in the Church (May Const. Hist.; i.58). An examination of the reports of trials for seditious conduct during the 18th century indicates a gradual change in the grounds upon which they were based. While in R. v. Tutchin[54], which was a proceeding for publishing a seditious libel upon the Ministers of the Crown and upon the Navy, Holt, L.C.J. said that it had always been looked upon as a crime to \"procure animosities as to the management of\" the government, and in R. v. Francklin[55], where the charge was of seditiously contriving to traduce the administration of His Majesty's government and Ministers of state and to bring \"His present Majesty in his admini\u00adstration of the government into suspicion or ill-opinion of his liege subjects,\" the Attorney-General who prosecuted fell back on Coke's statement of the law as to a libel upon a public person and Lord Raymond, C.J. made it clear that he considered the reflections made upon the officers of the government were seditious as reflections upon the King, the charge against Lord George Gordon in 1787 did not proceed upon that footing. The first of the two indictments against Gordon charged him, inter alia, with intending to excite a general disaffection among His Majesty's subjects towards the administration of justice and the Attorney-General argued that his object in writing the petition in question was to call upon the prisoners to resist the execution of the laws that they had broken and to provoke His Majesty's subjects to rise in defence of the injured persons.\nIn Rex v. Cobbett[56], the accused was charged with publishing certain libels on the Earl of Hardwicke, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Redesdale, Lord High Chan\u00adcellor, the Honourable Francis Osborne, one of the justices of the Court of King's Bench in Ireland and Alexander Marsden, an Under-Secretary in the office of the Chief Secretary of the Lord Lieutenant. The prosecution arose out of the publication in England by Cobbett of a number of letters which were thereafter shown to have been written by the Honourable Robert Johnson, a justice of the Court of Common Pleas in Ireland. These contained, in addition to charges against the capacity of the Lord Lieutenant, statements reflecting upon both the capacity and honesty of Lord Redesdale and Osborne, J. and statements attack\u00ading the conduct of the government in Ireland and of certain officers of the government. Of the six counts in the indictment two contained allegations that the publications were seditious. The second charged in part the publication of divers:\nscandalous, malicious and seditious matters and things of and concerning the said part of the said United Kingdom and the persons employed by our said Lord the King in the administration of the government of the said pant of the said United Kingdom and of and concerning the said Charles Osborne, so being such justice as aforesaid and the said Alexander Marsden, so being such under-secretary as aforesaid.\nand the fourth charged the accused with:\nunlawfully, maliciously and seditiously devising and intending as last aforesaid and also further unlawfully, maliciously and seditiously devising and intending to traduce, defame and vilify the said John Lord Redesdale, so being such chancellor and privy councillor.\nLord Ellenborough in addressing the jury said in part: (p. 50)\nThe question for your consideration is whether this paper is such as would be injurious to the individuals and whether it is calculated to be injurious to the particular interest of the country. It is no new doctrine that if a publication be calculated to alienate the affections of the people by bringing the government into disesteem, whether the expedient be by ridicule or obloquy, the person so conducting himself is exposed to the inflictions of the law. It is a crime. It has ever been considered as a crime; whether it be wrapped in one form or in another. The case of the King v. Tutchin decided in the time of lord chief justice Holt has removed all ambiguity from this question; and although at the period when that case was decided great political contentions existed, the matter was not again brought before the judges by any application for a new trial.\nConcluding he said: (p. 54)\nIf you are of opinion that the publications are hurtful to the individuals or to the government you will find the defendant guilty.\nIt would appear that if Lord Ellenborough considered that the matters referred to in the second and fourth counts amounted to seditious conduct, and this does not appear to me to be clear, it was not upon the ground that to impute misconduct to the judges was a reflection upon the Xing but rather that they were so as calculated to alienate the affections of the people from the government or to bring it into \"disesteem.\" While in R. v. Hart and White[57], the accused were charged with unlawfully and maliciously devising and intending to bring the administra\u00adtion of justice in England into hatred and contempt by publishing a libel, the charge was not of seditious conduct and while Grose, J. in charging the jury said that the letters were \"most wicked, gross and abominable libels\" he did not suggest that they were seditious.\nIn Stephen's History (p. 373) it is said that since the Reform Bill of 1832 prosecutions for seditious libel have been so rare in England that they can be said practically to have ceased. I am unable to find any reported case in England since Cobbett's case in 1804 in which words or writings calculated or intended to bring either the admini\u00adstration of justice by the courts, or its administration by partcular judges, into contempt have been made the basis of proceedings for seditious conduct. There are, however, three cases originating in Ireland: O'Connell v. R.[58]; R. v. Sullivan[59] and The Queen v. McHugh[60]. The charge against Daniel O'Connell and others was that of seditious conspiracy and the trials took place at a time of great political unrest in Ireland. While this case is referred to by Stephen as one of the authorities for his definition of a seditious intention it does not, in my humble opinion, support the portion of that definition which we are now considering. The charge in O'Connell's case was of seditious conspiracy and there were eleven counts in the indictment. The proceedings were initiated in the Court of Queen's Bench in Ireland and the question of the sufficiency of the indictment was considered in the House of Lords where the opinion of Chief Justice Tindal and six of the judges was asked by the Law Lords in advance of their decision in the matter. As pointed out by Chief Justice Tindal each count of the indictment charged one conspiracy or unlawful agreement and no more and, in so far as the conspiracy \"to diminish the confidence of Her Majesty's subjects in the tribunals duly and lawfully con\u00adstituted for the administration of justice\" was included in the counts other than the tenth, it was included with other acts as together constituting the offence said to be described in the count. The charge was that the accused did \"unlawfully, maliciously and seditiously combine, conspire, confederate and agree with each other\" in the manner alleged in the various counts. If any support is to be found for this part of Stephen's definition in this case, it must be derived from what was said as to the tenth count which differed from the eighth and ninth in that it charged as an offence to conspire to bring into hatred and disrepute the tribunals established by law in Ireland for the admini\u00adstration of justice and to diminish the confidence of Her Majesty's subjects in Ireland in the administration of the law, since here that aspect of the matter is divorced from other charges of unlawful acts. Tindal, C.J. said in part that an agreement by various persons to raise discontent and disaffection among people and to stir up hatred and ill-will between different classes and to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility in Ireland against the people of England was an illegal act, but says nothing to the effect that such conduct was seditious. As to the alleged con\u00adspiracy to bring the general administration of the law into disrepute and diminish the confidence of Her Majesty's subjects in it, he said that such an agreement was \"to effect purposes in manifest violation of the law.\" Since the charge as to each of the counts was that the accused did unlawfully, maliciously and seditiously conspire and since to conspire together to commit any offence punishable at law undoubtedly amounted to a criminal conspiracy and was an illegal act, this does not appear to advance the matter. Lord Denman (p. 364) who said that he did not agree with the judges in thinking that there were only two objectionable counts and that there were other counts open to very serious objection said in part:\nI should be sorry to preclude myself by anything which I may now say from giving a judicial opinion against counts so generally stated and charging as an unlawful act a conspiracy to excite disaffection with the existing tribunals for the purpose of procuring a better system. I am. by no means clear that there is anything illegal involved in exciting disapprobation of the courts of law for the purpose of having other courts substituted more cheap, efficient and satisfactory.\nLord Campbell (p. 403) who said that he had no doubt that there were various good counts in the indictment said that:\nA conspiracy to effect an unlawful purpose, or to effect a lawful purpose by unlawful means, is, by the common law of England, an indictable offence; and it is fit that, if several persons deliberately plot mischief to .an individual or to the State, they should be liable to punishment, although they may have done no act in execution of their scheme.\nAs to the subject matter of the tenth count he said without referring to the language of the count that:\nA conspiracy generally to bring into discredit the administration of justice in the country, with a view to alienate the people from the government, would certainly be a misdemeanour.\nHe pointedly refrained from saying that to speak in a manner intended or calculated to bring the administra\u00adtion of justice into disrepute simpliciter was seditious con-duct or that to conspire with others to do so amounted to a seditious conspiracy.\nThe second of the Irish cases is R. v. Sullivan and Pigott[61], where the charge was seditious libel of Her Majesty's government. In a lengthy charge to the grand jury Fitz\u00adgerald, J. after saying that sedition is a crime against society, nearly allied to that of treason, attempted to define the offence and in the course of doing so said that: (p. 45)\nThe objects of sedition generally are to induce discontent and insurrection, .and stir up opposition to the Government, and bring the administration of justice into contempt; and the very tendency of sedition is to incite the people to insurrection and rebellion.\nThe charges followed by a year the uprising in Ireland as a result of the Fenian conspiracy and the learned judge said further (p. 47):\nAssuming you find the articles to be seditious-that they were published with the intent laid in. the indictment-namely, to spread, stir up, and excite disaffection and sedition amongst the Queen's subjects, to excite hatred and contempt towards Her Majesty's Government and administration, to encourage, foster, and keep alive the Fenian con\u00adspiracy, to spread information and intelligence respecting that con\u00adspiracy amongst its members in this country, and to keep them and other evil-disposed persons well informed of the acts and proceedings of their brother conspirators in America\nthey should find a bill and, having said this, proceeded to say that while every man is free to write as he thinks fit he must not under the pretence of freedom \"bring justice into contempt or embarrass its functions.\" Since these statements were made in a charge to a grand jury the learned judge did not refer to authorities and there is thus no indication as to what he relied upon to support the statement last referred to. My own view is that he intended his last remark to be read in conjunction with what he had said earlier and accordingly meant that to endeavour to promote public disorder or defiance of the law by bring\u00ading the administration of justice into contempt was seditious conduct: if he did not mean this, I think, with respect, that the statement was inaccurate as a statement of the common law.\nThe last of the Irish cases to which I have referred is The Queen v. McHugh[62], where the accused was charged with publishing a wicked, scandalous and malicious libel of and concerning the administration of justice, intending to bring it into contempt and to scandalize and vilify William Drennan Andrews (Andrews, J.) and, the jurors by whom a certain action had been tried. The indictment did not charge that the conduct was seditious but the court did not consider that this was necessary. O'Brien, L.C.J. adopted Stephen's definition regarding conduct intended to bring the administration of the law into contempt and said that while a judge in his judicial character should always welcome fair criticism of his judicial conduct, deliberate misconduct in his judicial character must not be imputed, and that to say of a judge that he was actuated by any other motive than a simple desire to arrive at the truth and to mete out justice impartially was seditious. Other authority for this sweeping statement is not given. Murphy, J. concurred with the Lord Chief Justice, Gibson, J. stated that an intent to bring the administration of justice into contempt is a seditious intent, Madden, J. agreed and referred to the charge to the jury by Grose, J. in R. v. Hart[63]. There, however, as above stated, the charge was not of publishing a seditious libel.\nThere are two reported cases in Canada in which it may be said that this part of Stephen's definition was applied. The first of these is R. v. Brodie and Barrett[64]. The case does not appear to have been otherwise reported and the decision in this Court which quashed the conviction on the ground that the indictment did not disclose any offence does not affect the matter under consideration. Brodie and others were charged, as parties to a seditious conspiracy. This was based upon their having distributed in the City of Quebec a number of pamphlets with what was said to have been a seditious intention. These pamphlets included extravagant charges against the clergy, \"big business\" and against practically every branch of the government which, it was said, was contaminated and improperly influenced, and said that there would be no peace so long as the unholy alliance of \"commercial and political oppressive power with hypocritical religion\" continued to exist. They con\u00adtained also other statements particularly offensive to the Protestant and Roman Catholic clergy. The charges made were so sweeping that they may well have been considered as including an attack upon the manner in which justice was administered. The learned judges of the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side) adopted Stephen's and Russell's statements as to what constituted seditious con-duct and, apparently considering that the pamphlets were really an attack against all organized authority, upheld the conviction.\nIn Duval v. R.[65], all the accused, also members of Jehovah's Witnesses, were charged with seditious con\u00adspiracy in connection with the distribution of pamphlets which contained, among other extravagant statements, the following:\nSatan has become the prince of the earth and humanity is in his grip; all human institutions are in his control; the church, the financial bodies, the political governments, the bar, the bench, have become corrupt and serve the purposes of Satan, who has blinded humanity.\nFollowing the decision of the Court in Brodie's case the conviction for conspiracy was sustained. It does not appear that in either of these cases in Quebec the question as to whether conduct designed to bring the administration of law into contempt without more was seditious was considered. In view of the nature of the other statements it was perhaps thought unnecessary to do so.\nWhile the charge in R. v. Burns et al[66], was not based upon words impugning the administration of justice or the conduct of judges or other judicial officers, Mr. Justice Cave in the course of his charge to the jury read Stephen's definition of a seditious intention and said that for every proposition there laid down there was to be found un-doubted authority. The charge against John Burns and the other accused, briefly stated, was of intending to incite insurrections, riots, tumults and breaches of the peace and to stir up hatred between different classes of the King's 'subjects and to prevent by force the execution of the laws of the realm and the preservation of the public peace. The approval expressed by Cave, J. of Stephen's definition must be considered, however, with further statements that he made to the jury such as (p. 359):\nThere is undoubtedly no question .at all, as the learned Attorney-General has said, of the right of meeting in public, and the right of free discussion is also perfectly unlimited, with the exception, of course, that it must not be used for the purpose of inciting to a breach of the peace or to a violation of the law.\nand further (p. 363) :\nIf you think that these defendants, if you trace from the whole matter laid before you that they had a seditious intention to incite the people to violence, to create public disturbances and disorder, then undoubtedly you ought to find them guilty.\nWhile in so far as the charge approved that portion of Stephen's definition relating to an intention to bring into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection against the administration of justice, the statement of Cave, J. is obiter, when the charge is read as a whole it appears to me to be properly construed as saying that such an intention is seditious if intended to incite a breach of the peace or a violation of the law.\nIf what was said by Fitzgerald, J. in Sullivan's case was not intended by him to bear the meaning I suggest, it must have been based on the view of the law expressed by Coke in 1606, by Holt, L.C.J. in Tutchin's case in 1704, and by Lord Ellenborough in Cobbett's case in 1804. The passage from Lord Holt's charge to the jury, referred to by Lord Ellenborough, as reported in 14 St. Tr. at p. 1128, reads:\nTo say that corrupt officers are appointed to administer affairs is certainly a reflection on the government. If people should not be called to account for possessing the people with an ill opinion of the government, no government can subsist. For it is very necessary for all governments that the people should have a good opinion of it. And nothing can be worse to any government, than to endeavour to procure animosities, as to the management of it; this has been always looked upon as a crime, and no government can be safe without it be punished. It is not a matter for surprise that there has been difficulty in defining an offence the nature of which in this and in other cases has been stated in such general terms. In Donogh's History and Law of Sedition (3rd Ed. p. 5) it is said that when the report of the Select Committee regarding the proposed amendments to the Penal Code for India was presented by Stephen in 1870, he said there was a very long history about seditious libel compiled from various authorities contained in Russell on Crime, that the law was \"very vaguely expressed\" and that he hoped that someone might soon reduce to a few short sentences the great mass of dicta on the subject. This he himself attempted to do seven years later in his Digest. Writing of this in his History of the Criminal Law pub\u00adlished in 1883 (p. 298) Stephen, after referring to the contrasting views of the position of the Sovereign, the one that he is the agent and servant of his people, the other that being the superior of his subjects and by the nature of his position presumably wise and good, the rightful ruler and guide of the whole population, it must necessarily follow that it is wrong to censure him openly, said (p. 300):\nThese are the extreme views each of which has had a considerable share in moulding the law of England with the practical result of pro\u00adducing the compromise which I have tried to express in the articles of my Digest. It has no claim to that quasi-mathematical precision, which even in the most careful writings is rarely, if ever, attainable, but I think it is sufficiently distinct to afford a practical guide to judges and juries in the discharge of duties which are now seldom imposed upon them. I will now attempt to sketch the history of the various legal controversies which have for the present ended in this compromise.\nI think when the cases are examined the sense in which the word \"compromise\" is intended is not clear since the portion of the definition we are now concerned with appears to be founded on the conception of the law stated as afore-said in Cobbett's case, which in turn appears to be con\u00adsistent with the view expressed by Sir Edward Coke in 1606.\nIn his charge to the jury in R. v. Lambert and Perry[67], Lord Ellenborough said that the prosecution treated the language complained of as a libel upon the person of the King and upon his administration of the government of the Kingdom and that if it meant that His Majesty during his reign had taken an erroneous view of the interests of the country and imputed nothing but honest error, he was not prepared to say that that of itself was libellous. If, however, it be assumed for the purpose of argument that to intend to reflect upon the wisdom or judgment of the occupant of the Throne by words or writings be a seditious intention, to impugn the honesty or capacity of a judge or of a recorder or of several of them cannot, in my opinion, be any evidence of such an intention. Judges of the Superior Courts in England, as in Canada, are appointed by patents from the Crown and hold office during good behaviour. While thus appointed in His Majesty's name, they have been for a very long time indeed chosen by the government in power, a Cabinet chosen from the elected representatives of the party holding the majority in Parlia\u00adment. In accordance with long established constitutional practice the occupant of the Throne, and in Canada his representative, acts on the advice of his Ministers and it appears to me quite impossible to suggest that a libel upon one chosen to administer justice in this manner can con\u00adceivably be considered as a reflection upon the Sovereign. If it were so in the case of the judges, it would presumably be so in the case of all persons holding offices under patents from the Crown upon the principle upon which Udall was convicted in the year 1590, such as certain of the dignitaries of the established Church in England and Ministers of His Majesty's Provincial governments in Canada. Is it to be said that to adversely criticize the conduct or impugn the motives of the occupants of such an office would evidence an intention to reflect in any manner upon the occupant of the Throne? In the case of the recorders in the Province of Quebec appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council under the provisions of the Cities and Towns Act (R.S.Q. 1941, c. 233, s. 643), it appears to me equally impossible to say that a reflection upon their honesty or capacity is a reflection upon the Sovereign. Assuming Coke's statement accurately declared the com\u00admon law of England at that time, the reason which formed its basis has disappeared with the changed status of the judges and the manner in which they are chosen and appointed and this is, in my opinion, no longer the law either in England or Canada: cessante ratione legis cessat ipsa lex.\nFor this reason, I think also it is error to say that at the present time to reflect upon the capacity or honesty of one or more judges or recorders in a manner calculated to bring them and the manner in which the law is administered by them into contempt is seditious as a reflection upon His Majesty's Ministers or the government responsible for their selection and appointment. Taswell-Langmead (10th Ed. p. 740), speaking of the period following the passing of the Bill of Rights, says that the press soon became the favourite instrument of party warfare and that each party when in power endeavoured to crush its opponents by prosecuting as seditious libels all publications which supported the opposition. There were from time to time up to the period shortly prior to 1832 some prose\u00adcutions of this nature in England but there have been, so far as I can find, none such since that date. The right of free public discussion upon all matters affecting the state and its government, subject only to the restraint imposed by the laws both civil and criminal as to defama\u00adtion, and in the case of the administration of justice to the law as to contempt of court, has long since become firmly established. It is the right of His Majesty's subjects to freely criticize the manner in which the government of the country is carried on, the conduct of those administer\u00ading the affairs of government and the manner in which justice is administered, subject to these restraints. The criminal law as to defamatory libel is declared in Canada in the Criminal Code. Section 317 defines a defamatory libel and section 324 declares that no one commits an offence by publishing any defamatory matter which he, on reasonable grounds, believes to be true and which is rele\u00advant to any subject of public interest, the public discus\u00adsion of which is for the public benefit. The existence of this right of public discussion is wholly inconsistent with a rule of law that judges or others administering justice or Ministers of the Crown are immune from criticism on the ground that to impugn their honesty or capacity is a reflection upon the government. It is very much too late in the day to say that \"if a publication be calculated to alienate the affections of the people by bringing the government into disesteem, whether the expedient be by ridicule or obloquy\" it is a crime.\nThe question remains whether it is accurate to say that \"a seditious intention is an intention to excite disaffection against the administration of justice\" as stated by Stephen. This, in my opinion, depends upon the meaning to be assigned to the word \"disaffection.\" The word is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as \"absence or alienation of affection or kindly feeling, dislike, hostility\u201d: and in a different sense \"political alienation or discontent; a spirit of disloyalty to the government or existing authority.\" When the Indian Penal Code was drafted in 1870 Stephen advised against defining the word, saying that it was difficult to define but impossible to mistake. Donogh (3rd Ed. p. 72) reports him as saying: \"and so courts of equity would not define fraud lest fraud were committed outside the definition.\" Only if disaffection be construed as meaning resistance to or disobedience of the law or the authority of the state is it accurate, in my opinion. The statements complained of in the present matter cannot be said to evidence any such intention.\nI concur in the opinion of my brother Kellock that that portion of Stephen's definition which declares that \"to intend to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of such subjects\" is a seditious intention, without more, is inadequate as a statement of the common law and I agree with his conclusion upon this aspect of the matter.\nI would allow this appeal, quash the conviction and direct the acquittal of the accused.\nThe dissenting judgment of Cartwright and Fauteux M. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2011On a consideration of all the evidence given at the trial of the appellant and of the charge to the jury of the learned trial judge, I am in agreement with, what I understand to be, the unanimous opinion of the court, that the conviction of the appellant must be set aside; and I think that the learned counsel for the Crown was right in his decision not to argue that it should be upheld. The question debated before us was as to whether we should order a new trial or direct a verdict of acquittal 'to be entered.\nNo relevant evidence tendered by the Crown appears to have been rejected and if, as the appellant contends, on the evidence in the record no jury properly instructed could reasonably have convicted him of the offence charged, it would not, I think, be proper to direct a new trial.\nThere was ample evidence in the record that the appel\u00adlant had read the pamphlet, which the Crown submits is a seditious libel, and had distributed copies to several persons. There is no evidence of a seditious intention on the part of the appellant except such as is furnished by the pamphlet itself. It is scarcely necessary to say that the words of a document published with knowledge of its contents may in themselves furnish ample evidence of a seditious intention.\nA great portion of the able arguments addressed to us was directed to the question whether the document was, on its face, capable of supporting the inference that it was intended to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility be\u00adtween different classes of His Majesty's subjects and if so whether such an intention, without more, is a seditious one. In my opinion it would have been open to the jury to infer from the words of the document that it was intended to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility be\u00adtween different classes of His Majesty's subjects; and if such intention is, of itself, a seditious intention it would, I think, be proper to direct a new trial as, while the question whether such an inference could be drawn would be for the Judge, the question whether it ought to be drawn would be for the jury.\nUndoubtedly several text-writers of high authority do give as one of several definitions of a seditious intention, the definition referred to above. To the definitions quoted in the reasons for judgment of other members of the court may be added that in Halsbury's Laws of England (2nd Edition) Volume 9, page 302: \"A seditious intention is an intention ... to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of such subjects.\"\nThe obvious objection to accepting this as a sufficient definition, unless we are bound by authority to do so, is that such acceptance would very seriously curtail the liberty of the press and of individuals to engage in dis\u00adcussion of any controversial topic. It is not easy to debate a question of public interest upon which strong and con\u00adflicting views are entertained without the probability of stirring up, to a greater or less degree, feelings of ill-will and hostility between the groups in disagreement.\nThe reasons of my brother Kellock bring me to the conclusion that the definition quoted above ought not to be accepted without qualification, and that before a writing can be held to disclose a seditious intention 'by reason of being calculated to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of His Majesty's subjects it must further appear that the intended, or natural and probable, consequence of such promotion of ill-will and hostility is to produce disturbance of or resistance to the authority of lawfully constituted government. I do not think that, on the evidence in the record in this case, a jury could properly find that the pamphlet in question was calculated to have such effect by reason of its tendency to promote such feelings of ill-will between classes. If the words of the pamphlet did not disclose any other sort of seditious inten\u00adtion I would not favour the ordering of a new trial.\nThere is, however, another definition of seditious intention found in many of the text-writers which in my opinion requires consideration, although comparatively little stress was laid upon it in argument.\nThe definition in Halsbury's Laws of England (2nd Edition) Vol. 9, page 302, commences as' follows:\nA seditious intention is an intention--(1) to bring into hatred or contempt, or to excite disaffection against the King or the Government and Constitution of the United Kingdom, or either House of Parliament, or the administration of justice.\nFor the purpose of considering its application to the case at bar this definition may be shortened to read, \"A seditious intention is an intention to bring into hatred or contempt, or to excite disaffection against the administra\u00adtion of justice.\" This definition is qualified by the paragraph which follows:\nBut an intention is not seditious if the object is to show that the King has been misled or mistaken in his measures, or to point out errors or defects in the Government or Constitution with a view to their reformation, or to excite the subjects to attempt by lawful means the alteration of any matter in Church or State by law established, or to point out, with a view to their removal, matters which are producing, or have a tendency to produce, feelings of hatred and ill-will between classes of the King's subjects.\nIt will be observed that this definition corresponds almost exactly with that in Stephen's Digest of the Criminal Law, 8th Edition, pages 94 and 95, which in turn is very similar to that set out in Section 102 of the Draft 'Code. The rele\u00advant words of the definition in the Draft Code are:\nA seditious intention is an intention to bring into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection against ... the administration of justice ...: Provided that no one shall be deemed to have a seditious intention only because he intends in good faith ... to point out errors or defects ... in the administration of justice, with a view to the reformation of such alleged errors or defects.\nIn the report of the Commissioners on the Draft Code, at page 20, they make the following statement: \"Section 102, relating to seditious offences, is taken without altera\u00adtion from the Bill. It appears to us' to state accurately the existing law as stated in the authorities noted in the margin of the Draft Code. On this very delicate subject we do not undertake to suggest any alteration of the law.\"\nThe marginal note to section 102 of the Draft Code is as follows:\nThis is as accurate a statement of the existing law as we can make, See 60 Geo. 3 & I Geo. 4, c. 8. O'Connell v. R. 11, Cl. & F. 155,234. R. v. Lambert & Perry, 2 Camp. 398 R. v. Vincent, 9 C. & P. 91. We are unable to assent to the proposition that 33 Geo. 3, c. 29 (Irish Act) is declaratory of the common law.\nThe two statutes to which reference is made in the marginal note and the cases of R. v. Lambert and Perry and R. v. Vincent, do not assist in the solution of the question with which we are immediately concerned.\nIn O'Connell v. Reg.[68], the 8th, 9th and 10th counts in the indictment are set out at pages 163 and 164 of the report as follows:\n8th Count-That the said defendants, unlawfully and seditiously intending, etc., to bring into disrepute and to diminish the confidence of Her Majesty's subjects in the tribunals duly and lawfully constituted in Ireland for the administration of justice; on, etc. with force, etc. at etc., unlawfully, maliciously and seditiously did combine, conspire, con-federate, and agree with each other and with divers other persons whose names are to the jurors unkown, to bring into hatred and disrepute the tribunals by law established in Ireland for the administration of justice, and to diminish the confidence of Her said Majesty's liege subjects in Ireland in the administration of the law therein, with the intent to induce Her Majesty's subjects to withdraw the adjudication of their differences with and claims upon each other from the cognizance of the said tribunals by law established and to submit the same to the judgment and determination of other tribunals to be constituted and contrived for that purpose, in contempt, etc.\nThe 9th count was the same as the 8th, omitting from the intro\u00adductory part the words \"in Ireland,\" after the words \"duly and lawfully constituted\"; and in the Iast part of the count, after the words \"admin\u00adistration of the law therein,\" omitting the allegation as to withdrawing the 'adjudication of differences, and substituting the following: \"and to assume and usurp the prerogative of the Crown in the establishment of Courts for the administration of the law, in contempt,\" etc.\nThe 10th count was the same as the 8th in the introductory part, but the charge was in general terms, that the defendants unlawfully, maliciously, and seditiously did combine, conspire, confederate, and agree with each other and with divers other persons whose names are unknown, to bring into hatred and disrepute, the tribunals by law established in Ireland for the administration of justice, and to diminish the confidence of Her Majesty's liege subjects in Ireland in the administration of the laws therein, in contempt, etc.\nIt will be observed that in each of these counts the intention \"to bring into hatred and disrepute the tribunals by law established for the administration of justice and to diminish the confidence of Her Majesty's subjects therein\" was described as seditious.\nThe first question submitted by the House of Lords for the consideration of the Judges is set out at page 231 of the report as follows:\nAre all or any, and if any, which, of the counts in the indictment bad in law; so that if such count or counts stood alone in the indictment, no judgment against the defendants could properly be entered up on them?\nThe answer to this question insofar as it relates to Counts 8, 9 and 10 is found at pages 235 and 236. The judges were unanimously of opinion that these three counts were good in law. There is nothing in the reasons of the Law Lords who by a majority of three to two rejected the final result arrived at by the majority of the judges which throws any doubt upon the opinion that the counts set out above were good in law and that, had they stood alone in the indictment, judgment against the defendants could properly have been entered up on them. While, as' has been pointed out, this case was one of seditious conspiracy it appears to me to furnish support for the view that an 'intention to bring the administration of justice into hatred and disrepute and to diminish the confidence of His Majesty's subjects therein is a seditious intention.\nIn Odgers on Libel and Slander, 6th edition at page 432, there is the following statement:\nWe have already dealt with such contemptuous words as are defamatory of the Courts of Law, or of individual Judges, or of the administration of justice as a whole; such words are seditious and punishable as such. (see ante p. 426).\nThe reference to page 426 is to the following passage:\nIt is a misdemeanour to speak or publish of any Judge of a Superior Court words which would be libellous and actionable per se, if written and published of any other person holding a public office.\nIt is also a misdemeanour to speak or publish words defamatory of any Court of Justice or of the administration of the law therein, with intent to obstruct or invalidate its proceedings, to annoy its officers, to diminish its authority and dignity or to lower it in public esteem [sic].\nSuch words, whether spoken or written, are punishable on indictment or information with fine or imprisonment or both. They are also in every such case a contempt of Court punishable summarily by the Court itself with fine or commitment, as to which see post, Chap. XX.\nIt is immaterial whether the words be uttered in the presence of the Court, or at a time when the Court is not sitting and at a distance from it (Crawford's Case, 13 Q.B. 613; 18 L.J.Q.B. 225) ; nor need they necessarily refer to the Judges in their official capacity.\nBut there is no sedition in just criticism on the administration of the law. \"A writer may freely criticize the proceedings of courts of justice and of individual judges-nay, he is invited to do so, and to do so in a free, and fair, and liberal spirit. But it must be without malignity, and not imputing corrupt or malicious motives\" (per Fitzgerald, J., in R. v. Sullivan, 11 Cox, ,C.C. at p. 49). \"It certainly is lawful, with decency and candour, to discuss the propriety of the verdict of a jury, or the decisions of a judge, ... but if the extracts set out in the information contain no reasoning or discussion, but only declamation and invective, and were written, not with a view to elucidate the truth, but to injure the characters of individuals, and to bring into hatred and contempt the administration [sic] of justice in the country, \"then the defendants have trans\u00adgressed the law, and ought to be convicted (per Grose, J., in R. v. White and Another, 1 Camp. 369, n).\nTo assert that a Judge had been bribed, or that in any particular ease he had endeavoured to serve his own interest, or those of his friends or of his party, or wished to curry favour at Court, or was influenced by fear of the Government or of any great man, or by any motive other than a simple desire to arrive at the truth and to mete out justice impartially, is seditious. The passage just quoted is contained in the chapter dealing with \"seditious words\" and it is, I think, clear that in the opinion of the learned author words calculated to bring the administration of justice into hatred or contempt are punishable either on indictment as being a seditious libel or summarily as being a contempt of court.\nThe case of R. v. White and Another 1 Camp. 359 (n), mentioned above, is more fully reported sub nom R. v. Hart and White[69].\nIt appears that one Chapman and one Bennet had both been tried for murder before Leblanc, J. and a jury and had been found not guilty. The defendants Hart and White published letters criticizing these verdicts and reflecting in disparaging terms on the Judge and members of the jury.\nThey were tried upon an information preferred by the Attorney-General containing several counts. The sub-stance of the charge was that the accused \"intending to bring the administration of justice and the trial by jury as by law established in England into hatred and contempt among the liege subjects of our said Lord the King and to raise and excite disaffection and discontent in the minds of the liege subjects of our said Lord, the King ... did publish a certain scandalous, malicious and defamatory libel of and concerning the said respective trials of the said William Chapman and Thomas Bennett and of and concerning the verdicts aforesaid according to the tenor and effect following, (the libel was here set out) to the great scandal and disgrace of the administration of public justice in England.\"\nOther counts included an allegation of intention \"to traduce, defame and vilify the said Sir Simon Leblanc and the jurors and to bring the said Sir Simon Leblanc and the jurors into public hatred and contempt.\"\nA reading of the charge to the jury of Grose, J. which is set out in full commencing at page 1190 of the Report makes it clear that in his opinion the accused ought to be found guilty if the jury reached the conclusion that the document in question was published with the intention of maligning and vilifying the administration of justice in the country and casting a stigma upon it, and there is nothing in the charge to suggest that there was any further ingredient necessary to complete the offence.\nIn Russell on. Crimes, 9th Edition at page 87, the definition is given in the following words:\nSedition consists in acts, words, or writings intended or calculated, under the circumstances of the time, to disturb the tranquility of the State, by creating ill-will, discontent, disaffection, hatred, or contempt towards the person of the King, or towards the Constitution or Parliament, or the Government, or the established institutions of the country, or by exciting ill-will between different classes of the King's subjects, or encouraging any class of them to endeavour to disobey, defy, or subvert the laws or resist their execution, or to create tumults or riots, or to do any act of violence or outrage or endangering the public peace.\nWhen the offence is committed by means of writing, or print, or pictures, it is termed seditious libel.\nThe offence is a misdemeanour indictable at common law.\nIt will be observed that this definition does not make any express reference to the courts or to the administration. of justice, although the courts would presumably be included in the expression \"the established institutions of the country.\" At page 88, the writer says,\nAccording to the older authorities it is seditious wantonly to defame or indecorously to calumniate that economy, order and constitution of things which make up the general system of the law and government of the country; and more particularly to degrade or calumniate the person and character of the sovereign, or the administration of his government by his officers and ministers of state, or the administration of justice by his judges, or the proceedings of either House of Parliament.\nI am not able to determine whether, by the form of expression used, the learned author intends to convey the opinion that an intention to degrade or calumniate the administration of justice is no longer in law regarded as seditious; but I am inclined to think that he did not intend to express this view, as the text immediately continues with the statement that the present view of the law is best stated in R. v. Burns[70]. The learned author proceeds to quote at length from the charge to the jury of Cave, J., in that case, including the following passage at page 92, in which Cave, J. was quoting with approval from the charge of Fitzgerald, J. to the jury in Reg. v. Sullivan[71],\nViewing the case in a free, bold, manly and generous spirit towards the defendant, if you come to the conclusion that the publications indicted are not seditious libels, or were not published in the sense imputed to them you are bound, and I ask you in the name of free discussion, to find a verdict for the defendant. I need not remind you of the worn-out topic to extend to the defendant the benefit of the doubt. If on the other hand, on the whole spirit and import of these articles, you are obliged to come to the conclusion that they are seditious libels, and that their necessary consequences are to excite contempt of Her Majesty's Government, or to bring the administration of the law into contempt and impair its functions-if you come to that conclusion either as to the articles or prints, or any of them, then it becomes your duty honestly and fearlessly to find a verdict of conviction upon such counts as you believe are proved.\nIt will be observed that in the passage quoted the neces\u00adsary consequences, which the learned judge said would render the publications seditious' libels, are stated dis\u00adjunctively and that one of them is \"to bring the administra\u00adtion of the law into contempt and impair its functions.\"\nIn Archbold's Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice 32nd Edition at page 1238, it is said: \"Libels on a judge or a jury may, in certain events be seditious,\" and at page 1146, \"to impute corruption to judges has been said to be seditious.\"\nMany of the cases cited by the respective authors in support of the definition of \"seditious intention\", above referred to, i.e., \"to bring into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection against the administration of justice\", do not touch upon the point now under consideration but deal only with other branches of the definition of seditious intention. I have not found in any of the cases cited any expression which appears to me to be inconsistent with the above definition or to suggest that it omits any essential ingredient. The definition appears to me to have the sup-port of the text-writers mentioned above, of the Commis\u00adsioners who reported on the Draft Code (Lord Blackburn, Barry, J., Lush, J. and Sir James Stephen, later Stephen, J.) of Grose, J. in R. v. White and Hart (supra), of Fitzgerald, J. in R. v. Sullivan (supra), of Cave, J. in R. v. Burns (supra) and of a court consisting of Lord O'Brien, L.C.J. and Murphy, Gibson and Madden, J.J. in Reg. v. M'Hugh[72].\nThe last mentioned case appears to me to be directly in point. Two men had been indicted and convicted before Andrews, J. and a jury on a charge of conspiracy and M'Hugh was charged with publishing a libel in regard to their trial. The information set forth that the defendant M'Hugh,\nbeing au evil disposed person, wickedly and maliciously contriving and .intending to bring the administration of justice in this kingdom into contempt, and to scandalize and vilify the said William Drennan Andrews and the jurors by whom the said issue was so tried as aforesaid, and to cause it to be believed that the said jurors had violated their oaths as such jurors, on the 16th day of December, in the year aforesaid wickedly and maliciously did print and publish, and cause to be printed and pub\u00adlished, a certain false, wicked, scandalous and malicious libel of and concerning the administration of justice in this kingdom, and of and concerning the said Right Honourable William Drennan Andrews and the jurors by whom the said issue was so tried as aforesaid, according to the tenor and effect following:\n(Here followed the libel, which in substance and effect, was a scandalous and malicious libel, concerning the administration of justice in Ireland, and concerning the Judge and jury who had tried the case.)\nto the great scandal and reproach of the administration of justice, in contempt of our Lady the Queen and her laws, to the evil example of all others in the like case offending, and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her Crown and dignity.\nThere were other counts in the information but they were substantially to the same effect.\nIt will be observed that neither the word \"seditious?' nor any similar word was used anywhere in the information. The matter came before the court on a demurrer by the Attorney General to pleas, made by the accused which might have been good in a case of defamatory libel but not in a case of seditious libel and one of the questions for the court was whether or not the information charged a seditious libel. The following passages appear to me to be relevant to the point under consideration; at page 577 in the judgment of O'Brien, L.C.J.:\nThe question remains, are the libels complained of seditious libels? The word \"seditious\" is certainly not used in the information, but we are all of opinion that it is not a word of art, and that, if the substance of what is a seditious libel is stated, this is enough. In the long history of seditious libels it has never been decided that it was essential to employ in the pleading the words \"seditious\" or \"seditiously\". On the contrary, there are cases in the books, which have been referred to during the argument in which, though the prosecutions were plainly for seditious libels, the words \"seditious\" or \"seditiously\" were not used.\nAt the same page:\nHave we then in this case, in substance, the essential elements of a seditious libel? No doubt the words complained of are defamatory, but have we in the averments what is equivalent to the allegation of a seditious intent? This brings me to the consideration of what is the legal definition of a seditious intent. It is correctly stated in the late Mr. Justice Stephen's work on the criminal law. He there defines a \"seditious intention\" to be \"an intention to bring into hatred or contempt, or to excite disaffection against, the person of Her Majesty, her heirs or successors, or the Government and Constitution of the United Kingdom as by law established, or either Houses of Parliament, or the administra\u00adtion of the law\" ... I stop here and do not give the full definition. I give only the relevant portion. An intention, then, to bring into hatred or contempt the administration of the law falls within the definition of seditious intent.\nThis being so, I turn to the information to ascertain whether what constitutes a seditious intent is sufficiently alleged therein. I find that it is alleged \"that Patrick A. M'Hugh, wickedly and maliciously contriving and intending to bring the administration of justice in this Kingdom into contempt,\" did publish the libel complained of. This is the intent alleged against the defendant, and it is one of the intents which make libellous matter seditious. I am therefore of opinion that what is complained of is a seditious libel.\nAt page 579:\nAs I have already stated, if these articles refer at all to Mr. Justice Andrews, it is in his judicial character that they refer to him. In his private personal character a Judge receives no more protection from the law than any other member of the community at large ; and even in his judicial character, he should always welcome fair, decent, candid, and I would add, vigorous criticism of his judicial conduct; but, on the other hand, deliberate misconduct in his judicial character must not be imputed. If a Judge deliberately misconducts himself in his judicial office, the Constitution has provided a remedy-his removal.\nThe law in this respect is correctly stated by Mr. Odgers in his book on libel. He says to assert that a judge has been bribed, or that in any particular case he had endeavoured to serve his own interests, or those of his friends, or his party, or had wished -to curry favour at Court, or was influenced by fear of the Government, or of any great man, or by any other motive than a simple desire to arrive at the truth, and to mete out justice impartially, is seditious.\nAt page 584 in the judgment of Gibson, J.:\nAn intent to bring the administration of justice into contempt is a seditious intent, and not the less so because it is associated with aspersions on the Judge or jury who tried a particular case. The information here alleges what the law defines to be a seditious intent. The thing is there though the word is not.\nAt page 587 in the judgment of Madden, J.:\nProbably none of the attempts which have been made to define a seditious intention, or rather to enumerate various kinds of intention which the law regards as seditious, are completely satisfactory or ex\u00adhaustive. But it is clear that an intention to bring the administration of justice into hatred or contempt amounts to such an intention. The intention is, in each instance, something different from the defamatory writing. The character of the writing may be strong, and in some cases irresistible, evidence of the existence of an intention to bring the admini\u00adstration of justice into contempt. In other cases a jury might fairly believe that a charge was brought, against persons engaged in the conduct of a trial, for the purpose, not of vilifying, but of purifying, the administration of justice. In such a case the defendant ought to be acquitted, because the intention, which is the essential part of the offence, was not proven as charged.\nIn my opinion at Common Law an intention to bring into hatred or contempt or to create disaffection against the administration of justice is a seditious intention and I do not find anything in the provisions of the Criminal Code to negative this view. Section 133 (4) of the Criminal Code defines one type of seditious intention but the opening words of that subsection \"Without limiting the generality of the meaning of the expression 'seditious intention' \", make it clear that in the view of Parliament that definition is not exhaustive.\nIn section 133 (a) it is provided that \"no one shall be deemed to have a seditious intention only because he intends in good faith ... to point out errors or defects ... in the administration of justice.\" The wording of this proviso seems to indicate the view of Parliament that under some circumstances an attack on the administration of justice is to be regarded as seditious.\nIf it is suggested that there is an inconsistency in reject\u00ading the definition of seditious intention contained in the Draft Code as incomplete insofar as it deals with the inten\u00adtion to create ill-will and hostility between different classes of His Majesty's subjects and accepting it as accurate insofar as it deals with the intention to bring the adminis\u00adtration of justice into hatred and contempt, the answer is that, in my view, the former branch of the definition is not supported by authority, whereas the latter is.\nIt is true that strictly speaking none of the authorities to which I have made reference are binding upon this court but I do not think we should disturb a current of authority, which appears to me to extend over many years and against which I can find no reported judgment, unless we were clearly of the opinion that such authority was wrong in principle. Far from entertaining any such view, it appears to me that it is right in principle. It is easy to imagine many cases where an intention to create ill-will and hostility between different classes of His Majesty's subjects would not include the intention, or have the probable effect, of an interference with the due processes of lawfully constituted authority; but it seems to me that such an interference must of necessity result from bringing the administration of justice into hatred or contempt or exciting disaffection against it.\nIt is not necessary to adopt everything that was said by Wilmot, J. in his opinion in Almon's case[73], which, although never delivered as a judgment of the court, has been quoted and accepted as a high authority in many subsequent judgments, but the following passage from page 259 appears to me to be relevant.\nThe Constitution has provided very apt and proper remedies for correcting and rectifying the involuntary mistakes of judges, and for punishing and removing them for any voluntary perversions of justice. But if their authority is to be trampled on by pamphleteers and news-writers, and the people are to be told that the power, given to the Judges for their protection, is prostituted to their destruction, the Court may retain its power for some little time, but I am sure it will instantly lose all its authority; and the power of the Court will not long survive the authority of it.\nThe opinion in Almon's Case was prepared in a case of attachment for contempt and not in a case of indictment for libel. It has been suggested that a publication which amounts to a criminal contempt of the court by \"scanda\u00adlizing the Court\" should be proceeded against, if at all, as a contempt and not as a seditious libel. It seems to me that where the nature of a publication appears to the Attorney-General to merit the institution of criminal pro\u00adceedings against its publisher it is his responsibility to decide whether the matter should be brought before the courts by way of contempt proceedings or by indictment for seditious libel.\nThere is, I think, much to be said in favour of the view that, where it is intended to commence criminal proceedings against a person for publishing matter said to be calculated to bring the administration of justice into hatred and contempt, it is better that such proceedings should be taken by way of indictment so that the accused may have the benefit of a trial by jury, rather than by summary proceedings for contempt, in which, it has sometimes been said, the judge is at once judge of the law, of the fact, of the intention and of the sentence, and his decision is without any power of review. (See Sir John Fox, Contempt of Court (1927) page 42). It cannot be successfully argued that because a matter appears to be a criminal contempt of Court it may not also be a seditious libel. Section 15 of the Code recognizes that an act or omission may constitute several different offences and this was true also at Common Law (vide; e.g. Wemyss v. Hopkins[74], Regina v. King[75].\nTo briefly summarize my conclusions, I am of opinion that an intention to bring the administration of justice into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection against it is a seditious intention ; that an intention in good faith to point out errors or defects in the administration of justice is not a seditious intention and that it is the right of every citizen to criticize freely and vigorously the pro\u00adceedings of the courts of justice, the decisions of the judges, and the verdicts of juries.\nI think that in the case at bar, and in the case of every charge of publishing a seditious libel, where the gravamen of the charge is the alleged intention to bring the adminis\u00adtration of justice into hatred and contempt, the question to be left to the jury is whether the real intention of the person charged was to vilify the administration of justice, destroy public confidence therein and to bring it into contempt; or whether the publication, however vigorously worded, was honestly intended to purify the administra\u00adtion of justice by pointing out, with a view to their remedy, errors or defects which the accused honestly believed to exist. As in all cases tried by a jury, there is a preliminary question for the Court whether there is any evidence on which a jury could reasonably find the existence of the guilty intention. If in the Court's opinion there is such evidence the case should be left to the jury, who after being instructed as to what is and what is not a guilty intention should be reminded that if they are in doubt as to the true intention of the accused it is their duty to acquit him.\nAs, in my opinion, there should he a new trial in the case at bar, it is not desirable that I should say more than is necessary about the evidence in the record. It appears to me that the words of the pamphlet furnish evidence upon which a properly instructed jury could reasonably find the existence of an intention to bring the administra\u00adtion of justice into hatred or contempt or to create disaffection against it.\nI have particularly in mind the following two passages:\n... et que faut-il penser de ses juges qui imposent de lourdes amendes ainsi que des sentences de prison \u00e0 ces personnes, qui les invectivent d'un langage injurieux, et qui suivent d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment une politique malicieuse en ajournant maintes et maintes fois les causes, afin de retenir engag\u00e9 des dizaines de milliers de dollars en cautionnements exhorbitants, et afin de garder des centaines de causes pendantes? Ces l\u00e9gislateurs, ces corps de police et ces juges du Qu\u00e9bec montrent-ils ainsi leur amour pour la libert\u00e9? Honn\u00eatement, croyez-vous que ces fruits sont le produit de l'amour, ou celui de la haine? \"Vous les conna\u00eetrez donc \u00e0 leurs fruits.\" (Matthieu 7:20, Crampon).\nToutes les cours Canadiennes Fran\u00e7aises \u00e9taient tellement sous l'influence sacerdotale qu'elles confirm\u00e8rent la sentence inf\u00e2me, ...\nWhile, as has been already mentioned, the greater part of the argument before us was devoted to other aspects of the case, the two passages, just quoted, were set out ver\u00adbatim in the indictment, were mentioned in the charge to the jury of the learned trial Judge and were dealt with both by Counsel for the Crown and by Counsel for the Appellant in their Factums and in their oral argument.\nThe first quoted passage appears to me to be a direct imputation to the Judges of the Province of Quebec, not of mistake but of malice, in the performance of their judicial duties. The last quoted passage appears to me to fall directly within the passage from Odgers which was approved by O'Brien, L.C.J. in R. v. M'Hugh in the quota\u00adtion set out above. It is, I think, an assertion that all those Courts in Quebec which dealt with a certain case affirmed a sentence, described not as erroneous but as infamous, and did so because they were influenced by something other than a simple desire to arrive at the truth and to mete out justice impartially.\nFor all of the above reasons, I am of opinion that the Appeal should be allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered.\nAppeal allowed, conviction quashed and acquittal directed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. G. How.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A. Lacourci\u00e8re.\n[ScanLII Collection]\n[1] Q.R. [1949] K.B. 238.\n[2] Q.R.

Each company was to file a return of its revenues forming the basis of taxation on or before January 31 of each year. In 1947, by ss. 3 and 4 of c. 103, s. 39a was amended to provide for an increase in rate to 2 1\/2 per cent and to change the basis of taxation in the case of the B.C. Electric Ry. Co. from \"the amount of fares annually received\" to \"the basic fare revenue as defined in an agreement between the City and the said Company dated December 30, 1946\", this last mentioned provision \"to have had effect on and from the first day of January, 1947\". The 1947 Act, which became effective on April 3, 1947, was not otherwise made retroactive.\nAppellant contended that the new rate became effective in respect of the taxation period of 1947, or alternatively as of the date the Act was assented to. The defendants claimed that it became effective commencing with the taxation year 1948. The Court of Appeal affirmed the dismissal of the action by the trial judge.\nHeld: (Affirming the judgment appealed from), that the new rate of 2 1\/2 per cent did not apply to taxation of the respondents for the year 1947, and was not retroactive to January 1, 1937.\nHeld: Respondents became liable for the tax before the new rate under the 1947 Act had become effective, and not at the time that the rating by-law for 1947 was passed on April 18, 1947.\nMiller v. Salomons (1852) 7 Ex. 476; Queen v. Judge of City of London (1892) 1 Q.B. 273; Mersey Dock v. Turner [1893] A.C. 468 and Bradlaugh v. Clarke [1883] 8 A.C. 354 referred to. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] affirming a judgment of Macfarlane J. dismissing an action to recover taxes.\nH. E. Manning K.C. and J.B. Roberts for the appellant.\nJ. W. de B. Farris K.C. and A. Bruce Robertson for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Rand J. was delivered by\nRAND J.:\u2014In this appeal, a question of taxation is raised. Prior to April 3, 1947, section 39A of the charter of Vancouver, as enacted by chapter 78 of the statutes of 1931, was in the following language:\u2014\n39A. (1) The poles, conduits, cables, and wires of any telephone, electric light, or electric power company; the mains of any gas company; the rails, poles and wires of any street-railway or tramway company; and the plant and machinery, being fixtures appurtenant thereto and used in any way in connection therewith by any such company when situate on any street or public place, shall be deemed to be rateable property and shall be liable to taxation as provided in subsection (2) hereof.\n(2) The several companies aforesaid shall be taxed annually at the rate of one per cent per annum (a) in the case of every telephone company on the gross rentals\u2026; (b) in the case of every gas company on the amount annually received\u2026; (c) in the case of every street-railway company on the amount of fares. The foregoing rates of taxation shall be in force from the first day of January, 1932, until the year 1936, inclusive, and thereafter until amended by Statute. The taxation imposed shall be in lieu of all taxes otherwise imposed and payable to the city upon the aforesaid property after the said first day of January, 1932.\n(3) Every company to which this section applies shall annually, without any notice or demand, make a return of its revenue which forms the basis of the taxation hereunder, and shall file a return with the City Assessor on or before the thirty-first day of January in each year.\n(4) For the purposes of recording on the assessment roll the property represented in this section, the Assessor shall, in respect to each and every one of the several companies aforesaid, set out on the assessment roll an amount which as a capital sum would yield on the basis of the taxation of improvements for rateable property within the city for the previous year an amount equivalent to the taxes payable under this section based on the revenues of the said companies as herein prescribed at the rate of one per cent per annum.\nBy chapter 68, 1936, the rate under the section was increased from 1 per cent to 1 1\/2 per cent and the duration dates changed to January 1, 1937 and the year 1939 respectively. By chapter 103, 1947, assented to on April 3, the following amendments were made :\n3. (1) Subsection (2) of section 39A, as enacted by section 3 of the \"Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921, Amendment Act, 1931,\" and amended by section 7 of the \"Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921, Amendment Act, 1936,\" is further amended by striking out the words \"in the case of every street-railway company on the amount of fares annually received upon its street-cars within the city\" in the ninth and tenth lines, and substituting therefor the following: \"in the case of the British Columbia Electric Railway Company, Limited, on the basic fare revenue as defined in an agreement between the city and the said company, dated the thirtieth day of December, 1946, in respect of its street-cars and trolley coaches operated under such agreement.\"\n(2) Subsection (1) hereof shall not come into force and shall have no effect unless the agreement therein mentioned has been validated and confirmed by Statute of the Province, in which case it shall be deemed to have come into force and to have had effect on and from the first day of January, 1947.\n4. (1) Subsection (2) of section 39A, as enacted by section 3 of the \"Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921, Amendment Act, 1931,\" and amended by section 7 of the \"Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921, Amendment Act,. 1936,\" is further amended by striking out the words \"one and one-half\" in the second line, and substituting therefor the words \"two and one-half.\"\n(2) Subsection (4) of said section 39A is amended by striking out the words \"one and one-half\" in the eighth line, and substituting therefor the words \"two and one-half.\"\nThe agreement mentioned in section 3(2) was confirmed by chapter 94, 1947, as of the same date, April 3.\nAs it was impracticable for the respondents to furnish audited returns by January 31 in any year, the revenue in each case for the second anterior year was taken to be that for the preceding year, so that for 1947 the figures used were those for 1945, returned some time in 1946. From January 1, 1947, then, that datum for the purposes of the tax was officially in the records of the City.\nThe assessment roll is to be completed by December 31 and, subject to amendment thereafter by the assessment courts, is declared to be the roll for the ensuing year. The final closure took place in the month of February, 1947.\nPrior to that, and pursuant to ss. (4) of section 39A, a constructive valuation of the properties of the respondents, described in 39A (1), through the capitalization of the tax, being 11\/2 per cent of the revenue returned, at the rate for improvements in 1946, was entered on the roll, and this valuation at the latter rate would, of course, reproduce the tax. In February, then, both assessed value and rate were likewise officially in the records of the City.\nIn those circumstances, at what moment can it be said that the tax against the respondents was imposed? If, in any case, that took place after April the 3rd the new rate undoubtedly applied; it was then the only rate in force. But Mr. Manning argues that all taxes founded on the assessment roll become imposed at the same moment, and if the constructive value is strict assessment, that moment could not be prior to the passage of the bylaw levying the general rate on April 18, at a time when the rate of 2 1\/2 per cent was effective. If, on the other hand, the tax, so founded, was imposed before April 3, or the entry is for other than assessment purposes and the tax is external to the roll, then the concluding language of 39(2) relates the tax at 2 1\/2 per cent back to the beginning of 1937.\nBy section 57, in each year the by-law levies the general rate to provide tax revenue for the year's financial requirements. Section 59 directs the collector to make out a tax roll in which is to be set down \"with respect to each parcel of land upon which taxes have been imposed, the following information\u2026\" Then follow particulars of land, ownership, assessed value, etc.; and ss. (2) provides that \"the said roll shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of its contents, and shall be received in evidence in any court of law.\"\nThe word \"levying\", the equivalent of \"imposing\", signifies the execution of legislative power which charges on person or property the obligation of or liability for a tax. As early as 1864, in Laughtenborough v. McLean[2] , it was stated that \"the collector's roll is made, not for the purpose of creating a charge, but for the purpose of collecting a charge already made by the assessment roll.\" Devanney v. Dorr[3] , after a reference to the binding effect of the assessment roll, continues, \"and the person assessed becomes chargeable for any sums ordered to be levied.\" This conception of the provisions of the Ontario Assessment Acts, in general the prototypes of enactments in the Western provinces, was followed in Rural Municipality of Armstrong v. Gibson[4] ; and in its reference to taxes which \"have been imposed\" the language of section 59 seems to me to conclude the question.\nThe result, then, is that upon the concurrence of the closed assessment roll and the by-law levying the rate, the imposition of the tax is effected, and the extension of the details on the tax roll is a ministerial or executive act.\nThe taxes here are in a special category. The assessment can be said to be represented by the capitalization, and the rate is that of the previous year. But it is said you cannot have impositions of tax, related to an assessment roll, arising at different times. I cannot see why not. The roll furnishes one factor and there is nothing in the statute that suspends the execution when both are operative; and by section 61 all taxes are referred back to January 1 as the date from which they are to be deemed due. If, then, the tax is one which the assessment roll embraces, it was imposed before April 3. The same result follows if the taxes are external to the roll: the tax became imposed upon the concurrence of the return of revenue and the statutory rate, which would be not later than January 31.\nIn either of the cases mentioned, what is the effect of the amendment on the years, including 1947, back to 1937? The contention is that it levies additional taxes on the respondents regardless of financial requirements of the City or of any other consideration.\nThe language \"the foregoing rates of taxation shall be in force from the first day of January, 1937, until the year 1939, inclusive\" in ss. (2) were enacted in 1936; by the same enactment the rate was increased from 1 per cent to 1 1\/2 per cent; and it was that particular rate which was to continue from 1937 to and after 1939 \"until amended by Statute.\" The change of rate in 1947 is such an amendment, and it brings to an end the duration of the provision of 1936: upon its enactment, the clause was fulfilled. It is altogether misleading to read the particulars of amendment as inserted in the section but without reference to the original and the amending enactments. Although a statute is to be read as always speaking, that rule cannot continue in force a provision which by its terms has ceased to be operative on a certain event; to speak it must be revived, which, in this case, it was not.\nIn The King v. Spirit River Lumber Co.[5] , what was in question was the applicability of a general provision for the recovery of any tax imposed under the Act to a tax provided subsequently by an amendment. The provision by its nature was to continue and to attach to whatever tax liability from time to time arose under the statute. Here the clause is limited in its application to a specific rate under legislation enacted in a certain year; and when that rate is repealed the clause is exhausted of effect.\nThat we may look at the history of legislation to ascertain its present meaning is undoubted: Attorney-General v. Lamplough[6] , and in the language of Brett, L.J. at p. 231:\u2014\nWe cannot tell what is the effect of the latter without looking at the meaning of the statute which it has repealed. We must treat it as we treat all statutes for the purpose of construing them; we must look at the facts which were existing at the time the Act passed, to see what was its meaning.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.:\u2014This is an appeal by the City of Vancouver from the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[7] , affirming the judgment at the trial of three actions (now consolidated) brought against British Columbia Telephone Company, British Columbia Electric Railway Company, Limited, and British Columbia Electric Company, Limited, by the City for the recovery of taxes alleged to have fallen due in 1947 at the rate of two and one-half percentum on certain receipts of the Companies. The determination of the right of the City to succeed depends upon the relevant provisions of an Act known as the Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921, chapter 55 of the British Columbia Statutes of 1921, and amending Acts, and particularly an amendment of 1947. The first amendment to the Act to be noted was enacted in 1931 by chapter 78 whereby, for the first time, section 39A was inserted in the following terms:\n39A. The poles, conduits, cables and wires of any telephone, electric light, or electric power company; the mains of any gas company; the rails, poles, and wires of any street-railway or tramway company; and the plant and machinery, being fixtures appurtenant thereto and used in any way in connection therewith by any such company when situate on any street or public place, shall be deemed to be rateable property and shall be liable to taxation as provided in subsection (2) hereof.\n(2) The several companies aforesaid shall be taxed annually at the rate of one per cent per annum (a) in the case of every telephone company on the gross rentals actually annually received from its subscribers for telephones situate within the city, including inter-exchange tolls for calls between exchanges within the city;\n(b) in the case of every gas company, electric lighting company, and electric power company on the amount annually received by such company for gas, electric light, or electric power consumed within the city; (c) in the case of every street-railway company on the amount of fares annually received upon its street-cars within the city. The foregoing rates of taxation shall be in force from the first day of January, 1932, until the year 1936, inclusive, and thereafter until amended by Statute. The taxation imposed shall be in lieu of all taxes otherwise imposed and payable to the city upon the aforesaid property after the said first day of January, 1932.\n(3) Every company to which this section applies shall annually, without any notice or demand, make a return of its revenue which forms the basis of the taxation hereunder, and shall file a return with the City Assessor on or before the thirty-first day of January in each year.\n(4) For the purposes of recording on the assessment roll the property represented in this section, the Assessor shall, in respect to each and every one of the several companies aforesaid, set out on the assessment roll an amount which as a capital sum would yield on the basis of the taxation of improvements for rateable property within the city for the previous year an amount equivalent to the taxes payable under this section based on the revenues of the said companies as herein prescribed at the rate of one per cent per annum.\nIn 1936, by chapter 68, section 7, it was provided as follows:\n7. (1). Subsection (2) of section 39A of said chapter 55, as enacted by section 3 of the \"Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921, Amendment Act, 1931\" is amended by striking out the word \"one\" in the second line thereof, and substituting therefor the words \"one and one-half\"; and by striking out the words and figures \"1932 until the year 1936\" in the twelfth line thereof, and substituting therefor the words and figures \"1937 until the year 1939\"; and by striking out the figures \"1932\" in the last line thereof, and substituting therefor the figures \"1937\".\n(2) Subsection (4) of said section 39A is amended by striking out the word \"one\" in the eighth line thereof, and substituting therefor the words \"one and one-half\".\n(3) Subsection (1) of this section shall come into force and take effect on the first day of January, 1937. In 1947, sections 3 and 4 of chapter 103 of the British Columbia Statutes enacted:\n3. (1). Subsection (2) of section 39A, as enacted by section 3 of the \"Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921, Amendment Act, 1931,\" and amended by section 7 of the \"Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921, Amendment Act, 1936,\" is further amended by striking out the words \"in the case of every street-railway company on the amount of fares annually received upon its street-cars within the city\" in the ninth and tenth lines, and substituting therefor the following: \"in the case of the British Columbia Electric Railway Company, Limited, on the basic fare revenue as defined in an agreement between the city and the said Company, dated the thirtieth day of December, 1946, in respect of its street-cars and trolley-coaches operated under such agreement.\"\n(2) Subsection (1) hereof shall not come into force and shall have no effect unless the agreement therein mentioned has been validated and confirmed by Statute of the Province, in which case it shall be deemed to have come into force and to have had effect on and from the first day of January, 1947.\n4. (1) Subsection (2) of section 39A, as enacted by section 3 of the \"Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921, Amendment Act, 1931,\" and amended by section 7 of the \"Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921, Amendment Act, 1936,\" is further amended by striking out the words \"one and one-half\" in the second line, and substituting therefor the words \"two and one-half.\"\n(2) Subsection (4) of said section 39A is amended by striking out the words \"one and one-half\" in the eighth line, and substituting therefor the words \"two and one-half.\"\nThe agreement referred to in subsection 1, above quoted, although dated December 30, 1946, provided by paragraph 59:\n59. (a) The Company shall consent to a request by the Corporation to the Legislature of the Province of British Columbia for the amendment of section 39A of the Vancouver Incorporation Act so that commencing on the 1st day of January, 1947 the tax of 1 1\/2 per cent now imposed under subsection (2) of the said section on the fares annually received by the Company upon its street cars within the city shall be calculated upon the basic fare revenue as hereinafter defined in respect of its street cars and trolley coaches operated under this agreement.\n(b) In the meantime and commencing on the first day of January, 1947, the parties shall govern themselves as though the said section 39A had been amended as aforesaid, and any moneys paid under this clause shall, until the said section shall have been so amended, be applied on account of the Company's obligation from time to time under the said section to the extent necessary to discharge such obligation.\nWhile the reference in clause (a) to the tax of 1 1\/2 per cent might be said only to identify the tax under subsection 2 of section 39A of the Act, whatever might be the rate, it is of significance when taken in conjunction with the provisions of clause (b) by which, commencing January 1, 1947, the parties were to govern themselves in the meantime, before ratification of the agreement by the Legislature, as though section 39A had been amended. The agreement was ratified by an Act assented to on April 3, 1947, the same day that the 1947 amendment to the Act recived the Royal Assent. It has not been overlooked that his agreement is with one only of the respondents.\nAnother significant fact is that while subsection 1 of section 3 of the 1947 amendment is to come into force on and from January 1, 1947, no date is fixed for the coming into force of the other provisions. In view of this, I take the intention of the Legislature to be that all the Companies are subject to taxation for the year 1947 at the old rate of one and one-half percentum per annum and not at the new rate.\nWhile it was arranged between the City and the Companies that \"for the purposes of recording on the assessment roll the property represented\" in section 39A, the assessor should take the audited statements of receipts by the Companies, say for the year 1945, in making the entry on the assessment roll in 1946, that arrangement cannot, of course, alter the proper construction of the 1947 amendment. Nevertheless it is important to notice that the assessor is to begin to make the assessment not later than November 1 in each year for the year following and is to return to the City Clerk the assessment roll not later than December 31 in each year. The entry made by the assessor in the assessment roll, under the provisions of subsection 4 of section 39A of the Act, has no relevancy to the taxation to which the respondents are subject under that section. The entry made in 1946 in an assessment roll which is to be used in 1947 is of a capital sum that would yield \"on the basis of the taxation of improvements for rateable property within the City for the previous year\" an amount equivalent to the taxes payable under section 39A. The tax rate for such previous year might, or might not, be the tax rate for the year 1947. That being so, the assessment cannot be the basis for the taxation of the Companies under section 39A. The respondents are in a special position so far as taxation under that section is concerned and the general incidence of assessment under the Act does not affect the point to be determined.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nLOCKE, J.:\u2014By section 39 of the Vancouver Incorporation Act, c. 55, Statutes of British Columbia 1921, 2nd Session, all rateable property in the City, or any interest therein, is made liable to assessment at its actual cash value as it would be appraised in payment of a just debt from a solvent debtor, the value of the improvements, if any, being estimated separately from the value of the land. By an amendment made in 1931 (s. 3, c. 78) section 39A was added whereby special provision was made for the assessment of, inter alia, telephone, electric light and power and street railway companies by defining that portion of their assets which should be deemed to be rateable property and liable to taxation, and providing for a tax at the rate of 1 per cent of a defined proportion of their receipts. Section 39A thus introduced was amended by section 7 of chapter 68 of the statutes of 1936 and, as thus amended, read as follows:\n39A. (1) The poles, conduits, cables, and wires of any telephone, electric light, or electric power company; the mains of any gas company; the rails, poles, and wires of any street-railway or tramway company; and the plant and machinery, being fixtures appurtenant thereto and used in any way in connection therewith by any such company when situate on any street or public place, shall be deemed to be rateable property and shall be liable to taxation as provided in subsection (2) hereof.\n(2) The several companies aforesaid shall be taxed annually at the rate of one and one-half per cent per annum (a) in the case of every telephone company on the gross rentals actually annually received from its subscribers for telephones situate within the city, including inter-exchange tolls for calls between exchanges within the city, (b) in the case of every gas company, electric lighting company and electric power company on the amount annually received by such company for gas, electric light, or electric power consumed within the city, (c) in the case of every street railway company on the amount of fares annually received upon its street cars within the city. The foregoing rates of taxation shall be in force from the first day of January, 1937, until the year 1939, inclusive, and thereafter until amended by Statute. The taxation imposed shall be in lieu of all taxes otherwise imposed and payable to the city upon the aforesaid property after the said first day of January, 1937.\n(3) Every company to which this section applies shall annually, without any notice or demand, make a return of its revenue which forms the basis of the taxation hereunder, and shall file a return with the City Assessor on or before the thirty-first day of January in each year.\n(4) For the purposes of recording on the Assessment Roll the property represented in this section, the Assessor shall, in respect to each and every one of the several companies aforesaid, set out on the Assessment Roll an amount which as a capital sum would yield on the basis of the taxation of improvements for rateable property within the city for the previous year an amount equivalent to the taxes payable under this section based on the revenues of the said companies as herein prescribed at the rate of one and one-half per cent per annum.\nSubsection (1) of this section shall come into force and take effect on the first day of January, 1937.\nBy an agreement made between the appellant corporation and the respondent British Columbia Electric Railway Company Limited, dated December 30, 1946, the parties agreed, subject to confirmation by the legislature, upon terms for the extension of the franchise of the street railway company for the operation of street cars, trolley coaches and motor buses for a term of twenty years. By the agreement the City undertook to make a request to the Legislature at its next session for the enactment of legislation confirming it and authorizing the parties to carry it into effect as though it had been confirmed and come into force on January 1, 1947, the street railway company agreed to support the request and the parties undertook that in the meantime, commencing on the said last mentioned date, they would govern themselves as though the agreement had come into force on that day. Paragraph 59 of the agreement reads as follows:\n59. (a) The Company shall consent to a request by the Corporation to the Legislature of the Province of British Columbia for the amendment of section 39A of the Vancouver Incorporation Act so that commencing on the 1st day of January, 1947 the tax of 11\/2 per cent now imposed under subsection (2) of the said section on the fares annually received by the Company upon its street cars within the city shall be calculated upon the basic fare revenue as hereinafter defined in respect of its street cars and trolley coaches operated under this agreement.\n(b) In the meantime and commencing on the first day of January, 1947, the parties shall govern themselves as though the said section 39A had been amended as aforesaid, and any moneys paid under this clause shall, until the said section shall have been so amended, be applied on account of the Company's obligation from time to time under the said section to the extent necessary to discharge such obligation.\nThe expression \"basic fare revenue\" appearing in clause (a) of the section was by section 61 defined as including amongst other revenues \"City fare revenue\" and this in turn was defined as meaning \"the total of all passenger fares collected by the company for travel on its street cars, trolley coaches and motor buses (including chartered vehicles) operated under this agreement wholly within the City\" less certain specified deductions.\nOn April 3, 1947, an Act to amend the \"Vancouver Enabling Act\" (c. 94) was assented to which approved the terms and validated and confirmed as of the first day of January, 1947, the above mentioned agreement in the following terms:\n2. Notwithstanding anything contained in the \"Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921,\" or any other Act, the agreement entered into on the thirtieth day of December, 1946, and made between the City of Vancouver of the one part and British Columbia Electric Railway Company Limited of the other part, for granting a transportation franchise in the City of Vancouver, is hereby validated and confirmed as of the first day of January, 1947, and the parties thereto are hereby empowered and authorized to carry the same into effect accordingly.\nOn the same date an Act to amend the \"Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921\" (c. 103) was assented to. Sections 3 and 4 of this Act read :\n3. (1) Subsection (2) of section 39A, as enacted by section 13 of the \"Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921, Amendment Act, 1931,\" and amended by section 7 of the \"Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921, Amendment Act, 1936,\" is further amended by striking out the words \"in the case of every street-railway company on the amount of fares annually received upon its street-cars within the city\" in the ninth and tenth lines, and substituting therefor the following: \"in the case of the British Columbia Electric Railway Company, Limited, on the basic fare revenue as defined in an agreement between the city and the said Company, dated the thirtieth day of December, 1946, in respect of its street-cars, and trolley-coaches operated under such agreement.\"\n(2) Subsection (1) hereof shall not come into force and shall have no effect unless the agreement therein mentioned has been validated and confirmed by Statute of the Province, in which case it shall be deemed to have come into force and to have had effect on and from the first day of January, 1947.\n4. (1) Subsection (2) of section 39A, as enacted by section 3 of the \"Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921, Amendment Act, 1931,\" and amended by section 7 of the \"Vancouver Incorporation Act, 1921, Amendment Act, 1936,\" is further amended by striking out the words \"one and one-half\" in the second line, and substituting therefor the words \"two and one-half.\"\n(2) Subsection (4) of said section 39A is amended by striking out the words \"one and one-half\" in the eighth line, and substituting therefor the words \"two and one-half.\"\nThe question to be determined upon the present appeal is as to whether the rate of 2 1\/2 per cent imposed by section 4 of the 1947 amendment applies to the taxation of the respondent companies for the year 1947. Macfarlane, J. by whom the actions were tried considered that it did not and an appeal from his judgment was dismissed by the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal. For the appellant it is contended that the question is determined by the very terms of the section. As amended section 39A by subsection 1 provides that the described property of the respondents shall be liable to taxation as provided in subsection 2, which declares that they shall be taxed annually at the rate of 2 1\/2 per cent on the described revenues in lieu of all other taxes, and subsection 4 states that subsection 1 shall come into force and take effect on the first day of January, 1937. This language, it is said, is free from ambiguity and must be construed literally. If this be correct, not only would the respondents be found liable for the tax at the increased rate for the taxation year 1947 but, in the result, their liability would be declared in respect of the years 1937 to 1946 both inclusive. It is not sufficient, in my opinion, to say that this would be so manifestly unjust that the Legislature could not have intended such a result if, as contended for by the appellant, the language is so clear as to permit of no other reasonable meaning. It is not an answer to such a contention to say that the result thus reached would be absurd. As was pointed out by Cockburn, C.J. in Miller v. Salomons[8] , where the meaning of a statute is plain and clear the courts have nothing to do with its policy or impolicy, its justice or injustice: it is for them to administer it as they find it and that to take a different course is to abandon the office of judge and to assume the province of legislation. The rule is stated by Lord Esher, M.R. in The Queen v. Judge of City of London[9] , where he referred to what had been said by Sir George Jessel in The Alina[10] thus:\nJessel, M.R., says that the words of s. 2 are quite clear, and that, if the words of an Act of Parliament are clear, you must take them in their ordinary and natural meaning, unless that meaning produces a manifest absurdity. Now, I say that no such rule of construction was ever laid down before. If the words of an Act are clear, you must follow them, even though they lead to a manifest absurdity. The Court has nothing to do with the question whether the legislature has committed an absurdity. In my opinion, the rule has always been this-if the words of an Act admit of two interpretations, then they are not clear; and if one interpretation leads to an absurdity, and the other does not, the Court will conclude that the legislature did not intend to lead to an absurdity, and will adopt the other interpretation.\nThis language was expressly approved by Herschell, L.C. in Mersey Dock v. Turner[11] . Construing section 39A in its present form the terms of the Vancouver Incorporation Amendment Act of 1947, which authorized its amendment, must be considered. That statute not only changed the rate of the tax by section 4 but also in the case of the respondent B.C. Electric Railway Company Limited altered subsection 2 by providing that, in lieu of imposing the tax on the amount of fares annually received upon its street cars within the City, it should be imposed on the basic fare revenue as defined in the agreement of December 30, 1946, in respect of its street cars and trolley coaches operated under such agreement, and further that this change should not come into force unless the agreement was validated and approved by a statute of the province \"in which case it shall be deemed to have come into force and to have had effect on and from the first day of January, 1947.\" If the appellant's present contention were right the tax of 2 1\/2 per cent would be imposed upon the basic fare revenue from and after January 1, 1937, since if the amended rate became effective as of that date by reason of the concluding sentence in the amended section 39A, the tax must be computed upon the basic fare revenue if the section be construed literally. This would be in direct conflict with the terms of section 3 of the Vancouver Incorporation Amendment Act of 1947. As to the other respondents, it cannot, in my opinion, be fairly contended that whereas in the case of the street railway company the increased rate of taxation was not to affect its revenues prior to those received in the year 1947, they are to be taxed retroactively to January 1, 1937: the section may not be construed in one manner for the street railway company and in another for other companies affected.\nSubsection 1 of section 3 of the amending Act of 1947 must be read as if it were incorporated in section 39A and accordingly, in my opinion, the increased tax is not retroactive to January 1, 1937. By subsection 2 of section 39A, as it read following the amendment of 1936, the rate of 1 1\/2 per cent per annum was to continue in force from the 1st day of January, 1937, until the year 1937 inclusive \"and thereafter until amended by statute.\" The provision that the tax imposed by subsection 1 should come into force and take effect on the 1st day of January, 1937, read together with the provisions of subsection 2, should be construed as meaning that the rate thus imposed should continue after the year 1939 until it was amended by statute and, having been amended by the 1947 Act, thereafter ceased to be of any effect. This interpretation appears to me to be clearly what was intended by the Legislature. To interpret the statute in this manner is, in my view, to adopt and apply the principle stated by Turner, L.J. in Hawkins v. Gathercole[12] , which was referred to with approval by Lord Hatherley in Garnett v. Bradley[13] , and by Lord Blackburn in Bradlaugh v. Clarke[14] .\nIt is further contended for the appellant that in any event the revenues of the respondents subject to taxation for the year 1947 are liable to be taxed at the advanced rate since it is said the tax was imposed after April 3, 1947, when the amendment received royal assent. In support of this contention it is said that the rating by-law for the taxation year 1947 not having been passed until April 18 of that year the liability arose after the legislation came into force. As to this, it is my opinion that the liability of the respondents did not arise by virtue of the rating by-law or depend in any manner upon it. The liability is imposed by the statute and depends neither upon an assessment (since there was nothing to value) nor upon the ordinary municipal procedure for the imposition of taxation. I think the increased rate did not apply to the designated revenues of any of the respondents for the taxation year 1947. When by chapter 78 of the Statutes of 1931, assented to on April 1 of that year, section 39A was introduced into the charter the taxation was declared to be in force from the 1st day of January, 1932, and the return which the companies were required to file with the City Assessor on or before January 31 in the latter year was of the revenues for the year 1931. While the moneys here in dispute are for taxes imposed by the statute for the taxation year 1947, they are levied upon the revenues for the year 1946. In the case of the street railway company, until the amendment of 1947 the tax was imposed upon the amount of fares annually received upon its street cars within the City. Since the section as amended in 1947 imposes the increased rate only upon the basic fare revenue, as defined in the agreement, in respect of its street cars and trolley coaches, and since the provision subjecting this revenue to the increased tax is by virtue of subsection 2 of section 3 of the Vancouver Incorporation Amendment Act, 1947, effective only as and from January 1, 1947, there was no statutory authority, other than the section as it stood prior to its amendment, under which the \"amount of fares annually received upon its street cars within the City\" in 1946 could be taxed. The tax on the basic fare revenue becomes effective only as of January 1, 1947, and the rate of 2 1\/2 per cent could for the first time be imposed only for the taxation year 1948. The company, it must be presumed, then made the required return of its basic fare revenue for the year 1947 and was taxed upon it. As, in my opinion, the section must be construed in the same manner in so far as it affects each of the respondent companies, the increased rate should, in my opinion, be held as not applicable to the tax levied in 1947 upon their 1946 revenues.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Arthur E.

Neither is capable therefore of delegating to the other the powers with which it has been vested nor of receiving from the other the powers with which the other has been vested.\nC.P.R. v.

Magone K.C. for the Attorney General of Ontario.\nJohn C. Osborne for the Attorney General of Alberta.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014This is a reference by the Lieutenant Governor in Council of the Province of Nova Scotia, submitting to the Supreme Court of that Province the question of the constitutional validity of a Bill, Number 136, entitled \"An Act respecting the delegation of jurisdiction from the Parliament of Canada to the Legislature of Nova Scotia and vice versa.\"\nBy virtue of this Bill, if it should come into force, by proclamation, as therein provided, the Lieutenant Governor in Council, may from time to time delegate to and with draw from the Parliament of Canada authority to make laws in relation to any matter relating to employment in any industry, work or undertaking in respect of which such matter is, by section 92 of The British North America Act, 1867, exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Legislature of Nova Scotia. It provides that any laws so made by the Parliament of Canada shall, while such delegation is in force, have the same effect as if enacted by the Legislature.\nThe Bill also provides that if and when the Parliament of Canada shall have delegated to the Legislature of the Province of Nova Scotia authority to make laws in relation to any matter relating to employment in any industry, work or undertaking in respect of which such matter is, under the provisions of The British North America Act, 1867, exclusively within the legislative jurisdiction of such Parliament, the Lieutenant Governor in Council, while such delegation is in force, may, by proclamation, from time to time apply any or all of the provisions of any Act in relation to a matter relating to employment in force in the Province of Nova Scotia to any such industry, work, or undertaking.\nFinally, the Bill enacts that if and when the Parliament of Canada shall have delegated to the Legislature of the Province of Nova Scotia authority to make laws in relation to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes by the imposing of a retail sales tax of the nature of indirect taxation, the Lieutenant Governor in Council, while such delegation is in force, may impose such a tax of such amount not exceeding three per cent (3%) of the retail price as he deems necessary, in respect of any commodity to which such delegation extends and may make regulations providing for the method of collecting any such tax.\nThe provisions of the Bill, therefore, deal with employment in industries, works, or undertakings, exclusively within the legislative jurisdiction in the one case of the Legislature of the Province of Nova Scotia and in the other case within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, and it also deals with the raising of revenue for provincial purposes by means of indirect taxation.\nIn each of the supposed cases either the Parliament of Canada, or the Legislature of Nova Scotia, would be adopting legislation concerning matters which have not been attributed to it but to the other by the constitution of the country.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc, to which the matter was submitted, answered that such legislation was not within the competence of the Legislature of Nova Scotia, except that Doull J. dissented and expressed the opinion that the Bill was constitutionally valid, subject to the limitations stated in his answers. I agree with the answers given by the majority of the Judges in the Supreme Court en banc.\nThe Parliament of Canada and the Legislatures of the several Provinces are sovereign within their sphere defined by The British North America Act, but none of them has the unlimited capacity of an individual. They can exercise only the legislative powers respectively given to them by sections 91 and 92 of the Act, and these powers must be found in either of these sections.\nThe constitution of Canada does not belong either to Parliament, or to the Legislatures; it belongs to the country and it is there that the citizens of the country will find the protection of the rights to which they are entitled. It is part of that protection that Parliament can legislate only on the subject matters referred to it by section 91 and that each Province can legislate exclusively on the subject matters referred to it by section 92. The country is entitled to insist that legislation adopted under section 91 should be passed exclusively by the Parliament of Canada in the same way as the people of each Province are entitled to insist that legislation concerning the matters enumerated in section 92 should come exclusively from their respective Legislatures. In each case the Members elected to Parliament or to the Legislatures are the only ones entrusted with the power and the duty to legislate concerning the subjects exclusively distributed by the constitutional Act to each of them.\nNo power of delegation is expressed either in section 91 or in section 92, nor, indeed, is there to be found the power of accepting delegation from one body to the other; and I have no doubt that if it had been the intention to give such powers it would have been expressed in clear and unequivocal language. Under the scheme of the British North America Act there were to be, in the words of Lord Atkin in The Labour Conventions Reference ([2]), \"water-tight compartments which are an essential part of the original structure.\"\nNeither legislative bodies, federal or provincial, possess any portion of the powers respectively vested in the other and they cannot receive it by delegation. In that connection the word \"exclusively\" used both in section 91 and in section 92 indicates a settled line of demarcation and it does not belong to either Parliament, or the Legislatures, to confer powers upon the other. (St. Catharine's Milling Co. v. The Queen, ([3]), by Strong J.; C.P.R. v. Notre Dame de Bonsecours Parish ([4])).\nDelegations such as were dealt with In re Gray ([5]) and in The Chemical Reference ([6]), were delegations to a body subordinate to Parliament and were of a character different from the delegation meant by the Bill now submitted to the Court.\nI need hardly add that these reasons apply only to the questions as put and which ought to be answered in the negative. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nKerwin J.:\u2014I agree with the majority of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc that Bill No. 136 of the adjourned Meeting of the Second Session of the Forty third General Assembly of the Legislature of Nova Scotia, intituled \"An Act respecting the Delegation of Jurisdiction from the Parliament of Canada to the Legislature of Nova Scotia and vice versa\" would not be constitutionally valid if enacted into law and that the answer to each of the six questions submitted to the Court by the Lieutenant Governor in Council is in the negative.\nAt the outset it should be emphasized that we are not concerned with delegation in the sense in which that expression is used in the Chemicals Reference Case ([7]), or in the sense that it may be said that a provincial legislature in its various municipal Acts delegates to municipal authorities power to enact by-laws and regulations. Nor are we dealing with a provincial statute stating, as some do, that certain parts of the Criminal Code shall apply.\nIn the provincial courts expressions may be found favouring the view pressed upon us in this case. So far as this Court is concerned, Davies J. does say in Ouimet v. Bazin ([8]): \"As to the power of the Dominion Parliament to delegate its powers I have no doubt.\" This statement was obiter and if it means more than that Parliament could delegate as it did in the Chemicals Reference case, it is. contrary to what had already been said in Citizen's Insurance Co. v. Parsons ([9]), by Taschereau J. at 317: \"But the Federal Parliament cannot amend the British North America Act, nor give, either expressly or impliedly to the local legislatures, a power which the Imperial Act does not give them. This is clear, and has always been held in this court to be the law\", and by Gwynne J. at 348. The point was not decided in Ouimet v. Bazin.\nAs to the Judicial Committee, a suggestion to the effect now contended for, made by counsel in C.P.R. v. Corporation of the Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours ([10]), was dismissed by Lord Watson and Lord Davey as follows, according to the verbatim report of the argument referred to in Lefroy's Canada's Federal System, 1913, page 70, note 10(a):\u2014\nLord Watson:\nThe Dominion cannot give jurisdiction, or leave jurisdiction, with the province. The provincial parliament cannot give legislative jurisdiction to the Dominion parliament. If they have it, either one or the other of them, they have it by virtue of the Act of 1867. I think we must get rid of the idea that either one or the other can enlarge the jurisdiction of the other or surrender jurisdiction. To which Lord Davey adds: or curtail.\nIn Lord's Day Alliance of Canada v. Attorney General for Manitoba ([11]), the Judicial Committee affirmed' the Court of Appeal for Manitoba and held that a Manitoba statute of 1923 providing that it should be lawful to run or conduct Sunday excursions to resorts within the province was intra vires. This statute was passed in pursuance of the exception in the Dominion Lord's Day Act making it a punishable offence to run or conduct Sunday excursions \"except as provided by any provincial Act or law now or hereafter in force.\" It was held that the Manitoba statute was merely permissive, their Lordships adopting what Duff J. had said in Ouimet v. Bazin at page 526.\nAt page 394 of the Lord's Day Alliance report, their Lordships say:\u2014\nIn this view of the matter it becomes unnecessary for their Lordships to consider, as some of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal have done, whether such Provincial legislation as that now in question may be justified as being in effect Dominion legislation by delegation or reference. They prefer, without saying more on that matter, to justify it on the grounds they have set forth. The Court of Appeal judgment is found in [1923] 3 D.L.R. 495, and at page 507, Fullerton J.A., after stating that it was strenuously maintained that the Dominion Parliament could not delegate its authority to legislate, stated that this was inconceivable,\u2014referring to in Re Gray ([12]); but it should be noted that in the Gray case there was an entirely different matter under consideration. Dennistoun J.A. at 510, referring to counsel's argument that the Dominion could not delegate the power to the provinces of enacting or repealing criminal law states that it would not seem to him that there was any delegation. However, while he deemed it unnecessary to deal further with the point, he stated that there were many recorded instances of regulating delegated powers in Canada but the examples he gives are in the same class as in Re Gray or similar thereto. As has been pointed out, the Judicial Committee declined to deal with the argument.\nThe reasons of their Lordships in In Re The Initiative and Referendum Act ([13]) are instructive. The actual decision was that the Initiative and Referendum Act of Manitoba was invalid since it would compel the Lieutenant Governor to submit a proposed law to a body of voters totally distinct from the Legislature of which he was the constitutional head and would render him powerless to prevent the same becoming an actual law as approved by those voters. However, in delivering the judgment on behalf of the Committee, Viscount Haldane, after referring to the analogy between the British Constitution and that of Canada, and disposing of the question in the manner indicated, proceeds at page 945 to state that he would not deal finally with another difficulty that those who contended for the validity of the Act in question had to meet but thought it right to advert to it. After pointing out that a body with a power of legislation on the subjects entrusted to it so ample as that enjoyed by a Provincial Legislature could while preserving its own capacity intact seek the assistance of subordinate agencies as had been done in Hodge v. The Queen ([14]). Viscount Haldane continues:\u2014\"but it does not follow that it (i.e. a Provincial Legislature) can create and endow with its own capacity a new legislative power not created by the Act to which it owes its own existence.\"\nThe British North America Act divides legislative jurisdiction between the Parliament of Canada and the Legislatures of the Provinces and there is no way in which these bodies may agree to a different division. The fact that section 94 was considered necessary to provide in certain contingencies for the uniformity in some of the provinces of laws relating to property and civil rights and court procedure, indicates that an agreement for such a delegation as is here contended for was never intended. To permit of such an agreement would be inserting into the Act a power that is certainly not stated and one that should not be inferred. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nTaschereau J.:\u2014In August, 1947, the Attorney-General of Nova Scotia introduced in the House of Assembly for the Province, Bill No. 136 which was read a first time and ordered to be read a second time upon a future day. This Bill reads as follows:\nBE IT ENACTED by the Governor and Assembly as follows:\n1. This Act may be cited as The Delegation of Legislative Jurisdiction Act.\n2. The Governor in Council may, by proclamation, from time to time delegate to and withdraw from the Parliament of Canada authority to make laws in relation to any matter relating to employment in any industry, work or undertaking in respect of which such matter is, by Section 92 of The British North America Act, 1867, exclusively within the legislative jurisdiction of this Legislature and any laws so made by the said Parliament shall, while such delegation is in force, have the same effect as if enacted by this Legislature.\n3. If and when the Parliament of Canada shall have delegated to the Legislature of this Province authority to make laws in relation to any matter relating to employment in any industry, work or under taking in respect of which such matter is, under the provisions of The British North America Act, 1867, exclusively within the legislative jurisdiction of such Parliament, the Governor in Council, while such delegation is in force, may, by proclamation, from time to time apply any or all the provisions of any Act in relation to a matter relating to employment in force in this Province to any such industry, work or undertaking.\n4. If and when the Parliament of Canada shall have delegated to the Legislature of this Province authority to make laws in relation to the raising of a Revenue for Provincial Purposes by the imposing of a retail. sales tax of the nature of indirect taxation, the Governor-in- Council while such delegation is in force, may impose such a tax of such amount not exceeding three per cent (3%) of the retail price as he deems necessary, in respect of any commodity to which such delegation extends and may make regulations providing for the method of collecting any such tax.\n5. This Act shall come into force on, from and after, but not before, such day as the Governor-in-Council orders and declares by proclamation.\nThe validity of this proposed legislation was submitted to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and the majority of the Court were of the opinion that the Bill was not constitutionally valid, and answered the six questions in the negative. The questions put to the Court under and by virtue of Chapter 226 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1923, were the following:\u2014\n1. Is the said Bill constitutionally valid or in part, and if in part, in what respect?\n2. Is it within the competence of the Parliament of Canada to delegate to the Legislature of Nova Scotia authority to impose a tax in the nature of indirect taxation, as referred to in Section 4 of the said Bill?\n3. In the event of such a delegation being made, is it competent for the Legislature of Nova Scotia to impose such a tax?\n4. Is it within the competence of the said Parliament to delegate to the said Legislature authority to make laws in relation to employment matters otherwise within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of such Parliament as referred to in Section 3 of said Bill?\n5. Is it within the competence of the said Legislature to delegate or to empower the Governor in Council to delegate authority to such Parliament to make laws in relation to employment matters otherwise within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of such Legislature, as referred to in Section 2 of the said Bill?\n6. In the event of such a delegation as is referred to in Sections 2 and 3 of the said Bill being made, is it within the competence of (a) the said Legislature, and (b) the said Parliament, respectively, to make laws in relation to such employment matters?\nThese questions, although limited to indirect taxation and to laws in relation to employment matters, cover a much wider field. For if it is within the powers of Parliament and of the Legislatures to confer upon each other by consent, a legislative authority which they do not other wise possess, to deal with the subject matters found in the questions submitted, the same powers would naturally exist to enact laws affecting all the classes of subjects enumerated in Sections 91 and 92 of the B.N.A. Act. I may say at the outset that I am of the opinion that the conclusion arrived at by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia is right.\nThe British North America Act, 1867, and amendments has defined the powers that are to be exercised by the Dominion Parliament and by the Legislatures of the various provinces. There are fields where the Dominion has exclusive jurisdiction, while others are reserved to the provinces. This division of powers has received the sanction of the Imperial Parliament, which was then and is still the sole competent authority to make any alterations to its own laws. If Bill 136 were intra vires, the Dominion Parliament could delegate its powers to any or all the provinces, to legislate on commerce, banking, bankruptcy, militia and defence, issue of paper money, patents, copyrights, indirect taxation, and all other matters enumerated in Section 91; and on the other hand, the Legislatures could authorize the Dominion to pass laws in relation to property and civil rights, municipal institutions, education, etc. etc., all matters outside the jurisdiction reserved to the Dominion Parliament. The powers of Parliament and of the Legislatures strictly limited by the B.N.A. Act, would thus be considerably enlarged, and I have no doubt that this cannot be done, even with the joint consent of Parliament and of the Legislatures.\nIt is a well settled proposition of law that jurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent. None of these bodies can be vested directly or indirectly with powers which have been denied them by the B.N.A. Act, and which there fore are not within their constitutional jurisdiction.\nThis question has often been the subject of comments by eminent text writers, and has also been definitely settled by numerous authoritative judicial pronouncements.\nLefroy Canada's Federal System (1913 at p. 70) cites the words of Lord Watson on the argument in C.P.R. v. Bonsecours ([15]):\u2014\nThe Dominion cannot give jurisdiction, or leave jurisdiction, with the province. The provincial parliament cannot give legislative juris diction to the Dominion parliament. If they have it, either one or the other of them, they have it by virtue of the Act of 1867. I think we must get rid of the idea that either one or the other can enlarge the jurisdiction of the other or surrender jurisdiction. To which Lord Davey adds: \"or curtail.\"\nClement \"The Law of the Canadian Constitution\" 3rd ed., dealing with the same subject, says at page 380:\u2014\nIt is equally clear upon authority that a federal statute cannot enlarge the ambit of provincial authority as fixed by the British North America Act. And he states at page 382:\u2014\nBut, it is conceived, there is nothing in all this to give any countenance to the notion that by Canadian legislation, federal or provincial or both, a readjustment of the respective spheres of legislative authority as fixed by the British North America Act can be brought about; that, for example, the Dominion parliament can confer upon a provincial assembly any power of legislation not possessed by such assembly under the imperial statute. No such constituent power has been given by the Act to either legislature. It is not covered by any affirmative words and is radically repugnant to the principle underlying the use of the mutually restrictive word \"exclusive\" as applicable to the two competing groups of class-enumerations. Provincial legislation which, ex hypothesi, requires federal legislation to support it is not legislation at all.\nIn The Citizens' and The Queen Ins. Cos. v. Parsons ([16]), Mr. Justice Taschereau expresses his views as follows:\u2014\nThe Constitutional Act does not, as I read it, bear an interpretation inevitably leading to such anomalous consequences; the powers of the federal authority cannot, to such an extent, be dependent upon the consent and good will of the provincial authorities.\nAnd at page 317, he says:\u2014\nBut the Federal parliament cannot amend the British North America Act, nor give, either expressly or impliedly, to the local legislatures, a power which the Imperial Act does not give them. This is clear and has always been held in this court to be the law.\nAnd, in the same case, at page 348, Mr. Justice Gwynne also says:\u2014\nHow the species of legislation which appears upon the statute books, upon the subject of insurance and insurance companies, came to be recognized (by which it would seem as if the parliament and the legislatures had been attempting to make among themselves a partition of jurisdiction, for which the B.N.A. Act gives no warrant whatever), I confess appears to me to be very strange, for it surely cannot admit of a doubt that no act of the Dominion Parliament can give to the local legislatures over any subject which, by the B.N.A. Act, is placed exclusively under the control of parliament, and as the parliament cannot by Act or acquiescence transfer to the local legislatures any subject placed by the B.N.A. Act under the exclusive control of parliament, so neither can it take from the local legislatures any subject placed by the same authority under their exclusive control.\nIn St. Catharines Milling Co. v. The Queen ([17]), Mr. Justice Strong as he then was, says:\u2014\nThat Parliament has no power to divest the Dominion in favour of the Provinces of a legislative power conferred on it by the British North America Act is, I think, clear. More recently in Rex v. Zaslavsky ([18]), the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal held as follows:\u2014\nA Province cannot enlarge the jurisdiction of Parliament or surrender jurisdiction belonging exclusively to the Province. Since the control and regulation of sales and purchases of live stock and live stock products lies entirely within provincial boundaries it is ultra vires and a conviction under the Act will be quashed.\nThe Manitoba Court of Appeal in Rex v. Brodsky et al. ([19]), held as follows:\u2014\nNeither the Dominion nor the Province can delegate to each other powers they do not expressly possess under the B.N.A. Act.\nThe Alberta Supreme Court in Rex v. Thorsby Traders Ltd. ([20]), without delivering written reasons, stated that they followed Rex v. Zaslavsky cited supra.\nAll these authorities show clearly to my mind that Bill No. 136 is ultra vires and that the argument of the appellants cannot prevail.\nIt is submitted on behalf of the appellants that in numerous cases the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and the Courts of this country have admitted the principle of delegation of powers. In support of that proposition the following cases have been cited to the Court: Hodge v. The Queen ([21]), In Re Gray ([22]), Shannon v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board ([23]), Chemicals Reference ([24]).\nThese cases differ fundamentally from the present one. There is no doubt, as it has been very often recognized by the Courts, that Parliament or a provincial legislation may in certain cases delegate some of its powers.\nFor instance, in the Gray case, Mr. Justice Anglin said at page 176:\u2014\nA complete abdication by Parliament of its legislative functions is something so inconceivable that the constitutionality of an attempt to do anything of the kind need not be considered. Short of such an abdication, any limited delegation would seem to be within the ambit of a legislative jurisdiction certainly as wide as that of which it has been said by in controvertible authority that it is \"as plenary and as ample * * * as the Imperial Parliament in the plenitude of its powers possessed and could bestow.\" In Shannon v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board ([25]) at page 722 Lord Atkin said:\nThe third objection is that it is not within the powers of the Provincial Legislature to delegate so-called legislative powers to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, or to give him powers of further delegation. This objection appears to their Lordships subversive of the rights which the Provincial Legislature enjoys while dealing with matters falling within the classes of subjects in relation to which the constitution has granted legislative powers. Within its appointed sphere the Provincial Legislature is as supreme as any other Parliament; and it is unnecessary to try to enumerate the innumerable occasions on which Legislatures, Provincial, Dominion and Imperial, have entrusted various persons and bodies with similar powers to those contained in this Act.\nBut we are not dealing here with a similar situation. In the Gray case, the delegation was given by Parliament to the Executive Government. In the Hodge and Shannon cases, the delegation was to authorize Boards of Commissioners to enact regulations. In the Chemicals case, the delegation was to the Governor in Council, who by regulation appointed a controller of chemicals. In all these cases of delegation, the authority delegated its powers to subordinate Boards for the purpose of carrying legislative enactments into operation.\nIt is true that in Ouimet v. Bazin ([26]), Mr. Justice Davies said :\u2014\nAs to the power of the Dominion Parliament so to delegate its power, I have no doubt.\nI agree with Chief Justice Chisholm of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia that this observation is an \"obiter\" which is not concurred in by the other members of the Court who heard the appeal, and with respect I may say, that it is not founded upon any authority.\nIn Clement, \"Canadian Constitution\" cited supra, at pages 380, 381 and 382, the learned author deals with this subject and does not contest the right of a sovereign Legislature to delegate to a subordinate body some part of its legislative functions and, as the Parliament of Canada and the Assemblies of the several Provinces are all sovereign Legislatures within their respective spheres, the right to so delegate is beyond question. And, not only can a sovereign Legislature delegate part of its legislative functions, but it may also confer power upon a subordinate agency to make regulations for the better carrying out in detail of the enactment. But the learned author proceeds to say that there is nothing in all this to give countenance to the notion that a readjustment of the respective spheres of legislative authority, as fixed by the British North America Act, can be brought about.\nLefroy in \"Legislative Power in Canada\" at page 242, expresses the view with which I agree, that the Federal Parliament cannot amend the British North America Act, nor either expressly or impliedly take away from, or give to, the provincial Legislatures a power which the Imperial Act does, or does not give them; and he adds that the same is the case, mutatis mutandis, with the Provincial Legislatures. At page 689, the same author adds that within the area and limits of subjects mentioned in Section 92 of the British North America Act, the provincial Legislatures are supreme and have the same authority as the Imperial Parliament or the Dominion would have under like circumstances, to confide to a municipal institution or body of its own creation, authority to make by-laws or regulations as to subjects specified in the enactment and with the object of carrying the enactment into operation and effect. This proposition rests upon the language and decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Hodge v. The Queen, cited supra.\nIt will be seen therefore that as a result of all these authorities and pronouncements, Parliament or the Legislatures may delegate in certain cases their powers to sub ordinate agencies, but that it has never been held that the Parliament of Canada or any of the Legislatures can abdicate their powers and invest for the purpose of legislation, bodies which by the very terms of the B.N.A. Act are not empowered to accept such delegation, and to legislate on such matters.\nIt has been further argued that as a result of the delegation made by the Federal Government to the Provinces, the laws enacted by the Provinces as delegates would be federal laws and that they would, therefore, be constitutionally valid. With this proposition I cannot agree. These laws would not then be enacted \"with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons\", and would not be assented to by the Governor General, but by the Lieutenant Governor, who has no power to do so. Moreover, as already stated, such a right has been denied the Provinces by the B.N.A. Act.\nIf the proposed legislation were held to be valid, the whole scheme of the Canadian Constitution would be entirely defeated. The framers of the B.N.A. Act thought wisely that Canada should not be a unitary state, but it would be converted into one, as Mr. Justice Hall says, if all the Provinces empowered Parliament to make laws with respect to all matters exclusively assigned to them. Moreover, it is clear that the delegation of legislative powers by Parliament to the ten Provinces on matters enumerated in Section 91 of the B.N.A. Act could bring about different criminal laws, different banking and bankruptcy laws, different military laws, different postal laws, different currency laws, all subjects in relation to which it has been thought imperative that uniformity should prevail throughout Canada.\nFor the above reasons, I have come to the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nRand J.:\u2014This appeal is from a majority judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in which negative answers were given to certain questions referred to it by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. They arise out of a bill introduced into the Provincial Legislature which purports to authorize the delegation of certain legislative power to Parliament and the acceptance and exercise of the converse delegation from Parliament; and their purpose is to obtain the opinion of the Court on the competency of Legislature and Parliament to such delegation. Both the questions and the text of the bill are set out in the reasons of other members of the Court and I will not repeat them.\nThe considerations pertinent to the answers to be given are to be found in the circumstances of the creation and evolution of constitutional self-government under the British Crown. The devolution of legislative power in the administration of the Empire, issuing in the Common wealth relations of today, evolved a characteristic polity through the investment, either under the prerogative or by statute of the Imperial Parliament, of jurisdiction in local legislative bodies. By the Confederation Act of 1867, that jurisdiction and its concomitant executive authority were committed to Parliament and Legislature in as plenary and ample manner \"as the Imperial Parliament in the plenitude of its power * * * could bestow\"; Hodge v. The Queen ([27]). The essential quality of legislation enacted by these bodies is that it is deemed to be law of the legislatures of Canada as a self-governing political organization and not law of the Imperial Parliament. It was law within the Empire and is law within the Commonwealth; but it is not law as if enacted at Westminster, though its source of authority is derived from that Parliament.\nThe distinction between the status of such a legislature and a delegate arises from the difference between an endowment by a paramount legislature of an original, self-responsible, and exclusive jurisdiction to enact laws, subject, it may be, to restrictions and limitations, and the entrustment of the exercise of legislative action to an agency of the entrusting authority. The latter is a present continuing authority to effect provisions of law which are attributed to the delegating power. The difference between these conceptions is of substance, a difference lying in the scope and nature of the powers conferred and retained.\nThe extent of delegation depends upon the language of the grant, but the full original powers are retained: Huth v. Clarke ([28]); Wills J. at page 395:\u2014\nDelegation, as that word is generally used, does not imply a parting with powers by the person who grants the delegation, but points rather to the conferring of an authority to do things which otherwise that person would have to do himself * * * It is never used, by legal writers, so far as I am aware, as implying that the delegating person parts with his powers so as to denude himself of his rights. If it is correct to use the word in the way in which it is used in the maxim as generally understood, the word \"delegate\" means little more than an agent.\nWhether the authority of sub-delegation is conferred depends likewise on the language of the grant in the framework of the circumstances: The Chemicals Reference ([29]). That Canadian legislatures may delegate has long been settled: Hodge v. The Queen, (supra). Notwithstanding the plenary nature of the jurisdiction enjoyed by them, it was conceded that neither Parliament nor Legislature can either transfer its constitutional authority to the other or create a new legislative organ in a relation to it similar to that between either of these bodies and the Imperial Parliament. On the former, the observation of Lord Watson in the argument in C.P.R. v. Notre Dame de Bonsecours ([30]), as reported in Lefroy, Canada's Federal System (1913) p. 70 note 10(a):\u2014\nThe Dominion cannot give jurisdiction or leave jurisdiction with the Province. The provincial parliament cannot give legislative jurisdiction to the Dominion parliament. If they had it, either one or other of them, they have it by virtue of the Act of 1867. I think that we must get rid of the idea that either one or other can enlarge the jurisdiction of the other or surrender jurisdiction.\nseems to me, if I may say so, to be incontrovertible; and the latter is settled by the judgment of the Judicial Committee in The Queen v. Burah ([31]). There are to be kept in mind, also, certain conditions to the procedure of enactment such as, for example, the participation in legislation of the Sovereign through the Lieutenant-Governor as exemplified in In re The Initiative and Referendum Act ([32]), and the provisions of sections 53 and 54 of the Act of 1867 dealing with taxation and the appropriation of the public revenue by Parliament.\nOn the argument, discussion as to the precise delegate, whether the Legislature as such or the individuals comprising it, tended to confuse the issue raised by the proposed bill. The language of the latter leaves us in no doubt of what is intended: it is the Legislature of the Province or Parliament acting as such which is intended to exercise the delegated authority, and on this footing the questions are to be answered.\nCan either of these legislative bodies, then, confer upon the other or can the latter accept and exercise in such a subsidiary manner legislative power vested in the former? They are bodies of co-ordinate rank; in constitutional theory, legislative enactment is that of the Sovereign in Parliament and in Legislature, to each of which, as legislative organs of a federal union, has been given exclusive authority over specified matters in a distribution of total legislative subject-matter. Delegation has its source in the necessities of legislation; it has become an essential to completeness and adaptability of much of statutory law; but if one legislature is adequate, by its own action, to enactment, so, surely, is the other; in the proposed bill, there is no suggestion of authorizing Parliament, as dele gate, in turn to sub-delegate to agencies of its own, and the practical ground of delegation is absent. But even where the broadest authority is intended, can we seriously imagine the Imperial Parliament, in the implication of the power to delegate, intending to include delegation by and to each other? These bodies were created solely for the purposes of the constitution by which each, in the traditions and conventions of the English Parliamentary system, was to legislate, in accordance with its debate and judgment, on the matters assigned to it and on no other. To imply a power to shift this debate and this judgment of either to the other is to permit the substance of transfer to take place, a dealing with and in jurisdiction utterly foreign to the conception of a federal organization.\nSo exercising delegated powers would not only be in compatible with the constitutional function with which Nova Scotia is endowed and an affront to constitutional principle and practice, it would violate, also, the interest in the substance of Dominion legislation which both the people and the legislative bodies of the other provinces possess. In a unitary state, that question does not arise; but it seems to be quite evident that such legislative absolutism, except in respects in which, by the terms express or implied of the constituting Act, only one jurisdiction is concerned, is incompatible with federal reality. If a matter affects only one, it would not be a subject for delegation to the other; matters of possible delegation, by that fact, imply a common interest. Dominion legislation in relation to employment in Nova Scotia enacted by the legislature may affect interests outside of Nova Scotia; by delegation Nova Scotia might impose an indirect tax upon citizens of Alberta in respect of matters arising in Nova Scotia; or it might place restrictions on foreign or interprovincial trade affecting Nova Scotia which impinge on interests in Ontario. The incidence of laws of that nature is intended by the constitution to be determined by the deliberations of Parliament and not of any Legislature. In the generality of actual delegation to its own agencies, Parliament, recognizing the need of the legislation, lays down the broad scheme and indicates the principles, purposes and scope of the subsidiary details to be supplied by the delegate: under the mode of enactment now being considered, the real and substantial analysis and weighing of the political considerations which would decide the actual provisions adopted, would be given by persons chosen to represent local interests.\nSince neither is a creature nor a subordinate body of the other, the question is not only or chiefly whether one can delegate, but whether the other can accept. Delegation implies subordination and in Hodge v. The Queen, (supra), the following observations (at p. 132) appear:\u2014\nWithin these limits of subjects and area the local legislature is supreme, and has the same authority as the Imperial Parliament, or the parliament of the Dominion, would have had under like circumstances to confide to a municipal institution or body of its own creation authority to make by-laws or resolutions as to subjects specified in the enactment, and with the object of carrying the enactment into operation and effect.\n* * *\nIt was argued at the bar that a legislature committing important regulations to agents or delegates effaces itself. That is not so. It retains its powers intact, and can, whenever it pleases, destroy the agency it has created and set up another, or take the matter directly into his own hands. How far it shall seek the aid of subordinate agencies, and how long it shall continue them, are matters for each legislature, and not for Courts of Law, to decide.\nSubordination, as so considered, is constitutional subordination and not that implied in the relation of delegate. Sovereign states can and do confer and accept temporary transfers of jurisdiction under which they enact their own laws within the territory of others; but the exercise of delegation by one for another would be an incongruity; for the enactments of a state are of its own laws, not those of another state.\nSubordination implies duty: delegation is not made to be accepted or acted upon at the will of the delegate; it is ancillary to legislation which the appropriate legislature thinks desirable; and a duty to act either by enacting or by exercising a conferred discretion not, at the particular time, to act, rests upon the delegate. No such duty could be imposed upon or accepted by a co-ordinate legislature and the proposed bill does no more than to proffer authority to be exercised by the delegate solely of its own volition and, for its own purposes, as a discretionary privilege. Even in the case of virtually unlimited delegation as under the Poor Act of England, assuming that degree to be open to Canadian legislatures, the delegate is directly amenable to his principal for his execution of the authority.\nIn another aspect the proposal is equally objectionable. Would it be within constitutional propriety for the representatives both of the Sovereign and of the people of Nova Scotia, to appropriate their legislative ritual to the enactment of a law not of Nova Scotia, but of Canada? Acting as a subordinate body, the recital in the usual formula of enactment would be false; and the Lieutenant-Governor as well as the members of the Legislature could decline to participate in such roles.\nThe argument, in relation to taxation, seemed to assume a power in the Dominion to tax for interests or purposes local to Nova Scotia which by a delegation to that province could be more appropriately exercised; but the language of Lord Atkin in the Unemployment Insurance Reference ([33]), would appear to reject such a view.\nThe practical consequences of the proposed measure, a matter which the Courts may take into account, entail the danger, through continued exercise of delegated power, of prescriptive claims based on conditions and relations established in reliance on the delegation. Possession here as elsewhere would be nine points of law and disruptive controversy might easily result. The power of revocation might in fact become no more feasible, practically, than amendment of the Act of 1867 of its own volition by the British Parliament.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKellock J.:\u2014All of the questions which are the subject matter of the reference dealt with by the judgment in appeal involve the one question as to the competence either of Parliament or a provincial Legislature to delegate, one to the other, authority to enact legislation exclusively within the power of the delegating authority under the terms of the British North America Act. In my opinion, the point does not lend itself to extended discussion. Under the statute the powers committed to Parliament and to the Provincial Legislatures respectively are, as already stated, exclusive. If therefore Parliament, for example, were to purport to authorize a Provincial Legislature to exercise legislative jurisdiction assigned exclusively to the former, any exercise of such authority by the latter would in fact be an attempt \"to make laws\" in relation to a matter \"assigned exclusively\" to Parliament, and consequently prohibited to the Provincial Legislature. In the same way, if a Provincial Legislature purported to authorize Parliament to legislate with respect to any of the matters enumerated in section 92, and Parliament attempted to act upon such authorization, it would similarly be attempting to \"make laws\" in relation to a matter assigned exclusively to the Provinces.\nDuring the argument in C.P.R. v. Notre Dame ([34]), Lord Watson, with the apparent approval of Lord Davey, said:\nThe Dominion cannot give jurisdiction, or leave jurisdiction with the province. The provincial parliament cannot give legislative jurisdiction to the Dominion parliament. If they have it, either one or the other of them, they have it by virtue of the Act of 1867. I think we must get rid of the idea that either one or the other can enlarge the jurisdiction of the other or surrender jurisdiction.\n(see Lefroy, Canada's Federal System, 1913, p. 70, Note).\nThe same view had been earlier expressed by Strong J., as he then was, in St. Catharines Milling Company v. The Queen ([35]).\nDavies J. as he then was, in Ouimet v. Bazin ([36]), indicated perhaps a contrary view at page 513, but in Lord's Day Alliance of Canada v. Attorney General for Manitoba ([37]), the Judicial Committee explained the real basis of provincial Lord's Day legislation as not involving any delegation of legislative jurisdiction by the Dominion, and for that reason the Committee refrained from dealing with the question now under discussion.\nCounsel for the Attorney General for Ontario in his argument referred to the language of Lord Phillimore in Caron v. The King ([38]), where, in referring to taxation powers of Parliament and the provincial legislatures respectively, his Lordship quoted from an earlier judgment of the Committee in Bank of Toronto v. Lambe ([39]), as follows:\nTheir Lordships adhere to that view, and hold that, as regards direct taxation within the province to raise revenue for provincial purposes, that subject falls wholly within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures.\nLord Phillimore continued:\nBoth sections of the Act of Parliament must be construed together; and it matters not whether the principle to be applied is that the particular provision in head 2 of s. 92 effects a deduction from the general provision in head 3 of s. 91, or whether the principle be that head 3 of s. 91 is confined to Dominion taxes for Dominion purposes.\nThe only occasion on which it could be necessary to consider which of these two principles was to guide, would be in the not very probable event of the Parliament of Canada desiring to raise money for provincial purposes by indirect taxation. It might then become necessary to consider whether the taxation could be supported, because the power to impose it, given by head 3 of s. 91, had not been taken out of the general power by the particular provision, or because though not given by head 3, it was given as a residual power by the other parts of s. 91. But no such question arises now.\nIn considering the power of Parliament \"to raise money for provincial purposes by indirect taxation\", Lord Phillimore was not considering that power as the subject matter of delegation from a provincial legislature at all, such legislature having no such power.\nAppellant's contention would appear to be contrary to the whole theory of the Constitution Act under which, to adopt the language of the Quebec Resolutions, the central government was to be \"charged\" with matters of common interest to the whole country, and the local governments \"charged\" with the control of local matters in their respective sections. The effect of the statute is that each is \"charged\" with their respective responsibilities to the exclusion of the other.\nCounsel for the appellants sought to avoid the above conclusion by contending that if either Parliament or a provincial legislature should act under a power delegated by the other, such act would not be the act of a legislature but that of personae designatae, their act being in reality that of the delegating authority.\nIn my opinion, this contention is really not open upon the questions submitted, for the reason that in the questions themselves, as well as in Bill No. 136, the delegation is invariably described as a delegation to \"the Legislature of Nova Scotia\" or to \"Parliament\". In the contemplation of the questions, both the Provincial Legislature and Parliament, in purporting to exercise the delegated power, would be acting in the character of Legislature and Parliament respectively and as though each were exercising an additional head of jurisdiction written into section 91 or 92, rather than as mere groups of individuals. I therefore follow the course indicated by the Judicial Committee in the Lord's Day Alliance case (supra) where it is pointed out at page 389 that it is more than ordinarily expedient in the case of a reference such as this that the court should refrain from dealing with questions other than those which are in express terms referred to it. I would therefore dismiss the appeal.\nEstey J:.\u2014Bill No. 136 entitled \"An Act Respecting the Delegation of Jurisdiction from the Parliament of Canada to the Legislature of Nova Scotia and vice versa\" was introduced into the Legislature of the Province of Nova Scotia on August 26, 1947. After its first reading the bill was referred, under R.S. of N.S., 1923, c. 226, to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for an opinion as to its constitutional validity. The majority of the learned Judges, Mr. Justice Doull dissenting, expressed the opinion that it was beyond the jurisdiction of the Province to enact such legislation.\nThe Parliament of Canada and the Provincial Legislatures are created by and derive their respective legislative jurisdictions from the British North America Act. Within their respective legislative jurisdictions these legislative bodies possess complete legislative power. This includes the power to delegate legislative authority respectively to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor-in-Council and to subordinate bodies of their own creation. Hodge v. The Queen ([40]). In Re Gray ([41]). Fort Frances Pulp and Power Company v. Manitoba Free Press Company ([42]). Shannon v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board ([43]). Chemicals Reference, ([44]). In this reference it is submitted that the principle of delegation should be extended in order that the Parliament of Canada may delegate legislative power to the Provincial Legislatures and, in turn, that the Provincial Legislatures may delegate legislative power to the Parliament of Canada.\nIn Huth v. Clarke ([45]), Wills J. discusses delegation as between legislative bodies and, in part, states:\nDelegation, as the word is generally used, does not imply a parting with powers by the person who grants the delegation, but points rather to the conferring of an authority to do things which otherwise that person would have to do himself.\nThe fact that each of these legislative bodies\u2014the Parliament of Canada and the Provincial Legislatures\u2014as delegator would retain all of its legislative jurisdiction and might revoke the authority delegated does not detract from, nor militate against, the conclusion that, in so far as the legislative body as delegate purports to exercise the delegated authority, it is acting under a jurisdiction to legislate given to it by the delegator. The Parliament of Canada, in so far as it seeks to delegate to a Provincial Legislature authority to legislate, thereby purports to enlarge the legislative jurisdiction of that Legislature. The same is true when a Provincial Legislature seeks to delegate its authority to legislate to the Parliament of Canada. It is beyond the jurisdiction of these respective bodies to give legislative jurisdiction one to the other.\nThe Dominion cannot give jurisdiction, or leave jurisdiction, with the province. The provincial parliament cannot give legislative jurisdiction to the Dominion parliament. If they have it, either one or the other of them, they have it by virtue of the Act of 1867. I think we must get rid of the idea that either one or the other can enlarge the jurisdiction of the other or surrender jurisdiction.\u2014Lord Watson in Lefroy's Canada's Federal System, 1913 ed., p. 70 1 Note 10(a).\nMoreover, the provisions of the British North America Act contemplate these legislative bodies will, at all times, in the exercise of their sovereign jurisdiction, act as principals. There is no express provision nor is there any under which it could be reasonably implied that these bodies were intended to act as agents one for the other. Bill 136, in so far as it provides for the delegation of Provincial legislative powers or the reception of legislative powers from the Parliament of Canada, is beyond the jurisdiction of the Province to enact.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFauteux J.:\u2014The true question is whether or not it is within the competence of the Parliament of Canada and within the competence of the Legislature of a province to exchange between themselves or transfer to one another, directly or indirectly, temporarily and from time to time, a legislative authority they both possess only by virtue of the British North America Act, 1867 (here in after referred to as the Act) and which each, to the exclusion of the other, can exercise only with respect to certain classes of subjects.\nThe suggestion of delegation running through Bill 136, in reference to such transfer of legislative authority or the method therein devised to achieve such transfer does not, in my respectful view, go to the essence of the question involved. For, and it may be at once stated, the word \"delegate\" is not only an inadequate but a confusing designation of what the Bill purports to authorize. In the concept of delegation: the acceptation of the delegation is imperative and not permissive; the delegate does not make laws but by-laws, orders, rules or regulations; and such a subordinate legislation is, of its nature, ancillary to the statute which delegates the power to make it. As to the method to achieve the purpose of the Bill, it may be sufficient to say that in as much as it purports, in effect, to constitute Parliament a legislative agent of the Legislature of a province and the Legislature of a province the legislative agent of Parliament, it is incompatible with the normal operation of the Act.\nThe British North America Act, 1867 is the sole charter by which the rights claimed by the Dominion and the provinces respectively can be determined. No one has ever contended that a direct or indirect transfer of legislative authority\u2014whatever be the name used to designate such transfer\u2014is provided for in express terms under the Act, nor can it be implied without doing violence to the intent of the draftsman, to what is expressed in it and to the weight of judicial pronouncements available in the matter.\nWhat induced the Imperial Parliament to pass the Act must be found in the recitals in its preamble. Briefly, it is as therein indicated: the desire of the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to be federally united into one Dominion under the Crown; the expectation that such union would be conducive to the welfare of the provinces and to the promotion of the interests of the British Empire; the necessity to provide, on the establishment of the union, for the constitution of legislative authority and to declare the nature of executive government. This desire of the provinces to be united and the conditions upon which such union was agreed by them had been previously expressed in the Quebec and London Resolutions. In both it is stated that:\n* * * the system of government best adapted under existing circum stances to protect the diversified, interests of the several provinces and secure efficiency, harmony and permanency in the working of the union is a general government charged with matters of common interest to the whole country and local governments for each of the Canadas, and for the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, charged with the control of local matters in their respective sections * * *\nSpeaking to the point, Lord Atkin, in Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General for Ontario ([46]), said:\nNo one can doubt that this distribution (of powers) is one of the most essential conditions, probably the most essential condition, in the inter-provincial compact to which the British North America Act gives effect.\nIn the result, each of the provinces, enjoying up to the time of the union, within their respective areas, and quoad one another, an independent, exclusive and overall legislative authority, surrendered to and charged the Parliament of Canada with the responsibility and authority to make laws with respect to what was then considered as matters of common interest to the whole country and retained and undertook to be charged with the responsibility and authority to make laws with respect to local matters in their respective sections. This is the system of government by which the Fathers of Confederation intended\u2014and their intentions were implemented in the Act\u2014to \"protect the diversified interests of the several provinces and secure the efficiency, harmony and permanency in the working of the union.\nThe suggestion that this distribution of legislative authority, enacted by the Imperial Parliament, under the then \"existing circumstances\", could now be altered by Parliament or the Legislature of a province by transfer, exchange, or delegation, is repugnant to the very intent manifested in the above Resolutions ultimately implemented under the Act.\nIt is difficult to conceive that the provinces, so strongly desirous of retaining for themselves the legislative authority they then had with respect to local matters in order to continue, each of them, to attend to its own diversified interests, would have, at the same time, entertained the idea of giving to Parliament any kind of legislative authority\u2014subordinate or original\u2014with respect to such matters. Equally it is difficult to accept that the provinces, merging in Parliament so much of their legislative authority as was then considered necessary to properly attend to matters of common interest to the whole country, intended that such legislative authority should in turn be retransferred by Parliament, in part or temporarily, to the Legislature of one of the provinces, when it was so clearly intended that it should be shared and exercised at any and all times, in Parliament, by the people of all the provinces of the union, through a pre-determined pro portion of representatives for each of the provinces. I am unable to imagine that what Bill 136 purports to authorize was ever intended by the Imperial Parliament.\nTurning to what is expressed in the Act. It is convenient to say, at first, that the appellant did not suggest that the legislative authority of Parliament and of the Legislatures of the provinces respectively, can be transferred the one to the other, but contended it could be delegated the one to the other. What Bill 136 purports to authorize is not, for the reasons above indicated, a delegation within the ordinary meaning of the word but, in my views, a temporary and indirect transfer. Assuming, how- ever, that it could be a delegation, there can be no doubt that the express terms of sections 91 and 92 and the necessary implication flowing from the enactment of section 94 prohibits such delegation.\nWhile the two former sections provide for a distribution of legislative powers between Parliament and the Legislatures of the provinces, they go further and bar one from entering the legislative field assigned to the other. This distribution, and the prohibition which is a necessary corollary of it, constitute a peculiar feature of the Act with respect to the right of delegation and calls for different considerations in applying it. Each of these legislative bodies, equally sovereign within its own field, has the right to delegate its legislative authority to a subordinate body, for,\u2014as was done under the War Measures Act\u2014generally, the right to delegate is tacitly included in the right to legislate and, within one's own field, is not denied under the Act. Beyond their respective spheres, both Parliament and the Legislatures are powerless and each is specially denied the legislative powers given to the other. In these circumstances, I fail to see, firstly, how in the absence of express terms, one could assume the right to accept delegation and, secondly, how one could claim the right to make a delegation of powers to one which, in express terms, is barred from exercising them. Either one of these conclusions would justify the statement that such right to delegate is excluded under the Act, for delegation implies a delegator capable to delegate and a delegate capable to accept. Legislative jurisdiction cannot be assumed or be given by consent. Had it been the intention of the Imperial Parliament to give to one legislative body the right to delegate to the other, the word \"exclusively\" in both sections would have been omitted. In the context, this word is without object unless it is to debar one legislative body from exercising any kind of legislative authority with respect to matters within the jurisdiction of the other.\nSection 94 of the Act makes an exception to the rigidity of the rule related to the distribution of legislative powers and gives Parliament a relative power of legislation for uniformity of laws in three of the provinces of the union. It reads:\u2014\n94. Notwithstanding anything in this Act, the Parliament of Canada may make provision for the Uniformity of all or any of the Laws relative to Property and Civil Rights in Ontario, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, and of the procedure of all or any of the Courts in those Three Provinces, and from and after the passing of any Act in that Behalf the Power of the Parliament of Canada to make Laws in relation to any Matter comprised in any such Act shall, notwithstanding anything in this Act, be unrestricted; but any Act of the Parliament of Canada making Provision for such Uniformity shall not have effect in any Province unless and until it is adopted and enacted as Law by the Legislature thereof.\nThe presence of the above provisions in the Act clearly indicates that the right of one of the legislative bodies to delegate to the other, cannot be implied under the Act; otherwise, the section would be useless.\nThe complete review of the judicial pronouncements and their appreciation, made by Chief Justice Chisholm of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and the various comments made with respect to some of these pronouncements by other members of this Court, dispense with repetition and. establish that the weight of authority is against the views expounded on behalf of the appellant.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the Attorney General of Nova Scotia: J.

The trial judge queried the prudence of such an arrangement and being assured by her counsel, granted a decree nisi and endorsed on the record that on consent of the parties judgment was granted in the sum agreed upon. In the formal judgment the Court ordered payment of the sum as and for alimony and maintenance and the words \u201cor until this Court doth otherwise order\u201d were added. Subsequently the wife alleging, that the agreement as to the lump sum payment had been made without her consent and had been obtained by fraud on the part of her husband, brought an action in damages or in the alternative, for an order to set aside that part of the judgment and permit her to apply in the divorce action for an award of such alimony and maintenance as she should receive. This action (tried by Mackay J.) was dismissed, it being held that there was no fraud proven and that the wife had authorized acceptance. On appeal that decision was affirmed.\nBefore the judgment of Mackay J. was rendered a motion was made in the pending divorce suit to rescind or vary the Order as to maintenance and alimony and for an order directing the husband to secure to the wife such gross or annual sum of money, or in. addition thereto, or in substitution therefor, to pay such monthly or weekly sum as deemed reasonable by the Court and for an inquiry as to the respective assets of the parties. The trial of an issue having been ordered and an appeal from that Order taken, the Court of Appeal held that there was no jurisdiction in the Court to award a lump sum payment except by consent of the parties but that having been given, it had power to make the award but not to vary the amount thereafter.\nHeld: The real issue before Mackay J. was whether, notwithstanding the agreement under attack and the paragraph of the judgment which carried the effect of it into the judgment nisi, there still remained a right to claim maintenance upon the making of the final decree. That question having been conclusively determined against the plaintiff, she could not relitigate the matter. Green v. Weatherill [1929] 2 Ch. 213 at 221, 222. Hoystead v. Commissioner of Taxation [1926] A.C. 155 at 165.\nHeld: also, that the proposition that a judgment cannot take effect as res judicata or an estoppel unless it was given before the proceedings in which it is relied upon were commenced must be rejected. Law v. Hansen 25 Can. S.C.R. 69 at 76, applied.\nPer: Rand and Kellock JJ.:\u2014It is open to the parties to agree, as part of the adjudication of divorce, to waive the claim for alimony and maintenance in consideration of a lump sum allowance. The impugned provision in the order nisi constitutes evidence of the agreement and may be set aside only on grounds applicable to any agreement or judgment, or as defective as made without power or jurisdiction. If not set aside and not defective, it would be an answer to an application on the decree absolute for relief of either kind. Such an agreement is not within the ban pronounced in Hyman v. Hyman [1929] A.C. 601, and Mills v. Mills [1940], 2 All E.R. 254, would not apply because the final decree had not yet been pronounced. (Decision of the Court of Appeal [1950] O.R. 44 affirmed.)\nAPPEAL by special leave of the Court of Appeal for Ontario from the judgment of that court[1] allowing an appeal from the Order of Wells J. and dismissing the appellant\u2019s motion for an Order rescinding or varying the Order of Schroeder J.\nLewis Duncan K.C. and W.B. Williston for the appellant.\nGeorge Walsh K.C. and Margaret E. Perney K.C. for the respondent.\nC.R. Magone K.C. for the Attorney General of Ontario.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Taschereau, Estey, Locke and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal by special leave of the Court of Appeal for Ontario from the judgment of that Court of the 15th of December 19491, allowing an appeal from the Order of Wells J. of the 14th of April 1949 and dismissing the appellant\u2019s motion for an Order rescinding or varying paragraph 3 of the Order of Schroeder J. made in the action on the 21st of February 1946 and for other relief to be mentioned hereafter.\nThe appeal raises questions of general importance and, in order to understand what these questions are, it is necessary to give a short statement of the facts in chronological order. The appellant is the wife of the respondent, Cecil E. Maynard. By writ dated the 20th of December 1944 the appellant commenced the action in which the motion now in appeal was launched. The action was against the respondent and his co-defendant, Ruth Lillian Martin. The claim endorsed on the writ of summons was as follows:\nThe Plaintiff\u2019s claim is for the dissolution of the marriage between the Plaintiff and the Defendant Cecil E. Maynard. That the Plaintiff may be awarded such gross sum of money or annual sum of money as may be reasonable for her support, pursuant to the provisions of the statute in that behalf. Or in the alternative a declaration that the Plaintiff is entitled to alimony from the Defendant Cecil E. Maynard and also inter-alimony (sic.) and the costs to which she is entitled by the practice in that behalf and that for the purpose all necessary directions may be given and accounts taken.\nHer costs of the action, her interim disbursements.\nThe prayer for relief in the statement of claim is in the same terms as the endorsement on the writ with the addition of a prayer for such further and other relief as to the Court may seem meet.\nPrior to the commencement of this action the appellant and the respondent had separated and were living apart from each other pursuant to the terms of a separation agreement under which the respondent was liable to pay the appellant the sum of $15 a week. The payments under the separation agreement were kept up until the trial of the action. Up to that time the appellant was employed and no application for interim alimony was made prior to the trial.\nThe action came on for trial before Schroeder J. without a jury at Toronto on the 21st of February 1946. The appellant was represented by the late Mr. H.B. Proudlove, and the respondent was represented by Mr. C.E. Kitchen. The defendant Martin did not appear and was not represented. At the opening of the trial Mr. Kitchen informed the Court that he was appearing only with respect to alimony and that while the parties had been unable to agree on the question of alimony they had now, subject to His Lordship\u2019s approval, reached an agreement on that matter.\nFollowing the above statement the trial proceeded and it is obvious from the endorsement made on the record that Schroeder J. was satisfied that a case was made out entitling the plaintiff to judgment nisi. The evidence taken before Schroeder J. is not in the case which is before us, but the case contains a transcript of what passed between counsel and the learned judge at the end of the trial. This may be summarized as follows. Mr. Proudlove informed the Court that he and Mr. Kitchen had agreed that there should be judgment for $700 payable by the end of February 1946 and $500 payable on the 30th of September 1946. Schroeder J. asked whether this was in addition to the payments under the Separation Agreement mentioned above. Mr. Proudlove replied: \u201cNo. That completes the payment for alimony\u201d. Schroeder J. was obviously surprised at the proposal and questioned counsel in regard to it, suggesting that it was an imprudent arrangement for the Plaintiff to make. Both counsel having assured him that the agreement was made and understood, he finally said: \u201cYou have made your own agreement among yourselves anyway.\u201d To this, Mr. Proudlove replied: \u201cOh, yes; she is quite competent to, my Lord.\u201d Schroeder J. then had the terms repeated to him as to amounts and dates and said \u201cThat is for alimony and maintenance of the plaintiff and the infant child until he attains the age of 16?\u201d Mr. Proudlove replied in the affirmative and Schroeder J. then endorsed the record as follows:\nJudgment\n(a) for decree nisi dissolving the marriage between the plaintiff and the defendant spouse.\n(b) for custody of the infant to the plaintiff with reasonable right of access to the defendant spouse, provided that the infant is not permitted to visit the home of the defendant spouse whilst the defendants reside there in adulterous circumstances.\n(c) on consent of the parties, judgment in favour of plaintiff against defendant spouse for $500 payable September 30, 1946, and $700 payable February 28, 1946, as and for alimony and maintenance of the plaintiff and the infant until the latter attains the age of sixteen years.\n(d) costs of the action against the defendant, Maynard.\nFollowing this, a formal judgment was signed and entered. Paragraph 1 directs judgment nisi in the usual terms. Paragraph 2 deals with custody. Paragraph 4 deals with costs. Paragraph 3 reads as follows:\nAND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the defendant Cecil E. Maynard, do pay to the plaintiff the sum of seven hundred dollars on the twenty\u2011eighth day of February 1946, and the sum of Five hundred dollars on the thirtieth day of September 1946, as and for alimony and maintenance of herself, and for maintenance of the infant son of the plaintiff and the defendant Cecil E. Maynard, which infant son is Cecil Maurice Maynard, until the said infant attains the age of sixteen years of age; or until this Court doth otherwise order.\nThere is nothing in the record to show at whose instance or under what circumstances the final words \u201cor until this Court doth otherwise order\u201d were added to paragraph 3 of the formal judgment, but neither party has taken any steps seeking to have the formal judgment amended by the deletion of these words.\nShortly after the pronouncement of judgment nisi, Mr. Proudlove died suddenly, and for a time the appellant was without a solicitor. It appears that Mr. Kitchen had sent a cheque to Mr. Proudlove for the $700 payable on 28th February 1946 but that this cheque could not be found. The appellant got in touch with Mr. Kitchen who furnished her with a cheque for $700 which she deposited or cashed. Before the payment of the $500 payable on 30th September 1946 fell due, the appellant consulted her present solicitors. Mr. Duncan wrote to Mr. Kitchen asking that the $500 should not be forwarded. A cheque was, however, forwarded, but was not cashed.\nOn the 27th of November 1946 the appellant commenced a separate action in the Supreme Court of Ontario against the respondent. The statement of claim in that action alleges the marriage of the parties in 1918, the expulsion of the appellant from their matrimonial home and her desertion by the respondent in June of 1942, the entering into a Separation Agreement in the same month under which the respondent agreed to pay the plaintiff during her life and as long as she should remain chaste the sum of $15 each week and to convey certain property to her, the bringing of the action for divorce and the judgment rendered by Schroeder J., that the agreement embodied in paragraph 3 of that judgment was induced by fraudulent misrepresentations as to the respondent\u2019s financial position, that by reason of such misrepresentations no inquiry was made at the trial and no evidence given as to the financial position of the appellant or as to the ability of the respondent to pay alimony or maintenance or as to the conduct of the parties. There are also allegations of a successful plan to defraud the plaintiff in connection with the property which was conveyed to her pursuant to the Separation Agreement.\nThe Statement of Claim concludes with the following Prayer for relief:\nTHE PLAINTIFF THEREFORE CLAIMS by reason of the fact (sic.) hereinbefore pleaded, and in particular\u2014\n(1) by reason of the facts pleaded in paragraphs 1 to 10 inclusive hereof\u2014$25,000 damages;\n(2) In the alternative, by reason of the facts pleaded in paragraphs 1 to 10 inclusive hereof, an order setting aside paragraph 3 of the formal judgment bearing date the 21st day of February 1946, in the action in this Court of Maynard v. Maynard and Martin, and for an order setting aside paragraph (c) of the judgment in the said action as endorsed on the Record at the trial of the said action, and permitting the plaintiff to apply in the said action for an award of such alimony and maintenance as she should receive, having regard to her financial position and the ability of her husband, and the conduct of the parties;\n(3) by reason of the facts pleaded in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 11 hereof the sum of $600 being the total of 40 payments payable under the Separation Agreement bearing date the 9th day of June 1942, at $15 a week from the 26th day of February 1946 to the 27th day of November 1946, and $15 a week in the said Separation Agreement from the 27th day of November 1946, to Judgment, and interest on the said sums at 5 per cent until Judgment, or in the alternative for alimony by order of the Court;\n(4) by reason of the facts pleaded in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 and 11 hereof, interim alimony of $25 per week or such sum as the Court may determine until the trial of this action; and interim disbursements;\n(5) by reason of the facts pleaded in paragraphs 1 to 4 inclusive, and 13 and 14 hereof, $1,000 damages;\n(6) such further and other relief as the merits of the case may require;\n(7) her costs of this action.\nA lengthy statement of defence was delivered denying all the allegations of fraud, pleading that the settlement for $1,200 carried into paragraph 3 of the judgment of Schroeder J. was voluntarily made and fully understood and asking that the action be dismissed with costs.\nThe action came on for trial in due course before Mackay J. The trial occupied 14 days. Judgment was reserved and was given on the 7th of September 1948 dismissing the action without costs. In his reasons for judgment, Mackay J. found against the allegations of fraud and misrepresentation. The reasons state in part:\nI further find as a fact that the plaintiff authorized her solicitor, the late H. B. Proudlove, to accept a lump sum of $1,200 payable in amounts of $500 and $700 on specific dates, which lump sum was and was under- stood to be, by all parties, in full and final settlement of all claims for alimony and maintenance, such lump sum settlement to supersede and abrogate all payments under the separation agreement, Exhibit 1.\nI further find that the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor, the late H. B. Proudlove, acting for and on behalf of the plaintiff and with her knowledge, approval and consent, and in her presence informed the trial Judge, Schroeder J. in open Court, that the parties had agreed upon a lump sum settlement of $1,200, the terms of which he announced to the Court. I further find as a fact that the plaintiff fully understood the terms of the lump sum settlement as explained to the Court by her solicitor, and that she consented to it and that the judgment recorded on the record by the trial Judge referable to a lump sum payment for alimony and maintenance was with the full authority and consent of both parties.\nI further find that the parties, by themselves and through their solicitors were ad idem and that there was no mistake as to the question of a lump sum payment, i.e. $1,200 in full and complete settlement.\nThe appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario from the judgment of Mackay J., and on the 6th of December 1948 the appeal was dismissed without costs. No further appeal was taken in that action.\nIn the meantime, on the 17th of August 1948, before the judgment of Mackay J. was delivered, the Motion which forms the subject matter of this appeal was launched in the original divorce action. The relief sought and the grounds relied upon are set out in the notice of motion as follows:\n(a) for an Order rescinding or varying paragraph 3 of the Order of the Hon. Mr. Justice Schroeder of the 21st of February, 1946; and\n(b) for an Order directing the Defendant Cecil E. Maynard to secure to the plaintiff such gross or annual sum of money or in addition thereto or in substitution therefor to pay such monthly or weekly sum as may be deemed reasonable by this Honourable Court and for an inquiry as to respective assets and incomes of the plaintiff and of the defendant Cecil E. Maynard; and\n(c) for an Order restraining the defendant from alienating, encumbering or otherwise dealing with his property until the further order of this Honourable Court; and\n(d) in the alternative, for an Order determining what portion of the sum of $1,200, referred to in the said Order of the 21st day of February, 1946, is for alimony for the plaintiff; and what for maintenance for the infant; and what for maintenance for the wife after judgment absolute; and for an Order\n(e) granting to the plaintiff the sum of $25 per week for interim alimony pending the final judgment of this motion; and\n(f) such other relief as the merits on the case may require.\nUPON THE FOLLOWING GROUNDS:\n(1) That the said Order of 21st of February, 1946, is subject to the further order of the Court;\n(2) That the financial position of the plaintiff has altered since the making of the said Order; (3) That in so far as paragraph 3 of the said Order purports to award a lump sum for alimony and maintenance of the plaintiff and the infant, it was made without jurisdiction and contrary to the provisions of The Matrimonial Causes Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 208; alternatively, that it was made on the wrong principle and contrary to public policy;\n(4) That it is just and equitable that the said Order be rescinded or varied;\n(5) On such other grounds as may appear;\nWhen this motion first came before the Court it was adjourned until after Mackay J. should have given his judgment, and it was later further adjourned until the Court of Appeal should have given its judgment on the appeal from the judgment of Mackay J. After such appeal had been disposed of, the Motion finally came on to be heard before Wells J. in January 1949 and that learned judge gave judgment on the 14th of April 1949 directing the trial of an issue at the Toronto non-jury sittings, and enlarging the Motion before the judge presiding at the trial of the issue. The Order provided in part:\n1. THIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND DIRECT that Bertha Maynard and Cecil E. Maynard do proceed to the trial of an issue upon oral evidence before the Judge presiding at the Non-Jury Sittings of this Court and that the said Motion bearing date the 17th of August, 1948, be enlarged before the said Judge at the trial of the said issue, and that in the said issue, the said Bertha Maynard shall be the plaintiff and the said Cecil E. Maynard shall be the defendant.\n2. AND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER that the issue to be tried shall be whether there is power to rescind or vary paragraph 3 of the Order of The Honourable Mr. Justice Schroeder of the 21st of February, 1946, or to make any alteration in the provisions for alimony and maintenance provided by the said Order and if so what provision for alimony and maintenance should be made for the said Bertha Maynard.\nAn appeal was taken from this order and the Court of Appeal was of opinion that the motion raised a question of law which should have been determined by Wells J. before directing any issue, that the proper course under the circumstances would be to refer the matter back to Wells J. but that both counsel having asked the Court to dispose of the point of law this was a convenient course which should be followed. The question of law was stated to be whether or not the Court had power to vary paragraph 3 of the judgment of Schroeder J. in view of the fact that the same was a consensual judgment for a lump sum settlement in full of alimony and maintenance. The Court of Appeal decided that the question should be answered in the negative, allowed the appeal and ordered that the motion be dismissed, without costs.\nIn view of the findings of fact made by Mackay J., counsel for the appellant conceded before us that he must deal with the appeal on the basis that the agreement set out in paragraph 3 of the judgment of Schroeder J. had been entered into voluntarily by the appellant, that it was untainted with fraud and that the parties were ad idem. He contended however that even so the plaintiff was entitled to the relief claimed in the notice of motion heard by Wells J. In support of this contention the following points were argued with great force and ability:\n(i) that on a proper construction of the agreement embodied in paragraph 3 of the Order of Schroeder J., particularly having regard to the concluding words \u201cor until this Court doth otherwise order\u201d, the plaintiff is at liberty to apply to the Court for, and the Court has reserved to itself power to grant, further alimony and maintenance;\n(ii) that if paragraph 3 of the judgment of Schroeder J., properly construed, has the effect of declaring that, on payment by the respondent of the sums totalling $1,200 therein referred to, the appellant should never thereafter have any further right to claim for alimony or maintenance, then, if the matter is regarded as a judgment of the Court, Schroeder J. had no jurisdiction to pronounce it so as to effectively tie the hands of the Court in the future, and particularly on the granting of judgment absolute; and if, on the other hand, it is regarded as a judgment confirming an agreement between the parties, such agreement is unenforceable under the principles laid down in the decision of the House of Lords in Hyman v. Hyman[2].\n(iii) in support of the submission first mentioned in (ii) it is argued that the Judge pronouncing judgment nisi has no jurisdiction to deal with maintenance and that, even if this contention is rejected, it is clear that neither under the Imperial Statutes (1857), 20-21 Victoria c. 85 s. 32 and (1866) 29-30 Victoria c. 32 s. 1, nor under the Ontario legislation, R.S.O. 1937, c. 208 ss. 1 and 2 has the Court power to order payment to the wife out and out of a lump sum, that such jurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent and that if and insofar as the case of Mills v. Mills[3], appears to hold the contrary, it is distinguishable or ought not to be followed.\n(iv) in support of the submission last mentioned in (ii) it is argued that a contract otherwise invalid is not given validity merely by being incorporated in a consent judgment, citing Great West Central Railway v. Charlebois[4], and Huddersfield v. Lister[5].\n(v) that if it is sought to distinguish the case at bar from Hyman v. Hyman by reason of the difference between the wording of s. 32 of The Matrimonial Causes Act (1857) 20-21 Victoria (Imp.) c. 85, and that of s. 1 of the Matrimonial Causes Act, R.S.O. 1937 c. 208, then the latter section is ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature insofar as it is in conflict with the former, which, it is contended, became part of the law of Ontario by virtue of the Dominion Act, \u201cThe Divorce Act (Ontario)\u201d 1930, S. of C. c. 14. It should be pointed out that the important difference between the two sections is that the Imperial Act gives the Court jurisdiction to award maintenance (as distinguished from alimony) \u201con any such (i.e. final) decree\u201d, while the Ontario Act gives jurisdiction to make such award \u201cin any action for divorce\u201d.\n(vi) that giving effect to the above arguments the Court should declare that there remains in the Court in the pending divorce action power on the granting of decree absolute (or by order made prior to, but not to become effective until, the granting of such decree) to award the relief asked for in paragraph (b) of the notice of motion quoted above; and that the payment of the $1,200 made pursuant to paragraph 3 of the judgment of Schroeder J. (and which the appellant brought into Court in the action tried by Mackay J.) should be regarded only as one of the matters to be considered in fixing the quantum of maintenance to be ordered.\nTo all the above it was answered that the decision of the Court of Appeal was right upon the merits but that whether so or not the appellant is estopped by the judgment of Mackay J. If the respondent\u2019s contention as to estoppel is sound, it is sufficient to dispose of the appeal and I think that it should be first considered.\nThe main arguments against such estoppel were as follows: First, it was said that when the pleadings and the reasons for judgment of Mackay J. are examined it appears that that learned judge was not asked to deal and did not deal with the questions argued before us but only with the question whether the agreement between the parties embodied in paragraph 3 of the judgment of Schroeder J. should be set aside by reason of fraud or lack of consent; and that, while the appellant can no longer question the existence of the agreement on such grounds, it is still open to her to contend that, although existing as an agreement inter partes, it is no more effective to deprive the Court of its power to order maintenance as a condition of finally dissolving the marriage than was the agreement considered in Hyman v. Hyman (supra).\nSecondly\u2014although perhaps this is only putting the ground just stated in other words\u2014it is said that there is no identity of issue, and that the relief sought in the proceedings before us could not have been obtained in the action disposed of by Mackay J.\nThirdly, it is argued that even if otherwise an estoppel would have existed none can exist because the judgment of Mackay J. was not delivered until after the commencement of the present proceedings.\nIt was not questioned that the pleadings should be examined in order to ascertain what was in issue between the parties in the earlier proceedings and I think that the judgment of this Court in Hogg v. Toronto General Trusts Corporation[6], and that of the Court of Appeal in England in Marginson v. Blackburn Borough Council[7] make it clear that the reasons for judgment may also be considered.\nOn comparing clauses (a) and (b) in the notice of motion in the present proceedings with paragraph 2 of the statement of claim in the former action, it appears to me that, although not expressed in identical words, they ask for the very same relief. In the former action the appellant sought to set aside paragraph 3 of the judgment of Schroeder J. and, upon that having been done, to have it adjudged that she was entitled to apply in the divorce action for an award of such alimony and maintenance as, but for the existence of such paragraph, she would have been entitled to under the applicable legislation. Her claim was dismissed, the dismissal was affirmed by the Court of Appeal and that action is at an end. In the present proceeding the appellant again asks to \u201crescind or vary\u201d paragraph 3 of the Order of Schroeder J. and applies for an award of maintenance.\nIt is argued that the appellant is not estopped from seeking to vary or rescind paragraph 3 of the Order of Schroeder J. on the grounds that it was made without jurisdiction and is unauthorized by any valid legislation as these grounds were not put forward before, or considered by, Mackay J. It is further contended that, even if the appellant is estopped from seeking to vary or rescind such paragraph, it is nonetheless open to her to claim that, notwithstanding its existence, she is entitled to claim maintenance on the ground that the paragraph in question is ineffective in law to deprive the Court of power to award maintenance to her.\nPutting the matter in a different form, it was argued that all that has become res judicata by reason of the judgment of Mackay J. is the valid existence of an agreement inter partes in the terms set out in paragraph 3 of the judgment of Schroeder J. and that the appellant is not precluded, by having unsuccessfully questioned the valid existence of that agreement, from claiming any relief to which she may be by law entitled notwithstanding the agreement.\nI do not think that the arguments are entitled to prevail. I do not have to decide what the result would have been if in the action tried by Mackay J. the only claim made had been one to declare void the agreement embodied in paragraph 3 of the judgment of Schroeder J. Two other claims were expressly put forward in the pleadings, (a) for an order permitting the appellant to apply in the pending divorce action for an award of such alimony and maintenance as she should receive, and (b) for payment of the sums due under the separation agreement from the date of the trial before Schroeder J. to the date of judgment in the action tried by Mackay J. To decide whether these claims or either of them should be allowed, it was \u2018 necessary for Mackay J. to pass not merely upon the continued existence of the agreement carried into paragraph 3 of the judgment of Schroeder J. but also upon its construction and effect including the effect if any to be given to the concluding words of that paragraph \u201cor until this Court doth otherwise order\u201d. It may be that counsel assumed that unless and until paragraph 3 of the judgment of Schroeder J. was set aside it constituted an insuperable barrier to any further claim for maintenance in the divorce proceedings and that consequently the view, so fully and ably argued before us, that notwithstanding such paragraph the Court has power to grant maintenance, was not put before Mackay J. at all. It may be that such an assumption, if it were made, was erroneous; as to that I express no opinion. It may be that some of the points of law argued before us were not thought of at that time. All this however would, it seems to me, be nihil ad rem. The issue now before us was, I think, expressly raised in the pleadings in the earlier proceeding and was decided by the judgment of Mackay J., dismissing that action. The appellant has submitted the same question as is now before us (although perhaps not the same arguments) to the decision of a Court of competent jurisdiction and cannot now re-litigate the matter.\nThe following passage from the judgment of Maugham J., as he then was, in Green v. Weatherill[8], seems to me to state concisely the principles which are applicable:\nthe plea of res judicata is not a technical doctrine, but a fundamental doctrine based on the view that there must be an end to litigation: see In re May[9]; Badar Bee v. Habib Merican Noordin[10]. In the latter case it may be observed that Lord Macnaghten in delivering the judgment cites from the Digest and relies on the maxim \u201cExceptio rei judicatae obstat quotiens eadem quaestio inter easdem personas revocatur.\u201d In the leading case of Henderson v. Henderson[11], there is to be found the following statement of the law by Wigram V.C.: \u201cI believe I state the rule of the Court correctly when I say that where a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in and of adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Court requires the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case and will not (except under special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought forward only because they have from negligence, inadvertence or even accident, omitted part of their case. The plea of res judicata applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the Court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time.\u201d This passage has recently been approved by the Privy Council in the case of Hoystead v. Commissioner of Taxation[12].\nIn the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Hoystead v. Commissioner of Taxation12, at page 165 is the following:\nParties are not permitted to begin fresh litigations because of new views they may entertain of the law of the case, or new versions which they present as to what should be a proper apprehension by the Court of the legal result either of the construction of the documents or the weight of certain circumstances.\nIf this were permitted litigation would have no end, except when legal ingenuity is exhausted. It is a principle of law that this cannot be permitted, and there is abundant authority reiterating that principle.\nIn my opinion the law is correctly stated in Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England (2nd Edition) Volume 13 at page 410, where it is said that the principle of estoppel applies \u201cwhether the point involved in the earlier decision, and as to which the parties are estopped is one of fact, or one of law, or one of mixed law and fact\u201d.\nIt remains to consider the third argument of the appellant mentioned above. This is founded on a passage in Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England 2nd Edition Volume 13 at page 449:\nIt seems that a judgment cannot take effect as a res judicata, or an estoppel unless it was given before the proceedings in which it is relied upon were commenced.\nIt is said that the date of the commencement of the proceedings now before us was 17th August 1948, the date of the notice of motion which eventually came before Wells J., and the judgment of Mackay J. was not pronounced until 7th September 1948.\nThree cases are referred to in the footnote to the statement from Halsfoury quoted above: Houston v. Marquis of Sligo[13]; The Delta\u2014The Erminia Foscolo[14]; and Re Defries; Norton v. Levy[15]. Support for the statement quoted from Halsbury is contained in The Delta. The judgment was founded also on other grounds, but no doubt Sir Robert Phillimore gave as the principal reason for his decision the fact that the judgment which it was alleged created an estoppel had not been given until after the action before him was commenced.\nIn Houston v. Sligo Pearson J. expressed a doubt as to this ground of decision in The Delta and held against the existence of an estoppel on other grounds. On appeal from his judgment the point with which we are concerned was not dealt with, as a consent order was pronounced. The effect of the decision of Pollock B. in re Defries is directly contrary to the statement quoted from Halsbury. The action before Pollock B. was commenced on 5th March 1881 and at the trial on 2nd May 1883 that learned judge, after hearing argument on the point, gave effect to an estoppel created by a judgment delivered on 24th July 1882.\nI do not think that I have to choose between these apparently conflicting decisions, as the point appears to me to be settled so far as this Court is concerned by the judgment in Law v. Hansen[16]. In that case the ground of decision in The Delta with which we are concerned was carefully considered and the reasoning upon which it was founded was, I think, rejected. At page 76 King J. giving the judgment of the Court said:\nNo substantial objection therefore can be said to lie against the bringing forward of a defence based upon a judgment recovered after action brought.\nAt page 75 the same learned judge put the question:\nWhy should a plaintiff in a foreign action, by commencing fresh proceedings in another country on the eve of judgment rendered, become entitled to litigate the matter anew?\nIn that case the judgment held to create an estoppel in the Courts of Nova Scotia was that of a foreign tribunal. It seems to me that the decision would apply a fortiori where the second proceeding is started in the very Court in which the issue is already standing for judgment.\nSo that it may not appear to have been overlooked, I should mention another argument put forward on behalf of the appellant. It was submitted that, if the argument that paragraph 3 of the judgment of Schroeder J. was made without jurisdiction is sound, then the appellant, as a matter of law, could not be estopped from asserting such lack of jurisdiction; in other words, that jurisdiction can not be acquired by means of estoppel any more than by means of consent. For the sake of argument the last stated proposition may be accepted. It is stated in Spencer Bower on Estoppel by Representation (1923) at page 187 as follows:\nEven the most plain and express contract or consent, a fortiori, therefore, any mere conduct or inaction or acquiescence, of a party litigant from which a representation may be implied such as to give rise to an estoppel, cannot confer judicial authority on any of His Majesty\u2019s subjects not already invested with such authority by the law of the land, or add to the jurisdiction lawfully exercised by any judicial tribunal.\nThis rule is, I think, concerned with cases of estoppel by representation and not with cases of res judicata or estoppel by record. Had the appellant in the action tried by Mackay J. expressly raised for decision the point that paragraph 3 of the judgment of Schroeder J. was invalid on the ground that it was made without jurisdiction and had that point been finally decided adversely to her it could not have been raised again in litigation between the same parties. In my view, while not raised expressly in the pleadings, the question of the validity of the order of Schroeder J. was fundamental to the decision of Mackay J. and the reason that I think the question is not now open for our consideration is not that the appellant is precluded by her consent or conduct or acquiescence in the proceedings before Schroeder J., but because Mackay J. whose judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal has decided the point against her.\nIn my view, the real issue before Mackay J. both in form and in substance was whether, notwithstanding all that had happened, including the making of the agreement under attack and the paragraph of the judgment of Schroeder J. which carried the effect of that agreement into the judgment nisi, there still remained in the appellant a right to claim maintenance upon the making of a final decree of dissolution. I think that question has been con- clusively determined against the appellant and I do not think that she can ask the Court to pass upon it again merely because she now puts forward an argument. in support of her contention that paragraph 3 of the judgment of Schroeder J. should be disregarded, which was not put forward in the action before Mackay J. I do not think it is necessary to enquire whether the arguments addressed to us as to the lack of jurisdiction of Schroeder J. were addressed either to Mackay J. or to the Court of Appeal on appeal from his judgment. I think that, applying the principles laid down in Hoystead v. Commissioner of Taxation, cited above, it was a ground which the appellant, if she wished to rely upon it, was bound to bring forward at that time.\nOne further matter should be mentioned. It is clear that in order for the judgment of Mackay J. to constitute an effective estoppel that learned judge must have had jurisdiction to pronounce it. I did not understand counsel for the appellant to question the jurisdiction of Mackay J. in the action before him to decide the question mentioned above as to whether there remained in the appellant a right to claim maintenance. His argument, as I understand it, was that Mackay J. did not decide the question. It might, however, be suggested that if the appellant\u2019s argument, that the question of maintenance (as distinguished from alimony) can be dealt with only on the pronouncing of decree absolute or by order made in contemplation of and only to become effective upon the granting of judgment absolute, is right, then Mackay J. had no more jurisdiction to deprive the appellant of her right to maintenance than did Schroeder J. I think that this difficulty is apparent rather than real. Mackay J. was not asked to award maintenance to the appellant. Schroeder J. was asked to award it and purported to do so. Mackay J. was asked not to fix maintenance but to say by his order that the plaintiff was still entitled to claim it in the action. In my view he had jurisdiction to decide this question in an action brought for the purpose of determining it; although it might be suggested that a more appropriate procedure would have been to move for judgment absolute and to make the claim for maintenance on such motion. I am of opinion that this appeal fails on the ground that the appellant is estopped by the judgment of Mackay J. from asserting the claim now put forward. Having reached this conclusion, I do not think it desirable to express any opinion on the other questions argued before us. While I respectfully agree with the learned Justices of Appeal who granted leave to appeal that those questions are of great and general importance, it seems to me that once it has been decided that effect must be given to Mr. Walsh\u2019s argument based on estoppel any further discussion would be obiter.\nUnder all the circumstances, I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed without costs. The appellant\u2019s motion to enlarge the case by including therein further material should also be dismissed without costs.\nThe judgment of Rand and Kellock JJ. was delivered by:\nRAND J.:\u2014Accepting Mr. Duncan\u2019s contention that the law of England in relation to alimony and maintenance applies in Ontario by force of The Divorce Act (Ont.) (1930) S. of C. c. 14, the question reduces itself to this: can a petitioner for divorce, claiming alimony and maintenance, bind herself by an agreement with the respondent at the trial by which, in satisfaction of all rights to alimony, past or future, and to future maintenance, a lump sum is to be paid and accepted, for the payment of which, what purports to be an order, by consent, is included in the decree nisi?\nThe English law is to be found in 20-21 Vict., c. 85, s. 32 and 29-30 Vict., c. 32, s. 1, and its effect is that the Court has jurisdiction on a decree of divorce to order the husband to secure to the wife such gross or annual sum of money as, having regard to certain matters specified, the Court deems reasonable; or to make an order for weekly or monthly sums for maintenance during their joint lives. It is settled that the Court has no power under these provisions to order payment of a lump sum; the latter can only be \u201csecured\u201d. As stated by Lord Greene in Mills v. Mills[17], \u201csuch payment can only be consensual.\u201d Two authorities bear upon the question raised. In Mills v. Mills, supra, it was held by the Court of Appeal that after an order for maintenance had been made, the parties could agree upon a lump sum in satisfaction of all rights under it and embody the agreement in a subsequent order which at the same time discharged the original order and petition; and in Hyman v. Hyman[18], the House of Lords held a provision in a separation agreement that the wife would never assert a claim to maintenance was not a bar to an application following a decree absolute, on the ground that there was a public interest in the duty of the husband to support the wife which would be affected by the divorce, and which could not by such an agreement be defeated.\nIs, then, an agreement entered into at the hearing and incorporated in the decree nisi within the ban pronounced in Hyman v. Hyman or is it open to the parties to agree, as part of the adjudication of divorce, to waive the claim for alimony and maintenance in consideration of a lump sum allowance? I do not see that the time of repudiation of such an agreement would affect the matter even though in Mills v. Mills the application in effect to revive the original order for maintenance was made seven years after the order approving the commutation had issued and was clearly not made \u201con a decree\u201d: that point could not be raised here because the final decree has not yet been granted. So made, the impugned provision in the order nisi, constituting the evidence of the agreement and evidencing the abandonment of the claim for alimony and maintenance, is, in my opinion, either definitive, to be set aside only on grounds applicable to any agreement or judgment, or fatally defective as made without power or jurisdiction; and if not set aside and not defective, it would be an answer to an application on the decree absolute for relief of either kind.\nMust the Court, as a condition of validity in any adjudication involving the right to alimony and maintenance insist on examining all matters relating to these claims and formally adjudging a gross or annual sum to be secured or periodic payments to be made notwithstanding that the parties do not desire it? I see nothing in the policy under- lying Mills v. Mills to require that to be done, particularly as by the rule laid down, as I interpret it, they could the next day bring their agreement into Court and have the order discharged. There would, no doubt, have been placed before the petitioner the amount which the Court considered proper and further time would be gained; but are these sufficient considerations on which to ground such an exceptional requirement? If the Court is not to insist upon the enquiry, will the right of the wife be lost if she refuses, at that time, to assert it? If not, there would result an unprecedented indulgence to her as a litigant which I should say is unwarranted.\nThe chief and controlling interest is her interest. The legislature has not provided for the representation of the public on the hearing of a divorce action; and to impose an absolute duty upon the Court to proceed upon its own independent enquiry and adjudication in disregard of the desire of the parties would seem to me to be an extravagance in paternalism and a burden on the Court quite beyond the scope of the statute. A refusal to allow a provision in a separation agreement to defeat a jurisdiction founded in part on public policy, is based on considerations very different from those that would permit a party to a suit to repudiate a consensus openly announced in court and made part of the relief adjudged; and such a judgment can be taken to be a nullity only if there has been a failure in a duty placed on the Court itself. If the public interest were of such high concern, we could properly expect to find provision made in the legislation for its assertion by a representative of the public and not by the Court.\nThe clause in the order nisi, \u201cor until this Court doth otherwise order\u201d, cannot preserve a jurisdiction which by the judgment has been exhausted; and the observations of the Master of the Rolls in Mills v. Mills, (supra) on similar language in the order in that case are directly pertinent here. The clause adds nothing to the decree and is unavailing to the support of the appeal.\nThe circumstances here give some colour to what I think is the reality behind the efforts that have been made to set aside the judgment now attacked. It may be that the petitioner was badly advised, or that she herself exercised poor judgment, in agreeing to accept the particular sum. But that occasional hardship cannot justify a departure from rules governing the course of courts which are necessary to their proper functioning; and where parties act freely, with full opportunity to ascertain all relevant facts, they must abide by that adjudication of their private quarrel to which they gave their consent.\nThe appeal, therefore, must be dismissed, but without costs. The motion made at the hearing should likewise be dismissed.\nThe appeal and the motion to enlarge the case by including therein further material are both dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Duncan & Bicknell.\nSolicitor for the (Defendant) Maynard, respondent: Margaret E.

Default having been made on bonds secured by a mortgage or trust deed, a meeting of the bondholders was held to consider a plan submitted on behalf of the mortgagors which provided for the sale of the equity of redemption to a company to be formed, payment to the bondholders of the full amount of their capital investment but not of the interest in default, and preservation of an equity to the mortgagors. The majority of the bondholders having voted approval an order was obtained from the Court under the provisions of s. 15(i) of The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 100, approving the terms of the proposed sale. The decision of the Court of Appeal reversing the Order was appealed to this Court.\nHeld: That the appeal should be dismissed.\nHeld: also by the majority of the Court that:\n(1) The proposed arrangement was in substance a sale for a consideration other than cash within the terms of s. 15(i) and the judge of first instance was right in entering upon the merits of the proposal but the section does not enable the Court to sanction a sale on terms which will yield the mortgagor a substantial part of the sale price while yielding the mortgagee only a portion of the mortgage debt and having regard to the value of the property the terms of the sale could not be held to be fair and reasonable within the meaning of the Act.\n(2) The majority bondholder in voting in favour of the plan was influenced by motives of benevolence and a regard for the moral claims of the mortgagors rather than by a consideration of the interests of the bondholders as a class and therefore the resolution approving the plan could not stand. British American Nickel Corp. v. O\u2019Brien [1927] A.C. 369; Ex Parte Cowen. In re Cowen L.R. 2 Ch.

The judgment of Taschereau and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.: This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[3] setting aside an order of Urquhart J.[4], made under section 15 (i) of The Judicature Act of Ontario, ordering and approving the sale of an apartment house property in the City of Kingston to Hanson Apartments Limited.\nThe appellants are the owners of the equity of redemption in the property in question. In 1929 when the apartment house was in course of construction, the appellants arranged with United Bond Company Limited to underwrite a bond issue of $135,000 6 \u00bd per cent first mortgage bonds, secured by a mortgage and trust deed dated 20th June 1929 made by the appellants as mortgagors to The London and Western Trusts Company Limited and Howard C. Wade as mortgagees. The plaintiffs are successors to these trustees. The trust deed is not in the material before us but we were informed by counsel that it is made pursuant to the Short Forms of Mortgages Act, contains the mortgagors\u2019 covenant to pay, creates a fixed and specific charge in favour of the trustees and contains an express power of sale, in the usual short form, on one month\u2019s default and one month\u2019s notice. It contains no provision for the holding of meetings of bondholders and no provision enabling a majority of the bondholders to sanction a sale, transfer or exchange of the mortgaged premises for a consideration other than cash. Unfortunately, United Bond Company Limited went into receivership with the result that the appellants although liable to pay bonds totalling $135,000 actually received only $86,700, an amount insufficient to complete the building. They succeeded in completing the building by using their own resources and by obtaining a loan of $60,000 from the Ontario Equitable Life Insurance Company secured by a first mortgage on the property, to which the bond mortgage was postponed by order of the Supreme Court of Ontario dated 27th January 1931. As collateral security to this $60,000 mortgage, life insurance policies totalling $100,000 were taken and assigned to the Ontario Equitable Life Insurance Company. It was stipulated that default in payment of the life insurance premiums would be regarded as default under the mortgage. The first two interest coupons on the bonds were duly paid on 20th December 1929 and 20th June 1930, respectively, but no further interest was paid until 1943. Since June 1943 substantial payments on account of interest have been made to the bondholders. On 12th November 1930 an action was commenced in the Supreme Court of Ontario by the then trustees under the bond mortgage against the defendants to enforce the security. That action is still pending and the order of Urquhart J. is styled in that action and \u201cIn the matter of section 15 (i) of The Judicature Act R.S.O. 1937 c. 100\u201d.\nSince 18th December 1930 the respondent, The Canada Trust Company, and its predecessor, have been in possession of the mortgaged premises as receiver.\nIn or about the year 1933 the appellants bought in bonds of the face value of $63,900 and surrendered them to the trustees. In 1939 an unsuccessful effort to re-finance and end the receivership was made.\nIn 1949 the appellants put forward the plan which was approved by Urquhart J. The plan is signed by the appellants under date of 7th March 1949 and the following statement is appended to it duly sealed by Hanson Apartments Limited and signed by its proper officers:\nHANSON APARTMENTS LIMITED hereby authorizes and approves the offer and plan contained in the within letter and undertakes and agrees to effectually complete the same forthwith upon approval being given in accordance with the provisions of The Judicature Act.\nWITNESS the seal of the Company under the hands of its proper officers at Kingston, this 12th day of May, A.D. 1949.\nOn 30th May 1949 Barlow J. made an order upon motion of the appellants and the trustees, and with the consent of The Canada Trust Company in its capacity as receiver, directing The Canada Trust Company to summon a meeting of the bondholders on 20th June 1949\nfor the purpose of considering, and if thought fit approving and sanctioning with or without modification or amendment, FIRST, a certain plan proposed by the defendants, Mathew Hanson and Tekla Hanson dated the 7th day of March, 1949, being Exhibit \u201cA\u201d to the said affidavit of Mathew Hanson and Tekla Hanson filed, providing for the sale, transfer or exchange of the said property and assets for a consideration wholly or in part other than cash, all as therein set out; SECONDLY, in default of approval of the said plan either as proposed by the defendants Mathew Hanson and Tekla Hanson or as modified or amended, any other plan that may be proposed at the said meeting or at any adjournment thereof for the sale, transfer or exchange of the said property and assets for a consideration wholly or in part other than cash; and for the purpose of transacting such other business as may be incidental, consequential or supplemental thereto;\nThe order contained directions as to procedure at the meeting, and provided that upon the termination of the. meeting or any adjournment thereof the minutes should be filed with the Court and that the Canada Trust Company might apply for further directions.\nAt the date of the offer the property in question was encumbered as follows:\nOntario Equitable Life Mortgage..................................................................\n$57,500.00\nBonds outstanding\u2014principal.......................................................................\n71,100.00\nInterest owing on bonds.................................................................................\n93,082.52\nThe life insurance policies held as collateral security by the Ontario Equitable had a cash surrender value of $26,825.\nHanson Apartments Limited was incorporated under the Ontario Companies Act with an authorized capital of fifteen hundred 4 per cent non-cumulative preference shares of the par value of $50 each and twelve hundred common shares without par value. The plan was stated to contemplate:\n(1) The purchase by the above company of the equity of Mathew and Tekla Hanson in the New Annandale property together with any and all rights, interest, choses in action, claims and demands they may have against the Trustees under the Trust deed, the Receiver and Manager, The Equitable Life Insurance Company of Canada, any bondholder, bondholders, or other person, persons or corporations arising out of the ownership and financing of the New Annandale Building, to be paid for by the allotment to the said Mathew and Tekla Hanson, or their nominees, of the 1,200 common shares.\n(2) A loan by Hanson Apartments Limited in an amount sufficient for the purposes later enumerated secured by\n(a) a first mortgage on the New Annandale property, and\n(b) an assignment to the mortgagee of the four Equitable Life Insurance Company policies having recently a cash surrender value of $26,825.\n(3) Retirement of the $71,100 in bonds and a discharge of the trust mortgage by giving to the bondholders the option of,\n(a) preference shares in an amount equal to the face value of bonds held or,\n(b) cash for the face value of the bonds held.\n(4) The proceeds of the first mortgage loan to be used,\n(a) to pay off the present Equitable Life Mortgage now amounting to $57,500; (b) to pay those bondholders who elect to take cash, or part cash, for their second mortgage bonds; to set up a reserve for missing bonds; and to provide for disbursements incidental to carrying out the plan of re-financing.\nThe meeting was duly held. Of the $71,100 bonds outstanding $66,950 were represented Bonds totalling $35,650 were voted in favour of the plan and $31,300 against it. All of the bonds voted in favour of the plan were owned by the respondent J.M. Hickey. Those voted against it were owned in varying amounts by one corporation and nine individuals. Following the meeting the appellants moved before Urquhart J. for an order approving the sale. The trustees took a neutral position. The minority bondholders opposed the motion.\nThe material before Urquhart J. disclosed the facts set out above and also the opinion of three valuators as to the value of the mortgaged premises. The valuations varied from a low of $165,000 to a high of \u201c$250,000 if not a forced sale or $225,000 if the property were sold at a forced sale\u201d. Mr. Colin Drever, an architect practising his profession in Kingston, in an affidavit filed on behalf of the appellants, placed the value at $175,000.\nUrquhart J. granted the motion. The formal order of the Court ordered and approved \u201cthe sale to Hanson Apartments Limited\u201d of the mortgaged premises \u201cfor the consideration and upon the terms of the offer of Hanson Apartments Limited set out in the plan submitted by the defendants Mathew Hanson and Tekla Hanson dated the 7th day of March 1949, a copy of which appears as Schedule \u201cA\u201d to this order and is declared to be a part hereof\u201d. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the order provided:\nAND THIS COURT DOTH DECLARE that such sale for the consideration and upon the terms aforesaid is fair and reasonable having regard to the interests of all parties interested in the premises and property so mortgaged or charged by the aforesaid Mortgage and Deed of Trust AND DOTH ORDER THE SAME ACCORDINGLY.\nAND THIS COURT DOTH FURTHER ORDER that leave be reserved to the parties hereto to apply for a further and subsequent Order or Orders making provision in such manner on such terms in all respects as to this Court may seem proper for the transfer to and the vesting in the purchaser or its assigns of the whole of the right, title and interest of the Plaintiffs in their capacities aforesaid and of the plaintiff The Canada Trust Company as Receiver and Manager, in the said property, assets and undertaking of the Defendants, and for the transfer to and vesting in the purchaser or its assigns of the whole of the right, title and interest of the Defendants in the said property, and for the distribution or other disposition of the proceeds of such sale, and for the protection of any or all persons whose interests are affected by such Order, and for all such incidental, supplemental and consequential matters as the Court may deem just.\nThe Court of Appeal, in allowing the appeal, dealt with only one ground which is stated in the reasons as follows:\nNor do I think it necessary to consider the merits of the scheme of re-financing proposed to be completed if the order of approval of Urquhart J. stands. Suffice it to say that the sale in question is one arranged solely by the defendants (the mortgagors) and is to a Company organized by the defendants and in which they would hold all or the greater part of the stock.\nIn my opinion, it is beyond question that the proposed sale is not a sale under the power of sale in the mortgage or trust deed.\nThe sole question, therefore, for determination on this appeal is: Is the jurisdiction conferred on the Court by sec. 15 (i) of The Judicature Act, confined to the sanctioning of sales for other than cash only in proceedings to realize under a power of sale contained in a trust deed or mortgage securing bonds or debentures?\nIn my opinion a reading of the terms of sec. 15 (i) requires an affirmative answer to such question. To paraphrase the provisions of that section, it will be noted that \u201cthe Court may in such action order and approve such sale\u201d. Now what is \u201csuch sale\u201d? Is it \u201cthe\u201d sale which has been sanctioned and approved by the holders of such bonds and debentures and is \u201cthe\u201d sale which is \u201cfor a consideration wholly or in part other than cash\u201d? Referring further to the words of the section, what is \u201cthe\u201d sale which bondholders may sanction and approve? Is it \u201cthe\u201d sale which may arise where \u201cany action shall have been brought or shall be brought for the purpose of enforcing or realizing upon any such mortgage or charge\u201d, i.e. upon a mortgage or charge securing bonds or debentures? This can only be a sale by the mortgagee in realizing upon the security and in my opinion cannot refer to a sale by a mortgagor attempting to salvage his equity of redemption. There is no pretence that the sale in question in this matter is one under the power of sale provision of the trust deed.\nIn the section prior to the 1935 amendment which was then repealed and had substituted therefor the present section 15 (i), it is more abundantly evident that the power of the Court to approve was only in an action brought by the mortgagee or trustee to realize upon the mortgage security by a sale for a consideration other than cash.\n* * *\nThe present scheme which the Court has been asked to approve is in effect a compromise or adjustment put forward by the debtors to arrange and re-adjust their liabilities with their various creditors. Failing the unanimous consent of all creditors it is not a matter for the Court\u2019s approval.\nOn the foregoing ground alone, which goes to the very root of the order appealed from, the appeal must succeed.\nWith the greatest respect to the learned Justices of Appeal, if I had reached the conclusion that the order of Urquhart J. should be upheld upon the merits I would hesitate to give effect to the objection to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction upon which the judgment of the Court of Appeal is based.\nThe conditions necessary to give jurisdiction to the Court to approve a sale under section 15 (i) of The Judicature Act, so far as they are relevant to the case at bar, appear to me to be as follows:\n(a) the existence of bonds secured by a mortgage;\n(b) an action shall have been brought for the purpose of enforcing such mortgage;\n(c) both of the above conditions being fulfilled the Court shall have ordered a meeting of the bondholders to be summoned;\n(d) the holders of the bonds by a vote at such meeting of not less than fifty per cent in principal amount of the total bonds outstanding shall have sanctioned the sale, transfer or exchange of the property mortgaged for a consideration wholly or in part other than cash.\nIf all the above conditions are fulfilled the Court has, I think, jurisdiction to approve of the sale so sanctioned. Nothing is contained in the section to guide the Court as to how that jurisdiction shall be exercised except the provision that if the sale is approved it must be \u201con such terms in all respects as the Court shall think fair and reasonable having regard to the interests of all parties interested in the premises and property so mortgaged\u201d.\nIt is clear that, in this case, conditions (a), (b) and (c) mentioned above have been fulfilled. Whether or not condition (d) has been fulfilled depends upon whether the arrangement which is contained in the order of Urquhart J. can properly be described as a sale of the mortgaged premises for a consideration wholly or in part other than cash.\nSuch arrangement is clearly not a sale under the power of sale contained in the mortgage. It could not be, because the mortgage contains no power to sell for a consideration other than cash. But one of the purposes of the section appears to be to enable such sales to be made under mortgages containing no such power.\nI agree with Mr. Wilson\u2019s submission that the validity of the sale is not to be tested by the origin of the proposal, but to enable it to derive validity from section 15 (i) it must be a sale of the mortgaged premises. Had the order of Urquhart J. been carried out the result would have been that Hanson Apartments Limited would have become the owner of the mortgaged premises, subject only to the first mortgage to the Ontario Equitable Life. All title previously held by the trustees or by the appellants would have been vested in Hanson Apartment Limited. The consideration passing from it would have been 1,200 fully paid shares of its common stock and $71,100 paid in cash or by the allotment and issue of fully paid preference shares or partly in cash and partly by the issue of such shares. This seems to me to be in substance a sale of the mortgaged premises for a consideration wholly or in part other than cash. There is one marked dissimilarity between the proposed arrangement and an ordinary sale by a mortgagee. In the latter case the whole consideration would be paid to the mortgagee and the owners of the equity would receive only the surplus, if any, remaining after the mortgage debt was fully satisfied, while under the proposed arrangement a definite portion of the consideration is to pass to the owners of the equity. I do not think that this goes to jurisdiction. The section is not designed to cover ordinary sales by mortgagees but rather special cases where the circumstances are such as to move the Court to approve a sale for a consideration other than cash even though no power to make such a sale is contained in the mortgage. The fact that the consideration is other than cash renders it necessary for the Court to consider how such consideration should be apportioned between the mortgagee and the mortgagor. The fact that the parties tentatively make this apportionment in the proposal does not, I think, take the case out of section 15 (i) so as to deprive the Court of jurisdiction; although unreasonableness in the proposed apportionment would move the Court to refuse its approval.\nIn my view the proposed arrangement may properly be regarded as being, in substance, a sale of the mortgaged premises to Hanson Apartments Limited for a consideration wholly or in part other than cash within the terms of section 15 (i) of The Judicature Act and Urquhart J. was right in entering upon a consideration of the merits of the proposal; but, with the greatest respect, I differ from the conclusion which he reached. Before dealing with the details of the proposed arrangement I think it desirable to consider the interpretation of section 15 (i). That section reads as follows:\n(i) (i) In case bonds or debentures are secured by a mortgage or charge by virtue of a trust deed or other instrument and whether or not provision is contained in the trust deed or other instrument creating such mortgage or charge giving to the holders of such bonds or debentures or a majority, or a specified majority of them, power to sanction the sale, transfer or exchange of the mortgaged or charged premises for a consideration other than cash, and in case any action shall have been brought or shall be brought for the purpose of enforcing or realizing upon any such mortgage or charge, or for the execution of the trusts in any such trust deed or other instrument with or without other relief, the court may order a meeting or meetings of the holders of such bonds or debentures to be summoned and held in such manner as the court may direct, and if the holders of such bonds or debentures shall sanction or approve the sale, transfer or exchange of the property so mortgaged or charged for a consideration wholly or in part other than cash, the court may in such action order and approve such sale on such terms in all respects as the court shall think fair and reasonable having regard to the interests of all parties interested in the premises and property so mortgaged or charged, and in such order or by any subsequent order may make provision in such manner, on such terms in all respects as to the court may seem proper, for the transfer to and vesting in the purchaser or his or its assigns of the whole or any part of the premises and property so mortgaged or charged and so sold, and for the payment of the proper costs, charges and expenses and remuneration of any trustee or trustees under such trust deed or other instrument and of any receiver or receiver and manager appointed by the court, and of any committee or other persons representing holders of such bonds or debentures, and for the distribution or other disposition of the proceeds of such sale, and for the protection of any or all persons whose interests are affected by such order, and for all such incidental, consequential and supplemental matters as the court may deem just.\n(ii) The approval of the holders of any such bonds or debentures may be given by resolution passed at a meeting, by the votes of the holders of a majority in principal amount of such bonds or debentures represented and voting in person or by proxy, and holding not less than fifty per centum in principal amount, or such lesser amount as the court under all the circumstances may approve, of the issued and outstanding bonds or debentures in question. 1935, c. 32, s. 22.\nUrquhart J. has construed the section as enabling the Court to sanction a sale on terms which will yield the mortgagors a substantial part of the sale price while yielding the mortgagees only a portion of their debt. It is well settled that statutes which limit or extend common law rights and which detract from rights of ownership must be expressed in clear and unambiguous language (vide Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 2nd Ed., Vol. 31, p. 502, s. 645, and cases there cited). I can find no words in the section which are apt to bring about so revolutionary a change in the respective rights of mortgagees and mortgagors on a sale of the mortgaged premises.\nThe effect of the section is, I think, to create a new procedure in an action on a bond mortgage. It enables a majority of the bondholders to bind all the bondholders by the terms of a sale of the mortgaged premises for a consideration wholly or partly other than cash, but the power so given is made subject to the safeguard that it may be exercised only upon the Court being satisfied that the terms are fair and reasonable having regard to the interest of all parties interested in the premises. I find nothing in the section, certainly nothing in express words, to suggest that the consideration received shall be dealt with, as between the mortgagee and the mortgagor, in any manner other than that long established in equity; that is to say the mortgagee is entitled to receive the full amount of his debt and must account to the mortgagor only for the surplus, if any, remaining thereafter.\nIn the case of a sale for cash this is a mere matter of accounting; but when the sale is for other than cash it is necessary to determine what portion of the consideration is a fair equivalent of the mortgage debt and should therefore become the property of the mortgagee and what, if anything, remains for the mortgagor. No doubt cases may arise where there is room for difference of opinion as to whether the portion of the consideration proposed to be treated as payment of the mortgage debt is a fair equivalent of that debt, and in such cases the bona fide opinion of the majority bondholders may well be allowed to govern the minority. The owners of the equity also have a vital interest in the matter if it can be suggested that the total consideration is of greater value than the amount of the mortgage debt. Considerations such as these, and the list is not intended to be exhaustive, would seem to give meaning to the words of the section stressed by Urquhart J. \u201chaving regard to the interests of all parties interested in the premises and property so mortgaged\u201d. I do not think that these words should be interpreted as enabling the Court to sanction the appropriation of part of the consideration for the sale to the owners of the equity in a case where it is clear that part only of the mortgage debt is being satisfied.\nIn the case at bar, if the lowest figure mentioned in any valuation is taken, the mortgaged premises would appear to be worth $165,000. If from this is deducted the difference between the amount of the first mortgage and the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies held as collateral thereto, there remains a net value of $134,325. Under the proposal put forward the mortgage debt, which with interest amounts to $164,182.52, is to be extinguished by the payment of $71,100 in cash or paid up preference shares and the balance of the consideration is to go to the owners of the equity. It was not suggested that the four per cent non-cumulative preference shares could be reasonably regarded as worth more than their par value.\nOn its face the proposal does not seem attractive from the bondholders\u2019 point of view nor such as should be forced upon an unwilling minority. It is said, however, that the majority of the bonds have been voted in favour of the proposal and that the Court should not, in the words of McTague J. \u201csubstitute its judgment for the business judgment of reasonable men voting in their own interest\u201d (Montreal Trust Co. v. Abitibi Power & Paper Co.[5] On the material in this case, I do not think that the proposal could be held to be reasonable having regard to the interests of the minority bondholders.\nIt will be remembered that all the bonds voted in favour of the proposal were owned by Mr. J.M. Hickey. It is conceded by all counsel that Mr. Hickey has acted throughout in good faith; but I can find no support in the material for the finding of Urquhart J. that Mr. Hickey \u201cthought what he did was the best in his own interest\u201d or that the rejection of the proposal would \u201cput his holdings in jeopardy\u201d.\nTwo affidavits made by Mr. Hickey appear in the material but neither of them touches on his motives for supporting the plan, although they negative any sugges- tion that he was acting as agent of the appellants. It seems to me that Mr. Hickey\u2019s motive is to be inferred from the wording of the plan. The plan points out that most of the outstanding bonds were acquired by their present holders for a fraction of their face value so that if the bonds are now surrendered on payment of the principal only the investment will have been a profitable one for the bondholders; that the bondholders\u2019 position has been greatly improved by the action of the appellants in purchasing and surrendering $63,900 of the bonds; that the appellants have made a total investment in the property of a very large amount all of which they are in danger of losing if the bondholders insist on their full legal rights; that the appellants have had no income from their investment during a period of twenty years while the total interest payments to the bondholders have been very substantial and that the present comparatively satisfactory condition of the investment is the result of the strenuous, prolonged and unrewarded efforts of the appellants. Following the recital of these facts the plan contains the following:\nWe appeal to your sense of justice and fair play. We ask you to conscientiously review the facts that we have given you. If you do that we are confident you will give this plan your support.\nThe plan is, I think, a frankly worded appeal to the generosity and fair-mindedness of the bondholders. It does not attempt to disguise the fact, which would appear from the figures as to the value of the premises quoted above to be self-evident, that, if minded to do so, the bondholders can obtain payment of a substantially greater proportion of the mortgage debt than is offered by the plan.\nThis is not a case in which we are considering findings of fact made by the judge of first instance after hearing viva voce evidence. The application was argued and decided on affidavits and an appellate court is in as good a position as was the learned judge who heard the motion to draw inferences from the facts deposed to. I think the proper inference is that Mr. Hickey was moved to vote as he did by generosity and by an appreciation of the strong moral claims put forward by the appellants. Having reached this conclusion I think that we are bound by authority to hold that a resolution passed by votes cast with such a motive cannot stand. I think that the principle to be applied is set out in the following passages from the judgment of the Judicial Committee in British America Nickel Corporation v. O\u2019Brien[6]. At page 371 Viscount Haldane says:\nBefore their Lordships proceed to consider the somewhat involved circumstances in which the question arises, it will be convenient that (they should refer to the principle to be applied in weighing the outcome of these circumstances.\nTo give a power to modify the terms on which debentures in a company are secured is not uncommon in practice. The business interests of the company may render such a power expedient, even in the interests of the class of debenture holders as a whole. The provision is usually made in the form of a power, conferred by the instrument constituting the debenture security, upon the majority of the class of holders. It often enables them to modify, by resolution properly passed, the security itself. The provision of such a power to a majority bears some analogy to such a power as that conferred by s. 13 of the English Companies Act of 1908, which enables a majority of the shareholders by special resolution to alter the articles of association. There is, however, a restriction of such powers, when conferred on a majority of a special class in order to enable that majority to bind a minority. They must be exercised subject to a general principle, which is applicable to all authorities conferred on majorities of classes enabling them to bind minorities; namely, that the power given must be exercised for the purpose of benefiting the class as a whole, and not merely individual members only. Subject to this, the power may be unrestricted. It may be free from the general principle in question when the power arises not in connection with a class, but only under a general title which confers the vote as a right of property attaching to a share. The distinction does not arise in this case, and it is not necessary to express an opinion as to its ground. What does arise is the question whether there is such a restriction on the right to vote of a creditor or member of an analogous class on whom is conferred a power to vote for the alteration of the title of a minority of the class to which he himself belongs.\nViscount Haldane then proceeds to discuss the cases of Northwest Transportaton Company v. Beatty[7] and Burland v. Earle[8] and continues:\nIt has been suggested that the decision in these two cases on the last point is difficult to reconcile with the restriction already referred to, where the power is conferred, not on shareholders generally, but on a special class, say, of debenture holders, where a majority, in exercising a power to modify the rights of a minority, must exercise that power in the interests of the class as a whole. This is a principle which goes beyond that applied in Menier v. Hooper\u2019s Telegraph Works[9], inasmuch as it does not depend on misappropriation or fraud being proved. But their Lordships do not think that there is any real difficulty in combining the principle that while usually a holder of shares or debentures may vote as his interest directs, he is subject to the further principle that where his vote is conferred on him as a member of a class he must conform to the interest of the class itself when seeking to exercise the power conferred on him in his capacity of being a member. The second principle is a negative one, one which puts a restriction on the completeness of freedom under the first, without excluding such freedom wholly.\nI think that the words of Lord Cairns in Ex parte Cowen. In re Cowen[10] are applicable to the case at bar. The effect of the judgment is accurately summarized in the head-note as follows:\nThe power given by the 192nd section of the Bankruptcy Act, 1862, enabling the majority of creditors assenting to a deed of arrangement to bind the non-assenting minority, is a statutory power, and must be exercised bona fide for the benefit of all the creditors.\nAt page 570 Lord Cairns says:\nBut even without any ingredient of fraud, if the creditors, from motives of charity and benevolence, which might be highly honourable to them, were willing to give the debtor a discharge on payment of a composition wholly disproportioned to his assets, that would not be such a bargain as the Act requires, and would not bind the non-assenting minority.\nI cannot find on the material that Mr. Hickey exercised his voting power for the purpose of benefiting the class of bondholders as a whole although, if I may borrow the words of Lord Cairns, I think that his motives were highly honourable to him.\nFor the above reasons I think that the resolution approving the plan cannot stand and that this appeal should be dismissed.\nI should mention that while it appears to have been argued in the Courts below that section 15 (i) of the Ontario Judicature Act is ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature, no such argument was addressed to us and for the purposes of this appeal I have assumed, without deciding, that the section is valid. I do not mean by this form of expression to suggest that I entertain any doubt of its validity in a case where no question of insolvency is raised.\nOrdinarily, when we are dismissing an appeal we should not, I think, vary the order as to costs made by the Court of Appeal; but I understood all counsel to assent to the view expressed by Mr. Wilson at the conclusion of his able opening argument that, regardless of the outcome of the appeal, all costs should be ordered to be paid out of the assets in the possession of the Canada Trust Company as receiver and I think that under the peculiar circumstances of the case this is a proper course to follow. I would therefore dismiss the appeal and direct that the costs of all parties of the motion before Urquhart J., of the appeal to the Court of Appeal and of the appeal to this Court be paid forthwith after taxation thereof by the Canada Trust Company out of the property and assets in its possession as receiver and manager, the costs of the plaintiffs as between solicitor and client.\nRAND J.:\u2014As I apprehend it, the judgment of the Court of Appeal centres on the view that, as the effect of section 15 (i) of The Judicature Act is to enlarge a power of sale under a trust deed or similar instrument by annexing to it authority to sell for a consideration in whole or part other than cash, the sale proposed here, being that of the equity of redemption and not under the power, is unauthorized.\nThe provision, in the statute, for terms which the Court \u201cshall think fair and reasonable having regard to the interests of all parties interested in the premises\u201d, and \u201cfor the protection of any or all persons whose interests are affected by such order\u201d, including those of the mortgagor, particularly as contrasted with the language of the subsection as enacted in 1917 and repealed by the amendment now in force, makes it clear, whether the power is viewed as purely statutory or as an addition to that provided by the deed, that in such a transaction, the senior security holders and the Court may approve of benefits to junior interests: and I see no reason why it should not extend to the case where the mortgagor is an individual.\nThe language of the proposal is not as apt and precise to the form contemplated as it might be; but that it is intended to propose a disposal appropriate to and made under the relief claimed in the proceedings is, I think, unquestionable. There is nothing technical necessary to its language and why any interested party should not be at liberty to make it has not been made apparent. What must be looked at is the arrangement as a whole and the object in view. In the preliminary stages of meetings and approval, there was no doubt in the minds of any of those now objecting of what was being put before them, and there is equally no doubt of that in my mind: it was and is a sale in the proceedings on the terms presented, and the proceedings are within the very words of the section.\nThat being the case, can the terms be said to be fair and reasonable? The conditions in which this legislation was enacted are a matter of common knowledge. We were in the depths of a worldwide depression, which, in this country, reached unexampled proportions. The terms are to be \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d. What is \u201cfair\u201d to the mortgagee? to the mortgagor? This is not an oft-used word in the ordinary statutory vocabulary relating to mortgages; and the question which meets us at the outset is, can the existing balance sheet between the two parties be deliberately altered in favour of the mortgagor?\nThat question is one of difficulty, but I have been driven to the conclusion that where, as against a sale for cash, the terms could not prejudice the mortgagor and could not add to the benefit or interest of the mortgagee, the obligation cannot be altered for the purpose of transferring a possible benefit to the mortgagor. No one here suggests a sale for cash; the interest of both mortgagee and mortgagor seems to lie in working out the debt over a long term; but in that form, to require the mortgagee to surrender part of his claim is to transfer a possible benefit from him to the mortgagor. If, in the end, only the amount as reduced should be realized, the mortgagee would take all; if any more were realized, he would so far be prejudiced to the advantage of the mortgagor.\nThe ordinary rule is that such a right can be impaired only by clear and precise language of legislation, but that is not the nature of the language before us. The bonds have the entire solvency of the mortgagor to support them, and to cut the amount down except by a discharge in bankruptcy has uniformly been looked upon as an exceptional exercise of legislative power. The conduct of the mortgagor in relation to this matter has admittedly been most meritorious; his appeal for consideration is corre- spondingly strong; and one may be without any sympathy whatever with the action and attitude of the mortgagee. But the desirability of adjusting the interests of these parties in the \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d manner conceived by Urquhart J. is one that must be decided by the legislature and declared, not by general words which leave the long established underlying rules of interpretation untouched but, as in the case of the Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, S. of C., 1934, c. 53, by words which are unmistakable in intent.\nI am, therefore, unable to find that the proposed terms are within the section, and the appeal must be dismissed. The costs of all parties will be paid out of the property.\nESTEY J.:\u2014This is an appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal in Ontario reversing an order approving a sale of property under s. 15 (i) of The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 100.\nMathew and Tekla Hanson, with a view to the construction of the new Annandale Apartments in the City of Kingston, under date of June 20, 1929, arranged with United Bond Company Limited to underwrite a bond issue of $135,000 with interest at 6 \u00bd per cent secured by a first mortgage.\nOn November 12, 1930, the mortgagors having made default, action was commenced by writ of summons in the Supreme Court of Ontario to enforce the mortgage dated June 20, 1929, for $135,000, and for the appointment of the London and Western Trust Company Limited as receiver and manager. On December 18, 1930, the said Trust Company was appointed receiver and manager and it or its successor, The Canada Trust Company, has been in receipt of the rents and profits at all times since that date. The apartment at that time was 75 per cent completed. It was finished by virtue of a further loan of $60,000 from the Ontario Equitable Life Insurance Company of Canada secured by a mortgage which was given priority over that for the $135,000 securing the bonds.\nOn May 30, 1949, Mr. Justice Barlow in the foregoing action authorized under s. 15(i) the holding of a meeting of the bondholders to consider the sale of the property for a consideration other than cash. The meeting was held on June 20, 1949. At that time there were $71,100 of the original $135,000 bonds outstanding, of which $66,500 were represented at the meeting. The proposed sale was approved by a vote representing $35,650 in favour, while the holders of $30,850 voted against it. (This figure of $30,850 was later corrected to read $31,300, and the total therefore represented at the meeting was $66,950.) One person owned all the bonds voted in favour of the sale.\nOn June 20, 1949, the first mortgage in favour of the Ontario Equitable Life Insurance Co. amounted to $57,500 with a cash surrender value in the four insurance policies held as collateral thereto of $26,825. The net mortgage position was therefore $30,675 plus $71,100 of bonds and unpaid interest on these bonds of $93,082.50, or a total in mortgage indebtedness of $194,857.50 of the original mortgage indebtedness of $195,000.\nThe proposed purchaser, Hanson Apartments Limited, is a corporation of which the mortgagors obtained the incorporation for the purpose of concluding the proposed sale. The capital stock consists of (a) 1500 4 per cent non-cumulative preference shares par value of $50 each, (b) 1200 common shares without nominal or par value.\nThe proposal is that Hanson Apartments Limited would purchase \u201cthe equity of Mathew Hanson and Tekla Hanson in the New Annandale property\u201d and would pay therefor 1200 common shares. Hanson Apartments Limited would borrow upon the security of the New Annandale property and the cash surrender value in the policies of insurance above mentioned a sum sufficient to pay off the $57,500 of the first mortgage to the Ontario Equitable Life Insurance Company of Canada, and such further amount as might be required to pay to those holders of the $71,100 bonds who desired to be paid cash. These bondholders might elect to take either cash or the 4 per cent non-cumulative preference shares. The plan provided for the retirement of the preference shares, but so long as they were held by the bondholders, the latter would share equal voting rights with the common shareholders. The mortgagors in presenting the proposal described it as \u201ceminently fair and equitable.\u201d These bonds they emphasized were quoted in the 1930\u2019s as low as $200 a thousand and had gradually increased until the end of 1948 \u201cthe quoted bid price had increased to $920 a thousand.\u201d This, it was suggested, was due largely to the fact that the mortgagors had purchased these bonds which, in terms of par value, totalled $63,900 and had, in 1931, surrendered them to the trustees. They point out that had they not done so the present \u201coffer of a full return of capital on second mortgage bonds would be impossible\u201d; that there are very few of those who purchased bonds originally who are now the holders thereof and that the great majority of the present holders purchased them as a speculative investment and, in particular, those who had purchased bonds at less than $680 have, since 1943, received an \u201cimpressive\u201d rate of interest; that over the 20 year period the bondholders had received 3 per cent simple interest on the par value of the bonds, while the mortgagors\u2019 investment of $150,000 had remained frozen without income and in continual jeopardy. The plan concluded:\nWe appeal to your sense of justice and fair play. We ask you to conscientiously review the facts that we have given you. If you do that we are confident you will give this plan your support.\nThe minority bondholders contend that the sale is not fair and reasonable. They point to their contractual rights and the mortgage position of the premises; that the first two coupons were paid on the respective due dates December 20, 1929, and June 30, 1930. No. 3 coupon was not paid until June 20, 1943. Thereafter coupons were apparently paid as and when funds permitted. Since 1943 nine coupons have been paid in full and there is still outstanding a total of over $93,000 of unpaid interest; that, in fact, the mortgagors have no equity in the premises and through this sale seek to acquire an immediate equity about equal to the arrears of interest in an amount of over $93,000.\nSec. 15(i) provides that after the bondholders have approved of the sale then\nthe court may in such action order and approve such sale on such terms in all respects as the court shall think fair and reasonable having regard to the interests of all parties interested in the premises and property. The first mortgagee (The Equitable Life Insurance Company of Canada) would, under the plan, be paid in full and has taken no part in this application. The parties whose interests, therefore, must be considered are the bondholders and mortgagors.\nThe provisions of sec. 15(i) require consideration of the terms of the proposed sale rather than its origin or purpose. Wherever or however the sale may originate, the approval authorized by the Statute is of a sale the terms of which are \u201cfair and reasonable having regard to the interests of all parties interested in the premises and property.\u201d Many of the factors which have been urged in support of this plan may be of importance if the matter were to be considered from another point of view, but they do not assist in determining whether the sale is fair and reasonable within the meaning of the Statute.\nAffidavits were filed in which the deponents expressed their respective opinions as to the value of this property and these varied from $165,000 to $250,000. If a valuation approximating $200,000 be accepted, a sale for that amount would discharge the mortgage indebtedness of a;bout $195,000 in full. At the hearing it seemed to be the opinion that either that amount or some amount approximating $225,000 would be a fair value. If the property was sold at the latter amount the equity of the mortgagor would be approximately $30,000. Under the present plan the bondholders forego over $93,000 of interest and, if they accept bonds, their interest rate is reduced from 6 \u00bd per cent to 4 per cent and it would seem that the benefit of this reduction would pass to the mortgagors who, if the plan worked out as contemplated, would ultimately own the shares in Hanson Apartments Limited.\nA statement of receipts and disbursements was filed for the 7 \u00bd year period from January 1, 1941, to June 15, 1949. It disclosed that for that period the property had not earned sufficient to pay the carrying charges and the interest in full. No attempt, however, was made to break down or analyze the 7 \u00bd year financial statement, or to compute, upon the basis thereof, what the property ought to realize at a sale. Moreover, one of the valuators stated:\nThe apartments are attractive and I should consider they would always be in demand * * * It seems to me that the rentals of all the apartments are low, particularly the upper five-room apartments.\nHe suggested the low rents were due to rent control.\nS. 15(i), in providing for a sale in judicial proceedings for a consideration other than cash, effects a change in the common law. Apart from this express change it would appear the Legislature intended the sale here contemplated should retain all its other common law attributes. When, moreover, the section provides \u201ca Court may * * * order and approve such sale on such terms in all respects as the Court shall think fair and reasonable having regard to the interests of all parties interested in the premises * * *\u201d, it clearly expresses the factors that ought to be considered upon an application for the Court\u2019s approval.\nUnder the terms of the proposed sale the mortgagees forego the items above indicated and the mortgagors, through Hanson Apartments Incorporated, benefit thereby. This is sought to be justified upon the basis that the history of the property and the contribution of the mortgagors have been such that the mortgagees ought to accept this sale as \u201ceminently fair and equitable.\u201d A sale supported only upon that basis is not contemplated by the statute. Then when regard is had to the valuation of the premises filed as a part of this record, as well as the desirability of the premises and the low rents that have been realized, there is absent in the material the evidence which would support a conclusion that the sale is fair and reasonable within the meaning of s. 15.\nThe respondent bondholders not only opposed the approval of the sale on the basis that it is not fair and reasonable, but that the approval of the majority bondholder is not, in the circumstances, valid within the meaning of the section. They do not suggest bad faith on his part. They do contend, however, that in casting his vote he did not exercise a sound business judgment qua bondholder, but rather was unduly influenced to do so out of consideration for the mortgagors. The record discloses that this bondholder has acted as solicitor for the mortgagors on other occasions, in particular upon a similar but unsuccessful application in this action in 1939. He acquired a number of these bonds in his own right and, as he deposed:\nIn 1948, finding myself with a substantial investment in Annandale bonds but not with the majority of the bonds outstanding, I purchased some bonds at a premium over par for the purpose of holding the majority of the bonds to protect my investment.\nMoreover, the appellants point to the fact that in submitting this plan to the bondholders the mortgagors ask that those bondholders who were favourable to the plan and who propose to vote by proxy should nominate the majority bondholder as their proxy.\nThe authority of the majority to bind the minority is contained in s. 15(i) and the relevant principle to be applied is stated by Viscount Haldane:\nBut their Lordships do not think that there is any real difficulty in combining the principle that while usually a holder of shares or debentures may vote as his interests directs, he is subject to the further principle that where his vote is conferred on him as a member of a class he must conform to the interest of the class itself when seeking to exercise the power conferred on him in his capacity of being a member. The second principle is a negative one, one which puts a restriction on the completeness of freedom under the first, without excluding such freedom wholly. British America Nickel Corporation v. O\u2019Brien[11].\nAnd at p. 378 (1128 D.L.R.):\nBut as that vote had come to him as a member of a class he was bound to exercise it with the interests of the class itself kept in view as dominant.\nThat such must be the dominating factor is emphasized by Lord Cairns in Ex parte Cowen[12]:\nBut even without any ingredient of fraud, if the creditors, from motives of charity and benevolence, which might be highly honourable to them, were willing to give the debtor a discharge on payment of a composition wholly disproportioned to his assets, that would not be such a bargain as the Act requires, and would not bind the non-assenting minority.\nBut if not * * * that these assenting creditors, being connected with the debtor, or his personal friends, and wishing to shew kindness and generosity to him, were content to take this nominal composition, and to give him his discharge. In that case, although the transaction might not amount to a fraud, yet it was not a bona fide bargain, and could not bind the minority. In either view of the case, therefore, the Commissioner was right, and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nThe majority bondholder acquired, in 1948, sufficient additional bonds at a price above par in order that he might have a majority thereof for the purpose of protecting his investment, and in 1949 cast his vote in favour of the approval of a sale that, in effect, cancelled all arrears of interest upon these bonds and reduced his return from 6 \u00bd per cent to 4 per cent if he accepted preferred shares, while the other bondholders holding a very substantial proportion of the bonds opposed the sale. Without in any way doubting his good faith, these circumstances, unexplained as they are, support the view that the majority bondholder, in voting in favour of the plan, was prompted to do so by reasons of benevolence rather than those business considerations which one would take into account when determining a vote in the interests of the bondholders.\nThe appeal should be dismissed, the costs of all parties to be paid by the Canada Trust Company out of the assets in its possession as receiver and manager of the property in question. The trustees will have their costs on a solicitor and client basis.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing an order of Urquhart J. made under the provisions of section 15 (i) of The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 100, approving the sale of the New Annandale Apartments in Kingston, the property of the appellants, under the following circumstances.\nBy a mortgage and deed of trust dated the 20th day of June, 1929, the appellants mortgaged and charged the property in question in favour of the London and Western Trusts Company Limited and Howard C. Wade to secure the payment of an issue of bonds in the principal amount of $135,000 payable over a period of seven years, together with interest at 6 \u00bd per cent per annum. The purpose of the bond issue was to finance the building of the apartment block but, while bonds to the full amount made their way into the hands of the public, only a portion of the amount realized was received by the mortgagors, owing mainly to the subsequent insolvency of the fiscal agents employed in marketing the bonds, and the amounts received were insufficient to complete the building. Defaults having been made under the mortgage the trustees on November 12, 1930, issued a writ, endorsed with a claim to enforce the deed of trust, for the appointment of the London and Western Trusts Company Limited as receiver and manager, and for possession. By an order of the Supreme Court of Ontario made on December 18, 1930, the trust company was appointed receiver and manager of all the property and assets covered by the mortgage on behalf of the mortgagees and the holders of first mortgage bonds. On January 27, 1931, a further order was made granting liberty to the receiver to borrow a sum of $60,000 from the Ontario Equitable Life and Accident Insurance Company for the purpose of completing the building and permitting the appellants to execute a mortgage to secure the amount, such mortgage to constitute a first charge upon the property and assets in priority to the mortgage of June 20, 1929. With these further moneys the building was completed: the London and Western Trusts Company Limited continued in possession as receiver, collecting the rents and managing the property until the acquisition of the undertaking and assets of that company by the respondent the Canada Trust Company early in the year 1947: since that time these duties have been performed by the last named company. By an order of October 31, 1947, it was directed that the action commenced in November 1930 be continued in the name of the said Canada Trust Company and the respondent Glendinning who, by an order made in February, 1932, had been substituted as trustee in the place of Wade. The result of the operation of the property by the receiver up to the date of the present application of the appellants has been to reduce the principal amount of the first mortgage to the Ontario Equitable Life and Accident Insurance Company to the amount of $57,500 to maintain in force life insurance policies taken out in 1931 as additional security for the said company\u2019s loan then having a cash surrender value of $26,825 and to maintain the property. The appellants during this period have purchased and retired bonds of the principal amount of $63,900 of the original issue of $135,000 leaving bonds to the amount of $71,100 outstanding.\nOn March 7,1949, the appellants made a written proposal to the remaining holders of the bonds for what was in effect a compromise of their indebtedness. As expressed in the proposal, the plan was for the sale to a new company named Hanson Apartments Limited of the equity of Mathew and Tekla Hanson in the New Annandale property, the retirement of the outstanding bonds and discharge of the second mortgage by paying to the bondholders at their option either the principal amount of their bonds in cash or preference shares bearing a four per cent non-cumulative dividend to their face amount: the carrying out of the plan involved paying off the Equitable Life mortgage and the surrender to the new company of the cash surrender value of the insurance policies. On May 30, 1949, the trustees applied to the Supreme Court of Ontario for an order directing that a meeting of the holders of the bonds be convened to consider this offer and an order was made directing that such a meeting be held at the City of Toronto for the purpose of considering the plan proposed by the Hansons, and alternatively in default of the approval of that plan, either as proposed or as modified or amended, any other plan that might be proposed at the said meeting for the sale, transfer or exchange of the property and assets for a consideration wholly or in part other than cash. Pursuant to further directions in the order the Canada Trust Company gave written notice to the parties interested of a meeting called for the purpose of considering first \u201ca certain plan proposed by the said Mathew Hanson and Tekla Hanson dated the 7th day of March, 1949, providing for the sale, transfer or exchange of the property and assets described in the said mortgage and deed of trust for a consideration, wholly or in part, other than cash, all as therein set out;\u201d and secondly, in default of the approval of such offer, any other plan that might be proposed at the meeting. The meeting so called was held on June 20, 1949. At that time there were large arrears of interest payable on the outstanding bonds so that the cash offer represented less than the amounts due to the bondholders and, assuming the preference shares offered would have been worth no more than par, their value also was less. While the question as to whether the offer of the appellants was a fair offer of compromise is not, in my opinion, decisive of the matter, it is to be noted that the amount required to discharge the first mortgage of the Equitable Life after crediting the cash surrender value of the insurance policies was $28,350 and the principal amount outstanding on the bonds $71,100 a total of $99,450. The fair value of the property as shown by an affidavit filed in the proceedings on behalf of the present appellants was $175,000 while a valuator employed by the respondents considered that it would realize at a forced sale $225,000. The arrears of interest upon the outstanding bonds approximated $93,000 and the appellants\u2019 proposal involved a release of their indebtedness for this amount. Even if the personal covenants of the appellants had been without value, it is apparent that the bondholders would have realized a substantial amount of their claim for interest had the property been sold under the power of sale in the mortgage. The holders of the majority of the outstanding bonds, however, favoured the acceptance of the offer and the proposed sale was approved by the order of Urquhart J. made on September 15, 1949.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal proceeds upon the ground that subsection (i) of section 15 of the Judicature Act does not authorize the approval of a sale of mortgaged or charged premises other than one which is proposed to be made under the power of sale contained in a mortgage or trust deed. While the London and Western Trusts Company Limited had commenced action in 1930 to enforce the mortgage, for the appointment of a receiver and for possession and a receiver and manager had been appointed, no further steps had been taken in that action by the delivery of a statement of claim or otherwise, except an application made in the year 1939 which was dismissed and the present application to approve proposed sales of the property. While the present application was made in the name of the Canada Trust Company, it was not to approve a sale made under the power of sale contained in the mortgage but simply for the approval of a sale by the Hansons of their equity of redemption in the property to the new company upon the defined terms. Subsection (i) of section 15 was originally introduced into the Judicature Act (though not in its present form) by section 17 of the Statute Law Amendment Act, 1917 (Ont.) c. 27. That amendment provided that when debenture holders were entitled to a charge by virtue of a trust deed and under its terms a majority of them were given power to sanction the sale or exchange of the mortgaged premises for a consideration other than cash, the court should have power in any action brought for the purpose of realizing upon such mortgage or the execution of the trusts to sanction any such sale and to give the necessary directions for the purpose of carrying the same into effect and to direct the trustee to exercise all or any of the powers conferred by the trust deed. By The Judicature Amendment Act, 1935 this subsection was repealed and there was substituted therefor a subsection which, in so far as relevant, provides that in case bonds or debentures are secured by a mortgage or charge by virtue of a trust deed or other instrument and whether or not provision is made in such instrument giving to the holders of the bonds or a majority of them power to sanction the sale of the mortgaged premises for a consideration other than cash, and in case any action shall have been brought for the purpose of realizing upon the mortgage or for the execution of the trust in any trust deed, the court may order a meeting of the holders of the bonds to be summoned and, if they sanction or approve the sale of the property for a consideration wholly or in part other than cash, the court may in such action order and approve such sale on such terms as it may think fair and reasonable and may make provision for the transfer of the property to the purchaser, for the payment of the proper costs, charges and expenses of the trustee, for the distribution of the proceeds of such sale and for all such incidental, consequential and supplemental matters as it may deem just. It is further provided by the amendment that the approval of the holders of any such bonds may be given by resolution passed at a meeting by the votes of the holders of a majority in principal amount of such bonds or debentures and holding not less than fifty per cent of the issued and outstanding bonds.\nIn the present case the mortgage is expressed to be made in pursuance of the Short Forms of Mortgages Act (R.S.O. 1937, c. 160) and contains the statutory power of sale. The bonds secured by it and which are held by the respondents contain the covenant of the appellants to pay their principal amount and interest at the stipulated rate. In neither instrument is there any provision for calling meetings of the bondholders or giving to them or a specified majority of them power to sanction a sale of the premises, whether for cash or for a consideration other than cash, or enabling any such majority to authorize a sale of any kind. The contention of the appellants is that when the holders of a majority in principal amount of the bonds represented and voting at a meeting and holding not less than fifty per cent in principal amount approve a sale at such figure and upon such terms as they may approve, the court may authorize such a sale under the subsection even though, as in the present case, it involves depriving all of the bondholders of a substantial part of their claims. I do not think that any such power is vested in the court. Subsection (i) of section 15, as enacted by the amendment of 1917, appears to me to have been enacted solely for the purpose of providing a means whereby in proceedings by the mortgagee named in the mortgage and deed of trust to realize upon the security the court might sanction a sale for a consideration other than cash when under the terms of the trust deed the debenture holders or a majority of them were empowered to sanction such a sale and had exercised such power. As amended in 1935 the subsection vested this power in the court in proceedings by such a mortgagee to realize the security when the instrument did not contain provisions vesting this right in the debenture holders and I think that nothing more was intended. That amendment provides that in case the bonds are secured by a mortgage which does not contain any provision giving to the holders of the bonds or the majority of them power to sanction a sale of the mortgaged premises for a consideration other than cash, and in case an action has been brought for the purpose of realizing upon the security if the requisite majority of the bondholders approve a sale for such a consideration: \u201cthe court may in such action order and approve the sale.\u201d\nI think the clear meaning of this language to be that the sale referred to is a sale under the power contained in the mortgage. I find nothing in the subsection to indicate that it was intended to vest in the court power of the nature given to bankruptcy courts to enforce a compromise of debts against the will of the creditors or any part of them. The question as to whether or not the proposal is a fair one does not enter into the matter: the matter is one of jurisdiction and I respectfully agree with Mr. Justice Hope that the court was without power to make the order of September 15, 1949.\nThe appeal should be dismissed. I agree with the order as to costs proposed by my brother Cartwright.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellants: H.F. Gibson.\nSolicitor for the respondents: J.S.D.

The Excess Profits Tax Act 1940, S. of C. 1940, c. 32, s. 7(b) provides that the following profits shall not be liable to taxation: \"The profits of a profession carried on by an individual * * * if the profits of the profession are dependent wholly or mainly upon his * * * personal qualifications and if in the opinion of the Minister little or no capital is employed; provided that this exemption shall not extend to the profits of a commission agent or person any part of whose business consists in the making of contracts on behalf of others * * * unless the Minister is satisfied that such agent is virtually employed in the position of an employee of one employer in which case the exemption shall apply and in any case the decision of the Minister shall be final and conclusive.\"\nThe appellant, a commercial traveller, solicited orders for several firms and was paid by each a commission based on the amount of the orders secured by his efforts and paid for. His authority was confined to obtaining and transmitting orders. He was a free agent who maintained no office and employed only sufficient capital to operate a motor car and pay his travelling expenses. His claim for exemption from excess profits taxes under s. 7(b) was disallowed by the decision of the Minister of National Revenue and the Exchequer Court of Canada affirmed that decision.\nHeld: that the profits of a profession not liable to taxation under s. 7(b) of The Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 apply to a profession where the profits are dependent wholly or mainly upon personal qualifications. The finding of the Court below that the profits of the appellant did not either wholly or mainly depend upon his personal qualifications were supported by the evidence in the case and could not be disturbed and for that reason alone the appeal failed.\nHeld: also, that as it had not been contended that the Minister's decision, that he was not satisfied that the taxpayer was virtually employed in the position of an employee of one employer, was arbitrarily reached upon a wrong principle; that decision must stand.\n(Decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada [1949] Ex. C.R., 391 affirmed.)\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thorson J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada 1, dismissing the appeal of the appellant from the decision of the Minister of National Revenue affirming assessments levied upon the appellant for the years 1942, 1943 and 1944 under the provisions of The Excess Profits Tax Act.\nJ. C. Osborne for the appellant.\nW. R. Jackett K.C. and E. S. McLatchey for the respondent. The judgment of the Chief Justice, Taschereau, Rand and Estey, JJ. was delivered by:\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014It is unnecessary to recite the facts in this appeal. They are fully stated in the judgment of the learned President of the Exchequer Court 2 and at Bar counsel for the appellant declared that he accepted them as stated in that judgment.\nThe appellant is a commercial traveller and during the material years he represented several mills, or business houses. He did not make sales or contracts for the concerns for whom he acted, his authority being confined to obtaining orders for them and transmitting such orders to them. He assumed all expenses for the carrying out of his calling and in no year could it be said that his commissions came from only one concern. He was free to go and solicit orders as he saw fit for any one of the business concerns for whom he acted. He operated from his own house and selected his own customers, his remuneration depending on his own efforts and their results. He was not subject to the direction or control of any one of the business houses. He was independent of them and absolutely his own master. The learned President found that the merchandise for which the appellant solicited orders was the most important factor in his success.\nThe question is whether, under these circumstances, the appellant was properly assessed for Excess Profits Taxes and the learned President held that he was, on appeal from the decision of the Minister of National Revenue.\nThe decision of the Minister affirmed the assessment on the ground that \"the profits of the taxpayer have been correctly assessed for Excess Profits Tax\", adding that \"the Minister is not satisfied that the taxpayer is virtually in the position of an employee of one employer and he is therefore not exempt from tax under the proviso to paragraph (b) of Section 7 of The Excess Profits Tax Act.\"\nBy force of Section 3 (1) of that Act, in addition to any other tax or duty payable under any other Act, \"there shall be assessed, levied and paid a tax in accordance with the rate set out in the Third Part of the Second Schedule to this Act, during the taxation period.\" By section 2(1) (g) \"profits\" in the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation or joint stock company, for any taxation period, means the income of the said taxpayer derived from carrying on one or more businesses, as defined by section three of the Income War Tax Act, and before any deductions are made therefrom under any other provisions of the said Income War Tax Act.\nNow, although there is no definition of the word \"business\" in either the Income War Tax Act, or The Excess Profits Tax Act, it is easy to understand the meaning of the word \"business\" in the latter Act by the context of the Income War Tax Act. Of course, the appellant cannot be considered as exercising a \"profession\" within the meaning of that word in the usual language, but he relies on the use of the word \"profession\" in section 7 (b) of the Act, and he claims to be entitled to the exemption therein provided. As it can be said that it is important to consider every word of that section for the purpose of deciding the present appeal, the section is quoted in full:\n7. The following profits shall not be liable to taxation under this Act:\n(b) the profits of a profession carried on by an individual or by individuals in partnership if the profits of the profession are dependent wholly or mainly upon his or their personal qualifications and if in the opinion of the Minister little or no capital is employed: Provided that this exemption shall not extend to the profits of a commission agent or person any part of whose business consists in the making of contracts on behalf of others or the giving to other persons of advice of a commercial nature in connection with the making of contracts unless the Minister is satisfied that such agent is virtually in the position of an employee of one employer in which case this exemption shall apply and in any case the decision of the Minister shall be final and conclusive.\nIt will be noted from the wording of that section that the exemption applies first to a \"profession\" and by no means can the appellant, in the ordinary sense, be held to exercise a \"profession\". But, moreover, it is not \"all professions\" that can claim the exemption. It must be a \"profession\" where the profits are dependent wholly or mainly upon his personal qualifications; and the finding of the learned President that the profits of the appellant in the present case do not either wholly or mainly depend upon his personal qualifications but that, on the contrary, his merchandise is the most important factor in his success, cannot be disturbed upon the evidence in the case. For that reason alone, therefore, the appellant would fail to bring himself under the exemption of section 7(b). Of course, in order to claim the exemption, the appellant had first to show that his profits depended entirely, or at least mainly, upon his personal qualifications, but the proviso in the section must also be considered. He is not a commission agent, nor, as we have seen, does his business consist in the making of contracts on behalf of others, nor in the giving to other persons advice of a commercial nature in connection with the making of contracts. In these several respects the proviso does not apply to him.\nFinally, he was not able to satisfy the Minister that he was virtually in the position of an employee of one employer \u2014the evidence is decisive on the point that he is not such an employee. The decision of the Minister states that he was \"not satisfied that the taxpayer is virtually in the position of an employee of one employer and he is therefore not exempt from tax under the proviso to paragraph (b) of section 7 of The Excess Profits Tax Act.\" On that point the section enacts:\nIn any case the decision of the Minister shall be final and conclusive.\nIn this case, the decision of the Minister is to that effect. Therefore, as it has not been contended that the decision of the Minister was arbitrary and reached upon a wrong principle, it follows from all points of view that section 7(b) does not relieve the appellant.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nCartwright J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court pronounced on the 26th of October, 1949, affirming the decision of the Minister holding the appellant liable to taxation under The Excess Profits Tax Act in respect of his earnings as a commercial traveller during the years 1942, 1943 and 1944.\nThe following findings of fact made by the learned President are accepted by both parties:\nThe appellant is a commercial traveller and resides in London, Ontario. During the years in question he represented several mills or business houses, nine altogether in 1942 and 1943 and eight in 1944. His activities consisted in travelling throughout his territory with samples of the merchandise of the business concerns he represented, calling or customers, displaying the samples and soliciting and obtaining orders for the merchandise. When he obtained such orders he sent them to the credit manager of the mill or business house concerned. If the order was accepted the merchandise was shipped to the customer and thirty days after the date of such shipment the appellant was paid a commission based on its amount. He received no salary, wages or remuneration from any of the mills or business houses except these commissions and if a customer did not pay for the goods the commission that had been paid to him thereon was charged back to him. He did not make sales or contracts for the concerns for whom he acted, his authority being confined to obtaining orders for them and transmitting such orders to them. He had no office or office staff and no telephone, typewriter or stationery of his own. The samples he carried belonged to the concerns he represented. In the course of his activities he incurred expenses for such items as hotels and meals, baggage and sample rooms, telephone, telegrams and tips, rail fares and excess baggage, car, gasoline, oil, etc. He did not send in any expense accounts in respect of these items to any of his mills or business houses or apportion them amongst them but assumed them all himself. The particulars of his commissions with the amount received from each mill or business house for each of the years in question appear in his income tax returns. In no year could it be said that they came virtually from one concern.\nIt was admitted at the trial by counsel for the respondent that the appellant employed capital only to the extent sufficient to maintain a car and to pay his expenses on the road. One further finding of fact made by the learned President is as follows:\nThe appellant has not shown that his profits, even if it were conceded that they are those of a profession, depended wholly or mainly upon his personal qualifications. When he was asked what his success as a commercial traveller depended upon he mentioned his personality, his ability to show his merchandise to the best advantage, his health and his experience but on cross-examination he stated that his merchandise was the most important factor in his success.\nIn my view this finding is supported by the evidence.\nThe main grounds relied upon in support of the appeal were, first, that the appellant's earnings were not \"profits\" within the meaning of the charging provisions of The Excess Profits Tax Act and secondly, that even if such earnings fell prima facie within the terms of such charging provisions they were exempt under the terms of section 7(b) of the Act.\nIt was submitted by counsel for the respondent that on the pleadings the first point was not open but I think it desirable to deal with the appeal on the assumption, but without deciding, that the point is properly before us. By section 3 of The Excess Profits Tax Act the tax claimed is levied upon the profits of every person residing or ordinarily resident in Canada or who is carrying on business in Canada. The relevant definition of \"profits\" is contained in section 2(g):\n(g) \"Profits\" in the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation or joint stock company, for any taxation period, means the income of the said taxpayer derived from carrying on one or more businesses, as defined by section three of the Income War Tax Act, and before any deductions are made therefrom under any other provisions of the said Income War Tax Act;\nThe relevant words of section 3 of the Income War Tax Act are as follows:\n3. (1) For the purposes of this Act, \"income\" means the annual net profit or gain or gratuity, whether ascertained and capable of computation as being wages, salary, or other fixed amount, or unascertained as being fees or emoluments, or as being profits from a trade or commercial or financial or other business or calling, directly or indirectly received by a person from any office or employment, or from any profession or calling, or from any trade, manufacture or business, as the case may be whether derived from sources within Canada or elsewhere; and shall include the interest, dividends or profits directly or indirectly received from money at interest upon any security or without security, or from stocks, or from any other investment, and, whether such gains or profits are divided or distributed or not, and also the annual profit or gain from any other source including * * *\nIt is suggested that section 3 of the Income War Tax Act divides all earned income into three classes according to whether it is received from (i) any office or employment or (ii) any profession or calling or (iii) any trade, manufacture or business, and that the words in section 2(g) of The Excess Profits Tax Act \"Income derived from carrying on one or more businesses\" refer to income received from source (iii) to the exclusion of that received from sources (i) and (ii); and that the income earned by a commercial traveller is more aptly described as being derived from a \"calling\" than from a \"business\". It is suggested that the words in section 3 of the Income War Tax Act \"profits from a trade, or commercial or financial or other business or calling\" also show that the word \"business\" is used in contradistinction from the word \"calling\". It seems to me from reading the last mentioned section as a whole that the purpose of Parliament was not to subdivide earned income into classes according to its source but rather to use words which would embrace earned income from every source. I do not think that the words \"business\" or \"calling\" are used in the section as terms of art intended to define mutually exclusive categories of sources of income but in the popular and ordinary sense and, so used, I think that the words \"profits derived from a commercial or financial or other business\" are wide enough to include the earnings of a commercial traveller.\nIt was further argued in support of the first ground of appeal that when The Excess Profits Tax Act is read as a whole it appears that the intention of Parliament was to tax only such persons as employ capital in their businesses and that the whole scheme of the Act contemplates the taxation of abnormal return on capital received during the life of the Act. It appears to me that the words of the charging section are too wide to permit so restricted an application. If the matter were doubtful, a consideration of the words of section 7(b) would seem to indicate that the fact that little or no capital is employed by a person is not alone sufficient to create an exemption from taxation under the Act.\nIn my view the earnings of the appellant fall within the terms of the charging provisions and are liable to tax unless specially exempted.\nIt now becomes necessary to examine the second main ground of appeal, that the appellant is entitled to exemption under the terms of section 7(b) reading as follows:\n7. The following profits shall not be liable to taxation under this Act:\n(b) the profits of a profession carried on by an individual or by individuals in partnership if the profits of the profession are dependent wholly or mainly upon his or their personal qualifications and if in the opinion of the Minister little or no capital is employed: Provided that this exemption shall not extend to the profits of a commission agent or person any part of whose business consists in the making of contracts on behalf of others or the giving to other persons of advice of a commercial nature in connection with the making of contracts unless the Minister is satisfied that such agent is virtually in the position of an employee of one employer in which case this exemption shall apply and in any case the decision of the Minister shall be final and conclusive * * *\nAssuming, without deciding, that the appellant's occupation falls within the meaning of the word \"profession\" as used in this clause, and without passing upon the submission of counsel for the respondent that the opinion of the Minister that little or no capital is employed has not been obtained, I think that this argument cannot prevail. It is a condition of the operation of the exemption that the profits of the person claiming it be dependent wholly or mainly upon his personal qualifications. On this question of fact the learned President has found against the appellant and, as stated above, I think this finding is supported by the evidence. I therefore do not find it necessary to consider the proviso to the clause.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Raymond, Spencer, Law & Maclnnes.\nSolicitor for the respondent: R.

The proper remedy where the validity of a provincial law (the Quebec Cities and Towns Act), and a municipal by-law authorized thereby is questioned, is by way of writ of Prohibition (art. 1003 C.P.), or by way of writ of Certiorari (arts. 1392, 1393), and since when a case is submitted to this Court for final determination it is desirable that it should have the opinion of the highest court of the Province from which the appeal is taken, this Court, in the exercise of the discretion vested in it under s. 41, should refuse leave to appeal until such opinion has been obtained.\nUnder s. 41(3) the Court may grant special leave to appeal on a question of law or jurisdiction, but the question of law raised must be a question of law alone and not a mixed question of law and fact.

G. How for the motion.\nPaul Miquelon K.C. contra. The judgment of the Court was delivered by:\nTASCHEREAU J.:\u2014The petitioner has applied to this Court for special leave to appeal under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 35, as amended by 13 Geo. VI, 1949, 2nd Sess., c. 37, s. 2.\nThe Town of Beauport has enacted a by-law bearing No. 120, prohibiting the distribution of circulars, and was authorized to do so by virtue of a provision of the Cities and Towns Act, c. 233, 1941, as amended by 11 Geo. VI, c. 59, s. 7, sub-sec. (b). This amendment reads as follows:\n15a. To prohibit the distribution of circulars, advertisements, prospectuses or other similar printed matters, on the streets, avenues, lanes, sidewalks, public lands and places as well as in private dwellings, or to authorize such distribution, upon conditions determined by the by-law and on issuance of a permit for which a fee may be exigible;\nOn or about the 21st of April, 1950, the petitioner distributed circulars in the streets of the Town of Beauport, in violation of the by-law, as no copy was deposited at the office of the Council of the Town, and approved by the Secretary-Treasurer of the Council. The petitioner was therefore charged under the Cities and Towns Act (sections 610 and 617), which state that the fines imposed by the by-laws are recoverable before a District Magistrate, or before a Justice of the Peace, and that all prosecutions shall be decided by either of them, according to the rules contained in Part I of the Quebec Summary Convictions Act, c. 29, R.S.Q., 1941.\nDistrict Magistrate Andr\u00e9 R\u00e9gnier who heard the case found the petitioner guilty, and condemned him to a fine of $40 and costs, and in default of payment to a period of two months imprisonment. The petitioner admitted having distributed the circulars without having obtained the prior authorization required by by-law No. 120, but submitted that the by-law was ultra vires as well as the provincial law authorizing the Town of Beauport to enact such a by-law. He alternatively contended that, if the by-law and the provincial statute were intra vires of the powers of the City of Beauport and of the Provincial Parliament, he did not fall within the scope of such by-law for various reasons, and particularly for the reason that in distributing such pamphlet, being a Witness of Jehovah, he was lawfully exercising his rights of freedom of worship as guaranteed by the Freedom of Worship Act. (R.S.Q. 1941, c. 307).\nUnder the Summary Convictions Act, there is no appeal from the judgment rendered by Magistrate R\u00e9gnier to any provincial court. No appeal lies unless the statute creating the offence declares that there is an appeal, and in such a case, it is lodged under Part 2 of the Act. Counsel for the petitioner submitted that by virtue of section 41 of the Supreme Court Act as amended, the Supreme Court of Canada may grant leave to appeal on the ground that the judgment rendered by Magistrate R\u00e9gnier is \"a final judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province, in which judgment can be had in the case sought to be appealed to this Court.\" He further submitted that under section 41, para. 3, there is an appeal to this Court with special leave on a \"question of law or jurisdiction\", as the petitioner has been convicted of an offence \"other than an indictable offence.\" He finally argued that as the validity of a provincial law of the Province of Quebec and the validity of a by-law of the Town of Beauport were challenged, as well as the application of the by-law to the petitioner, important questions of law of general application arose, and that special leave to appeal should be granted.\nDealing with the first point, namely the validity of the by-law and of the provincial law, I believe that leave to appeal to this Court should not be granted.\nWe are dealing here with a provincial criminal offence (Saumur v. Recorder's Court of Quebec 1). If, therefore, this Court has jurisdiction to grant leave, it is only by virtue of section 41 (1) and (3) of the Supreme Court Act of Canada.\nThe proper remedy available to the appellant, who raises the question of validity of a provincial law and of a municipal by-law, is by way of prohibition (C.P. 1003) to restrain the Magistrate from proceeding on the matter, or by way of certiorari (1392-1393), to have the judgment revised. I do not find it necessary to determine whether or not the judgment of Magistrate R\u00e9gnier is that of the highest court of final resort in which judgment can be had in this particular case within the meaning of section 41 of the Supreme Court Act, or if the writs of prohibition and certiorari are procedural or not, as further remedies were available to the appellant (vide Storgoff 2). If the judgment was not that of the highest court in which judgment could be had in this case, this Court has obviously no power to grant leave and if it was, I am of opinion that the remedies afforded where the offence is alleged to have been committed should be resorted to. It is, I think, desirable that we should have the opinions of the highest courts of a province, when a case is submitted to this Court for final determination. The section of the Act authorizing us to grant leave is only permissive, and this is a case, I think, where our discretion may be exercised. I have not overlooked Mr. How's argument that in other cases in the Province of Quebec in which similar by-laws were brought before the courts on motions for prohibition, decisions were rendered adverse to his contention. The judgments to which he referred us were not uniform and it is my view that an application should be made to the Superior Court to obtain a decision on one of the remedies available in this case, before we decide whether or not leave should be granted.\nThe second point raised by the petitioner is that even if the by-law should be held to be valid he does not fall within its scope. Two arguments are submitted on this point. First, that the by-law should be construed so as not to conflict with the Freedom of Worship Act, R.S.Q. 1947, c. 307; and secondly, that the pamphlet in question was a religious pamphlet and that its distribution was part of the exercise of the religious profession of the petitioner, and so expressly allowed to him by the last mentioned Act.\nUnder section 41, para. 3, we may grant leave on a question of law or jurisdiction, but it is clear that the question of law raised must be a question of law alone and not a mixed question of law and fact (The King v. Decary, 3). This second point would arise for determi- nation only in the event of the by-law having been held to be valid and, as, for the reasons set out above, I do not think we should now grant leave on the first point, I do not think we should, at this time, grant leave on the second point. If and when a further application is made to us after the remedies in the province have been resorted to on the first point, it will be necessary to consider whether we have any jurisdiction to grant leave on the second point, or whether its determination must not inevitably depend, in part at least, upon questions of fact.\nThe application should be dismissed.\nMotion for leave to appeal dismissed.\n1 [1945] S.C.R. 526.\n2 [1947] S.C.R. 492.\n3 [1942] S.C.R. 80.\n",

The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: (Locke J. dissenting), that the appeal should be allowed.\nPer Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand, Kellock and Fauteux JJ.\u2014The covenant has no reference to the use or abstention from use of the land.\nPer Kerwin and Taschereau JJ.\u2014It would be an unwarrantable extension of the doctrine expounded in Tulk v. Moxhay, 2 Phil. 774; 41 E.R. 1143, or in subsequent cases, to say that it did.\nPer Rand, Kellock and Fauteux JJ.\u2014By its language the covenant is not directed to the land or some mode of its use but to transfer by act of the purchaser and on its own terms it fails in annexation to the land. On its true terms it is a restraint on alienation. Per Rand, Kellock, Estey and Fauteux JJ The covenant is void for uncertainty; from its language it is impossible to set such limits to the lines of race or blood as would enable a court to say in all cases whether a proposed purchaser is or is not within the ban. Clavering v. Ellison 11 E.R. 282 at 289; Clayton v. Ramdsen, [1943] AC. 320.\nLocke J., dissenting, would have dismissed the appeal on the ground that the application of the equitable principle in Tulk v. Moxhay (1848) 2 Phil. 774, not having been raised before Schroeder J., and the Court of Appeal having in the exercise of its discretion declined to consider the point on that ground, this Court should not interfere in a matter that was one of practice in the Ontario courts. As to the remaining points of law he agreed with the reasons of the Chief Justice of Ontario.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario,[1], affirming the judgment of Schroeder J.,[2], on a motion under s. 3 of The Vendors and Purchasers Act, R.S.O., 1937, c. 168.\nJ.J. Robinette K.C. and W.B. Williston for the appellant Noble.\nJ. Shirley Dennison K.C. and Norman Borins K.C. for the appellant Wolf.\nK.G. Morden K.C. and J.C. Osborne for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by:\nKERWIN J.: This is an appeal against a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 affirming the judgment of Schroeder J.2 on a motion under s. 3 of The Vendors and Purchasers Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 168. That section, so far as relevant, provides that a vendor of real estate may apply in a summary way to the Supreme Court in respect of any requisition or objection arising out of, or connected with, a contract for the sale or purchase of land. The motion was made by the present appellant, Mrs. Noble, as the vendor under a contract for the sale by her to the purchaser, her co-appellant Bernard Wolf, of land forming part of a summer resort development known as the Beach O\u2019Pines. This land had been purchased in 1933 by Mrs. Noble from the Frank S. Salter Company, Limited, and in the deed from it to her appeared the following covenant:\nAnd the Grantee for himself his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, covenants and agrees with the Grantor that he will carry out, comply with and observe, with the intent that they shall run with the lands and shall be binding upon himself, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, and shall be for the benefit of and enforcible by the Grantor and\/or any other person or persons seized or possessed of any part or parts of the lands included in Beach O\u2019Pines Development, the restrictions herein following, which said restrictions shall remain in full force and effect until the first day of August, 1962, and the Grantee for himself, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns further covenants and agrees with the Grantor that he will exact the same covenants with respect to the said restrictions from any and all persons to whom he may in any manner whatsoever dispose of the said lands.\n* * *\n(f) The lands and premises herein described shall never be sold, assigned, transferred, leased, rented or in any manner whatsoever alienated to, and shall never be occupied or used in any manner whatsoever by any person of the Jewish, Hebrew, Semitic, Negro or coloured race or blood, it being the intention and purpose of the Grantor, to restrict the ownership, use, occupation and enjoyment of the said recreational development, including the lands and premises herein described, to persons of the white or Caucasian race not excluded by this clause.\nAlthough the deed was not signed by Mrs. Noble, I assume that she is bound to the same extent as if she had executed it.\nEach conveyance by the Company to a purchaser of land in the development contained a covenant in the same form. The present respondents, being owners of other parcels of land in the development, were served with notice of the application either before Schroeder J. or the Court of Appeal, and they and their counsel affirmed the validity of the covenant, its binding effect upon Mrs. Noble, and that any of the respondents are able to take advantage of the covenant so as to prevent by injunction its breach. While before the judge of first instance the vendor and purchaser apparently took opposite sides, each of them appealed to the Court of Appeal and, there, as well as before this Court, attacked the contentions put forward on behalf of the respondents.\nIn the Courts below emphasis was laid upon the decision of Mackay J. in Re Drummond Wren[3], and it was considered that the motion was confined to the consideration of whether that case, if rightly decided, covered the situation. The motion was for an order declaring that the objection to the covenant made on behalf of the purchaser had been fully answered by the vendor and that the same did not constitute a valid objection to the title or for such further and other order as might seem just. The objection was:\nREQUIRED in view of the fact that the purchaser herein might be considered as being of the Jewish race or blood, we require a release from the restrictions imposed in the said clause (f) and an order declaring that the restrictive covenant set out in the said clause (f) is void and of no effect.\nThe answer by the vendor was that the decision in Re Drummond Wren applied to the facts of the present sale with the result that clause (f) was invalid and the vendor and purchaser were not bound to observe it. In view of the wide terms of the notice of motion, the application is not restricted and it may be determined by a point taken before the Court of Appeal and this Court, if not before Mr. Justice Schroeder.\nThat point depends upon the meaning of the rule laid down in Tulk v. Moxhay[4]. This was a decision of the Lord Chancellor, Lord Cottenham, affirming a decision of the Master of the Rolls. The judgment of the Master of the Rolls appears in 18 L.J.N.S. (Equity) 83, and the judgment of the Lord Chancellor is more fully reported there than in Phillips\u2019 Reports. In the latter, the Lord Chancellor is reported as saying, page 777:\nThat this Court has jurisdiction to enforce a contract between the owner of land and his neighbour purchasing a part of it, that the latter shall either use or abstain from using the land purchased in a particular way, is what I never knew disputed.\nIn the Law Journal, the following appears at p. 87:\nI have no doubt whatever upon the subject; in short, I cannot have a doubt upon it, without impeaching what I have considered as the settled rule of this Court ever since I have known it. That this Court has authority to enforce a contract, which the owner of one piece of land may have entered into with his neighbour, founded, of course, upon good consideration, and valuable consideration, that he will either use or abstain from using his land in any manner that the other party by the contract stipulates shall be followed by the party who enters into the covenant, appears to me the very foundation of the whole of this jurisdiction. It has never, that I know of, been disputed. At p. 88 of the Law Journal, the Lord Chancellor states that the jurisdiction of the Court was not fettered by the question whether the covenant ran with the land or not but that the question was whether a party taking property, the vendor having stipulated in a manner, binding by the law and principles of the Court of Chancery to use it in a particular way will not be permitted to use it in a way diametrically opposite to that which the party has covenanted for. To the same effect is p. 778 of Phillips\u2019s.\nIn view of these statements I am unable to gain any elucidation of the extent of the equitable doctrine from decisions at law such as Congleton v. Pattison[5] and Rogers v. Hosegood[6]. It is true that in the Court of Appeal, at p. 403, Collins L.J., after referring to extracts from the judgment of Sir George Jessel in London & South Western Ry. Co. v. Gomm[7], said at p. 405:\nThese observations, which are just as applicable to the benefit reserved as to the burden imposed, shew that in equity, just as at law, the first point to be determined is whether the covenant or contract in its inception binds the land. If it does, it is then capable of passing with the land to subsequent assignees; if it does not, it is incapable of passing by mere assignment of the land.\nThis, however, leaves untouched the problem as to when a covenant binds the land.\nWhatever the precise delimitation in the rule in Tulk v. Moxhay may be, counsel were unable to refer us to any case where it was applied to a covenant restricting the alienation of land to persons other than those of a certain race. Mr. Denison did refer to three decisions in Ontario: Essex Real Estate v. Holmes[8]; Re Bryers and Morris[9]; Re McDougall v. Waddell[10]; but he was quite correct in stating that they were of no assistance. The holding in the first was merely that the purchaser of the land there in question did not fall within a certain prohibition. In the second an inquiry was directed, without more. In the third, all that was decided was that the provisions of s. 1 of The Racial Discrimination Act, 1944, (Ontario), c. 51 would not be violated by a deed containing a covenant on the part of the purchaser that certain lands or any buildings erected thereon should not at any time be sold to, let to or occupied by any person or persons other than Gentiles (non-semitic (sic)) of European or British or Irish or Scottish racial origin.\nIt was a forward step that the rigour of the common law should be softened by the doctrine expounded in Tulk v. Moxhay but it would be an unwarrantable extension of that doctrine to hold, from anything that was said in that case or in subsequent cases that the covenant here in question has any reference to the use, or abstension from use, of land. Even if decisions upon the common law could be prayed in aid, there are none that go to the extent claimed in the present case.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal. There should be no costs of the original motions in the Supreme Court of Ontario.\nThe judgment of Rand, Kellock and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by:\nRAND J.:\u2014Covenants enforceable under the rule of Tulk v. Moxhay[11], are properly conceived as running with the land in equity and, by reason of their enforceability, as constituting an equitable servitude or burden on the servient land. The essence of such an incident is that it should touch or concern the land as contradistinguished from a collateral effect. In that sense, it is a relation between parcels, annexed to them and, subject to the equitable rule of notice, passing with them both as to benefit and burden in transmissions by operation of law as well as by act of the parties.\nBut by its language, the covenant here is directed not to the land or to some mode of its use, but to transfer by act of the purchaser; its scope does not purport to extend to a transmission by law to a person within the banned class. If, for instance, the grantee married a member of that class, it is not suggested that the ordinary inheritance by a child of the union would be affected. Not only, then, it is not a covenant touching or concerning the land, but by its own terms it fails in annexation to the land. The respondent owners are, therefore, without any right against the proposed vendor. On its true interpretation, the covenant is a restraint on alienation. The grantor company which has disposed of all its holdings in the sub-division has admittedly ceased to carry on business and by force of the provisions of The Companies\u2019 Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 251, s. 28 its powers have become forfeited; but by ss. (4) they may, on such conditions as may be exacted, be revived by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. Assuming the grantor would otherwise be entitled to enforce the covenant in equity against the original covenantor\u2014and if he would not the point falls\u2014it becomes necessary to deal with the question whether for the purposes of specific performance the covenant is unenforceable for uncertainty.\nIt is in these words: (See clause (f) p\u2014?\nThe lands and premises herein described shall never be sold, assigned, transferred, leased, rented or in any manner whatsoever alienated to, and shall never be occupied or used in any manner whatsoever by any person of the Jewish, Hebrew, Semitic, Negro or coloured race or blood, it being the intention and purpose of the Grantor, to restrict the ownership, use, occupation and enjoyment of the said recreational development, including the lands and premises herein described, to persons of white or Caucasian race not excluded by (this clause.\nIf this language were in the form of a condition, the holding in Clayton v. Ramsden[12], would be conclusive against its sufficiency. In that case the House of Lords dealt with a condition in a devise by which the donee became divested if she should marry a person \u201cnot of Jewish parentage and of the Jewish faith\u201d and held it void for uncertainty. I am unable to distinguish the defect in that language from what we have here: it is impossible to set such limits to the lines of race or blood as would enable a court to say in all cases whether a proposed purchaser is or is not within the ban. As put by Lord Cranworth in Clavering v. Ellison[13], at p. 289 the condition \u201cmust be such that the Court can see from the beginning, precisely and distinctly, upon the happening of what event it was that the preceding estate was to determine.\u201d\nThe effect of the covenant, if enforceable, would be to annex a partial inalienability as an equitable incident of the ownership, to nullify an area of proprietary powers. In both cases there is the removal of part of the power to alienate; and I can see no ground of distinction between the certainty required in the one case and that of the other. The uncertainty is, then, fatal to the validity of the covenant before us as a defect of or objection to the title.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and direct judgment to the effect that the covenant is not an objection to the title of the proposed vendor, with costs to the appellants in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.\nESTEY J.:\u2014The appellants Noble as vendor and Wolf as purchaser were negotiating relative to a summer residence in an area known as the Beach O\u2019Pines on Lake Huron. In the course thereof questions were raised as to the validity of clause (f) (hereinafter quoted) in the agreement under which the appellant Noble acquired the premises on the 16th of January, 1933, from the Frank S. Salter Company Limited. The appellant Noble, therefore, brought a motion under the Vendors and Purchasers Act (R.S.O. 1937 c. 168) for an order, inter alia, that the restrictive covenant (clause (f)) did not constitute a valid objection to the title. Mr. Justice Schroeder held the covenant to be valid and his judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThe appellants contend this clause (f) is contrary to public policy, constitutes a restraint upon alienation and is void for uncertainty.\nClause (f) is a subparagraph in the following clause:\nAnd the Grantee for himself, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, covenants and agrees with the Grantor that he will carry out, comply with and observe, with the intent that they shall run with the lands and shall be binding upon himself, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, and shall be for the benefit of and enforceable by the Grantor and\/or any other person or persons seized or possessed of any part or parts of the lands included in Beach O\u2019Pines Development, the restrictions herein following, which said restrictions shall remain in full force and effect until the first day of August, 1962, and the Grantee for himself, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns further covenants and agrees with the Grantor that he will exact the same covenants with respect to the said restrictions from any and all persons to whom he may in any manner whatsoever dispose of the said lands.\n* * *\n(f) The lands and premises herein described shall never be sold, assigned, transferred, leased, rented or in any manner whatsoever alienated to, and shall never be occupied or used in any manner whatsoever by any person) of the Jewish, Hebrew, Semitic, Negro or coloured race or blood, it being the intention and purpose of the Grantor, to restrict the ownership, use, occupation and enjoyment of the said recreational development, including the lands and premises herein described, to persons of the white or Caucasian race not excluded by this clause.\nThis restrictive covenant literally construed would prohibit any person possessing the slightest degree of race or blood specified purchasing any land in this area. So construed it would be necessary to determine whether it constituted such a substantial restraint upon alienation as to make the clause void \u201cas being repugnant to the very conception of ownership.\u201d Cheshire\u2019s Modern Real Property, 5th Ed. p. 528.\nIt is, however, submitted that the parties never intended that the language should be so strictly construed. Once, however, another or more liberal construction be given the issue becomes one of what degree of race or blood would be permitted. As to what degree the contract is silent. A judge, therefore, called upon to determine this issue, finds in the contract no standard or other assistance that would constitute a basis upon which the issue might be determined. His position would be analogous to that of the Earl of Halsbury in Murray v. Dunn[14], where he stated:\nI confess I have been looking in vain for some definite guide as to what is suggested to be the real meaning. Both the learned counsel who have addressed your Lordships have, I think, failed to give any definite meaning to the words.\nIn Sifton v. Sifton[15], the testator provided for certain payments to be made to his daughter subject to a condition subsequent that \u201cthe payments to my said daughter shall be made only so long as she shall continue to reside in Canada.\u201d This was held to be void for uncertainty. It was agreed that the testator did not intend that his daughter should remain absolutely in Canada, but for what period and for what purpose she might remain outside of Canada could not be ascertained from the terms of the will.\nIn Clayton v. Ramsden[16], the testator bequeathed a pecuniary legacy and a share of the residue upon trust for his daughter subject to a condition subsequent that if his daughter \u201cshall at any time after my death contract a marriage with a person who is not of Jewish parentage and of the Jewish faith then * * * all the * * * provisions * * * shall cease and determine * * *\u201d Lord Romer, with whom Lord Atkin and Lord Thankerton agreed, was of the opinion that \u201cJewish parentage,\u201d as used in this will, meant of the Jewish race and that the condition subsequent was void for uncertainty. At p. 333 he stated:\nIt seems far more probable that the testator meant no more than that the husband should be of Hebraic blood. But what degree of Hebraic blood would a permissible husband have to possess? Would it be sufficient if one only of his parents were of Hebraic blood? If not, would it be sufficient if both were? If not, would it be sufficient if, in addition, it were shown that one grandparent was of Hebraic blood or must it be shown that this was true of all his grandparents? Or must the husband trace his Hebraic blood still further back? These are questions to which no answer has been furnished by the testator. It was, therefore, impossible for the court to see from the beginning precisely or distinctly on the happening of what event it was that Mrs. Clayton\u2019s vested interests under the will were to determine, and the condition is void for uncertainty.\nLord Romer\u2019s decision is based upon Clavering v. Ellison[17], where at 725 Lord Cranworth stated:\nthat where a vested estate is to be defeated by a condition on a contingency that is to happen afterwards, that condition must be such that the Court can see from the beginning, precisely and distinctly, upon the happening of what event it was that the preceding vested estate was to determine.\nThe foregoing are cases of conditions subsequent providing for the divesting of vested estates. It is contended that such precise and distinct language is not required in restrictive covenants. On the contrary, both upon principle and authority, the same clarity would appear to be essential.\nRestrictive covenants constitute \u201can equity attached to land by the owner,\u201d Lord Cottenham in Tulk v. Moxhay[18]; and in Hall v. Ewin[19], Lord Lindley states: \u201cThe principle of Tulk v. Moxhay * * * imposes a burden on the land * * *\u201d This burden passes with the land against all but purchasers without notice thereof and parties interested are entitled to ascertain from the covenant the exact nature, character and extent of the restriction. Moreover, these covenants constituting a burden upon the land must, in general, interfere with the right of disposition thereof. Lord Dunedin, in speaking of a condition restricting land, and the same rule of construction would apply to a covenant, stated, in Anderson v. Dickie[20] at 227:\nFar earlier than this it had been held that all conditions restricting the use of land must be very clearly expressed, (the presumption being always for freedom;\nIn Murray v. Dunn[21], a covenant, by way of a servitude, provided that \u201cany building of an unseemly description\u201d should not be erected upon the premises. Lord Kinnear in the First Division of the Court of Session for Scotland delivered a judgment which was approved of in the House of Lords. In the course of his judgment he stated that the bond of servitude \u201cprovides no standard for the specific application of the terms * * *\u201d and at 287:\nSo far as my opinion goes, I cannot say that it is unseemly; the utmost that can be said for the pursuers\u2019 case is that that is a matter of opinion, and if there may be a reasonable difference of opinion as to the specific application of the terms in which a servitude is expressed to the facts of a particular case, it is not a well-defined servitude.\nIn Brown\u2014Covenants Running with Land, at p. 126, the author states:\nA restrictive covenant as to letting or user of property will be construed strictly; the Court will not extend it on the ground of presumed intention.\nSee also Jolly\u2014Restrictive Covenants Affecting Land, at p. 77 and p. 79.\nThese authorities support the view that the language of a restrictive covenant must set forth clearly and distinctly the intent of the parties. The general language in clause (f), with great respect to those learned judges who hold a contrary view, fails to indicate the intention of the parties as to the amount or degree of the prohibited race or blood that might be permitted. It must, therefore, upon the authorities, be held void for uncertainty.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal. There should be no costs of original motion in the Supreme Court of Ontario. LOCKE J. (dissenting):\u2014The proceedings in this matter were initiated by an application made by the appellant Noble to the Supreme Court of Ontario under the provisions of The Vendors and Purchasers Act (R.S.O. 1937, c. 168) and The Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (R.S.O. 1937, c. 152) in the following circumstances. By deed dated January 10th. 1933, the Frank S. Salter Company Limited granted to the said appellant a plot of land situate in a summer resort known as Beach O\u2019Pines in the Township of Bosanquet on the shores of Lake Huron, together with a right-of-way over certain lands described in a deed of land from that company to Beach O\u2019Pines Club Limited, for the purpose of ingress and egress from and to the public highway and the water\u2019s edge of Lake Huron. By the conveyance it was recited, inter alia, that the grantee covenanted for herself, her heirs, executors, administrators and assigns to carry out, comply with and observe, with the intent that they should run with the lands and be binding upon her and upon them and be for the benefit of and enforcible by the grantor and any other persons seized or possessed of lands included in the Beach O\u2019Pines Development, the restrictions thereafter recited which were to remain in force until August 1, 1962, and that she would exact the same covenants with respect to the said restrictions from any person to whom she might dispose of the lands of the various restrictions thereafter recited. The only one with which we are concerned is in a clause lettered (f) and provided that the lands should never be sold, rented or in any manner alienated to and never be occupied or used in any manner by any person of the Jewish, Hebrew, Semitic, Negro or coloured race or blood, it being the declared intention and purpose of the grantor to restrict the ownership, use, occupation and enjoyment of the said recreational development, including the described lands, to persons of the white or Caucasian race. While Mrs. Noble apparently did not execute the conveyance she took possession under it and it is not contended on her behalf that if otherwise enforcible against her she is not bound by its terms.\nBy an offer to purchase dated April 19, 1948, the appellant Bernard Wolf offered to purchase the property from Mrs. Noble and while the fact was not proven it is apparently common ground that this offer was accepted in writing. The proposal stipulated that Wolf should be allowed twenty days from the date of its acceptance to investigate the title and if within that time he should present any valid objection to the title which the vendor should be unwilling or unable to remove, the agreement should terminate. Thereafter, by letter dated the 5th day of May, 1948, the solicitor for Wolf submitted the following requisitions to the solicitor for Mrs. Noble:\nRequired in view of the fact that the purchaser herein might be considered as being of the Jewish race or blood, we require a release from the restrictions imposed in the said clause (f) and an order declaring that the restrictive covenant set out in the said clause (f) is void and of no effect.\nMrs. Noble\u2019s solicitor replied to that requisition by a letter dated May 6, 1948, stating:\nIn our opinion the decision rendered in the case of re Drummond Wren, 1945 Ontario Reports p. 778 applies to the facts of the present sale, with the result that the clause (f) objected to is invalid and the vendor and purchaser are not bound to observe it.\nIn a letter written on the same date the purchaser replied insisting upon an order of the court being obtained in which it would be declared that the said restrictive covenant was \u201cvoid and of no effect.\u201d These proceedings were then initiated by a notice of motion given on behalf of Mrs. Noble:\nfor an order declaring that the objection to the restrictive covenant made in writing on behalf of the purchaser dated the 5th day of May, 1948, has been fully answered by the vendor and that the same does not constitute a valid objection to the title.\nIn view of the subsequent course of these proceedings it is of importance to consider the nature of the material filed on the application and the identity of the persons who were notified of the proceedings and took part in the argument. In support of the motion there was filed an affidavit of one of the solicitors for Mrs. Noble reciting the purchase of the property by her, the registration of the deed, the terms of the requisition made by the solicitor for Wolf, the terms of the subsequent correspondence, and stating that she had been advised by the solicitors from the Beach O\u2019Pines Protective Association that if the sale to Wolf was to be concluded they were instructed to commence proceedings at once to enforce the restriction set out in clause (f). On May 8, 1948, on the joint application of the parties MacKay J. directed that a copy of the notice I of motion to be served on the Beach O\u2019Pines Protective Association and upon the Frank S. Salter Company Limited at least ten days before the hearing of the application. This Association is apparently an unincorporated body formed by some 35 persons owning and occupying property in the Beach O\u2019Pines Development who had associated themselves together for the purpose of improving the property and of safeguarding the rights, privileges and quiet enjoyment of their members. Apparently on its behalf an affidavit of one of its members, James Burgess Book, was filed stating, inter alia, that the community had been developed as a summer recreational area, that the improvements made by the Association and the congeniality of its members had to a large extent improved the value of the lands, and that unless the restrictions and conditions concerning the lands were enforced it was his opinion and that of the Committee of the Association that the character of the community would be changed, with the result that the desirability of the locality as a summer residence for the present owners would be lessened and the value of the lands depreciated. On behalf of Wolf an affidavit of one of his solicitors was filed stating that he had searched the file of the Frank S. Salter Company Limited in the office of the Provincial Secretary at Toronto, that the last named address of Salter was in Detroit and producing what was stated to be a true copy of a statutory declaration made by Salter, said to be filed with the Provincial Secretary dated April 1, 1937, in which it was said, inter alia, that the company had held no meeting of directors or shareholders during the past four years and that \u201cby reason that the company has not used its corporate powers for three and a half consecutive years such powers have become forfeited under section 28 of the Companies Act.\u201d This apparently was intended to be proof of the facts stated in the copy of the declaration. In addition, there was an affidavit showing that all of the conveyances of lands in the development made by the Salter Company contained the same restrictive covenants and conditions as those in the deed to Noble. When the matter came before Mr. Justice Schroeder he considered that a representation order should be made and directed that the interests of other land owners interested but not represented should be represented by six named persons, presumably land holders in the development. Both Noble and Wolf were represented by counsel on the argument. It is clear from the reasons for judgment delivered by Schroeder J. that the only questions argued were that the restrictive covenant was unenforceable as being contrary to public policy, as being void for uncertainty and on the further ground that it was an unlawful attempt to restrain the alienation of property conveyed in fee simple. These issues were those which had been considered and decided by MacKay J. in the Drummond Wren case[22] and these Schroeder J. decided adversely to the contention of the vendor. When the matter came before the Court of Appeal other counsel represented Wolf and a further question of law was raised which had not theretofore been argued or considered. Stated briefly the point is that the covenant contained in clause (f) is neither a covenant which would run with the land and therefore bind Wolf or subsequent owners, nor did it create a negative easement binding upon him or subsequent purchasers from him, whether with or without notice of its existence. The equitable principle, the extent of which is to be decided if the question is before us, is that stated by Lord Cottenham in Tulk v. Moxhay[23]. This question is entirely distinct from the three issues which were submitted for the opinion of Schroeder J. and the Chief Justice of Ontario with whom Aylesworth J.A. agreed, and Hogg J.A. declined to consider it. Henderson and Hope JJ.A. gave written reasons but did not refer to the point, directing their attention to the matters that had been raised before Schroeder J.: I would, however, assume that they also considered the matter should not be dealt with. As the matter comes before us a majority of the court at least, if not all of its members, have declined to consider this point of law upon which the opinion of the learned judge in chambers has not been obtained. Speaking generally, it has not been the practice of this court to interfere with the decisions of courts of appeal in matters of their own procedure. In Toronto Railway v. Balfour[24], the court refused to interfere with a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in a matter of procedure, Taschereau J. saying that the matter was but a question of practice and consequently one with which, in accordance with the jurisprudence, the court would not interfere and referring to O\u2019Donnell v. Beatty[25]; Williams v. Leonard and Sons[26], and Price v. Fraser[27]. In Finnie v. City of Montreal[28], Girouard J. pointed out that in matters of mere procedure when no injustice is shown the court will not interfere with the action of the court below. See also Laing v. Toronto General Trusts[29]. Where, however, a grave injustice has been inflicted upon a party to a suit the court has interfered for the purpose of granting the appropriate relief, though the question may be one of procedure only as in Lamb v. Armstrong[30], and Eastern Townships Bank v. Swan[31]. The question as to whether a court of appeal should hear questions of law not raised in the court below frequently is a difficult one to determine. Some of the objections to permitting the practice are pointed out in the judgment of Lord Finlay L.C. in Banbury v. Bank of Montreal[32], at 661-2. In S.S. \u201cTordenskjold\u201d v. S.S. \u201cEuphemia\u201d[33] at 163, Duff J. as he then was said:\nThe principle upon which a Court of Appeal ought to act when a view of the facts of a case is presented before it which has not been suggested before is stated by Lord Herschell in The \u201cTasmania\u201d,[34] at p. 225, thus:\nMy Lords, I think that a point such as this, not taken at the trial, and presented for the first time in the Court of Appeal, ought to be most jealously scrutinized. The conduct of a cause at the trial is governed by, and the questions asked of the witnesses are directed to, the points then suggested. And it is obvious that no care is exercised in the elucidation of facts not material to them.\nIt appears to me that under these circumstances a court of appeal ought only to decide in favour of an appellant on a ground there put forward for the first time, if it be satisfied beyond doubt, first, that it has before it all the facts bearing upon the new contention, as completely as would have been the case if the controversy had arisen at the trial; and next, that no satisfactory explanation could have been offered by those whose conduct is impugned if an opportunity for explanation had been afforded them when in the witness box.\nThe settlement of the question involves the exercise of a discretion (Banbury v. Bank of Montreal[35],). It is, I think, of importance that when the matter was brought before the Court of Appeal, as noted in the judgment of the Chief Justice of Ontario, there was doubt as to whether the representation order made by Schroeder J. was authorized by the Rules of Court and that 37 additional interested parties were notified of the proceedings so that they might, if they wished, be heard. If under the practice the representation order was not properly made these persons were apparently not represented at the first hearing. Whether if the point now sought to be argued had been raised before Schroeder J. these persons or the six individuals who were then represented by Mr. Morden, K.C. would have considered that further evidence might be given which would affect the determination of the matter, I do not know and I must decline to speculate. The learned judges of the Court of Appeal for Ontario had exercised their discretion and declined to consider the matter and I think we should not interfere with their decision.\nAs to the remaining matters argued so fully before us, I agree with the learned Chief Justice of Ontario.\nIn my opinion this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant (Vendor): Carrothers, McMillan and Egener.\nSolicitors for the appellant (Purchaser): Richmond and Richmond.\nSolicitors for the Respondents: Day, Wilson, Kelly, Martin and Morden.\n[1] [1949] O.R. 503.\n[2] [1948] O.R. 579.\n[3] [1945] O.R. 778.\n[4] (1848) 2 Phil. 774; 41 E.R. 1143.\n[5] (1808) 10 East 130.\n[6] [1900] 2 Ch. 388.\n[7] (1882) 20 Ch.

The order also substituted for Part III of the Western Grain Regulations new Regulations which declared that all oats and barley in commercial positions in Canada, except such as were acquired by the owner from the Canadian Wheat Board or from the producers thereof on or after March 18, 1947, were thereby vested in the Board, which was directed to pay an amount equal to the maximum price at which these grains might have been sold on that date. On April 3, 1947, respondent Nolan had, in commercial positions in Canada, 40,000 bushels of barky, the warehouse receipts for which were held on his behalf by the respondents Hallet and Carey Limited.\nNolan declined to deliver his barley or the documents of title thereto to the Wheat Board and contended that the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, did not authorize the Governor General in Council by enacting Part III of the Western Grain Regulations or otherwise to divest him of title to his barley. The trial judge and the Court of Appeal held that the order-in-council exceeded the powers conferred by the Transitional Act.\nHeld: (Affirming the judgment appealed from) Kerwin and Estey JJ. dissenting, that the provisions of P.C. 1292, dealing with the compulsory taking and vesting in the Canadian Wheat Board of all oats and barley in commercial positions in Canada and fixing the compensation to be paid therefor, were ultra vires of the Governor General in Council as not falling within the ambit of the powers conferred by s. 2 of the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945.\nApart from the fact that the power to appropriate property was not given in the Transitional Act, either in express terms or by plain implication from the language employed in s. 2, the omission of the provisions dealing with the subject contained in the War Measures Act from the Transitional Act, 1945, is a plain indication that it was not intended that the Governor in Council should be vested with any such power.\nChemicals reference [1943] S.C.R. 1; Co-operative Committee on Japanese Canadians v.

As I agree substantially with the reasons delivered by them, I do not deem it necessary or advisable to state my reasons for coming to that conclusion as this would be merely a repetition of what they have already said to my satisfaction.\nKerwin J. (dissenting): These are appeals by the Canadian Wheat Board and the Attorney General of Canada from the judgments of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba 2 affirming judgments of the Chief Justice of the King's Bench in two separate actions dealing in substance with the same matter. While in the pleadings the question was raised that The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, (hereafter called the statute) was ultra vires the Parliament of Canada, we were advised that the point was never argued in the King's Bench or in the Court of Appeal, and certainly no such contention was advanced before us. The matter may therefore be approached on the basis that the statute is intra vires and that the sole question is whether parts of Order in Council P.C. 1292, of April 3, 1947, were within the powers conferred upon the Governor in Council by the statute. The Courts below have answered that question in the negative.\nThe statute came into force January 1, 1946, and section 6 provides that on and after that date the war against Germany and Japan should, for the purposes of the War Measures Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 206, be deemed no longer to exist. It was recognized, however, that chaos would result if all the measures adopted by the Governor in Council under the War Measures Act were abrogated and if no delegation of powers to that body were made. This is shown by the recital in the statute:\nWHEREAS the War Measures Act provides that the Governor in Council may do and authorize such acts and things, and make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he may by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war deem necessary or advisable, for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada; And whereas during the national emergency arising by reason of the war against Germany and Japan measures have been adopted under the War Measures Act for the military requirements and security of Canada and the maintenance of economic stability; And whereas the national emergency arising out of the war has continued since the unconditional surrender of Germany and Japan and is still continuing; And whereas it is essential in the national interest that certain transitional powers continue to be exercisable by the Governor in Council during the continuation of the exceptional conditions brought about by the war and it is preferable that such tran- sitional powers be exercised hereafter under special authority in that behalf conferred by Parliament instead of being exercised under the War Measures Act; And whereas in the existing circumstances it may be necessary that certain acts and things done and authorized and certain orders and regulations made under the War Measures Act be continued in force and that it is essential that the Governor in Council be authorized to do and authorize such further acts and things and make such further orders and regulations as he may deem necessary or advisable by reason of the emergency and for the purpose of the discontinuance, in an orderly manner as the emergency permits, of measures adopted during and by reason of the emergency.\nSubsection 1 of s. 2 provides:\n2. (1) The Governor in Council may do and authorize such acts and things, and make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he may, by reason of the continued existence of the national emergency arising out of the war against Germany and Japan, deem necessary or advisable for the purpose of\n(a) providing for and maintaining the armed forces of Canada during the occupation of enemy territory and demobilization and providing for the rehabilitation of members thereof,\n(b) facilitating the readjustment of industry and commerce to the requirements of the community in time of peace,\n(c) maintaining, controlling and regulating supplies and services, prices, transportation, use and occupation of property, rentals, employment, salaries and wages to ensure economic stability and an orderly transition to conditions of peace;\n(d) assisting the relief of suffering and the restoration and distribution of essential supplies and services in any part of His Majesty's dominions or in foreign countries that are in grave distress as the result of the war; or\n(e) continuing or discontinuing in an orderly manner, as the emergency permits, measures adopted during and by reason of the war.\nThe important clauses are (c) and (e).\nJeremiah J. Nolan is a grain merchant residing in Chicago, Illinois, and is a citizen of the United States. Hallet and Carey Limited is a corporation duly incorporated under the laws of the Dominion of Canada and carries on the business of a grain merchant at Winnipeg, Manitoba. On or about July 31, 1943, that Company, as agents for Nolan, purchased 40,000 bushels of No. 3 C.W. Six-Row Barley and obtained warehouse receipts for it from various warehousemen in Port Arthur\/Fort William, Ontario. From time to time, in accordance with a practice in the grain trade, the barley was loaned by Nolan but was returned to him each time, the last occasions being in December, 1946, and January, 1947. The warehouse receipts in existence at the relevant time are all dated in one or the other of these months. Prior to January 1, 1946, the date of the coming into force of the statute, various steps had been taken to regulate the price and the export of barley, oats and wheat. While we are primarily concerned with barley, its position in the general economy of Canada cannot be isolated from that of the other two products or taken from its setting in the overall picture of Canadian life under the War Measures Act and under the statute. Under the former, the Wartime Prices and Trade Board was constituted, and that Board made regulations to provide safeguards under war conditions against any undue enhancement in the prices of food, fuel and other necessities of life and to insure an adequate supply and equitable distribution of such commodities. The Canadian Wheat Board had already been created by Parliament in 1935 and it was appointed an administrative agency under the Wartime Prices and Trade Board. On March 17, 1947, the Wheat Board issued \"Instructions to Trade No. 59\", addressed \"To all Companies and Dealers in Oats and Barley\". These instructions commenced: \"In accordance with the new Government policy announced in Parliament March 17, 1947, regarding oats and barley (an outline of which is attached), the Board issues the following instructions effective midnight, March 17, 1947.\"\nThe outline of Government policy referred to in this statement and which as indicated was attached thereto, announced that the previous system of advance equalization payments would be discontinued and that the Wheat Board would stand ready to buy all oats and barley offered to it at new support prices, which in the case of barley would be based on 90c for One Feed Barley in place of the former support price of 56c in store Fort William\/Port Arthur, and other grades at appropriate differentials to be fixed from time to time by the Wheat Board. The support prices would remain in effect until July 31, 1948. At the same time price ceilings for all grades would be raised, in the case of barley to 93c and in the case of oats to 65c basis in store Fort William\/Port Arthur or Vancouver. These ceiling prices corresponded with the support prices for the highest grades of barley and oats. In order to avoid discrimination against producers who had already delivered barley during the current crop year, provision was made for an adjustment payment. By paragraph 4 of the outline of Government policy:\n4. In order to avoid the fortuitous profits to commercial holders of oats and barley that would otherwise result from the action that has been described, handlers and dealers will be required to sell to the Wheat Board on the basis of existing ceilings of 64\u00bec. per bushel for barley and 51\u00bdc. per bushel for oats, all stocks in their possession at midnight tonight, March 17. Under certain conditions these stocks will be returned to the holder for resale. Allowances will be made for the purpose of taking care of such items as carrying charges in terminal positions, special selection premiums, etc., which are considered in the judgment of the Board fair and reasonable.\nFor the time being, because of the continuation of price ceilings on animal products, subsidies were provided for all oats and barley within the same conditions as a payment already authorized on wheat purchased for feed purposes, and it was stated that the payment of these subsidies would have the effect of leaving the cost of these feed grains to the feeder approximately at their present levels. The Wheat Board would become the sole exporter of oats and barley and any exports by the Board would be from grain acquired by it under the price support plan and the net profits therefrom would be paid into Equalization Accounts for the benefit of producers for distribution. It was pointed out that producers would have an additional return on their oats and barley, in addition to which they would continue to receive any net profits realized by the Board as an additional payment at the end of the season. On the other hand, feeders would be protected against any important increase in costs of the oats and barley.\nReverting now to the instructions to the trade, these followed the outline of Government policy in all important respects and, while it may be said that so far no authority for any action by the Wheat Board existed, this was remedied by the Order in Council 1292 passed April 3, 1947. It recited:\nWHEREAS it is necessary, by reason of the continued existence of the national emergency arising out of the war against Germany and Japan, for the purpose of maintaining, controlling and regulating supplies and prices to ensure economic stability and an orderly transition to conditions of peace, to make provision for\n(a) the vesting in the Canadian Wheat Board of all oats and barley in commercial positions in Canada and products of oats and barley in Canada; (b) the closing out and termination of any open futures contracts relating to oats or barley outstanding in any futures market in Canada; and\n(c) the prohibition of the export of oats or barley by persons other than the Canadian Wheat Board until otherwise provided; and other matters incidental thereto as set forth in the Regulations set out below;\nThe Governor General in Council, under the powers conferred by the statute, amended the existing Western Grain Regulations by substituting a new Part III. While both oats and barley are dealt with by the Order in Council, it will be sufficient from this time on to refer particularly to barley. By the new Part III barley means barley grown in a designated area, and barley in commercial positions means barley which was not the property of the producer and was in store in warehouses, elevators or mills, etc. (It should be here interpolated that it is common ground that the barley in question in these actions came from a designated area as defined in an earlier part of the Western Grain Regulations and that it was in commercial positions). All barley in commercial positions, except such as was acquired by the owner from the Wheat Board or from the producer thereof, on or after March 18, 1947, was vested in the Wheat Board, which was directed to pay a person who was the owner at midnight on March 17, 1947, an amount equal to the previous maximum price, subject to adjustment and storage or handling charges, etc. Other provisions are included to take care of cases other than those similar to that of Nolan. The Board was directed to sell and dispose of all barley vested in it at such prices as it might consider reasonable. Net profits arising from such operations were to be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund.\nWhile it is said on behalf of Nolan that there was no possibility of loss, the Order in Council provided that the Board should be reimbursed in respect of any net losses arising from its operations in respect of barley vested in it out of moneys provided by Parliament. Additional clauses provided that there should be no export of barley except by the Wheat Board or with its permission.\nNolan was directed to deliver his barley and the documents of title thereto to the Wheat Board but declined, and the two actions followed. Since the Governor in Council deemed it necessary or advisable by reason of the continued existence of the national emergency arising out of the war against Germany and Japan to promulgate P.C. 1292, for the purpose of maintaining, controlling and regulating supplies (s. 2, subsection 1(c) of the statute) and for the purpose of continuing or discontinuing in an orderly manner as the emergency permits, measures adopted during and by reason of the war (s. 2, subsection 1(e) of the statute), I am of opinion that looking only at the statute, the powers conferred by subsection 1 of s. 2 were sufficient to authorize what was done. Taking the words in their ordinary and natural meaning, they include a power to appropriate barley (inter alia) and pay the price fixed by the Governor in Council. The action taken was in the opinion of the Governor in Council, necessary or advisable and it is not for the judiciary to question that decision; Fort Frances Pulp and Power Co. v. Manitoba Free Press Co.3; Co-operative Committee on Japanese Canadians v. Attorney General of Canada 4.\nBut it is said that a power to appropriate and fix compensation could never have been contemplated by Parliament if one looks at the provisions of the War Measures Act, which had been superseded by the statute. Under s. 3 of the former appears clause (f) \"Appropriation, control, forfeiture and disposition of property and of the use thereof\"; and by s. 7, whenever any property or the use thereof has been appropriated and compensation is to be made therefor and has not been agreed upon, the claim is to be referred by the Minister of Justice to a named Court or a judge thereof. It was pointed out that in the Chemicals Reference 5, it was decided that paragraph 4 of the Order in Council there under consideration was in conflict with section 7 of the War Measures Act as it provided for a method of fixing compensation other than that specified in section 7.\nThat was an entirely different case. In the statute here under consideration, the recital states that it is essential that the Governor in Council be authorized to do and authorize such further acts and things and make such further orders and regulations as he may deem necessary or advisable by reason of the emergency and for the purpose of the discontinuance in an orderly manner as the emergency permits, of measures adopted during and by reason of the emergency. In view of this, I find it impossible to read the words of subsection 1 of s. 2 and particularly clauses (c) and (e) as withholding from the Governor in Council the power to appropriate barley and pay the price fixed by him. The fortuitous profits envisaged by the Government policy actually emerged in Nolan's case and the means adopted to capture them were within the powers conferred by the statute.\nThe appeals should be allowed and the judgments of the Court of Appeal and King's Bench set aside. Under an order of December 7, 1948, the barley was sold and the proceeds paid into Court. By another order of February 1, 1949, there were paid out of these proceeds the charges of the warehousemen, parties to the action brought by the Wheat Board, which warehousemen were by the same order, on consent dropped from the proceedings. According to the orders of the Court of Appeal of March 10, 1949, disposing of the appeals in the two actions, there was in Court the sum of $38,454.70 and accrued interest. Of this amount Nolan would be entitled, at the most, to $25,900 (being 64\u00bec per bushel for 40,000 bushels of barley), and accrued interest from the date of the payment into Court. The Wheat Board is entitled to the balance with accrued interest.\nThe action by Nolan against Hallet and Carey Limited is dismissed with costs, payable by him to the Company. Upon motion by the Attorney General of Canada, he was added as a party defendant in that action by an order of the Chief Justice of the King's Bench, dated October 15, 1948, and was thereby ordered to pay the costs of the other parties of and incidental to the motion. The Attorney General is entitled to his costs since that date as against Nolan, including the costs of the appeals to the Court of Appeal and to this Court. Since Hallet and Carey Limited were acting as agents for Nolan, they are entitled to their costs of those appeals against him. The Wheat Board is entitled as against Nolan to its costs of its action against him and Hallet and Carey Limited and of the appeals to the Court of Appeal and this Court. Hallet and Carey Limited are entitled as against Nolan to their costs of that action and of the appeals to the Court of Appeal and to this Court. They are also entitled as against Nolan to the amounts proper to be paid them by him for interest and storage.\nAll of the appropriate costs above referred to shall be taxed without regard to the limit fixed by s. 31 of the Manitoba Court of Appeal Act or by King's Bench Rule No. 630. All the costs and the interest and storage charges directed to be paid by Nolan may be paid out of his share of the money in Court. If there is any difficulty in working out the order, the matter may be spoken to.\nTaschereau J.:\u2014The main question that has to be decided, and which is sufficient to dispose of these two appeals, may be briefly stated as follows: \"Does P.C. 1292 of April 3, 1947, fall within the ambit of the powers conferred by Section 2(1) (c) of the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act? (9-10 Geo. VI c. 25).\"\nThis Order-in-Council made provision for the vesting in the Canadian Wheat Board of all oats and barley in commercial positions in Canada, and determined what compensation the Board should pay to the owners. The relevant section of the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, which it is submitted on behalf of the appellant, purports to give the necessary powers to the Governor in Council to enact P.C. 1292, reads as follows:\n2. (1) The Governor in Council may do and authorize such acts and things, and make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he may, by reason of the continued existence of the national emergency arising out of the war against Germany and Japan, deem recessary or advisable for the purpose of\n(c) maintaining, controlling and regulating supplies and services, prices, transportation, use and occupation of property, rentals, employment, salaries and wages to ensure economic stability and an orderly transition to conditions of peace;\nThe validity0 of the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act has not been challenged before this Court, but it is submitted that the words \"maintain\", \"control\" and \"regulate\", are not wide enough to authorize the compulsory transfer of property to the Wheat Board, and the ex parte fixing of compensation to be paid.\nThere can be no doubt that under the War Measures Act, which ceased to be in force in Canada on the 1st of January, 1946, much wider powers were conferred upon the Governor in Council. For instance, section 3(f) of the War Measures Act read as follows:\n3. The Governor in Council may do and authorize such acts and things, and make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he may by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada; and for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms, it is hereby declared that the powers of the Governor in Council shall extend to all matters coming within the classes of subjects hereinafter enumerated, that is to say:\n(f) Appropriation, control, forfeiture and disposition of property and of the use thereof.\nThe power to appropriate and dispose of property was clearly given to the Governor in Council, and it was further provided in section 7 of the Act that:\n7. Whenever any property or the use thereof has been appropriated by His Majesty under the provisions of this Act, or any order in council, order or regulation made thereunder, and compensation is to be made therefor and has not been agreed upon, the claim shall be referred by the Minister of Justice to the Exchequer Court, or to a superior or county court of the province within which the claim arises, or to a judge of any such court. 1914 (2nd session), c. 2, s. 7.\nIt is because this clause was in conflict with section 4 of the Order-in-Council, authorizing the controller of chemicals in certain cases to determine the compensation payable for chemicals of which he had taken possession, that it was held by this Court, that such a power could not be exercised. (In Re Chemicals 6).\nThese powers to appropriate property which were given to the Governor in Council by the War Measures Act, have been deleted from the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, and I think that it is fair to assume that it was the clear intention of Parliament, that such powers would not exist in the future. The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act is to my mind without doubt a clear curtailment of the powers that the Governor in Council could validly exercise during the war under the War Measures Act. As Estey J. said in the Japanese Reference 7, in regard to the Transitional Powers Act:\nParliament did recognize that the intensity and magnitude of the emergency had changed and diminished, and under the provisions of this Act curtailed the extensive powers exercised by the Governor in Council under the War Measures Act.\nThis statement is quite in harmony with the preamble of the Act which, by section 14 of the Interpretation Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 1), is deemed a part of the Act, intended to assist in explaining the purport and object of the Act. The preamble states that it is essential in the national interest that certain transitional powers continue to be exercisable by the Governor in Council; that in the existing circumstances certain orders and regulations made under the War Measures Act be continued in force, and that it is also essential that the Governor in Council be authorized to do and authorize such further acts and things and make such further orders and regulations as he may deem necessary or advisable by reason of the emergency and for the purpose of the discontinuance, in an orderly manner as the emergency permits, of measures adopted during and by reason of the emergency. Section 2(1) (c) above quoted, which authorizes the Governor General to make from time to time orders and regulations as he may deem necessary or advisable, for the purpose of maintaining, controlling, and regulating prices to ensure economic stability and an orderly transition to conditions of peace, show as well as the preamble, the clear intention of Parliament to curtail the extensive powers that the Governor General in Council exercised during the war under the War Measures Act.\nFurthermore, the War Measures Act gave general powers to pass regulations deemed necessary or advisable, \"for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada\"; and \"for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms\", it is declared that the powers of the Governor in Council shall extend to certain matters specifically enumerated, among which the appropriation and forfeiture of property. Despite the generality of the terms of the War Measures Act, Parliament thought it necessary to deal specifically with appropriation and forfeiture of property. The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act does not contain the words \"for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada\" nor \"for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms\", so that it seems clear that the powers of the Governor General are limited to subsections (a), (b), (c) and (d) of section 2. The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act is enacted for five purposes and it is consequently in one of these purposes that the power to appropriate and fix compensation must be found.\nI cannot find in this section 2 any words, general or specific, that can lead me to the conclusion that maintain, control and regulate, include compulsory taking and fixing the compensation to be paid. If it had been the intention of Parliament to give such a wide power to the Governor General in Council, this power would have been specifically mentioned, as it has been in the War Measures Act, or it would be found in the opening words of the section. It would surely not have been deleted as it has been in the statute now under consideration.\nThe War Measures Act is a general Act but the new Act is limited in its purposes, and cannot be extended. As Chief Justice Sir Charles Fitzpatrick said in the Gray case 8:\nParliament cannot indeed, abdicate its functions, but within reasonable limits at any rate it can delegate its powers to the Executive Government. Such powers must necessarily be subject to the termination at any time by Parliament, and needless to say the acts of the Executive, under its delegated authority, must fall within the ambit of the legislative pronouncement by which its authority is measured.\nI have therefore reached the conclusion that under the guise of maintaining, controlling and regulating prices, the Governor General in Council cannot compulsorily appropriate property and arbitrarily fix the compensation to be paid. The exercise of such powers would be beyond the authority conferred by statute.\nFor these reasons, I think that the provisions of P.C. 1292, dealing with the compulsory taking and vesting in the Canadian Wheat Board of all oats and barley in commercial positions in Canada, and fixing the compensation to be paid, are ultra vires of the Governor in Council.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs. Rand J.:\u2014This appeal challenges the power of the Dominion Government by order-in-council under the Transitional Powers Act of 1945 to appropriate barley in commercial elevator storage or in transit at Fort William and western points on March 17, 1947 not owned by producers or by malsters or manufacturers of pot and pearl barley at the then existing controlled price of 64\u00bec a bushel. On the following day, March 18, the price was raised to 93c and in October of the same year the control was removed. The open price in the United States during this period was considerably higher than in this country, and upon the release in October the price on the Grain Exchange at Winnipeg led off at over $1.20. The barley here in question was sold in October, 1948, at the price of $1.24. Although by the order-in-council all barley vested in the Wheat Board, the latter offered it back to the former owners at the new price of 93c, and in all cases apparently except that of the respondent the offer was accepted. The result of this was that the increase permitted by the operation of the control was appropriated by the Government, leaving the benefit of any subsequent uncontrolled increase, such as actually took place in October, 1947, to the owner.\nThe Transitional Powers Act retained to the Governor in Council certain of the powers exercised under the War Measures Act; the latter, subject to such limitations as are contained in the Act itself and in the British North America Act, and except such acts as could not be deemed by the Governor in Council in good faith to be relevant to war, cover virtually the entire legislative field of both the Dominion and the Provinces. The reason is obvious: the political and social existence of the country is at stake; that interest rises above all distribution of legislative jurisdiction, and the fundamental duty of preservation is cast upon Parliament, by which those powers have been entrusted to the Executive.\nUnder the War Measures Act, the purposes of the powers granted were the \"security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada\" including trade, production, and the appropriation, control, forfeiture and disposition of property and the use of it; and the acts, things, orders and regulations authorized to be done or made were such as the Governor in Council should deem \"necessary or advisable\" to effect those ends. The corresponding objects of the Transitional Powers Act were specifically enumerated, and those relevant to this controversy are:\n(c) maintaining, controlling and regulating supplies and services, prices, transportation, use and occupation of property, rentals, employment, salaries and wages to ensure economic stability and an orderly transition to conditions of peace;\n* * *\n(e) continuing or discontinuing in an orderly manner, as the emergency permits, measures adopted during and by reason of the war;\nand the Governor in Council was empowered likewise to do whatever, for such purposes, he deemed \"necessary or advisable.\"\nThe aftermath of war presents abnormal conditions which similarly are of national interest and concern and which likewise transcend the ordinary plane of legislation; but they are of lessened scope and somewhat changed in character. Parliament, therefore, passed the Act of 1945 as a truncated War Measures Act in which the jurisdiction enjoyed by the Executive under the former Act was reduced. As these continued powers are in the nature of a residue from the previous investment, we may properly look at both statutes to ascertain precisely the extent of authority continued.\nThe appropriation of property of individuals was specifically mentioned as a power conferred in item (f) of section 3 of the War Measures Act; and section 7, in the absence of agreement, submits the ascertainment of compensation to the courts.\nIt is significant, then, that neither the latter provision nor mention of appropriation or forfeiture appears in the later statute: and neither, in the same sense, can, in my opinion, be implied. There is also the specific mention of the \"use and occupation of property\" as distinguished from the \"appropriation, control, forfeiture and disposition\" of property. I find no evidence of an intention to enlarge any power continued beyond its scope under the former statute, and it would be inconsistent with the declared purpose of Parliament to imply in the continued authority what was express in the original enactment. The appropriation of property for which the statutory compensation was provided means, I think, the absolute appropriation of the beneficial interest, for objects of the Government with which the individual has no private concern. But appropriation as a device for effecting an object validly incidental to price control presents a different question.\nThe object here, specifically set forth in the instructions to the trade issued by the Wheat Board on April 7, 1947 and by the declaration of Government policy in Parliament, was to capture the profit \"fortuitously\", as it was stated, resulting from the increase of price directly effected by the order. The appropriation or limitation of profit so arising was not a new incident in fact in price control; the requirement that authorized increases in price should not apply to existing stocks was a matter of common knowledge; the method followed here had been authorized by order-in-council No. P.C. 3223 in force from 1939 to at least 1947, in relation to sugar; order-in-council No. P.C. 7942, issued October 12, 1943 brought about a regulation of wheat of the most drastic sort: except with the permission of the Wheat Board, no person could buy wheat from a producer for resale; the Board could require any person to offer wheat owned by him for sale to any other person on terms prescribed by the Board; all futures contracts were voided; and any surplus resulting from the exclusive dealings in this grain by the Board went into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. These measures were well known to Parliament. The function of neither the Wheat Board nor the Sugar Controller was to acquire property as an immediate object in itself; it was to administer the commodity in the broadest sense as part of the total regulation of the country's economy in which equality of incidence was a working principle; and the decision of the Government that control of or elimination of other than actual service profit, as distinguished from capital profit, was \"necessary or advisable,\" and the selection of the mode by which that was to be effected, as for instance by way of a charge, possessory or not, were, I think, clearly within the powers of price control committed to it under the War Measures Act: The Japanese Reference 9. Price control was continued under the Transitional Act in the broadest terms; and as the subsidiary object of profit limitation was a recognized measure in the total regulation, and the device of vesting title a known means of accomplishing it, in the absence of some indication to the contrary in the Transitional Act both should be taken to be continued: to change principles in bringing controls to a conclusion would give legitimate grounds for protest from those to whom they had been applied in the heat of the day. What, then, is the effect upon either or both of them of the omissions in the Transitional Act of the powers mentioned?\nAs a striking illustration of a circumstance frequently met, the conclusion on that question depends upon the extent to which the background facts are taken into account. If we look at the acquisition of the grain as an isolated act, detached from its context, it does seem to bear the countenance of a despotic exercise of power over which individualists may Wax lyrical and which Parliament cannot be taken to have intended to confer; but if we envisage it in the body of the economic life of Canada, regulated in varying degrees from 1939 to the present time, the transaction becomes in reality a minor item of a vast, complex and consistent administration, of which, as observed, the operative principles incorporated in the earlier stages ought to be, and certainly could be, carried through to the end. It was under that control that Nolan was able to buy the barley in 1943 at the price he did; and who can say what the conditions in the trade would have been without it? What is complained against is the law of Parliament and the policy of government; but to the total interests of the Dominion in such an emergency and its aftermath that of the individual must be subordinated: and so long as he is dealt with on the basis of a rationally justifiable principle, he has no ground to object on moral, much less, legal considerations.\nSet against the price increase and the appropriation of profit, and as elements in the body of regulation, were the increase of 10c in the subsidy to producers and the subsidy of 25c to stock owners of feed in the East. That producers and consumers should be specially dealt with, even at the expense, by restriction, of the respondent's normal activity of profit making, was obviously a matter of governmental policy; and it would be, out of the question for any court, except at least in a case of demonstrated bad faith, to attempt to substitute its judgment for that of the Executive. For that reason I get no assistance from the evidence led to show the conditions of the barley trade: those conditions were only a part of the wider objects and concerns of the Government. When Parliament enables the Executive to take such measures for the purposes mentioned as it may \"deem necessary or advisable,\" an endowment of legislative power which is here admitted to be valid, it will require more convincing reasons than have been addressed to us to satisfy me that the Government, in so acting, has exceeded the authority conferred upon it or has been guilty of misrepresenting its purpose.\nThe capture of the so-called profit, was, in my opinion, a legitimate measure in price control; but whether it could be achieved by the device of appropriating title is a question which I find unnecessary to answer because I am unable to construe the appropriation under the order-in-council to be limited to that purpose. The position of the Crown is that title was taken absolutely and that there was no obligation on the Crown to do more than to pay the maximum price then established, 64\u00bec a bushel: such a step is not, in my opinion, authorized by the Transitional Act and was ultra vires of the Governor in Council.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nEstey J. (dissenting):\u2014The Canadian Wheat Board claims 40,000 bushels of barley and the warehouse receipts covering same by virtue of para. 22 of Part III of the Western Grain Regulations as enacted by Order-in-Council P.C. 1292 passed the third day of April, 1947, pursuant to the provisions of the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945 (S. of C. 1945, c. 25). Para. 22 reads as follows:\n22. All oats and barley in commercial positions in Canada, except such oats and barley as were acquired by the owner thereof from the Canadian Wheat Board or from the producers thereof on or after the eighteenth day of March, nineteen hundred and forty-seven, are hereby vested in the Canadian Wheat Board. The issue in this appeal turns upon the respondent's contention that this paragraph is invalid because Parliament, under the N.E.T.P. Act, 1945, did not confer powers upon the Governor in Council to enact it.\nThe barley in question was the property of J. J. Nolan. On July 31, 1943, Hallet & Carey Ltd., acting as agents for J. J. Nolan, purchased 40,000 bushels of barley and obtained the warehouse receipts covering same. Nolan never disposed of this 40,000 bushels of barley and as owner held it under warehouse receipts on April 3, 1947.\nThe price of barley, along with other commodities under the circumstances of the war, was fixed on November 1, 1941. Thereafter floor and ceiling prices were fixed and export prohibited except by permit. On March 17, 1947, the Government announced in Parliament certain changes in its policy with respect to oats and barley. On the same date and pursuant to that policy the Canadian Wheat Board issued Instructions to Trade No. 59 and attached thereto a copy of the statement of policy. These instructions and the attached statement of policy were sent to all members of the trade.\nThe relevant portions of these instructions are that they became effective midnight March 17, 1947; advance equalization payments were discontinued; support prices were fixed on the basis of No. 1 feed Canada Western barley 90c per bushel, basis Fort William; the maximum price of barley grown in Western Canada was raised to 93c per bushel, basis Fort William; and the export of barley was prohibited except by the Canadian Wheat Board. It also provided for an adjustment payment of 10c per bushel on barley delivered and sold between August 1, 1946, and March 17, 1947, to producers within the \"designated area\" (briefly defined as western grain growing areas). In para. 5 of these instructions it was provided:\nAll western oats and barley in commercial channels in Canada as at midnight March 17, 1947, must be sold to the Canadian Wheat Board basis 51\u00bdc per bushel for all grades of oats and 64\u00bec per bushel for all grades of barley in store Fort William\/Port Arthur or Vancouver.\nIn the foregoing para. 5 the phrase \"commercial channels\" is used, while in Order-in-Council P.C. 1292, para. 22, the phrase \"commercial positions\" is used. Nothing turns upon this difference in terminology and both may be briefly defined as oats and barley not the property of the producer in storage or transit (Part III, sec. 21(c) Western Grain Regulations as enacted by Order-in-Council P.C. 1292).\nThe policy announced by the Government contained the following:\nIn order to avoid the fortuitous profits to commercial holders of oats and barley that would otherwise result from the action that has been described, handlers and dealers will be required to sell to the Wheat Board on the basis of existing ceilings of 64\u00bec per bushel for barley and 51\u00bdc per bushel for oats, all stocks in their possession at midnight tonight, March 17. Under certain conditions these stocks will be returned to the holder for resale. Allowances will be made for the purpose of taking care of such items as carrying charges in terminal positions, special selection premiums, etc. which are considered in the judgment of the Board fair and reasonable.\nand it further stated:\nthe Government to continue to pay freight on grain for feeding purposes and millfeeds shipped East from Fort William\/Port Arthur and West from Calgary and Edmonton into British Columbia until July 31, 1948.\nThe essentials relative to this discussion are that the maximum price was raised to 93c per bushel, except that the price of barley in commercial positions would remain at 64\u00bec per bushel and must be sold to the Wheat Board; that, though the price was increased to the producer by appropriate subsidies, those purchasing barley for feeding purposes were \"protected against any important increase in costs \u2026 of barley.\"\nInstructions to Trade No. 59 were generally ignored by holders of oats and barley in commercial positions with the result that oats and barley so held remained in commercial positions and unsold, while the authorities believed that at least a very large portion thereof was necessary for feeding purposes and, therefore, should have been made available in the market.\nIn these circumstances the Governor in Council was fully justified in taking such steps as he deemed necessary or advisable within the limits of the powers conferred upon him by the N.E.T.P. Act, 1945. He deemed it necessary or advisable to enact Order-in-Council P.C. 1292 under sec. 2(1) of the latter Act.\n2. (1) The Governor in Council may do and authorize such acts and things, and make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he may, by reason of the continued existence of the national emergency arising out of the war against Germany and Japan, deem necessary or advisable for the purpose of\n* * *\n(c) maintaining, controlling and regulating supplies and services, prices, transportation, use and occupation of property, rentals, employment, salaries and wages to ensure economic stability and an orderly transition to conditions of peace;\nThe preamble of the N.E.T.P. Act, 1945 recites that the War Measures Act provided wide powers to be exercised by the Governor in Council by reason of the existence of the war; that the national emergency arising out of the war still continues and that certain transitional powers should, in the national interest, be continued in the Governor in Council and that \"it is preferable that such transitional powers be exercised hereafter under special authority,\" then, after reciting that certain orders and regulations made under the War Measures Act should be continued, it recites:\nthat it is essential that the Governor in Council be authorized to do and authorize such further acts and things and make such further orders and regulations as he may deem necessary or advisable by reason of the emergency and for the purpose of the discontinuance, in an orderly manner as the emergency permits, of measures adopted during and by reason of the emergency.\nThe opening words of sec. 2(1) of the N.E.T.P. Act above quoted are identical with the opening words of sec. 3 of the War Measures Act and read:\nThe Governor in Council may do and authorize such acts and things, and make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he may, by reason of \u2026\nThe foregoing provision was described by Anglin J. (later C.J.) in a judgment concurred in by Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Sir Louis Davis J. (later C.J.): \"More comprehensive language it would be difficult to find.\" (In Re Gray 10). In the same case Duff J. (later C.J.) at 166 stated:\nThe words \u2026\u2026\u2026. are comprehensive enough to confer authority for the duration of the war to make orders and regulations covering any subject falling within the legislative jurisdiction of Parliament, subject only to the condition that the Governor in Council shall deem such orders and regulations to be, by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, \u2026\u2026\u2026 advisable. In the Chemicals Reference 11 Rinfret J. (now C.J.) at p. 17 stated:\nThe powers conferred upon the Governor in Council by the War Measures Act constitute a law-making authority, an authority to pass legislative enactments such as should be deemed necessary and advisable by reason of war; and, when acting within those limits, the Governor in Council is vested with plenary powers of legislation as large and of the same nature as those of Parliament itself.\nThe foregoing emphasizes the very wide and comprehensive powers conferred upon the Governor in Council by sec. 3 of the War Measures Act. In determining the intent of Parliament in re-enacting the identical language in sec. 2 of the N.E.T.P. Act, 1945 regard must be had for the provisions of sec. 21(4) of the Interpretation Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 1):\n21. 4. Parliament shall not, by re-enacting any Act or enactment, or by revising, consolidating or amending the same, be deemed to have adopted the construction which has, by judicial decision or otherwise, been placed upon the language used in such Act, or upon similar language.\nAt common law the re-enactment of a legislative provision already judicially construed raised a presumption that the Legislature adopted that judicial construction. Broom's Legal Maxims, p. 395. The enactment of sec. 21(4) did away with that presumption. Thereafter the identical provision, when re-enacted, remained to be construed by the courts without the assistance of the presumption. Even without that presumption, however, the courts have shown a disposition to conclude that Parliament, having re-enacted the words with knowledge of the judicial construction, in fact, intended that such should be adopted. In The Canadian Pacific Railway v. Albin 12, sec. 155 of the Railway Act (R.S.C. 1906, c. 37) was under consideration. That section, in identical language, was first enacted by Parliament as sec. 92 of the Statute of 1888, had been re-enacted in 1903 and continued in the revision of 1906. Mr. Justice Anglin (later C.J.), with whom the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Mignault agreed, after pointing out that sec. 21(4) of the Interpretation Act has been in force since 1890 (53 Vict., c. 7, sec. 1), continued:\nWe cannot assume that the Dominion Legislature when they re-enacted the clause verbatim (in 1903 and again in 1906) were in ignorance of the judicial interpretation which it had received. It must on the contrary be assumed that they understood that (s. 92 of the Act of 1888) must have been acted upon in the light of that interpretation. Casgrain v. Atlantic and North West Ry. Co. (1), at page 300. It is unreasonable to suppose that if Parliament were not satisfied that its intention had been thereby given effect to it would have re-enacted the section in the same terms.\nIn Rex v. Adkin 13, Chief Justice Sloan, with whom Smith J.A. agreed, stated, in construing sec. 750(a) of the Criminal Code at p. 1025:\nHowever, it seems to me it is a fair inference notwithstanding said sec. 21(4) that if the construction put upon sec. 750(a) by the cases decided prior to 1938 was contrary to the intention of Parliament apt language would have been used in the 1938 re-enactment of the section to effectuate its original purpose.\nBoth the War Measures Act and the N.E.T.P. Act, 1945 were enacted to deal with an emergency. That provided for in the War Measures Act is \"the existence of real or apprehended war \u2026,\" while under the N.E.T.P. Act, 1945 it is \"the continued existence of the national emergency arising out of the war.\" The latter was never an emergency so wide or great in its scope.\nIt is not suggested that under the War Measures Act the Governor in Council did not possess by virtue of the identical language legislative power to appropriate or vest commodities. It is, however, contended that though Parliament adopted this identical language, it has evidenced an intention that it should not be construed to the same effect. The provisions of the Statute do not appear to support such a contention. That Parliament recognized the narrower or more restricted scope of the emergency and the possibility of its continuing to diminish is very evident. In these circumstances what Parliament did was to restrict the exercise of the powers conferred upon the Governor in Council to matters specified under sub-paragraphs (a) to (e) inclusive of sec. 2. Parliament, however, could not anticipate all the circumstances with regard to which legislative measures might be necessary to effect the ends and purposes specified in these sub-paragraphs and, therefore, conferred upon the Governor in Council the same wide and comprehensive powers for the attain- ment of these specific purposes as it had conferred upon the Governor in Council for the attainment of the more general purposes set out in the War Measures Act.\nIt is particularly contended that the omission of any specified method for the determination of compensation for appropriated or vested property as was contained in sec. 7 of the War Measures Act discloses an intention on the part of Parliament that the Governor in Council should not possess the power to appropriate or vest. That Parliament did realize the necessity for appropriation of property on any such scale as during hostilities no longer existed must be conceded. Parliament does not, however, evidence any intention that it might not be sometimes necessary in dealing with the more restricted fields. The mere omission of such a provision is not sufficient to support a conclusion that Parliament intended the identical language so long and so recently construed to include appropriation should here be differently construed and does not rebut the prima facie intention that Parliament intended that the same construction should be adopted. Indeed it may well be that Parliament did not carry forward into the N.E.T.P. Act any such provision as in sec. 7 of the War Measures Act in order that the very difficulty encountered in the Chemicals Reference (supra) might be avoided. There an Order-in-Council specifying the method of determining compensation was declared to be contrary to sec. 7 of the War Measures Act and, therefore, invalid as beyond the powers conferred upon the Governor in Council. Without such a provision the Governor in Council might provide for the determination of compensation in any manner that he might deem appropriate to the particular circumstances he was called upon to deal with. That is, in effect, the position which now exists under the N.E.T.P. Act. In this particular case there was no question of compensation. The Wartime Prices and Trade Board had fixed it and there was no suggestion that that price should not be paid.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the action of the plaintiff Nolan should be dismissed with costs throughout and the action of the Canadian Wheat Board allowed throughout with costs and judgment directed that the Canadian Wheat Board is entitled to the barley in question and to the documents of title in respect to same.\nLocke J.:\u2014On April 3, 1947, the respondent Nolan was the owner of 40,000 bushels of No. 3 C.W. Six Row Barley which was then in store with various warehousemen at the head of the Lakes and in respect of which they had issued their warehouse receipts. These were then held by the respondents Hallet and Carey, Limited, on his behalf.\nOn that date His Excellency the Governor General in Council, assuming to act under the powers conferred by the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, adopted Order-in-Council P.C. 1292 which recited that by reason of the continued existence of the national emergency arising out of the war against Germany and Japan \"for the purpose of maintaining, controlling and regulating supplies and prices, to ensure economic stability and an orderly transition to conditions of peace\" it was necessary, inter alia, to make provision for the vesting in the Canadian Wheat Board of all oats and barley in commercial positions in Canada, the closing out and termination of any open futures contracts relating to such grain outstanding in any futures market in Canada and the prohibition of its export. By this Order Part III of the Western Grain Regulations which had been put into effect by P.C. 3222 of July 31, 1946, was revoked and new Regulations substituted which, in so far as they are relevant to the first question to be considered, declared that all oats and barley in commercial positions in Canada, except such as were acquired by the owner from the Canadian Wheat Board or from the producers thereof on or after March 18, 1947, were thereby vested in the Board. Nolan's barley was in \"commercial positions\" in Canada, as that expression was defined by the Order: he had acquired the grain in the year 1943 and, by the terms of the Order, the Board was required to pay to him for it the sum of 64\u00be cents per bushel basis in store Fort William or Port Arthur. This was the maximum price at which barley might have been sold on March 17, 1947, under existing Wartime Prices and Trade Board Regulations. The Board was required to buy all oats and barley offered for sale thereafter from time to time at an increased floor price, which in the case of barley was 90 cents for No. 1 feed. The maximum prices had been fixed by the Wheat Board acting under the authority of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board and acting upon the same authority the former Board had on March 17, 1947, in advance of the making of the Order-in-Council, issued instructions to the trade addressed to all dealers in oats and barley increasing that maximum price to 93 cents for barley.\nOn March 17, when these instructions to the trade were issued by the Board, and on April 3, when the Order-in-Council was made, these maximum prices for barley were very much less than that at which barley was quoted on the Minneapolis and Chicago Grain Exchanges and of the price for which it could have been sold were it not for the continuing price control in Canada. The effect of the Order-in-Council, if lawfully made, was to deprive Nolan of the profit he could have at once realized by selling at the new ceiling prices or, if he elected to hold his grain, of the much larger gain he could have made when price control of barley in Canada was terminated in the following October.\nIt is contended for the respondent Nolan that the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, did not authorize the Governor General in Council by enacting Part III of the Western Grain Regulations or otherwise to divest him of title to his barley and, if this contention be right, the other issues raised in this matter which have been so fully argued before us need not be considered.\nBy the War Measures Act, 1914, far reaching powers were vested in the Governor in Council, the exercise of which of necessity would trespass upon the legislative fields assigned to the provinces by section 92 of the British North America Act. The validity of that legislation has long since been determined, and the respondents did not contend in the argument addressed to us in the present case that the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, or the amending statute of 1946 were ultra vires. The War Measures Act, by section 3, authorizes the Governor in Council to do and exercise such acts and things and make such orders and regulations:\nas he may by reason of the existence of real and apprehended war, invasion or insurrection deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada.\nThe interests of the residents of all of the provinces, the interference with whose property and civil rights was thus authorized, were safeguarded by the terms of section 7 of the statute providing that whenever any property or the use thereof has been appropriated by His Majesty under the provisions of the Act or any Order-in-Council, order or regulation made under it and compensation is to be made therefor, the amount, in the absence of agreement, shall be referred by the Minister of Justice to the Exchequer Court or a Superior Court or County Court of the Province within which the claim arises, or to a judge of any such court.\nThe National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, came into force on January 1, 1946, as of which date the war against Germany and Japan for the purposes of the War Measures Act was declared no longer to exist. The preamble to this Act, after stating that during the national emergency arising by reason of the war measures had been adopted under the War Measures Act for the military requirements and security of Canada and the maintenance of economic stability, that the emergency so arising still continued, that it was essential in the national interest that certain transitional powers should continue to be exercisable by the Governor in Council during the continuation of the exceptional conditions brought about by the war, recites that:\nWhereas in the existing circumstances it may be necessary that certain acts and things done and authorized and certain orders and regulations made under the War Measures Act be continued in force and that it is essential that the Governor in Council be authorized to do and authorize such further acts and things and make such further orders and regulations as he may deem necessary or advisable by reason of the emergency and for the purpose of the discontinuance in an orderly manner, as the emergency permits, of measures adopted during and by reason of the emergency. Under the heading \"Powers of Governor in Council\" section 2(1) provides:\nThe Governor in Council may do and authorize such acts and things, and make from time to time such orders and regulations as he may, by reason of the continued existence of the national emergency arising out of the war against Germany and Japan, deem necessary or advisable\nfor certain defined purposes. The language quoted is an adaptation of the opening phrase of section 3 of the War Measures Act with a significant change. In the latter statute the word \"advisable\" is followed by these words:\nfor the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada; and for greater certainty but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms it is hereby declared that the powers of the Governor in Council shall extend to all matters coming within the classes of subjects hereinafter enumerated.\nwhich do not appear in section 2(1) or elsewhere in the Transitional Powers Act. The power of \"appropriation, forfeiture and disposition of property\" given by subsection (f) of section 3 of the War Measures Act and the method of determining the compensation to be paid to persons whose property had been appropriated by His Majesty under the provisions of that Act are also absent.\nThe purposes for which the powers vested in the Governor in Council by the Transitional Powers Act might be exercised are defined by subsection 1 of section 2. Of these, only subsections (c) and (e) appear relevant to the matter under consideration. These read:\n(c) maintaining, controlling and regulating supplies and services, prices, transportation, use and occupation of property, rentals, employment, salaries and wages to ensure economic stability and an orderly transition to conditions of peace;\n(e) continuing or discontinuing in an orderly manner, as the emergency permits, measures adopted during and by reason of the war.\nThis language may be contrasted with that of the comparable section of the War Measures Act where the text, by the use of the words \"but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms\", indicates that the powers to be exercised are not restricted to the defined purposes.\nFrom very early times a petition of right lay when the property of a subject had been converted to the King's use. The history of such proceedings is given in the judg- ment of Erle, C.J. in Tobin v. The Queen 14. In Feather v. The Queen 15, Cockburn C.J., delivering the judgment of the Court of Exchequer said that the only case in which the petition of right was open to the subject was where the lands or goods or money of the subject had found their way into the possession of the Crown and the purpose of the petition was to obtain restitution or, if restitution could no be made, compensation in money. Statutes are not to be construed as taking away or authorizing the taking away of the property rights of the subject, unless their language makes that intention abundantly clear. In Western County Railway Company v. Windsor and Annapolis Railway Company 16, where it was contended that the rights of the respondents under an existing agreement to operate the Windsor Branch Railway had been extinguished by an Act of the Parliament of Canada (37 Vict. c. 16), Lord Watson in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee said (p. 188):\nNeither in the Act 37 Vict. c. 16, nor in the schedules appended to it, is mention made of the agreement of the 22nd of September, 1871, or indeed of any right or interest of the respondent company in the Windsor Branch Railway. The canon of construction applicable to such a statute is that it must not be deemed to take away or extinguish the right of the respondent company, unless it appear, by express words, or by plain implication, that it was the intention of the Legislature to do so. That principle was affirmed in Barrington's case (8 Rep. 138a), and was recognized in the recent case of The River Wear Commissioners v. Adamson (2 A.C. 743). The enunciation of the principle is, no doubt, much easier than its application. Thus far, however, the law appears to be plain\u2014 that in order to take away the right it is not sufficient to shew that the thing sanctioned by the Act, if done, will of sheer physical necessity put an end to the right, it must also be shewn that the Legislature have authorized the thing to be done at all events, and irrespective of its possible interference with existing rights.\nIn Attorney General v. Horner 17, (affirmed 18), Brett, M.R. said in part (p. 256):\nIt was, however, urged, and very strongly, on the part of the plaintiff, that the result of the Paving Acts of Geo. 3 was to interfere with and take away the rights of the owner of the market franchise. Now it is to be observed that if those Acts have taken away and interfered with such rights they have done so without giving any compensation, and it seems to me that it is a proper rule of construction not to construe an Act of Parliament as interfering with or injuring persons' rights without compensation, unless one is obliged to so construe it. If it is clear and obvious that Parliament has so ordered, and there is no other way of construing the words of the Act, then one is bound to so construe them, but if one can give a reasonable construction to the words without producing such an effect, to my mind one ought to do so.\nThe rule is stated to the same effect by Slesser, L.J. in Consett Iron Company v. Clavering 19. In Maxwell on Statutes, 9th Ed. 290, the effect of the authorities appears to me to be accurately summarized.\nThis principle was held clearly in mind when the War Measures Act was first enacted in 1914. No doubt, any question of ultra vires aside, a sovereign Parliament or Legislature in Canada may appropriate to His Majesty's use without compensation property within its legislative jurisdiction. That nothing of this kind was intended when any such property was appropriated, disposed of, or made use of, under the extraordinary powers vested in the Governor in Council under the War Measures Act was made clear by section 7 of that statute with its provision that the quantum of compensation should be determined by the courts. In Nolan's case what was attempted was the outright expropriation of his property with the consequent loss above mentioned in return for what was shown to be wholly inadequate compensation. The power to appropriate property was not expressly vested in the Governor in Council by the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, and the question is as to whether such power is to be implied from the language employed in section 2. If such power is to be implied, then it was not merely a power to appropriate property to His Majesty's use but to do so, if His Excellency the Governor in Council saw fit, without compensation. The fact that partial compensation for the barley to be taken was directed by the terms of the Order-in-Council is aside from the point, since the question is the proper construction of the statute. While the price of barley had been controlled for several years during the war under Wartime Prices and Trade Board Regulations, the commodity had not been appropriated, so that it cannot be said that the Order-in-Council fell within subsection (e) of section 2(1). To the contention that the appropriation was a step taken in \"maintaining, controlling and regulating supplies and prices to ensure economic stability and an orderly transition to conditions of peace\" within subsection (c), the conclusive answer is, in my opinion, that if, as essential to the exercise of those powers or any of them, it was necessary to trespass upon the property and civil rights of the subject by appropriating his property, either with or without recompense, Parliament would no doubt have vested in the Governor in Council the power to do so in express terms and that it has not done so. Apart from the fact that no such power is given, either in terms or by plain implication, the omission of the provisions dealing with the subject contained in the War Measures Act from the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, is a plain indication that it was not intended that the Governor in Council should be vested with any such power.\nSince this is decisive of the matter, I express no opinion on the other questions which were argued before us. I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nCartwright J.:\u2014The facts of this case are fully stated in the reasons of other members of the Court and need not be repeated.\nI propose to deal with one only of the several questions argued before us; that is as to whether or not those provisions of P.C. 1292 of 3rd April 1947 which purported to vest in the Canadian Wheat Board the barley which was Nolan's property and to fix the compensation to be paid to him therefor were intra vires of His Excellency, the Governor General in Council.\nThe order in question purports to be made under the powers conferred by the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945. The validity of that Act was not questioned before us and it is upon its proper construction that the solution of the question under consideration depends.\nMr. Varcoe's able argument satisfies me that the Court cannot say that the Governor in Council did not deem the enactment of P.C. 1292 necessary or advisable for the purposes set out in clauses (c) and (e) of subsection (1) of section 2 of the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act. Assuming then that the order was made for an authorized purpose, it remains to be considered whether the statute conferred the power to make it. The words relied upon as conferring the power are the opening words of section 2(1):\nThe Governor in Council may do and authorize such acts and things, and make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he may, by reason of the continued existence of the national emergency arising out of the war against Germany and Japan, deem necessary or advisable for the purpose of.\nIt will be observed at once that these words are so wide and general that, if they alone are considered, they would seem to give power to the Governor in Council to enact any order which would be within the competence of Parliament itself provided it is enacted for one or more of the specified purposes.\nIt is, I think, well settled that words so general must be construed with caution. \"Verba generalia restringuntur ad habilitatem rei vel personae\" (Bac. Mac. Reg. 10; Broom's Legal Maxims 10th Edition 438).\nIn Cox v. Hakes 20, Lord Halsbury says:\nFrom these and similar examples a canon of construction has been arrived at which has often been quoted but which is so important with reference to the question now before your Lordships that I quote it once again:\nFrom which cases it appears that the sages of the law heretofore have construed statutes quite contrary to the letter in some appearance and those statutes which comprehend all things in the letter, they have expounded to extend but to some things, and those which generally prohibit all people from doing such an act, they have interpreted to permit some people to do it, and those which include every person in the letter they have adjudged to reach to some persons only, which expositions have always been founded on the intent of the Legislature, which they have collected sometimes by considering the cause and necessity of making the Act, sometimes by comparing one part of the Act with another, and sometimes by foreign circumstances. So that they have ever been guided by the intent of the Legislature, which they have always taken according to the necessity of the matter and according to that which is consonant to reason and good discretion.\nSee Stradling v. Morgan 21.\nI am in agreement with the statement in Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes (9th Edition 1946) at page 63:\nIt is in the interpretation of general words and phrases that the principle of strictly adapting the meaning to the particular subject-matter with reference to which the words are used finds its most frequent application. However wide in the abstract, they are more or less elastic, and admit of restriction or expansion to suit the subject-matter. While expressing truly enough all that the Legislature intended, they frequently express more, in their literal meaning and natural force; and it is necessary to give them the meaning which best suits the scope and object of the statute without extending to ground foreign to the intention. It is, therefore, a canon of interpretation that all words, if they be general and not express and precise, are to be restricted to the fitness of the matter. They are to be construed as particular if the intention be particular; that is, they must be understood as used with reference to the subject-matter in the mind of the Legislature, and limited to it.\nBy section 14 of the Interpretation Act (R.S.C. 1927 c. 1) it is provided:\nThe preamble of every Act shall be deemed a part thereof, intended to assist in explaining the purport and object of the Act. R.S., c. 1, s. 14.\nQuite apart from this statutory provision it has long been held that the preamble may be regarded as part of the statute \"for the purpose of explaining, restraining or even extending enacting words, but not for the purpose of qualifying or limiting express provisions couched in clear and unambiguous terms\" (vide Halsbury's Laws of England 2nd Edition Vol 31 page 461 section 558, and cases there cited). The preamble to the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act reads as follows:\nWHEREAS the War Measures Act provides that the Governor in Council may do and authorize such acts and things, and make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he may by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada; and whereas during the national emergency arising by reason of the war against Germany and Japan measures have been adopted under the War Measures Act for the military requirements and security of Canada and the maintenance of economic stability; and whereas the national emergency arising out of the war has continued since the unconditional surrender of Germany and Japan and is still continuing; and whereas it is essential in the national interest that certain transitional powers continue to be exercisable by the Governor in Council during the continuation of the exceptional conditions brought about by the war and it is preferable that such transitional powers be exercised hereafter under special authority in, that behalf conferred by Parliament instead of being exercised under the War Measures Act; and whereas in the existing circumstances it may be necessary that certain acts and things done and authorized and certain orders and regulations made under the War Measures Act be continued in force and that it is essential that the Governor in Council be authorized to do and authorize such further acts and things and make such further orders and regulations as he may deem necessary or advisable by reason of the emergency and for the purpose of the discontinuance, in an orderly manner as the emergency permits, of measures adopted during and by reason of the emergency.\nThe War Measures Act and the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act are in pari materia and the com- parison of their terms is a proper aid in the construction of the latter statute. When the two statutes are read together and due consideration is given to the preamble to the latter, it appears to me that, at the time of passing the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, Parliament envisaged a gradual and orderly discontinuance of the measures which had been enacted by the Governor General in Council during the emergency arising by reason of the war and an immediate reduction of the powers which during that emergency had been delegated to the executive.\nIt will be observed that section 3 of the War Measures Act expressly declares, albeit for greater certainty only, that the powers of the Governor in Council shall extend to all matters coming within certain enumerated classes of subjects of which one is \"(f) appropriation, control, forfeiture and disposition of property and of the use thereof.\" The exercise of this express power is however subject to the terms of section 7 of the Act reading as follows:\nWhenever any property or the use thereof has been appropriated by His Majesty under the provisions of this Act, or any order in council, order or regulation made thereunder, and compensation is to be made therefor and has not been agreed upon, the claim shall be referred by the Minister of Justice to the Exchequer Court, or to a superior or county court of the province within which the claim arises, or to a judge of any such court.\nIt was held by this Court in the Chemicals Reference case 22 that section 4 of the order in council there under consideration, providing that if the controller took possession of any chemicals (as by other sections of the order he was empowered to do) the compensation to be paid in respect thereof should be such as was prescribed and determined by the controller with the approval of the Minister, was ultra vires of the Governor in Council as conflicting with section 7 of the War Measures Act quoted above.\nThe National Emergency Transitional Powers Act makes no express reference to appropriation of property and contains no provision similar to section 7 of the War Measures Act. The appellant cannot succeed unless the general words of the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act are construed as delegating to the Governor in Council a wider power than was conferred upon him under the War Measures Act, that is to say power not only to take over property but to fix the compensation to be paid therefor. I cannot think that such a construction would be in accord with the intention of Parliament. Had Parliament wished to confer upon the executive by the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act a power more sweeping than it had seen fit to delegate in the midst of actual war it appears to me that it would have used express words declaring that intention.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the provisions of P.C. 1292 which purported to vest the title to Nolan's barley in the Board and to fix the compensation to be paid to him were ultra vires of the Governor in Council.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: F.
