Eastern Woodworkers Ltd., [1962] S.C.R. 160\nDate: 1962-01-23\nThe Attorney General of Canada (Plaintiff);\nand\nLaminated Structures & Holdings Limited (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nEastern Woodworkers Limited (Defendant) Respondent;\nand\nTimber Structures of Canada Limited (Defendant).\n1961: October 31; November 1, 2; 1962: January 23.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Locke, Cartwright, Abbott and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA IN BANCO\nContracts\u2014Contract for supply of materials\u2014Disclosure of purpose for which materials required\u2014Reliance of purchaser on skill and judgment of supplier\u2014Implied condition as to fitness of materials\u2014Liability of supplier.\nThe defendant E Ltd. entered into a contract with a Crown agency for the construction of a maintenance and storage garage for the Department of National Defence. The original specifications contemplated the use of steel framework, but shortly after they were issued an alternative of laminated wood frame was authorized. L Ltd. offered to supply E Ltd. with laminated wood trusses for the project. The latter company, as the result of instructions from a second Crown agency specifying T Ltd. as the supplier, gave permission to L Ltd. to place an order for structural wood frame components with that firm, for whom L Ltd. were distributors. A few days after the building was completed and accepted by the Crown engineers, a partial collapse of the roof occurred. In an action brought by the Attorney General of Canada, the trial judge held that E Ltd. was liable for damages to government vehicles caused by the collapse, and held further that E Ltd. could recover the cost of these damages and the cost to it of re-erecting the collapsed structure from L Ltd. The latter's appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco was dismissed, and an appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe question of the reliance of E Ltd. on the skill and judgment of the appellant was a question of fact which had been decided by the judges below, who were of the unanimous opinion that E Ltd. had placed such reliance on the appellant and that there were no circumstances such as to exclude the condition as to fitness of the materials which was implied by law. There was a clear preponderance of evidence to support the finding that \u0395 Ltd. disclosed to L Ltd. the purpose for which the wooden frame and component parts were required; that it effectively disclosed to L Ltd. the reliance placed u\u03c1\u03bfn it; and that the cause of the collapse was within the area of that reliance. Neither the requirement of conformity to the plans and specifications nor the part played by \u03a4 Ltd. operated to exclude such reliance or furnish proof that the reliance was placed on the latter company and not upon L Ltd.

Silica Gel Corporation (1928), 33 Com. Cas. 195; Mash and Murrell, Ltd. v. Joseph I Emanuel, Ltd., [1961] 1 All E.R. 485, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco1, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Ilsley C.J. Appeal dismissed.\nDonald McInnes, Q.C., J. H. Dickey, Q.C., and A. J. Campbell, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nJ. W. E. Mingo and D. R. Chipman, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc1 dismissing the appeal of the present appellant from a judgment of Ilsley C.J. which ordered that the Attorney General of Canada recover the sum of $7,539.21 from the respondent in respect of damage to Government vehicles caused by the partial collapse of the roof of a building constructed by the respondent as general contractor, and which ordered further that the respondent have judgment against the appellant, as the supplier of the defective material which caused the collapse of the said roof, for the said sum, and also for the sum of $66,973.02 being the cost to the respondent of re-erecting the collapsed structure under the terms of its contract with the Crown.\nNeither the Attorney General of Canada nor Timber Structures of Canada Limited is a party to this appeal, and the issue is confined to the question of whether or not the appellant is liable to the respondent either in contract or in tort for the damage sustained by the respondent as a result of the collapse of this roof which has been found to have been occasioned by the incorporation in its structure of a defective laminated wood truss negligently constructed by Timber Structures of Canada Limited and, therefore, not reasonably fit for the purpose for which it was used or required to be used.\nThe essence of the dispute insofar as constractual liability is concerned is that the respondent contends, as the courts below have found, that it was entitled to rely and did rely on the skill and judgment of the appellant from whom it ordered the laminated wood trusses and that the appellant was accordingly in breach of an implied condition that these materials would be reasonably fit for the purpose for which they were required.\nIt is contended on behalf of the appellant on the other hand that the circumstances are such as to exclude the existence of any such condition and that as it was ordered by the respondent to obtain and incorporate in the structure the very trusses which proved to be defective, it was merely carrying out instructions under conditions which gave rise to no warranty or condition except that it would order and obtain the laminated wood products from the makers designated by the respondent and indeed by the Government, namely, Timber Structures of Canada Limited.\nOn December 4, 1951, Defence Construction Limited, a Crown agency, called for tenders for the construction of a maintenance and storage garage at Shearwater, Nova Scotia, for the Department of National Defence. The original specifications contemplated the use of steel framework, but shortly after they were issued an alternative of laminated wood frame was authorized, and on December 13, before any tender had been made by the respondent, it received a telegram from the appellant which was then called \"Laminated Structures Limited\" and of which the respondent had never previously heard which read as follows:\nRE COMBINED MAINTENANCE AND STORAGE GARAGE HMCS SHEARWATER OUR GLUED LAMINATED WOOD TRUSSES HAVE BEEN APPROVED AS ALTERNATE \u0392 IN THE SPECIFICATIONS PLEASE ADVISE IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN QUOTING USING LAMINATED TRUSSES WE WILL LET YOU HAVE PRICE AND OTHER NECESSARY DETAILS (The italics are mine.) On the following day the appellant wrote to the respondent, enclosing a brochure which bore on it the name of \"Timber Structures of Canada Limited\", and saying:\nEnclosed herewith, please find our illustrated brochure entitled: \"ENGINEERED TIMBERS\" and the truss that we propose to supply for the Combined Maintenance and Storage Building for HMCS Shearwater at Dartmouth, N.S., is shown on the last page of the brochure.\nI have also outlined in blue pencil, the arrangement of the trusses where the two buildings are joined together.\nWe will quote on the supply of suitable Timber Columns Timber Side Wall Girts, the necessary Glued Laminated Timflat Trusses and the necessary purlins.\nFor your information we have been in touch with the Navy Engineers at Ottawa, and for their purposes, 2\" \u03a4 & G roofing is classified as a mill roof.\nI regret that our quotation is not yet finalized, but I will have the necessary information for you Monday, December 17, and will be in touch with you by telephone.\nI will, at that time, also give you an approximate estimate of the number of men hours required to assemble and erect the trusses for your guidance. (The italics are mine.)\nOn December 19 the appellant forwarded its tender to the respondent quoting a price and containing the assurance that \"all materials are precut and prefabricated ready for assembly and erection with the exception of the roof sheeting.\" On the following day sketch plans showing the design of a bow string truss were forwarded by the appellant to the respondent, and it is of some importance to note that these plans also bore the name of \"Timber Structures of Canada Limited\".\nOn February 14, 1952, at the request of one of the Crown agencies, Mr. E. C. Mingo of the respondent company came to Ottawa for a discussion with the Engineer-in-Charge of the Navy Defence Research Board concerning various aspects of the contract, but Mr. Mingo was not qualified to talk about the truss himself and he agreed to bring a representative of the subtrade to Ottawa. He tried to get in touch with Mr. Millar of the appellant company who was not available, and he was, accordingly, referred to Mr. DeGrace of Timber Structures of Canada Limited who eventually came to Ottawa to discuss the laminated wood features of the contract and in fact offered to redesign the truss to conform with a suggestion made by the Navy, and when he had done this forwarded his preliminary drawings of the redesigned truss direct to the Government representative. It was not until March 18 that the respondent's tender was accepted, and almost immediately thereafter the respondent wrote to the appellant in part as follows:\nAs there has been a redesign of the type of truss to be used on the above building and we had started negotiations with yourself on prices, etc. on the building, and along the line Timber Structures of Canada have entered the picture submitting a design on a truss for approval by the Navy, would you kindly advise what relation, if any, is there between the above mentioned Companies; namely, Laminated Structures Limited and Timber Structures of Canada Ltd.\nto which the appellant replied:\nYou ask in your letter what is the connection between Timber Structures and ourselves, and I would like to point out that we are the distributors in Eastern Canada for Timber Structures of Canada Limited.\nWithin a few days of writing this letter, Mr. Millar of the appellant company telephoned to the Engineer-in-Charge of the Navy Defence Research Board and it is apparent that as a result of this call the Engineer-in-Charge despatched the following telegram to Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation at Halifax:\nRE GARAGE SHEARWATER JOB 1700 PLEASE REQUEST EASTERN WOODWORKERS TO PLACE ORDER WITH TIMBER STRUCTURES FOR STRUCTURAL WOOD FRAME COMPONENTS STOP ORDER TO BE CONTINGENT ON APPROVAL OF SHOP DRAWINGS BY DND STOP TIMBER STRUCTURES PREPARED TO PROCEED ON THIS BASIS\nInstead of placing the order direct with Timber Structures of Canada Limited, the respondent telegraphed to the appellant as follows:\nINSTRUCTIONS RECEIVED TODAY FROM CM & HC HALIFAX RE MAINTENANCE AND STORAGE GARAGE SHEARWATER N.S. STOP THIS IS YOUR PERMISSION TO PLACE ORDER WITH TIMBER STRUCTURES FOR STRUCTURAL WOOD FRAME COMPONENTS ORDER TO BE CONTINGENT ON APPROVAL OF SHOP DRAWING BY DND STOP OUR FIRM ORDER FOLLOWING.\nThe firm order followed on March 29 and it was acknowledged by the appellant on March 31. The Timber Structures of Canada Limited plans for the frame building were finally approved by the Navy in December 1952, but the building was not completed and accepted by the Crown engineers until January 20, 1954, and eleven days later the collapse occurred. As Doull J. has said in the course of his reasons for judgment in this case:\nThere is ample authority for the proposition that the liability of a contractor for the supplying of material and the erection of a structure is no less than that of a vendor under the Sale of Goods Act.\nThe relevant provision of the Nova Scotia Sale of Goods Act, R.S.N.S. 1954, c. 256, s. 16(a) reads as follows:\n16. Subject to this Act, and any statute in that behalf, there is no implied warranty or condition as to the quality or fitness, for any particular purpose, of goods supplied under a contract of sale, except as follows:\n(a) where the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required, so as to show that the buyer relies on the seller's skill or judgment and the goods are of a description which it is in the course of the seller's business to supply (whether he be the manufacturer or not) there is an implied condition that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose;\u2026.\nThe leading sale of goods cases dealing with the topic of reliance by buyers upon the skill and judgment of the sellers have recently been the subject of a comprehensive review by Martland J., speaking on behalf of this Court in Hayes, Trustee of Preload Co. of Canada Ltd. v. City of Regina2, where the decisions in Manchester Liners, Ltd. v. Rea, Ltd.3, Medway Oil & Storage Co. v. Silica Gel Corpotion4, and Cammell Laird & Co., Ltd. v. Manganese Bronze & Brass Co., Ltd.5 are all fully discussed.\nIn Medway Oil & Storage Co. v. Silica Gel Corporation, supra, Lord Sumner pointed out at p. 196 that although the warranty of fitness is an implied one, it is still contractual, and he went on to say:\n\u2026 just as a seller may refuse to contract except on the terms of an express exclusion of it, so he cannot be supposed to assent to the liability, which it involves, unless the buyer's reliance on him, on which it rests, is shewn and shewn to him. The Tribunal must decide whether the circumstances brought to his knowledge shewed this to him as a reasonable man or not, but there must be evidence to bring it home to his mind, before the case for the warranty can be launched against him.\nIt is, however, now established that if the special purpose for which the goods are required is disclosed to the seller, this circumstance alone may raise the presumption that the buyer is relying on the skill and judgment of the seller. As was said by Martland J. in the Preload Co. of Canada Ltd. case, supra, at p. 820:\nManchester Liners Ltd. v. Rea Ltd. \u2026 held that, if goods are ordered for a special purpose and that purpose is disclosed to the vendor so that, in accepting the contract, he undertakes to supply goods which are suitable for the object required, such a contract is sufficient to establish that the buyer has shown that he relies on the seller's skill and judgment. The mere disclosure of the purpose may amount to sufficient evidence of reliance on the skill and judgment of the seller.\nThe same proposition was recently restated by Diplock J. in Mash and Murrell, Ltd. v. Joseph I. Emanuel, Ltd.6, where he said:\nCounsel for the plaintiffs, in those circumstances, relied on the well-known case of Manchester Liners, Ltd. v. Rea, Ltd. which he says, I think rightly, establishes the proposition that if the particular purpose is made known by the buyer to the seller, then, unless there is something in effect to rebut the presumption, that in itself is sufficient to raise the presumption that the buyer relies on the skill and judgment of the seller;\nMr. McInnes, in the course of his most forceful argument on behalf of the appellant, contended that the appellant's role in supplying the laminated wood trusses was simply that of a selling agent for Timber Structures of Canada Limited and that the evidence in support of this contention was such as to rebut any presumption of reliance which might otherwise arise out of the knowledge on the appellant's part that the laminated wood frame was being ordered for the purpose of the erection of the structure required by the Crown. Going back to the beginning of the matter, Mr. McInnes pointed out, inter alia, that there was a strong probability that the change in the original specifications so as to include laminated wood frame as an alternative to steel was expressly made for the benefit of Timber Structures of Canada Limited, that the changed design of the trusses was discussed and determined by the Crown authorities directly with the representative of Timber Structures of Canada Limited, that on the eve of the granting of the respondent's order to the appellant there was a firm request from a Crown agency specifying Timber Structures of Canada Limited as the supplier, and that on March 27, 1952, the respondent disclosed its understanding of the matter when it said in the concluding paragraph of its letter to the Regional Construction Engineer of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation:\nWe placed an order for the structural frame on the above building with Timber Structures of Canada, today, (through the Montreal Office\u2014 Laminated Structures Ltd.) as per your wire of this date.\nIn support of this argument, great reliance was placed on the last sentence of the following paragraph which appears in Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 3 at p. 435:\nA person who contracts to do work and supply materials warrants that the materials which he uses will be of good quality and reasonably fit for the purpose for which he is using them unless the circumstances of the contract are such as to exclude any such warranty. The contractor, however, cannot be held responsible for the quality of materials or work chosen or directed by the employer or his architect, or in any case where the employer does not rely on the contractor's skill and judgment, as when the employer chooses to supersede the contractor's judgment by using his own.\nIn applying this statement to the present circumstances, Mr. McInnes contended that laminated wood trusses as constructed by Timber Structures of Canada Limited were the materials chosen by the Crown authorities and, therefore, by the respondent for incorporation in the roof structure of the building in question and that the appellant was in effect directed to obtain these materials.\nBy way of illustrating the proposition stated in Halsbury's Laws of England, supra, reference was made to the judgment of Mr. Justice DuParcq in Myers & Co. v. Brent Cross Service Co.7, where he said at p. 55:\nI think that the true view is that a person contracting to do work and supply materials warrants that the materials which he uses will be good quality and reasonably fit for the purpose for which he is using them, unless the circumstances of the contract are such as to exclude any such warranty.\nThere may be circumstances which would clearly exclude it. A man goes to a repairer and says: \"Repair my car; get the parts from the makers of the car and fit them\". In such a case, it is made plain that the person ordering the repairs is not relying upon any warranty except that the parts used will be parts ordered and obtained from the makers.\nOn the other hand, Mr. Wynn Werninck says that it has been, or it can be established, that expressly or impliedly the Defendants were instructed to get parts from the makers, or their recognized agents, and to use those parts, not using their own skill and judgment in the matter at all. If that be so, then I think those facts did afford a Defence, because they did negative any warranty.\nIn assessing the degree to which these statements of the law can be said to govern the facts in the present case, it is to be remembered that the existence of the warranty of fitness is not dependent upon exclusive reliance being placed in the seller's skill and judgment, but that it is sufficient if the reliance be such as to constitute a substantial and effective inducement which leads the buyer to agree to purchase the commodity.\nAlthough there are many factors indicating that the Crown authorities depended on the advice of representatives of Timber Structures of Canada Limited, it nevertheless seems to me that the position adopted by the appellant at the very inception of its association with the respondent invited reliance upon its skill and judgment, and that the subsequent events disclosed by the evidence did not have the effect of materially changing this position. It is to be remembered that when tenders were called for this contract the respondent was totally unfamiliar with glued laminated wood trusses and had never heard of the respondent or of Timber Structures of Canada Limited. On December 13, before it tendered on the contract, it received the appellant's telegram introducing itself as one whose \"glued laminated wood trusses had been approved as Alternate B in the specifications\" and that the very next day the appellant wrote to the respondent, saying in part: \"We will quote on the suply of \u2026 the necessary Glued Laminated Timflat Trusses and the necessary purlins.\" (The italics are mine.) To me the inference is inescapable that the appellant was holding itself out to the respondent as the possessor of the skill and judgment required to determine what was necessary in this regard for the purposes of the contract in question, and it is noteworthy that more than a year later, in March 1952, after the respondent had been requested by Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation to place the order with Timber Structures of Canada Limited it still was only prepared to pass this request on to the appellant in the form of the granting of \"permission to place order with Timber Structures\".\nAlthough it may well be that the sequence of events which includes the bankruptcy of Timber Structures of Canada Limited has placed the appellant in a position which it had never intended to assume, I am nevertheless unable to find sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of reliance on its skill and judgment arising from the circumstances. The unanimous opinion of all the judges in both courts below is that the respondent relied on the skill and judgment of the appellant and that there were no circumstances such as to exclude the condition as to fitness which is implied by law. There was abundant evidence to support the finding that there was a breach of such condition. This, therefore, seems to me to be a case to which the following language employed by Martland J. in the Preload Co. of Canada Ltd. case, supra, can well be adapted. He there said at p. 822:\nThe question of the buyer's reliance on the seller's skill or judgment, \u2026 is, as stated by Lord Sumner in the Medway case, a question of fact. That question of fact has been decided by the Courts below in favour of the City. In my view there was ample evidence on which to base such a finding and I think that a preponderance of evidence justifies the conclusion which has been reached.\nI do not base my conclusion solely on any implication of reliance which may arise from the contract itself, but, like Mr. Justice MacDonald in the Court below, I prefer to base it on a wider ground, and I am content to adopt the language employed by him in the penultimate paragraph of his reasons for judgment where he says:\nI should prefer, however, to base my conclusion on the wider ground that having regard to the circumstances affecting the parties and the course of the negotiations leading to the contract, there is a clear preponderance of evidence to support the finding of the trial judge that Eastern disclosed to Laminated the purpose for which the wooden frame and component parts were required (namely, to support the roof of the garage and maintenance shed at Shearwater under such ordinary conditions as those which obtained when it collapsed); that it effectively disclosed to Laminated such reliance upon it; and that the cause of the collapse was within the area of that reliance. It is equally clear to me that neither the requirement of conformity to the plans and specifications nor the presence of Timber Structures \"in the picture\" as the probable, and, as it turned out, actual maker of the materials, operated to exclude such reliance or furnish proof that the reliance was placed on the latter Company and not upon Laminated.\nIn view of the above conclusions, I do not find it necessary to deal with the argument presented on behalf of the respondent in support of the contention that the appellant was liable in tort.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the defendant, appellant: Donald McInnes, Halifax.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent: H.

(Defendants), Respondents.\n1961: October 23, 24; 1962: January 23.\nPresent: Locke, Cartwright, Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION.\nReal property\u2014Transfer of land with reservation of mines and minerals\u2014 Reservation omitted from transferee's title by reason of registrar's error\u2014Subsequent transfer to volunteer with similar omission in both transfer and new certificate of title\u2014Corrections subsequently made to certificates of title\u2014Issue as to title to the mines and minerals\u2014The Land Titles Act, 1906 (Alta.), c. 24, ss. 23, 41, 42, 44, 46, 104, 106, 114(2) and (3), 135; R.S.A. 1922, c. 133, ss. 50, 51, 66, 68, 148, 150, 160, 175\u2014Inapplicability of The Limitation of Actions Act, 1935 (Alta.), c. 8.\nIn 1919, JL, as executor of the estate of AL, became the registered owner of certain land. A transfer was registered from JL to UK of this land \"reserving therefrom all mines and minerals\". By an error of the registrar, the certificate of title issued to UK omitted the reservation of mines and minerals and contained only a reservation of coal in favour of the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. In 1924, UK executed a transfer, without consideration, to herself and her husband FK. Both the transfer and the new certificate of title contained a reservation as to coal but no reservation in respect of other mines and minerals. Corrections were subsequently made to the three certificates of title. That of JL, which had been stamped as \"cancelled\" following the transfer to UK, had the cancellation stamp crossed out and the notation on the certificate stating that it had been cancelled in full was later altered to read \"in full EX M & M\". The remaining certificates were altered to include the reservation of mines and minerals. The issue in the appeal was as to the title to the mines and minerals, other than coal, in the land. The trial judge and the majority of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta held that they were the property of the estate of AL. The respondent company was the lessee of petroleum and natural gas and related hydro-carbons in the land, by virtue of leases made in its favour by the successors in title of AL. Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe submission that ss. 23, 41 and 46 of The Land Titles Act, 1906 (Alta.), c. 8, and the equivalent sections of R.S.A. 1922, c. 133, have the mandatory effect that, upon the registration of any transfer there is automatically created the estate or interest, defined in such transfer, in favour of the transferee, irrespective of whether or not the transferor had any legal estate or interest which he was entitled to transfer, was rejected. The power and duty of a Court to rectify the register where a wrongdoer has become registered as owner of land also apply to a case in which registration of title has been obtained by a volunteer, who registers a transfer from a transferor who had no legal right to give it, provided that the rights of third parties are not implicated. Here the AL estate was the registered owner of the mines and minerals in question and had never, by transfer or otherwise, divested itself of those mines and minerals. Assets Company, Ltd. v. Mere Roihi, [1905] A.C. 176, distinguished; Lohe Yew v. Port Swettenham Rubber Co., Ltd., [1913] A.C. 491; Imperial Bank of Canada v. Esakin, [1924] 2 W.W.R. 33, approved.\nSections 42, 44 and 104 of the 1906 Act are not to be construed as meaning that, once a certificate of title has issued, the title of the registered owner is thereafter to be deemed as conclusive and to be subject to attack only in case of fraud, misdescription or the existence of a prior certificate of title. The conclusiveness of a certificate of title, referred to in s. 44 (s. 58 of the 1922 Act), must be considered in the context of the scheme of the Act as a whole and in particular in relation to ss. 106, 114(2) and (3) and 135 (equivalent ss. 150, 160 and 175 of the 1922 Act). In the light of these sections the conclusiveness referred to in s. 44 is for the benefit of the bona fide purchaser for valuable consideration only. Here it was conceded that no consideration was given for the transfer which was made by UK to herself and her husband. Sutherland v. Rural Municipality of Spruce Grove No. 619, [1919] 1 W.W.R. 274; Minchau v. Busse, [1940] 2 D.L.R. 282, referred to; CPU. and Imperial Oil Ltd. v. Turta, [1954] S.C.R. 427, distinguished. The Land Titles Act altered the common law rule that no man can convey a better title than he possesses only to the extent that it established certain special rights for the benefit of the bona fide purchaser for value. Accordingly, the registration of a transfer from UK, who had no title to any minerals, to herself and her husband, made without consideration, did not confer any title to mines and minerals in the transferees.\nIt could not be successfully contended that the rights of the AL Estate to mines and minerals had been extinguished under the provisions of The Limitation of Actions Act, 1935 (Alta.), c. 8. If the appellants acquired no interest in the mines and minerals, as a result of the erroneous registration of the two transfers, as against the AL Estate, then there could be no basis for contending that the appellants ever had possession of them. C.P.R. and Imperial Oil Ltd. v. Turta, supra, applied.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta1, affirming, by a majority, a judgment of Primrose J.

Laycraft, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014On July 15, 1919, John Lafleur, of St. Albert, Alberta, the executor of the estate of Alexander Lafleur, deceased, became registered, in the North Alberta Land Registration District, as the owner of the North half of Section 9, Township 55, Range 25, West of the 4th Meridian, containing 320 acres more or less, excepting thereout 6 2\/100 acres more or less for the right-of-way of the Edmonton and Slave Lake Railway, the land thereby described containing 313 98\/100 acres more or less, reserving unto the Canadian Pacific Railway Company all coal on or under the said land.\nOn the same day a transfer was registered from John Lafleur to Urbanie Kaup, of Morinville, Alberta, of this half section, \"reserving therefrom all mines and minerals\".\nNotwithstanding this reservation of all mines and minerals in the transfer, a certificate of title was issued in the name of Urbanie Kaup in exactly the same terms as the certificate of title of John Lafleur, containing only a reservation of coal in favour of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\nThe land, the subject-matter of the transfer, had been purchased from John Lafleur by Fred Kaup, the husband of Urbanie Kaup, and by her, but the former had elected to have the title registered in his wife's name, he already being the registered owner of another quarter section of land. The purchase price of the land was $11,000, of which $8,000 was secured by a mortgage from Urbanie Kaup to John Lafleur, in which the description of the mortgaged land contained the reservation of \"all mines and minerals\".\nIn December 1924, after Kaup and his wife had decided that the title to the land should be registered in both names, Urbanie Kaup transferred the land to Fred Kaup and Urbanie Kaup for $1 and in consideration of natural love and affection. A new certificate of title was issued on December 20, 1924, in the names of both of them. Both the transfer and the new certificate of title, following the description of the land as it had appeared in Urbanie Kaup's certificate of title, contained a reservation of all coal to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, but no reservation in respect of other mines and minerals. It is conceded by the appellants that the transfer leading to this title was made without consideration.\nFred Kaup farmed the land until about 1938 or 1940, when he retired to Vancouver, after which the land was farmed by his son John. Urbanie Kaup died in 1953 and John Kaup is a beneficiary of her estate.\nCorrections were subsequently made to the three certificates of title, previously mentioned, by officials of the North Alberta Land Registration District. That of John Lafleur, which had been stamped as \"cancelled\" following the transfer to Urbanie Kaup, had the cancellation stamp crossed out. The notation on the certificate, stating that it had been cancelled in full, was altered so as to read \"in full Ex M & M\", so as to indicate that the title to the mines and minerals was not cancelled. According to the evidence, this latter change appears to have occurred some 20 or 25 years after the initial notation on the certificate of title had been made.\nThe reservations which had appeared on the certificate of title of Urbanie Kaup and on that of Fred Kaup and Urbanie Kaup were altered so as to reserve, in addition to coal, all other mines and minerals. The correction on Urbanie Kaup's certificate of title appears to have been made on February 18, 1948, and that on the certificate of title of Fred Kaup and Urbanie Kaup on June 3, 1943.\nThe issue in this appeal is as to the title to the mines and minerals, other than coal, in this land. The learned trial judge and the majority of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta have held that they were the property of the Lafleur Estate. The respondent Imperial Oil Limited is a lessee of petroleum and natural gas and related hydro-carbons in this land, by virtue of five leases made in its favour by the successors in title of Alexander Lafleur, executed in the year 1957.\nThe appellants concede that Urbanie Kaup acquired no title to mines and minerals by virtue of the registration of the transfer from John Lafleur to her. Notwithstanding this, they do contend that the subsequent transfer by her to Fred Kaup and herself, which purported to transfer mines and minerals other than coal, did result, upon its registration, in the acquisition of a title to such mines and minerals in their names. It is further contended that, even if such title was not an absolute one, but was defeasible at the instance of the Lafleur Estate, yet any right of that estate to mines and minerals was extinguished by virtue of the provisions of The Limitation of Actions Act, 1935 (Alta.), c. 8.\nThe respondents, in addition to disputing these contentions, submitted that the corrections to the three certificates of title were properly authorized under the provisions of The Land Titles Act, were effective, and that once corrected the effect was as if the error on the title had not been made.\nThe appellants' argument that the registration of the transfer from Urbanie Kaup to Fred Kaup and herself conveyed mines and minerals, other than coal, to the transferees, is based upon certain sections of The Land Titles Act, 1906 (Alta.), c. 24. That Act was in force at the time of the transfer from John Lafleur to Urbanie Kaup, although it had been repealed and replaced by c. 133, R.S.A. 1922, at the time of the registration of the transfer from Urbanie Kaup to Fred Kaup and herself. The provisions of the latter statute are substantially similar in effect. As the sections cited in argument and in the judgment in the Court below are from the 1906 Act, it is convenient to refer to those provisions here. The sections in question are as follows:\n23. Instruments registered in respect of or affecting the same land shall be entitled to priority the one over the other according to the time of registration and not according to the date of execution; and the registrar, upon registration thereof, shall retain the same in his office, and so soon as registered, every instrument shall become operative according to the tenor and intent thereof, and shall thereupon create, transfer, surrender, charge or discharge, as the case may be, the land or the estate or interest therein mentioned in the instrument.\n* * *\n41. After a certificate of title has been granted for any land, no instrument until registered under this Act shall be effectual to pass any estate or interest in any land (except a leasehold interest for three years or for a less period) or render such land liable as security for the payment of money; but upon the registration of any instrument in the manner hereinbefore prescribed the estate or interest specified therein shall pass, or, as the case may be, the land shall become liable as security in manner and subject to the covenants, conditions and contingencies set forth and specified in such instrument or by this Act declared to be implied in instruments of a like nature.\n* * *\n46. After the certificate of title for any land has been granted no instrument shall be effectual to pass any interest therein or to render the land liable as security for the payment of money as against any bona fide transferee of the land under this Act unless such instrument is executed in accordance with the provisions of this Act and is duly registered thereunder; and the registrar shall have power to decide whether any instrument which is presented to him for registration is substantially in conformity with the proper form in the schedule to this Act or not and to reject any instrument which he may decide to be unfit for registration.\nThe relevant equivalent sections of The Land Titles Act, R.S.A. 1922, c. 133, are ss. 50 and 51, which provide as follows:\n50. After a certificate of title has been granted for any land, no instrument shall be effectual to pass any estate or interest in such land (except a leasehold interest for three years or for a less period) or render such land liable as security for the payment of money, unless such instrument is executed in accordance with the provisions of this Act and is duly registered thereunder; but upon the registration of any such instrument in the manner hereinbefore prescribed the estate or interest specified therein shall pass, or, as the case may be, the land shall become liable as security in manner and subject to the covenants, conditions and contingencies set forth and specified in such instrument or by this Act declared to be implied in instruments of a like nature.\n51. So soon as registered every instrument shall become operative according to the tenor and intent thereof, and shall thereupon create, transfer, surrender, charge or discharge, as the case may be, the land or the estate or interest therein mentioned in the instrument.\nThe proposition submitted by the appellants is that these sections have the mandatory effect that, upon the registration of any transfer, there is automatically created the estate or interest, defined in such transfer, in favour of the transferee, irrespective of whether or not the transferor had any legal estate or interest which he was entitled to transfer. This result flows, it is said, irrespective of whether the transferee was a bona fide purchaser for value or not.\nIt is then argued that, the transferee having acquired the legal title, ss. 42, 44 and subss. (d), (e) and (f) of s. 104 of the 1906 Act come into play to protect his interest and that, in consequence, Fred and Urbanie Kaup could only be deprived of title to the mines and minerals, if at all, on one of the grounds defined in those provisions. Those sections read as follows:\n42. The owner of land for which a certificate of title has been granted shall hold the same subject (in addition to the incidents implied by virtue of this Act) to such encumbrances, liens, estates or interests as are notified on the folio of the register which constitutes the certificate of title absolutely free from all other encumbrances, liens, estates or interests whatsoever, except in case of fraud wherein he has participated or colluded and except the estate or interest of an owner claiming the same land under a prior certificate of title granted under the provisions of this Act or granted under any law heretofore in force relating to title to real property. (2) Such priority shall, in favour of any person in possession of land, be computed with reference to the grant or earliest certificate of title under which he or any person through whom he derives title has held such possession.\n* * *\n44. Every certificate of title granted under this Act shall (except in fcase of fraud wherein the owner has participated or colluded) so long as the same remains in force and uncancelled under this Act be conclusive evidence in all courts as against His Majesty and all persons whomsoever that the person named therein is entitled to the land included in the same, for the estate or interest therein specified, subject to the exceptions and reservations mentioned in the next preceding section, except so far as regards any portion of land by wrong description of boundaries or parcels included in such certificate of title and except as against any person claiming under a prior certificate of title granted under this Act or granted under any law heretofore in force relating to titles to real property in respect of the same land; and for the purpose of this section that person shall be deemed to claim under a prior certificate of title who is holder of or whose claim is derived directly or indirectly from the person who was the holder of the earliest certificate of title granted, notwithstanding that such certificate of title has been surrendered and a new certificate of title has been granted upon any transfer or other instrument.\n* * *\n104. No action of ejectment or other action for the recovery of any land for which a certificate of title has been granted shall lie or be sustained against the owner, under this Act in respect thereof, except in any of the following cases, that is to say:\n* * *\n(d) The case of a person deprived of any land by fraud as against the owner of such land through fraud, or as against a person deriving title otherwise than as a transferee bona fide for value, from or through such owner through fraud;\n(e) The case of a person deprived of or claiming any land included in any grant or certificate of title of other land by misdescription of such other land or of its boundaries, as against the owner of such other land;\n(f) The case of am owner claiming under an instrument of title prior in date of registration under this Act, or under the provisions of any law heretofore in force in any case in which two or more grants, or two or more certificates of title, or a grant and certificate of title, are registered under this Act or under any such law in respect to the same land.\nThe section of the 1922 Act which is the equivalent of s. 42 of the 1906 Act is s. 56, which provides as follows:\n56. (1) The owner of land in whose name a certificate of title has been granted shall, except in case of fraud wherein he has participated or colluded, hold the same subject (in addition to the incidents implied by virtue of this Act) to such incumbrances, liens, estates or interests as are notified on the folio of the register which constitutes the certificate of title absolutely free from all other incumbrances, liens, estates or interests whatsoever except the estate or interest of an owner claiming the same land under a prior certificate of title granted under the provisions of this Act or granted under any law heretofore in force relating to title to real property. (2) Such priority shall, in favour of any person in possession of land, be computed with reference to the grant or earliest certificate of title under which he or any person through whom he derives title has held such possession.\nSection 58 of the 1922 Act uses the same wording as s. 44 of the 1906 Act and s. 148 of the 1922 Act uses the same wording as s. 104 of the 1906 Act.\nThe appellants cite the decision of this Court in C.P.R. and Imperial Oil Ltd. v. Turta2, as authority for the proposition that there has been no fraud, no misdescription and no prior certificate of title on the facts of the present case.\nThe whole of the argument rests on the primary proposition that registration of a transfer, in itself, vests in the transferee a title which is indefeasible, save on those grounds specifically stated in ss. 42, 44 and 104 of the 1906 Act. I do not accept the appellants' interpretation of the meaning of ss. 23, 41 and 46 of the 1906 Act. I do not construe those provisions as doing more than to state what is a basic principle of The Land Titles Act system that it is only the registration of an instrument under that Act, and not its execution and delivery, which can be effective to convey a legal interest under the statute. I do not consider that the wording of these sections is sufficient to alter the common law rule that no man can convey a better title than he possesses. That this rule was altered by the provisions of The Land Titles Act is undoubted, but, in my opinion, that result was achieved, not by the effect of the sections presently under consideration, but because of the special position which was given to the bona fide purchaser for value under other sections of the Act, to which I will refer later.\nReference was made, in argument, to the decision of the Privy Council in Assets Company, Limited v. Mere Roihi3. This decision dealt with three appeals from New Zealand, each involving the same appellant, which was the registered owner in possession of three parcels of land, the ownership of which was claimed by the various respondents in the three cases. The history of the circumstances leading up to the registration of the three titles is very complicated and differed in each case. The appellant's titles were attacked by the respondents on the grounds of fraud and also on the ground that such registration was invalid by reason of the invalidity of certain orders of the Native Land Court, a tribunal established by New Zealand legislation, on which warrants of the Governor, having the effect of Crown grants, were issued. In two of the cases the appellant was the registered purchaser, in good faith, of an improperly registered title. The third case differed from the other two in that the appellant, in that case, was the first owner to obtain registration on the permanent register. In all three cases the appellant had given consideration and the Privy Council negatived any fraud on the part of the appellant in relation to any of the three transactions.\nThe Privy Council decided in favour of the appellant. The decision is summarized in the headnote, as follows:\nBy the Land Transfer Acts of 1870 and 1885 the fraud which must be proved in order to invalidate the title of a registered purchaser for value, whether he buys from a prior registered owner or from a person claiming under a title certified under the Native Lands Acts, is actual, not constructive fraud, brought home to the person whose registered title is impeached or to his agents. Fraud by persons from whom he claims does not affect him unless knowledge of it is brought home to him or his agents.\nIt was further held that\nas the registration had been obtained in each case bona fide the effect thereof was conclusive to confer on the appellants a title unimpeachable by the respondents.\nWhile there are dicta in the reasons given which might appear to support the position now taken in the present appeal by the appellants, notably the statement at p. 191, referring to the provisions of the New Zealand Act regarding the Assurance Fund:\nThis provision, taken in connection with those already referred to, went far to shew that except in the excepted cases the registered certificate was to be conclusive, and that the remedy of persons wrongfully deprived of their property was to obtain damages from the wrong-doer,\nthe case itself does not, in my view, support the appellants' proposition. I do not think that it goes further than what is said of it by Baalman, in his \"Commentary on the Torrens System in New South Wales\", at p. 133:\nIt was settled by the Privy Council in Assets Co. v. Mere Roihi, that the quality known as indefeasibility attaches to a title immediately upon the entry, in the register-book, of the name of an innocent purchaser. That case dealt both with an original applicant and with a derivative purchaser, and it applied equally to both. The case certainly does not support the proposition that a registered owner of land, whose title has wrongfully been affected through an error of the Registrar, cannot obtain rectification of that error as against the person who became registered owner as a result of the error, or as against one who acquires title from him as a volunteer.\nI find support for my view in the later decision of the Privy Council in Loke Yew v. Port Swettenham Rubber Company, Limited4. That case involved the issue of the title to land which had been registered in the name of the respondent company pursuant to a transfer to it from the prior registered owner. Prior to the making of such transfer, the company had knowledge of an unregistered interest, as to a portion of the land, in the appellant Loke Yew. In order to induce the prior registered owner to transfer the whole of the land to it, the company had, in writing stated: \"As regards Loke Yew's interest I shall have to make my own arrangements.\"\nThe respondent company relied on a statutory provision, similar in effect to s. 44 of the 1906 Act, whereby the duplicate certificate of title was made conclusive evidence of absolute and indefeasible ownership, subject only to certain exceptions, including fraud.\nThe Privy Council did find that there had been fraud in this case, so as to come within the exception in that section, but it went on to add further reasons in the following statement, at p. 504:\nThe conclusion to which their Lordships have come as to the transfer having been obtained by fraud brings the case within the exception of s. 7 and is therefore a sufficient answer to these arguments. But their Lordships are of opinion that for other reasons they are irrelevant and beside the mark. They take no account of the power and duty of a Court to direct rectification of the register. So long as the rights of third parties are not implicated a wrong-doer cannot shelter himself under the registration as against the man who has suffered the wrong. Indeed the duty of the Court to rectify the register in proper cases is all the more imperative because of the absoluteness of the effect of the registration if the register be not rectified.\nIn this passage, reference is made to the position of a wrongdoer who becomes registered as the owner of land. In my opinion, the same reasoning, as to the power and duty of a Court to rectify the register, can and should also be applied to a case in which registration of title has been obtained by a volunteer, who registers a transfer from a transferor who had no legal right to give it, provided that the rights of third parties are not implicated. While there is no suggestion of wrongdoing in the present case, yet it should be remembered that, whereas, in the Loke Yew case, the transferor was the registered owner of the land, who had the legal power to transfer it, in the present case the transferor had no interest of any kind in the minerals to convey.\nThe power of the Court to order a rectification of the register is set out in s. 116 of the 1906 Act, which provides as follows:\n116. In any proceeding respecting land or in respect of any transaction or contract relating thereto, or in respect of any instrument, caveat, memorandum or entry affecting land, the judge by decree or order may direct the registrar to cancel, correct, substitute, or issue any duplicate certificate, or make any memorandum or entry thereon or on the certificate of title and otherwise to do every act necessary to give effect to the decree or order.\nThe same provision was incorporated in the later Land Titles Acts and presently appears as s. 188(1) in c. 170, R.S.A. 1955.\nReferring to the passage, above quoted, from the Loke Yew case, Lamont J.A., in Imperial Bank of Canada v. Esakin5, has this to say:\nSec. 7, referred to by his Lordship, provided the title of the person named in the certificate of title should be absolute and indefeasible, except in cases of fraud, misrepresentation or adverse possession, and it was upon this section that the arguments for the plaintiffs were based. Notwithstanding the clear language of the section, the above-quoted passage, in my opinion, clearly indicates that, even if the Court had not found fraud on the part of the plaintiffs, it would \"for other reasons\" have set aside the plaintiffs' title to the Loke Yew lands for which they have given no consideration, and these \"other reasons,\" as I interpret the judgment, were, that, as between the registered owner who is a volunteer and a person rightfully entitled to the land, the Court would hold the registered owner to be a trustee for the rightful owner and would rectify the title, by cancelling that of the registered owner and causing a new certificate to be issued to the person really entitled.\nWith this statement I agree. In the present case, unlike the Loke Yew case, it is not necessary to invoke the principle of trusteeship because, while Loke Yew's interest had, at all times, been an unregistered one, in the present case the Lafleur Estate was the registered owner of the mines and minerals in question and had never, by transfer or otherwise, divested itself of those mines and minerals.\nI turn now to ss. 42, 44 and 104 of the 1906 Act, previously cited. Section 42 declares the rights of an owner of land, under the Act, for which a certificate of title has been granted. Section 44 declares the evidentiary value of a certificate of title in legal proceedings and s. 104 defines those cases in which an action of ejectment, or for the recovery of land, may lie as against the owner. Are these sections to be construed as meaning that, once a certificate of title has issued, the title of the registered owner is thereafter to be deemed as conclusive and to be subject to attack only in the case of fraud, misdescription or the existence of a prior certificate of title? I think not, and in this respect I agree with the views expressed by Harvey C.J.A., in Sutherland v. Rural Municipality of Spruce Grove No. 5196. In that case the defendant municipality took forfeiture proceedings for tax enforcement in respect of certain lands registered in the name of Sutherland, obtained an adjudication which was registered and subsequently acquired certificates of title to the land in its name. The plaintiff Sutherland sued, asking for an order cancelling the certificates of title in the name of the municipality and vesting the land in himself and other parties interested, on the ground that the proceedings taken by the municipality leading to its obtaining its certificates of title had been illegal. The defendant contended that its certificates of title were an absolute bar to the plaintiff's action and, in particular, relied upon s. 104 of The Land Titles Act of 1906. After referring to the provisions of that section, Harvey C.J.A. went on to say:\nIs this an action for the recovery of land within the meaning of the section? I think not. It is to be noted that when it was begun the plaintiff supposed he was the registered owner, but even then he makes no claim for recovery of the land, but only for its discharge from taxes. Later, when it is found that the certificates of title have been issued to the defendants, he asks for their cancellation. If the certificate of title is to be a bar to any action to set it aside we would have a somewhat anomalous situation. Any one who had become registered as owner through any error in the office or otherwise, or in any of many other ways which occur to me, would thereby become entitled to hold land to which he has no right. In my opinion, the conclusiveness of a certificate of title, referred to in s. 44 of the 1906 Act, must be considered in the context of the scheme of the Act as a whole and, in particular, in relation to ss. 106, 114(2) and (3) and 135 of that Act. Those sections provide as follows:\n106. Nothing in this Act contained shall be so interpreted as to leave subject to action for recovery of damages as aforesaid, or to action of ejectment, or to deprivation of land in respect to which he is registered as owner, any purchaser or mortgagee bona fide for valuable consideration of land under this Act on the plea that his transferor or mortgagor has been registered as owner through fraud or error or has derived title from or through a person registered as owner through fraud or error, except in the case of misdescription, as mentioned in section one hundred and four.\n* * *\n114. (2) If it appears to the satisfaction of the registrar that any duplicate certificate of title or other instrument has been issued in error or contains any misdescription, or that any entry or indorsement has been made in error on any certificate of title or other instrument, or that any such certificate, instrument, entry or indorsement was fraudulently or wrongfully obtained, he may, whether such certificate or instrument is in his custody or has been produced to him in answer to a demand, so far as practicable without prejudicing rights conferred for value, cancel or correct any error in such certificate of title or other instrument, or in any entry made thereon or in any memorial, certificate, exemplification or copy of any instrument made in or issued from the land titles office, and may supply entries to be made:\nProvided always that in the correction of any such error he shall not erase or render illegible the original words, and he shall affix the date upon which such correction was made or entry supplied.\n(3) Every certificate of title so corrected, and every entry so corrected or supplied, shall have the like validity and effect as if such error had not been made or such entry omitted.\n* * *\n135. Except in the case of fraud, no person contracting or dealing with or taking or proposing to take a transfer, mortgage, encumbrance or lease, from the owner of any land for which a certificate of title has been granted shall be bound or concerned to inquire into or ascertain the circumstances in or the consideration for which the owner or any previous owner of the land is or was registered or to see to the application of the purchase money or of any part thereof, nor shall he be affected by notice direct, implied or constructive, of any trust or unregistered interest in the land, any rule of law or equity to the contrary notwithstanding; and the knowledge that any trust or unregistered interest is in existence shall not of itself be imputed as fraud.\nThe equivalent sections of the 1922 Act are 150, 160 and 175.\nWhen regard is had to these sections it appears that the conclusiveness referred to in s. 44 is for the benefit of the bona fide purchaser for valuable consideration only. This view was stated in this Court by Crocket J. in Minchau v. Busse7, where he says, referring to the opinion of the dissenting judges in the Court below:\nI agree with the view expressed by Mr. Justice Clarke and Mr. Justice Ford in the reasons for their dissenting opinion, as delivered by the latter, that the sections of the Land Titles Act as to the conclusiveness of the certificate of title are for the benefit of those who bona fide acquire title on the faith of the register and that in the present instance Busse did not so acquire his title.\nI do not find anything in the case of C.P.R. and Imperial Oil Ltd. v. Turta, supra, which is contrary to this view. The decision in that case rested solely upon the ground that Turta was a bona fide purchaser for value of the minerals there in question and that, because of that fact, his position could only be attacked on one or more of the three grounds previously mentioned. It emphasizes the special position enjoyed, under the Act, by the bona fide purchaser for value. In the present case, admittedly, the appellants are not in that position, it having been conceded that no consideration was given for the transfer which was made by Mrs. Kaup to herself and her husband.\nI do not find in the Turta case any suggestion that Turta's position would have been the same had he not been a bona fide purchaser for value. The decision is based upon the fact that he was. Estey J. (at p. 443), with whom Kerwin J., as he then was, and Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. agreed, cited, with approval, the view of the Act expounded by Harvey C.J.A. in Dobek v. Jennings8, as follows:\nThe principle of the Act is that a person may ascertain the state of the title by a reference to the records of the land titles office and the person who is the registered owner has the right by transfer duly registered to convey a good title to a bona-fide purchaser subject only to what appears on the register and the reservations and exceptions of Sec. 58 (i.e. Sec. 44 of the 1906 Act).\nHe also cited the well known statement of Lord Watson in Gibbs v. Messer9:\nThe object is to save persons dealing with registered proprietors from the trouble and expense of going behind the register, in order to investigate the history of their author's title, and to satisfy themselves of its validity. That end is accomplished by providing that every one who purchases, in bona fide and for value, from a registered proprietor, and enters his deed of transfer or mortgage on the register, shall thereby acquire an indefeasible right, notwithstanding the infirmity of his author's title. The sections of the Act dealing with the position of the bona fide purchaser for value, which I have mentioned, support these views as to the purpose and intent of the Act. The fact that these provisions were incorporated in the statute negatives the suggestion that the Act further cur-tails the old common law rule that no man can convey a better title than he possesses, so as to enable a transferor, having no title at all, to vest in a volunteer a legal title valid as against the true owner. In my opinion, The Land Titles Act altered that rule only to the extent that it established certain special rights for the benefit of the bona fide purchaser for value. Accordingly, the registration of a transfer from Urbanie Kaup, who had no title to any minerals, to herself and her husband, made without consideration, did not confer any title to mines and minerals in the transferees.\nHaving reached this conclusion, I do not see how the provisions of The Limitation of Actions Act can be successfully invoked by the appellants to contend that the rights of the Lafleur Estate to mines and minerals had been extinguished. The position is that the appellants never, at any time, acquired a title to mines and minerals which was valid as against the Lafleur Estate. If the appellants acquired no interest in those mines and minerals, as a result of the erroneous registration of the two transfers, as against the Lafleur Estate, then there can be no basis for contending that the appellants ever had possession of them. There is no evidence which would support the claim that they exercised open, notorious and exclusive possession of them. On the contrary, Fred Kaup, in his evidence, when referring to the purchase of the land from John Lafleur, said: \"There was nothing else discussed. Mineral rights\u2014them days we didn't know what mineral rights was.\" There is no evidence of any attempt by the appellants to exercise control over, or to deal with the mineral rights. They merely farmed the surface of the land. On the contrary, the respondents paid the mineral taxes in respect of those minerals.\nUnder these circumstances I think the views expressed by Rand J. in this Court, in the Turta case at p. 456, properly should be applied:\nThe remaining question is whether the action is barred by the Limitation of Actions Act, c. 133, R.S.A. 1942. On the view which I have taken that the petroleum rights were acquired by Turta and the Pacific Company deprived of them, the possession, in the absence of physical workings and so far as such incorporeal rights can be the subject of possession, must be taken to be an incident of ownership. In the circumstances there has been no legal or physical disturbance of that possession; at the most, certain entries have been made on the certificate claiming rights which do not exist. The action is not, then, one to recover the land but to have those entries expunged and for a declaration of the plaintiff's interest. Since there has been no trespass and since the steps taken have, at the most, raised only a cloud upon the title, the question is whether an owner can be deprived of his land by the mere assertion on the register of unfounded claims. I know of no provision of law which, by the passage of time, raises any right based on that mode of protesting an interest ; it would be a novel form of prescription which the law does not recognize. Its true interpretation is that of a continuing assertion against which proceedings of the nature here can be taken at any time, and no question of limitation arises.\nThe opinion of the minority judges in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta is clearly based on the proposition that, following the registration of the transfer to Fred Kaup and Urbanie Kaup, they thereby acquired a legal interest in the mines and minerals, other than coal, and that during the period from the issuance of their title until June 3, 1943, when the corrections were made, there had been no severance of the title to mines and minerals, other than coal, from the surface of the land. With respect, for the reasons already outlined, I do not accept this premise and without that premise the reasoning of the minority judgment cannot properly be applied.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Morrow, Hurlburt, Reynolds, Stevenson & Kane, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Chambers, Might, Saucier, Peacock, Jones, Black & Gain, Calgary.\n1 (1961), 35 W.W.R. 433, 29 D.L.R.

The latter was, at all relevant times, in bankruptcy. The appellant surety company bonded P for the due performance of its contract. On December 31, 1959, the appellant paid the respondent a sum comprising the amount of the bond plus the taxed costs. The respondent claimed interest on this sum to December 31, 1959, and interest on the amount so claimed, at five per cent per annum, from that date. It caused a writ of execution to issue against the appellant for the amount claimed. The appellant applied to have the writ set aside, contending, on the hearing of the application, that the respondent was not entitled to claim the interest. The application was refused and an appeal from that decision was dismissed unanimously by the Court of Appeal. The appellant then applied to this Court for leave to appeal and the case was argued on the merits at the same time. The position of the appellant was that the judgment did not create a judgment debt within the meaning of the Interest Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 156, because as of its date, there was no specific sum of money made payable by the appellant to the respondent.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe effect of the judgment was that, at the expiration of thirty days from the date thereof, the respondent should recover from the appellant a sum of money then immediately ascertainable; i.e. the amount of the bond, minus any sum which, during that period, had been realized from P. That amount was a sum of money made payable by a judgment, within the meaning of s. 15 of the Interest Act. There was no reference by the Court to determine the amount of the damages, for the obvious reason that no such reference was necessary. There was no requirement that the matter be brought back before the Court after the thirty-day period, because that, too, was unnecessary. Interest, therefore, began to run, applying s. 15 of the Act, as soon as the amount payable became ascertained. Gibbs v. Flight (1853), 22 L.J.C.P. 256; Garner v. Briggs (1858), 27 L.J. Ch. 483, distinguished; Ashover Fluor Spar Mines, Ltd. v. Jackson, [1911] 2 Ch. 355, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan1, affirming a judgment of Thomson J. declaring the respondent, a judgment creditor, to be entitled to interest on its judgment and costs. Appeal dismissed.\nR. A. MacKimmie, Q.C., and R. M. Balfour, Q.C., for the defendant by counterclaim, appellant.\nj. L. McDougall, Q.C., E. D. Noonan, Q.C., and G. Fraser Stewart, Q.C., for the plaintiff by counterclaim, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014In this action the respondent, the City of Regina, was found to have suffered damages in the amount of $1,281,407.55 by reason of non-performance by The Preload Company of Canada Limited (hereinafter referred to as \"Preload\") of its contract with the respondent to manufacture and deliver a type of prestressed concrete pipe. Preload was, at all relevant times, in bankruptcy. The appellant, The Guarantee Company of North America, bonded Preload for the due performance of its contract, the bond being in the amount of $1,209,258.57. The judgment at the trial was sustained by the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan and in this Court2. In due course the costs against the appellant were taxed and allowed at $10,588.87.\nOn December 31, 1959, the appellant paid the respondent a total sum of $1,219,847.44, being the amount of the bond, plus the taxed costs. No payment was made in respect of interest on the judgment. The respondent claims interest of $183,925.15 on the judgment and taxed costs to December 31, 1959, and interest on that amount, at 5 per cent per annum, from that date. It caused a writ of execution to issue against the appellant on March 22, 1960, for the amount claimed. The appellant applied to have the writ set aside, contending, on the hearing of the application, that the respondent was not entitled to claim the interest. The application was refused and an appeal from that decision was dismissed unanimously by the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan3. The appellant applied for leave to appeal from that decision and the case was argued on the merits at the same time. In view of the decision which I have reached on the merits, it is unnecessary for me to express any view as to whether leave to appeal was necessary or whether, if it was necessary, it should have been granted.\nThe issue is as to the respondent's right to claim interest from the appellant and that right depends upon the application of ss. 12 to 15 inclusive of the Interest Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 156, which provide as follows:\nMANITOBA, BRITISH COLUMBIA, SASKATCHEWAN, ALBERTA AND THE TERRITORIES.\n12. Sections 13, 14 and 15 apply to the Provinces of Manitoba, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta and to the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Territory only.\n13. Every judgment debt shall bear interest at the rate of five per cent per annum until it is satisfied.\n14. Unless it is otherwise ordered by the court, such interest shall be calculated from the time of the rendering of the verdict or of the giving of the judgment, as the case may be, notwithstanding that the entry of the judgment upon the verdict or upon the giving of the judgment has been suspended by any proceedings either in the same court or in appeal.\n15. Any sum of money or any costs, charges or expenses made payable by or under any judgment, decree, rule or order of any court whatsoever in any civil proceeding shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be a judgment debt. In his reasons for judgment at the trial the learned trial judge said:\nFor the above reasons the City is entitled to payment by the Surety of the amount of damages suffered by the City as a result of non-performance of the contract by the Preload Company and the Trustee up to and including the amount of the bond, namely $1,209,258.57, or such lesser amount as remains unrealized within a reasonable time by the City from its claim filed with the Trustee in bankruptcy. This claim amounts to; $1,281,407.55.\nIf, therefore, at the expiration of thirty days from the date hereof there is any amount up to and including the said sum of $1,209,258.57 unrealized by the City, the City will have judgment against the Surety for such amount together with its costs.\nThe formal judgment was dated November 20, 1956, and provided as follows:\n6. AND IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that The City of Regina, Plaintiff (by counterclaim), is entitled to payment by The Guarantee Company of North America, Defendant (by counterclaim), of the amount of damages suffered by the said The City of Regina as a result of non-performance of the said contract by The Preload Company of Canada Limited up to and including the amount of the bond given by the said, The Guarantee Company of North America to The City of Regina, namely, $1,209,258.57, or such lesser amount as remains unrealized by The City of Regina from its said claim for the damages referred to in clause 3 hereof, namely, $1,281,407.55.\n7. AND IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that if, at the expiration of thirty days from the date hereof, there is any amount up to and including the said sum of $1,209,258.57 unrealized by The City of Regina from its said debt provable against the said The Preload Company of Canada Limited, in bankruptcy, for the amount of damages referred to in clause 3 hereof, namely $1,281,407.55, that The City of Regina recover against The Guarantee Company of North America the said sum of $1,209,258.57, or such lesser amount as remains unrealized by The City of Regina from its said claim for the damages referred to in clause 3 hereof, namely, $1,281,407.55.\nIt further provided:\n9. AND IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that proceedings under this Judgment be stayed for a period of thirty days from the date hereof and that if an appeal is taken from this Judgment then that proceedings under this Judgment be stayed until the matter is finally disposed of.\nNo payment was ever received by the respondent from Preload, save the costs taxed against the trustee personally, which were paid on March 29, 1960.\nThe appellant's position is that the judgment did not create a judgment debt within the meaning of the Interest Act because, as of its date, there was no specific sum of money made payable by the appellant to the respondent. The judgment, it is said, was conditional and was for an uncertain amount, whereas, to constitute a final judgment, it would have to be in terms sufficient in itself to adjudge payment of a specific sum of money. It was contended that some further step was necessary to have the amount of the judgment finally determined and that no such step had been taken. Reliance was placed on the English decisions of Gibbs v. Flight4, and Garner v. Briggs5.\nIn my opinion, while this argument might lead to the conclusion that there was not a judgment debt, within the meaning of s. 15 of the Interest Act, in existence on November 20, 1956, the date of the judgment, I think there was a judgment debt in existence after the expiration of thirty days from that date. Paragraph 6 of the judgment adjudged that the respondent was entitled to payment of its damages up to the amount of the bond, or such lesser amount as remained unrealized from Preload. Paragraph 7 then went on to provide that, if, at the expiration of thirty days from the date of the judgment, any amount up to $1,209,258.57 was unrealized by the respondent from its debt against Preload in bankruptcy, the respondent should recover that sum, or such lesser amount as remained unrealized from the appellant.\nThe effect of these two paragraphs is that, at the expiration of thirty days from the date of the judgment, the respondent should recover from the appellant a sum of money then immediately ascertainable; i.e., $1,209,258.57, minus any sum which, during that period, had been realized from Preload. In my opinion, that amount was a sum of money made payable by a judgment, within the meaning of s. 15 of the Interest Act. There was no reference by the Court to determine the amount of damages, for the obvious reason that no such reference was necessary. There was no requirement that the matter be brought back before the Court after the thirty-day period, because that, too, was unnecessary. Interest, therefore, began to run, applying s. 15 of the Interest Act, as soon as the amount payable became ascertained.\nThe two English cases previously mentioned were concerned with the application of s. 18 of the Judgments Act, 1838, by which the effect of judgments was given to decrees and orders of Courts of Equity, rules of Courts of Law and orders in bankruptcy for the payment of money; all remedies given by the Act to judgment creditors were given to persons to whom any moneys were, by such orders or rules, directed to be paid.\nThe issue in Gibbs v. Flight, supra, was as to whether the rule of the Court in that case was within this section, so as to have the effect of a judgment. The question in issue was as to whether the order in question was an order to pay money. That order was that the defendants do pay, as costs, at a certain time and place, a certain sum of money \"unless in the meantime the said sum be paid to the plaintiffs out of the funds of the Parish of St. Stephen, Walbrook\". The plaintiffs in the proceedings were church wardens of the Parish mentioned and the earlier proceedings had indicated that the costs of both sides should be paid by the Parish.\nThe decision on this point is very brief, Jervis C.J. merely saying:\nBut then comes the question as to the execution, founded on the Rule of Court, whether the order is an \"order to pay money\" under the Statute of Victoria and, upon that point, we think that the execution-must be set aside; for we cannot consider that an order to pay money upon a condition, under such circumstances as in the present case, is such an order as will satisfy the statute.\nThe appellant contends that the order in the present case was similarly conditional and, therefore, was not an order for the payment of money under s. 15 of the Interest Act.\nThere is, however, a substantial difference between s. 18 of the Judgments Act, 1888, and s. 15 of the Interest Act. Section 18 provided:\nAnd be it enacted that all Decrees and Orders of Courts of Equity, and all Rules of Court \u2026 whereby any sum of money \u2026 shall be payable to any Person \u2026 shall have the effect of judgments in the Superior Courts of Common Law \u2026.\nThis section is defining that kind of order which, by its terms, should be given the effect of a judgment in the Superior Courts of Common Law. Section 15 of the Interest Act, on the other hand, is defining those sums of money which shall be deemed to be a judgment debt.\nThe question in Gibbs v. Flight was as to the nature of the order which had been made and, rightly or wrongly, it was held that, in the circumstances of that case, the order, being conditional when made, was not an order for the payment of money so as to qualify for the benefits of the section. The order, once made, could not, thereafter, change its nature in the event that the Parish failed to pay the amount mentioned. The question in the present case, however, is not as to the nature of the order, but whether any sum of money was made payable by what is, undoubtedly, a judgment order. In my view, by the terms of that order, a sum of money, to be ascertained after the lapse of thirty days, was made payable.\nIn Gibbs v. Flight, after the failure of the Parish to pay the costs, I think there was, at that time, an order for the payment of a sum of money within the meaning of s. 15 of the Interest Act. But that was not the issue in that case. The sole question there was whether the order, at the time it was made, came within s. 18 of the Judgments Act, 1888, so as to have the effect of a judgment.\nGarner v. Briggs, supra, decided only that an order, declaring that the executor of an estate was liable to make good to the estate a certain sum of money and that such sum should be charged in his account of the personal estate, was not, in its terms, an order for the payment of money by the executor, so as to fall within s. 18 of the Judgments Act, because it did not order the executor to pay it.\nA statement of Eve J. in a more recent judgment, in Ashover Fluor Spar Mines, Limited v. Jackson6, which also dealt with s. 18 of the Judgments Act, 1838, is of interest in considering the application of that section. At p. 359, dealing with the order then under consideration before him, he said:\nIt belongs to a class of order with which we are all familiar, and stands somewhere between the two alternative forms in which such orders are usually made. In the first of the two alternative forms the inquiry is directed, and liberty to apply, after the result has been certified, is given. In the second alternative the Court, after directing the inquiry, goes on to order the defendant to pay to the plaintiff the amount certified. The latter of these orders is, in my opinion, within, and the former outside, the provisions of s. 18 of the Judgments Act, 1838.\nI think it is clear that the judgment order in the present case is within the second classification, as it was an order for the payment of a sum of money to be ascertained after the lapse of thirty days from the date of the order. For these reasons, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant by counterclaim, appellant: Balfour & Balfour, Regina.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff by counterclaim, respondent: G.

Malicious prosecution\u2014Action for\u2014Matters to be established\u2014Functions of trial judge silting without a jury.\nThe defendant insurance company issued a policy of insurance against fire and other risks on a truck belonging to the plaintiff. Shortly thereafter a fire originating in the truck caused serious damage to the vehicle. The defendant C, an adjuster employed by the insurance company, was instructed by the defendant LC, the company's office manager, to investigate the nature and cause of the damage. Following C's report it was decided to refer the matter to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The findings of a police investigating officer were submitted to the Attorney General's Department which advised that there was sufficient evidence to warrant a prosecution. The police officer informed LC of these facts and asked him to lay a criminal charge; LC did so and the charge was dismissed. A statement of claim was subsequently issued, the plaintiff claiming upon the policy and damages against all three defendants for malicious prosecution. A third cause of action asserted against C was that he had \"by false and malicious evidence and representations procured\" the magistrate at the preliminary hearing to commit the plaintiff on the charge. The action on the policy was allowed, but the action with regard to malicious prosecution was dismissed. The plaintiff's appeal as to the latter having been dismissed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, an appeal was brought to this Court. Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\nNo action lies for the institution of legal proceedings, however malicious, unless they have been instituted without reasonable and probable cause. Here the trial joidge, who sat without a jury, reached the conclusion that LC had acted in good faith and that there were reasonable and probable grounds for his laying the charge. This finding was concurred in by the Appellate Division. The burden of proving malice rested upon the plaintiff and the judges below implicitly found against him on that issue. There were no grounds upon which this Court could properly interfere with the judgment appealed from upon either of these issues. There was no finding in either of the lower Courts as to the claim advanced against C for allegedly giving false evidence and the matter, not having been argued in this Court, should be considered as abandoned.\nAbrath v. North Eastern Railway Co. (1883), 11 Q.B.D. 440; Cox v. English, Scottish and Australian Bank Ltd., [1905] A.C. 168; Laster v. Perryman (1870), L.R. 4 H.L. 521; Herniman v. Smith, [1938] A.C. 305, referred to.\nPer Cartwright J.: While, on the issue of the existence of malice, it may be said that the defendants were not responsible for the police officer's lack of care in the investigation which preceded the laying of the information, this could not be said with reference to the question whether or not the defendants had reasonable and probable cause for laying the information.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, dismissing an appeal from part of a judgment of Manning J. dismissing appellant's claim for damages for malicious prosecution. Appeal dismissed.\nS. G. Main, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nD. H. Bowen, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of Locke, Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nLocke J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta dismissing the appeal of the present appellant, the plaintiff in the action, from that part of the judgment of Manning J. at the trial which dismissed the plaintiff's claim for damages for malicious prosecution.\nThe respondent corporation, an insurance company, issued a policy of insurance against fire and other risks on a truck, the property of the appellant, for the period of one year from October 2, 1957. On the 14th day of November, 1957, while standing unattended on the property of the appellant at Island Lake, Alta., where it had been left a few minutes earlier by the appellant, a fire originating in the truck caused serious damage to the vehicle.\nThe respondent Christenson was at the time an adjuster employed in the Edmonton office of the respondent corporation and was instructed by the respondent Colborne, the office manager of the company at Edmonton, to investigate the nature and cause of the damage. On November 25 the appellant went to Edmonton and had an interview with Christenson in the company's office and then signed a written statement prepared by the latter, as a result of their conversation. Thereafter, Christenson went to the scene of the fire and examined the damaged truck and had a further interview with the appellant and with the latter's wife, at which interview he expressed doubts as to whether the fire had resulted from accidental causes. There is evidence that, at this latter interview, abusive language was used by both the appellant and Christenson, the latter questioning the truth of various statements made by Meyer during their interview in Edmonton on November 25.\nThe respondent Christenson reported his findings to the respondent Colborne and it was decided to refer the matter for investigation to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at Edmonton. As a result, Corporal Paley (later Sergeant), an experienced motor mechanic who had been charged with the duty of investigating automotive fires for the police since 1953, carried out an investigation. Before doing so, he interviewed the respondent Colborne and advised the latter that the policy of the Mounted Police in such investigations was to submit Paley's report to the Attorney General's Department and that, if the latter advised that there was sufficient evidence to prosecute, to ask the person requesting the police to investigate to lay a criminal charge. At that time Colborne agreed that if a prosecution was advised by the Department he would do this.\nPaley proceeded to Athabaska where the truck had been placed in a garage and conducted a thorough examination in an endeavour to form an opinion as to the origin of the fire. The result of this examination was explained in great detail at the trial. The truck which had been bought by the appellant second hand was in many respects in poor mechanical shape. The piston in the 6th cylinder was seized and in that condition the truck could not be operated. The gas tank situated behind the seat in the cab contained 4 gallons of gasoline which was intact and there was no leak in the tank. A gallon can of motor oil in the body of the truck was also found to be intact. There had, according to this witness, been but slight damage to that portion of the truck between the firewall and the radiator but the cab itself was extensively damaged, showing evidence of there having been a very intense fire there which occasioned very considerable destruction.\nPaley was aware of the statements that had been made by the appellant to Christenson during their interviews, including a statement that it had looked like a gas fire, but appears to have formed the opinion that fire had been set by the appellant, from the nature of the damage to the truck and the admitted fact that the appellant was the last person who had been in it prior to the fire and was only a short distance away conducting an examination of the cabins owned by him at the time the fire commenced.\nPaley prepared a written report of his findings and submitted it, with statements of certain witnesses, to Mr. J. W. Anderson, a solicitor in the Attorney General's Department whose duties included prosecuting criminal cases and who had several consultations with Paley. As a result Mr. Anderson said that:\nMy recommendation after due consideration was that there was sufficient evidence available to warrant taking the matter to a preliminary inquiry on a charge of arson.\nand he wrote a letter to the officer commanding the division of the Mounted Police to that effect. He did not mention in giving his evidence-in-chief and was not cross-examined as to the evidence submitted to him upon which he based his opinion, other than as above stated. Paley said that he informed the respondent Colborne of these facts and asked him to lay the charge and Colborne did so.\nThe charge as laid was that the appellant:\ndid unlawfully and wilfully and for a fraudulent purpose, namely to defraud the General Exchange Insurance Corporation, set fire to a 1955 G.M.C. truck, property of the said George W. Meyer, contrary to the provisions of Section 374(2) of the Criminal Code.\nAt the preliminary hearing both Christenson and Colborne gave evidence and the appellant was committed for trial. On October 8, 1958, the charge against the appellant was tried by McLaurin C.J. at the criminal sittings at Edmonton who dismissed it without calling upon the appellant to present any defence.\nThe statement of claim was issued on November 13, 1958, the appellant claiming the sum of $1,400 under the fire insurance policy and damages against all three of the respondents for malicious prosecution. A third cause of action asserted against the respondent Christenson was that he had:\nby false and malicious evidence and representations procured the said Magistrate Pearce to commit the plaintiff upon the said charge to the next Criminal Sittings of the Supreme Court of Alberta, to be held at Edmonton.\nDamages were not claimed separately in the prayer for relief upon the last mentioned claim, nor was it alleged that the respondent corporation or the respondent Colborne were parties to the alleged wrongful acts of Christenson. On the other hand, Christenson had not laid the information nor is there any evidence in the extensive record to show that he did anything more than to investigate the claim and report the matter to Colborne.\nBy way of defence to the action upon the policy, the respondent corporation pleaded that the appellant had made wilfully false and fraudulent statements in the written statement given to Christenson on November 25, these including, inter alia, that he had left the truck after turning off the motor on the morning in question and that the fire in the truck was fed from the gas tank. It was further alleged that the appellant had refused to sign a statement that the loss did not originate by any act, design or procurement on his part, that he had not filed a statutory declaration proving the loss as required by the statutory conditions and that the fire and any loss suffered had been caused by the appellant's \"wilful act, neglect, procurement and contrivance.\" The defence pleaded by all three defendants to the count for malicious prosecution was a general denial and an allegation that Colborne had reasonable and probable cause for laying the information. To the count alleging that Christenson had given false and malicious evidence at the preliminary hearing, the defence was a straight denial. After a trial lasting some eight days, the learned trial judge, Manning J., gave a short oral judgment. Dealing with the claim upon the policy, he said that he was not satisfied that the statements complained of were made fraudulently and if they were inaccurate it was probably the result of careless use of language. As to the defence that the appellant had not furnished a statutory declaration proving the loss, the learned judge held that, as the respondent corporation had failed to provide the required form, it could not rely upon this as a defence. Judgment was given against the respondent corporation for a sum of $796.75.\nThe issue raised by the defendant corporation's claim that the fire had been caused by the wilful act or procurement of the appellant was not dealt with. Despite the acquittal of the appellant by McLaurin C.J., this defendant was entitled to insist upon this ground of defence and, as the record shows, a great deal of evidence was given which, if accepted, might have justified a finding that the appellant had by his own act brought about the fire. While the learned trial judge did not either refer to this defence or in terms make any finding upon the issue, it is obvious that he was of the opinion that this defence failed since he gave judgment upon the policy for the amount of the loss. As to the issue of malicious prosecution, the reasons do not differentiate the position of the respondent Christenson, who neither signed the information or was shown to have been responsible in any way for bringing about the institution of the criminal proceedings, from that of the other defendants. Saying that the insurance company had made an investigation and come to the conclusion that there were grounds for suspicion and handed their file to Sgt. Paley, the learned judge said:\nSergeant Paley is a man who specializes in the investigation of fires. He investigated and concluded that there was a proper case for prosecution. I have obviously not agreed with the conclusion of Sergeant Paley because I have declined to give effect to the insurance company's claim of false and fraudulent statements; but I think I am bound to say that Sergeant Paley appeared to me to be a very competent man and a very reasonable man. When an official of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, like Sergeant Paley, makes a careful investigation and advises that a prosecution should be commenced, it does seem to me that there are reasonable and probable grounds for following the suggestion that he makes. I think I would feel that way if Sergeant Paley himself had been the only person involved but Sergeant Paley's advice was considered and concurred in by Mr. Anderson, a solicitor of the Attorney General's Department and it was following that that the charge was laid. Consequently, I feel that I must dismiss the action with regard to malicious prosecution.\nThe claim for damages against the respondent Christen-son by reason of the evidence given by the latter at the preliminary hearing was not mentioned by the learned judge and there is no finding as to whether the evidence complained of was true or false. Since, however, the action was dismissed against Christenson, it must be assumed that the learned judge was of the opinion that the allegations made against him in the pleading had not been made out.\nThe appeal to the Appellate Division was heard by Macdonald, Johnson and Kane JJ.A. and the judgment of the Court was delivered orally by the last named at the conclusion of the argument. There had been no cross-appeal from the judgment delivered against the respondent corporation on the policy and the reasons delivered do not indicate that the claim against Christenson in respect of the evidence given by him at the preliminary hearing had been argued before the Court. In the brief reasons delivered the Court found that if there had been a want of care by Paley in his investigation the respondents were not liable for it and, as to Christenson's investigation, that \"any failures on his part in respect of his investigation are not of the type from which malice must necessarily be inferred.\" It was further found that \"the conduct of those concerned was a matter for consideration by the trial judge. This conduct does not in itself raise an inference of malice such as would require us to say the trial judge was wrong\". The reasons concluded:\nConsidering all the evidence there is evidence on which the learned trial judge could find, as he did, that the respondents had reasonable grounds for laying the charge in the reasons stated by him. It is, therefore, a finding of fact.\nThe matters to be established by a plaintiff in an action for damages for malicious prosecution are as stated by Bowen L.J. in Abrath v. North Eastern Railway Co.1:\nThis action is for malicious prosecution, and in an action for malicious prosecution the plaintiff has to prove, first, that he was innocent and that his innocence was pronounced by the tribunal before which the accusation was made; secondly, that there was a want of reasonable and probable cause for the prosecution, or, as it may be otherwise stated, that the circumstances of the case were such as to be in the eyes of the judge inconsistent with the existence of reasonable and probable cause; and, lastly, that the proceedings of which he complains were initiated in a malicious spirit, that is, from an indirect and improper motive, and not in furtherance of justice.\nAt p. 457 that learned judge said further:\nNow in an action for malicious prosecution the plaintiff has the burden throughout of establishing that the circumstances of the prosecution were such that a judge can see no reasonable or probable cause for instituting it.\nThis statement of the law was approved and adopted by the Judicial Committee in Cox v. English, Scottish and Australian Bank Ltd.2\nThe respondent Colborne did not know the appellant and obtained the information upon which he acted from the respondent Christenson and from Sgt. Paley, and swore that these facts indicated to him and there was no doubt in his mind that the fire was \"intentional\" and that in laying the charge he relied upon the advice of the Attorney General's Department, communicated to him by Paley.\nNo action lies for the institution of legal proceedings, however malicious, unless they have been instituted without reasonable and probable cause (Lister v. Perryman3). Reasonable and probable cause means a genuine belief based on reasonable grounds that the proceedings are justified. This action was tried by the learned judge without the intervention of a jury and it was accordingly for him to find both the facts as to the matters which the complainant believed and upon which he relied, and also whether the facts so believed amounted to reasonable cause (Herniman v. Smith4, Lord Atkin at 317).\nWhile it would have been of assistance if the learned trial judge had dealt in somewhat more detail with this aspect of the matter, it appears to me to be clear that he reached the conclusion that Colborne had acted in good faith and that there were reasonable and probable grounds for his laying the charge. The learned judges of the Appellate Division have concurred in that finding.\nThe burden of proving malice of the nature referred to by Bowen L.J. rested upon the plaintiff and while the learned trial judge does not deal with this aspect of the matter in terms, it appears to me implicit in the reasons given that he found against the appellant on this issue. I consider that the reasons delivered by Kane J.A. are also to be construed as finding against the appellant on that issue. My consideration of the very lengthy evidence in this case leads me to the conclusion that there are no grounds upon which we may properly interfere with the judgment appealed from upon either of these issues.\nAs to the claim advanced against the respondent Christen-son for allegedly giving false evidence at the preliminary hearing and doing so maliciously, there is no finding in either of the courts below and the matter not having been argued before us should, in my opinion, be considered as abandoned.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nCartwright J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Locke and wish to add only a few words.\nIn the brief oral reasons of the Appellate Division delivered by Kane J.A. there is the following statement:\nAs to Sergeant Paley, the respondents cannot be held liable for his shortcomings, if in fact there were any shortcomings.\nOn reading the reasons as a whole, I think it clear that the sentence quoted has reference only to the argument that the existence of malice on the part of the respondents should have been inferred from lack of care in the investigation which preceded the laying of the information. If it had had reference to the question whether or not the respondents had reasonable and probable cause for laying the information it is my present view that I would disagree with it; but as I am satisfied that it does not have reference to that question I do not pursue the matter further.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Locke.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Main, Dunne, Nugent & Forbes, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Duncan, Miskew, Dechene, Bowen, Craig & Brosseau, Edmonton.\n1 (1883), 11 Q.B.D. 440 at 455.\n2 [1905] A.C. 168 at 170.\n3 (1870), L.R. 4 H.L. 521.\n4 [1938] A.C. 305, 1 All E.R. 1.\n",

The story of their relationship between the time when the deceased obtained a decree absolute dissolving his first marriage and the time of his death disclosed a consistent and continuing belief in, and assertion of, an existing contract of marriage between them on the part of the plaintiff and a consistent attitude of procrastination on the part of the deceased. The trial judge held that the deceased's refusal to marry the plaintiff and also his subsequent continued delay to so marry amounted to breach of promise. The defendants' appeal from that judgment was dismissed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta and a further appeal was brought to this Court. The defendants contended that the marriage was still in contemplation on the day the deceased was killed and that there was then an existing contract outstanding between the parties which was brought to an end by the deceased's death. The plaintiff contended that there was a breach of contract during the deceased's lifetime, giving rise to a cause of action against his executors.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThere were findings of fact by the trial judge that the deceased had renewed his promise of marriage, that he indicated his intention of carrying it out and that up to the date of his death no repudiation of this promise was ever communicated by him to the plaintiff. Repudiation of a contract is not to be readily inferred in the case of a promisor who reiterates his intention to carry out his promise and whose conduct, however inconsistent with his intention it may appear to be, has at no time had the effect of communicating such a repudiation to the promissee. Mersey Steel and Iron Co. v. Naylor, Benzon & Co. (1884), 9 App. Cas. 434, considered.\nEven if the deceased's behavior was such as to make it entirely apparent that he never had the slightest intention of marrying the plaintiff, it was nevertheless equally clear from the evidence that the plaintiff never accepted his conduct as meaning any such thing, and that notwithstanding his repeated delays she insisted on the continued existence of the contract and was at all times ready to carry out her part of it. The effect of the failure to marry on the day named in the written contract had been erased by the subsequent renewal and by the conduct of the parties, and the promise was one of which performance was currently due from day to day. Frost v. Knight (1872), L.R. 7 Exch. 111; Avery v. Bowden (1856), 6 E. & B, 953; Heyman v. Darwins, Ltd., [1942] A.C. 356, considered.\nThe deceased's death was a supervening event not due to his own fault, which brought the contract to an end. Hall v. Wright (1859), E. B. & E. 765; Stubbs (Administrator) v. Holywell Ry. (1867), 2 Exch. 311; Robinson v. Davison (1871), L.R. 6 Exch. 269, applied. The deceased's continued existence was an implied condition of the contract.\nThe plaintiff's alternative plea, that as a result of the deceased's fraudulent misrepresentation she had cohabited with him, was not supported by the evidence. The deceased's conduct was at least as consistent with honest procrastination as it was with fraudulent misrepresentation, and that of the plaintiff suggested that she was prepared to cohabit in constant expectation of marriage.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, affirming a judgment of Cairns J. in an action for breach of promise of marriage. Appeal allowed.\nT. Mayson, for the defendants, appellants.\nMacDonald Millard, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta insofar as it affirmed those portions of a judgment of Mr. Justice Cairns which ordered that the respondent recover $10,000 from the appellants for breach of promise of marriage and that all the furniture and furnishings in a house at 4750 55th Street, Red Deer, Alberta, belonged to the respondent with the exception of one chesterfield, two chairs and one bed. The appellants also appeal from the Orders as to costs in the Courts below.\nThe appellants are the executors of the will of Alfred Edward McBride who was killed in an automobile accident on February 28, 1959, and who, at the time of his death, was living at Red Deer aforesaid in the same house with the respondent and holding her out as his wife to at least some other members of the community although they were not married.\nThe story of the relationship between the respondent and McBride between September 18, 1952, when he obtained a decree absolute dissolving his first marriage and the time of his death discloses a consistent and continuing belief in, and assertion of, an existing contract of marriage between them on the part of the respondent and a consistent attitude of procrastination on the part of McBride. The respondent's evidence which is uncontradicted is that the couple became engaged to be married in 1953 at which time she was 51 years of age and her fianc\u00e9 54. Pursuant to this engagement, she says that they went together on a trip to Idaho in July 1954 for the purpose of getting married, but unfortunately the day which they selected for the ceremony was July 4, and as this was a public holiday they were unable to get blood tests, and so decided that they \"would go on to Coulee Dam and come back and get married another day\". At this stage there was apparently a quarrel, as a result of which McBride refused to go through with the wedding, and they returned to Red Deer. Shortly after returning home, a contract was prepared by the respondent, signed by both her and McBride and duly witnessed which read as follows:\nI, Alfred Edward McBride & I Dorothy Barbara Johnson the under-signed do solemnly promise that on the 15th day of July, 1954 shall marry each other.\nBoth of us being of sound mind do declare this covenant. No bills or debts of the other are either of our responsibility. Fat shall do his own business & I shall obey & mind my own.\nWhen July 15 came, the respondent says that McBride \"wanted a little more time, and he thought that we would wait until he had time that we could go away again\". In preparation for the marriage, the couple went to a clinic and had their blood tests taken on August 19, and the necessary form in this regard, pursuant to The Solemnization of Marriage Act, was duly completed by a physician. This initial step having been completed, the respondent says that they \"started making preparations to have a honeymoon and go away and get married\", and finally in September McBride \"booked off\" some time from his work and they proceeded to the Court House at Red Deer for the purpose of getting a marriage licence, but when they got there it appeared that McBride did not have \"a certificate of no appeal\" from the Clerk of the Court in Edmonton where he had obtained his divorce without which certificate a marriage licence could not be obtained. McBride was \"quite angry\" and seemed to think that \"he had paid enough already for a divorce without having to pay any more\" and he refused to get the required certificate, but as he was all packed and he had his time \"booked off\" the couple decided to go for \"a honeymoon\" anyway; they proceeded on a trip to the States and on their return the respondent moved in to the house where McBride was living and where she had been keeping house for him, although she had been living elsewhere. She says of this move:\nWe were going to get married as soon as we had the furniture and things moved in, and were preparing to get the certificate from Edmonton, he said that when he went up he would go to the Court House and get it.\nand again:\nA. Yes, he refused to marry me on the 15th of July when he wouldn't get his certificate, when he postponed the marriage until later on.\nQ. But whatever happened then, you moved in with him later, didn't you?\nA. I had no alternative but to move in with the promise I would be married when we got our house straightened up.\nThe furniture which was moved was found by the learned trial judge to be the property of the respondent, but in ordering that \"all of the furniture and furnishings in the house \u2026 belong to the Plaintiff with the exception of 1 chesterfield, 2 chairs and 1 bed, \u2026.\" he included a stove, a television set and a refrigerator which had been purchased by McBride and which the appellants now claim to have been his property.\nFrom the time of the move in September 1954 until McBride's death he and the respondent appear to have lived happily with each other and to have gone on holidays together. The respondent produced some valentine cards, letters and a photograph indicating that McBride's affection for her continued over the years and in 1957 she adopted her own granddaughter, a child of two years, of whom she says: \"I took this child to raise because we loved her and she brought a great deal of comfort and happiness into the home of the deceased and myself.\" There is evidence that except when McBride was not sober he treated her well, and she says, \"He led me to believe that he was going to marry me at all times\". The following exchange occurred on the cross-examination of the respondent:\nQ. And he never repudiated his agreement, did he?\nA. He never repudiated his agreement, no.\nQ. And he never said anything to you to lead you to believe that he was misleading you in any way?\nA. No.\nQ. And he continued his promise right up to the time of his death didn't he?\nA. That's right, Mr. Mayson. In support of the argument that McBride did not intend to marry the respondent after September 1954, counsel laid great stress on the fact that he made no provision for her in the will which he made in 1956, but in my view this falls into the same category as the evidence to the effect that the respondent would have lost her widow's pension of $90 a month if she had married. Both are circumstances from which inferences could be drawn but neither is of sufficient weight to support a conclusion as to the intention of the parties.\nIt is contended on behalf of the appellants that on February 28, 1959, the marriage was still in contemplation and that there was then an existing contract outstanding between the parties which was brought to an end by McBride's death on that date. The respondent, on the other hand, contends that there was a breach of the contract during McBride's lifetime, giving rise to a cause of action against his executors.\nIf there had been a breach of the contract during McBride's lifetime, it is not disputed that in accordance with the decision of this Court in Smallman v. Moore1, an action could be maintained against his executors. That was an action brought against the administrator of a deceased promisor and the jury had expressly found that the deceased was in breach of his promise to marry and that the parties had not afterwards agreed to a postponement of the marriage. As to the contention that such an action could not be brought against the administrator, Mr. Justice Locke said:\nThat the breach of a contract of this nature is a mere personal wrong is \u2026 concluded by authority: the injury occasioned is a personal injury to the plaintiff. Such an injury is \u2026 a wrong to the plaintiff \"in respect of his person\" within the meaning of the section [s. 37(2) of the Trustee Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 165] whether it results from a breach of contract or is occasioned by a tort.\nAlthough these observations were directed to the Ontario Trustee Act, supra, they apply with equal force in my opinion to the equivalent provision of the Alberta Trustee Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 346, which reads as follows:\n33. (1) Where any deceased person committed a wrong to another in respect of his person or of his real or personal property, except in cases of libel and slander, the person so wronged may maintain an action against the executors or administrators of the deceased person who committed the wrong. In the present case, however, it is contended on behalf of the appellants that there had been no breach of McBride's promise, that the respondent never recognized any repudiation by him being at all times ready, willing and anxious to carry out her part of the bargain, and that the obligations incidental to such a promise must, in the nature of things, be brought to an end by the death of the promisor.\nThe following paragraph in the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge contains the essence of his finding on this branch of the case, and as the Appellate Division gave no reasons for dismissing the appeal these observations must be taken to have been adopted by that Court:\nThe plaintiff was very frank to say that he intended to marry her as far as she knew to the date of his death and there is no doubt that he indicated this to her, but I am completely convinced from all of the evidence, excluding certain hearsay evidence at the trial, on which point I have considerable doubt, that he never had the slightest intention of marrying her after September, 1954, even though he did indicate his good intentions to her to such an extent that he convinced her of his sincerity. In my view, a breach of the contract occurred in 1954 when he refused to marry her and that breach continued until his death in spite of his protestations of love for her and his good intentions. Even though he did heal the breach as far as she was concerned, to some extent, by promises of marriage later, to the extent that he deceived her completely, his continued delay of four and a half years, in my view, also amounts to a breach of his contract, and that prior to his death he had completely repudiated his contract, if not expressly, at least by his conduct although this had not been communicated to the plaintiff. McBride had a scheme to maintain the status quo without incurring the obligations incident to marriage. There is no doubt that where the breach occurred prior to the death, a cause of action for breach of promise of marriage will lie against the representatives. Smallman v. Moore, [1948] S.C.R. 295.\nThis statement is a long way from the clear-cut findings of fact made by the jury in Smallman v. Moore, supra, and the analysis of what was passing through McBride's mind over the years must be based almost entirely on inference. There are nevertheless included in this forceful expression of the learned trial judge's deductions certain findings of fact which are directly supported by the respondent's evidence, namely, that McBride renewed his promise of marriage after September 1954, that he indicated his intention of carrying it out, and that up to the date of his death no repudiation of this promise was ever communicated to the respondent by him.\nThese findings of fact standing alone support the contention that McBride at no time repudiated the promise of marriage which he made after September 1954. Repudiation of a contract is not to be readily inferred in the case of a promisor who reiterates his intention to carry out his promise and whose conduct, however inconsistent with this intention it may appear to be, has at no time had the effect of communicating such repudiation to the promisee. The nature of the conduct which would justify an inference of repudiation is discussed by Lord Selborne in the case of Mersey Steel and Iron Co. v. Naylor, Benzon & Co.2, where he says at pp. 442\u2013443:\nYou must look at the actual circumstances of the case in order to see whether the one party to the contract is relieved from its future performance by the conduct of the other; you must examine what that conduct is so as to see whether it amounts to a renunciation, to an absolute refusal to perform the contract \u2026 and whether the other party may accept it as a reason for not performing his part.\nEven if it is accepted, however, that McBride's behaviour was such as to make it entirely apparent that he never had the slightest intention of marrying her, it is nevertheless equally clear from the evidence that the respondent never accepted his conduct as meaning any such thing, and that notwithstanding his repeated delays she insisted on the continued existence of the contract and was at all times ready to carry out her part of it.\nIn delivering his well-known decision in Frost v. Knight3, Cockburn C.J. was concerned with the repudiation of a promise to marry before the date due for fulfilment had arrived. The contract in that case was not to be performed until the death of the promisor's father, but the promise had been withdrawn during his lifetime. Under these circumstances, Cockburn C.J. said at pp. 112\u2013113:\nThe promisee, if he pleases, may treat the notice of intention as inoperative, and await the time when the contract is to be executed, and then hold the other party responsible for all the consequences of nonperformance; but in that case he keeps the contract alive for the benefit of the other party as well as his own; He remains subject to all his own obligations and liabilities under it, and enables the other party not only to complete the contract, if so advised, notwithstanding his previous repudiation of it, but also to take advantage of any supervening circumstance which would justify him in declining to complete it.\nOn the other hand, the promisee may, if he thinks proper, treat the repudiation of the other party as a wrongful putting an end to the contract, and may at once bring his action as on a breach of it; and in such action he will be entitled to such damages as would have arisen from the nonperformance of the contract at the appointed time, subject, however, to abatement in respect of any circumstances which may have afforded him the means of mitigating his loss.\nThe present case, however, is not one in which performance was conditional on the happening of some future event nor is it one of repudiation prior to the time fixed for performance. The effect of the failure to marry on the day-named in the written contract had been erased by the subsequent renewal and by the conduct of the parties, and the promise was one of which performance was currently due from day to day.\nBefore the decision in Frost v. Knight, supra, it had been decided in Avery v. Bowden4, that if in a contract which involved the loading of cargo within a certain number of days the party required to load had positively informed the ship's captain that no cargo was to be loaded, then the captain might have treated this as a breach and renunciation of the contract and have sailed away, whereupon he would have had the right to maintain an action on the contract. On the other hand, if he continued to insist upon having a cargo in fulfilment of the contract, the renunciation could not be considered as constituting a cause of action and a declaration of war before the expiration of the period fixed for loading would have brought the contract to an end. The effect of the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench in this case is well summarized in the head-note to the proceedings which affirmed it in the Exchequer Chamber, supra. It is there said:\nHeld, by the Court of Queen's Bench, that, assuming that the defendant's agent had on his part renounced the contract before the declaration of war, such renunciation, not being accepted by the master, constituted neither a dispensation nor cause of action. (The italics are mine.)\nThis case has come to be taken as a precedent for the proposition which is clearly and authoritatively stated by Viscount Simon in Heyman v. Darwins, Limited5, where he says:\nIf one party so acts or so expresses himself, as to show that he does not mean to accept and discharge the obligations of a contract any further, the other party has an option as to the attitude 'he may take up. He may, notwithstanding the so-called repudiation, insist on holding his co-contractor to the bargain, and continue to tender due performance on his part. In that event, the co-contractor has the opportunity of withdrawing from his false position, and even if he does not, may escape ultimate liability because of some supervening event not due to his own fault which excuses or puts an end to further performance: a classic example of this is to be found in Avery v. Bowden (1855) 5 E. & B. 714. Alternatively, the other party may rescind the contract, or (as it is sometimes expressed) \"accept the repudiation\", by so acting as to make plain that in view of the wrongful action of the party who has repudiated, he claims to treat the contract as at an end, in which case he can sue at once for damages.\nIn the present case there was ample evidence that the respondent was insisting on holding McBride to his bargain and that she was continuing until the day of his death to tender due performance of her part of the contract.\nWhether or not McBride's conduct amounted to an absolute refusal to perform his contract so as to give the respondent the right to sue for damages, the respondent's conduct in my opinion had the effect of keeping the contract alive, and the only remaining question is whether McBride's death was a supervening event not due to his own fault which brought it to an end. In my opinion it undoubtedly was.\nIn the case of Hall v. Wright6, which was an action for breach of promise of marriage, the defendant who suffered from severe bleeding from his lungs pleaded that he was incapable of marriage without great danger to his own life. There was a strong difference of opinion between the judges of the Exchequer Court as to the validity of this defence, and although the majority, for varying reasons, held that the plea was bad, none dissented from the view expressed by Pollock C.B. that:\nIn the case of the ordinary contract to marry, such as it is presented to the Court by evidence in actions of this sort, I think no one can doubt that the continuance of life is an implied condition.\nThis reasoning was applied to the case of a contract of personal service in Stubbs (Administrator) v. Holywell Railway Company7, where Martin B. said:\nThe contract, no doubt, is ended by the death of Stubbs, but only in this sense, that the act of God has made further performance impossible. The man's life was an implied condition of the contract, but the fact of his death can have nothing whatever to do with the payment due for what has been done\u2014with what has been actually earned by the deceased. In the case of Robinson v. Davison8, Kelly B. adopted the following language used by Pollock C.B. in Hall v. Wright, supra:\nAll contracts for personal services which can be performed only during the lifetime of the party contracting are subject to the implied condition that he shall be alive to perform them: and, should he die, his executor is not liable to an action for the breach of contract occasioned by his death.\nIt seems to me to be obvious that McBride's continued existence was an implied condition of the contract in the present case and that the contract ended with his death.\nThere is included in the Statement of Claim the following alternative plea:\nIn the alternative the Plaintiff states that the said Alfred Edward McBride, deceased, fraudulently misrepresented to her that he intended at all times to marry her from the date that he entered into the said Agreement until the date of his death, and that as a result of the said misrepresentation and the fraud which he perpetrated on her, she took up residence in the said premises and kept house for the said Alfred Edward McBride and accepted the responsibilities which she would not otherwise have undertaken and was entirely misled by the representations made by the said Alfred Edward McBride, deceased.\nI do not find it necessary to deal with the arguments presented concerning this plea because, with all respect to the learned trial judge, I do not think that it is supported by the evidence. The respondent was the mother of six grown-up children by her first husband and had been a nurse at a provincial training centre, she had known McBride for fifteen years, been engaged to him for six years and had lived with him for the last five years of his life, and I am, with respect, unable to accept as probable the inference that such an experienced woman could be completely deceived from day to day as to the meaning of the words and actions of a man with whom she had been so intimate for so long a time concerning a subject of such vital importance to them both. In my view, McBride's conduct as disclosed by the evidence is at least as consistent with honest procrastination as it is with fraudulent misrepresentation and that of the respondent suggests that although she was apparently ready to put up with the loose arrangement of cohabitation without marriage on a temporary basis, she was in constant expectation of the relationship being regularized by McBride carrying out his continuing promise of marriage which remained unfulfilled and unreleased at his death. As has been indicated, the appellants appeal also from that part of the Order of the learned trial judge which awarded a stove, television set and a refrigerator to the respondent. The respondent says that she bought the stove with the house, and as there is no appeal from the finding that she had no interest in the house, I am, with respect, unable to see any ground for declaring that the stove is her property. The television set and refrigerator were purchased by McBride, and although the respondent states that they were both given to her, there is no corroboration of this evidence as required by s. 13 of the Alberta Evidence Act, R.S.A, 1955, c. 101, and as there is no presumption of a gift under the circumstances here disclosed I do not think there is sufficient evidence to justify the award of these items to the respondent.\nOn the evidence I am not satisfied that the learned trial judge was wrong in failing to award damages to the appellants in respect of the respondent's refusal to deliver up the house to them nor do I find any evidence of the appellants having suffered damage by reason of the respondent retaining and using the stove, television set and refrigerator.\nSave as aforesaid, I would allow this appeal and set aside the Order appealed from insofar as it awards $10,000 in damages to the respondent and insofar as it adjudges that the three last-mentioned items to be property belonging to the respondent and accords her the right to remove them. The appellants should have their costs of the claim and counterclaim on the trial and their costs of the appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta and to this Court.\nAppeal allowed with costs throughout.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants: Steer, Dyde, Massie, Layton, Cregan & MacDonnell, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Millard & Johnson, Calgary.\n1 [1948] S.C.R. 295, 3 D.L.R. 657.\n2 (1884), 9 App. Cas. 434, 53 L.J.Q.B. 497.\n3 (1872), L.R. 7 Exch. 111.\n4 (1856), 6 E. & B. 953, 26 L.J.Q.B. 3.\n5 [1942] A.C. 356 at 361, 1 All E.R. 337.\n6 (1859), E.

On the death of the sister, if she left issue by some husband other than R the estate was to go to such issue, but if she left no issue by any husband other than R, the estate was to go to the children of the testator's cousin. After the death of the testator, his sister divorced R and remarried. No children were born of this second marriage but the parties adopted a daughter, who subsequently married and had three children, of whom the two survivors were the appellants. The daughter died in the lifetime of her adoptive mother, the life tenant. The dispute was whether the appellants, the children of an adopted child who died in 1936, became the issue of the testator's sister by any other husband than R by virtue of the 1958 amendment to the Ontario Child Welfare Act, which came into effect on January 1, 1959, and was in force on the date of the death of the life tenant on January 1, 1960. The trial judge ruled against the appellants and his judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. A further appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Judson and Ritchie JJ.: Section 74 of The Child Welfare Act, as enacted by 1958 (Ont.), c. 11, made the legal relationship of an adopted child and an adopting parent the same as that of parent and child in a lawful marriage. S. 75, which provided that persons \"heretofore adopted \u2026 shall for all purposes \u2026 be governed by\" Part IV of the Act, could have no effect upon the legal relationship or status of an adopted child who died in the year 1936. On January 1, 1959, when s. 75 came into effect, she was not a person heretofore adopted under the laws of Ontario to whom the section could apply. Accordingly, the section did not operate to make the appellants issue of the testator's sister by a husband other than R.\nAt the date of the death of the adopted child the legislation in force was The Adoption Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 189. Under the provisions of s. 5(2) and (6) thereof, the adopted child was not a child of the testator's sister for the purposes of this will. It was only under a will made by the sister and only then if the other conditions of that section were met that the adopted child or issue of that child could so qualify.\nPer Locke J.: The clear meaning of paragraphs 3 and 4 of the will was that, unless upon the death of the testator's sister she left surviving a child or children born of her body by a husband other than her then husband R, the estate was to be divided as directed by paragraph 3. There were no such children. The adopted daughter was not born of the body of the testator's sister and, accordingly, the former, if living, could have no claim and her children have none.\nPer Cartwright J.: Sections 74 and 75 of The Child Welfare Act did not have the effect of making the appellants issue of the testator's sister by a husband other than R within the meaning of the words of the testator's will. As to the effect of these sections upon the distribution of the estate of a testator who died prior to their enactment vide Re Gage, Ketterer et at. v. Griffith et al., infra, at p. 241.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, from a judgment of Stewart J. on a motion for construction of a will. Appeal dismissed.\nW. B. Williston, Q.C., and I. A. McEwan, for the appellants.\nTerence Sheard, Q.C., and A. H. Bobby, Q.C., for the respondents.\nM. G. Kneale, Q.C., for the executors of the estate of Joseph Kendall Clement.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014The issue in this appeal is the effect of The Child Welfare Amendment Act, 1958 (Ont.), c. 11, upon the right of the two appellants, who are children of an adopted child who is now dead, to take under the will of a stranger which was executed and came into effect long before there was any legal adoption in Ontario. The judgment of the Court of Appeal2 is that they cannot take under this will. The testator, Joseph Kendall Clement, died in 1904. He left a life interest in his estate to his sister, Edith Maud Ritchie, so long as she should remain separated from her then husband, Dr. Ritchie of Warren, Ohio. On the death of the sister, if she left issue by some husband other than Dr. Ritchie the estate was to go to such issue. But if she left no issue by any husband other than Dr. Ritchie, the estate was to go to the children of the testator's cousin, Charles Alexander Montgomery. After the death of the testator, his sister divorced Dr. Ritchie and, in 1911, she married Garfield Bruce Gordon. No children were born of this marriage but in 1924 Mr. and Mrs. Gordon adopted one Margaret Jukes Watson pursuant to an order made under The Adoption Act of the Province of Ontario. In 1931 Margaret Jukes Gordon married Frank Kenneth Gardner and had three children, two of whom still survive and are the present appellants. The adopted child, Margaret Jukes Gardner, died in 1936. The life tenant, Mrs. Edith Maud Gordon, the sister of the testator, survived until January 1, 1960.\nMore precisely, therefore, the dispute is whether the two appellants, John Bruce Gardner and Russell Gordon Gardner, the children of an adopted child who died in 1936, became the issue of the testator's sister by \"any other husband than the said Dr. Ritchie\" by virtue of the 1958 amendment to The Child Welfare Act which came into effect on January 1, 1959, and was in force on the date of the death of the life tenant on January 1, 1960.\nThe two relevant sections of The Child Welfare Act of 1958 are ss. 74 and 75 and read as follows:\n74. (1) For all purposes the adopted child, upon the adoption order being made, becomes the child of the adopting parent and the adopting parent becomes the parent of the adopted child as if the adopted child had been born in lawful wedlock to the adopting parent.\n(2) For all purposes the adopted child, upon the adoption order being made, ceases to be the child of the person who was his parent before the adoption order was made and that person ceases to be the parent of the adopted child.\n(3) The relationship to one another of all persons, whether the adopted child, the adopting parent, the kindred of the adopting parent, the parent before the making of the adoption order and the kindred of that parent or any other person, shall be determined in accordance with subsections 1 and 2.\n(4) Subsections 2 and 3 do not apply for the purposes of the laws relating to incest and the prohibited degrees of marriage to remove any person from a relationship in consanguinity which, but for this section, would have existed. 75. Every person heretofore adopted under the laws of Ontario and every person adopted under the laws of any other province or territory of Canada or under the laws of any other country shall for all purposes in Ontario be governed by this Part.\nSection 74 is a radical departure from any previous adoption legislation in the Province of Ontario in that it states the position of the adopted child and the adopting parent in broad general terms in order to make the legal relationship the same as that of parent and child in a lawful marriage. Prior legislation in Ontario had attempted to define the rights and obligations of the two, and only to the extent of the definition was the relationship analogous to that of parent and child. Section 75 is also new and the difficulty here is whether it has any application to the appellants on January 1, 1960, when their mother, the adopted child of 1924, had died in 1936.\nIn my opinion, s. 75 can have no effect upon the legal relationship or status of an adopted child who died in the year 1936. On January 1, 1959, when s. 75 came into effect, she was not a person heretofore adopted under the laws of Ontario to whom the section could apply.\nStewart J. held that the appellants' claim failed for two reasons. The first was that \"issue by any other husband than the said Dr. Ritchie\" meant children and not grandchildren and that the children must be born of a second marriage. The second was that the 1958 legislation only applied to adopted children who were living on January 1,1959. In the Court of Appeal, the Chief Justice, with MacKay J.A. concurring, decided that in this will the prima facie meaning of issue as including descendants of every degree was displaced because the reference to parentage of the issue restricted the meaning to children and that the rule in Sibley v. Perry3, applied. The majority, therefore, agreed in part with Stewart J. on the first point and did not find it necessary to consider s. 75. However, Lebel J.A. held that as a matter of construction, \"issue\" included descendants of every degree but he did adopt the conclusion of Stewart J. that s. 75 did not apply to an adopted child who had died before the section came into force.\nIt is unnecessary to decide which construction of the will should be adopted. An insuperable obstacle in the way of the appellants is that s. 75 does not operate to make them issue of the testator's sister by a husband other than Dr. Ritchie. It does not confer a posthumous status upon their mother, the adopted child of the testator's sister. At the time of her death she was not a child for all purposes and on January 1, 1959, being dead, she was not a person heretofore adopted under the laws of Ontario \"who shall for all purposes in Ontario be governed by this Part.\" Consequently, her children do not qualify under the will as issue of the second marriage.\nAt the date of the death of the adopted child in this case, May 30,1936, the legislation in force was The Adoption Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 189. Section 5(2) of that Act gave the adopted child the same rights of intestate succession as a child born of a marriage, but rights under a will were confined to rights arising under a will made by the adopting parent after the making of the adoption order. The precise words are:\nand the expressions \"child\", \"children\" and \"issue\" where used in any disposition made after the making of an adoption order by an adopting parent, shall, unless a contrary intention appears, include an adopted child or children or the issue of an adopted child.\nSubsection (6) of the same section provided:\nSave as herein provided and as to persons other than the adopting parent, the adopted child shall not be deemed the child of the adopting parent.\nUnder this legislation, the adopted child was not a child of the testator's sister for the purposes of this will. It was only under a will made by the testator's sister and only then if the other conditions of the section were met that the adopted child or issue of that child could so qualify.\nThe legislation on this point was continued unchanged in R.S.O. 1937, c. 218, by s. 6(3) and s. 6(7), and in R.S.O. 1950, c. 7, by s. 12(3) and s. 12(7). In 1954 The Adoption Act was repealed and the provisions as to adoption were made Part IV of The Child Welfare Act, 1954 (Ont.), c. 8. In 1958 Part IV of The Child Welfare Act of 1954 was repealed and a new Part IV was enacted by Statutes of Ontario 1958, c. 11, from which ss. 74 and 75 are set out in full in these reasons and are the sections under consideration in this appeal. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nLocke J.:\u2014The will of the late Joseph Kendall Clement which is the subject matter of these proceedings, after appointing his sister Edith Maud as one of the executors and trustees, reads in part:\n3. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 During the life time of my said sister she shall be entitled to the whole income of my estate after payment thereout of all necessary expenses in the maintenance and management thereof and the legacy aforesaid, provided that she continues to live entirely separate from' and have no communication of any kind with her present husband Dr. Ritchie of Warren, Ohio. Upon the death of my said sister without leaving any issue by any other husband than the said Dr. Ritchie or upon her failure to comply with the conditions hereinbefore mentioned regarding her said husband (in which event she shall forfeit all further right and title as executor and trustee of my estate, and the same shall vest exclusively in my other executor and trustee) the whole of my estate shall be held in trust for the child or children of my cousin Charles Alexander Montgomery of Brantford in equal shares.\n4. In the event of my said sister leaving issue by some other husband than the said Dr. Ritchie then the whole of my estate shall be held in trust for such issue to be equally divided among them share and share alike.\nIn my opinion the clear meaning of this language is that, unless upon the death of the sister she left surviving a child or children born of her body by a husband other than her then husband Dr. Ritchie, the estate was to be divided as directed by paragraph 3.\nThere were no such children. The adopted daughter, Margaret Jukes Gordon, was not born of the body of Edith Maud Gordon and, accordingly, she, if living, could have no claim and her children have none.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nCartwright J.:\u2014I agree with the conclusion of my brother Judson that sections 74 and 75 of The Child Welfare Act as enacted by 1958 (Ont.), c. 11, s. 3, do not have the effect of making the appellants issue of the testator's sister by a husband other than Dr. Ritchie within the meaning of the words of the testator's will.\nI express no opinion as to whether as a matter of construction the word \"issue\" as used in the will includes descendants of every degree.\nI have stated my views as to the effect of the sections mentioned above upon the distribution of the estate of a testator who died prior to their enactment in the case of Re Gage, Ketterer et al. v. Griffith et al.1, judgment in which is being delivered at the same time as that in this appeal and I refrain from repeating them.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the applicants, appellants: Fasken, Robertson, Aitchison, Pickup & Calvin, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondents Gardner, Hagey, et al.: Trepanier, Hagey, Kneale & Wiacek, Brantford.\nSolicitors for the respondents Bixel, Montgomery, et al.: Bobby, Ryerson, Houlding & Clarke, Brantford.\n1 (1961), 25 D.L.R.

M died on October 25, 1959, survived by three adopted daughters. S. 74 of The Child Welfare Act, as enacted by 1958 (Ont.), c. 11, made an adopted child a child for all purposes. On an originating motion for the opinion, advice and direction of the Court, the trial judge held that the fund was divisible among and should be paid in equal shares to M\u2019s adopted children. The Court of Appeal in reversing that judgment held that the daughters could not take because they were adopted children and that the share from which M was drawing income must go over to other interests in accordance with the terms of the will as though she had died leaving no child her surviving. In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, the legislature in passing ss. 74 and 75 of The Child Welfare Act, thereby defining the status of adopted children, did not, in addition, intend to interfere with the disposition of an estate made by a testator who had died prior to the passing of the legislation. Also, the legislation was not to be construed as interfering with existing property rights in the absence of clear words showing such an intention. The adopted daughters appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Judson and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Locke and Cartwright JJ.: The question before the Court was not whether the three appellants had for all purposes the status of children born in lawful wedlock to M; it was rather whether on the true construction of the language used by the testator in his will he intended that in the events that had happened they should take as beneficiaries. For the reasons given by the Court below, as a matter of construction, the words \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d as used in the testator\u2019s will did not include the appellants. Re Blackwell, [1959] O.R. 377, overruled.\nPer Judson and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: The class of children who were to take the remainder could not be ascertained until the death of the life tenant and, in the meantime, legislation had intervened to change the meaning of the word \u201cchildren\u201d and to make the appellants into \u201cchildren\u201d. The meaning of the word in the will could not be considered apart from the statute.\nThe legislation must be applied to a state of facts as it exists at the time when the class of children is to be ascertained in order to determine who are children. Where this is the problem, and in the absence of any proviso limiting the application of the legislation, there is no basis for rejection of its application to wills made before its enactment, whether or not adoption was known to the law at the time of the execution of the will.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing a judgment of Spence J., declaring that certain adopted children were entitled to share in a bequest to \u201cchildren\u201d by virtue of ss. 74 and 75 of The Child Welfare Act (Ont.).

Love and Wilhelmina Horsfall.\nTerence Sheard, Q.C., for the respondent, Chartered Trust Company.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014I agree with Roach J.A., speaking on behalf of the Court of Appeal1, and he has dealt with the matter so satisfactorily I have nothing to add.\nThe appeal should be dismissed but the costs of all parties in this Court should be paid out of the fund in question, those of the trustee as between solicitor and client.\nThe judgment of Locke and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The relevant facts and the question raised for decision in this appeal are set out in the reasons of my brother Judson.\nWe have to decide whether the view of the effect of ss. 74 and 75 of The Child Welfare Act, as enacted by 1958 (Ont.), c. 11, s. 3 (now ss. 76 and 77 of The Child Welfare Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 53) expressed by McRuer C.J.H.C. in Re Blackwell[2], or that of the unanimous Court of Appeal1 expressed by Roach J.A. in the case at bar is the right one.\nThis appeal was argued immediately after that in the case of Re Clement[3] judgment in which is being given at the same time as this judgment. Counsel in this appeal adopted the arguments of counsel in the Clement case whose interests were similar to their own and in addition assisted us with further full and helpful argument.\nI agree with the reasons and conclusion of Roach J.A. and wish in particular to adopt the following passages in his reasons:\nNo legislation will be construed as thwarting the intention of a testator as expressed in his will, unless the language clearly and unmistakably indicates that the legislature so intended and has effectively brought about that result.\nHaving quoted the two sections referred to above the learned Justice of Appeal continued:\nThose sections make the status of adopted children, whether adopted prior or subsequent to the passing thereof, that of natural born children of the adopting parents. The question here, however, is not one of status but of the intention of the testator. In a case of intestacy certainly the status of the adopted children is the governing factor. As I earlier stated, we know without any doubt what the intention of the testator was. The only debatable question here is,\u2014What was the intention of the legislature in passing those two sections? Did it intend thereby, in addition to defining the status of adopted children, to interfere with the disposition of an estate made by a testator who had died prior to the passing of the legislation. Having stated that question, I answer it at once by saying that in my respectful opinion the legislature did not so intend.\n* * *\nIf the 1958 Act is to be construed as entitling the adopted children of Mrs. McCormack to share in this estate, then it means that the legislature has taken from the grandchildren by blood relationship of the testator property rights which he gave exclusively to them and given them to other persons who now, by virtue of the statute, stand in the relationship of grandchildren to the testator but whom he didn\u2019t even think of and assuredly had no intention of benefiting.\nIn my respectful opinion, plainer and more explicit language than is contained in the legislation here in question is necessary to impel the court to reach the conclusion that the legislature intended that result. That result would be tantamount to confiscation by the state and distribution by the state, of the property confiscated, to a class. It is a basic principle of interpretation that the court always leans against any interpretation of a statute as authorizing confiscation. Maxwell, 9th ed., p. 289-90. I think it makes no difference that the property confiscated is not retained by the state but is given, after confiscation, to other persons.\nAt the risk of repetition of what has already been said by Roach J.A. I propose to add only a few words.\nThe question before us is not whether the three appellants have for all purposes the status of children born in lawful wedlock to the late Mrs. McCormack; it is rather whether on the true construction of the language used by the testator in his will he intended that, in the events that have happened, they should take as beneficiaries.\nIn the course of the argument the question was put to counsel from the bench whether the testator could by the use of apt words have excluded the appellants from any share in his estate, the form of words suggested being: \u201cWhenever in this will I use the expression \u2018child\u2019 or \u2018children\u2019 I mean a child or children actually born in lawful wedlock of the body of the parent of such child and I do not mean an adopted child\u201d. All counsel answered that such a form of words would effectively have excluded the appellants. I would not found my judgment on the answer of counsel to such a question put during the course of argument if I thought that any other answer were possible, but in my opinion no other answer could be made. Once it appears that in spite of the terms of the sections of The Child Welfare Act referred to above a testator can by apt language exclude from his bounty, whether as individuals or as members of a class, children who have been adopted in favour of issue immediate or remote of his own body or of the body of a designated person, it seems to me that the question of the status of such adopted children becomes irrelevant and the only question is:\u2014\u201cWhat do the words of the testator\u2019s will mean?\u201d For the reasons given by Roach J.A. I agree that, as a matter of construction, those words do not include the appellants.\nI would dismiss the appeal and would direct that the costs of all parties in this Court should be paid out of the fund in question those of the trustee on a solicitor and client basis.\nThe judgment of Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J. (dissenting):\u2014The appellants are three adopted daughters of the late Gladys McCormack, who died on October 25, 1959, after the amendment to Part IV of The Child Welfare Act by 1958 (Ont.), c. 11, had come into force. The question in the appeal is whether they can take under the will of Sir William Gage as children of his daughter Gladys McCormack.\nGladys McCormack had a life interest in one-quarter of the residue of the estate of her father, whose will provided that on her death that part of the residue from which she had been drawing the income should be held in trust for her children until the youngest reached the age of 21, when it was to be divided among the children equally. The judgment under appeal holds that the appellants cannot take because they are adopted children and that the share from which Gladys McCormack was drawing income must go over to other interests in accordance with the terms of the will as though she had died leaving no child her surviving.\nSir William Gage made his will on May 5, 1920, and died on January 14, 1921. This was before there was any adoption legislation in the Province of Ontario. The first Adoption Act in Ontario came into force on April 18, 1921. Mrs. McCormack adopted Mary Joy Ketterer on January 2, 1930, and Mazo Marie Ireland and Davidiana Gadsby on January 24, 1944. On January 1, 1959, the Ontario legislation making an adopted child a child for all purposes came into force and on October 25, 1959, Gladys McCormack died leaving these three adopted daughters surviving her.\nThe question therefore is precisely the same as the one raised in Re Blackwell[4], that is, the right of adopted children to take as a class answering the description of children when the life tenant dies after the coming into force of the 1958 legislation. The judgment in Re Blackwell held that after January 1, 1959, adopted children were children for all purposes and that when the class of children was ascertained on the death of the life tenant, adopted children would take as children. This judgment was not appealed. Consequently, when this application came before Spence J., he held himself bound to follow it. On appeal, however, the judgment of Spence J. was reversed[5], the Court of Appeal holding that these adopted children could not take as children and that the part of the residue from which Mrs. McCormack was drawing income must go over to the other interests designated in the will.\nIf these adopted children are to succeed, it must be because of the 1958 amendment to The Child Welfare Act. Sections 74 and 75 of this Act are:\n74. (1) For all purposes the adopted child, upon the adoption order being made, becomes the child of the adopting parent and the adopting parent becomes the parent of the adopted child as if the adopted child had been born in lawful wedlock to the adopting parent.\n(2) For all purposes the adopted child, upon the adoption order being made, ceases to be the child of the person who was his parent before the adoption order was made and that person ceases to be the parent of the adopted child.\n(3) The relationship to one another of all persons, whether the adopted child, the adopting parent, the kindred of the adopting parent, the parent before the making of the adoption order and the kindred of that parent or any other person, shall be determined in accordance with subsections 1 and 2.\n(4) Subsections 2 and 3 do not apply for the purposes of the laws relating to incest and the prohibited degrees of marriage to remove any person from a relationship in consanguinity which, but for this section, would have existed.\n75. Every person heretofore adopted under the laws of Ontario and every person adopted under the laws of any other province or territory of Canada or under the laws of any other country shall for all purposes in Ontario be governed by this Part. In my reasons for judgment in Re Clement[6], I traced in brief outline the history of adoption legislation in Ontario and its effect upon succession to property. The history is one of a progressive development towards equating the position of an adopted child with that of a natural child. There are three steps in this development. The original legislation of 1921 did no more than confer a right of succession on the intestacy of the adopting parent and provided by s. 12 (1921 (Ont.), c. 55) that the word \u201c\u2018child\u2019 or its equivalent in any instrument shall include an adopted child unless the contrary plainly appears by the terms of the instrument.\u201d\nThe first change of any significance was enacted by 1927 (Ont.), c. 53, s. 6(2). It preserved the right of intestate succession and provided that \u201cthe expressions \u2018child\u2019, \u2018children\u2019 and \u2018issue\u2019 where used in any disposition made after the making of the adoption order by the adopting parent, shall, unless a contrary intention appears, include an adopted child or children or the issue of an adopted child.\u201d Further, subs. (6) of s. 6 stated:\nSave as herein provided and as to persons other than the adopting parent, the adopted child shall not be deemed the child of the adopting parent.\nThis was the statutory position in R.S.O. 1927, c. 189, s. 5; R.S.O. 1937, c. 218, s. 6; R.S.O. 1950, c. 7, s. 12, until it was changed in 1954 by the enactment of The Child Welfare Act of that year (1954 (Ont.), c. 8, Part IV). During this period, it is clear that these appellants could not take under this will because the will was prior to the adoption order. There may also be other disqualifications which it is unnecessary to consider.\nOne significant change introduced by the legislation of 1954 was the omission of the express limitation of rights of adopted children to those acquired under subsequent instruments. (Section 77(6) and (12) of the 1954 legislation stated:\n(6) An adoption order confers upon the adopted child or any issue of the adopted child the same rights to and interests in property under any intestacy of or disposition by the adopting parent or any kindred of the adopting parent as if the adopted child was a child born to the adopting parent in lawful wedlock.\n(12) Except as provided in this Part, an adopted child shall not be deemed the child of the adopting parent. The 1954 legislation was repealed in 1958 by The Child Welfare Amendment Act, 1958, c. 11, ss. 74 and 75, both of which are set out above. Again there is no limitation on the rights of adopted children to those acquired under subsequent instruments. The adopted child is now a child for all purposes except the law of incest and consanguinity in relation to marriage. He becomes a full member of the family of his adopting parent including the kindred of the adopting parent, and s. 75 says that this applies to every person heretofore adopted under the laws of Ontario.\nWhen s. 75 of the 1958 legislation speaks of a \u201cperson heretofore adopted being governed by this Part\u201d I take it to mean that on January 1, 1959, when the new legislation came into force, he then acquired the status of a child as defined in s. 74. In any case involving the status of an adopted child arising after this date, this Act and this Act alone is to be applied and this is an Act which has omitted a previous limitation on the rights of adopted children but which does not say in so many words that in the construction of all wills, whenever made, the word \u201cchild\u201d now includes an adopted child. The question is whether the new legislation has done the same thing when it makes an adopted child a child for all purposes. The judgment of the Court of Appeal holds that it has not for the following reasons:\n(a) The word \u201cchild\u201d in a will in the absence of some strong context to the contrary means a lawful child of the body of the person named.\n(b) There is no context in the will of Sir William Gage to the contrary. Unless the subsequent adopting legislation in force at the date of the death of Mrs. McCormack has the effect of altering the meaning of the will, Mrs. McCormack did die leaving no child her surviving. The Court of Appeal, therefore, is dealing with the problem not as one of after-acquired status but as one of alteration of a will by statutory compulsion after the will has been made and has come into effect.\n(c) To the Court of Appeal, it must be shown that the will is now to be read as if it had said \u201cleaving no child or adopted child her surviving\u201d.\n(d) To the Court of Appeal, two basic principles prevent any such statutory alteration of the will. The first is that where a statute is passed altering the law, unless the language is expressly to the contrary, it has to be taken as intended to apply to a state of facts coming into existence after the Act. The second basic principle is that a statute should not be construed so as to interfere with existing property rights unless there are clear words showing such an intention.\nIt appears to me, with respect, that this treatment of the problem imposes a limitation on the application of ss. 74 and 75 which no longer exists. It involves a re-affirmation of the limitation of the rights of adopted children under wills which existed under the legislation from 1927 to 1954 but which no longer exists. My conclusion is that after January 1, 1959, these three appellants were the children of Mrs. McCormack and not adopted children with limited rights; that as children they answer the description in the will, and that Mrs. McCormack died leaving children who take that part of the residue from which she was drawing income.\nI do not think that this conclusion is in any way weakened by Re Donald, Baldwin v. Mooney[7] and Re Marshall[8]. Both cases are concerned with a domestic will and the extent of the recognition to be given to an adoption in a foreign domicile. In the Donald case the testator left a share of the residue of his estate to a named individual with a substitutional gift to the children of that beneficiary should he predecease the testator. The beneficiary, who did predecease the testator, died domiciled in the State of Washington where he had adopted a child, who, according to the law of that State, was to all intents and purposes the child and legal heir of the adopting parent as though he were a child of that person born in lawful wedlock. This legislation is indistinguishable from that contained in s. 74 of the Ontario legislation of 1958. This Court held, on appeal per saltum from the Court of King\u2019s Bench of Saskatchewan, that the child did not take under the Saskatchewan will and that the question was not one of status but whether the adopted child was a person such as was mentioned and described in the bequest. At the date of the death of the testator, as is pointed out in the Reporter\u2019s Note at p. 306, there was no adoption legislation in force in Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan Court and this Court refused to recognize a status acquired by adoption which was unknown to the law of the province. This was a view that had some acceptance at that time (vide Dicey, Conflict of Laws, 3rd ed., 1922, p. 501). There is room for doubt whether this was ever a tenable view but even if it were, it has no application to the present case, where adoption is fully recognized by Ontario domestic law. In the circumstances, I would accept the suggestion made by Falconbridge in Conflict of Laws, 1st ed., p. 587, that the Donald case might be treated as a special case dependent on the then condition of provincial legislation and not as being a decision which should preclude reconsideration of the Court\u2019s attitude towards recognition of adoption under a foreign law.\nRe Marshall, supra, was decided at a time when adoption had received some recognition in England but not to the extent of the Ontario legislation of 1958. The testator made his will in April of 1945 and died in June of that year domiciled in England. He left a life interest to his wife and on her death directed the division of the residuary estate among certain named cousins, with a substitutional gift as follows:\nProvided always that should any of the above cousins be then dead leaving issue then living such issue shall take the share his her or their parent would have taken had such parent survived me and my said wife.\nOne of the named cousins had acquired a domicile in British Columbia. In March of 1945, which was before the date of the will, he had adopted a child in British Columbia. This cousin died in 1950. The testator\u2019s wife died in 1955. The question again was whether the adopted child could take under this substitutional gift.\nBoth Harmon J.[9] and the Court of Appeal held that he could not. The Court of Appeal, after a detailed examination of the adoption legislation of British Columbia, namely, the Act of 1920, as amended in 1936, held that the rights and privileges conferred by this legislation fell far short of those which characterized the status of a child and that the Court could not find that an English testator in a bequest to \u201cchildren\u201d could have had in contemplation adopted children with rights so limited. The Court also considered the amending legislation of 1953 and doubted, contrary to the opinion of Harmon J., whether it would have been sufficient, even if it had applied. But in considering the 1956 legislation, which is the same as s. 74 of the Ontario legislation of 1958, the Court did say that it appeared to be sufficient to place an adopted child in the position of that of a natural child for all purposes. All this is obiter but the plain inference is that the decision would have been different if the 1956 legislation had applied.\nWe are not concerned here with one of the difficulties that troubled the Court of Appeal. The 1958 legislation is adequate to make an adopted child into a child. There is no such person in Ontario after 1958 as an adopted child. He is a child for all purposes. In order to take, must he be a child according to the law as it stood at the date of the testator\u2019s death? In considering the extent of the recognition to be given to a foreign adoption, both Harmon J. and the Court of Appeal held that the testator\u2019s death was the relevant date. The Court of Appeal said at p. 525:\nAccordingly, we think that so far as adopted children are concerned, their status and capacity to take under a gift to \u201cchildren\u201d in an English will is (subject, of course, to British legislation) fixed once and for all at the testator\u2019s death and that subsequent legislation in the country of their domicile enlarging their rights is to be disregarded.\nHarmon J. had stated the rule without the qualification introduced by the Court of Appeal \u201csubject, of course, to British legislation\u201d. It was this omission that led Whittaker J. in his judgment in Re Stuart, Toronto General Trusts Corp. & Stuart v. Stuart[10], to question the application of the rule to a purely domestic situation where the will and the adoption were governed entirely by the law of British Columbia.\nThe only rule enunciated in Re Marshall, and it has no application to the present case, was a rule of English conflict of laws that succession to the movables in England of a person dying domiciled abroad is governed by the law of the domicile as that law stood at the date of the death of the individual in question and was unaffected by changes in the law of the domicile subsequent to the death. This principle was applied in determining the extent of the recognition to be given to a foreign adoption but it leaves untouched the effect to be given to domestic legislation subsequent to the testator\u2019s death on a domestic adoption also subsequent to the testator\u2019s death. Re Marshall, therefore, contains no rule that the relevant date for ascertaining the class of persons capable of taking under this will is the date of the testator\u2019s death, which was January 14, 1921. The class of children is to be ascertained on the death of the life tenant Gladys McCorniack. On that date these appellants, by Ontario legislation, had the status of children and the Court must recognize that status.\nOn the death of the testator, a gift to the children of A meant prima facie a gift to the legitimate children of A and not to illegitimate or adopted children. I can well understand the finding of the Court of Appeal that this is what the testator intended. But the class of children cannot be ascertained until the death of Mrs. McCormack and, in the meantime, legislation has intervened to change the meaning of the word \u201cchildren\u201d and to make these appellants into \u201cchildren\u201d. The meaning of the word in this will cannot be considered apart from the statute and the statute has made them answer the description contained in the will in the same way that children born of the body of Mrs. McCormack in lawful wedlock would answer the description.\nThe legislation must be applied to a state of facts as it exists at the time when the class of children is to be ascertained in order to determined who are children. Where this is the problem, and in the absence of any proviso limiting the application of the legislation, I can see no basis for any rejection of its application to wills made before its enactment, whether or not adoption was known to the law at the time of the execution of the will.\nI have examined the New Zealand and Australian cases referred to in the judgment in Re Blackwell. The New Zealand legislation has always provided that it does not apply to enable rights to be acquired under a prior will unless it is expressly so stated in the prior will. The legislation considered in Pedley\u2011Smith v. Pedley-Smith[11], was to the same effect. The significance of these cases is that the enquiry is confined to the question whether the adopted child is claiming under a prior instrument, that is whether the case is within the proviso. If it is not, it seems fundamental to all the decisions that the legislation is of general application,, For example, in the Pedley-Smith case a will made in 1934 settled property on a beneficiary for life with a special power of appointment in favour of issue of that beneficiary. In 1940 she adopted two children and in 1949, exercised the special power in their favour. The New South Wales legislation made an adopted child a child for all purposes except with respect to prior wills. The judgment in Pedley-Smith, following Muir v. Muir[12], was that the child would take, if at all, under the prior will and not under the subsequent exercise of the special power. Had it not been for the proviso in the legislation, there would have been nothing to prevent the adopted child, under legislation of this kind, from taking.\nI am therefore of the opinion that the sound approach to this problem is that stated in Re Clark[13] (Dysart J.); Re Stuart[14] (Whittaker J.) and Re Blackwell[15] (McRuer C.J.H.C.). For the reasons given, I would follow these decisions. The appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal set aside and the judgment of Spence J. restored.\nAs to costs, I would restore the order of Spence J. made on the motion. The respondents in this appeal, other than the trustee, must pay the appellants their costs both in this Court and the Court of Appeal. The trustee\u2019s costs were provided for by Spence J. on the motion. In this Court and in the Court of Appeal I would make the same order, namely, that the trustee is entitled to its costs, on a solicitor and client basis, payable out of the estate.\nAppeal dismissed, JUDSON and RITCHIE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Hume, Martin & Allen, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondents, Irene G.

The farming operations carried on by the appellant between 1944 and 1953 were minimal. However, in each year during that period, with the exception of 1949, she sold topsoil from a 37-aere portion of her farm to the mushroom company. In 1953, she sold the 37-acre parcel to a highway contractor for $120,000. The contract of sale required the purchaser to remove the topsoil and spread it on the remaining portion of the appellant's farm. The appellant then sold all that topsoil to the mushroom company for $18,500.\nThe Minister ruled that the amounts she received for the topsoil were income subject to tax. This decision was reversed by the Income Tax Appeal Board but was, in turn, restored by the Exchequer Court. It was argued for the Minister that the amount was taxable as income from a business or, in the alternative, taxable under s. 6(1)(j) as payments dependent upon use of or production from property. The appellant contended that the topsoil profit was a capital gain from the partial realization of an investment. She also argued that if these amounts were taxable she was entitled under s. 27(1)(e) of the Act to deduct the losses sustained by her in operating the farm in the five years preceding and in the year following 1953.\nHeld (Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed, but only to the extent necessary to permit a minor adjustment which the Minister admitted should be made.\nPer Taschereau, Abbott, Judson and Ritchie J.: The sales of topsoil had no relation to any farming operations since the disposal of the topsoil, if carried to its ultimate conclusion, would have rendered any farming operation impossible. In disposing of the topsoil the appellant was engaged in a scheme of profit making or an adventure or concern in the nature of a trade and the profits therefrom were taxable income within the meaning of ss. 3, 4 and 139(1)(e) of the Act. The appellant had no right to deduct losses incurred in the five years immediately preceding and the year immediately following 1953 since these losses were not incurred from the business of selling topsoil. Under s. 27(1)(e) of the Act, the right to deduct from income losses sustained in other years does not extend to income from an activity other than the business in which the loss was sustained. There was no essential distinction between the sales made in 1953 and those made in earlier years.\nPer Cartwright J., dissenting: The payments for the topsoil paid over the years, with the exception of the payment of $18,500 in 1953, were payments for the granting to the company of a licence, analagous to a profit \u00e0 prendre, and constituted taxable income as being amounts received from the use of property but not as profits from a business. The evidence did not establish the right to make any deductions from these sums.\nThe $120,000 plus the topsoil delivered by the purchaser represented the total consideration on the sale of a portion of the farm and such entire sum, including the $18,500 into which the topsoil was promptly converted, was a capital receipt in the hands of the appellant and as such was not subject to tax.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Fournier J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, reversing a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board. Appeal dismissed with a variation, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nJ. J. Robinette, Q.C., and D. Andison, for the appellant. D. S. Maxwell and G. W. Ainslie, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Abbott, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014The facts\u2014as to which there is little or no dispute\u2014are fully stated in the reasons of the learned trial judge and in those to be delivered by my brother Cart-wright which I have had the advantage of considering.\nThe farming operations carried on by appellant on her property during the period 1944 to 1953 appear to have been minimal, to say the least. The only revenues shown as having been derived from such operations during that period are two amounts of $200 from the sale of hay in each of the years 1945 and 1946. However, in each year during the said period\u2014with the exception of 1949\u2014appellant disposed of topsoil taken from the portion of her property lying to the north of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company right of way, and which portion was sold by her to Miller Paving Limited in 1953 for $120,000.\nIt is clear I think, that these sales of topsoil had no relation to any farming operations which appellant may have been conducting on her property, since such disposal of the topsoil, if carried to its ultimate conclusion, would have rendered any farming operation impossible.\nThe learned trial judge held on the facts that in disposing of topsoil, appellant was engaged in a scheme of profit-making or an adventure or concern in the nature of a trade, and that the profits derived therefrom were income within the meaning of ss. 3, 4 and 139(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act and subject to tax. In my opinion, he was right in so holding . I am in substantial agreement with his reasons and conclusions on this point and there is little I can usefully add to them.\nThe learned trial judge did not deal with the alternative argument of appellant that if the amounts in question were held to be income, she was entitled to deduct her losses in operating the farm property in the five taxation years immediately preceding 1953 and in the taxation year 1955. He may have felt that it was not necessary for him to do so.\nAs I have stated, in my view appellant's dealings in top-soil had no relation to any farming operations she may have been carrying on. Under the provisions of s. 27(1) (e) of the Income Tax Act the right to deduct from income in any taxation year business losses sustained in the five taxation years immediately preceding and the taxation year immediately following that taxation year does not extend to income from an activity other than the business in which the loss was sustained. The Minister of National Revenue v. Eastern Textiles Ltd.2; Utah Company of the Americas v. The Minister of National Revenue3. The losses, if any, incurred by appellant in the five years immediately preceding and the year immediately following the taxation year 1953 were losses which were not incurred from the business of selling topsoil, and accordingly are not deductible from the profits arising from that activity.\nIn my opinion what the appellant did during a period extending from 1945 up to and including 1953 was to sell topsoil for an agreed price to Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Ltd., a company of which her late husband was the principal shareholder and of which she herself was an officer and shareholder. It is true that the purchaser undertook to defray all the costs of stripping and processing the topsoil and of taking delivery, but I am unable to see what bearing that had upon the essential character of the transaction. Had appellant undertaken to perform these services, the price would no doubt have been higher and for tax purposes the cost of performing such services would have been deductible from the price as an expense. So far as the appellant's profit was concerned, the result would have been the same. Under s. 12(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act the only expenses which may be deducted in computing income are those made or incurred by the taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income from property or a business of such taxpayer. In virtue of the arrangement made with the purchaser, appellant incurred no expense in connection with the sales of topsoil made by her.\nI am unable to discern any essential distinction between the sales of topsoil made by appellant in 1953 and those made in earlier years. It is clear from appellant's own evidence, that prior to her selling the 37 acres to Miller Paving Limited, Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Ltd. had offered to buy and she had agreed to sell the remaining topsoil on that portion of her property for a total sum of $18,500. In order to carry that agreement into effect, appellant when selling the 37 acre tract to Miller Paving Limited made the sale subject to a covenant whereby the purchaser undertook to remove the topsoil from the land purchased and spread it over the land retained by appellant. That covenant was implemented and in due course Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Ltd. took delivery of the topsoil and paid the price agreed upon.\nIn his factum and at the hearing before us counsel for respondent conceded that the amount received by appellant in the year 1953 from the sale of topsoil was $19,235 and not $20,000 as set out in the re-assessment of appellant's income for that year.\nThe appeal in respect of the assessment for the 1953 taxation year should be allowed in part and the re-assessment referred back for further re-assessment so as to include in appellant's income for that year the sum of $19,235 instead of $20,000, but otherwise the re-assessment should be affirmed. The appeal in respect of the re-assessment for the 1954 taxation period should be dismissed.\nThe respondent is entitled to his costs in this Court.\nCartwright J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court4 whereby an appeal by the Minister from a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board was allowed.\nThe questions raised are whether the sums of $19,235 and $1,500 received by the appellant in the taxation years 1953 and 1954 as a result of transactions having to do with top-soil were part of her income and if so whether in the computation of her taxable income she was entitled to make certain deductions.\nThe appellant is the widow of Anthony Orlando who died in 1958 and who from 1944 until the date of his death was the president and principal shareholder of Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Ltd. The appellant was a partner in a wholesale fruit business known as Scorsone Fruit Company and was also a shareholder and the secretary of Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Ltd. She looked after the office records of that company. The plant for growing mushrooms owned and operated by Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Ltd. was located in a part of the metropolitan area of the city of Toronto which was developing rapidly into a residential, commercial and shopping centre district, and the appellant was of the opinion that the company might at some future time be obliged to move its plant. In June of 1944 the appellant purchased a farm property in the Township of Scarborough which was situate about four and one-half miles northeast from the plant of Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Ltd. This property consisted of ninety-seven acres and the price was $18,000. The appellant bought this property as an investment having in view the possibility of reselling it to Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Ltd. or allowing that company to use it in the event that it either needed additional land for the expansion of its plant or was forced to move its plant from its present location.\nThe farm purchased by the appellant was divided into two parcels by a right of way of the Canadian Pacific Railway running from east to west. The northerly parcel contained about 37 acres and the southerly parcel about 60 acres.\nShortly after she had purchased the farm, the appellant received a request from her husband, on behalf of Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Limited that he be permitted to test some of the topsoil from the farm in the growing of mushrooms. The appellant consented and the soil proved to be suitable. As a result Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Limited proceeded to take topsoil from the appellant's farm each year from 1945 to 1952 inclusive, but excluding 1949. There appears to have been no written agreement between the appellant and Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Ltd. as to the taking of topsoil but the arrangements under which it was taken in those years were as follows. Appellant designated the area on the farm from which the topsoil could be taken; agents of Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Limited then came on the property with their own equipment, conditioned the topsoil to their own satisfaction and then loaded and transported it off the property in their own vehicles. The appellant was paid at the rate of $2 per cubic yard for the topsoil so taken. At no time did the appellant supervise or cause to be supervised the removal of the topsoil and she relied upon the calculations of Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Limited as to the amounts taken. As a result of these arrangements the appellant received from Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Limited the following amounts in the years 1945 to 1952.\nYear Amount Received\n1945 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. $1,142.00\n1946 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 1,620.00\n1947 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 1,240.00\n1948 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 1,575.00\n1949 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. nil\n1950 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 2,600.00\n1951 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 1,350.00\n1952 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 1,080.00\nAll of the topsoil taken in these years and in respect of which the said amounts were received by the appellant, was taken from the thirty-seven acre parcel of the appellant's property situated to the north of the Canadian Pacific Railway right-of-way.\nIn 1953 the appellant received a letter from the Department of Highways of the Province of Ontario advising her that the northerly thirty-seven acre parcel of her farm was required for departmental use. The letter contained an offer of $1,500 per acre for the land and threatened expropriation proceedings if the offer was not accepted. The appellant was then approached by Miller Paving Limited, a company which held a contract for the construction of a portion of Highway 401 in the vicinity of the appellant's farm and received an offer from that company for the purchase of the northerly thirty-seven acre parcel of her farm. Miller Paving Limited advised the appellant that they wanted the land for fill. The appellant was also approached by Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Limited and received an offer from that company to purchase from her all of the topsoil from the same thirty-seven acre parcel.\nThe appellant accepted the offer of Miller Paving Limited but caused the following terms to be included in the agreement:\nPROVIDED that the purchaser before making use of the said lands for its purposes or otherwise shall remove at its own expense the topsoil from the said lands to a maximum depth of six inches (6\"); the said topsoil to be removed across the Canadian Pacific Railway right of way and spread on the northerly limit of other lands of the vendors in close proximity to the said railway right of way, the other lands of the vendors hereinbefore referred to being part of Lot 31 in Concession 2 of the Township of Scarborough.\n* * * And it is further mutually agreed by and between the parties hereto that if the purchaser shall not have removed the topsoil from the said lands or from any of the said lands in accordance with the terms of this agreement by the date of closing of this transaction, the purchaser shall remove the topsoil at his own expense to a maximum depth of six inches (6\") and stock-pile the same as provided in this agreement within a reasonable time after the date of closing, and will deliver to the vendor on or before closing his covenant under seal so to remove and spread the topsoil.\nAt the time the sale to Miller Paving Limited was closed, the topsoil had not been removed from the thirty-seven acres and an agreement was executed between the parties extending the time for its removal.\nThe appellant also accepted the offer of Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Limited, thereby agreeing to sell them the topsoil from the thirty-seven acres.\nThe price in money which Miller Paving Limited agreed to pay for the thirty-seven acres of land was $120,000, i.e., approximately $3,300 per acre. The price which Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Limited agreed to pay for the thirty-seven acres of topsoil was at the rate of $500 per acre, i.e., $18,500.\nThe sale of the topsoil from the thirty-seven acres was closed in 1953 and the $18,500 consideration was received by the appellant in December of that year.\nIn 1954 the appellant received $1,500 from Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Limited. This was paid to her as consideration for topsoil taken from her farm in 1953 but prior to the time of the sale of the topsoil from the thirty-seven acres.\nThe appellant made no sales of topsoil after the year 1953. She has never sold topsoil to anyone other than Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Limited nor has she ever offered top-soil for sale generally. She did no advertising. She was approached from time to time by gardeners and landscapers who sought to buy topsoil from her but in all cases she refused. She had no equipment for the removal of topsoil. She has never at any time been engaged in the business of buying and selling or trading in real estate.\nAt the trial, a chartered accountant called as a witness for the appellant, produced a statement which was filed as ex. 3 showing that even on the basis of treating all the amounts received for topsoil as an income receipt from the operation of the appellant's farm that operation had resulted in a loss in every year from 1944 to 1954, inclusive, except the years 1946 and 1953, in which there was, on the basis stated, a profit of $163.22 in 1946 and of $17,800.09 in 1953.\nIn making her returns of income for the years 1944 to 1954 inclusive and in computing her income for each of those years the appellant did not include any receipts derived from the farm property either in relation to topsoil or otherwise and did not deduct any expenses incurred in relation thereto.\nBy notices of reassessment mailed on January 23, 1957, the respondent gave notice to the appellant that he had re-assessed her for the taxation years 1953 and 1954 to add to her income for those years amounts of $20,000 and $1,500 respectively in respect of the sale of topsoil to Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Limited. Counsel for the respondent informed us that on the basis of his argument being accepted in its entirety the figure of $20,000 should be changed to read $19,235.\nThe respondent has not at any time sought to include in the appellant's income any amount in respect of the gain realized by her on the receipt of the sale price of $120,000 paid for the 37 acres by Miller Paving Limited. The learned trial judge expressed the opinion that this was properly treated as a capital gain. This was in accordance with the position taken by counsel for the Minister at the trial who said in part:\nIt is not the original purchase we are concerned about. We are not disputing that it was bought for an investment purpose. What we are saying is after she bought the farm she came into the business of selling topsoil.\nAt the trial it was contended on behalf of the Minister:\n(a) that the amounts received by the appellant were income from a business within the meaning of sections 3, 4 and 139(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act; or\n(b) in the alternative, that the amounts received were dependent upon use of or production from property and were therefore income within the meaning of section 6(j) of the Act.\nIt was contended on behalf of the appellant:\n(a) that she had not carried on business or engaged in an adventure or concern in the nature of trade in respect of any topsoil and that the amounts in question were received by her on the realization of a portion of her capital and were therefore capital gains; or\n(b) in the alternative that, if the amounts in question were income from a business within the meaning of the Income Tax Act, the appellant\u2014 (i) in computing her income from that business for the taxation years under appeal was entitled to deduct the expenses of operating the farm property in those years; and\n(ii) in computing her taxable income from that business for those years, was entitled to deduct, pursuant to the provisions of section 27(1)(e) of the Act, the losses sustained by her in operating the farm property in the five taxation years immediately preceding 1953 and in the taxation year 1955.\nIt was further contended on behalf of the appellant that the amounts received were not income within the meaning of s. 6(j) of the Act because the amounts received were payments for a specified portion of the lands sold and were not dependent upon the use of or production from property.\nThe learned trial judge in his reasons stressed the fact that the appellant had been disposing of topsoil for money for a number of years and went on to hold that the sale for $18,500 in 1953 was a transaction of the same sort as those of earlier years. He said in conclusion:\nIn the final analysis, the respondent, when dealing with the Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Limited in 1953, was not disposing of her land but was dealing with a commodity which had been deposited on her property and which was delivered, carted away and paid for by the buyers. As this transaction was preceded by many other sales during a long period of time and at a price and in a manner which could produce a profit, it cannot be said that the profit realized from the sale was a casual profit made on an isolated sale. The respondent incurred no expense nor made any outlay in these trading operations. The 1953 sale was one of many which from the moment when merged with all the others, in my view, clearly indicates that the respondent had embarked on a scheme for profit making, the profits of which are subject to taxation.\nMy conclusion is that the sums of $18,500 and $1,500 received by the respondent in the taxation years 1953 and 1954 were profits derived from an adventure or concern in the nature of a trade and not capital gains. They were income within the meaning of ss. 3, 4 and 139(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act and subject to taxation.\nThe learned trial judge did not deal with the alternative argument of the appellant that if the amounts in question were held to be income she was entitled to deduct her losses in operating the farm property in the five taxation years immediately preceding 1953 and in the taxation year 1955.\nBefore this Court counsel for the appellant argued that the learned trial judge was in error in finding that the appellant was engaged at any time in the business of selling topsoil; he contended that all payments received for topsoil other than the $18,500 were the consideration paid to the appellant for the granting to Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Limited of a profit a prendre enforceable in equity (or a right analogous thereto) and that these sums were income liable to tax (subject to his argument as to the right to deduct expenses and losses) not as profits from a business but as income from property.\nIn my opinion the payments of $2 per cubic yard of topsoil paid over the years by the Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Limited to the appellant were payments for the granting to the company of a licence, analogous to a profit a prendre, permitting it to enter the lands of the appellant and take therefrom for its use a portion of the soil subject to payment therefor at the price agreed; from this it follows that the amounts so paid constituted taxable income of the appellant as being amounts received by her from the use of her property but not as profits from a business.\nDifferent considerations apply to the payment of the $18,500. In 1953, faced with the probability of expropriation the appellant decided to sell the northerly parcel of her farm consisting of 37 acres. The consideration offered by Miller Paving Limited for this parcel was not merely $120,000; it was that sum plus its covenant to remove the topsoil from the 37 acres to a maximum depth of 6 inches and to deposit the soil so removed on the southerly parcel retained by the appellant. The agreement of the appellant to sell this topsoil to Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Limited appears to have been made contemporaneously with her agreement to sell the northerly parcel to Miller Paving Limited and in the result the consideration which she was to receive from Miller Paving Limited was substantially the equivalent of $138,500, that is about $3,740 per acre. The uncontradicted evidence of the appellant was that at the time of the sale the prevailing price for farm land in the vicinity of her farm was $4,000 per acre.\nIn my opinion the $120,000 plus the topsoil delivered by Miller Paving Limited represented the total consideration received by the appellant on the sale of a portion of her farm; all of this in her hands was a capital receipt; this applies no less to the $18,500 into which the topsoil was promptly converted than to the $120,000. The situation is, in principle, the same as if the appellant had received for the 37 acres, $120,000 plus some bonds or other securities which she had at once sold for $18,500. I conclude that the $18,500 was a capital receipt and is not subject to tax. If the view which I have just expressed fell to be rejected, it would be necessary to consider what other views might be taken of the transaction. It is, I think, obvious that the $18,500 could not be regarded as a payment for a licence analogous to a profit a prendre. The topsoil from the 37 acres placed on the appellant's property south of the railway did not thereby become part of her land. It was a commodity stockpiled there awaiting its removal by the purchaser Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Limited.\nA possible alternative view would be that the appellant acquired this topsoil as part of her stock-in-trade in the business of selling topsoil. But if this, contrary to my opinion, be the right view it seems clear that before she could be said to have made any profit on disposing of the topsoil some figure representing the cost of the soil would have to be entered in the accounts of the business. The judgment of the House of Lords in Sharkey v. Wernher5 appears to me to make it clear that the figure to be entered would not, in the circumstances of the case at bar, be less than the market value of the topsoil delivered to the appellant.\nWhat then was the market value of the topsoil delivered to the appellant in pursuance of the covenant of Miller Paving Limited? The evidence does not disclose the precise quantity delivered. If it be assumed that an average depth of only 3 inches, instead of the maximum of 6 inches provided in the covenant, was delivered, a simple arithmetical calculation shows the quantity to have been approximately 15,000 cubic yards. The uncontradicted evidence was that the current market price of topsoil at the time was not less than $2 per cubic yard. Consequently the figure to be entered in the accounts as the cost of the topsoil would be more than the $18,500 for which the appellant sold it and the accounts would shew no profit.\nFor the above reasons I am of opinion that the respondent erred in adding the sum of $18,500 to the appellant's income for the taxation year 1953.\nIt remains to consider the sum of $735 (the difference between the said sum of $18,500 and the sum of $19,235, the total amount received in payment for topsoil in 1953) and the sum of $1,500 received in payment for topsoil in 1954. In my opinion these two sums represent payments of the same sort as those made for topsoil prior to the year 1953, that is to say they were received by the appellant for a licence analogous to a profit a prendre granted to Maple Leaf Mushroom Farm Limited and are properly regarded as taxable income received by her from the use of her property. I do not think that the evidence established the right to make any deductions from these sums.\nI would allow the appeal in part and direct that the assessment of the appellant for the taxation year 1953 be referred back to the respondent to be amended in accordance with these reasons, that is to say, by adding to the appellant's income for that year the sum of $735 instead of the sum of $20,000.\nThe appeal having succeeded to the extent of $18,500, although not as to the items of $735 and $1,500, I would direct that the appellant be entitled to her costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with variation, Cartwright J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McCarthy & McCarthy, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

In 1948 the testator and his wife, the petitioner respondent, separated and later entered into a separation agreement under which the former conveyed the matrimonial home to the latter and paid her an allowance of $375 a month. It was provided that should the property be sold or subdivided the monthly payments would be reduced to $350. In his will the testator, who died in 1956, directed that his executors should pay to the respondent until her death or remarriage the monthly sum required by the separation agreement, but this was the only provision made for her. The bulk of the estate, which had a net aggregate value of approximately $1,300,000, was bequeathed to a daughter.\nOn application by the widow under s. 3 of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 336, the trial judge increased the maintenance allowance to $700 a month. The widow appealed and by the judgment of the Court of Appeal the judgment at trial was amended to provide that the petitioner should receive $25,000 in cash and $1,000 a month free of income tax. The daughter then appealed to this Court, and the widow cross-appealed, asking that the award be varied by granting to her a one-third interest in the net estate, or, in the alternative, an increase in the amount of the monthly allowance provided by the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed.\nThe language of s. 3 of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act authorizes the Court in its discretion on the application of a wife to direct that such provision as is deemed adequate, just and equitable in the circumstances shall be made out of the estate of the testator. In deciding what is adequate, just and equitable in the circumstances, the Court should properly consider the magnitude of the estate and the situation of others having claims upon the testator. Walker v. McDermott, [1931] S.C.R. 94, applied. The respondent should receive sufficient to maintain her in the manner in which a wife would normally be maintained by a husband financially situated as was the present testator. No sound reason was shown to justify this Court in interfering with the award made by the majority of the Court of Appeal.\nThe cross-appeal was also dismissed; the amount awarded was adequate, just and equitable in the circumstances disclosed by the evidence.

(2d) 585, distinguished.\nAPPEAL and cross-appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Ruttan J. allowing a petition under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed.\nJ. G. Gould and T. Reagh, for the appellant.\nJ. J. Robinette, Q.C., and A. B. Ferris, for the petitioner, respondent. F. H. Bonnell, Q.C., for the executors.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014This is an appeal by Beverley Louise McCarvill, the residuary legatee named in the will of Harold Alfred Jones, deceased, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal[2] allowing an appeal by the present respondent, Catherine Louise Jones, from an order made by Ruttan J. under the provisions of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 336. The respondent is the appellant's mother and has cross-appealed, asking that the award made by the judgment appealed from be increased.\nThe respondent is the widow of Harold Alfred Jones who died at Vancouver on December 24, 1956. The parties were married on April 15, 1922, and the appellant, born October 10, 1929, is the only child of the marriage. Throughout their married life together they lived at 1775 Trimble Street in Vancouver. In 1948 they separated and the respondent brought an action for a judicial separation at Vancouver, in consequence of which they entered into a separation agreement dated April 7, 1949. By the terms of this agreement, Jones agreed to pay to his wife during their joint lives $350 a month and to convey to her the property on Trimble Street, a desirable residential street in Vancouver, the property being between three and four acres in extent. The agreement provided that until such time as the wife should sell or subdivide the property the monthly allowance should be $375 and contained the usual provisions that the wife should support and maintain herself and indemnify the husband against any debts which she might incur. The property upon which an eleven-room house was situate was transferred to the respondent and she has continued to live there up to the present time. No steps have been taken by her to subdivide or to sell the property.\nFollowing the transfer of this property to the respondent she executed a mortgage upon it, at her husband's request, to secure a sum of $3,500 of which Jones received $1,500 on terms that he would repay it and this was subsequently done. At that time, according to the respondent, Jones claimed that he was hard up financially but, as the evidence indicates, his circumstances improved greatly between the dates of the separation and of his death. The will in question was dated December 9, 1955, and was amended by a codicil dated December 19, 1956. The value of the estate for succession duty purposes was shown as $1,971,531.87 and the total debts $654,406.05, leaving a net aggregate value for succession duty purposes of $1,317,125.82. The executors named were described as Mildred Clements Fox Jones and McCarvill, the son-in-law of the testator. The former was referred to in the will of the testator as his wife. However, this was inaccurate since his marriage to the respondent, referred to in the will as his former wife, had not been dissolved.\nThe will provided that the trustees appointed should pay to the respondent until her death or remarriage the monthly sum required by the separation agreement. That agreement had stipulated that the payments were to be made only during the joint lives of the parties and the provision for the maintenance of the payments was the only provision made by the testator for the respondent.\nSection 3(1) of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act reads as follows:\n3. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or Statute to the contrary, if any person (hereinafter called the \"testator\") dies leaving a will and without making therein, in the opinion of the Judge before whom the application is made, adequate provision for the proper maintenance and support of the testator's wife, husband, or children, the Court may, in its discretion, on the application by or on behalf of the wife, or of the husband, or of a child or children, order that such provision as the Court thinks adequate, just, and equitable in the circumstances shall be made out of the estate of the testator for the wife, husband, or children.\nThe petition was filed on December 12, 1957, and was heard by Ruttan J., the present appellant opposing the making of any order. Evidence was given at length by the parties and, by an order entered on April 20, 1960, that learned judge directed that the executors should pay to the petitioner during her lifetime the sum of $700 a month, this amount to include the $375 payable under the will, the order to be effective from December 24, 1956, being the date of the death of the testator.\nThe respondent appealed from that order and by the judgment of the Court of Appeal the judgment at the trial was amended by providing that the executors pay to the petitioner the lump sum of $25,000 in cash from the corpus of the estate and during her lifetime the sum of $1,000 a month, the amount to include the $375 payable under the terms of the will and to be paid income tax free from the date of the death of the testator. Davey J., dissenting in part, agreed that the award of $25,000 should be made but considered that the monthly allowance made by Ruttan J. was sufficient in the circumstances.\nThe principal assets of the testator were shares in the Vancouver Tug Boat Co. Ltd., Vancouver Tug and Barge Ltd., Vancouver Towing Co. Ltd., Vancouver Lighterage and Salvage Co. Ltd., Vancouver Scow Co. Ltd., and several other companies engaged in the tug boat and towing business on the West coast. Shortly prior to his death, he had purchased sixty per cent of the shares of the Dolmage Towing Co. Ltd. and its subsidiaries for $600,000, his liability for this purchase constituting the greater part of the debts owing at the time of his death.\nThe will authorized the executors to carry on the business of the first five of the companies above named for a period not to exceed twenty-one years and to accumulate the net income or to pay it to his daughter, the present appellant. At the end of such period of operation it was directed that the shares of Vancouver Scow Co. Ltd. should be given to certain named persons and at such time the rest of the shares were to be transferred to his daughter. The annuity directed to be paid to the respondent was to be paid out of the residue of the estate or out of dividends received by the executors on the shares hereinbefore mentioned and, subject to this, the entire residue, after payment of the debts and certain small specific legacies, was bequeathed to the daughter. This legacy, after payment of succession duties, was valued at $727,359. In addition to this, the appellant as the beneficiary of his life insurance policies and from gifts made in advance of the testator's death received approximately $125,000. He had also given to Mrs. Fox assets valued in excess of $42,000.\nThe evidence of the witnesses Vallance and Pearson, the latter of whom was the controller of the companies at the time of the trial, described the steps taken by the executors to provide for the payment of succession duties and of the debts. It is sufficient to say that, following the death of the testator, the executors deemed it advisable to reorganize the set-up of the various companies, to acquire the remaining forty per cent of the shares of the Dolmage Towing Company and its subsidiaries, and to continue the operations. The company now controlling the various other companies in which the testator was interested is the Vancouver Tug and Barge Co. Ltd. and the consolidated balance sheet of that company and its wholly owned subsidiaries showed a profit in excess of $77,000 in 1957, and in excess of $157,000 in 1958.\nThe executors did not give evidence at the trial and the purpose of adducing evidence as to the financial position of the companies was apparently to indicate the difficulties faced by them in administering the estate and, presumably, those that might be met in paying any substantially increased allowance to the respondent.\nThe respondent was born in the year 1898 and since the date of the separation from her husband has endeavoured to supplement her income by renting portions of the house from time to time and by permitting its use for wedding receptions. The taxes upon the property approximate $1,200 a year and, at the time of the trial, there were arrears to the City of Vancouver and accumulated penalties amounting to $3,309. In addition, she was indebted to a bank for moneys borrowed in the amount of $3,000, owed trade accounts of $600 and there remained payable upon the mortgage given by her at the instance of her husband in 1940 the sum of $2,200. She was also indebted to her daughter, the present appellant, in the sum of $1,000 which she had borrowed in 1957 following her husband's death. The respondent had applied to the executors to lend her this amount but they had refused and her daughter then lent it to her on condition that if she proceeded with a claim against the estate the money must be repaid. Giving evidence at the trial the respondent said that she was in very poor health and her medical adviser, Dr. Grimson who had attended her for many years, gave evidence as to this and considered that she had a life expectancy of a little less than ten years.\nUpon the appeal much was made of the fact that the respondent had not taken any steps to subdivide the property which she received at the time of the separation agreement. As above stated the separation agreement provided that until this property should be sold or subdivided the monthly payments should be $375 but upon such sale or subdivision they should be reduced to $350. The respondent wished to continue to live in the house which had been her home since the early days of her marriage and, apparently, had made no serious effort either to sell the property or to have it subdivided. Evidence at the trial indicated, however, that there were serious difficulties in obtaining approval to a plan of subdivision which would permit the sale of the northerly part of the property for building lots. Davey J.A. considered that the property sold en bloc as a home was worth about $40,000. The wishes of the respondent in the matter are not, in the circumstances of this case, to be ignored.\nThe language of s. 3 of the Act authorizes the Court in its discretion on the application of a wife to direct that such provision as is deemed adequate, just and equitable in the circumstances shall be made out of the estate of the testator. Section 3 of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act, R.S.B.C. 1924, c. 256, the terms of which were identical with s. 3(1) above quoted, was considered by this Court in Walker v. McDermott[3]. Duff J. (as he then was) in delivering the judgment of the majority of the Court, said in part (p.96):\nWhat constitutes \"proper maintenance and support\" is a question to be determined with reference to a variety of circumstances. It cannot be limited to the bare necessities of existence. For the purpose of arriving at a conclusion, the court on whom devolves the responsibility of giving effect to the statute, would naturally proceed from the point of view of the judicious father of a family seeking to discharge both his marital and his parental duty; and would of course (looking at the matter from that point of view), consider the situation of a child, wife or husband, and the standard of living to which, having regard to this and the other circumstances, reference ought to be had. If the court comes to the decision that adequate provision has not been made, then the court must consider what provision would be not only adequate, but just and equitable also; and in exercising its judgment upon this, the pecuniary magnitude of the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator, must be taken into account.\nIt is clear, in my opinion, that in this case the will did not make adequate provision for the proper maintenance and support of the testator's wife, within the meaning of that language in the Act. The difference in opinion between the learned judges who have considered the matter is as to the quantum of the added allowance that should be made.\nSo far as the evidence discloses, the only persons for whom the testator was under any moral obligation to provide were his wife and daughter. There is no dower law in British Columbia and, accordingly, the only relief available to the respondent was under the Act referred to. The Act is not intended to vest in the court the power to make a new will for the testator (Bosch v. Perpetual Trustee Co., Ltd.[4]).\nIt is apparently the fact that the executors had up to the date of the trial exercised their right under the will to operate the companies referred to, and while the exact extent of the estate's shareholdings in the Vancouver Tug and Barge Co. Ltd. is not stated, I construe the evidence as showing that it owns the great majority of the shares in that company and its subsidiaries and that, in addition to the amounts received by the appellant from the life insurance and from gifts from her father, there will be a large annual income available from the company's operations as soon as the balance of the succession duties has been paid.\nIn deciding what is adequate, just and equitable in the circumstances, the court should properly consider the magnitude of the estate and the situation of others having claims upon the testator, as pointed out in McDermott's case. The respondent should, in my opinion, receive sufficient to maintain her in the manner in which a wife would normally be maintained by a husband financially situated as was the present testator in the Trimble street property.\nIn my opinion, no sound reason has been shown to justify this Court in interfering with the award made by the majority of the Court of Appeal and I would accordingly dismiss this appeal.\nThe respondent has cross-appealed, asking that the award be varied by granting to her a one-third interest in the net estate or, in the alternative, an increase in the amount of the monthly allowance provided by the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nSection 5 of the Act declares that the court may if it thinks fit order that the provision made shall consist of a lump sum, and we have been referred to three cases decided in the courts of British Columbia where the award made was a definite share of the estate. In Re Dupaul[5] and in Barker v. Westminster Trust Co.[6], the applications under the Act were made by the husbands of the testators. The value of the estate in the former case was some $9,400 and in the latter approximately $18,000 and in each case the husband claimed to have contributed substantially to the building up of the estate. The respective awards were something less than a third of the estate in Re Dupaul and the larger part of it in Barker's case. In a more recent case, Re Callegari[7], the applicant was the wife and the net value of the estate was something less than $7,300. The other claimants were nephews of the deceased and the award was one-half of the estate.\nThe disposition made of applications under the Act where the estates involved such small amounts are of no assistance in deciding the question to be determined in the present matter. In each of them there were special circumstances to be considered which are absent in the present matter and, except possibly in the case of the Barker estate, there was no income from which the provision referred to in s. 3 could have been made.\nIn my view, the amount that has been awarded is adequate, just and equitable in the circumstances disclosed by the evidence and I would dismiss the cross-appeal.\nThe respondent contended in argument that if the principal appeal was dismissed she should be awarded her costs as between solicitor and client in this Court. While a similar request was made to the trial judge and in the Court of Appeal it was not acceded to in either court.\nThe dismissal of the appeal and of the cross-appeal should, in my opinion, be with costs upon a party and party basis. The costs of the executors in this court should be paid as between solicitor and client out of the residue of the estate.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the respondent, appellant: Gould, Thorpe & Easton, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the petitioner, respondent: Davis, Hossie, Campbell, Brazier & McLorg, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the executors, respondents: Campney, Owen & Murphy, Vancouver.\n[1] (1961-62), 36 W.W.R. 337. 30 D.L.R.

After obtaining oral and documentary evidence, as authorized by the Act, the director prepared a statement of evidence of the nature referred to in s. 18(1). Included in this statement were a series of allegations based upon the evidence considered alleging various breaches of the Act by the appellants and by certain other individuals and organizations. Different portions of the allegations referred to different parties. One of the parties who had been investigated, and who, as required by the Act, had been supplied with a copy of the director's statement of evidence, applied to the Restrictive Trade Practices Commission for a full disclosure of all the evidence and documents that had been examined by the director. In response to this request the Commission gave a direction to make all the material available.\nThe appellant companies brought actions in the Supreme Court of British Columbia in each of which an injunction was asked restraining the defendants (the chairman and members of the Commission) from making this material available to any person except to members of or employees of the Commission or to the Minister of Justice or any person acting in an official capacity under his direction. In addition, the appellant companies asked a declaration that publication of the material to any member of the public or to any of the persons named in the allegations was unlawful. The British Columbia Courts held that the Commission had power to direct that the material be supplied. In a similarly constituted case in Ontario the trial judge came to the opposite conclusion; there was an appeal pending from that decision to the Court of Appeal. Appeals from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia were brought to this Court.\nHeld (Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeals should be allowed in part.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Locke, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: While the chairman of the Commission had informed the appellants of his intention to make available the transcript of the evidence and all of the documents to the party who had requested this material, after an injunction was granted in the Ontario proceedings he informed them that he proposed to hold a hearing to hear argument as to whether this should be done. The matter was thus reopened and in the circumstances the appellants were not entitled to an injunction.\nThe appellants were, however, entitled to a declaration that upon the true construction of s. 18 of the Act the director, and in this case, the Commission are required to furnish to each person against whom an allegation is made in the statement of evidence a copy of the evidence taken at the instance of the director, only in so far as such evidence relates to the allegations made against such person, and copies of only such of the documents taken from the possession of the appellant companies as are relevant to the allegations made against him.\nPer Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: The duty imposed on the Commission by s. 19(1) of the Act to make a report to the Minister in which it must review the evidence, appraise the effect on the public interest of arrangements disclosed in the evidence, and contain recommendations as to the application of remedies provided in the Act or other remedies is not limited to a review of the statement of evidence alone. It contemplates a consideration of the evidence and material on which the statement of evidence is based, together with such further or other evidence or material as the Commission has deemed it advisable to consider pursuant to s. 18(3).\nThe Commission, interposed as an impartial tribunal between the director and those against whom he makes allegations, and charged with the duty of giving full opportunity to be heard, has by necessary implication the power to furnish to one against whom an allegation is made the relevant evidence and documents on which the allegation is based, but it has no further power of disclosure. The decision as to what further information, if any, in addition to that contained in the statement of evidence was necessary in this case was committed to the Commission subject to the limitations set out in the declaration directed to be made.\nPer Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ., dissenting in part: There was no express statutory power authorizing disclosure of all the evidence and documents. Nothing in the Act gave the Commission any express power over documents except in the event of a further inquiry under s. 22. Neither could the power of disclosure be found by implication in the duty to afford the applicant a full opportunity to be heard under s. 18. Whether full opportunity to be heard involves a right to this sort of production had been decided, adversely to the applicant, in Advance Glass & Mirror Co. Ltd. v. Attorney-General of Canada & McGregor, [1949] O.W.N. 451, and Re The Imperial Tobacco Co. and McGregor, [1939] O.R. 627. Nor could the power to order disclosure of documents be read into s. 18(3).\nThis was not a preliminary inquiry in a criminal prosecution nor anything in the nature of a preliminary inquiry. It was merely a hearing for the purpose of determining what kind of report was to be made to a Minister of the Crown. A full opportunity to be heard in these circumstances did not require and did not justify all this elaboration of procedure and discovery. There was no statutory authorization for it and there was risk of frustration of the whole purpose of the Act, which is directed solely to investigation and research. The right to be heard should be applied in this context.\nAPPEALS from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], dismissing appeals from the judgment of Sullivan J. Appeals allowed in part.\nJ. J. Robinette, Q.C., and J. G. Alley, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nD. S. Maxwell, Q.C., and G. W. Ainslie, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Locke, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014These are appeals from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] brought pursuant to leave granted by this Court. The judgment appealed from dismissed appeals of the present appellants from the judgment of Sullivan J. at the trial.\nThe respondents, the defendants in the action, are the members of the Restrictive Trade Practices Commission appointed under the provisions of s. 16 of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 314. The facts necessary to be considered are, in my opinion, as follows:\nIn consequence of an application made to the Director of Investigation and Research, Mr. T. D. McDonald, appointed under the provisions of s. 5 of the said Act, the director conducted inquiries into the operations of the appellant companies, the United Fishermen and Allied Workers' Union and certain other associations and organizations, to be hereinafter referred to in relation to the production, purchase and sale of raw fish on the West Coast of British Columbia.\nDuring the months of July and August 1956, representatives of the director, after obtaining a certificate of the nature referred to in subs. (3) of s. 10 of the Act, took from the premises of the appellant corporations, of the union and certain of such associations certain letters, copies of letters, reports, memoranda and other documents, as authorized by subs. (1) of s. 10. During the months of October and November 1957 some officers and employees of the appellant companies, including all of the individual appellants, were examined on oath before a member of the Board in private by the director or his authorized representatives pursuant to subs. (1) of s. 17.\nThereafter the director prepared a statement of the evidence of the nature referred to in s. 18(1) of the Act. This statement contains a summary of the oral evidence taken and of the contents of some of the documents seized and concluded with a series of allegations based upon the evidence considered, alleging various breaches of the Combines Investigation Act by the parties appellant, certain individuals and certain organizations, some of which are not parties to these proceedings.\nThis statement of evidence forms part of the Case in these matters and is some 565 pages in length. As required by s. 18(1) copies of this document were submitted to the Commission. On the assumption that this section required that it be done, copies of the entire statement were supplied to each of the persons against whom an allegation was made. The statement contains copious extracts from the evidence taken on the hearings which, in each case, were held in private and includes a large number of references to some of the documents seized as aforesaid. With these exceptions, none of the evidence which, as the record indicates, is some 3,000 pages in extent, and none of the documents were disclosed to any of the parties concerned.\nThe statement of the evidence and the allegations signed by the director bears the date May 27, 1959. Following the delivery of this document to the parties, Mr. Homer Stevens, the secretary-treasurer of the United Fishermen and Allied Workers' Union (hereinafter referred to as the Union) wrote to the respondent Smith on June 11, 1959; saying, inter alia:\nYour \"Statement of Evidence\" is only a partial summary of evidence submitted by other organizations and individuals connected with the fishing industry. We naturally want to know everything that was said or submitted, in order to prepare our defense against what appears to be a onesided and extremely illogical set of allegations. Will you therefore send us a copy of the full transcript of evidence submitted by the persons listed in Appendix A, pages 583 to 592 inclusive, excepting of course the transcript of evidence by the writer which we already have received? Will you also send us copies of all the documents listed in Appendix B and Appendix C, pages 593 to 595 inclusive, except those obtained from Union files which we have in our possession.\nThe pages of the transcript referred to included the evidence of a considerable number of witnesses who were officials or employees of the appellant companies and the documents referred to included a large number taken from the files of the Fisheries Association of B.C., of which the appellant companies were members, and seven of the packing companies who are parties appellant.\nOn September 14, 1959, the union wrote to the chairman repeating the request of Stevens for the material referred to in the letter of June 11 above mentioned. To this the respondent Smith replied on September 21, 1959, saying that copies of the transcript of the evidence of the witnesses and of all the documents listed in Appendices B and C of the statement of evidence, other than those taken from the union files, were being prepared and would be forwarded shortly. On the same date the chairman wrote the appellant Canadian Fishing Co. Ltd. informing that company of the proposed action, and similar notices were given to the other appellant companies. The appellant Canadian Fishing Co. Ltd., by letter dated October 2, 1959, informed the chairman that it objected to the delivery of the transcript or any of the documents, and similar objections were made on behalf of the other companies. Mr. Smith considered these objections and rejected them, setting out the Commission's reasons in a letter addressed to the solicitors for the appellant B.C. Packers Ltd. dated October 9, 1959, and wrote similar letters to the other appellant companies or their solicitors.\nThe appellant companies thereupon commenced an action in the Supreme Court of Ontario against the respondent Smith, the director, and the Attorney General of Canada, for an order restraining the delivery of the evidence or of the documents, and obtained an interim injunction from the local judge of that Court in Ottawa on October 22, 1959. The injunction was continued by an order of Aylen J. until the trial. That action came on for trial before the late Mr. Justice Danis on March 26, 1960, and judgment was reserved. At the trial the restraining order made by Aylen J. was amended so that it restrained the delivery of the transcript and of the documents:\nexcept to the extent that the said Restrictive Trade Practices Commission after the commencement of its public hearing to be heard pursuant to s. 18(2) of the said Act with respect to the said statement of evidence orders or directs the disclosure of the said material in whole or in part.\nDanis J. died before delivering judgment and the case was then heard and decided by Parker J. whose judgment[3] granting the plaintiffs the relief asked was delivered on May 30, 1961, after the institution of the present proceedings. The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal and that appeal is now pending in that Court.\nNo further steps had been taken by the respondents in British Columbia following the institution of the action in Ontario but on May 24, 1960, after the terms of the interim injunction granted in those proceedings had been altered in the manner above stated, the respondent Smith wrote to the appellant companies, referring to the Ontario proceedings and saying in part:\nIn order to comply with the terms of the injunction the Commission has fixed 10 a.m. on the morning of Monday, the 25th day of July, 1960, in the City of Vancouver, British Columbia, as the time and place at which the hearing before the Commission will be held. It is anticipated that the only matter that will be dealt with at that time is the request of certain parties to the proceedings for a copy of the transcript and of the documents upon which the Director has relied in the preparation of the Statement of Evidence, and that the hearing will then be adjourned to a subsequent date.\nThe Commission proposes that the subsequent date for resuming the hearing will be Monday, November 7th 1960. Argument may be presented on this point at the hearing in July.\nThis appears to have been a clear intimation that the decision of the Commission referred to in the letter of October 9, 1959, was to be reconsidered.\nAt the request of counsel for the appellant corporations, the date of the preliminary hearing referred to was changed to September 29, 1960.\nOn September 28, 1960, the writs were issued in the present actions and interim orders of injunction restraining the respondents from delivering the transcript or the documents until the trial of the actions obtained by the various plaintiffs.\nNo order for consolidation had been made but, by consent, the five actions were tried together. The case of the appellant Canadian Fishing Co. Ltd. was first presented, the evidence consisting of the matters disclosed in an agreed statement of facts, various documents and portions of the examination for discovery of the respondents Whiteley and Smith. No oral evidence was given. Certain of the other plaintiffs tendered further evidence relating to their own cases and all adopted that given on behalf of the Canadian Fishing Co. Ltd. Notwithstanding the fact that paragraph 8 of the statement of claim of that company alleged that the director or his representatives:\nentered into the premises of the Plaintiff company and took away, inspected and copied statements, documents and letters, many of a confidential nature, disclosing the plaintiff company's methods of business and operation, some of which were written by the individual plaintiffs acting as officers of the Plaintiff company.\nand notwithstanding that the allegation that the documents taken were of a confidential nature disclosing the plaintiff company's method of business and operation had been put in issue by paragraph 2 of the statement of defence, no evidence was given on the issue so raised and the only information as to the nature of the documents in this record is such as is given in the statement of evidence prepared by the director. The expression \"combine\" is defined in s. 2 of the Combines Investigation Act. Section 32 declares that any person who is a party or privy to or knowingly assists in the formation or operation of a combine is guilty of an indictable offence.\nWhen an application is made to the director in the manner required by s. 7 as amended, the director is required to conduct an inquiry whenever he has reason to believe that s. 32 or 34 of the Act or s. 411 or 412 of the Criminal Code has been or is about to be violated, or whenever directed so to do by the Minister of Justice. Section 18 of the Act as amended reads:\n18. (1) At any stage of an inquiry,\n(a) the Director may, if he is of the opinion that the evidence obtained discloses a situation contrary to section 32 or 34 of this Act, or section 411 or 412 of the Criminal Code, and\n(b) the Director shall, if so required by the Minister, prepare a statement of the evidence obtained in the inquiry, which shall be submitted to the Commission and to each person against whom an allegation is made therein.\n(2) Upon receipt of the statement referred to in subsection (1), the Commission shall fix a place, time and date at which argument in support of such statement may be submitted by or on behalf of the Director, and at which such persons against whom an allegation has been made in such statement shall be allowed full opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel.\n(3) The Commission shall, in accordance with this Act, consider the statement submitted by the Director under subsection (1) together with such further or other evidence or material as the Commission considers advisable.\n(4) No report shall be made by the Commission under section 19 or 22 against any person unless such person has been allowed full opportunity to be heard as provided in subsection (2).\nSection 19(1) reads:\nThe Commission shall as soon as possible after the conclusion of proceedings taken under section 18, make a report in writing and without delay transmit it to the Minister; such report shall review the evidence and material, appraise the effect on the public interest of arrangements and practices disclosed in the evidence and contain recommendations as to the application of remedies provided in this Act or other remedies.\nThis section further provides that, following the transmission of this report to the Minister, the director shall deliver all documents taken by him to those from whom they were taken, unless required to retain them by the Attorney General of Canada. The inquiry conducted by the director was directed to the activities of the appellants, the Fisheries Association of B.C., the following organizations: United Fishermen and Allied Workers' Union, Native Brotherhood of British Columbia, Fishing Vessel Owners' Association of British Columbia, B.C. Fishermen's Independent Co-Operative Association, Prince Rupert Fishermen's Co-Operative Association, Prince Rupert Fishing Vessel Owners' Association; the Deep Sea Fishermen's Union, and of Stevens and other persons who were officers of certain of these organizations. The inquiry was directed to these activities in connection with the production, purchase and sale of raw fish in the four principal fisheries of British Columbia, namely, the salmon, herring, halibut and trawl fisheries.\nOf these various organizations other than the appellant companies and the Fisheries Association of B.C. those most actively engaged in the operations which were considered were the two Co-Operative associations and the Native Brotherhood. Of the individuals named, the secretary-treasurer of the union appears to have taken the leading part.\nWith minor exceptions, the fishermen are not employees either of the packing companies by whom the larger part of the catch is purchased, or of the Fisheries Association which represented them in some of the negotiations. The arrangements under which the fishermen are generally remunerated in the salmon industry is by the division of the proceeds of the catch between the vessel owners, the crew and the fishermen. While the union represented the majority of the shore workers of the members of the Fisheries Association and, presumably, as their bargaining agent negotiated wage agreements on their behalf since the relationship of employer and employee did not exist between the fishermen and the companies, they being joint venturers with the vessel owners, the status of the union as regards the fishermen was not that of a trade union to which the Labour Relations Act, 1954 (B.C.), c. 17, or the Trade-unions Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 342, applied. It was apparently as a voluntary association representing the fishermen that written agreements were signed by this union which determined the prices to be paid for the various types of salmon and regulated in various respects the manner in which the vessels were to be operated. The director's report on this branch of the industry covers the period from 1945 to 1958.\nThe facts elicited in this branch of the inquiry are summarized by the director at p. 575 of the statement of evidence, the director alleging that during the period 1947 to 1958 the appellants: the Anglo-British Columbia Packing Company, British Columbia Packers Ltd., the Canadian Fishing Co. Ltd. and Nelson Brothers Fisheries Ltd. were parties or privies to or knowingly assisted in arrangements designed to have the effect of fixing prices and otherwise preventing or lessening competition in the production, purchase, sale or supply of raw salmon in British Columbia unduly or to the detriment or against the interests of the public. It was further alleged that during the said period Alexander L. Gordon, William Rigby, Homer J. Stevens, shown to have been officers of the union, the Native Brotherhood of British Columbia and the Fishing Vessel Owners' Association, respectively, were parties to arrangements of the same nature. In addition, it was alleged that during the period 1949 to 1958 Gordon, Rigby, Stevens and the Native Brotherhood were parties or privies to such arrangements.\nThe director asserted in this portion of his statement that the fish packing or canning companies in effect operated as one unit through the Fisheries Association in fixing prices or minimum prices to be paid for fish.\nIn the herring fishery the director found that the fishermen were joint venturers in the fishing and not employees and that the stoppages of work in this and in the other fisheries referred to as strikes were not labour disputes within the meaning of the provincial legislation. The agreement between the union representing the fishermen and the Fisheries Association representing the companies fixed prices and provided for the limitation of the number of vessels fishing and the director asserted that the result of the agreement was to prevent or lessen competition unduly, within the meaning of the statute. Between the years 1953 to 1957, both inclusive, he alleged that the Anglo-British Columbia Packing Co. Ltd., British Columbia Packers Ltd., the Canadian Fishing Co. Ltd., Nelson Brothers Ltd., Gordon, Rigby and Stevens were parties or privies to these arrangements. He further asserted that in the years 1952 and 1953 and 1957 and 1958 Rigby and Stevens were parties or privies or knowingly assisted in arrangements having this effect in the herring industry.\nIn the halibut fishery the director said that the large majority of the longline vessels are owned by the companies who are members of the Fisheries Association and individuals who are members of the Fishing Vessel Owners' Association and the members of the Prince Rupert Fishing Vessel Owners' Association. There are no price agreements, minimum or otherwise. There are agreements as to the distribution of the proceeds of the catch between the union representing the fishermen and the Fishing Vessel Owners' Association and the Prince Rupert Fishing Vessel Owners' Association and the Deep Sea Fishermen's Union. The object of the agreements between the unions and the vessel owners is alleged to be to prevent non-union or non-association members from engaging in the longline halibut fishery, and thus restricting the facilities for producing, supplying or dealing in raw halibut. It is further asserted that rules designed to curtail the catch of halibut in the years 1956 and 1957 were adopted by the union, the Native Brotherhood and the Fishing Vessel Owners' Association and others. This portion of the report deals also with certain of the operations of the Vancouver Fishing Exchange where part of the catch of halibut is sold. Of the appellant companies, the Canadian Fishing Co. Ltd. and Edmunds and Walker Ltd. are members, the latter a subsidiary of the B.C. Packers, and it is said that the exchange was so operated as to substantially prevent and lessen competition.\nIn this fishery the director alleged that the Fishing Vessel Owners' Association and Wm. H. Brett, the secretary-treasurer of the Deep Sea Fishermen's Union, Stevens and Matthew H. Waters, the secretary of the Fishing Vessel Owners' Association, were between the years 1951 and 1957 parties to arrangement designed to have the effect of limiting facilities for producing, supplying and dealing in raw halibut unduly or to the detriment or against the interests of the public. Similar allegations are made against the Fishing Vessel Owners' Association and Gordon, Rigby and Stevens during the years 1956 and 1957 and against the Canadian Fishing Company and Edmunds and Walker Ltd. during the period 1955 to 1957, regarding the operations of the Vancouver and New Westminster halibut exchange.\nIn the trawl fishery the majority of the vessels are owned by individuals, only a very few being owned by the companies. About one-third of the vessels are owned by members of the Fishing Vessel Owners' Association and a somewhat smaller proportion by the members of the B.C. Co-Operative. There is no employer-employee relationship between the companies, the vessel owners and the fishermen, and the only formal agreement is that made by the union with the Fishing Vessel Owners' Association referred to in connection with the halibut fishery. There are no minimum or specific price agreements. In 1947 and 1952 the fishermen refused to work during periods of varying length, these stoppages being described as strikes, and it is the steps taken on behalf of the union at these times which were the basis for the allegations made by the director.\nAs to this the director alleged that Rigby and Stevens were in the year 1947 parties or privies or knowingly assisted in arrangements having or designed to have the effect of preventing, limiting or lessening production of trawl or bottom fish unduly or to the detriment or against the interests of the public. Similar allegations are made against Gordon, T. Parkin and Stevens as to the stoppage in 1952.\nNo allegations were made against the appellants J. H. Todd and Sons, Queen Charlotte Fisheries Ltd. and Anderson and Miskin Ltd. and it is admitted that the director removed from the premises of these companies certain of their documents of the nature referred to in paragraph 9 of the statement of claim of the first mentioned of these companies, though their confidential nature was denied.\nSullivan J. considered that the statement of the evidence referred to in s. 18 included the documents referred to in it. That learned judge said in part:\nThe difficulty of this case arises out of the unusual circumstance that the basis of the Director's allegations against sundry competing firms and the employees of some of them is contained in his one Statement of Evidence, some portions of which affect one of them and other portions of which refer only to others. Considering that the Commission had a discretionary power to decide as to the material to be given to the various parties, he dismissed the action.\nThe appeals in the five actions were consolidated in the Court of Appeal. Desbrisay C.J.B.C. considered they should be dismissed and gave no written reasons. O'Halloran J.A. agreed that the statement of evidence referred to included all the evidence taken and documents referred to in it. He considered that while the duty to supply this material was imposed upon the director by s. 18 of the Combines Investigation Act it rested also on the Commission by necessary implication and that the Commission should direct that this be done.\nSheppard J.A. agreed that the Commission was vested with the power to supply the documents and held that it was for that body to determine what documents are fairly required in the case of such person against whom an allegation is made in the exercise of its powers under s. 18(3).\nThe disposition to be made of this matter depends, in my opinion, upon the interpretation which should be placed upon the language of subs. (1) (b) of s. 18, in so far as it relates to a person against whom an allegation is made by the director. The statement of evidence to be submitted to the Commission must, of necessity, be the evidence and the documents relating to all of the allegations made. But where, as in this case, there are allegations of conduct contrary to the statute against four of the companies, in respect of arrangements said to have been made inter se in relation to the salmon fishery with which Stevens and the other union officials are not concerned, and allegations of such conduct against Rigby, Stevens, Gordon and Parkin in relation to the trawl fishery with which none of the appellants are concerned, is it intended that nonetheless all the evidence taken on all the inquiries made and the relevant documents are to be supplied to persons other than those against whom the allegations are made?\nThe cardinal rule for the construction of Acts of Parliament is that they should be construed according to the intention of the Parliament which passed them. Section 15 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 158, which applies to this Act declares that every Act shall be deemed remedial and shall accordingly receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act, according to its true intent, meaning and spirit.\nSubsection (1) (b) is to be read together with subss. (2) and (4) of s. 18 which makes the purpose of the requirement perfectly clear, that being to enable such person to advance before the Commission, at the hearing to be held, such arguments as he may be advised against the allegations made against him.\nAs pointed out by Mr. Justice Sullivan, the difficulty has arisen by reason of the fact that the director prepared but one statement of evidence obtained by him in the course of several inquiries. Had a separate statement been prepared in respect of the alleged activities of the companies inter se and of those of the Trade union officials against whom the allegations are made in respect of the trawl fishery, no such question could have arisen. In my opinion, the construction to be placed upon the subsection should not be affected by the fact that the summary of the evidence taken during all of the inquiries was included in the one document.\nWhere the usual meaning of the language falls short of the whole object of the legislature, a more extended meaning may be attributed to the words if they are fairly susceptible of it (Maxwell, 10th ed. p. 68). It was this principle that was applied in the House of Lords in construing the Workmen's Compensation Act in Lysons v. Andrew Knowles & Sons Limited[4]. As it was said by Lindley L.J. in The Duke of Buccleuch[5], you are not to attribute to general language used by the legislature a meaning that would not only not carry out its object but produce consequences which, to the ordinary intelligence, are absurd. It was said in the Court of Appeal in Holmes v. Bradfield Rural District Council[6]:\nthe mere fact that the results of applying a statute may be unjust or even absurd does not entitle this court to refuse to put it into operation. It is, however, common practice that if there are two reasonable interpretations, so far as the grammar is concerned, of the words in an Act, the courts adopt that which is just, reasonable and sensible rather than one which is, or appears to them to be, none of those things. It would, in my opinion, be manifestly unjust in this matter to require that the evidence and the documents relating to the allegations against the four companies in respect of the agreements inter se should be delivered to parties entirely unconcerned with the allegations made against them or, on the other hand, to supply to the appellant companies the evidence and the union or associations' documents seized which may be relevant to the allegations made against the four individuals.\nIn my view, it is not to be assumed that Parliament required this unless the language employed will not bear any other interpretation. In the present case it appears to me clear that what was intended was that the person referred to in subs. (1) (b) should receive only copies of the evidence taken and the documents referred to in the statement, so far as they are relevant to the allegations made by the director against such person.\nThe prayer for relief in the various actions asks an injunction restraining the defendants from furnishing or making available to any person a transcript of the evidence given by the officers or employees of the various appellant companies in the course of the inquiry, or any of the documents seized at the instance of the director, the property of the plaintiff company, except to members of or employees of the Commission or to the Minister of Justice or any person acting in an official capacity under his direction. In addition, the appellant companies ask a declaration that the furnishing or making available at any time by the defendants or any of them of all or any part of the said transcript or the said documents to any member of the public or to any of the persons named in the allegations made in the statement of evidence is unlawful. A claim of this nature is permitted by Marginal Rule 285 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of British Columbia.\nAs I have pointed out, while the chairman of the Commission had informed the appellants of his intention to make the transcript of the evidence and all of the documents available to Stevens in response to his request, after the judgment in the Ontario action he informed them that he proposed to hold a hearing to hear argument upon the question as to whether this should be done. The matter was thus reopened and in the circumstances the appellants are not, in my opinion, entitled to an injunction. The appellants are, however, in my opinion, entitled to a declaration that upon the true construction of s. 18 of the Combines Investigation Act the director, and in this case, the Commission are required to furnish to each person against whom an allegation is made in the statement of evidence a copy of the evidence taken at the instance of the director, only in so far as such evidence relates to the allegations made against such person, and copies of only such of the documents taken from the possession of the appellant companies as are relevant to the allegations made against him. To this extent, I would allow the appeals.\nIn view of the fact that success is divided on these appeals there should, in my opinion, be no order as to costs in this Court or in the Courts below and the judgments at the trial and in the Court of Appeal should be amended accordingly.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J. (dissenting in part):\u2014The Combines Investigation Act as it now stands contemplates a division of responsibility between the Director of Investigation and Research, whose office is constituted by s. 5, and the Restrictive Trade Practices Commission, which is set up by s. 16(1). It is the director's duty to conduct an inquiry by examination of witnesses and investigation of documents, and he is given broad powers of compulsion and seizure. The purpose of his inquiry is to prepare a statement of evidence for submission to the Commission, and upon receipt of this statement the Commission conducts a hearing at which any person against whom an allegation has been made in the director's report must be allowed \"full opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel\".\nAfter conducting this hearing the Commission must make a report in writing to the Minister. The report must review the evidence, appraise the effect on the public interest of the arrangements disclosed in the evidence, and contain recommendations as to the application of remedies provided in the Act or other remedies.\nIt is at once apparent that the functions which were once combined in one person, who was called the Commissioner under prior legislation, are now divided between the director and the Commission. They were vested in the Commissioner when Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. Attorney General for Canada[7]; O'Connor v. Waldron[8],; and Re The Imperial Tobacco Co. Ltd. et al. and McGregor[9] were decided, but there has been no change in the sum total of the function, and its characterization in these cases is still applicable. The combination of exercise of powers under this Act even today results in no more than a recommendation by the Commission to the Minister. The analysis made in O'Connor v. Waldron, at p. 82, is still accurate when applied to the present Act. Speaking of the commissioner under the old Act, the judgment says:\nHis conclusion is expressed in a report; it determines no rights, nor the guilt or innocence of any one. It does not even initiate any proceedings, which have to be left to the ordinary criminal procedure.\nThis action is brought by certain companies and individuals whose activities have been investigated by the director, who has delivered to the Commission a statement of evidence containing 640 pages. One of the parties who has been investigated, The Allied Fishermen & Workers' Union, has applied to the Commission for a full disclosure of all the evidence and documents that have been examined by the director. There are, I understand, more than 9,000 documents as well as the transcripts of the oral hearings. The applicant union has been supplied with a copy of the director's statement of evidence. The Act requires this. But the applicant goes further and says that it must have all the material. The Commission has given a direction to make all this material available. The British Columbia Courts have held that the Commission has power to direct that this material be supplied. In a similarly constituted action in Ontario[10], Parker J. has come to the opposite conclusion.\nThe question is whether the Commission has power to furnish anyone with this material. These plaintiffs object to the transcripts of the examinations of their officers and their documents being placed in the hands of the applicant and they seek an injunction to restrain such disclosure. All the inquiries made by the director, as required by s. 28 of the Act, have been conducted in private. The hearing under s. 18, pursuant to a ruling already given by the Commission, is to be held in public. There is, in my opinion, no express statutory power authorizing this disclosure. Part I of the Act deals with the director's powers of investigation and research and I will deal with these only to the extent that they deal with the gathering of information. Section 9 requires any person to give information under oath or affirmation, as called for by a notice in writing from the director. Section 10 authorizes him to enter any premises for the purpose of obtaining evidence. He may examine and take away any documents and make copies. If he takes away documents for copying, provision is made for the return of the originals within a certain time. Section 11(1) provides that \"All books, papers, records or other documents obtained or received by the Director may be inspected by him and also by such persons as he directs.\" What the precise scope of this section is, I do not know. It is enough to say that it does not authorize the disclosure which the Commission proposes to make in this case. Section 12 requires any person, pursuant to notice in writing, to give evidence upon affidavit or written affirmation. This section seems to overlap s. 9 referred to above but this does not affect the question in this litigation.\nIn Part II, s. 16 sets up the Commission. Section 17 provides for oral examination. A member of the Commission may order this on his own motion or on the ex parte application of the director. It also provides for compelling the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents. The director has custody of these documents and must return them within 60 days. Up to this point in the Act, all documents, whether originals or copies, are in the hands of the director.\nThen follows s. 18, which I set out in full:\n18. (1) At any stage of an inquiry,\n(a) the Director may, if he is of the opinion that the evidence obtained discloses a situation contrary to section 32 or 34 of this Act, or section 498 or 498A of the Criminal Code, and\n(b) the Director shall, if so required by the Minister, prepare a statement of the evidence obtained in the inquiry, which shall be submitted to the Commission and to each person against whom an allegation is made therein.\n(2) Upon receipt of the statement referred to in subsection (1), the Commission shall fix a place, time and date at which argument in support of such statement may be submitted by or on behalf of the Director, and at which such persons against whom an allegation has been made in such statement shall be allowed full opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel. (3) The Commission shall, in accordance with this Act, consider the statement submitted by the Director under subsection (1) together with such further or other evidence or material as the Commission considers advisable.\n(4) No report shall be made by the Commission under section 19 or 22 against any person unless such person has been allowed full opportunity to be heard as provided in subsection (2).\nThis section authorizes the director to submit only a statement of evidence. He has done this in the two volumes above referred to and comprising 640 pages. The director may submit argument in support of his statement of evidence and other interested parties must be given a full opportunity to be heard. But it is the director who has possession of the documents and there is nothing in the Act, until proceedings for a further inquiry under s. 22 are taken, which gives the Commission any power over any documents. The hearing under s. 18 is preparatory to the report of the Commission under s. 19. It is this report which is to \"review the evidence and material, appraise the effect on the public interest of the arrangements and practices disclosed in the evidence and contain recommendations as to the application of remedies provided in this Act or other remedies.\"\nIf the Commission, after the hearing provided for in s. 18 is unable effectively to appraise the effect on the public interest, it makes an interim report giving its reasons. It then has power to require the director to make a further inquiry and only at this stage does it obtain any power over documents. By s. 22(2) (c) it may require the director to submit to the Commission copies of any books, papers, records or other documents obtained in such further inquiry. This gives only a very limited power over documents, restricted to those obtained in such further inquiry. Even if proceedings were going on under s. 22\u2014and they are not\u2014there would be no authority for the wide disclosure directed in this case. This case has not yet reached the stage provided for in s. 18, which is the hearing before the Commission. If a report is made under s. 19(1), it is significant that s. 19(2) imposes a duty on the director to return all documents, not already returned unless the Attorney General of Canada certifies that they are to be retained by the director for purposes of prosecution. My conclusion, therefore, is that there is nothing in the Act which gives the Commission any express power over documents except in the event of a further inquiry under s. 22.\nThe next question is whether the power may be found by implication in the duty to afford a full opportunity to be heard under s. 18. I am satisfied that the applicant could not compel the disclosure, on the ground that, without it, it would be deprived of its statutory right. The applicant can come to this hearing with full knowledge of the allegations made against it and with full knowledge of the evidence against it as contained in the depositions (if any) of its own officers and the documents taken from its possession by the director. It is in a position to say that nothing coming from it justifies the director's statement of evidence, or that the statement should be modified in a certain way, or that the allegations made against it are unwarranted. It should be ready to say that the report to be made by the Commission to the Minister should or should not contain any criticism of the union. It should also be prepared to argue what, as far as it is concerned, should be contained in the report. There is no need of all the other material. What other people may have said, either under oral examination or in documents, is at this stage of no concern to the applicant. It is not bound by these statements, if there are any, and at this stage there is no question of the application of s. 41 of the Act. This only applies when there is a prosecution under the Act or the Criminal Code.\nWhether full opportunity to be heard involves a right to this sort of production has been decided, adversely to the applicant, in Advance Glass and Mirror Company Ltd. et al. v. Attorney-General of Canada and McGregor[11] and Re The Imperial Tobacco Company et al. and McGregor[12]. I respectfully agree with these decisions and would apply them here. If there is no right on the part of the applicant, I can find no discretion on the part of the Commission, in the absence of statutory authorization.\nNor do I think that the power can be found in subs. (3) of s. 18, which directs the Commission to consider the statement submitted by the director together with \"such further or other evidence or material as the Commission considers advisable.\" There is plenty of scope for this subsection without reading into it the power to order disclosure of documents. Any interested person has the right to submit anything that is relevant to his case but this does not enable the Commission to get the documents from the director and give them to any party.\nI am therefore of the opinion that the Commission in this case has misconceived its function. This is not a preliminary inquiry in a criminal prosecution nor anything in the nature of a preliminary inquiry. It is merely a hearing for the purpose of determining what kind of report shall be made to a Minister of the Crown. A full opportunity to be heard in these circumstances does not require and does not justify all this elaboration of procedure and discovery. There is no statutory authorization for it and there is a serious risk of frustration of the whole purpose of the Act, which is directed solely to investigation and report. The right to be heard must be applied in this context.\nI would allow these appeals with costs both here and in the courts below and order that the injunctions issue in the terms sought by the appellants.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The relevant facts and the terms of the Combines Investigation Act, hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\", are set out in the reasons of my brother Locke and those of my brother Judson, both of which I have had the advantage of reading. I find myself in substantial agreement with the reasons of my brother Locke and would dispose of the appeals as he proposes; I wish to add only a few observations.\nIn view of the fact that the director has already delivered a copy of the two-volume \"Statement of Evidence\" to each person against whom an allegation is made therein, nothing would be gained by considering whether each of those persons was entitled to receive the whole of the statement or only those portions thereof having relevance to the allegation made against him; but the circumstance that a person has in fact received the whole statement cannot entitle him to receive copies of those portions of the evidence or of the documents therein referred to which are not relevant to the allegation made against him.\nThe powers given by the Act to the Commission and to the director are very wide, including as they do the power to compel persons to testify on oath and the power to take possession of documents which are private property. I think it clear that if it is asserted that the Commission or the director has power to give copies of the transcript of testimony given or copies of documents seized to business competitors or other persons who may have interests adverse to those of the person giving testimony or to whom the seized documents belong, the power asserted must be found in the terms of the Act.\nThe power is not given expressly and the question is whether it arises by necessary implication from the provisions of subs. (2) of s. 18, which require that at the hearing contemplated by the section \"persons against whom an allegation has been made in such statement shall be allowed full opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel\", and from the provisions of subs. (4) of s. 18 which forbid the Commission to make a report under ss. 19 or 22 \"against any person unless such person has been allowed full opportunity to be heard as provided by subs. (2).\"\nThe duty which lies on any body to which the maxim, audi alteram partem, applies has been stated in many cases. In University of Ceylon v. Fernando[13], Lord Jenkins says:\nFrom the many other citations which might be made, their Lordships would select the following succinct statement from the judgment of this Board in DeVerteuil v. Knaggs [1918] A.C. 557 at p. 560:\nTheir Lordships are of the opinion that in making such an inquiry there is, apart from special circumstances, a duty of giving to any person against whom the complaint is made a fair opportunity to make any relevant statement which he may desire to bring forward and a fair opportunity to correct or controvert any relevant statement brought forward to his prejudice.\nI find myself unable to agree with the view of my brother Judson that unless the director chooses to produce them at the hearing provided for by s. 18 the Commission has no power over the documents seized by the director. By subs. (3) of s. 18 the duty laid upon the Commission is to consider not only the statement submitted by the director but also \"such further or other evidence or material as the Commission considers advisable\". In my opinion, the Commission, should it consider it advisable to do so, could require the director to produce at the hearing under s. 18 any or all of the documents in his possession and the complete transcript of the evidence taken before him. By s. 19(1) a statutory duty is imposed on the Commission to make a report to the Minister in which it \"shall review the evidence and material, appraise the effect on the public interest of arrangements and practices disclosed in the evidence and contain recommendations as to the application of remedies provided in this Act or other remedies\". The duty imposed by this subsection is not limited to a review of the \"Statement of Evidence\" alone; it contemplates a consideration of the evidence and material on which the \"Statement of Evidence\" is based, together with such further or other evidence or material as the Commission has deemed it advisable to consider pursuant to s. 18(3).\nAn essential part of the duty to give a full opportunity to be heard is to inform the person against whom an allegation is made of the substance of the relevant evidence, oral or documentary, on which the allegation is based; the imposition of the duty to give this information by necessary implication confers the power to give it. Nowhere in the Act can I find any other implied power to make the disclosure which the plaintiffs seek to prevent.\nIt is true that when the cases of Re The Imperial Tobacco Company et al. and McGregor[14], and Advance Glass and Mirror Company Ltd. et al. v. Attorney-General of Canada and McGregor[15], were decided, the commissioner was under the duty imposed by s. 13 of the Inquiries Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 99, which read:\n13. No report shall be made against any person until reasonable notice shall have been given to him of the charge of misconduct alleged against him and he shall have been allowed full opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel.\nBut, as was pointed out by Mr. Maxwell, there has been a substantial change in the scheme of the applicable legislation since the decisions referred to, in that the present Act has interposed an impartial tribunal between the director and those against whom he makes allegations. I cannot think that the tribunal so interposed and charged with the duty of giving full opportunity to be heard is without the power to furnish to one against whom an allegation is made the relevant evidence and documents on which that allegation is based. I have already indicated my opinion that the Commission has no further power of disclosure.\nWe are not, in the case at bar, called upon to consider how a person against whom an allegation is made should proceed to obtain the information if it were denied to him. The question before us is as to the relief to which the plaintiffs are entitled when they have been advised by the Commission that it proposes to give information the disclosure of which is beyond the implied power referred to above.\nIn my opinion the plaintiffs have claimed the appropriate relief. For the reasons given by my brother Locke I agree with his conclusion that injunctions are not now necessary in view of the fact that the Commission has reopened the question as to what information it will disclose and will no doubt decide that question in accordance with the declaration proposed by my brother Locke and which I agree should be made.\nIt may well be, as my brother Judson suggests, that the information contained in the \"Statement of Evidence\" already delivered will, in the case at bar, prove sufficient to give to each person against whom an allegation is made a fair opportunity \"to correct or controvert any relevant statement brought forward to his prejudice\" and that there will be no necessity of supplying any further information; but, in my respectful opinion, the decision as to what further information, if any, is necessary is committed to the Commission subject to the limitations set out in the declaration which our judgment directs to be made.\nI would dispose of these appeals as proposed by my brother Locke.\nAppeals allowed in part, Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ. dissenting.

Subsequently the appellant company was incorporated and took over the operations of A and in due course entered into a collective agreement with the respondent. By article 23 of the agreement, the appellant agreed to contribute to a retirement benefit plan for employees and agreed to recognize past service of those ex-employees of [A] who have not withdrawn from the plan prior to the date of this agreement\". The union alleged that the company refused to carry out the provisions of article 23 the effect of which, as claimed by the union, was to cover all former employees of A who had not withdrawn from the plan prior to the date of the collective agreement, whether they had been rehired by the appellant company or not. The matter was referred to a board of arbitration the creation of which was provided for by the agreement; two members were appointed by the parties and a third by the Labour Relations Board pursuant to a request of the parties.\nThe company consistently maintained its position that the alleged grievance was not a proper subject for arbitration under the terms of the agreement. The majority of the arbitration board ruled that the board had jurisdiction to proceed with the hearing of the union's grievance. On an application by the company for a writ of certiorari, it was directed that the proceedings be moved into the Supreme Court of British Columbia and that the ruling of the board be quashed. In the Court of Appeal, for the first time, the question was raised whether certiorari would lie against the board; that Court held unanimously that it would not on the ground that certiorari does not lie against an arbitrator or arbitration board unless the arbitrator or board is a statutory arbitrator or statutory board. From that judgment the company appealed to this Court. It was argued that the provision in the agreement that the decision of the board shall be final, read in the light of s. 22(1) of the Labour Relations Act, 1954 (B.C.), c. 17, requiring \"a provision for final and conclusive settlement \u2026 of all differences\", had the effect of prohibiting recourse to the courts by either party to question the jurisdiction of the board or the validity of its award, and thus left prohibition and certiorari as the only available remedies.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe appellant's submission that by the combined effect of ss. 21, 22, 24 and 60 of the Labour Relations Act the arbitration board set up under the terms of the collective agreement was, in substance, a statutory board to which the parties were required to resort was rejected.\nEven if the agreement had not provided that it was made in recognition of and subject to all Dominion and provincial regulations pertaining thereto and to the laws of British Columbia, and that the decision of the arbitration board should be final, insofar as such decision was not inconsistent with any pertinent law, order or directive, words clearer than those used in the agreement and in the statute would be necessary to have the effect of ousting the jurisdiction of the courts. It was open to the parties should occasion arise, to question the jurisdiction of the board or the validity of any award it makes in such manner as is permitted by the Arbitration Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 14 or by the common law. For these reasons and those of the Court below this arbitration board was not one to which certiorari lay and consequently the appeal failed.\nR. v. National Joint Council for the Craft of Dental Technicians, [1953] 1 Q.B. 704, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], setting aside a judgment of McInnes J. given on an application for a writ of certiorari and directing that the proceedings before a board of arbitration be moved into the Supreme Court of British Columbia and quashing a decision of the board.\nJ. J. Robinette, Q.C., and J. G. Alley, for the appellant.\nW. J. Wallace, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRITGHT J.:\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] whereby a judgment of McInnes J. was set aside. The last-mentioned judgment was given on an application for a writ of certiorari and directed that the proceedings before a board of arbitration be moved into the Supreme Court of British Columbia and that a decision or ruling of the board made on November 18, 1960, be quashed.\nIn order to make clear the questions which arise on this appeal it is necessary to set out the facts in some detail.\nOn June 8, 1944, the respondent was certified as bargaining representative of the employees of Britannia Mining and Smelting Company Limited, hereinafter sometimes referred to as \"the Britannia Company\". On December 23, 1958, the Labour Relations Board, established under the Labour Relations Act, 1954 (B.C.), c. 17, varied the certificate of June 8, 1944, by deleting the name of the Britannia Company each time it appeared therein and substituting in its place the name Howe Sound Company.\nThe details of the arrangement by which the appellant took over the operations formerly carried on by the Britannia Company are not set out in the record before us. The certificate of the Labour Relations Board dated December 23, 1958, contains the recital that the Board is satisfied that the name of the employer has been changed to \"Howe Sound Company\". The factum of the appellant puts the matter as follows:\nThe appellant was successor to Britannia Mining & Smelting Co. Ltd. That company ceased its operations some considerable time before the present agreement came into force and the company dissolved. Subsequently the present company was incorporated and commenced operations and in due course entered into the present Collective Agreement. The respondent had obtained the exclusive right to represent the appellant's employees in collective bargaining by a ruling of the Labour Relations Board dated November 23rd, 1958.\nIn the factum of the respondent it is put as follows:\nThe employer's operation was taken over by the appellant, Howe Sound Company, and the respondent's bargaining certificate from the provincial Labour Relations Board was amended accordingly on December 23, 1958.\nThe Standard Life Assurance Company issued a group pension policy to the Britannia Company dated August 21, 1956. By endorsement, dated February 27, 1959, attached to the policy it is recited that by an assignment dated August 9, 1958, the Britannia Company had assigned all its rights in the policy to the appellant and it is declared and agreed that with effect from the last-mentioned date the person assured and employer under the policy shall be Howe Sound Company.\nThe policy provides pensions and death benefits for employees. The premiums are payable partly by the employees who participate in the plan and partly by the appellant. Pursuant to the policy a certificate and a booklet were given to each participating employee. Membership in the plan was made compulsory for new employees and irrevocable for those who had joined it so long as they continued in the employment of the appellant.\nParagraph 22 of the booklet appears to be in accordance with condition 8 of the policy; it reads as follows:\n22. WHAT HAPPENS IF I LEAVE THE COMPANY'S SERVICE?\n(a) You may take a return of all your contributions with compound interest in cash (See Clause 24);\nor (b) You may take a paid-up deferred retirement benefit for the amount secured by your past contributions with payments commencing at your Normal Retirement Age.\nIf you leave after not less than five years' participation in the Plan as a contributing member and elect option (b), you will also receive the undernoted percentage of the retirement benefit purchased by the Company's contributions on your behalf up to the date of withdrawal, in the form of paid-up retirement benefit at Normal Retirement Age.\nPercentage of retirement\nYears of participation\nbenefit purchased by\nIn the Plan\nthe Company's contributions\n5\n10%\n6\n20%\n7\n30%\n8\n40%\n9\n50%\n10\n60%\n11\n70%\n12\n80%\n13\n90%\n14 (or within 10 years of Normal Retirement Age)\n100%\nParagraph 29 of the booklet reads as follows:\n29. DOES THE PLAN AFFECT MY FUTURE EMPLOYMENT?\nThe Plan does not guarantee you future employment with the Company nor does it in any way restrict the right of the Company to terminate your employment.\nA collective agreement, dated November 27, 1958, and effective from December 1, 1958, was entered into between the appellant and the respondent. This agreement was to remain in effect for two years and to remain in full force thereafter \"until superseded by a new agreement or until negotiations are broken off by failure to agree.\"\nClauses A and B and the opening sentence of clause C of article 16 of the agreement read as follows:\nARTICLE 16.\nGRIEVANCE PROCEDURE:\nA. In the case of any dispute or grievance arising as to the interpretation of this Agreement or any local agreement made in connection there with, whether the dispute or grievance is claimed by the Company to have arisen, or by any persons employed, or by the men as a whole, then the parties shall endeavour to settle the matter as hereinafter provided. But before any grievances or disputes shall be submitted to the Grievance Committee, the person or persons affected shall endeavour, by personal application to the shiftboss or foreman in charge of the work where the dispute arises, to settle the matter. In a case where a workman is making a personal application as referred to above and wishes to be accompanied by one member of the Grievance Committee, he shall be permitted to do so. The first step in the grievance procedure may be submitted in writing.\nB. In the case of any local dispute arising in or about the property of the Company, and which there has been a failure to reach an agreement between the employee and the shiftboss or foreman in charge of the work, the matter shall be submitted in writing to the Grievance Committee for that particular plant and to the Superintendent who shall endeavour to settle the matter and, if they agree, their decision shall be final. In the event of the failure of the Plant Grievance Committee and the Superintendent of the plant or department to settle any dispute so referred to them, the matter in dispute shall be submitted in writing to the Manager, and the representative of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers or the General Grievance Committee of the local Union, and all parties shall endeavour to settle the dispute as speedily as possible; if they agree their decisions shall be final. In the event of their failure to agree, they shall endeavour to select an Arbitration Board of three (3). The arbitrator selected by the Union and the one selected by the Company shall be selected within five (5) working days (excluding Sundays and holidays) following the receipt of the written request originating the arbitration proceedings. Those who are selected shall, within three (3) working days (excluding Sundays and holidays) after the appointment of the last member of the Board, choose an additional member who shall be Chairman. In the event of failure to agree upon the additional member to act as Chairman, the parties involved shall request the Labour Relations Board (B.C.) to appoint the Chairman, further requesting that this appointment be made within seven (7) days of date such request is received (excluding Sundays and holidays). The decision of the Arbitration Board shall be final and binding on both parties, insofar as such decision is not inconsistent with any law, order or directive of any Government, agency of Government, or other body constituted to enact, administer or issue such law, order or directive, and such authority has jurisdiction on the date of the rendering of such decision. In no event shall the Board have the power to alter, modify or amend this Agreement in any respect.\nExpenses and compensation of the arbitrators selected by the parties as members of the Arbitration Board, shall be borne by the respective organizations selecting them. The expense and compensation, if any, of the Chairman of the Arbitration Board shall be divided equally between the parties involved. The Arbitration Board shall establish its own rules of procedure. Such rules, however, must not deny the right of hearing to the parties involved in the dispute.\nC. In the meantime, and in all cases while disputes are being investigated and settled, the employee or employees or all other parties involved must continue to work pending investigation and until final decision has been reached.\nArticle 25 of the agreement reads as follows:\nARTICLE 25\nTHIS AGREEMENT between the Union and the Company is made in recognition of and subject to the provisions of all Dominion and\/or Provincial regulations pertaining thereto and to the laws in force in the Province of British Columbia from time to time.\nArticle 23 of the agreement reads as follows:\nARTICLE 23\nRETIREMENT PLAN:\nThe Company agrees to contribute to a Retirement Benefit Plan in accordance with an agreement between Howe Sound Company and The Standard Life Assurance Company. For the purpose of this Article the Company agrees to recognize past service of those ex-employees of Britannia Mining and Smelting Co. Limited (dissolved) who have not withdrawn from the Plan prior to the date of this agreement.\nUnder date of September 29, 1960, a document headed \"Grievance Report, Local 663, I.U.M.M. & S.W.\" was signed by G. A. Bennett, business agent of the respondent. It reads as follows:\nNature of Grievance.\nThe effect of Article 23 of the current collective agreement signed and agreed between the Howe Sound Company Britannia Division and Local 663, of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelterworkers (Canada) of Britannia Beach, B.C. is to cover all former employees of the Britannia Mining and Smelting Co. Limited (whether such employees were hired by the Howe Sound Company Britannia Division or not) following the shutdown of February 28, 1958 as regards their past service with the Britannia Mining and Smelting Co. Ltd., who had not withdrawn from the Plan prior to the date of the said collective agreement; but the Company has refused to carry out the provisions of Article 23. By letter dated September 29, 1960, Mr. Bennett wrote to Mr. Pringle, the manager of the appellant. This letter reads in part:\nAt our meeting today it was agreed by the Company and the Union that the above grievance be referred to a Board of Arbitration as we had been unable to reach agreement.\nIt has also been mutually agreed that, as discussions had already taken place between Mr. G. A. Bennett, Business Agent of Local 663 and the Management of Howe Sound Company (Britannia Division) the first two stages of grievance proceedings have been completed.\nThe reply to this letter is dated October 5, 1960. It was written by the solicitors for the appellant and reads in part:\nWith reference to the second paragraph of your letter, we wish to advise that the Company reserves the right to take the position before the Board of Arbitration that the alleged grievance is not properly arbitrable under Article 16 of the present Collective Bargaining Agreement. We are strengthened in this position as it appears from the prior discussions which have taken place that this is an attempt on the part of the Union to have determined whether or not certain ex-employees of Britannia Mining and Smelting Co. Limited are still covered by the Group Pension Policy underwritten by The Standard Life Assurance Company. In our opinion, if any ex-employee claims to be entitled to participate in the scheme to a greater extent than to have paid back to him his contributions plus interest, he should begin a court action against the assurance company and our client. A court decision would be binding on all the parties. Such is not the case with respect to a decision of the Board of Arbitration. For example, how could a decision in favour of the Union or the Company bind the assurance company or an ex-employee who has not been rehired by Howe Sound? In these circumstances, we will have to contend before the Board that, in part at least, the matter is not properly a grievance.\nThe appellant has consistently maintained its position that the alleged grievance is not a proper subject for arbitration under the terms of article 16 and I think it clear that by taking part in the arbitration in the manner hereafter mentioned it has not lost its right to assert that the arbitrators have no authority to make an award. It is not necessary to set out the repeated protests made on behalf of the appellant.\nThe law on this point is correctly stated in the following passages in Russell on Arbitration, 16th ed., at pages 162 and 163:\nIf a party to a reference objects that the arbitrators are entering upon the consideration of a matter not referred to them and protests against it, and the arbitrators nevertheless go into the question and receive evidence on it, and the party, still under protest, continues to attend before the arbitrators and cross-examines the witnesses on the point objected to, he does not thereby waive his objection, nor is he estopped from saying that the arbitrators have exceeded their authority by awarding on the matter.\n***\nContinuing to take part in the proceedings after protest made does not amount to consent.\nThe respondent appointed Mr. Harvey Murphy and the appellant appointed Mr. J. A. C. Ross to be members of the board of arbitration. They failed to agree upon a third member and on October 17, 1960, requested the Labour Relations Board to appoint a third member to act as chairman. Pursuant to this request the Labour Relations Board appointed Professor C. B. Bourne.\nIt is stated in the respondent's factum that the board met on November 4, 1960, that counsel for the appellant raised a preliminary objection to the board's jurisdiction, that the board reserved its decision on the objection and adjourned the hearing until November 21, 1960.\nIn a letter to Professor Bourne dated November 9, 1960, the solicitors for the respondent refer to suggestions made by him at \"the first sittings of the Arbitration Board on the 4th instant\". The letter reads in part:\nIn reference to the four specific questions which were asked, I am instructed as follows:\n1. As to the identity of the person or persons on whose behalf the grievance is taken: this grievance is taken by the above Union on behalf of all ex-employees of the Britannia Company who had not, prior to the 1st day of December, 1958, withdrawn from the retirement plan in question. In this connection, it should be made clear that the Union does not propose to arbitrate the case of a single individual, but desires to arbitrate the rights of this group under Section 23.\n2. As to whether the grievance and arbitration are stated under Article 16 A or B: the grievance and arbitration are under Article 16 A.\n3. As to the manner in which it claimed the company has failed to recognize the rights of the ex-employees in question: this, of course, is a matter of evidence which will be presented before the Board at the appropriate time.\n4. As to the issue of whether the dispute is between the parties to the agreement: the Union desires to submit argument on this issue at the appropriate time.\nOn November 18, 1960, the board gave its decision, written by the chairman and concurred in by Mr. Murphy. After reciting the making and reiteration of the appellant's objection to the jurisdiction of the board the reasons continue:\nThe objection is based on the grounds (i) that the Union is making a claim on behalf of persons who are not employees of the Company and are not covered by the collective agreement, and (ii) that the disposition of the claim will involve determining the rights of an insurance company which is not a party to the collective agreement.\nThe dispute is about the meaning of Article 23 of the collective agreement made by the Company and the Union. The Union is contending that by it the Company made certain promises to the Union in relation to former employees of the Britannia Mining & Smelting Co. Ltd., whose successors the Company is, and that those promises are not being fulfilled.\nBy Article 16 of the collective agreement the Company and the Union agreed to arbitrate \"any dispute or grievance arising as to the interpretation of this agreement \u2026whether the dispute or grievance is claimed by any person employed, or by the men as a whole \u2026\" when they fail to reach agreement about such disputes. The Company arg0ues that this article only applies to the grievances of specific present employees.\nThis interpretation of Article 16 is, in my opinion, too restrictive. When the Union entered into the agreement with the Company it was acting on behalf of \"the men as a whole\" and when it alleges that the Company is not complying with an article of the agreement, it is complaining on behalf of \"the men as a whole\". It is not necessary for the Union to show that some particular employee is prejudiced. If the Company fails to carry out any term of the collective agreement, it is a matter of concern for the whole body of employees covered by the agreement and they have a grievance even though the immediate beneficiary of the promise by the Company may be a third party to the agreement. I hold, therefore, that the grievance of the Union, involving as it does the interpretation of an article of the collective agreement, comes within the provisions of Article 16.\nThe objection that the rights of third parties are involved is also, in my opinion, not sufficient ground for holding that the Board cannot deal with the dispute between the parties, to this collective agreement. It is true that the decision of the Board cannot affect the rights of third parties. But that is not sufficient reason for the Board's refusing to declare the rights of the parties to the collective agreement as provided for by Article 16. In any case, at the present stage of this arbitration, before the hearing has even started, it is not certain that any rights of third parties will be adversely affected by anything the Board decides.\nMy decision, then, is that the Board has jurisdiction to proceed with the hearing of the Union's grievance.\nIt is stated in the respondent's factum that the board reconvened on November 21, 1960, that at the board's request counsel agreed on a formulation of the issue before it, that the union called its first witness and the proceedings stopped upon the board being served with the notice of motion for a writ of certiorari. The issue formulated reads as follows:\nQuestion Before Board\nNovember 21,1960.\nDoes Article 23 of the Collective Agreement dated December 1, 1958 impose on the Company the obligation to make pension contributions for past service of ex-employees of Britannia Mining and Smelting Co., Limited who had not withdrawn prior to the date of the agreement from the Retirement Benefit Plan referred to in that Article and who have not been rehired by the Company since that date?\nJohn Stanton\nCounsel for Local 663\nI U M M S W\nUnder Protest\nas recorded\nA. W. Fisher.\nIt is said in the appellant's factum that at the hearing before McInnes J. counsel for the respondent stated that none of the persons referred to in the question quoted above had been hired by the appellant.\nThe grounds set out in the notice of motion are lengthy but they are really little more than repetitions in various forms of ground 1(a) which reads as follows:\n(a) There was no statement before the said Board or submission to it of a dispute or grievance between the said Company and the said Union or any other person, persons or body of persons entitled to claim the benefit of the collective agreement between the said Company and the said Union dated the 27th day of November, 1958;\nAfter reading the whole record with care I am unable to say just what it is of which the union complains. It is, I think, to be regretted that the board did not require the union to state plainly what it asserts the company has done or has failed to do in contravention of the combined effect of article 23 of the collective agreement and the agreement with the Standard Life Assurance Company referred to therein. Arbitrators have implied power to order each party to deliver particulars so as to define the actual point or points in dispute between the parties; see Russell on Arbitration, 16th ed., at pages 150 and 151. However, this was not done and we must deal with the matter on the material before us. The proceedings in the courts below have followed a somewhat unusual course. Substantially the only question raised on the motion before McInnes J. was whether the board had jurisdiction to determine the matter referred to it, but at the commencement of his reasons the learned judge says:\nAt the outset objection was taken by counsel for the company to the jurisdiction of the Board to hear and determine the matter referred to it. In the view that I take of the matter it is not necessary to determine the question of jurisdiction and I will assume for the purposes of this judgment that the Board had jurisdiction without necessarily so finding.\nThe learned Judge goes on to consider the terms of the collective agreement and certain sections of the Labour Relations Act and says in part:\nThe plain meaning and intent of the whole agreement, and particularly Articles 16 and 23, is that employees of the present company who were formerly employed by the Britannia company shall retain the full benefits to which they were entitled under the pension plan which was in existence between the old company and its employees. No other meaning is possible or was ever intended to be conveyed by the terms of the present Collective Agreement and in particular, Article 23 thereof.\nWith the greatest respect, that was not the question which the learned Judge was called upon to decide; his function was to determine whether or not the board had jurisdiction to decide it.\nIn the result McInnes J. ordered that the ruling of the board be quashed.\nIn the Court of Appeal, for the first time, the question was raised whether certiorari would lie against this arbitration board; that Court held unanimously that it would not and consequently allowed the appeal without dealing with any other questions.\nThe issue is succinctly stated in the following paragraph in the reasons of Tysoe J.A.:\nCertiorari does not lie against an arbitrator or arbitration board unless the arbitrator or board is a statutory arbitrator or statutory board; that is a person or board to whom by Statute the parties must resort. Prerogative Writs of Certiorari and Prohibition do not go to ordinary private arbitration boards set up by agreement of parties: R. v. National Joint Council for the Craft of Dental Technicians [1953] 1 Q.B. 704. We must, therefore, decide whether this arbitration board is a private arbitration body set up by agreement, or a statutory board. In R. v. National Joint Council for the Craft of Dental Technicians[3], Lord Goddard says at pages 707 and 708:\nBut the bodies to which in modern times the remedies of these prerogative writs have been applied have all been statutory bodies on whom Parliament has conferred statutory powers and duties which, when exercised, may lead to the detriment of subjects who may have to submit to their jurisdiction.\nand at page 708:\nThere is no instance of which I know in the books where certiorari has gone to any arbitrator except a statutory arbitrator, and a statutory arbitrator is one to whom by Statute the parties must resort.\nI did not understand counsel for the appellant to question the accuracy of these passages as general statements of the law. He submitted, however, that by the combined effect of ss. 21, 22, 24 and 60 of the Labour Relations Act the arbitration board set up under article 16 of the collective agreement is, in substance, a statutory board to which by statute the parties must resort. He argued that while its creation is provided for and its powers are conferred upon it by the agreement and two of its members are appointed by the parties and the third pursuant to the request of those two, all these things are agreed to not of the free will of the parties but under the compulsion of the statute. In support of this submission the appellant relies, amongst others, on the case of Re International Nickel Company of Canada Limited and Rivando[4], a unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nWhether this argument is entitled to prevail must depend chiefly on the wording of the statute which is said to compel the creation of the tribunal and to require the parties to resort to it, and there are differences between the Ontario legislation and that in force in British Columbia.\nThe sections of the Labour Relations Act upon which the appellant relies read as follows:\n21. Every person who is bound by a collective agreement, whether entered into before or after the coming into force of this Act, shall do everything he is required to do, and shall refrain from doing anything that he is required to refrain from doing, by the provisions of the collective agreement, and failure to so do or refrain from so doing is an offence against this Act. 22. (1) Every collective agreement entered into after the commencement of this Act shall contain a provision for final and conclusive settlement without stoppage of work, by arbitration or otherwise, of all differences between the persons bound by the agreement concerning its interpretation, application, operation, or any alleged violation thereof.\n(2) Where a collective agreement, whether entered into before or after the commencement of this Act, does not contain a provision as required by this section, the Minister shall by order prescribe a provision for such purpose, and a provision so prescribed shall be deemed to be a term of the collective agreement and binding on all persons bound by the agreement.\n24. Each of the parties to a collective agreement shall forthwith, upon its execution, file one copy with the Minister.\n60. Every trade-union, employers' organization, or person who does anything prohibited by this Act, or who refuses or neglects to do anything required by this Act to be done by him, is guilty of an offence and, except where some other penalty is by this Act provided for the act, refusal, or neglect, is liable, on summary conviction:\n(a) if an individual, to a fine not exceeding fifty dollars; or\n(b) if a corporation, trade-union, or employers' organization, to a fine not exceeding two hundred and fifty dollars.\nCounsel for the appellant argues that the provision in the agreement that the decision of the arbitration board shall be final, read in the light of s. 22 (1) of the Act requiring \"a provision for final and conclusive settlement \u2026of all differences\", has the effect of prohibiting recourse to the courts by either party to question the jurisdiction of the board or the validity of its award, and thus leaves prohibition and certiorari as the only available remedies.\nEven if the agreement did not contain article 25 and the concluding sentence of the first paragraph of clause B of article 16, quoted above, it would be my opinion that words clearer than those used in the agreement and in the statute would be necessary to have the effect of ousting the jurisdiction of the courts. In my view it is open to the parties should occasion arise, to question the jurisdiction of the board or the validity of any award it makes in such manner as is permitted by the Arbitration Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 14 or by the common law.\nFor these reasons and those given by Tysoe J.A., with which I am in substantial agreement, I have reached the conclusion that this arbitration board is not one to which certiorari lies and that consequently the appeal fails. I share the view of Tysoe J.A. that the question of what the situation would be should the parties to a collective agreement fail to include in it a provision for final and conclusive settlement without stoppage of work so as to bring into operation the provisions of subs. (2) of s. 22 of the Labour Relations Act should be reserved for future consideration.\nIt is to be regretted that after hearings in three Courts the parties have not received an answer to the question whether the board has jurisdiction to deal with the matter submitted to it but having held that certiorari does not lie it seems to me that we can only do as the Court of Appeal did and leave the parties to whatever recourse they may have.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Davis, Hossie, Campbell, Brazier & McLorg, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Stanton & Buckley, Vancouver.\n[1] (1961-62), 36 W.W.R. 181, 29 D.L.R.

Attorney General of Canada, [1962] S.C.R. 331\nDate: 1962-03-26\nNick Nykorak (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nThe Attorney General of Canada (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1962: February 5, 6; 1962: March 26.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nConstitutional law\u2014Master and Servant\u2014Injury to member of the armed forces of Canada\u2014Action per quod servitium amisit by Crown\u2014Whether action lies under s. 50 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98\u2014Validity of s. 50.\nAn action was brought on behalf of the Crown to recover damages in respect of the loss of the services of a member of the Canadian armed forces, due to the defendant's negligence. The Attorney General succeeded at the trial and on appeal. The defendant appealed to this Court on two grounds: (i) that the action per quod servitium amisit does not lie at the suit of the Crown under s. 50 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98, which establishes the master and servant relationship between the Brown and a member of the armed services, and (ii) that the section is beyond the powers of the Parliament of Canada.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: As far as members of the armed forces are concerned it was decided in The King v. Richardson, [1948] S.C.R. 57, that s. 50 of the Exchequer Court Act does entitle the Crown to bring the per quod action for disbursements for medical and hospital expenses and pay and allowances. Attorney General of Canada v. Jackson, [1946] S.C.R. 489, referred to.\nWith the present use of mechanized vehicles by the military forces, the public interest required that the Crown should be in the same position as any other master for the torts of its servants committed in the course of their employment. If the Crown was to assume this responsibility to the public, there was every reason to insist on a reciprocal right of recovery for expenses incurred as a result of injury to the statutory servant and legislation of the nature of s. 50 came squarely under head 7 (militia, military and naval service and defence) of s. 91 of the British North America Act, notwithstanding the fact that it might incidentally affect property and civil rights within the province.\nPer Locke and Ritchie JJ.: The question as to the right of the Crown to recover for the loss of services of members of the armed forces of Canada must be taken to have been determined in The King v. Richardson, supra. Taylor v. Neri (1795), 1 Esp. 386, referred to.\nTo declare the nature of the relationship existing between the Crown and members of the armed forces for any or for all purposes is legislation in relation to the matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament under head 7 of s. 91 of the British North America Act and, accordingly, intra vires. This does not depend upon any such ground as that to do this is necessarily incidental to the powers of Parliament under head 7: it is a direct dealing with the matter within such powers.\nSection 50 does not purport to create a direct and specific right in the Crown but simply purports to place the Crown in a recognized common law relation, and its rights are those arising from that relation under the rules of that law. The relation of master and servant existed between the Crown and soldiers and non-commissioned officers of the armed forces, whose employment is authorized and regulated by the National Defence Act within the ordinary meaning of these expressions, prior to the enactment of s. 50 and the section does nothing more than declare that to be the case. This was not to say that such relationship supports an action per quod: but that it does was decided by the judgment of this Court in Richardson's case.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming a judgment of Macfarlane J. for the Crown in an action per quod. Appeal dismissed.\nM. M. McFarlane, Q.C., and G. S. Cumming, for the defendant, appellant. C. R. Munro, and J. D. Lambert, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The Attorney General of Canada sued the defendant for expenses incurred by the Crown as a result of a motor car accident in which a soldier was injured. The defendant was found wholly to blame for the accident. The expenses were $867.45 for medical and hospital treatment and $563 for the soldier's pay and allowances paid by the Crown during his period of incapacity. The soldier himself recovered damages for his personal injuries and that question is not involved in the appeal. The Attorney General succeeded at the trial and on appeal[2] and the defendant now appeals to this Court on two grounds, namely, that the action per quod servitium amisit does not lie at the suit of the Crown under s. 50 of the Exchequer Court Act and that the section is beyond the powers of the Parliament of Canada. The section reads:\nFor the purpose of determining liability in any action or other proceeding by or against Her Majesty, a person who was at any time since the 24th day of June, 1938, a member of the naval, army or air forces of Her Majesty in right of Canada shall be deemed to have been at such time a servant of the Crown.\nIt was enacted following the decision in McArthur v. The King[3], in which a claim against the Crown under s. 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act had been rejected on the ground that a soldier whose negligence was in question was not a servant of the Crown. The meaning of s. 50 is plain. It legislates away the McArthur decision and it also applies to proceedings brought by the Crown. In both cases the member of the armed forces is deemed to be a servant of the Crown.\nThe argument now put forward is that the legislation has succeeded in imposing liability on the Crown on the ground of a master and servant relationship but has failed in its attempt to enlarge the rights of the Crown because it still does not make the soldier into the kind of servant for loss of whose services the per quod action will lie. It is unnecessary here to repeat the detailed historical surveys of this form of action which are to be found in Attorney-General for New South Wales v. Perpetual Trustee Co. (Ltd.)[4], and Commissioner for Railways (N.S.W.) v. Scott[5] As far as members of the armed forces are concerned it was decided in The King v. Richardson[6], that s. 50 does entitle the Crown to bring this action for disbursements for medical and hospital expenses and pay and allowances. This decision was foreshadowed in Attorney-General of Canada v. Jackson[7], where the Crown's claim failed only because the soldier himself, as a gratuitous passenger, had no cause of action against the driver of the car in which he was a passenger. That is all that these cases decide but they are conclusive of the present case. The result follows on the plain meaning of the enactment which merely says to a wrongdoer that it is not cheaper to injure a soldier than a civilian because the Crown assumes to look after a soldier during his period of disability.\nThe constitutional argument is that s. 50 of the Exchequer Court Act does not deal with the relations between the Crown and a soldier in such a way as to bring the matter within head 7 of s. 91 and that it is legislation in relation to matters falling within subss. 13 and 16 of s. 92 of the British North America Act. The submission is that the true nature of the legislation is to create a legal relationship between the Crown and a member of the services for the purpose of conferring civil rights of action upon the Crown and upon third persons, and that the creation of the relation of master and servant provided in the section is not necessary to the exercise of full legislative power over militia, military and naval service and defence.\nThere can be no question of the Crown's right to assume liability for the conduct of a member of the armed forces based upon a relationship of master and servant. The only possible constitutional objection to s. 50 must be to the imposition of liability upon a member of the public in the circumstances of the Richardson case. The only previous mention of this matter is in the judgment of Kellock J. in the Jackson case, supra, at p. 496, where he expressed the opinion that the legislation was within s. 91(7). He followed Grand Trunk Railway of Canada v. Attorney-General of Canada[8], where Dominion legislation in relation to the terms of employment imposed by railway companies within Dominion jurisdiction upon their employees was upheld as being a law ancillary to railway legislation notwithstanding the fact that it affected civil rights within the province.\nThe appellant's argument in this case seems to me to be unduly restrictive of Parliament's exclusive jurisdiction under s. 91 (7). Military forces cannot operate now in this day of mechanization without using all the means of communication that are available. They do not operate in isolation in camps or on routes over which they have exclusive use. They are part and parcel of the everyday life of the country. With this use of mechanized vehicles, the public interest requires that the Crown should be in the same position as any other master for the torts of its servants committed in the course of their employment. If the Crown is to assume this responsibility to the public, there is every reason to insist on a reciprocal right of recovery for expenses incurred as a result of injury to the statutory servant and legislation of this kind comes squarely under head 7 of s. 91, notwithstanding the fact that it may incidentally affect property and civil rights within the province. It is meaningless to support this legislation, as was done in the Grand Trunk case, on the ground that it is \"necessarily incidental\" to legislation in relation to an enumerated class of subject in s. 91.\nIt is also of some significance that the Attorney-General of British Columbia, although duly notified, did not appear in the proceedings in the provincial courts and that when, pursuant to an order of the Chief Justice of Canada, notice was served on the Attorney-General of each province, none of them chose to intervene in this Court.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Locke and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014This action was brought on behalf of the Crown to recover damages in respect of the loss of the services of Corporal E. E. Sims of the Royal Canadian Air Force, due to the negligence of the appellant. Sims was serving at the Royal Canadian Air Force station at Sea Island where he was employed as an airframe mechanic.\nAs a member of the armed forces of Canada his relations with the Crown and his duties as a soldier were subject to and regulated by the provisions of the National Defence Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 184, and regulations made under that statute. Section 50 of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 98, provides that, for the purpose of determining liability in any action or other proceeding by or against Her Majesty, a person who was at any time since June 24, 1938, a member of the naval, army or air forces of Her Majesty in right of Canada shall be deemed to have been at such time a servant of the Crown.\nThat portion of the section which refers to actions against the Crown appears to have been added as an amendment to the Act following the decision in McArthur v. The King[9], in which the President of the Exchequer Court had held that a member of the non-permanent active militia of Canada on active service was not an officer or servant of the Crown, within the meaning of s. 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 34. That decision did not afford any reason for the reference in the amendment to the status of such persons for the purpose of determining liability in an action brought by the Crown.\nIn my opinion, the question as to the right of the Crown to recover for the loss of services of members of the armed forces of Canada, such as Sims, must be taken to have been determined by the judgment of this Court in The King v. Richardson[10]. There the soldier for the loss of whose services the action was brought was a second lieutenant who was injured in a motor vehicle accident. In the Exchequer Court[11], O'Connor J. decided that the action did not lie at the suit of the Crown for the loss of the services of a member of the armed forces. That decision was reversed by the unanimous decision of this Court. It is, however, said that a contention advanced by the appellant in this matter, that the action per quod servitium amisit is restricted to cases where the servant is employed in a menial or domestic capacity, was not considered. The authority for this argument is the decision of Chief Justice Eyre in Taylor v. Neri[12], which has been referred to with approval in the Court of Appeal in Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Hambrook[13]. Eyre C.J. is reported to have said in that case that the person whose services were said to have been lost and who was a hired singer was not a servant at all.\nI have examined the case and the factums in Richardson's case in this Court and while it is true that Neri's case is not mentioned in either factum the subject was canvassed extensively in the factum filed on behalf of the Crown and dealt with at length in the judgments delivered in this Court, and the question should be taken to be concluded.\nThe appellant's contention that s. 50, in so far as it declares that members of the armed forces shall be deemed to be servants of the Crown for the purpose of determining liability in actions brought by Her Majesty is ultra vires, is, in my opinion, ill founded.\nThis question was raised in this Court in the case of Attorney-General of Canada v. Jackson[14], but in that matter it was unnecessary to decide the point since the action for the loss of the services of a soldier on active service failed on the ground that the soldier himself had no right of action against the defendant. The question was, however, discussed by Kellock J. who considered that the section could be supported under head 7 of s. 91 of the British North America Act. Militia, military and naval service and defence under that heading are declared to be within the exclusive legislative authority of Parliament.\nIn my opinion, to declare the nature of the relationship existing between the Crown and members of the armed forces for any or for all purposes is legislation in relation to the matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament under head 7 and, accordingly, intra vires. This does not depend, in my view, upon any such ground as that to do this is necessarily incidental to the powers of Parliament under head 7: it is a direct dealing with the matter within such powers. As pointed out by Kellock J. in Richardson's case (p. 67), the section does not purport to create a direct and specific right in the Crown but simply purports to place the Crown in a recognized common law relation, and its rights are those arising from that relation under the rules of that law. I am of the opinion that the relation of master and servant existed between the Crown and soldiers and non-commissioned officers of the armed forces, whose employment is authorized and regulated by the National Defence Act within the ordinary meaning of these expressions, prior to the enactment of s. 50 and that that section does nothing more than declare that to be the case. This is not to say that such relationship supports an action per quod: but that it does is decided by the judgment of this Court.\nThe earlier decision of this Court in Larose v. The King, dealing with the status of a member of the militia established under the Militia Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 41, turned upon considerations which do not apply in the present matter.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Cumming, Bird & Purvis, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, respondent: E.

Dubin, Q.C., and Michael O\u2019Brien and Polymer Corporation Limited (Defendants) Respondents.\n1961: November 20; 1962: March 26.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke, Cartwright and Martland JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nLabour\u2014Collective agreement\u2014Breach by union of no-strike clause\u2014Power of arbitration board to award and assess damages\u2014Certiorari proceedings. A collective agreement entered into by a union and a company (the labour relations between the company and its employees being governed by the Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 152) provided a procedure for the disposition of grievances, and grievances not settled could be referred to a board of arbitration. The latter was not to have power to alter or change any of the provisions of the agreement or to give any decision inconsistent therewith. A board of arbitration considered an alleged breach by the union of a no-strike clause in the agreement; it decided that there had been such a breach, that the union was responsible and liable in damages for it, and directed that the amount of damages be determined after a further hearing.\nSubsequently the union challenged the authority of the board to award and assess damages against the union for this breach of the agreement. The board, by a majority award, rejected this challenge to its authority and the union then launched a motion for an order of certiorari and prohibition directed to the board\u2019s members. The judgment dismissing the motion was affirmed by the Court of Appeal and by leave of that Court the union further appealed. It was submitted that the jurisdiction of the board in dealing with the dispute was limited to making a finding as to whether or not the union had violated \u201cthe no-strike clause\u201d and that the board was without power to award any consequential relief.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe argument of counsel for the appellant that the agreement gave no express power to the board to award and assess damages and that the Courts below had erred in construing the agreement as giving such a power failed.\nHaving reached the opinion that the motion was rightly dismissed on the merits, no opinion was expressed as to whether it might have been dismissed in limine on the procedural objection had it been taken that a board of arbitration proceeding under the Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act is not a public tribunal with respect to whose decisions certiorari lies.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming a judgment of McRuer C.J.H.C. dismissing an application for an order of certiorari and prohibition directed to the members of a board of labour arbitration. Appeal dismissed.\nDavid Lewis, Q.C., and T.E. Armstrong, for the appellants.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., and J.W. Healy, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This appeal is brought, pursuant to leave granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, from a judgment of that Court1 affirming a judgment of McRuer C.J.H.C. which dismissed the appellants\u2019 motion for an order of certiorari and prohibition directed to the respondents Laskin, Dubin and O\u2019Brien, members of a board of arbitration, hereinafter sometimes referred to as \u201cthe board\u201d.\nThe respondent Polymer Corporation Limited, hereinafter referred to as \u201cPolymer\u201d entered into a collective agreement with Oil, Chemical and Atomic International Union, Local 16-14, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe union\u201d, which was to remain in force from February 27, 1957, to July 7, 1958, and to be automatically renewed from year to year thereafter unless a specified notice was given.\nThe labour relations between Polymer and its employees are governed by the Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 152.\nParagraph 8.01 of the collective agreement is as follows:\n8.01\u2014\nThe Union agrees that during the life of the agreement there will be no strike and the Company agrees that there will be no lockout.\nOn February 7, 1958, there was a stoppage of work at the plant and on February 10, 1958, Polymer filed a written grievance with the union reading as follows:\nThis grievance is submitted to the Union under Article 6.05 of the Agreement.\nThe Company alleges violation of Article 8.01 of the Agreement by reason of the strike which occurred on Friday, February 7th, 1958. The Company claims full compensation for its losses suffered as a result of this violation.\nThe parties failed to settle the grievance and Polymer requested in writing that it be submitted to arbitration in accordance with article 7.01 of the agreement which reads as follows:\n7.01\u2014\nBoth parties to this Agreement agree that any alleged misinterpretation or violation of the provisions of this Agreement, including any grievance which has been carried through the prescribed steps of the Grievance Procedure outlined in Article VI and which has not been settled, will be referred to a Board of Arbitration at the written request of either of the parties hereto, provided that such requests must be received not later than ten (10) regular working days after a decision has been rendered as provided in step 3 of the Grievance Procedure. The board of arbitration was established in accordance with the relevant provisions of the agreement. By an award dated September 4, 1958, Messrs. Laskin and O\u2019Brien, decided that there had been a violation of article 8.01 of the agreement, that the union was responsible for such breach and liable in damages for it and directed that the amount of damages be determined after a further hearing.\nSubsequently the union challenged the authority of the board to award and assess damages against the union for this breach of the collective agreement. After hearing further argument and receiving written submissions on this point, the board issued a majority award dated November 10, 1959, which rejected the challenge to the board\u2019s power to award damages and stated that the board would proceed to assess the damages at a hearing to be convened. The union then launched the motion which was heard by McRuer C.J.H.C.\nOther provisions of the collective agreement relevant to the question whether the board has jurisdiction to award damages are as follows:\n6.01\u2014(in part)\nParties to this Agreement are agreed that it is of the utmost importance to adjust grievances and disputes as quickly as possible.\n* * *\n6.05\u2014\nAny dispute arising between the Company and the Union regarding the administration, interpretation, alleged violation, or application of this Agreement may be submitted in writing by either party as Step No. 3 of the Grievance Procedure.\n* * *\n7.03\u2014\nThe Board of Arbitration shall not have power to alter or change any of the provisions of this Agreement or to substitute any new provisions for any existing provisions nor to give any decision inconsistent with the terms and provisions of this Agreement.\n7.04\u2014\nThe decision of the majority shall be the decision of the Arbitration Board, and shall be binding upon both parties.\nThe main argument of counsel for the appellant is that the agreement gives no express power to the board to award and assess damages and that the Courts below have erred in construing the agreement as giving such a power. He submits that the jurisdiction of the board in dealing with the dispute formulated in the written grievance filed by Polymer was limited to making a finding as to whether or not the union had violated \u201cthe no-strike clause\u201d in the agreement and that the board was without power to award any consequential relief.\nOn this branch of the matter I find myself, as did the Court of Appeal, in complete agreement with the reasons of McRuer C.J.H.C. and for the reasons given by him I would dismiss the appeal.\nBefore parting with the matter mention should be made of an alternative ground on which it is submitted in the factum of the respondent that the appeal should be dismissed. It is stated as follows:\nA Board of Arbitration proceeding under the Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act is not a public tribunal with respect to whose decisions certiorari lies.\nWhile counsel for the respondent did not press this point he did not abandon it; in reply counsel for the appellant relied chiefly on the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Re International Nickel Company of Canada Limited and Rivando[2].\nIt is not necessary to deal with this point and, in my opinion, we should not do so.\nThere is nothing in the reasons delivered in the Courts below to indicate that the point was taken there. Early in his reasons the learned Chief Justice of the High Court says:\nThe only point at issue in this application is whether the Board of Arbitration has power to award and assess damages for breach of the collective agreement.\nHad the point that certiorari does not lie been raised before the learned Chief Justice I think it certain that he would have mentioned it and probable that he would have dealt with it before considering on its merits the question whether the board had jurisdiction to award damages; but he would not have been bound to follow that course. If he had seen fit he might have first considered the merits and if on the merits the motion failed it would have become unnecessary to deal with the procedural point. If, on the other hand, he had reached the conclusion on the merits that the board did not have jurisdiction to award damages, it would then have become necessary to determine whether the board was a tribunal to which certiorari would lie. The merits were fully inquired into in the Courts below and in the argument before us, and having reached the opinion that the motion was rightly dismissed on the merits I express no opinion as to whether it might have been dismissed in limine on the procedural objection had it been taken.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Jolliffe, Lewis & Osler, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Miller, Thompson, Hicks, Sedgewick, Lewis & Healy, Toronto.\n[1] [1961] O.R. 438, 28 D.L.R.

Before the purchase, they had the building examined by architects and engineers who noticed a bulge on the front wall which they regarded as of no importance. After the purchase, the plaintiffs made extensive alterations and discovered that a structural defect was causing the front wall to bulge. This wall had to be partly rebuilt and the plaintiffs sued to recover the cost of the additional work caused by the structural defect. The trial judge dismissed the action and this judgment was affirmed by a majority in the Court of Queen's Bench. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. Assuming that the sale was one made with full legal warranty, the sole question in issue was whether the defect was a latent defect within the meaning of art. 1522 of the Civil Code. The Courts below rightly held that it was not such.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming by a majority a judgment of Ralston J. Appeal dismissed.\nH. L. Aronovitch, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nAlbert Bissonnette, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014In their action appellants claim a sum of $12,000 as damages suffered as the result of an alleged latent defect in a building in the city of Montreal purchased by them from respondent. The action was dismissed by the learned trial judge and that judgment was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench2, Choquette and Montgomery JJ. dissenting.\nThe facts, as to which the parties are in substantial agreement, are concisely set forth in the reasons of Montgomery J. as follows:\nThe building in question is located on the westerly side of St. Urbain Street (civic No. 950) and was sold to Appellants with legal warranty by deed dated 4th January 1952, for a price of $140,000. Respondent had acquireed it from its predecessor company, Frank W. Horner Limited (1912), for which the building had been constructed.\nThe building, as it was when sold to Appellants, had been constructed in four stages, designated by the witness Bernstein stages A, B, C, and D. These stages are shown on four drawings filed as Exhibit P-8. There are also photographs, one (Exhibit D-2) showing the building as it was after the first addition (stage B) and three (Exhibit D-1) showing it as it was at the time of the trial. (These drawings and photographs are not reproduced in the joint case, but I have examined them in the original record.)\nThe original building, as constructed in 1916 or shortly thereafter, comprised the first three floors of the southerly half of the building as it now is. In 1919 a fourth storey was added (stage B). The front wall of this new storey was supported on a beam or slab of concrete 12 inches thick by 5 feet high and extending across the whole front of the building. In 1922 or 1923 the northerly half of the building was added (stage C). This was built against the existing northerly wall, which was not demolished.\nUp to this point, almost the entire front of the building as originally constructed was made up of a single window on a steel frame. The new part of the building had smaller windows with brick between. The proprietors apparently wishing to make the appearance of the building more uniform, partly bricked over this large window (stage D). This was done very shortly after the completion of the new part. When they bought the building Appellants intended to make extensive alterations and, particularly, to; remove the wall between the old and new Parts. Before buying it, they had it examined by an architect, the witness Bernstein, and an engineer, the witness Berenstein. Starting in April, 1952, the proposed alterations were carried out by Frank & Pascal, general contractors, under the direction of the witness Frank. In the process of removing the interior wall, the contractors discovered that the concrete beam supporting the front wall of the fourth storey had tilted, so that the lower part had moved outward and was pushing out the brickwork. They also discovered the steel-framed window behind the bricks on the front of the original building This situation was reported to the architect Bernstein and the engineer Berenstein and, on their recommendation, the front of the southerly part of the building was rebuilt. For this additional work, Appellants paid 18,445.03 to the contractors plus a fee of $42255 to the architect.\nAppellants' witnesses testified that the concrete beam above referred to had not been properly anchored and that the brickwork over the window was of varying thickness and not properly bonded to the pre-existing structure. It was established in evidence, and both Courts below have so found, that there was a bulge in the exterior brickwork in the vicinity of the concrete beam which had been observed by appellants' architect and engineer when they examined the property, but which they regarded as of no importance. An architect called on behalf of respondent testified that had he noticed such a bulge he would have suspected that there was some structural defect and would have made further investigation which would, in his opinion, have revealed the defects of which appellants complained. There is no suggestion of bad faith on the part of either appellants or respondent.\nThe building had been built originally about 1916, an additional storey was added and various other structural changes made in the intervening years. After purchasing the property appellants made further extensive alterations at a cost of approximately $80,000, of which they attributed $8,867.28 as being the cost of additional work caused by the structural defect complained of.\nAlthough appellants did not ask to be furnished with the plans of the building until after the purchase had been completed, they did have it examined by an architect and an engineer. The bulge in the front wall was apparent to the latter but, as I have stated, they considered it to be of no consequence. In fact, as found by the trial judge it indicated the existence of, and was caused by, the structural defect complained of by appellants. Assuming as I do, but without deciding, that the sale was one made with full legal warranty, the sole question in issue here is whether the defect complained of was a latent defect within the meaning of art. 1522 of the Civil Code. The learned trial judge and the majority in the Court below have held that it was not and I am in respectful agreement with that finding.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs, appellants: Chait & Aronovitch, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: Stikeman & Elliott, Montreal.\n1 [1961] Que.

The Minister of National Revenue\nCollection\nSupreme Court Judgments\nDate\n1962-03-26\nReport\n[1962] SCR 346\nJudges\nTaschereau, Robert; Locke, Charles Holland; Cartwright, John Robert; Martland, Ronald; Judson, Wilfred\nOn appeal from\nCanada\nSubjects\nTaxation\nDecision Content\nSupreme Court of Canada\nIrrigation Industries Ltd. v. The Minister of National Revenue, [1962] S.C.R. 346\nDate: 1962-03-26\nIrrigation Industries Limited Appellant;\nand\nThe Minister of National Revenue Respondent.\n1961: October 25; 1962: March 26.\nPresent: Taschereau, Locke, Cartwright, Martland and Judson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nTaxation\u2014Income tax\u2014Capital gain or income\u2014Mining shares purchased by company\u2014Profit on resale\u2014Whether transaction \"an adventure or concern in the nature of trade\"\u2014Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148 ss. 3, 4 and 139(1)(e).\nThe original purpose of the promoters of the appellant company, incorporated in 1947, was to erect a mill for the dehydration of alfalfa, but this object was abandoned by August 1948. The company remained inactive until 1952 when it acquired an office building. In the following year it purchased directly from a mining company 4,000 treasury shares of an initial issue by that company of 500,000 shares. The appellant resold the shares within a few months and thereby realized a total profit of $26,897.50. This profit was taxed by the Minister on a reassessment of the appellant for the taxation year 1953. The Minister's reassessment was upheld by the Tax Appeal Board and by the Exchequer Court, where it was held that the transaction in question was an adventure in the nature of trade and that the profit arising from it was taxable under the applicable sections of the Income Tax Act, R.S.G. 1952, c. 148. The appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright and Judson JJ dissenting): The appeal should be allowed. Per Taschereau, Locke and Martland JJ.: The transaction in question did not fall within either of the positive tests which the authorities have suggested should be applied in determining whether or not a particular transaction does or does not constitute an adventure in the nature of trade, i.e., (1) whether the person dealt with the property purchased by. him in the same way as a dealer would ordinarily do, and (2) whether the nature and quantity of the subject-matter of the transaction may exclude the possibility that its sale was the realization of an investment or otherwise of a capital nature, or that it could have been disposed of otherwise than as a trade transaction. Minister of National Revenue v. Taylor, [1956] C.T.C. 189; The Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Livingston (1926), 11 Tax Cas. 538; Leeming v. Jones, [1930] 1 K.B. 279, referred to.\nThe appellant's operations in purchasing and selling the shares did not constitute the sort of trading which would be carried on ordinarily by those engaged in the business of trading in securities. What the appellant did was to acquire a capital interest in a new corporate business venture, in a manner which had the characteristics of the making of an investment, and subsequently to dispose, by sale, of that interest.\nAlthough it might be contended that persons may make a business merely of the buying and selling of securities without being traders in securities in the ordinary sense, and that the transactions involved in that kind of business are similar, except in number, to that which occurred here, it had, however, been pointed out in Californian Copper Syndicate v. Harris (1904), 5 Tax Cas. 159, that, where the realization of securities is involved, the taxability of enhanced values depends on whether such realization was an act done in the carrying on of a business.\nThe nature and quantity of the property in question were not indicative of an adventure in the nature of trade. Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Fraser (1942), 24 Tax Cas. 498; Edwards v. Bairstow, [1956] A.C. 14, referred to.\nThe test, applied by the trial judge, whether the appellant entered into the transaction with the intention of disposing of the shares at a profit so soon as there was a reasonable opportunity of so doing, standing alone, was not sufficient to determine whether or not the transaction constituted an adventure in the nature of trade. An accretion to capital does not become income merely because the original capital was invested in the hope and expectation that it would rise in value; if it does so rise, its realization does not make it income. Leeming v. Jones, [1930] 1 K.B. 279 and [1930] A.C. 415, referred to.\nPer Cartwright and Judson JJ., dissenting: The finding of fact made by the trial judge that the purchase of the shares was not an investment, but a purely speculative purchase, and was entered into with the intention of disposing of the stock at a profit as soon as there was a reasonable opportunity of so doing was justified by the evidence and should be accepted.\nWhile the guides formulated in Minister of National Revenue v. Taylor, supra, as to the meaning of the phrase \"adventure or concern in the nature of trade\" were helpful, it was there recognized \"that the question whether a particular transaction is an adventure in the nature of trade depends on its character and surrounding circumstances and no single criterion can be formulated.\" That the transaction in question here was an adventure did not admit of doubt. Equally, it was \"in the nature of trade\". The profit realized was not the enhancement in price of an ordinary investment but rather \"a gain made in an operation of business in carrying out a scheme for profit making.\" Californian Copper Syndicate v. Harris, supra; Regal Heights Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1960] S.C.R. 902, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Cameron J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, affirming a reassessment made by the Minister of National Revenue. Appeal allowed, Cartwright and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nDonald McLaws, Q.C., for the appellant.\nG. W. Ainslie and J. R. H. Tucker, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Locke and Martland JJ. was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Cameron J.2, who dismissed the appellant's appeal from a decision of the Tax Appeal Board, which had affirmed the reassessment of the appellant for the taxation year 1953.\nThe facts are outlined in the judgment of my brother Cartwright and I will not repeat them here in full. There are, however, two matters which should be mentioned. The first is that the shares of Brunswick Mining and Smelting Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as \"Brunswick\") were purchased by the appellant directly from Brunswick, being a part of an initial issue of shares by Brunswick to finance additional drilling and exploration work and for some underground development.\nThe nature of Brunswick's enterprise is described by Cameron J. as follows:\nThe Brunswick assets, according to the evidence, consisted of a number of mining claims in New Brunswick. The area had been previously explored and found to be unprofitable. But in 1952, when iron ore was scarce, geologists went into the area and found indications of certain minerals. Geophysical surveys followed and they indicated the possibility of very substantial deposits of lead, tin, sulphur and zinc. The company then decided to issue 500,000 shares of stock at $10 per share to raise funds for its exploitation, development, and the construction of a mill.\nThe other matter is that the purchase and sale of the Brunswick shares was not authorized by the Memorandum of Association of the appellant, or by the statutory powers conferred upon it by s. 19 of The Companies Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 53. There can, therefore, be no suggestion that in purchasing and selling the shares in question the appellant was engaged in a business which it had been created to carry on. The purchase and sale of the shares was outside the scope of its business activities and consequently nothing can turn on the fact that the appellant is a limited company as contrasted with an individual.\nThe relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, as amended, are the following:\n3. The income of a taxpayer for a taxation year for the purposes of this Part is his income for the year from all sources inside or outside Canada and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, includes income for the year from all\n(a) businesses,\n(b) property, and\n(c) offices and employments.\n4. Subject to the other provisions of this Part, income for a taxation year from a business or property is the profit therefrom for the year.\n* * *\n139. (1) In this Act,\n* * *\n(e) \"business\" includes a profession, calling, trade, manufacture or undertaking of any kind whatsoever and includes an adventure or concern in the nature of trade but does not include an office or employment;\nThe issue in this appeal is as to whether an isolated purchase of shares from the treasury of a corporation and subsequent sale thereof at a profit, not being a part of the business carried on by the purchaser of the shares, or in any way related to it, constitutes an adventure in the nature of trade so as to render such profit liable to income tax.\nThe only evidence given in the Court below was that submitted by the appellant. There are no findings as to credibility. The decision is based upon that evidence and upon inferences drawn therefrom.\nCameron J. held that there was an adventure in the nature of trade and the basis of his decision is stated as follows:\nOn the facts in evidence and drawing what I consider to be the proper inferences therefrom, I have reached the conclusion that the purchase in question was not an investment, but a purely speculative purchase, and was entered into with the intention of disposing of the stock at a profit as soon as there was a reasonable opportunity of so doing. It was therefore an adventure or concern in the nature of trade. The reasons leading to his conclusion that the purchase was not an investment are:\n1. The fact that the appellant borrowed the funds necessary to effect the purchase of the shares;\n2. The inference that the nature of Brunswick indicated that its shares were speculative in value and that dividends could not be expected for some years.\nWith respect, I would not think that the question of whether securities are purchased with the purchaser's own funds, or with money borrowed by him, is a significant factor in determining whether their purchase and subsequent sale is or is not an investment.\nSimilarly, the fact that there was no immediate likelihood of dividends being paid on the shares should not have much significance, for there are many corporate ventures, financed by the sale of shares to the public, in which immediate payment of dividends may not be anticipated, and yet the purchase of the treasury shares of a company embarking on a new enterprise is a well-recognized method of making an investment.\nHowever, assuming that the conclusion was correct that this purchase was speculative in that it was made, not with the intention of holding the securities indefinitely, with a view to dividends, but made with the intention of disposing of the shares at a profit as soon as reasonably possible, does this, in itself, lead to the conclusion that it was an adventure in the nature of trade?\nIt is difficult to conceive of any case, in which securities are purchased, in which the purchaser does not have at least some intention of disposing of them if their value appreciates to the point where their sale appears to be financially desirable. If this is so, then any purchase and sale of securities must constitute an adventure in the nature of trade, unless it is attempted to ascertain whether the primary intention at the time of purchase is to retain the security or to sell it. This, however, leads to the difficulty mentioned by my brother Cartwright that the question of taxability is to be determined by seeking to ascertain the primary subjective intention of the purchaser at the time of purchase. I cannot agree that the question as to whether or not an isolated transaction in securities is to constitute an adventure in the nature of trade can be determined solely upon that basis. In my opinion, a person who puts money into a business enterprise by the purchase of the shares of a company on an isolated occasion, and not as a part of his regular business, cannot be said to have engaged in an adventure in the nature of trade merely because the purchase was speculative in that, at that time, he did not intend to hold the shares indefinitely, but intended, if possible, to sell them at a profit as soon as he reasonably could. I think that there must be clearer indications of \"trade\" than this before it can be said that there has been an adventure in the nature of trade. As Scott L.J. said, when delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Barry v. Cordy3:\nThat a single transaction may fall within Case 1 is clear; but, to bring it within, the transaction must bear clear indicia of \"trade\"; e.g., Martin v. Lowry, (1925) 11 Tax Cas. 297\u2014the single purchase of a vast quantity of linen for re-sale; or Rutledge v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue, (1929) 14 Tax Cas. 495, where there was a single purchase of paper. Unless ex facie the single transaction is obviously commercial, the profit from it is more likely to be an accretion of capital and not a yield of income.\nThe history of the phrase \"adventure or concern in the nature of trade\" was considered by the learned President of the Exchequer Court in Minister of National Revenue v. Taylor4, where he said:\nThe expression \"advanture or concern in the nature of trade\" appeared for the first time in a Canadian income tax act in Section 127(1)(e) of the 1948 Act. It was, no doubt, taken from the Income Tax Act, 1918 of the United Kingdom. In that Act under Case I of Schedule D tax was chargeable in respect of any trade \u2026 and Section 237 defined trade as including \"every trade, manufacture, adventure or concern in the nature of trade\". Prior to its inclusion in the definition of trade by Section 237 of the Income Tax Act 1918, the expression appeared in the Income Tax Act of 1842. In that Act provision was made in the First Case under Schedule D for the charging of duties in respect of any \"Trade, Manufacture, Adventure, or Concern in the nature of Trade,\u2026.\" Indeed, the expression goes back to the Act of 1803.\nIn that case Thorson P. reviewed a number of the leading English and Scottish cases which had dealt with the meaning of the expression and, from those decisions, he formulated certain general propositions, some negative and some positive, applicable in determining whether or not a particular transaction did or did not constitute an adventure in the nature of trade. These are set out in the judgment of my brother Cartwright.\nThe positive tests to which he refers as being derived from the decided cases as indicative of an adventure in the nature of trade are: (1) Whether the person dealt with the property purchased by him in the same way as a dealer would ordinarily do and (2) whether the nature and quantity of the subject-matter of the transaction may exclude the possibility that its sale was the realization of an investment, or otherwise of a capital nature, or that it could have been disposed of otherwise than as a trade transaction.\nI will deal first with the second of these tests, which, if applied to the circumstances of the present case, would not, in my opinion, indicate that there had been an adventure in the nature of trade.\nThe nature of the property in question here is shares issued from the treasury of a corporation and we have not been referred to any reported case in which profit from one isolated purchase and sale of shares, by a person not engaged in the business of trading in securities, has been claimed to be taxable.\nCases in which the nature and quantity of the property purchased and sold have indicated an adventure in the nature of trade include The Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Livingston5 (el cargo vessel); Rutledge v. The Commissioners of Inland Revenue6, (a large quantity of toilet paper); Lindsay v. The Commissioners of Inland Revenue7, and Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Fraser8, (a large quantity of whisky); Edwards v. Bairstow9, (a complete spinning plant) and Regal Heights Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue10, (40 acres of vacant city land).\nCorporate shares are in a different position because they constitute something the purchase of which is, in itself, an investment. They are not, in themselves, articles of commerce, but represent an interest in a corporation which is itself created for the purpose of doing business. Their acquisition is a well-recognized method of investing capital in a business enterprise. This point is made by Lord Normand in Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Fraser, supra, at p. 502:\nThere was much discussion as to the criterion which the Court should apply. I doubt if it would be possible to formulate a single criterion. I said in a case which we decided only yesterday that one important factor may be the person who enters into the transaction \u2026 It is in general more easy to hold that a single transaction, entered into by an individual in the line of his own trade (although not part and parcel of his ordinary business) is an adventure in the nature of trade than to hold that a transaction entered into by an individual outside the line of his own trade or occupation is an adventure in the nature of trade. But what is a good deal more important is the nature of the transaction with reference to the commodity dealt in. The individual who enters into a purchase of an article or commodity may have in view the resale of it at a profit, and yet it may be that that is not the only purpose for which he purchased the article or the commodity, nor the only purpose to which he might turn it if favourable opportunity of sale does not occur. In some cases the purchase of a picture has been given as an illustration. An amateur may purchase a picture with a view to its resale at a profit, and yet he may recognize at the time or afterwards that the possession of the picture will give him aesthetic enjoyment if he is unable ultimately, or at his chosen time, to realise it at a profit. A man may purchase stocks and shares with a view to selling them at an early date at a profit, but, if he does so, he is purchasing something which is itself an investment, a potential source of revenue to him while he holds it.\nSimilarly, Viscount Simonds, in his judgment in Edwards v. Bairstow11, when considering the suggested characteristics of an adventure in the nature of trade, said:\nI find \"activities which led to the maturing of the asset to be sold\" and the search for opportunities for its sale, and, conspicuously, I find that the nature of the asset lent itself to commercial transactions. And by that I mean, what I think Rowlatt J. meant in Leeming v. Jones, [1930] 1 K.B. 279, that a complete spinning plant is an asset which, unlike stocks or shares, by itself produces no income and, unlike a picture, does not serve to adorn the drawing room of its owner. It is a commercial asset and nothing else.\nFurthermore, the quantity of shares purchased by the appellant in the present case would not, in my opinion, be indicative of an adventure in the nature of trade, as it constituted only 4,000 out of a total issue of 500,000 shares.\nThe first of the two tests mentioned was stated by Lord Clyde in The Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Livingston, supra, and is commented upon by Rowlatt J. in Leeming v. Jones12:\nI venture to refer, with respect, to what the Lord President, Lord Clyde, said in Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Livingston, 11 Tax Cas. 538 at 542. He is dealing with this very point, and he says: \"I think the test, which must be used to determine whether a venture such as we are now considering is, or is not, 'in the nature of trade,' is whether the operations involved in it are of the same kind, and carried on in the same way, as those which are characteristic of ordinary trading in the line of business in which the venture was made.\" That covers all the cases. In the Cape Brandy Syndicate case, [1921] 2 K.B. 403, what the appellants had was in the ordinary line of business as brandy importers, and so on; what they had in Martin v. Lowry, [1927] A.C. 312, was what is done in the ordinary case of merchants buying a thing, advertising it and so on; and what was done in Livingston's case, 11 Tax Cas. 542, was in the ordinary course of the business of ship dealers and repairers, and so on.\nWere the operations involved in the present case of the same kind and carried on in the same way as those which are characteristic of ordinary trading in the line of business in which the venture was made?\nThe only operations of the appellant in the present case were the purchase of 4,000 treasury shares directly from Brunswick and their subsequent sale, presumably through brokers. This is not the sort of trading which would be carried on ordinarily by those engaged in the business of trading in securities. The appellant's purchase was not an underwriting, nor was it a participation in an underwriting syndicate with respect to an issue of securities for the purpose of effecting their sale to the public, and did not have the characteristics of that kind of a venture. What the appellant did was to acquire a capital interest in a new corporate business venture, in a manner which has the characteristics of the making of an investment, and subsequently to dispose, by sale, of that interest.\nBut it may be contended that persons may make a business merely of the buying and selling of securities, without being traders in securities in the ordinary sense, and that the transactions involved in that kind of business are similar, except in number, to that which occurred here. It has, however, been pointed out in the well-known case of Californian Copper Syndicate v. Harris13, that, where the realization of securities is involved, the taxability of enhanced values depends on whether such realization was an act done in the carrying on of a business. In that case the Commissioners had held that the transaction there in question was an adventure or concern in the nature of trade. The judgments on appeal make no reference to that point, but are based on the ground that the turning of the investment to account in that case was not merely incidental, but was the essential feature of the appellant's business. The passage in question reads as follows:\nIt is quite a well settled principle in dealing with questions of assessment of Income Tax, that where the owner of an ordinary investment chooses to realise it, and obtains a greater price for it than he originally acquired it at, the enhanced price is not profit in the sense of Schedule D of the Income Tax Act of 1842 assessable to Income Tax. But it is equally well established that enhanced value's obtained from realisation or conversion of securities may be so assessable, where what is done is not merely a realisation or change of investment, but an act done in what is truly the carrying on, or carrying out, of a business. The simplest case is that of a person or association of persons buying and selling lands or securities speculatively, in order to make gain, dealing in such investments as a business, and thereby seeking to make profits. There are many companies which in their very inception are formed for such a purpose, and in these cases it is not doubtful that, where they make a gain by a realisation, the gain they make is liable to be assessed for Income Tax.\nIn my opinion, the transaction in question here does not fall within either of the positive tests which the authorities have suggested should be applied.\nThe only test which was applied in the present case was whether the appellant entered into the transaction with the intention of disposing of the shares at a profit so soon as there was a reasonable opportunity of so doing. Is that a sufficient test for determining whether or not this transaction constitutes an adventure in the nature of trade? I do not think that, standing alone, it is sufficient. I agree with the views expressed on this very point by Rowlatt J. in Leeming v. Jones, supra, at p. 284. That case involved the question of the taxability of profits derived from purchase and sale of two rubber estates in the Malay Peninsula. The Commissioners initially found that there was a concern in the nature of trade because the property in question was acquired with the sole object of disposing of it at a profit. Rowlatt J. sent the case back to the Commissioners and states his reasons as follows:\nI think it is quite clear that what the Commissioners have to find is whether there is here a concern in the nature of trade. Now, what they have found they say in these words (I am reading it in short): That the property was acquired with the sole object of turning it over again at a profit, and without any intention of holding the property as an investment. That describes what a man does if he buys a picture that he sees going cheap at Christie's, because he knows that in a month he will sell it again at Christie's. That is not carrying on a trade. Those words will not do as a finding of carrying on a trade or anything else. What the Commissioners must do is to say, one way or the other, was this\u2014I will not say carrying on a trade, but was it a speculation or a venture in the nature of trade? I do not indicate which way it ought to be, but I commend the Commissioners to consider what took place in the nature of organizing the speculation, maturing the property, and disposing of the property, and when they have considered all that, to say whether they think it was an adventure in the nature of trade or not.\nThe case was returned to the Commissioners, who then found as a fact that there had not been a concern in the nature of trade. Ultimately it reached the House of Lords14, where the main issue was as to whether the profits were taxable under Case VI of Schedule D of the Income Tax Act, 1918. There is, however, a general statement of principle by Lord Buckmaster, at p. 420, which aptly applies to the present case, when he says:\nan accretion to capital does not become income merely because the original capital was invested in the hope and expectation that it would rise in value; if it does so rise, its realization does not make it income.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be allowed, with costs here and in the Court below, and the matter should be referred to the respondent with the direction that he deduct from the income of the appellant, for the taxation year 1953, the sum of $26,897.50.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nCartwright J. (dissenting):\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Cameron J.15 dismissing an appeal from a decision of the Tax Appeal Board whereby the reassessment of the appellant for the taxation year ending December 31, 1953, was affirmed.\nThe relevant facts are fully set out in the reasons of Cameron J. and a brief summary will be sufficient to make plain the question which arises for decision.\nThe appellant was incorporated on October 25, 1947, under the Companies Act of the Province of Alberta as a limited company. The original purpose of its promoters was to erect a mill for the dehydration of alfalfa, but this was abandoned by August 1948. The appellant remained inactive until the autumn of 1952 when it purchased an office building in Calgary; it spent a substantial amount on alterations and, towards the end of 1955, sold the building for a sum equal to the total amount which it had spent on it. Early in 1953 the directors of the appellant received a favourable report on the shares of the Brunswick Mining and Smelting Corporation Limited, herinafter referred to as \"Brunswick\", and on or about February 23, 1953, the appellant purchased 4,000 treasury shares of that company at $10 per share, the total purchase price being $40,000. Between March 10 and March 13, 1953, the appellant sold 2,400 of these shares for a total of $38,513.50 and in June 1953, it sold the remaining 1,600 shares for a sum in excess of $28,000. It is common ground that the appellant realized a total profit of $26,897.50 from the purchase and sale of these 4,000 shares.\nWith the exception of certain debentures purchased in 1955 after the sale of the building referred to above the appellant had no dealings in securities other than the purchase and sale of the 4,000 shares of Brunswick.\nThere is no dispute as to any of the facts set out above.\nAt the trial before Cameron J. the only witness examined was Mr. Cheshire, the president of the appellant. The effect of his evidence was that the appellant purchased the Brunswick shares because it \"felt that this was an excellent opportunity to invest money in a company which appeared to have an excellent chance for growth and development into a large mining operation\", that the sales in March were prompted by the fact that the bank was pressing the appellant for repayment of a loan and those in June by the decision reached by the directors of the appellant at an informal meeting that the price of the shares had risen to such a point that, having regard to the aggregate value of Brunswick's known assets, it ceased to be in accordance with sound judgment to continue to hold them as an investment. There is, I think, an implication in the evidence of this witness that the shares were purchased as a long term investment rather than as a speculation looking to a quick turnover but there is no express statement to that effect.\nCameron J. made the following finding of fact:\nOn the facts: in evidence and drawing what I consider to be the proper inferences therefrom, I have reached the conclusion that the purchase in question was not an investment, but a purely speculative purchase, and was entered into with the intention of disposing of the stock at a profit as soon as there was a reasonable opportunity of so doing. The considerations which brought Cameron J. to this conclusion were, (i) that the appellant at the time of purchasing the Brunswick shares had no funds of its own available for investment and used borrowed funds to pay for them, (ii) that the nature of the Brunswick undertaking was such that its shares were of speculative value, (iii) that even if Brunswick's operations proved successful its shares could not be expected to yield any dividends for a considerable time, and (iv) that the shares were held by the appellant only for the short time mentioned above.\nAfter considering the whole record, in the light of the full and able argument of counsel, I find myself unable to say that the finding of fact made by Cameron J. was not justified by the evidence, and in my opinion it should not be disturbed.\nThere are difficulties in ascertaining the intention of a corporation in entering into a transaction. In Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Fisher's Executors16, Lord Sumner said:\nIn any case desires and intentions are things of which a company is incapable. These are the mental operations of its shareholders and officers. The only intention that the company has is such as is expressed in or necessarily follows from its proceedings. It is hardly a paradox to say that the form of a company's resolutions and instruments is their substance.\nOn the other hand in Regal Heights Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue17, Judson J., who gave the judgment of the majority of the Court held that the intentions of the appellant company were throughout its existence identical with those of its promoters who later became its directors.\nIn the case at bar there is no record of any resolution of the board of directors of the appellant or indeed of any formal proceeding to assist the Court in ascertaining its intention. The decisions in relation to the sale of the Brunswick shares appear to have been made at \"informal meetings\" of the directors. Mr. Cheshire's evidence regarding the appellant's intention was, as has been pointed out above, somewhat indefinite and it was proper for the learned trial judge to draw an inference as to what that intention was from the surrounding circumstances. Having concluded that we should accept the finding of fact made by Cameron J. and quoted above, the point which arises for decision may be briefly stated as follows. The appellant, which was not at any time engaged in the business of trading in securities, made an isolated speculative purchase of a block of shares, not with the intention of retaining them as an investment which would sooner or later yield an income by way of dividends but in the expectation and with the intention of disposing of the shares in the near future at an increased price; this expectation was realized as to part of the shares in less than a month and as to the balance within four months. The question is whether the resulting profit constitutes taxable income or a non-taxable capital gain.\nThe applicable sections of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, as amended, are sections 3, 4 and 139(1)(e) which read as follows:\n3. The income of a taxpayer for a taxation year for the purposes of this Part is his income for the year from all sources inside or outside Canada and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, includes income for the year from all\n(a) businesses,\n(b) property, and\n(c) offices and employments.\n4. Subject to the other provisions of this Part, income for a taxation year from a business or property is the profit therefrom for the year.\n139(1) In this Act,\n(e) \"business\" includes a profession, calling, trade, manufacture or undertaking of any kind whatsoever and includes an adventure or concern in the nature of trade but does not include an office or employment.\nCameron J. was of opinion that the purchase and sale of the Brunswick shares was an adventure or concern in the nature of trade. The respondent supports this view while the appellant contends that, what occurred was simply the realization at an enhanced price of a capital asset or investment and did not constitute an adventure or concern in the nature of trade.\nIn Minister of National Revenue v. Taylor18, the learned President of the Exchequer Court points out that while the phrase \"adventure or concern in the nature of trade\" first appeared in a Canadian Income Tax Act in s. 127(1)(e) of the 1948 Act it has been found in the Income Tax Acts of the United Kingdom since the Act of 1842 and indeed goes back to the Act of 1803. He then proceeds to a careful examination of the leading cases dealing with the meaning of the phrase decided up to the time of his decision and arrives inductively at certain general propositions to guide the Court in dealing wtih a particular case; these are accurately summarized in the head-note to the report as follows:\nOn the negative side:\n(i) The singleness or isolation of a transaction cannot be a test of whether it was an adventure in the nature of trade\u2014it is the nature of the transaction, not its singleness or isolation that is to be determined.\n(ii) It is not essential to a transaction being an adventure in the nature of trade that an organization be set up to carry it into effect.\n(iii) The fact that a transaction is totally different in nature from any of the other activities of the taxpayer and that he has never entered upon a transaction of that kind before or since does not, of itself, take it out of the category of being an adventure in the nature of trade.\n(iv) The intention to sell the purchased property at a profit is not of itself a test of whether the profit is subject to tax for the intention to make a profit may be just as much the purpose of an investment transaction as of a trading one. The considerations prompting the transaction may be of such a business nature as to invest it with the character of an adventure in the nature of trade even without any intention of making a profit on the sale of the purchased commodity.\nOn the positive side:\n(i) If a person deals with the commodity purchased by him in the same way as a dealer in it would ordinarily do such a dealing is a trading adventure.\n(ii) The nature and quantity of the subject matter of the transaction may exclude the possibility that its sale was the realization of an investment or otherwise of a capital nature or that it could have been disposed of otherwise than as a trade transaction.\nThe learned President while formulating these guides as helpful recognizes (vide p. 214 of the report) \"that the question whether a particular transaction is an adventure in the nature of trade depends on its character and surrounding circumstances and no single criterion can be formulated.\"\nIn McIntosh v. Minister of National Revenue19, Kerwin C.J., delivering the judgment of the Court said at p. 121:\nIt is impossible to lay down a test that will meet the multifarious circumstances that may arise in all fields of human endeavour it is a question of fact in each case. In the case at bar it appears to me that on the view which he took of the facts Cameron J. was right in holding that the transaction in question was an adventure in the nature of trade and that consequently the profit arising from it was taxable.\nAmong the meanings of the word \"adventure\" given in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary are \"a pecuniary venture\" and \"a speculation\"; \"venture\" in turn is given the meaning, \"a commercial enterprize in which there is considerable risk of loss as well as chance of gain\". That the transaction was an adventure does not seem to me to admit of doubt.\nEqually, I think, it was \"in the nature of trade\". In Edwards v. Bairstow20, Lord Radcliffe said at p. 38:\nDealing is, I think, essentially a trading adventure, and the respondents' operations were nothing but a deal or deals in plant and machinery.\nIn the case at bar the appellant's transaction was a deal in mining shares.\nThere is nothing in the reasons of Cameron J. or in what I have said above to throw the slightest doubt on the applicability to the Income Tax Act in this country of the principle stated by the Lord Justice Clerk, in Californian Copper Syndicate v. Harris21:\nIt is quite a well settled principle in dealing with questions of assessment of Income Tax, that where the owner of an ordinary investment chooses to realize it, and obtains a greater price for it than he originally acquired it at, the enhanced price is not profit in the sense of Schedule D of the Income Tax Act of 1842 assessable to Income Tax.\nOn the facts as found by Cameron J. in the case at bar, the profit realized was not the enhancement in price of an ordinary investment but rather \"a gain made in an operation of business in carrying out a scheme for profit-making\". To hold otherwise would appear to me to be contrary to the reasoning of the majority in the Regal Heights case, supra.\nI have arrived at this conclusion with some hesitation. It appears to me to involve the result that in cases of this nature the answer to the question whether a profit is or is not taxable depends on the purely subjective test as to the intention of the taxpayer when he acquired the shares which have subsequently been sold at a profit. If, for example, in the case at bar it had been found as a fact that the intention of the appellant when it acquired the shares was to hold them as an investment looking forward to the time when Brunswick would pay dividends the circumstance that a few weeks later it sold the shares at a profit would not have rendered that profit subject to tax. In Bawlf Grain Co. v. Ross22, Duff J., as he then was, pointed out that the law does not as a rule \"take note of subjective events in the stream of consciousness save in relation to or as manifested by some external word or deed.\" It seems strange that the question whether a certain profit is subject to tax should depend on the intention with which the taxpayer entered into the transaction from which it resulted, but the words of Bowen L.J. in Edgington v. Fitzmaurice23, have often been quoted with approval:\n\u2026 the state of a man's mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion. It is true that it is very difficult to prove what the state of a man's mind at a particular time is, but if it can be ascertained it is as much a fact as anything else.\nThe other cause of my hesitation is that while the expression \"adventure or concern in the nature of trade\" has been in the acts in the United Kingdom for a century and a half and in the act in this country for thirteen years counsel have not referred to any reported case in which the profit arising from one isolated purchase and sale of shares by a taxpayer not engaged in the business of trading in securities has been claimed to be taxable. However this is perhaps not the type of problem in the solution of which the maxim omnis innovatio plus novitate perturbat quam utilitate prodest is of assistance.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs, Cartwright and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McLaws, McLaws, Bancroft, Deyell & Floyd, Calgary.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Department of National Revenue, Ottawa.\n1 [1960] C.T.C. 329, 60 D.T.C. 1232.\n2 [1960] C.T.C. 329, 60 D.T.C. 1232.\n3 [1946] 2 AU E.R. 396 at p. 400.\n4 [1956] C.T.C. 189 at p. 198, 56 D.T.C. 1125.\n5 (1926), 11 Tax Cas. 538.\n6 (1929), 14 Tax Cas. 490.\n7 (1932), 18 Tax Cas. 43.\n8 (1942), 24 Tax Cas. 498.\n9 [1956] A.C. 14.\n10 [1960] S.C.R. 902.\n11 [1956] A.C. 14 at p. 29.\n12 [1930] 1 K.B. 279 at p. 283.\n13 (1904), 5 Tax Cas. 159 at p. 165.\n14 [1930] A.C. 415.\n15 [1960] C.T.C. 329, 60 D.T.C. 1232.\n16 [1926] A.C. 395, 42 T.L.R. 340.\n17 [1960] S.C.R. 902, 26 D.L.R.

Ltd., a company carrying on a department store business, A owned 72 and the appellants, his son and daughter, owned the rest. A was intending to remarry and in view of that expected event entered into a written agreement on June 1, 1956, whereby he transferred his 72 shares of A. Ltd., together with three lots and the building where the company operated its business, to E. Ltd., a corporation of which the appellants were the only beneficial shareholders. The consideration for the transfer of this property, which had a fair market value of $344,400, was an annuity having a value of $148,000, payable to A. The latter died on June 20, 1956.\nThe Minister assessed succession duty on the whole of the $344,400, as a gift under s. 3(1) (d) of the Dominion Succession Duty Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 89 . The appellants, administrators of A's estate, conceded that the difference between $344,400 and $148,000 was subject to duty, but contended that only that difference was subject to duty under s. 3(1)(k) of the Act. In the Exchequer Court it was held that the transaction in question was a \"gift\" with a benefit to the donor provided \"by contract\", within the meaning of s. 3(1) (d), and that the property was not \"transferred for partial consideration\", within the meaning of s. 3(1) (k), because the obtaining of the consideration was not, in the view of the trial judge, the real object of the transaction. The administrators of the estate appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe transaction fell squarely within the provisions of s. 3(1) (k) of the Dominion Succession Duty Act . It involved a transfer of property for a partial consideration agreed to be paid.\nIf para. (k) is to have any effect at all, it must apply to transactions in which, while there is an element of bounty involved, there is also a partial consideration paid or agreed to be paid for a transfer of property. That was clearly the intention in the circumstances of the present case. There was certainly an element of bounty involved, but, notwithstanding that fact, there was an agreement to pay a partial consideration for the transfer of property. It, therefore, fell within para, (k) and, that being so, it did not constitute a gift within the meaning of s. 3(1) (d) of the Act.\nAttorney General v. Worrall, [1895] 1 Q.B. 99; Attorney-General v. John- son, [1903] 1 K.B. 617, distinguished; In re Baroness Bateman, [1925] 2 K.B. 429; Attorney-General for Ontario v.

Btikeman, Q.C., and P. N. Thorsteinsson, for the appellants.\nD. S. Maxwell, Q.C., and G. W. Ainslie, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014On June 1, 1956, Nathan Adilman, of Saskatoon, then 67 years of age, entered into a written agreement with Edison Wholesale Ltd., a Saskatchewan corporation (hereinafter referred to as \"Edison\"), whereby he transferred to Edison 72 common shares in the capital stock of a company known as Adilman's Limited and three lots, and the building situated thereon, in the City of Saskatoon. The consideration for the transfer was his receiving from Edison a monthly sum of $1,666.66, during his lifetime, payable on the first of each month, commencing July 1, 1956. It was agreed that, in any event, the payments should cease after a total of $200,000 had been received.\nAdilman's Limited carried on a department store business in the building in question prior to the transfer. Out of its 160 issued shares, Nathan Adilman owned 72 and the appellants, his son and daughter, owned the rest. The appellants were the only beneficial shareholders of Edison.\nIt was agreed, in an agreed statement of facts, that \"the said agreement was entered into by the deceased and Edison Wholesale Ltd. in good faith, for legitimate family reasons and in view of the intended remarriage of the deceased, and not in an attempt to avoid the payment of any Succession Duty.\"\nNathan Adilman died on June 20, 1956. The fair market value of the shares and the land mentioned in the agreement, as of the date of his death, was $344,400. The annual value of that property, as in June 1956, was $28,000. The present value of the annuity payable pursuant to the agreement, as of its date, was $148,000.\nThe respondent seeks to charge succession duty on the whole of the $344,400, as a gift under s. 3(1) (d) of the Dominion Succession Duty Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 89 . The appellants, who are the administrators of Nathan Adilman's estate, concede that the difference between $344,400 and $148,000 is subject to duty, but contend that only that difference is subject to duty under s. 3(1) (k) of the Act.\nThe learned trial judge2 reached the conclusion that the transaction in question was a \"gift\" with a benefit to the donor provided \"by contract\", within the meaning of s. 3(1) (d) of the Dominion Succession Duty Act , and that the property was not \"transferred for partial consideration\", within the meaning of s. 3(1) (k) of the Act, because the obtaining of the consideration was not, in his view, the real object of the transaction.\nThe relevant provisions of the Act are as follows:\n3. (1) A \"succession\" shall be deemed to include the following dispositions of property and the beneficiary and the deceased shall be deemed to be the \"successor\" and \"predecessor\" respectively in relation to such property:\n(d) property taken under a gift whenever made of which actual and bona fide possession and enjoyment has not been assumed by the donee or by a trustee for the donee at least three years before the death of the deceased and thenceforward retained to the entire exclusion of the donor or of any benefit to him, whether voluntary or by contract or otherwise;\n(k) property transferred within three years prior to the death of the deceased for partial consideration in money or money's worth paid or agreed to be paid to the deceased, to the extent to which the value of the property when transferred exceeds the value of the consideration so paid or agreed to be paid;\nThe words \"agreed to be paid\", where they appear in para. (k), were added to that paragraph by an amendment to the Act in 1952.\nThe learned trial judge reached his conclusion that the transaction fell within s. 3(1) (d) on the basis that, in sub- stance, the agreement between Nathan Adilman and Edison was entered into for the purpose of conferring a benefit on the appellants and not for the purpose of acquiring the annuity; that the transaction was not dictated by commercial considerations and that, accordingly, on the authority of certain English decisions, it was a gift within the meaning of s. 3(1) (d).\nThe relevant English legislation, to which reference is made in those cases, was contained in the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1881, 44 & 45 Vict., c. 12, as amended, and in the Finance Act, 1894, 57 & 58 Vict., c. 30.\nSection 38 of the first-mentioned statute provided, in part, as follows:\n38. (1) Stamp duties at the like rates as are by this Act charged on affidavits and inventories shall be charged and paid on accounts delivered of the personal or moveable property to be included therein according to the value thereof.\n(2) The personal or moveable property to be included in an account shall be property of the following descriptions, viz.:\u2014\n(a) Any property taken as a donatio mortis causa made by any person dying on or after the first day of June one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, or taken under a voluntary disposition, made by any person so dying, purporting to operate as an immediate gift inter vivos whether by way of transfer, delivery, declaration of trust or otherwise, which shall not have been bona fide made three months before the death of the deceased.\nThis provision was amended in 1889, by c. 7, 52 & 53 Vict., by s. 11 thereof, which provided:\n11. (1) Sub-section two of section thirty-eight of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1881, is hereby amended as follows:\u2014\nThe description of property marked (a) shall be read as if the word \"twelve\" were substituted for the word \"three\" therein, and the said description of property shall include property taken under any gift, whenever made, of which property bona fide possession and enjoyment shall not have been assumed by the donee immediately upon the gift and thenceforward retained, to the entire exclusion of the donor, or of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise:\n* * *\nThe Finance Act, 1894 provided for the imposition of estate duty, which, in respect of property falling within its terms, replaced the duties payable under the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1881. Section 2(1)(c) of the Finance Act, 1894 provided:\n2. (1) Property passing on the death of the deceased shall be deemed to include the property following, that is to say:\u2014\n* * *\n(c) Property which would be required on the death of the deceased to be included in an account under section thirty-eight of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1881, as amended by section eleven of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1889, if those sections were herein enacted and extended to real property as well as personal property, and the words \"voluntary\" and \"voluntarily\" and a reference to a \"volunteer\" were omitted therefrom;\nIn addition, s. 3 of this Act provided for an exception, regarding the payment of estate duty, in the following terms:\n3. (1) Estate duty shall not be payable in respect of property passing on the death of the deceased by reason only of a bona fide purchase from the person under whose disposition the property passes, nor in respect of the falling into possession of the reversion on any lease for lives, nor in respect of the determination of any annuity for lives, where such purchase was made, or such lease or annuity granted, for full consideration in money or money's worth paid to the vendor or grantor for his own use or benefit, or in the case of a lease for the use or benefit of any person for whom the grantor was a trustee.\n(2) Where any such purchase was made, or lease or annuity granted, for partial consideration in money or money's worth paid to the vendor or grantor for his own use or benefit, or in the case of a lease for the use or benefit of any person for whom the grantor was a trustee, the value of the consideration shall be allowed as a deduction from the value of the property for the purpose of Estate duty.\nAttorney General v. Worrall3, one of the cases mentioned by the learned trial judge, arose prior to the enactment of the Finance Act, 1894. In that case, Lopes L.J., at p. 105, said:\nOne question is whether in this case there was a \"gift\" of property at all. It is suggested that there was not, because there was a collateral covenant by the son to pay to the father an annuity. It appears to me that there was not the less a gift within the meaning of the Act on that account.\nA. L. Smith L.J., at p. 107, said:\nThe next point is this. It is said that the transaction is not a gift within the meaning of the statute because a consideration was given. On reading s. 11, sub-s. 1, it seems clear that the legislature in using the word \"gift\" in that section contemplated cases where the donee enters into a covenant such as this.\nAttorney-General v. Johnson4, was concerned with the application of the Finance Act, 1894. In that case 500 pounds was paid to the directors of an unincorporated charitable society in lieu of a legacy, the trustees of the society to pay to the donor and to his wife, if she survived him, an annuity of 25 pounds. The Crown claimed that, on the donor's death, estate duty became payable by the society on the 500 pounds. Phillimore J., at the trial, held that the 500 pounds was, in the first instance, taxable, but further held that there should be deducted from that amount the value of the annuity of 25 pounds. This view was overruled by the Court of Appeal, which held that this was not a case of a bona fide purchase of an annuity at all and that it was a case of a testamentary gift effected by the machinery of a present donation subject to a reservation of something intended to be the equivalent of a life interest in the subject-matter of the donation.\nIt will be noted that the first of these cases, having arisen prior to the enactment of the Finance Act, 1894, was not concerned with the possible application of s. 3(2) of that Act. The second case did deal with that provision and, as pointed out, the Court of Appeal disagreed with Phillimore J., who would have applied it.\nSection 3 of the Finance Act, 1894 was not a definition of a certain kind of property which was deemed to pass on the death of the deceased. It created an exception to the obligation to pay estate duty, an exception which, in both its subsections, was limited to \"a bona fide purchase\". Consequently, in deciding whether or not s. 3(2) was applicable in Attorney-General v. Johnson, the issue before the Court was as to whether or not the transaction in question was a bona fide purchase. On the other hand, para. (k) of s. 3(1) of the Dominion Succession Duty Act does not define an exception to the obligation to pay duty. It defines a certain kind of transaction which shall be deemed to be a succession under the Act. I agree with the contention of the appellants that when that definition was included in s. 3(1) it must be assumed that it was placed there so as to include, as a succession, a certain type of transaction which would not otherwise have been included under any of the other paragraphs of that subsection.\nFurthermore, para. (k) is in terms substantially different from those of s. 3 of the Finance Act, 1894. Paragraph (k) does not refer to \"a bona fide purchase\". It refers to \"property transferred for partial consideration in money or money's worth paid or agreed to be paid\". I accept the view of Rowlatt J., in In re Baroness Bateman5, when, in interpreting the English provision, he construed the words \"partial consideration\" as meaning something less than the full and fair value of the property.\nIn my opinion, the transaction in question here fell squarely within the provisions of para. (k). It involved a transfer of property for a partial consideration agreed to be paid. With respect, I cannot agree with the view of the learned trial judge that, in applying this definition, it must be determined that the obtaining of the partial consideration was \"the real object of the transaction\". It seems to me that para. (k) defines a certain kind of situation which, on the facts of the present case, existed here.\nAs we are called on, in the present case, to deal with a provision which did not exist in the English statute, it is necessary to construe s. 3(1) (d) of the Dominion Succession Duty Act in the light of the existence, in the same subsection, of para. (k). The English cases cited do not assist us in this matter. Whatever the word \"gift\" might mean within s. 2(1)(c) of the Finance Act, 1894, standing by itself, it is necessary, in construing the present Act, to construe s. 3(1) (d) in the light of the existence of para. (k) and, in my view, a transaction which falls within para. (k) cannot be regarded as being a gift within the meaning of s.3(1) (d).\nMy view as to the proper method of construing these provisions of our own statute is, I think, reinforced by what was said by Lord Blanesburgh, in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Perry6, when he said, with respect to the construction of the Ontario Succession Duty Act:\nFirst then, is the Ontario sub-section, unlike the corresponding British enactment, an \"original\" section? In their Lordships' judgment it undoubtedly is, and must be so construed. It contains on its face no reference to any origin. It comes into Ontario legislation full grown and without ancestry. It would, in their Lordships' judgment, be contrary to all principle, for the purpose of construing it, to look at the evolution even of the same enactment under some other system of law.\nI do not agree, therefore; with the submission of the respondent that the question before us is as to whether or not the agreement in question can be fairly considered to have been merely a commercial agreement, or whether, looking at the substance of it and the circumstances in which it was entered into, one may regard it as a gift. In my opinion, if para. (k) is to have any effect at all, it must apply to transactions in which, while there is an element of bounty involved, there is also a partial consideration paid or agreed to be paid for a transfer of property. That was clearly the intention in the circumstances of the present case. There was certainly an element of bounty involved, but, notwithstanding that fact, there was an agreement to pay a partial consideration for the transfer of property. It, therefore, fell within para. (k) and, that being so, in my opinion it does not constitute a gift within the meaning of s. 3(1) (d) of the Dominion Succession Duty Act .\nIn my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be allowed, with costs throughout, on the basis that, pursuant to s. 3(1) (k) of the Dominion Succession Duty Act , only the difference between $148,000 and $344,400, i.e., $196,400, was dutiable as a succession to Edison Wholesale Ltd. from the estate of Nathan Adilman, deceased, and the matter should, therefore, be referred back to the respondent for reassessment accordingly.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Stikeman & Elliott, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

He testified he had noticed that a rifle in the porch was cocked and that on re-entering the cabin he had asked the woman if it was loaded and she answered it was not. He, nevertheless, proceeded to uncock the rifle and it discharged, the bullet killing the woman instantaneously. The accused's story indicated that when he attempted to uncock the rifle, the rifle barrel was directly in line with the head of the deceased then lying in bed. Thereafter, and on three successive occasions, the appellant admitted responsibility for the shooting, but at the trial his evidence, in substance, was that he had no intention of harming the deceased and the shooting was purely accidental.\nThe jury were particularly instructed as to murder; manslaughter; provocation, drunkenness and criminal negligence, as incidents reducing murder to manslaughter, and directed that if the shooting was accidental and unaccompanied by criminal negligence, there was no crime. At the close of the trial they brought in a verdict that \"we find death by accidental means with elements of criminal negligence, and bring in a verdict of manslaughter\". The appellant's conviction was affirmed by a majority of the Court of Appeal. He then appealed to this Court on the grounds, (i) that the trial judge misdirected the jury, and (ii) that the verdict of the jury was ambiguous and the trial judge should not have directed a verdict of guilty of manslaughter to be entered.\nHeld (Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed on the charge of manslaughter.\nPer Locke, Cartwright and Martland JJ.: Assuming that Rozon v. The King, [1951] S.C.R. 248, is authority for the proposition that a person who is convicted of an indictable offence whose conviction is affirmed by the Court of Appeal and Who asserts a right of appeal to this Court under the provisions of s. 597(1) (a) of the Criminal Code must show not only (i) that a judge of the Court of Appeal dissented and (ii)' that his dissenting judgment was founded on a question of law, but also (iii) that the question of law upon which the dissenting judge founded his judgment was considered by the majority in the Court of Appeal and that they disagreed with the view of the dissenting judge upon it, this Court had jurisdiction to entertain the present appeal on both of the grounds put forward.\nWith respect to the first ground, the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal found that a passage in the charge to the jury was material and fatally misleading, while Johnson and Kane JJ.A. held that the same passage was irrelevant. This was a disagreement on a point of law.\nAs to the second ground, there was direct disagreement between the majority and the minority in the Court of Appeal and the question was one of law. In deciding what verdict should be entered by the Court following the rendering of a special verdict by the jury the judge was deciding a question of law.\nAs to the merits of the appeal, there was, as found by the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal, misdirection in the charge to the jury. Also as found by the Chief Justice, there was ambiguity or uncertainty in the jury's verdict.\nThe argument of counsel for the respondent, based on s. 592(1)(b) (iii) of the Code, was rejected.\nPer Taschereau J., dissenting: There was no dissent within the meaning of s. 597(1)(a) of the Code; there was no conflict between the majority judgment and the one delivered by the minority on questions of law. In order to give jurisdiction to this Court there must necessarily exist a difference between the views of the majority and those of the minority. None could be found in the present case. The King v. D\u00e9cary, [1942] S.C.R. 80; Rozon v. The King, supra; The Queen v. Fitton, [1956] S.C.R. 958, referred to.\nPer Fauteux J., dissenting: All the members of the Court of Appeal agreed that there was evidence to support a verdict of manslaughter founded on criminal negligence; there was no dissent expressed by the majority on the views taken by the minority on the question of the validity of the instructions in the charge to the jury; the only point of difference was confined to the verdict held to be ambiguous by the minority and unambiguous by the majority. The determination of the question whether the answer or opinion given by the jury on the facts was clear or ambiguous did not involve the determination of any question of law, nor was there any determined by either the members of the majority or those of the minority. The difference in the view they formed in the matter was not a difference on a question of law within the meaning of s. 597(1)(a).\nHowever, contrary to these views, assuming the appellant did bring his appeal within the section and that it was open to this Court to consider the grounds of appeal, the appeal should, nevertheless, be dismissed. Once the appellant's account of the occurrence was accepted, as it was by the jury, a verdict of manslaughter based on criminal negligence was, in the circumstances of the case, the only verdict which a reasonable jury acting judicially could return. With respect to the alleged misdirections, the jury having accepted appellant's testimony, it became irrelevant to the appeal to consider the validity of these instructions, and, in any event, no miscarriage of justice or substantial wrong resulted therefrom. As to the verdict, when considered with the evidence and the judge's charge, it meant no more than that the jury were indicating to the judge that one of the three types of manslaughter which it was open for them to find\u2014that is, due to criminal negligence, provocation or because of drunkenness\u2014they were finding him guilty of manslaughter because of criminal negligence.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Northwest Territories[1], affirming by a majority the appellant's conviction of manslaughter. Appeal allowed, Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. dissenting.\nA. W. Miller, Q.C., for the appellant.\nT. D. MacDonald, Q.C., for the respondent.\nTASCHEREAU J. (dissenting):\u2014I had the advantage of reading the reasons delivered by my brothers Cartwright and Fauteux, and I agree with my brother Fauteux that this appeal should be quashed. I only wish to add a few personal observations.\nThe jurisdiction of this Court is determined by s. 597(1) of the Criminal Code which is as follows:\n597. (1) A person who is convicted of an indictable offence other than an offence punishable by death and whose conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. 1960-1961, c. 42, s. 27(1).\n(a) on any question of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents, or\n(b) \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nI think that in the present case, there has been no dissent within the meaning of this section. I can find no conflict between the majority judgment and the one delivered by the minority, on questions of law.\nIn The King v. D\u00e9cary[2], it was held that the Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal because neither of the judgments of the two dissenting judges of the appellate court disclosed a dissent on a question of law within the meaning of (former) s. 1023 of the Criminal Code.\nIn his reasons, speaking for the full Court, Sir Lyman Duff said:\nIt is quite plain that the judgment does not rest upon any view of the majority upon a question which is a question of law alone.\nAnd further, at p. 84, he says:\nMr. Justice Walsh, in the reasons delivered by him for his conclusion that there should be a new trial, does not say, either expressly or by implication, that this conclusion is based upon an opinion that the majority proceeds upon any error in point of law alone. In Rozon v. The King[3], it was held that,\nthe appeal should be dismissed as the dissent in the Court of Appeal was not on any ground of law dealt with by the majority, and upon which there was a disagreement in the Court of Appeal.\nSpeaking for the majority of the Court, Mr. Justice Fauteux said:\nBeing of opinion that the judgment of the majority in this case does not rest upon a question of law alone and that the judgment of the minority rests upon a question of law upon which there was no expressed or implied dissent from the majority, I must conclude that it is not within the jurisdiction of this Court to review the answer given by the Court of Appeal, etc. ...\nThe same jurisprudence has been followed in The Queen v. Fitton[4]. In that case, at p. 978, Mr. Justice Cartwright says:\nIn my opinion the motion should be granted. After reading all the evidence and everything that was said by counsel and by the learned trial judge during the hearing and disposition of the issue raised as to the admissibility in evidence of the oral and written statements above referred to and everything said on the point in the reasons for judgment delivered in the Court of Appeal I am unable to discern any dissent on, or indeed any difference of opinion as to any point of law.\nThese judgments clearly hold that in order to give jurisdiction to this Court, there must necessarily exist a difference between the views of the majority and those of the minority. I can find none in the present case. The case of Brooks v. The King[5] is not an authority to support the contention that this difference of view is not a necessary element to confer jurisdiction to this Court. In that case the matter has not even been considered.\nI would quash the appeal.\nThe judgment of Locke and Martland JJ. was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the judgments to be delivered in this matter by my brothers Cartwright and Fauteux.\nI agree with my brother Cartwright that there is, in this case, a dissent\u2014as that expression in s. 597(1) (a) of the Code is interpreted in Rozon v. The King[6]\u2014upon the two questions of law to which he has referred. Accordingly, there is jurisdiction in this Court to entertain this appeal. For the reasons assigned by the learned Chief Justice of Alberta and by my brother Cartwright, I would quash the conviction and direct that there be a new trial on a charge of manslaughter.\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Northwest Territories[7] affirming, by a majority, the appellant's conviction of manslaughter before Sissons J. and a jury. S. Bruce Smith C.J. and Hugh John Macdonald J.A. dissenting, would have allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and directed a new trial on the charge of manslaughter.\nThe appellant was tried on an indictment charging \"that he at Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories on the 17th day of December, A.D., 1960, did murder Madelaine Marlowe contrary to section 206 of the Criminal Code\".\nThe facts are summarized in the reasons of my brother Fauteux, which I have had the advantage of reading. I shall refrain from repeating them but will make reference here-after to one or two matters appearing in the transcript which appear to me to require special mention.\nBefore turning to the merits of the appeal it is necessary to consider the question of our jurisdiction.\nWhile the notice of appeal contains a number of paragraphs, counsel for the appellant put forward only two grounds of appeal, (i) that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury, and (ii) that the verdict of the jury was ambiguous and the learned trial judge should not have directed a verdict of guilty of manslaughter to be entered.\nCounsel for the Crown submits that as to the second of the above grounds there is no dissent on a question of law by a Judge of the Court of Appeal which would give a right of appeal to this Court under s. 597(1) (a) of the Criminal Code. In his factum he puts this submission as follows:\nThere was no difference of opinion in the Court of Appeal upon the question of what constitutes criminal negligence or manslaughter; the only difference of opinion was as to what the jury intended to say.\nCounsel for the Crown does not in his factum make a similar submission as to the first ground of appeal, based on misdirection, and I did not understand him to do so in his oral argument; but, of course, neither failure to object nor indeed express consent can confer jurisdiction on the Court if the right of appeal is not given by the statute. My brother Fauteux has reached the conclusion that we are without jurisdiction to entertain either ground of appeal and both must be examined.\nFor the purpose of this branch of the matter I will assume that the case of Rozon v. The King[8] is authority for the proposition that a person who is convicted of an indictable offence whose conviction is affirmed by the Court of Appeal and who asserts a right of appeal to this Court under the provision of clause (a) of subs. 1 of s. 597 of the Criminal Code must show not only (i) that a Judge of the Court of Appeal dissented and (ii) that his dissenting judgment was founded on a question of law, but also (iii) that the question of law upon which the dissenting judge founded his judgment was considered by the majority in the Court of Appeal and that they disagreed with the view of the dissenting judge upon it. I use this form of expression because, with the greatest respect, if the judgment of the majority in the Rozon case does enunciate the proposition stated, it is my opinion that, giving full effect to the rule of stare decisis, it is still open to this Court to reconsider it on the ground that it is at variance with other judgments of this Court equally binding upon us and which were not referred to in the reasons in Rozon; an example being Brooks v. The King[9]. The fact that Rozon was followed in Pearson v. The Queen[10], does not preclude this reconsideration; for the reasons in Pearson simply follow Rozon and make no mention of the other judgments of this Court referred to above which were not dealt with in Rozon. It would not, I think, be proper to endeavour to enter upon such a reconsideration in the case at bar, because proceeding on the assumption that Rozon is authority for the proposition stated above I have reached the conclusion that we have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal on both of the grounds argued before us by counsel for the appellant. As to the first ground, that of misdirection of the jury in a material matter, the learned Chief Justice found that the misdirection occurred when the learned trial judge gave the jury additional directions, from which he quoted the following passage:\nI think the most serious objection taken by counsel for the defence was when I stated to you if you did not believe the evidence of the accused as to this being an accident that it, did not automatically follow that the verdict would be murder, and that the accused would still be presumed to be innocent until proved guilty, and that it was necessary for you to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he had the intent to murder Madelaine Marlowe. I think perhaps I should have gone a little further than I did, and made my remarks clearer than I probably did. All you have got, the situation you have then if you disbelieve that story, you have the evidence that the accused shot Madelaine Marlowe, but there is no evidence as to intent, or what intent he had in his mind when he shot her, and it doesn't rule out even an1 accidental death.\nIt is conceivable he might have shot at her, he might have shot at her with the intent of scaring her, or he may not even have pointed the rifle at her at all, but if he did point the rifle at her, it might have been a case of trying to scare her\u2014it might have been in itself an unlawful act, the unlawful act of point (sic) a rifle\u2014but in any of those things, any of those things would make it manslaughter, instead of murder.\nNow I don't know whether I can make myself any clearer, and in fact, I doubt very much if I have met the wishes of counsel for the defence, and I am afraid all I have done is to make this situation more confusing, but that is the best I can do.\nDealing with this passage later in his reasons the learned Chief Justice said:\nBefore concluding I wish to add, with every respect to the learned trial judge, that in my opinion he misdirected the jury, (a) in instructing them after they were brought back that any of the \"things\" set out in the second last paragraph of his additional directions and quoted by me at page 6, \"would make it manslaughter\", (b) in directing the jury that if the accused shot the deceased when he \"may not even have pointed the rifle at her at all\", \"that would make it manslaughter\".\nIt seems clear to me that in respect to the matters referred to in (a) the jury should have been left to find whether their verdict was manslaughter or not guilty as was suggested at the trial by counsel for the Crown. The jury were in my view directed to find manslaughter in any of the circumstances set out in the paragraph referred to.\nI am satisfied that the jury should not have been told that it \"would make it manslaughter\" if the accused had not pointed the rifle at the deceased at all, at all events unless there was coupled with this direction the qualification that in order to so convict they must find the accused was negligent in the degree required in manslaughter cases, or a reference to this requirement as explained earlier in the charge. Turning to the reasons of the majority it will be found that Parker J.A. did not disagree with the learned Chief Justice on this first ground; indeed he pointed out further errors in the charge. After quoting the second paragraph from the additional directions which had been quoted by the learned Chief Justice, Parker J.A. said:\nThis portion of the charge is not, with respect, completely sound.\nThe learned Justice of Appeal went on to hold that the appeal should be dismissed for the reason which he stated as follows:\nAlthough there are, with respect, certain deficiencies in the charge of the jury, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred and, accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal against conviction having regard to the provisions of Section 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code.\nJohnson J.A., with whom (except on the question of sentence) Kane J.A. agreed, says early in his reasons:\nThe two grounds of appeal which require consideration are, (1) that there was no evidence upon which to found a verdict of manslaughter, and (2) that the jury's verdict was in fact a verdict of acquittal, or alternatively, that the verdict indicated a doubt as to there being criminal negligence within1 the meaning of the Criminal Code.\nIt will be observed that this sentence makes no mention of the question of misdirection; however, later in his reasons the learned Justice of Appeal in the course of his discussion of the question whether the words used by the jury when they returned to render a verdict were unambiguous refers to several portions of the charge and says:\nAt the end of the charge, defence counsel objected that this latter part of the charge was bad because it stated that the story of the accused must be accepted before the jury could find that death was caused by accident. The jury was recalled and further instructed. The instructions on this point were preceded by the words \"if you disbelieve that (appellant's) story\", and what followed is not very clearly expressed. Much was made at the hearing of this appeal of these additional instructions but I think it is quite clear from their verdict that the jury accepted the appellant's account of what happened, for it is only on this evidence that a verdict of criminal negligence would be founded. That being so, these additional instructions to the jury became irrelevant as far as this appeal is concerned.\nWith the greatest respect to those who entertain a different view, it appears to me that when one judge holds that a passage in the charge to the jury is material and fatally misleading and another judge holds that the same passage is irrelevant they are in disagreement on a point of law. Turning now to the question whether we have jurisdiction to consider the second ground of appeal it is at once apparent that as to this ground there was direct disagreement between the majority and the minority in the Court of Appeal and all that has to be considered is whether the question is one of law. It is desirable to state precisely what occurred when the jury returned to the courtroom for the purpose of giving their verdict. The transcript reads as follows:\nThe Clerk: Gentlemen of the jury, have you arrived at your verdict? if so, say so by your foreman.\nForeman of the Jury: (Mr. H. McCaskill): We have.\nThe Clerk: What is your verdict?\nForeman of the Jury: We find death by accidental means, with elements of criminal negligence, and bring in a verdict of manslaughter.\nThe Clerk: Gentlemen of the Jury, do you all agree? (Each name was called, and each juror answered \"Yes\").\nThe Clerk: Harken to your verdict as rendered by your foreman, you find death by accidental means, with elements of criminal negligence.\nMr. Miller: In the light of the finding of the Jury, I am asking that Your Lordship direct that the accused be acquitted. The finding is that death was accidental, with elements; of criminal negligence, which indicates a doubt that it was caused by criminal negligence, and therefore the accused is entitled to an acquittal.\nMr. De Weerdt: I have nothing to say, except that I would disagree.\nThe Court: No, I am accepting the verdict of the jury as the verdict of manslaughter.\nIt will be observed that when the clerk directed the jury to harken to their verdict and proceeded to state it he omitted the final words which had been used by the foreman: \"and bring in a verdict of manslaughter\".\nIt will also be observed that the clerk did not use the form of question which is usual: \"Harken to your verdict as recorded ... so say you all?\" The reason for this would seem to be that the clerk rightly regarded the findings of the jury as reported by the foreman to be a special verdict upon which it would be for the judge to direct whether a verdict of guilty or not guilty should be recorded. While the argument that followed as to what verdict should be entered by the Court is extremely brief and the decision of the learned trial judge even more so, it would appear that the learned judge and counsel also regarded the verdict as a special one. Special verdicts in criminal cases are unusual; the Criminal Code makes express provision for them in only two cases, defamatory libel (s. 267), and cases in which evidence is given that the accused was insane at the time the offence was committed (s. 523); but the Criminal Code does not forbid the giving of a special verdict in any case and it is open to the jury to do so if they see fit.\nThe matter is put briefly and accurately in Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 10, under the title \"Criminal Law and Procedure\" as follows:\nat page 428:\nThe verdict may be either a general verdict of guilty or not guilty on the whole charge, or a verdict of guilty on one part of the charge and not guilty on another part, or a special verdict which finds the facts of the case and reserves the legal inference to be drawn from them for the judgment of the Court.\nat page 430:\nWhere a special verdict is returned, it is for the Court to act upon it and to direct a verdict of guilty or not guilty to be entered.\nand at page 431:\nIf the finding of the jury is ambiguous or inconsistent, and a verdict of guilty has been entered on it, the conviction will be quashed.\nIt is sufficient to refer to one of the cases cited. In Regina v. Gray[11], the prisoner was indicted for obtaining food and money by false pretences. After the summing up the jury retired to consider their verdict and upon their return handed to the trial judge a paper which they said contained their verdict. It read as follows: \"Guilty of obtaining food and money under false pretences, but whether there was any intent to defraud the jury consider there is not sufficient evidence, and therefore strongly recommend the prisoner to mercy\". The trial judge accepted this verdict and discharged the jury. After hearing argument the trial judge directed a verdict of guilty to be entered but at the request of counsel for the prisoner stated a case for the Court of Crown Cases Reserved. The members of that Court, Lord Coleridge C.J. and Denman, Mathew, Charles and Williams JJ., were unanimous in deciding that the conviction should be quashed. Denman J. said at page 302:\nIf the verdict had been guilty merely, no question could have arisen. But when the jury go beyond the mere verdict of guilty or not guilty and add words, they at once give rise to the question whether their verdict is sufficient. It is scarcely necessary to point out that the jurisdiction of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved was limited to deciding questions of law which: arose in criminal trials. The strictness with which that rule was observed is illustrated by the case of The Queen v. Clark[12].\nThat Parliament contemplated the giving of special verdicts in criminal cases appears from the wording of clause (c) of subs. (1) of s. 592 of the Criminal Code which reads as follows:\n592. (1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction, the Court of Appeal\n* * *\n(c) may refuse to allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that the trial court arrived at a wrong conclusion as to the effect of a special verdict, and may order the conclusion to be recorded that appears to the court to be required by the verdict, and may pass a sentence that is warranted in law in substitution for the sentence passed by the trial court;\nThe opening words of this clause \"may refuse to allow the appeal\" would indicate that but for the power conferred by this subsection the Court of Appeal should allow the appeal if of opinion that the trial court arrived at a wrong conclusion as to the result of a special verdict.\nThe Court of Appeal derives its power to allow an appeal against a conviction from subs. (1) of s. 592 and, in my opinion, it is only in clause (a) (ii) of that subsection that power is found to allow an appeal because the trial court has arrived at a wrong conclusion as to the effect of a special verdict; in arriving at that wrong conclusion the trial court has made \"a wrong decision on a question of law\". It will be remembered that s. 592(1) (a) reads as follows:\n592. (1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction, the court of appeal\n(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that\n(i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,\n(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or\n(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice.\nIn my opinion in deciding what verdict should be entered by the Court following the rendering of a special verdict by the jury the judge is deciding a question of law; the task of the jury has been completed and it becomes the function of the judge to interpret their finding and to order the appropriate verdict of guilty or not guilty to be entered; ad quaestionem facti non respondent judices; ad quaestionem juris non respondent juratores.\nOn the merits of the appeal I find myself as regards both of the grounds argued before us, in substantial agreement with the reasons of the learned Chief Justice who dissented and in whose reasons Macdonald J.A. concurred.\nI agree with the view of the learned Chief Justice that the learned trial judge should have asked the jury to reconsider their verdict, but as this was not done we must, of course, deal with the matter on the record as it stands.\nI have already quoted the passage from the reasons of the Chief Justice in which he found that there had been misdirection and I agree with it. His reasons on the second ground conclude as follows:\nI find myself unable to conclude what the jury meant by the phrase \"with elements of criminal negligence\" and where there is ambiguity or uncertainty in a jury's verdict and their intention is not clear, this court cannot speculate or guess what the jury meant. The confusion is added to by the clerk having recorded the verdict as 'you find death by accidental means with elements of criminal negligence' without reference to their words 'and bring in a verdict of manslaughter'. The jury made no comment when the clerk asked them to 'harken to your verdict as rendered by your foreman'. The jury may have accepted the accused's statement as to what occurred and found that he failed to act as a reasonable person, that is that he was negligent and that his negligence caused the deceased's death, but reached the conclusion that his negligence was not of the high degree required to prove manslaughter. There is so much doubt whether the jury intended to convict of manslaughter that in my opinion it would be quite unsafe to accept the jury's verdict as one of guilty of this offence and on this ground I would quash the conviction and direct a new trial. I do not consider that the verdict which the jury rendered is a verdict which can be recorded as a verdict at all.\nWith this passage also I agree.\nIt remains to consider the argument of counsel for the respondent based on s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code:\n592 (1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction, the court of appeal\n(b) may dismiss the appeal where\n* * *\n(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of opinion that on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred; It may be observed, in passing, that it is only in cases of which the court is of opinion that the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant because the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of error in law that it can require to consider subpara. (iii) of s. 592(1) (b) at all.\nOn this point also I am in agreement with the reasons of the learned Chief Justice and propose to add only a few words.\nThe finding of the jury has negatived any intention on the part of the appellant to injure the deceased. There was evidence on which it was open to the jury to find that immediately before the happening of the fatal accident the appellant was engaged in endeavouring to unload the rifle in case it should be loaded. The rifle was cocked and the appellant did not know whether it was loaded or not. He had not loaded it but apparently he was not satisfied of the reliability of the statement of the deceased that she had not done so. The rifle was made an exhibit; we had an opportunity of examining it and it was described by the witness Corporal Kirby of the R.C.M.P., an expert in the matter of fire arms. It is a .22 calibre rim fire, bolt-action, single-shot rifle. After a cartridge has been inserted and the breech closed the rifle is cocked by \"grasping the bolt by the tail and bringing it to the rear\". The rifle is then ready to be fired. It is so constructed that when there is a live round in the breech and the rifle is cocked the breech cannot be opened to permit of the extraction of the live round until the rifle is either discharged or un cocked. Corporal Kirby was asked how the rifle could be un cocked without firing it and explained that this operation \"requires both hands, one to grasp the tail of the bolt, and the second to release the trigger and then it is allowed to travel forward slowly\". It is obvious that if while this procedure was being carried out the bolt should slip from the fingers of the operator the rifle would be discharged. The concluding question and answer in Corporal Kirby's cross-examination read as follows:\nQ. And if one is not careless, but is careful, one might still accidentally lose contact with the tail of the bolt?\nA. Yes sir, and allow it to fire.\nIt appears to me that it would have been open to the jury to take the view that the appellant, engrossed in the operation of uncocking the rifle, was momentarily inattentive to the direction in which it was pointing; and on that view it would be a question of degree for the jury whether his conduct amounted to the \"very high degree of negligence required to be proved before the felony is established\"\u2014to use the words of Lord Atkin in Andrews v. Director of Public Prosecutions[13], quoted in the reasons of Johnson J.A.\nThe question was eminently one on which the appellant was entitled to have the verdict of a properly instructed jury; I find it impossible to say that had the jury been properly instructed they would necessarily have convicted him.\nWhile I do not found my judgment upon what was said by Crown counsel at the trial after the misdirection referred to above had occurred, it is worthy of note that, with exemplary fairness, Mr. Price submitted to the learned trial judge that it was open to the jury to find a verdict of not guilty and that he should so instruct them.\nFor the above reasons and those given by the learned Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal, I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction and direct a new trial on the charge of manslaughter.\nFAUTEUX J. (dissenting):\u2014Tried, last May at Yellow-knife in the Northwest Territories, on a charge that he, at Yellowknife on the 17th day of December 1960, did murder one Madelaine Marlowe, contrary to s. 206 C.C., appellant was found guilty of manslaughter. His appeal from this conviction to the Court of Appeal of the Northwest Territories was dismissed by a majority decision[14]; Johnson, Parker and Kane JJ.A., of the majority, affirmed the conviction while Smith C.J.A., and Macdonald J.A., would have ordered a new trial. Appellant now appeals to this Court.\nFor the purpose of this appeal, the facts adduced in evidence by the prosecution and by the accused, sole witness heard for the defence, need only be shortly stated.\nAppellant and the deceased were sharing a small one-room cabin on Joliffe Island in Yellowknife. The accused testified that, on the night of December 16, both left the cabin at 6 p.m. and, from that time to 11 p.m., consumed four bottles of wine with two other persons. Upon their return home at 11 p.m., appellant went to bed while Marlowe, already inebriated, left the cabin to obtain more liquor. Appellant said he became concerned with her condition and went looking for her at a neighbour's place where admittance was refused to him. Early in the morning of the 17th, he went out again and found her at a neighbour's place \"just about as drunk as I have ever seen her\". He brought her home and both went to bed. He got up in the forenoon when some visitors came. As he followed the last visitor leaving the cabin, he said that he glanced at the .22 calibre bolt-action, single-shot rifle which was behind the door in the porch, noticed that it was cocked and realized that it was dangerous because a little boy used to run around the premises. Having re-entered the cabin, he asked Marlowe, who was still lying in bed, whether the rifle was loaded and she answered it was not. He testified that he, none the less, proceeded to un cock the rifle and said: \"I don't know what happened, whether the bolt slipped or I touched the trigger or what but it went off.\" The bullet struck Marlowe's head in the left temporal region penetrating the brain in a straight horizontal direction. This fact, if appellant's story is to be believed, indicates that when he attempted to un cock the rifle, the rifle barrel was directly in line with the head of the deceased then lying in bed. Marlowe died instantaneously. Thereafter, and on three successive occasions, appellant admitted responsibility for the shooting. To McKechnie, the last visitor to leave the cabin prior to the event, he handed the rifle, saying: \"Here, Trapper, I did it. I shot her. You go to Scratchet's and phone the police.\" To Larsen, a neighbour, he said: \"I shot Madelaine Marlowe.\" And to the police, he declared: \"I shot her\" or \"I shot a woman\" and when asked why, he answered: \"She lied to me.\" After the usual warning, he said: \"I shot her. I don't care. I told Trapper I shot her and I asked him to phone the police.\" He then inquired whether she was dead and being informed that she was, said: \"Thank God for that. I won't write anything, and I won't say any-thing.\" At trial, he explained that when he said \"She lied to me\", he was referring to her statement that the gun was unloaded and that by saying \"Thank God for that\", he was expressing thankfulness for the fact that being dead she was not going to suffer. In substance, his evidence was that he had no intention of harming the deceased and the shooting was purely accidental. The jury were particularly instructed as to murder; manslaughter; provocation, drunkenness and criminal negligence, as incidents reducing murder to manslaughter, and directed that if the shooting was accidental and unaccompanied by criminal negligence, there was no crime. At the close of the trial, they brought in the following verdict:\nWe find death by accidental means with elements of criminal negligence, and bring in a verdict of manslaughter.\nRequested to say whether they all agreed to this verdict, each juryman answered affirmatively.\nAppellant then appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeal with the result already indicated.\nHis appeal to this Court purports to be lodged pursuant to s. 597 (l) (a) C.C., reading:\n597. (1) A person who is convicted of an indictable offence other than an offence punishable by death and whose conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. 1960-1961, c. 42, s. 27(1).\n(a) on any question of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents, or\n(b) \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\nIt behooves the appellant to show that the record discloses material enabling him to bring his appeal within the conditions prescribed by this section. While, in certain respects having here no relevancy, the text of this section differs from that of its predecessors, the section still, as did the latter, conditions the right of appeal given thereby to the presence, in the reasons for judgment delivered in the Court of Appeal, of points of difference between the views of the majority and those of the minority, on pure questions of law. Rozon v. The King[15] and the decisions therein referred to and applied; The Queen v. Fitton[16]; Pearson v. The Queen[17]. It is therefore expedient to compare the two sets of reasons, as was done by this Court in The King v. D\u00e9cary[18], to ascertain whether this statutory condition is here present. For the minority, Smith C.J.A., with the concurrence of Macdonald J.A., found (i) that there was doubt as to what the jury meant by their verdict; (ii) that there were misdirections in the following excerpt from the charge:\nIt is conceivable he might have shot at her, he might have shot at her with the intent of scaring her, or he may not even have pointed the rifle at her at all, but if he did point the rifle at her, it might have been a case of trying to scare her\u2014it might have been in itself an unlawful act, the unlawful act of point (sic) a rifle\u2014but in any of those things, any of those things would make it manslaughter, instead of murder.\nBeing unable to say that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred as a result of these instructions, he concluded that the conviction should be quashed and a new trial ordered.\nFor the majority, Johnson J.A., with the concurrence of Kane J.A., said that there were two grounds of appeal requiring consideration, namely (i) that there was no evidence upon which to found a verdict of manslaughter and (ii) that the jury's verdict was in fact a verdict of acquittal or, alternatively, that the verdict indicated a doubt as to there being criminal negligence within the meaning of the Criminal Code. He rejected the first ground as being un-founded, adopting, in this respect, a view similar to that of the Judges of the minority who would have ordered a new trial. As to the second ground, i.e., the meaning of the verdict, he also rejected it. While considering this ground, the learned Judge did refer to the criticism made in relation to the instructions above quoted and found to be misdirections by the minority. However, he expressed no view in the matter. He considered these instructions irrelevant as far as the appeal was concerned, in view of the fact that it was quite clear from the verdict that the jury had accepted the appellant's account of what had happened.\nParker J.A., said that there were only two grounds of appeal to which need was to refer, namely, (i) that the trial Judge misdirected the jury and (ii) that the jury in stating the basis upon which they found the accused guilty of man-slaughter used language raising a doubt whether they had proceeded upon the right principle. Considering at first the latter ground, he rejected it. As to the instructions to the jury, he said that while there were certain deficiencies in the charge, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred. In short, all the members of the Court agreed that there was evidence to support a verdict of manslaughter founded on criminal negligence; there was no dissent expressed by the majority on the views taken by the minority on the question of the validity of the instructions quoted above; the only point of difference is confined to the verdict held to be ambiguous by the minority and unambiguous by the majority. Hence the question is whether this disagreement is on a pure question of law.\nIt is certain that if the verdict is ambiguous, it cannot be accepted in that form. On that proposition, there is not the slightest disagreement in the Court below.\nBy definition, a verdict is \"The answer of a jury on a question of fact in a civil or criminal proceeding\" Osborn, A Concise Law Dictionary, or \"The opinion of a jury on a question of fact in a civil or criminal proceeding\" Earl Jowitt, Dictionary of English Law. In this particular case, the determination of the question whether the answer or opinion given by the jury on the facts is clear or ambiguous does not involve the determination of any question of law, nor was there any determined by either the members of the majority or those of the minority. The difference in the view they formed in the matter is not a difference on a question of law within the meaning of s. 597(1) (a).\nUnder these circumstances, I would say that the record does not disclose material enabling appellant to bring his appeal within the section and that the appeal should be quashed.\nI will assume, however, that contrary to these views, appellant did bring his appeal within the section and that it is open to this Court to consider grounds of appeal raised on behalf of appellant, namely, lack of evidence to support a verdict of manslaughter founded on criminal negligence, misdirections, and ambiguity of the verdict.\nNone of the members of the Court below found any merits in the first ground. A former soldier, appellant was familiar with the danger of loaded firearms. It was indeed that very danger which, on his own story, prompted him to un cock the trigger of the rifle. He did not rely on Marlowe's answer that it was not loaded. In performing this operation, he had a duty to take these ordinary precautions in the absence of which human life would necessarily be endangered. The elementary if not the only one called for was to make sure that during the operation the rifle would point in a direction opposite to that of the woman. The special hazards allegedly attending the un cocking of this particular rifle, whether known or unknown to appellant, did not minimize but rendered more imperative the duty to do so. Proceeding as he did while the rifle was directly in line with the deceased's head, appellant did show wanton or reckless disregard for the life and safety of the victim. In my view, once appellant's account of the occurrence is accepted, as it was by the jury, a verdict of manslaughter based on criminal negligence was, in the circumstances of this case, the only verdict which a reasonable jury acting judicially could return.\nWith respect to the alleged misdirections, I agree with Johnson and Kane JJ.A., that the jury having accepted appellant's testimony, it became irrelevant to the appeal to consider the validity of these instructions, and, in any event, as found by Parker J.A., no miscarriage of justice or substantial wrong resulted therefrom.\nAs to the verdict, Johnson J.A., with the concurrence of Kane J.A., had this to say:\nI have said that the verdict must be considered in the light of the judge's charge. It must also be considered with the facts of this case. I have said it was apparent that the jury accepted the appellant's account of the events preceding the shooting. It was the acts of the appellant as related by himself, which, taken together with and in the circumstances, related by him, that were criminally negligent. That evidence was not capable of being broken down into separate \"elements\" which could be believed or not without destroying the whole fabric of the explanation. The only exception to this was the conversation between the accused and the deceased about whether the rifle was loaded. That could be believed or not without affecting the narrative of events.\nThe language of a jury of laymen should not be subjected to minute scrutiny or to fine shading of dictionary meanings. When the verdict is considered with the evidence and the judge's charge, it means no more than this: they, the jury, were indicating to the judge that of the three types of manslaughter which it was open for them to find\u2014that is, due to criminal negligence, provocation or because of drunkenness\u2014they were finding him guilty of manslaughter because of criminal negligence.\nWith these views, I am in substantial agreement.\nI would, therefore, quash the appeal. Appeal allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed on the charge of manslaughter, Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Miller, Miller and Witten, Edmonton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: The Attorney General of Canada.\n[1] (1961), 131 C.C.C. 287, 36 C.R. 405.\n[2] [1942] S.C.R. 80, 2 D.L.R. 401.\n[3] [1951] S.C.R. 248, 2 D.L.R. 594.\n[4] [1956] S.C.R. 958, 116 C.C.C. 1.\n[5] [1927] S.C.R. 633, [1928] 1 D.L.R 268.\n[6] [1951] S.C.R. 248, 2 D.L.R. 594.\n[7] (1961), 131 C.C.C. 287, 36 C.R. 405.\n[8] [1951] S.C.R. 248, 2 D.L.R. 594.\n[9] [1927] S.C.R. 633, [1928] 1 D.L.R 268.\n[10] [1959] S.C.R. 369, 123 C.C.C. 271.\n[11] (1891), 17 Cox C.C 299, 7 T.L.R. 477.\n[12] (1866), L.R. 1 C.C.R. 54.\n[13] [1937] A.C. 576 at p. 583.\n[14] (1961), 131 C.C.C. 287, 36 C.R. 405.\n[15] [1951] S.C.R. 248, 2 D.L.R. 594\n[16] [1956] S.C.R. 958, 116 C.C.C. 1.\n[17] [1959] S.C.R 369, 123 C.C.C. 271.\n[18] [1942] S.C.R. 80, 2 D.L.R. 401.\n",

After such death the trustees were to divide and distribute one-half of the estate \u201cto among and between my grandchildren, per stirpes, in equal shares\u201d, and to pay all the net profits of the remainder of the estate annually to the surviving daughter until her death. The testator died in 1953 and was survived by his widow who died later in the same year and by his two daughters, one of whom died in 1959 leaving only one child, the appellant herein. The respondents were the three children of the surviving daughter.\nIn proceedings to determine certain questions arising in the administration of the estate, the trial judge held that one-half of the estate was available for distribution and that the four grandchildren of the testator were entitled to share equally therein. This judgment was affirmed by the majority of the Court of Appeal, and it was from the portion of the judgment of that Court which affirmed the declaration as to equal division of the estate among the four grandchildren that the present appeal was taken.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe gift \u201cto among and between my grandchildren, per stirpes, in equal shares\u201d was a gift to persons of different stocks but of the same generation \u201cper stirpes\u201d, and the testator\u2019s own \u201cchildren leaving children\u201d constituted the stocks between which the estate now available for distribution was to be divided \u201cin equal shares\u201d. Robinson v. Shepherd (1863), 3 De G.J. & S. 129, distinguished; Sidey v. Perpetual Trustees Estate & Agency Co. of N.Z., [1944] A.C. 194, applied.\nThe words \u201cmy grandchildren\u201d meant \u201cthe children of my daughters\u201d, and this being the case, the provision for an equal division of profits between the two daughters during their respective lifetimes by the use of the words \u201cto among and between both of them in equal shares\u201d, followed as it was by the division of the estate at their respective deaths, \u201cto among and between\u201d their children \u201cper stirpes, in equal shares\u201d, supported the view that equality of division between the two daughters during their lifetimes and their respective families after their deaths was a part of the testamentary scheme. This was the only construction which could give effect and meaning both to the words \u201cper stirpes\u201d and the words \u201cin equal shares\u201d used as they were with reference to a gift to persons of different stocks and of the same generation.\nThe provisions for payment of the illness expenses of all the grandchildren out of the estate moneys in the hands of the trustees could not be construed as reflecting an intention on the part of the testator to have the corpus divided equally between the grandchildren when the time for distribution came, particularly as such an intention would run contrary to that which appeared to be expressed elsewhere in the will to the effect that the two daughters and their two families were to be separately and equally treated as to the division of both the profits and the corpus of the estate.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming, by a majority, a judgment of Barlow J., respecting the distribution of a deceased\u2019s estate. Appeal allowed.\nJ.J. Robinette, Q.C., for the appellant.\nTerence Sheard, Q.C., for John Karavos, Loukia Karavos and Marina Karavos, respondents.\nJ.P. Bassel, for the executors.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014These proceedings were initiated by an originating notice taken out by the executors of the last will and testament of John Karkalatos (hereinafter called the \u201ctestator\u201d) pursuant to Rule No. 600 of the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court of Ontario to obtain the information, advice and direction of that Court upon the following questions arising in the administration of the estate under the said will:\n1. Is any portion of the balance of the corpus of the estate distributable at the present time?\n2. If the answer to question number 1 is in the affirmative, then:\n(a) What portion is available for distribution?\n(b) Who is entitled to share and in what proportion?\nThis motion came on for hearing before Barlow J. who rendered judgment declaring that one\u2011half of the estate was available for distribution and that the four grandchildren of the testator were entitled to share equally therein. This judgment was affirmed by the majority of the Court of Appeal of Ontario[2] (MacKay J.A. dissenting), and it is from the portion of the judgment of that Court which affirms the declaration as to equal division of the estate among the four grandchildren that this appeal is now taken on behalf of the infant, Maria Gettas, who is one of the testator\u2019s granddaughters.\nThe testator died on January 24, 1953, having first made his last will dated August 27, 1948, which makes provision for his wife out of the income of his estate during her lifetime, and provides that after her death \u201call the net profits\u201d of his estate, after paying the amounts required as a result of the illness of either of his daughters or any of his grandchildren, shall be paid annually to and between his two daughters in equal shares until the death of one of them, after which it directs that his trustees:\n\u2026 shall pay divide and distribute approximately one-half of my then remaining estate to among and between my grandchildren, per stirpes, in equal shares, and\u2014they shall pay all the net profits of the remainder of my estate (available in cash for such payment and distribution), annually and every year, to my surviving daughter until her death.\nThe testator was survived by his widow who died in 1953 and by his two daughters, Evaggelia Gettas, who died in October 1959 leaving only one child, the infant appellant, Maria Gettas, and Maria Karavos who is still living and has three children, John, Loukia and Marina who are all over 21 years of age and who are the respondents in this appeal. The question to be determined is whether, in using the words \u201cto among and between my grandchildren, per stirpes, in equal shares\u201d, the testator intended, as the courts below have found that he did, to designate his grandchildren as the \u201cstirpes\u201d or \u201cstocks\u201d so that each of the four of them would take an equal share of the portion of the estate made available for distribution by the death of Evaggelia Gettas, or whether he intended, as the appellant contends, to refer to the \u201cstocks\u201d represented by his two daughters so that one-half of that portion of the estate would go to the infant appellant, Maria Gettas, and the other half to the three children of Maria Karavos.\nIn the course of his reasons for judgment which were rendered on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal, Aylesworth J.A. reviews the relevant English authorities as to the meaning to be attached to the words \u201cper stirpes\u201d in the case of a gift to beneficiaries of more than one generation, and he notes the early conflict between the decision of Lord Westbury in Robinson v. Shepherd[3], where he held that the words were used to designate the different families of each of the first generation of beneficiaries, and the subsequent decision of Lord Romilly M.R. in Gibson v. Fisher[4], in which he disregarded Lord Westbury\u2019s ruling and held that the \u201cstocks\u201d were to be found amongst the immediate ancestors of the first generation of beneficiaries. Aylesworth J.A. notes also that the decisions of single judges in England in Re Wilson, Parker v. Winder[5], in Re Dering, Neall v. Beale[6], and in Re Alexander[7], follow the construction adopted in Robinson v. Shepherd, supra, but after considering what was said by Lord Simonds, speaking on behalf of the Privy Council, in Sidey v. Perpetual Trustees Estate & Agency Co. of N.Z.[8], he finds himself free to turn to a consideration of the present will \u201cuntrammelled by any hard and fast rule of construction\u201d.\nThe question of where to look for the \u201cstocks\u201d in the case of a stirpital division between beneficiaries of different generations which was the subject of the decision in Robinson v. Shepherd, supra, and the cases which followed it does not, however, arise at all where all the beneficiaries are of the same generation to which latter situation the following language used by Lord Simonds in Sidey v. Perpetual Trustees Estate & Agency Co. of N.Z., supra, at pp. 202-3 is directly applicable:\nIn the simplest case, where a gift is made to a number of persons of different stocks, but of the same generation per stirpes and not per capita, it is manifest that the stocks are to be found not in the takers, but in the ancestors, and this result is reached not by the displacement of any prima facie rule of construction, but by the construction of the language of the gift without any predilection.\nIn the same case Lord Simonds later had occasion to observe (p. 203) that:\nIf the division had been directed \u201cper stirpes among the children of such of my children as shall have left issue\u201d it could not have been doubted that the testator\u2019s own children leaving issue formed the stirpes.\nCounsel on behalf of the respondents sought to apply the reasoning employed in Robinson v. Shepherd, supra, and other cases where the beneficiaries were of more than one generation to the language of the present will on the ground as he put it in his factum that \u201cit is not impossible for a bequest to grandchildren to be made in a context showing an intention to benefit more remote descendants by substitution;\u201d and he contended that the use of the words \u201cper stirpes, in equal shares\u201d as they occur in the present will evidences an intention to provide for a substitutionary gift in favour of great-grandchildren of the testator. In support of this contention, reference was made to the case of In re Perlmutter\u2019s Will[9], which was a decision of the Surrogate judge of King\u2019s County in the State of New York, holding that in a gift to children \u201cper stirpes and not per capita\u201d the latter words must be taken as \u201cimplying a substitutionary gift\u201d, but it is not suggested that this case can be taken as establishing anything in the nature of a rule of general application in our Courts.\nA consideration of the cases of Strutt v. Finch[10], Hussey v. Dillon[11], Orford v. Churchill[12], and In re Hall[13], all of which are concerned with the meaning to be attached to the word \u201cgrandchildren\u201d, when used in a will, clearly shows that its primary meaning of \u201cdescendant of the second degree\u201d can only be extended to include remoter descendants when the context of the will demonstrates the testator\u2019s intention to use the word in this extended sense. I am unable to find that the use of the phrase \u201cper stirpes, in equal shares\u201d or any other language in the present will demonstrates the intention of the present testator to use the word \u201cgrandchildren\u201d in any sense that would displace its prima facie meaning to \u201cmy children\u2019s children\u201d.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the gift \u201cto among and between my grandchildren, per stirpes, in equal shares\u201d in the 14th clause of the present will is a gift to persons of different stocks but of the same generation \u201cper stirpes\u201d and that the testator\u2019s own \u201cchildren leaving children\u201d constitute the stocks between which the estate now available for distribution is to be divided \u201cin equal shares\u201d.\nThe majority of the Court of Appeal has, however, reached a different conclusion by a consideration of the words of the gift in the context of paras. 13, 14 and 15 of the will which read as follows:\n13. My said TRUSTEES, after the death of my wife, shall pay all such amounts, if any, as shall be required (after the death of my wife as aforesaid) by my daughters MARIA KARAVOS and EVAGGELIA GETTAS or either of them or the survivor of them, or by any of the children of either of them by reason of illness, for medical, surgical, dental, hospital and nursing services, and for supplies in connection therewith, and for transportation or other expenses caused by or resulting from such illness.\n14. My said TRUSTEES, after the death of my wife leaving her surviving both of my said daughters MARIA KARAVOS and EVAGGELIA GETTAS, shall pay divide and distribute all the net profits of my estate (available in cash for such payment division and distribution), annually and every year, to among and between both of them in equal shares, until the death of one of them; and, after the death of one of them\u2014they shall pay divide and distribute approximately one-half of my then remaining estate to among and between my grandchildren, per stirpes, in equal shares, and\u2014they shall pay all the net profits of the remainder of my estate (available in cash for such payment and distribution), annually and every year, to my surviving daughter until her death.\n15. My said TRUSTEES, after the death of my wife and both of my said daughters MARIA KARAVOS and EVAGGELIA GETTAS, shall pay divide and distribute all the rest residue and remainder of my estate to among and between my grandchildren, per stirpes, in equal shares.\nMr. Justice Aylesworth considered that the words \u201cto among and between my grandchildren, per stirpes, in equal shares\u201d spoke \u201celoquently of the testator\u2019s intention that each of his grandchildren should be treated equally\u201d and he expressed the opinion that if the testator had \u201chad a contrary intention it is unlikely that the word \u2018equal\u2019 would have been chosen\u201d.\nAs I have indicated, I am of opinion that the words \u201cmy grandchildren\u201d as used in the present will mean \u201cthe children of my daughters\u201d, and this being the case it seems to me, with the greatest respect, that the provision for an equal division of profits between the two daughters during their respective lifetimes by the use of the words \u201cto among and between both of them in equal shares\u201d, followed as it is by the division of the estate at their respective deaths, \u201cto among and between\u201d their children \u201cper stirpes, in equal shares\u201d, supports the view that equality of division between the two daughters during their lifetimes and their respective families after their deaths was a part of the testamentary scheme. It may be added that, in my view, this is the only construction which can give effect and meaning both to the words \u201cper stirpes\u201d and the words \u201cin equal shares\u201d used as they are in the present will with reference to a gift to persons of different stocks and of the same generation.\nThe decision of the Court of Appeal appears to be based also upon the \u201cconsiderable significance\u201d which Aylesworth J.A. attached to the provisions of para. 13 of which he said:\nTherein the trustees are directed to pay any amounts required after the death of the widow by his daughters or either of them or the survivor of them \u201cor by any of the children of either of them\u201d by reason of illness for medical expenses and the like. It is to be observed that there is no provision for charging such advances against any particular share; as to such expenses every grandchild is to be treated exactly as every other grandchild. It seems strange that the testator should have had in his mind such an equal sharing among his grandchildren merely up to the point of time of the first distribution of residue and then an intention directly against such equal sharing in the first or final residual division. Such an intention, in my view, would require words of plain meaning for its accomplishment.\nIt is to be noted that the directions given by clause 13 of the will relate to payments to be made from the estate in the hands of the trustees and that they are quite distinct from the directions subsequently given respecting the equal division of profits and the distribution of capital. I am, with respect, unable to construe the provisions for payment of the illness expenses of all the grandchildren out of estate moneys in the hands of the trustees as reflecting an intention on the part of the testator to have the corpus divided equally between the grandchildren when the time for distribution comes, particularly as such an intention would run contrary to that which appears to me to be expressed elsewhere in the will to the effect that the two daughters and their two families are to be separately and equally treated as to the division of both the profits and the corpus of the estate.\nIt was contended by counsel on behalf of the respondents that at the time when the will was drawn the testator must have been aware of the fact that it was unlikely, having regard to their age, that either of his daughters would have any more children, and upon this basis it was submitted that it would not be reasonable to assume that the testator intended that one grandchild would inherit one-half of his estate while the other three only inherited a one-sixth part each. There is no evidence before us as to the financial circumstances of the two daughters, and in my view the mere fact that one daughter had a larger family than the other cannot of itself have the effect of defeating the provisions for stirpital division contained in the 14th and 15th paragraphs of the will.\nFor all these reasons, as well as for those recorded in the dissenting opinion of MacKay J.A. in the Court of Appeal of Ontario, I would allow this appeal, set aside the judgments of the Court of Appeal and of Barlow J. and direct that the infant appellant, Maria Gettas, is entitled to one-half of the one-half portion of the estate now available for distribution and that the respondents, John Karavos, Loukia Karavos and Marina Karavos, are each entitled to a one-sixth share of that portion of the said estate. The costs of all parties should be paid by the executors out of the said one-half of the said estate, those of the executors to be taxed and allowed as between solicitor and client.\nAppeal allowed with costs of all parties to be paid out of the said one-half of the estate.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John J. Robinette, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondents, John Karavos, Loukia Karavos and Marina Karavos: Johnston, Sheard & Johnston, Toronto.

Trudeau, [1962] S.C.R. 398\nDate: 1962-02-06\nCanadian National Railway Company (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nDame Olivine Trudeau (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1961: November 2; 1962: February 6.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke, Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nCourts\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Construction of elevated railway line\u2014Obstruction of view\u2014Action for injurious affection in Superior Court\u2014Declinatory exception\u2014Exclusive jurisdiction of Exchequer Court\u2014The Railway Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 284\u2014The Canadian National Railways Act, 1955 (Can.), c. 29\u2014The Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 106\u2014The Exchequer Court Act, RS.C. 1952, c. 98\u2014Civil Code, art. 407\u2014Code of Civil Procedure, arts. 40, 48.\nThe defendant railway company constructed on expropriated land an elevated railway line directly in front of and alongside the plaintiff's property, and thereby obstructed the plaintiff's view of the St. Lawrence River and surroundings. The plan of expropriation registered in accordance with s. 17(1) of the Canadian National Railways Act had originally included the plaintiff's land, but notice of abandonment respecting that land was subsequently filed as permitted by s. 24 of the Expropriation Act. The plaintiff alleged that the value of her land had been depreciated and claimed before the Superior Court damages under art. 407 of the Civil Code. The defendant railway made a declinatory exception in which it alleged that the action was in connection with certain works done pursuant to an expropriation made by virtue of the railway's incorporating statute and the federal Expropriation Act, and submitted that the Superior Court was without jurisdiction.\nThe trial judge held that the Superior Court had jurisdiction since no indemnity was claimed for lands taken or for damages caused by reason of the expropriation. This view was upheld by the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side. The railway company appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. dissenting): The appeal Should be allowed and the action dismissed.\nPer Locke, Cartwright, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The Superior Court was without jurisdiction to entertain the action. The railway's undertaking being a work for the general advantage of Canada, its rights and powers were declared by federal legislation, and the right to exercise such powers could not be prevented or interfered with by Acts of a provincial legislature. The right of the plaintiff to recover damages for injurious affection, if it existed, must be founded upon s. 166 of the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 234, which provides that the railway shall, in the exercise of its powers granted by this Act or the Special Act (the Canadian National Railways Act), make compensation \"in the manner herein and in the Special Act provided to all persons interested for all damage by them sustained by reason of the exercise of such powers\". Section 17(1)(c) of the Canadian National Railways Act provides that the compensation payable in respect of any lands taken by the company shall be ascertained in accordance with the Expropriation Act, and that, for that purpose, the Exchequer Court has jurisdiction \"in all cases relating to or arising out of any such expropriation or taking\". While s. 17(1)(c) does not in terms declare that the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court is exclusive, compensation can only be recovered when provided by the statutes and in, the manner provided by them: in this case by proceedings in the Exchequer Court.\nSisters of Charity of Rockingham v. The King, [1922] 2 A.C. 315; Hammersmith Railway Company v. Brand, L.R. 4 H.L. 171; Jones v. Stanstead Railroad Company, L.R. 4 P.C. 98; The Mayor, Alderman and Citizens of the City of Montreal v. Drummond, 1 App. Cas. 384, referred to. The Corporation of Parkdale v. West, 12 App. Cas. 602, and North Shore Railway v. Pion, 14 App. Cas. 612, distinguished.\nPer Cartwright, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: Having conceded that there was no fault or negligence on the part of the railway, the plaintiff's only claim was for compensation the right to which was created by Act of Parliament which prescribed the manner in which that right was to be asserted and adjudicated. The jurisdiction to deal with the plaintiff's claim was conferred by Parliament exclusively upon the Exchequer Court.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ., dissenting: Section 17(1)(c) of the Canadian National Railways Act refers only to compensation for land \"therein taken\" and its provisions do not apply to what occurred in this case. There is nothing in the Railway Act, the Canadian National Railways Act, the Expropriation Act, the Exchequer Court Act, that purports to confer exclusive jurisdiction upon the Exchequer Court. In fact s. 44 of the Canadian National Railways Act permits actions against the railway in respect of its undertaking or in respect of its operation or management in \"any Court of competent jurisdiction in Canada\". Consequently, by virtue of arts. 40 and 48 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Superior Court had jurisdiction.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Marier J. dismissing a declinatory exception. Appeal allowed, Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. dissenting.\nChateauguay Perreault, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant. Wm. S. Tyndale, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting):\u2014By leave of this Court Canadian National Railway Company appeals against a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) of the Province of Quebec2 affirming the judgment of Marier J. which had dismissed a declinatory exception filed by the appellant in which it was alleged that the Superior Court had no jurisdiction either to hear the action or to refer it to the Exchequer Court of Canada. By my direction notice of the appeal to this Court was served upon the Attorney General of Canada and the Attorney-General of each of the Provinces so that they might have an opportunity to intervene. The only one who desired to do so was the Attorney-General of Ontario, who was given leave, but he finally filed a notice of withdrawal.\nThe declinatory exception recites that the action by the present respondent against the appellant \"is in connection, with an expropriation made by Canadian National Railway Company by virtue of its incorporating statute and The Federal Expropriation Act and with respect to works done pursuant to said expropriation although none of plaintiff's property remained taken by the expropriation at the time of the institution\" of the action. As has been pointed out in the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) this statement is not correct. While the appellant at one time had filed a notice of expropriation of the respondent's property that notice was withdrawn. In her declaration the respondent alleged that the defendant had constructed an elevated railway line directly in front of and alongside her property to a height of thirty feet; that prior to the construction of the elevated railway line her property had commanded an unrestricted view of the St. Lawrence River and environments and that as a result of the construction the value of her property had been depreciated, for which she claimed damages. It is true that the elevated line has been erected upon property of another which the appellant expropriated, but the respondent's claim is not based on any expropriation by the appellant of her property. By art. 40 of the Code of Civil Procedure the Superior Court is one of the Courts having jurisdiction in civil matters in the Province, and by art. 48\nThe Superior Court has original jurisdiction in all suits or actions which are not exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Magistrate's Court or of the Exchequer Court of Canada and particularly in all suits or actions for alimentary pension; saving the special jurisdiction of the Municipal Courts, the Commissioners' Court and the Court of Justices of the Peace.\nIn Southern Canada Power Company Ltd. v. Mercure3, the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) of Quebec, held that the Superior Court is authorized to consider every case which is not within the exclusive jurisdiction of another Court and this was approved by this Court in Fortier v. Longchamp4. At common law the same rule was expressed many years ago in England in Peacock v. Bell and Kendal5:\nand the rule for jurisdiction is, that nothing shall be intended to be out of the jurisdiction of a Superior Court, but that which specially appears to be so.\nThis was adopted by Mr. Justice Willes, speaking on behalf of all the judges summoned in The Mayor and Aldermen of The City of London v. Cox6, and in Board v. Board7, the statement of Willes J. was referred to with approval and adopted by the Judicial Committee.\nThere is nothing in the Railway Act, the Canadian National Railways Act, the Expropriation Act, the Exchequer Court Act or any Rules passed under the authority of the last mentioned Act that purports to confer exclusive jurisdiction upon any other Court in the circumstances of this case. In fact s. 44 of the Canadian National Railways Act, 3-4 Eliz. II, c. 29, reads as follows:\n44. (1) Actions, suits or other proceedings by or against the National Company in respect of its undertaking or in respect of the operation or management of Canadian Government Railways, may, in the name of the National Company, be brought in and may be heard by any judge or judges of any court of competent jurisdiction in Canada, with the same right of appeal as may be had from a judge sitting in court under the rules of court applicable thereto.\n(2) Any defence available to the respective corporations, including Her Majesty, in respect of whose undertaking the cause of action arose shall be available to the National Company, and any expense incurred in connection with any action taken or judgment rendered against the National Company in respect of its operation or management of any lines of railway or properties, other than its own lines of railway or properties, may be charged to and collected from the corporation in respect of whose undertaking such action arose.\n(3) Any court having under the statutes or laws relating thereto jurisdiction to deal with any cause of action, suit or other proceeding, when arising between private parties shall, with respect to any similar cause of action, suit or other proceeding by or against the National Company, be a court of competent jurisdiction under the provisions of this section.\nSections 164 and 166 of the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 234, so far as relevant read:\n164. (1) The company may, for the purposes of the undertaking, subject to the provisions in this and the Special Act contained\n* * *\n(d) make, carry or place the railway across or upon the lands of any person on the located line of the railway;\n* * *\n(k) make or construct in, upon, across, under or over any railway, tramway, river, stream, watercourse, canal, or highway, which it intersects or touches temporary or permanent inclined planes, tunnels, embankments, aqueducts, bridges, roads, ways, passages, conduits, drains, piers, arches, cuttings and fences;\n166. The company shall, in the exercise of the powers by this or the Special Act granted, do as little damage as possible, and shall make full compensation, in the manner herein and in the Special Act provided, to all persons interested, for all damage by them sustained by reason of the exercise of such powers.\nBy s. 16 of the Canadian National Railways Act the procedure to fix compensation referred to in ss. 207 to 246 of the Railway Act is declared to be inapplicable. By s. 17:\n17. (1) The Expropriation Act applies mutatis mutandis to the National Company, subject as follows:\n(a) any plan deposited under the Expropriation Act may be signed by the Minister of Transport on behalf of the National Company, or by the President or any Vice-President of the National Company, and no description need be deposited;\n(b) the land shown upon such plan so deposited thereupon vests in the National Company, unless the plan indicates that the land taken is required for a limited time only or that a limited estate or interest therein is taken, in which case the right of possession for such limited time or such limited estate or interest vests in the National Company upon the deposit of the plan;\n(c) subject to paragraph (d), the compensation payable in respect of any lands or interests therein taken by the National Company shall be ascertained in accordance with the Expropriation Act, and for that purpose the Exchequer Court has jurisdiction in all cases relating to or arising out of any such expropriation or taking and may make rules and regulations governing the institution, by or against the National Company, of judicial proceedings and the conduct thereof; (d) notwithstanding section 16, in any case where the offer of the National Company does not exceed two thousand five hundred dollars, compensation may be ascertained under the Railway Act, beginning with notice of expropriation to the opposite party; and\n(e) the amount of any judgment awarding compensation is payable by the National Company.\n(2) Lands or interests in lands required by any company comprised in Canadian National Railways may be acquired for such company by the National Company under the provisions of this Act.\nThe words underlined in subs. 1(c), \"therein taken\" make it clear that the provisions do not apply to what occurred in this case. If this be the correct interpretation, then such cases as Sisters of Charity of Rockingham v. The King8; Hammersmith Railway Company v. Brand9; Jones v. Stanstead Railroad10 and The Mayor, Aldermen and Citizens of the City of Montreal v. Drummond11, have no application. It may be that under the provisions of s. 27 of the Expropriation Act appellant could initiate proceedings in the Exchequer Court to have that Court fix the amount due by it as compensation for the injurious affection of respondent's property, but it is unnecessary to pursue that matter further because no such proceedings were taken.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Locke, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nLocke J.:\u2014This is an action for damages brought by the respondent in the Superior Court of Quebec against the appellant whose lines of railway are declared by s. 18 of the Canadian National Railways Act, 1955 (Can.), c. 29, to be works for the general advantage of Canada. The declaration alleges that the property of the respondent in St. Lambert has suffered damage by the construction of an elevated railway line by the appellant \"directly in front of and alongside plaintiff's said property\", which obstructs the view from such property of the St. Lawrence River and surroundings.\nParagraph 8 of the declaration reads:\nThat the said elevated Railway line has been constructed contrary to the zoning and building by-laws of the City of St. Lambert and in virtue of the statutory powers of expropriation of the Defendant. Paragraph 11 alleged, inter alia, that the said damages \"resulted from the building of said elevated Railway line which is permitted by the statutory powers of the Defendant.\"\nNo defence has been entered but the appellant has filed a declinatory exception alleging that the said action:\nis in connection with an expropriation which was made by Defendant by virtue of its incorporating statute and the Federal Expropriation Act, and with respect to works done pursuant to said expropriation\nand asks the dismissal of the action on the ground that the Superior Court is without jurisdiction.\nEvidence was called by the appellant as to the expropriation proceedings referred to in the declaration and the declinatory exception. Marc Dancose, a land surveyor employed by the appellant, identified a blue print of the plan which showed the area to be expropriated by the railway company which had been registered in the appropriate registry division on March 5, 1946, accompanied by a certificate signed by a Vice-President of the Railway Company, as required by the Canadian National Railways Act. The lands thus taken included the lands of the respondent and other lands lying between that property and the St. Lawrence River.\nThere was also put in evidence a notice of abandonment of the expropriation in so far as it included the respondent's and certain other properties dated December 28, 1956, signed by the said Vice-President, which was filed in the said registry office on December 31, 1956. Accompanying this was a plan showing the portions of the original lands which had been expropriated in connection with which the proceedings were abandoned. Such an abandonment is permitted by s. 24 of the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 106, applicable to proceedings of this nature by the appellant. The witness confirmed that the railway fine had been constructed upon the expropriated lands.\nMarier J., by whom the motion was heard, in written reasons said that the Superior Court had jurisdiction to entertain actions for damages against the appellant and that it was not necessary to decide if, in cases of expropriation, the Exchequer Court alone had jurisdiction or if its jurisdiction is concurrent with that of the Superior Court, since in the action no indemnity was claimed for lands taken or for damage caused by reason of the expropriation. On appeal12, this view of the matter was upheld, St. Jacques J., with whose judgment Choquette and Montgomery JJ. concurred, said in part:\nIl s'agit d'une action en dommages ne r\u00e9sultant en aucune fa\u00e7on, ni directement ni indirectement, d'une expropriation de terrain, mais uniquement d'un avantage sp\u00e9cial dont jouissait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la demanderesse, jusqu'au jour o\u00f9 la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux a \u00e9rig\u00e9 cette voie \u00e9lev\u00e9e et a priv\u00e9 cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de cet avantage qui lui donnait, suivant elle, une valeur marchande particuli\u00e8re.\nWith great respect, it is my opinion that the nature of the cause of action pleaded has been misconceived by these learned judges. The matter has been treated in both Courts as if a claim against a railway company for compensation for injurious affection such as this, resulting from the expropriation of lands and the construction of a railway line upon such lands, was to be dealt with upon the same footing as if, by way of illustration, some individual had acquired land lying between the respondent's property and the river and built a tall building upon it which obscured the view, the loss of which is the cause of action asserted in the declaration. This is not such a case.\nThe Canadian National Railway Company's undertaking extends throughout Canada and, being a work for the general advantage of Canada, its rights and powers are declared by federal legislation and the right to exercise such powers may not be prevented or interfered with by Acts of a provincial legislature.\nThe right to recover compensation for lands taken or injuriously affected is statutory and depends on statutory provisions: Sisters of Charity of Rockingham v. The King13.\nThe right of a claimant such as the respondent to recover damages for injurious affection, if it exists, must be founded upon s. 166 of the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 234, which reads:\nThe company shall, in the exercise of the powers by this or the Special Act granted, do as little damage as possible, and shall make full compensation, in the manner herein and in the Special Act provided, to all persons interested, for all damage by them sustained by reason of the exercise of such powers. This provision first appeared in the Railway Act as s. 92 of the Act of 1888 (c. 29). If it were not for this provision, there could be no claim for injurious affection resulting from the expropriation of lands or the construction of works under statutory authority, as pointed out in the judgment of the House of Lords in Hammersmith Railway Company v. Brand14, Blackburn J. at 196, other than claims based on a negligent exercise of such powers.\nThe question as to the forum in which such claims shall be adjudicated is one of substance and not a technical one. In Jones v. Stanstead Railroad Company15, an appeal taken from the Court of Queen's Bench in Lower Canada, the action was brought for damages against a railroad company constituted by an Act of the provincial Legislature for damage claimed to have been suffered by the construction of a railroad bridge, to which the company pleaded that the Acts of the Legislature empowered them to build the bridge and that there was no violation of the appellant's statutory rights. Sir Montague Smith, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee, said in part (p. 115):\nThe claim for damages in an action in this form assumes that the acts in respect of which they are claimed are unlawful, whilst the claim for compensation under the Railway Acts supposes that the acts are rightfully done under statutable authority; and this distinction is one of substance, for it affects not only the nature of the proceedings, but the tribunal to which recourse should be had.\nIn The Mayor, Aldermen and Citizens of the City of Montreal v. Drummond16, the above quotation from the Stanstead Railroad Company case was repeated in the judgment of the Judicial Committee and it was further said in part at p. 410:\nUpon the English legislation on these subjects, it is clearly established that a statute which authorizes works makes their execution lawful, and takes away the rights of action which would have arisen if they had been executed without such authority. Statutes of this kind usually provide compensation and some procedure for assessing it; but it is a well understood rule in England that though the action is taken away, compensation is only recoverable when provided by the statutes and in the manner prescribed by them. In practice it is generally provided in respect of all acts by which lands are \"injuriously affected\"\u2014words which have been held by judicial interpretation of the highest authority to embrace only such damage as would have been actionable if the work causing it had been executed without statutable authority. In that action, brought in the Superior Court of Quebec, damages were claimed against the defendant for damage alleged to have been occasioned to the plaintiff's property by the closing of a street which interfered with access to his property. The head note reads in part:\nThe special Acts relating to this corporation must be read in connection with 27 &. 28 Vict. c. 60, which prescribes the particular mode in which the compensation payable to any party \"by reason of any act of the council for which they are bound to make compensation\" should be ascertained. But actions of indemnity for damage in respect of such acts are excluded by necessary implication; for they assume that the acts in respect of which they are brought are unlawful, whilst the claim for compensation under the statute supposes that the acts are rightfully done under statutable authority.\nJones v. Stanstead Railway Company, approved.\nSections 207 to 246 of the Railway Act which provide the manner in which a railway company may expropriate lands required for the purpose of its undertaking and defines the manner in which compensation for the value of such lands or lands injuriously affected are declared inapplicable to the National Company by s. 16 of the Special Act and, in lieu thereof, the provisions of the Expropriation Act apply mutatis mutandis by virtue of s. 17 of the Special Act. Section 217 of the Railway Act declares in terms that questions of this nature are to be settled in the manner defined, that is, in case of disagreement, by arbitration. It could not, therefore, be suggested that if the claim advanced in the present matter were against the Canadian Pacific Railway Company the Superior Court would have jurisdiction. The question to be determined is whether it is otherwise in the case of the National Company.\nThe Act of 1955 continues the corporate existence of the Canadian National Railway Company incorporated by c. 13 of the Statutes of 1919. By s. 16 all the provisions of the Railway Act apply to the company, except those therein mentioned, including those referred to in the last paragraph. Section 17 declares that the Expropriation Act shall apply mutatis mutandis to the National Company and subs. (c) that the compensation payable in respect of any lands taken by the company shall be ascertained in accordance with the Expropriation Act and that, for that purpose, the Exchequer Court has jurisdiction \"in all cases relating to or arising out of any such expropriation or taking\" and may make rules governing the institution by or against the National Company of judicial proceedings.\nSection 44 provides that actions against the company in respect of its undertaking or in respect of the operation or management of Canadian Government railways may be brought and heard by any judge of any Court of competent jurisdiction in Canada. Thus, actions for damages for torts or delicts or breach of contract and suits of that nature are dealt with in the provincial Courts. This section has no bearing upon or relation to the determination of compensation of the nature referred to in s. 17.\nThe manner in which the National Company may obtain title to lands differs from that provided by the expropriation sections of the Railway Act. Under s. 17 of the 1955 Act, upon the deposit of a plan in the manner provided by the Expropriation Act, signed by the Minister of Transport on behalf of the National Company or by the President or any Vice-President of that company, the lands shown vest forthwith in the National Company. It is this procedure that was followed in the present matter.\nThe compensation to be paid in respect of lands or property taken or injuriously affected by the construction of the work is determined in the manner provided by s. 27 of the Expropriation Act. That section speaks of an information exhibited by the Attorney General of Canada but, applying the Act mutatis mutandis, such information would presumably be exhibited by the National Company. In the information the names of the persons considered to be interested are given and the sums of money which the Crown or the company is ready to pay in respect of their interest is stated. Such parties may appear in the proceedings as provided by ss. 28 and 29 and the judgment of the Court as to the manner in which the compensation is to be allotted is binding upon all such parties. In the case of such an action being brought without naming some person who claimed to be interested, that person may apply to the Court to be added as a party and to have his rights determined.\nThere is no evidence in the present matter indicating whether or not any proceedings were taken by the National Company to determine the compensation payable in respect of the lands taken for the line in question. The witness Dancose merely said that the railway had been built upon that line and that no offer of compensation had been made to the respondent.\nAs shown by subs. (c) of s. 17 of the Act above mentioned, the Exchequer Court has jurisdiction in all cases arising out of expropriations made by the National Company and that Court is authorized to make rules governing the institution, either by or against the company, of judicial proceedings. The respondent might, therefore, by petition of right have claimed compensation or damages for injurious affection, if so advised. Illustrations of such actions brought by persons claiming injurious affection when none of the claimant's property has been taken are Autographic Register Systems Ltd. v. Canadian National Railway Co.17 and Renaud v. Canadian National Railway Co.18. The Exchequer Court Act, s. 18, declares the exclusive jurisdiction of that Court in respect of claims against the Crown for property taken for any public purpose or for damage to property injuriously affected by the construction of any public work. The case of Sisters of Charity of Rockingham, above mentioned, was such an action. While s. 17(c) which declares the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court does not in terms declare that such jurisdiction is exclusive s. 166 of the Railway Act above quoted, upon which any such claim must be based, provides that it shall be made \"in the manner herein and in the Special Act provided,\" and the Special Act in this case is the Canadian National Railways Act of 1955. As was said by the Judicial Committee in Drummond's case, compensation is only recoverable when provided by the statutes and in the manner prescribed by them. In this matter the manner prescribed is by proceedings in the Exchequer Court. If this were not thus made clear, actions for damages would, in my opinion, be excluded by necessary implication, for the reasons given in that case and summarized in the head note above quoted.\nThe cases of Corporation of Parkdale v. West19 and North Shore Railway v. Pion20, do not touch the question in the present case. In each of those cases there had been a failure to comply with the statutory provisions, the performance of which was a condition precedent to the right of the appellants to possession and they were in no better position than trespassers: Saunby v. Water Commissioners21. The declaration in this case contains no such allegation and the evidence of the witness Dancose shows that possession was taken in the manner prescribed by the Special Act.\nThe question to be decided is of importance in all of the provinces in Canada since in all of them the provincial Superior Courts of original jurisdiction are invested with powers similar to those of the Superior Courts in Quebec described in art. 48 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nI would allow this appeal, set aside the judgments below and direct that judgment be entered upon the declinatory exception dismissing the action, with costs throughout. The dismissal should not affect the right of the respondent to take such proceedings in the Exchequer Court as she may be advised. I express no opinion as to whether the respondent has any enforceable right in respect of the matters alleged in the declaration.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Locke and wish to add only a few words.\nFrom reading the respondent's declaration it appears that the only claim asserted is one for compensation for diminution in value of her property, number 145 Riverside Drive, resulting from the lawful act of the appellant in constructing an elevated railway in proximity to her property. The declaration alleges that this construction would have been unlawful by reason of municipal zoning and building bylaws but for the fact that it was authorized by Act of Parliament. There is no allegation of negligence in the exercise of the statutory power or of any unlawful act or omission on the part of the appellant.\nIn case any doubt should be entertained as to whether the above is a correct statement of the nature of the respondent's claim I quote the following excerpts from her counsel's factum:\nWe readily concede that respondent's action is not based on fault or negligence or Articles 1053 and following of the Civil Code.\n* * * Respondent's claim is based, not on articles 1053 C.C. and following, nor on expropriation; it is based on article 407 of the Civil Code and on sections 164, 166 and 392 of the Railway Act.\n* * *\nAppellant, exercising without negligence its special statutory powers, has deprived respondent, at least in part, of the enjoyment of her property; she is therefore entitled to a just indemnity, Article 407 C.C, as interpreted by the authors and the courts, is ample to found respondent's action.\n* * *\nGranted that appellant is lawfully exercising its said powers, section 166 of the Railway Act clearly provides that appellant \"shall make full compensation, in the manner herein and in the Special Act provided, to all persons interested for all damage by them sustained by reason of the exercise of such powers.\"\nThe only claim asserted in the declaration is for compensation the right to which is created by an Act of Parliament which prescribes the manner in which that right is to be asserted and adjudicated. Article 407 of the Civil Code does not purport to enlarge or diminish that right, and it is unnecessary to consider whether if it did so it would be pro tanto ineffective.\nCounsel for the respondent submits that we are not, at this stage of the proceedings, concerned with the question whether the claim set up in the declaration is well founded; if this be conceded the fact remains that we are required to ascertain the nature of that claim and to decide whether the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec has jurisdiction to adjudicate upon it and to fix the compensation, if any, to which the respondent is entitled. The reasons of my brother Locke seem to me to make it clear that jurisdiction to deal with the respondent's claim has been conferred by Parliament exclusively upon the Exchequer Court.\nI would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother Locke.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorneys for the defendant, appellant: Perrault, Angers & Pinsonnault, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, respondent: Howard, Gate, Ogilvy, Bishop, Cope, Porteous & Hansard, Montreal.\n1 [1960] Que.

The water continued to rise, but with help obtained from another vessel the Mina C remained afloat and was pushed into a neighbouring bay where she was pumped out. When the vessel eventually arrived at its destination it was found that the cargo was in an advanced stage of deterioration as a result of water having entered the hold. In an action on a policy of insurance the trial judge held that the damage to the cargo was directly caused by the fact that the Mina C was \"sinking\" within the meaning of the policy. The Court of Appeal did not find it necessary to deal with the meaning of the word \"sinking\" and disposed of the matter on the ground that the loss was not directly caused by a peril insured against. An appeal from that judgment was brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\n\"Sinking \u2026 while being transported in any \u2026 motor vessel\" was one of the perils against which the cargo was specifically insured and this meant the sinking of such a vessel from any cause whatever including a leak and failure of pumps. The insurer was not entitled to sever the cause of the sinking from the sinking itself and to say that no indemnity was provided against damage directly caused to the cargo in the course of the process which culminated in the sinking on the ground that that process was initiated by a peril against which the cargo was not insured.\nHowever the words \"this policy insures against loss or damage by \u2026sinking \u2026while being transported in any \u2026motor vessel\u2026\" could not be construed as intending to afford indemnity against loss or damage to cargo while transported in a motor vessel which was in fact saved from sinking, as the Mina C was, by the timely action of others. The additional contention that the policy should be construed as affording indemnity against loss or damage by the sinking of the raw fish as distinct from the sinking of the vessel in which it was being transported and that the insurer was, therefore, liable for damage sustained by the cargo being submerged in sea water while in the holds, also failed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], allowing an appeal from a judgment of Macfarlane J. in an action on a policy of insurance. Appeal dismissed.\nD. McK. Brown, Q.C., and D. E. Jabour, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nW. J. Wallace, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[2] allowing an appeal from a judgment of Macfarlane J. and dismissing the appellant's claim for the loss of a cargo of 400 tons of raw herring by sinking while being transported in a motor vessel for which loss the appellant alleges that indemnity is provided by the terms of a policy of insurance issued by or on behalf of the respondents. The policy in question afforded wide coverage by no means confined to marine risks, but the provisions sought to be invoked by the appellant, which have been treated throughout as constituting marine insurance, read as follows:\nOn Stock consisting principally of Raw Fish, Fish in process, Fish Meal, Fish Oil and Packing Materials, whilst in the building situate\u2014Shingle Bay, North Pender Island, B.C., and anywhere else in Canada or Continental United States of America.\nTHIS POLICY INSURES AGAINST LOSS OR DAMAGE BY:\n***\n(i) Stranding, sinking, fire or collision, capsizing, careening or upset including general average or salvage charges and risks of loading and unloading while being transported in any coastwise steamer and\/or motor vessel and\/or approved barge or scow conveyance except as provided in sub-section (iii) hereof.\nThe provisions of subs. (iii) are not pertinent to this appeal.\nOn February 19, 1958, the motor vessel Mina C\u2014a former Royal Canadian Navy Minesweeper\u2014which was then under charter to the appellant, was packed with a full load of herring, the property of the appellant, in the two cargo holds and departed from the fishing grounds in the Queen Charlotte Islands on a voyage to the appellant's fish processing plant at Shingle Bay which would ordinarily have taken approximately two days. On the afternoon of the departure fairly heavy weather was encountered and it was found that the forward compartment of the vessel forward of the forward hold was partially filled with water, and it was necessary to put into Thurston Harbour where the compartment was pumped out and the cause of the leak repaired. The vessel put to sea again on the 20th and on the afternoon of the 22nd it was found that water had entered the engine room and that the action of the flywheel on the main engine had thrown water on to the generator which had shorted out all the vessel's electrical equipment including the pumps that pumped out the bilges in the cargo holds. As the auxiliary diesel pump ultimately gave out and the water continued to rise so that it was hopeless to try to control it with the hand pump, distress rockets were fired and the Island Prince, a coastal vessel, answered the call, but, as she had no pumps aboard, the Island Prince went off to obtain help from the Island Sovereign which was nearby.\nAt the time when the Island Prince arrived, the condition of the Mina C was described by the master as follows:\nI don't think at the time that the Island Prince came along there was any water on the deck although there was a little breeze at that time and there may have been a certain amount of slop on the deck. The vessel fully loaded has not too much freeboard.\nQ. Had it lost some freeboard?\nA. Yes, definitely.\nIt was evening before the Island Sovereign came alongside to transfer its three portable gasoline pumps to the Mina C, and by that time the weather was freshening and there was almost a foot of water on the deck amidships although the forecastle head was completely out of the water. The Island Sovereign pushed the disabled vessel into Hardy Bay where it tied up alongside a barge, and being sheltered from the bad weather the water was pumped out and repairs effected to the leaking stern gland through which it had been entering. The following day another vessel arrived and took the Mina C in tow to Shingle Bay, arriving on February 24 where it was met by Mr. Jackson, the president of the appellant and an insurance adjuster, in whose presence the hatches were opened, and it was found that the cargo was in an advanced stage of deterioration conservatively described by the master as being \"a little ripe\".\nIt is apparent that when such a cargo is being loaded, the squashing of the fish on top of each other results in blood and entrails exuding from them and that this material which is commonly called \"gurry\" is washed down into the bilges with the water that enters while loading where it is normally pumped off, but that if, as in the present case, the pumps cease to work and water comes into the hold the fish are not only reimmersed in water which of itself has a bad effect, but the gurry is raised with the water which is acid from the decomposing fish; it floats the gurry up through the fish and greatly hastens the action of the decomposition. There is no doubt that the cargo in question was rendered valueless as a result of this having happened.\nThe appellant's claim is asserted in paras. 10, 11 and 12 of the statement of claim in the following terms:\n10. The said goods were duly shipped in the said motor vessel on the 19th day of February, 1958, but during the currency of the said policy and while so insured as aforesaid, namely on the 19th day of February and\/or on the 22nd day of February, 1958, the said goods and all of them became a total loss by one or more of the aforesaid perils insured against in that on the 19th day of February, 1958, and on the 22nd day of February, 1958 the said motor vessel developed a leak and on both occasions was sinking thereby flooding the holds of the said motor vessel and causing the said goods becoming a total loss by deterioration.\n11. Alternatively the said goods were damaged and became a total loss by reason of the deterioration caused by the delay in continuing the said voyage, such delay being a direct result of a peril insured against, namely sinking.\n12. Alternatively, the said goods were damaged and became a total loss in that the incursion of sea water from the said leak flooded the engine room of the said vessel, thereby stopping the hold pumps and allowing the body acid of the said herring contained in the fluid excreted therefrom to accumulate in the holds such body acid causing the total deterioration of the said goods.\nIn holding that the damage complained of was directly caused by the fact that the Mina C was \"sinking\" within the meaning of the policy, the learned trial judge said:\nIf then, applying the principles of interpretation I have set out above, there has been no judicial definition of the word \"sinking\" and if the word is to be construed in its popular sense and the collocation of the words here is to be our guide, I think it may include the partial submersion of the ship. I do not think anyone can contend that when a ship becomes submerged to the extent that if help does not arrive, it will be entirely submerged that it is not sinking. If there is an ambiguity then I think the word should be construed\u2026 against the person responsible for its insertion.\nand he concludes:\nI think that the direct cause of the damage to the goods here was the intrusion of sea water in such quantities that it put the generator and pumps out of commission and that \u2026the failure of the pumps to work was simply an incident caused by that event and not a separate occurrence. I think that the plaintiffs should succeed\u2026\nThe Court of Appeal of British Columbia did not find it necessary to deal with the meaning of the word \"sinking\", and Davey J.A., speaking on behalf of the Court, disposed of the matter on the ground that the loss was not directly caused by a peril insured against. In so holding, he said:\nThe danger of sinking only arose because, after the incursion of water had submerged the lower part of the cargo so as to make its loss inevitable, it continued until it greatly impaired the buoyancy of the vessel. Thus the loss of the cargo was directly caused by the leak and the failure of the pumps which allowed the water to well up into the holds; neither is a peril insured against. The sinking condition was only a later incident in the chain of events that led to the loss of the cargo and unrelated to it.\nIt has now long been recognized that the liability of a marine underwriter is limited to losses caused by the direct operation of one of the perils insured against, and indeed the provisions of para. (iv) of the present policy expressly state that it does not insure against:\nLoss or damage by delay, wet or dampness, or by being spotted, discoloured, rusted, moulded, steamed, except the same is the direct result of a peril insured against. (The italics are mine.)\nAs Davey J.A. has said, a leak and failure of pumps are not perils against which this cargo was specifically insured under the policy in question, but \"sinking \u2026while being transported in any \u2026motor vessel\" is such a peril, and in my view this means the sinking of such a vessel from any cause whatever including a leak and failure of pumps. Under such a policy, if a vessel sinks and the insured cargo is damaged, I do not think that the insurer is entitled to sever the cause of the sinking from the sinking itself and to say that no indemnity is provided against damage directly caused to the cargo in the course of the process which culminated in the sinking on the ground that that process was initiated by a peril against which the cargo was not insured. With the greatest respect for the view expressed by Davey J.A. on behalf of the Court of Appeal, I am of the opinion that the main question for determination in this case is whether or not there was a sinking within the meaning of the policy.\nThe circumstances appear to me to justify the conclusion that when the pumps from the Island Sovereign were transferred to the Mina C the latter vessel was in a condition which would probably have resulted in sinking if no help had been given, but the Island Sovereign arrived in time to transfer its gasoline pumps and with their aid the Mina C stayed afloat while being pushed into a neighbouring bay where she was pumped out.\nNotwithstanding the doubts which have been properly raised as to the true construction to be placed on the language of this policy, I am unable to conclude that the words \"THIS POLICY INSURES AGAINST LOSS OR DAMAGE BY \u2026sinking\u2026 while being transported in any \u2026motor \u2026vessel \" were intended to afford indemnity against loss or damage to cargo while being transported in a motor vessel which was in fact saved from sinking, as the Mina C was, by the timely action of others. I have not failed to consider the argument which is based on the proposition that a ship whose decks are submerged in water is a sinking ship, but I am unable to overcome the difficulty which I find in holding that sinking has occurred in the case of this vessel which remained afloat and was ultimately brought safely to the dockside for unloading and I accordingly find that there was no sinking of the Mina C within the meaning of the policy in question.\nCounsel on behalf of the appellant, however, contended also that the policy should be construed as affording indemnity against loss or damage by the sinking of the raw fish as distinct from the sinking of the vessel in which it was being transported and that the insurer was, therefore, liable for damage sustained by the cargo being submerged in sea water while in the holds. If this was a policy which simply insured \"Raw Fish \u2026against loss or damage by sinking \u2026\" there would undoubtedly be some force in this contention, but under the provisions of clause (j) of the policy the cargo is only insured \"while being transported in any coastwise steamer and\/or motor vessel and\/or approved barge or scow \u2026\" and in my opinion the word \"sinking\" as used in that clause is so directly associated with other words such as \"stranding, careening, etc.\" which, in the context in which they are found, can only be meant to apply to the vessel, that it would be extending the language of the policy far beyond its natural and ordinary meaning to construe it as providing insurance against the sinking of the cargo while being transported in a vessel which remains afloat.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Bourne, Lyall, Shier & Davenport, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Bull, Housser, Tupper, Ray, Guy & Merritt, Vancouver.\n[1] (1906-61), 33 W.W.R. 420, 25 D.L.R.

The plaintiff alleged that there was also an agreement in which his interest in the claims was defined as 48 per cent, and it was on this alleged agreement that the claim advanced in the statement of claim was based, though an alternative claim, alleging the staking of the claims was a joint venture and that the interests of the parties in the claims were equal, was pleaded. The evidence of the plaintiff as to the alleged agreement was rejected and the Courts below dealt with the case on the footing of the defendant's evidence, according to which the defendant had agreed that if he decided to do anything further with the property he would give the plaintiff a share in it.\nThe defendant did decide to spend some money on initial development and advised the plaintiff that he would give him 10 per cent of the net return resulting from the development of the property as his interest in the matter and employ him in some capacity to assist in its further development. The defendant then prepared an agreement between a proposed company and the plaintiff whereby the latter, for claims discovered by him, was to be entitled to \"10% interest in the usual vendor's share of any new company formed by the Company on said claims or in any other sale consideration received by the Company in respect to said claims.\" Following the signing of this document additional claims were staked by the plaintiff and recorded in the defendant's name.\nDiamond drilling carried on upon the property indicated an extensive deposit of iron ore and, in the result, the defendant was able to effect a sale of all the said claims. In a subsequent action, the judgment of the trial judge declared that the plaintiff was entitled to 10 per cent of the moneys payable to the defendant after deducting therefrom defendant's expenditures made upon the claims. The plaintiff's appeal was dismissed by the majority of the Court of Appeal, whereupon a further appeal was brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. The proper construction to be placed upon the evidence of the defendant as to the arrangements made at the time of his original interview with the plaintiff was that, in addition to the cash payment made for the plaintiff's services in staking and recording the first group of claims, he agreed in the event of his deciding to develop or deal with the claims to give the plaintiff some fair share of the proceeds, if any, that were realized. Thereafter the defendant who was under no obligation to spend money on the development, before undertaking the very considerable expenditure which would be necessary to have the claims diamond drilled, settled the question of the plaintiff's participation in any sale that might be made by agreement with him.\nThere was nothing of the nature of a partnership subsisting between the parties at any time and neither the provisions of s. 27 of the Partnership Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 277, nor the rule at common law that in the absence of an agreement defining such interests all the partners are entitled to share equally in the capital of a business touched the matter. Briggs v. Newswander (1903), 32 S.C.R. 405, discussed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming a judgment of Lord J. dismissing the action. Appeal dismissed.\nP. E. Hogan, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nD. McK. Brown, Q.C., and D. E. Jabour, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] which, by a decision of the majority of the members, Sheppard J.A. dissenting, dismissed the appeal of the present appellant from a judgment of Lord J. dismissing the action.\nThe appellant is a mining prospector and on January 18, 1960, called upon the respondent at his office in Vancouver and endeavoured to interest him in staking certain ground in Vancouver Island which, it was indicated by a report in his possession, might contain deposits of iron ore.\nAs to what transpired between the parties at this interview there is a wide difference in the evidence tendered by the parties. It is, however, common ground that at this time the appellant signed a letter dated January 18, 1960, dictated by the respondent and addressed to him, which read:\nFor $1.00 and other considerations I agree to stake the two properties at Serita River and the iron property northwest of Maggie Lake as your agent. The respondent agreed to pay the appellant $250 to cover his expenses in staking and recording the claims and a further sum of $250 for his services, and these amounts were paid in part on January 18 and the balance on the appellant's return from Vancouver Island. The claims designated as C.C. 1 to 16 were staked and recorded, as required by the Mineral Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 244, in the name of the respondent.\nAccording to the appellant, who had denied signing the letter above mentioned when examined for discovery but admitted having done so at the trial, a further written agreement was made and signed by him on January 18 in which the respective interests of the parties in the claims were defined as 48 per cent to the appellant and 52 per cent to the respondent. It was on this alleged agreement that the claim advanced in the statement of claim was based, though an alternative claim, alleging that the staking of the claims was a joint venture and that the interests of the parties in the claims were equal, was pleaded.\nThe learned trial judge rejected the evidence of the appellant as to this and this finding of fact was accepted by all of the members of the Court of Appeal, the case being dealt with on the footing that the respondent's account of what had transpired on January 18 was to be accepted. According to the respondent, the only evidence produced to him of the nature of the ground proposed to be staked was a document referred to as Linderman's report, which the appellant said he had bought from the British Columbia Department of Mines in 1959. It appears that the probability that there was iron ore in the area had been reported in the annual report of that department in 1903.\nThe respondent's evidence is that, at the interview on January 18, the appellant had asked for a 50 per cent interest in the claims, in addition to the payments of money then agreed upon. This the respondent refused but said that:\nI made a proposal to him that I would take a chance or a gamble on this with the understanding that he would go and stake the property as my agent and that at some future date if the thing proved worthwhile I would give him an interest in it. And again:\nIt was to be at my discretion if I did anything further with the property. The majority of these things that you go and investigate never prove to be anything; I would say 90 out of 100, so I didn't see any point in going into a great deal of detail at the time other than the fact that he would act in the capacity of my agent and I would have complete control of the property at my discretion.\nDuring cross-examination, in answer to a question reading:\nSo, in other words, when he left you on January 18th part of the agreement was he was to participate in this ground?\nhe said:\nThat is correct.\nPrior to the staking and recording of the claims, an agreement as to the appellant's interest so expressed would clearly be unenforceable. Different considerations arise, however, when this was done and the property recorded in the respondent's name.\nThe arrangement made on January 18 does not, however, stand alone since the rights of the parties in the proceeds of the sale of the claims later made to the Noranda Company were subsequently defined.\nWith the information available to him after the staking of the 16 claims, the respondent estimated that there was a substantial ore body of magnetite or magnetic iron on the property. Whether it was sufficient in extent to make a mine could only be determined by diamond drilling. The respondent, a contractor by occupation, after making inquiries decided, as he said, to risk $20,000 to $25,000 in diamond drilling and initial development and, after informing the appellant that he was prepared to do so, advised him that he would give him 10 per cent of the net return resulting from the development of the property as his interest in the matter and employ him in some capacity to assist in its further development. The respondent says that the appellant accepted this, saying that it was very satisfactory to him.\nHaving made this arrangement, the respondent instructed his solicitors to incorporate a company to handle the work on the claims. The proposed name of this company was Western Ferric Ores Ltd. but, before the certificate of incorporation had issued, the respondent had prepared an agreement between the proposed company and the appellant and, while this document said nothing as to the arrangement which according to the respondent he had made shortly theretofore with the appellant, it appears to me to lend support to the respondent's version of that arrangement. By this document the company purported to agree to employ the appellant for two months from March 21, 1960, at $400 per month, in addition to an allowance for food and travelling expenses, and to supply him with the required equipment, the appellant agreeing to diligently prospect for mines and to record any mining claims staked in such names as the company should direct. For claims discovered by the appellant he was to be entitled to \"10% interest in the usual vendor's share of any new company formed by the Company on said claims or in any other fair sale consideration received by the Company in respect to said claims.\" For other claims located but not discovered by the appellant he was to receive a lesser amount. The agreement further provided that the manner in which the claim should be developed and the terms upon which they should be disposed of should be in the absolute discretion of the company and that the company might allow all or any of the claims to lapse. Following the signing of this document, nine further claims named Mollie 1 to 9 were staked by the appellant and recorded in the respondent's name.\nThe diamond drilling carried on upon the property indicated an extensive deposit of iron ore and, in the result, the appellant was able to effect a sale of all of the said claims to Noranda Exploration Co. Ltd. The agreement made with that company provided for a purchase price of $1,150,000 to be paid $50,000 in cash and the balance by the payment of a royalty of .50\u00a2 for each long ton of ore shipped by the purchaser from the property. In addition, the purchaser agreed to assume certain obligations of the vendor under a drilling contract and to expend a minimum of $25,000 upon the claims. The agreement, however, provided that the Noranda Company should not be obligated to expend more than $75,000, which amount included the cash payment, the company to have the privilege of continuing the work or abandoning the claims. The respondent, prior to action, offered to pay to the appellant 10 per cent of the cash payment of $50,000 made by him surplus to the amount of his expenditures for diamond drilling and developing the property, and when this was refused paid a sum of $2,900 into court.\nThe learned trial judge accepted the evidence of the respondent as to the making of the arrangement by which the appellant would receive 10 per cent of the moneys realized from the sale of the claims after deducting the expenditures made upon the claims by the respondent. The judgment entered declared that the plaintiff was entitled to that percentage of the moneys payable to the respondent after deducting therefrom the expenditures made by him amounting to $11,961.78 and dealt with the costs of the action.\nTysoe J.A., with whom Bird J.A. agreed, found that this finding of the learned trial judge was supported by the evidence and agreed with it. That learned judge considered that whatever obligation rested upon the respondent under the arrangement made in January crystallized into an obligation to give the appellant a 10 per cent interest in the proceeds of the sale under the arrangement made before the written agreement of March 21, 1960, was signed and that, from that time, the appellant's interest was established at 10 per cent and the claims impressed with a trust in favour of the appellant to that extent.\nSheppard J.A. considered that since the appellant, by virtue of the arrangement made on January 18, was entitled either to an undivided interest in the claims or in the proceeds of their sale and since, relying upon this, he had recorded the claims in the respondent's name, there was a resulting trust in his favour. Since that interest had not been defined by the agreement of January 18, 1960, he was of the opinion that the decision of this Court in Briggs v. Newswander[3], governed the rights of the parties and that, accordingly, it should be declared that the respondent held the claims subject to a trust as to a half interest for the appellant.\nIn Briggs' case the facts were that the plaintiff had staked two mineral claims in the Ainsworth Mining Division in British Columbia and the defendants had subsequently wrongfully staked the same ground. The resulting dispute was settled by two agreements made between the parties under which the defendant Newswander purchased the claims and agreed, inter alia, to immediately form a company under the laws of the Province and that Briggs should receive, in addition to a sum in cash, \"a reasonable amount of the stock of said corporation according to the value thereof.\" Instead of doing this, Newswander and his codefendants Crown granted the claims, failed to form the company mentioned and, relying apparently upon the vague nature of the undertakings in the agreements, proceeded to operate the property for their own purposes. The action failed before the Court en banc in British Columbia but the plaintiff's appeal was allowed in this Court.\nIt is to be noted that the head-note at p. 405 of 32 S.C.R. incorrectly states the result of the appeal. Sedgwick J. who delivered the judgment of the Court did say that, in strictness, upon the failure of the defendants to incorporate the company, Briggs was entitled to a reconveyance of the claims but, after consultation with the other members of the Court, he came to the conclusion that the relief granted should be to direct a conveyance to Briggs of a one-quarter interest in the claims rather than a one-half interest, there being in addition to Newswander two other persons who were also defendants on whose behalf Newswander had contracted and whose interests were equal to his own. As the report at p. 415 shows, Sedgwick J. considered that the rights of the parties were to be determined in accordance with a rule stated in s. 25 of the Partnership Act of British Columbia, R.S.B.C. 1897, c. 150. That section declared, inter alia, that the interest of partners in the partnership property should be determined, subject to any agreement, express or implied, between them, by the rule that all the partners are entitled to share equally in the capital of the business. Section 25 appears as s. 27 of c. 277, R.S.B.C. 1960. That rule, it was said, is merely a statement of what has always been the English law.\nWith great respect, I do not think that anything decided in that case affects the disposition to be made of the present matter where, by agreement between the parties, their respective rights to the proceeds of the sale have been defined.\nIn my opinion, the proper construction to be placed upon the evidence of the respondent as to the arrangements made on January 18, 1960, is that, in addition to the cash payment made for the appellant's services in staking and recording the first group of claims, he agreed in the event of his deciding to develop or deal with the claims to give the appellant some fair share of the proceeds, if any, that were realized. Neither party knew at that time whether there was enough ore in these locations to make a mine and, if it were an iron mine, it was never contemplated by either that it would be developed by the respondent himself, since to bring any considerable iron property into production would, according to the appellant's own evidence, involve an expenditure of at least $2,500,000. The respondent expressly stipulated that he should have control of the disposition of the property at the outset. Thereafter, as pointed out by Tysoe J.A., the respondent who was under no obligation to spend money on development, before undertaking the very considerable expenditure which would be necessary to have the claims diamond drilled, settled the question of the appellant's participation in any sale that might be made by agreement, and it was not until this was done that he incorporated the Western Ferric Ores Ltd. and expended the moneys necessary to ascertain the extent of the ore deposit and to stake the Mollie claims, to protect those originally staked. It is a proper inference from the evidence that it was upon the faith of the agreement so made that those expenditures were undertaken. According to the respondent, the appellant did not claim that he was entitled to 48 per cent of the claims or anything realized from them until after the respondent had agreed to sell the property to the Noranda Company.\nThere was, in my opinion, nothing of the nature of a partnership subsisting between these parties at any time and neither the provisions of s. 27 of the Partnership Act nor the rule at common law touch the matter. When the appellant proposed that he should have a 50 per cent interest at the outset, the suggestion was rejected at once and the arrangement was made which has been above described.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Hogan, Webber & Woodliffe, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Russell & Du Moulin, Vancouver.\n[1] (1961-62), 36 W.W.R. 1, 30 D.L.R.

City of Vancouver, [1962] S.C.R. 433\nDate: 1962-04-24\nMunshaw Colour Service Ltd. (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nCity of Vancouver (Defendant) Respondent.\n1962: January 30, 31; 1962: April 24.\nPresent: Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nNegligence\u2014Sewer flushing operations by municipality in vicinity of film developer's premises\u2014Sediment in mains stirred up by opening of hydrant\u2014Heavily sedimented water reaching processing tanks and damaging film therein\u2014Failure of plaintiff's filter system\u2014Whether municipality liable for negligence.\nIn the course of sewer flushing operations carried on by the defendant municipality sediment was stirred up, due to the opening of a hydrant, in the city's water-mains in the vicinity of the premises of the plaintiff's film developing business. As a result, heavily sedimented water reached the plaintiff's processing tanks and damaged film then being processed. Because of an unexplained breakdown the plaintiff's filter system had failed to work properly. In proceedings brought against the city and the local water district, the trial judge gave judgment against the city and dismissed the action against the water district. On appeal, this judgment was set aside, one judge dissenting. The plaintiff then appealed to this Court pursuant to leave granted by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright and Ritchie JJ.: The evidence did not warrant a finding that there was so great an accumulation of sediment in the water-mains that the failure to have removed it amounted to negligence.\nThe contention that the defendant was negligent in failing to notify the plaintiff that the hydrant was going to be opened was rejected. The defendant, through its agents, knew that the opening of the hydrant would tend to stir up some sediment but it had no reason to anticipate that so great a quantity of sediment would be stirred up and no means of knowing whether it would be likely to reach the premises of the plaintiff. Even if it were held that the city should have foreseen that an undue amount of sediment would be contained in the water reaching the plaintiff's premises, a reasonable person in the position of the city would not have foreseen that it would do any damage. The giving of a warning would not have prevented the damage, as it was altogether probable that the plaintiff would have gone ahead with its usual operations relying upon its filter system to protect its product.\nIf, as was held by the trial judge, the evidence adduced by the plaintiff raised a presumption of negligence on the part of the city, the evidence taken as a whole rebutted that presumption.\nPer Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ.: The plaintiff, as one who used water for processing colour films, was a consumer of extraordinary sensitivity; he could not use the water without filtering it at all times. If, therefore, his filtration system broke down through no fault of the city, the special loss was to be assumed by him. The use of the hydrant for sewer flushing purposes, an ordinary everyday procedure, could not in itself be negligence, nor could it be negligence even if considered in relation to the presence of sediment in the underground pipes. The city had been using the procedure for two days before there was any complaint and there was no evidence to suggest that it should have known that the use of the hydrant would stir up more silt than it had done on other occasions. There was no reason for the defendant to warn anyone of the operation; to impose on the city the duty of notice in the circumstances was to require a standard of perfection.\nIt was not negligence on the part of the city employee to fail, as no doubt he did, to think about the effect of opening the hydrant upon water consumers of peculiar sensitivity. Neither was it negligence to fail to clean out the sediment in the pipes; to say that the city must periodically flush the pipes to remove the sediment so that this particular kind of consumer would not be affected was again to impose too high a duty on a municipal waterworks system.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing a judgment of Lett C.J.S.C. Appeal dismissed.\nC. C. Locke, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nB. E. Emerson and C. S. G. C. Fleming, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The facts out of which this appeal arises are set out in detail in the reasons of Lett C.J. and are summarized in the reasons of my brother Judson.\nIn maintaining and operating its system of water-mains and other water-pipes and carrying on its undertaking of supplying water the respondent was doing that which the legislature has authorized it to do. Counsel for the appellant did not question the finding of the learned Chief Justice that the city was not under an absolute statutory duty to supply water of a specified quality or standard. Counsel for the respondent conceded that the city would be liable for the damages suffered by the appellant if the city was guilty of negligence in its operations and that negligence caused the plaintiff's damage.\nThe grounds upon which the learned Chief Justice held the respondent liable are set out in the following passages in his reasons:\nI hold that the Plaintiff has established negligence upon the part of the City consisting of (1) supplying water from its mains to the Plaintiff which was not wholesome or ordinarily pure and was unfit for ordinary domestic purposes or ordinary human consumption;\n(2) in permitting a hydrant in the vicinity of the Plaintiff's premises to be turned on when it knew or ought to have known that the sediment known to be in its mains was thereby likely to be released and likely to result in delivery to the Plaintiff of water which was not of proper quality;\n(3) in failing either to take steps to remove the sediment from its water mains by means not injurious to the Plaintiff, or to warn the Plaintiff in advance that the means to be used by the City were liable to result in delivery to the Plaintiff of water which was not of proper quality.\n***\nIf I am in error in my findings of negligence against the City, then in my view the evidence adduced by the Plaintiff has raised a presumption which the City has not satisfactorily answered or explained so as to absolve itself from the implication of negligence: (See judgment of Ever-shed M.R. in Moore v. R. Fox & Sons, [1956] 1 Q.B. at p. 610), and in my view, as Lord Evershed M.R. stated at p. 611\u2014\"the sum of the Defendant's evidence was not to explain the accident, but to show that it was inexplicable\".\nIn the Court of Appeal[2] O'Halloran J.A., who would have upheld the judgment given at the trial, was of opinion that the city \"owed a common sense duty\" to notify the plaintiff that it planned flushing the sewers from the hydrant; he ends his reasons as follows:\nThe negligence of the appellant is found as a matter of inference from the known evidential circumstances coupled with appellant's failure to notify respondent that it was going to clear the sewers during the day in question.\nWith respect, by reason of the preponderance of the evidence, the nature of the damage to the licenced operation of the respondent was foreseeable by the City and hence notice should have been given the respondent to enable it to withhold its operations during the hours the City was engaged in clearing the sewers in respondent's neighbourhood.\nAs is pointed out in the reasons of my brother Judson, Davey J.A. with whom Sheppard J.A. agreed, based his judgment upon two grounds. I find it necessary to consider only the second of these, i.e., that the city was not guilty of negligence either in failing to remove the sediment from the water-mains or in failing to notify the plaintiff of its intention to have the hydrant opened.\nI agree with Davey J.A. that in the circumstances of this case, the city was not under a duty to use procedures for cleaning out its water-mains that are not in general use. No doubt if sediment accumulated in the mains to such an extent that as a result it frequently happened that the water delivered was not wholesome or ordinarily pure and was unfit for ordinary domestic purposes or ordinary human consumption a duty to use all reasonable diligence to remedy the situation would fall upon the city; but the evidence does not warrant a finding that there was so great an accumulation of sediment that the failure to have removed it amounted to negligence.\nThe contention that the city was negligent in failing to notify the plaintiff that the hydrant was going to be opened is based on the submissions, (i) that the city knew or ought to have known that the opening of the hydrant might cause an undue amount of sediment to be contained in the water delivered to the plaintiff's premises, (ii) that a reasonable person in the position of the city should have foreseen that if this happened it would cause damage to the plaintiff, and (iii) that the giving of the notification would have resulted in the damage being avoided. There is little, if any, dispute as to the primary facts of this case and the question is as to what inferences should be drawn from them.\nAs to the first of these submissions, it appears to me that the proper inference to be drawn from the evidence is that the city, through its agents, knew that the opening of the hydrant would tend to stir up some sediment but that it had no reason to anticipate that so great a quantity of sediment would be stirred up as was in fact stirred up and no means of knowing whether it would be likely to reach the premises of the plaintiff situate on another street and at a distance of 1,250 feet. It is significant that while the same hydrant had been used for the same purpose on the two days preceding the damage suffered by the plaintiff the evidence does not suggest that on those days any undue amount of sediment was contained in the water received by the plaintiff.\nAs to the second submission, it is my opinion that even if it were held that the city should have foreseen that an undue amount of sediment would be contained in the water reaching the plaintiff's premises, a reasonable person in the position of the city would not have foreseen that it would do any damage. It would in fact have done no damage but for the unforeseen and unexplained failure of the plaintiff's filter system.\nAs to the third submission, it is necessary to consider the nature of the notification which the city should have given to the plaintiff, assuming it was under a duty to give one. It could not give notice that a large quantity of sediment would be contained in the water delivered to the plaintiff, for it did not know whether or not this would happen. The duty to give the notification, if it existed at all, existed equally on the two preceding days. I suppose the notice should have been worded somewhat as follows: \"At\u2014 o'clock to-morrow the hydrant at the northwest corner of Helmcken and Homer Streets will be partially opened for the purpose of flushing sewers, this operation will continue until \u2014 o'clock. This may stir up sediment in the mains and may result in the water delivered to you containing a large amount of sediment.\" If such a notice had been given, what course would the plaintiff have been likely to pursue? One of the inferences drawn by the learned Chief Justice in his reasons is:\nThat if Plaintiff had been warned in advance of the proposed sewer-clearing operations it could have taken precautions to avoid the damage to the films.\nThe learned Chief Justice does not specify what precautions the plaintiff could have taken. In the factum of the appellant it is said that obviously it could have deferred its operations; but it appears to me very unlikely that it would have done so, particularly in view of the fact that the opening of the hydrant on the two preceding days had not had any observable ill effect on the quality of the water supplied. It is, I think, altogether probable that the appellant would have gone ahead with its usual operations relying upon its filter system to protect its product. I share the view of Davey J.A. that the giving of a warning would not have prevented the damage.\nIf, as held by the learned Chief Justice, the evidence adduced by the plaintiff raised a presumption of negligence on the part of the city, it is my opinion that the evidence taken as a whole rebutted that presumption. For the above reasons, and for those given by Davey J.A. on this branch of the matter, I have reached the conclusion that in carrying out its undertaking of supplying water the respondent was not guilty of any negligence which caused the damage suffered by the appellant.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The appellant carries on the business of developing and finishing photographic coloured film in the City of Vancouver. On August 1, 1957, it claimed that heavily sedimented water had reached its processing tanks from the city's water system and had damaged large quantities of film then being processed. It brought an action for damages against the city and the Greater Vancouver Water District. The action was dismissed against the water district but the trial judge gave judgment against the city for $3,694.89. On appeal, this judgment was set aside, O'Halloran J. dissenting. The plaintiff now appeals to this Court pursuant to leave granted by the British Columbia Court of Appeal.\nThe City of Vancouver purchases its water from the Greater Vancouver Water District and distributes it to the consumer through a grid system of water-mains under the streets. It supplies water to domestic, commercial and industrial consumers. On the morning of August 1, 1957, and for two days previously a crew of city workmen had been engaged in cleaning and flushing sewers on Homer Street between Davie and Helmcken Streets. To do this the workmen connected a hose to a fire hydrant located at the northwest corner of Helmcken and Homer Streets, 1,250 feet from the appellant's premises. The complaint about the sedimented water was received by the waterworks department about mid-morning on August 1. It was given immediate attention and the fire hydrant was turned off, but by this time the damage had been done, the sedimented water being already in the tanks. After the hydrant had been shut off the water being delivered to the appellant returned to its normal condition. The findings of the learned Chief Justice at trial show\n(a) That the water supplied by the water district to the city contains a certain amount of sediment but that except for some slight discolouration in freshet seasons, is ordinarily and consistently of excellent quality;\n(b) That it was the sediment in the water that damaged the plaintiff's films and that this sediment included sand and iron oxide;\n(c) That the filter system of the plaintiff was ordinarily effective to accomplish its purpose of eliminating from the water particles of sediment larger in size than 25 microns;\n(d) That the filter system of the plaintiff broke down and permitted entry into the plaintiff's tanks, of particles of sediment of a size larger than 25 microns. No witness was able to explain why the filter system broke down. It was designed to permit the passage of sediment not larger than 25 microns, but the evidence disclosed that particles as large as 74 microns were found in the tanks of the processing machines. It was not satisfactorily established that the breakdown in the filter system was caused by \"bursts\" or changes in pressure or velocity of the water supplied by the city;\n(e) That the city knew or ought to have known that there was sediment consisting of particles of sand and rust in its water-mains in the vicinity of the plaintiff's premises and that it knew or ought to have known that the sewer flushing operation within 1,250 feet of the plaintiff's premises was likely to cause the sediment to be disturbed so that it could enter the plaintiff's premises.\nThe inference drawn by the learned Chief Justice from all this was that it was the opening of the hydrant on August 1 that did stir up the sediment in the city's pipes and caused the damage. It is admitted that no warning of the sewer clearing operation was given by the city to the plaintiff or anyone else. The city's powers in connection with the supply of water are to be found in the Vancouver Charter, 1953 (B.C.), c. 55, in the following sections:\n300. The Council may provide \u2026\n(a) For acquiring water from the Greater Vancouver Water District, or elsewhere, and for distributing, supplying, and making it available for use to persons within the city at such rates and upon such terms and conditions as may be provided by by-law, \u2026\n(b) For the construction, installation, maintenance, repair, and regulation of a system of water-mains and other water-pipes, including valves, fittings, hydrants, meters, and other necessary appliances and equipment, for the purpose of such distribution and supply \u2026\n330. The Council may make by-laws:\n(d) For providing for the periodical examination and analysis of the water supplied by the city and for tests as to its purity and wholesomeness.\nIt was admitted that there is no statutory duty upon the city to supply water of a specified quality or standard. The litigation was therefore conducted on the basis that the city had done negligently what it was authorized to do by statute and it seems obvious that the negligence, if any, must be found in\n(i) conducting the sewer cleaning operation by the use of water from a hydrant;\n(ii) failure to warn;\n(iii) stirring up the sediment in the pipes; and\n(iv) possibly allowing sediment to collect in the pipes so that it could be stirred up by an operation of this kind.\nThe learned Chief Justice made the following findings of negligence:\n1. That the water on this occasion was not wholesome or ordinarily pure and was unfit for ordinary domestic purposes or ordinary human consumption.\n2. That the city was negligent\n(a) in turning on the hydrant in the vicinity of the plaintiff's premises when it knew or ought to have known that the sediment was likely to be stirred up and delivered to the plaintiff's premises;\n(b) in failing to take steps to remove the sediment from its main or to warn the plaintiff in advance that the means to be used by the city were liable to result in the delivery to the plaintiff of water containing the sediment and the rust. The Court of Appeal founded its judgment on two grounds. It said in effect that the damage was done by the failure of the filter system and that in opening the hydrant for sewer flushing purposes the city was following ordinary routine practice, which could not involve it in liability for an accident of this kind.\nThe plaintiff was conducting a very sensitive operation and had at all times to filter the water in order to exclude pieces of sediment larger than 25 microns. The evidence furnished no explanation of the breakdown in the filter system. In the past, when a situation of this kind had arisen, the filter system had done the work for which it was intended by stopping the larger particles and eventually clogging up and obstructing the flow of water. The Court of Appeal found that everybody knew that there would be occasionally excessive amounts of sediment in the water and that there was nothing in the city's experience from which it ought to have foreseen that the flushing of the sewer from the hydrant in question would be likely to stir up more silt than on other occasions when the use of hydrants had caused temporary departures from ordinary standards of purity, with which departures the consumers were familiar.\nThis finding is linked to the filtration problem within the appellant's plant. This kind of disturbance does no harm to the ordinary consumer. He can see the water coming through the tap. He lets the tap run until the water comes clear. He does not drink or use turbid water. If he did it would not be harmful to health but might be unpleasant to taste. But a consumer of extraordinary sensitivity, such as one who is using water for processing colour films, must at all times filter the water. He cannot use it without doing this. If, therefore, his filtration system breaks down through no fault of the city, he must assume the special loss.\nIt seems to me clear that the Court of Appeal has declined to accept the findings of negligence made by the learned trial judge and I think it was right in so doing. The use of the hydrant for sewer flushing purposes was an ordinary everyday procedure. How else is it possible to flush sewers? The use of this procedure, in itself, cannot be negligence. Nor do I think it can be negligence even if it is considered in relation to the presence of silt and rust in the underground pipes. The city had been using this procedure for two days before there was any complaint and there is no evidence to suggest that it should have known that the use of the hydrant would stir up more silt than it had done on other occasions.\nThere was no reason for the city to warn anyone of a simple operation of this kind. What kind of warning could be given? Should it be a warning that a hydrant is going to be opened to flush a sewer and that it may stir up some rust and sediment? It had not done this on the previous two days. Over what area should such a notice be given? This hydrant was 1,250 feet away from this particular consumer. To impose on the city the duty of notice in circumstances such as these is to require a standard of perfection. Hydrants have to be opened repeatedly not only for this purpose but for street cleaning purposes and, in emergencies, for fire purposes. There is no evidence that the hydrant was opened in a careless manner. On the contrary, the evidence is that the hydrant was open to a thirty pounds pressure which would deliver no more water than the plaintiff itself was consuming in its own operation.\nEven if it were foreseeable that the use of the hydrant would result in the delivery to some consumers of turbid water, this in itself amounts to nothing. Everybody is familiar with turbid water and knows what to do with it. Although the waterworks officials, had they thought of the matter, might have concluded that there must be people in the city engaged in the processing of films, the city should not have to pay damages because a routine operation results in the delivery of turbid water to a film processing plant. I have not the slightest doubt that the city employee, in going about his work, never thought about the effect of opening the hydrant upon water consumers of peculiar sensitivity. In my opinion, it is not negligence to fail to turn one's mind to this problem. It would be impossible to do anything with a waterworks system if the city had to consider these minutiae, in relation to routine operations. Those who have particular requirements, and in this case it was a particular requirement over and above water of ordinary standards, must deal with the problem as part of their ordinary operating procedure. It was not negligence to fail to clean out the sediment and rust in the pipes. It was not shown that Vancouver had more of this than any other municipality. It was admitted that at certain times of the year there was apt to be more sediment in the water than at other times. It was also shown that there was more sediment in the water before a certain dam was constructed in the area where the water is collected. This dam acted as a settling basin. But the presence of sediment and rust in cast iron pipes is an everyday matter in the operation of a waterworks system and to say that the city must periodically flush the pipes to remove the sediment and rust so that this particular kind of consumer will not be affected is again to impose too high a duty on a municipal waterworks system.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Ladner, Downs, Ladner, Locke, Clark & Lenox, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent: B.

The Court of Appeal set aside this judgment and directed a new trial limited to the ascertainment of the plaintiff\u2019s damages. It was held that the findings of the jury as to the commission of adultery ought not to be disturbed but that there had been non\u2011direction as to certain matters which the jury should have been told to consider in mitigation of damages and that there had been misdirection which may well have resulted in a duplication in the two sums awarded by the jury. The plaintiff appealed to this Court asking that the judgment at trial be restored. The defendant\u2019s cross-appeal raised two propositions, (i) that in Ontario there is no separate cause of action for alienation of affections although alienation of a wife\u2019s affection if established may be an element in the assessment of the husband\u2019s damages in an action for criminal conversation or for enticement, and (ii) that in any event there was, in the case at bar, no evidence to support any assessment of damages for alienation separate from those for criminal conversation. Counsel for both parties requested this Court to assess the damages instead of directing a new trial.\nHeld: The order of the Court of Appeal should be varied; in lieu of the direction of a new assessment of damages it should be directed that judgment be entered in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant for $5,000 and the costs of the action.\nUnder s. 1 of The Property and Civil Rights Act, now R.S.O. 1960, c. 310, it is provided that in all matters of controversy relative to property and civil rights resort shall be had to the laws of England as they stood on the 15th day of October 1792 except so far as they have been altered by legislation having the force of law in Ontario. It was not suggested that there was any legislation in force in Ontario bearing upon the matter raised in the defendant\u2019s submission that in Ontario there is no separate cause of action for alienation of affections.\nThe action for damages for criminal conversation and the action for damages for enticement were introduced into Ontario as part of the common law of England. There was in 1792 no case in the books and no case has since that date been decided in England holding that a husband is entitled to damages on proof of the fact that he has lost the affection of his wife by reason of the conduct of the defendant unless that conduct was such as would support an action for criminal conversation or an action for enticement or was itself tortious.\nHence, there is no separate cause of action for \u201calienation of affections\u201d known to the law of Ontario. Winsmore v. Greenbank (1745), Willes 577, distinguished; Bannister v. Thompson (1913), 29 O.L.R. 562, (1914), 32 O.L.R. 34, not followed; Lellis v. Lambert (1897), 24 O.A.R. 653, approved.\nIn the case at bar on the findings of the jury the plaintiff had established his cause of action for damages for criminal conversation; he did not have a separate cause of action for alienation of his wife\u2019s affections but such alienation in so far as it had been established was the result of the criminal conversation and was one of the matters to be taken into consideration in assessing the damages.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], setting aside a judgment of Treleaven J. and ordering a new trial as to damages in an action for criminal conversation and alienation of affections. Order of the Court of Appeal varied.\nE.A. Goodman, Q.C., G.J. Karry, Q.C., and L.H. Schipper, for the plaintiff, appellant. M. Lerner, Q.C., and E. Cherniak, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, setting aside a judgment of Treleaven J. in favour of the plaintiff for $10,000 and directing a new trial limited to the ascertainment of the plaintiff\u2019s damages.\nThe action was brought for damages for criminal conversation and alienation of affections.\nThe appellant asks that the judgment at the trial be restored with costs throughout.\nWhile the respondent did not serve a notice of cross-appeal or a notice, pursuant to Rule 100, asking that the decision of the Court of Appeal should be varied, he is described in his factum as \u201cRespondent and Cross-Appellant\u201d and the factum contains an elaborate argument in support of two propositions, (i) that in Ontario there is no separate cause of action for alienation of affections although alienation of a wife\u2019s affection if established may be an element in the assessment of the husband\u2019s damages in an action for criminal conversation or for enticement, and (ii) that in any event there was, in the case at bar, no evidence to support any assessment of damages for alienation separate from those for criminal conversation. The factum concludes with the submission that:\nthe cross-appeal be allowed, and one of the following dispositions be made:\n(a) The claims for alienation of affections be dismissed and the matter be remitted for a new trial limited to damages for criminal conversation;\n(b) The claim for alienation of affections be dismissed and the damages for criminal conversation be assessed by this Court;\n(c) That there be one assessment of damages for criminal conversation and alienation of affections, either in a new trial or by this Court.\nAt the opening of the argument counsel for the appellant submitted that the respondent ought not to be allowed to raise the matters set out in his factum as recited above because (i) they had not been raised in the courts below and (ii) no notice of intention had been given. The Court was of opinion that we should hear counsel for the respondent on these matters and asked counsel for the appellant whether in view of this he wished an adjournment of the hearing as contemplated by Rule 100. Counsel replied that he was ready to proceed and filed a supplementary factum dealing with the points raised in the cross-appeal.\nThe action was commenced on September 12, 1957.\nIn the statement of claim it is alleged that during a period of approximately four months before August 1954 the defendant resolved to alienate the affection of the plaintiff\u2019s wife, that he succeeded in doing so, that he committed adultery with her \u201cthereby destroying the plaintiff\u2019s home and marriage and causing the plaintiff to lose the enjoyment of the society, affection, comfort and services of his said wife\u201d, that as a result of the adultery the plaintiff\u2019s wife gave birth to a female child of which the defendant was the father. The statement of claim continues:\n7. As a result of the Defendant\u2019s conduct aforesaid, the Plaintiff suffered a severe blow to and an invasion of his honour and great laceration to his feelings owing to the successful attack by the Defendant upon the Plaintiff\u2019s exclusive right to intercourse with the Plaintiff\u2019s wife.\n8. As a result of the Defendant\u2019s conduct aforesaid, the Plaintiff\u2019s family life has been very greatly damaged and has caused an estrangement between the Plaintiff and his wife, as well as a confusion in his household over the birth and future welfare of the said child.\n9. The Plaintiff states that he has suffered serious loss and will continue to suffer further loss.\nThe Plaintiff, therefore, claims:\n(a) Damages for criminal conversation in the sum of $25,000;\n(b) Damages for alienation of affections in the sum of $25,000;\n(c) Loss of earnings of the Plaintiff\u2019s wife in the sum of $557;\n(d) Medical expenses in the sum of $157;\n(e) Past and future maintenance of the said child born to the Plaintiff\u2019s wife and the Defendant in the sum of $25,000;\n(f) His costs of this action;\n(g) Such further and other relief as to this Honourable Court may seem just.\nBy the statement of defence all the material allegations in the statement of claim were denied and the defendant pleaded that if any estrangement had been caused between the plaintiff and his wife it had been caused not by any conduct of the defendant but by the plaintiff\u2019s own conduct.\nThe trial took place on October 14 and 15, 1959. The questions put to the jury and their answers were as follows:\nQ. 1. Was there any adultery committed between the Defendant and the Plaintiff\u2019s wife? Answer. Yes. Q. 2. If your answer is \u201cyes\u201d, when and where was the adultery committed?\nAnswer. July 1954 to November 1956 at his house and her house.\nQ. 3. If your answer is \u201cyes\u201d, at what amount do you assess the damages for adultery? Answer. $2,000.\nQ. 4. Did the Defendant alienate the affections of the Plaintiff\u2019s wife?\nAnswer. Yes.\nQ. 5. If your answer to question No. 4 is \u201cyes\u201d, at what amount do you assess the damages for such alienation?\nAnswer. $8,000.\nOn these answers judgment was entered for $10,000 and costs.\nThe defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal on the grounds, inter alia, that the damages were excessive and that there was non-direction and misdirection on the part of the learned trial judge.\nIn the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered by Schroeder J.A. it was held that there was evidence to support the findings made by the jury in answering questions one, two and four and that these findings should not be disturbed, but that there had been non\u2011direction as to certain matters which the jury should have been told to consider in mitigation of damages and that there had been misdirection which may well have resulted in a duplication in the two sums awarded by the jury. A new trial limited to the assessment of damages was accordingly directed. The decision of the Court of Appeal that the findings of the jury as to the commission of adultery ought not to be disturbed was not questioned before us.\nAt the conclusion of the argument of counsel for the appellant the Court stated that we were all of opinion that the Court of Appeal was right in directing a new trial and that we would hear counsel for the respondent on the matters raised in his factum by way of cross-appeal.\nMr. Cherniak presented a carefully prepared argument in support of the submission that in Ontario there is no separate cause of action for alienation of affections; Mr, Goodman in reply contended the contrary but also submitted that in the case at bar the question has little, if any, importance as the finding of adultery is not now questioned and the plaintiff is entitled to urge the loss of his wife\u2019s affection as one of the matters to be considered in assessing his damages for criminal conversation.\nAt the conclusion of the reply counsel for both parties joined in requesting that this Court assess the plaintiff\u2019s damages instead of sending the matter back for another trial and in our opinion it is in the best interest of the parties that we should take this course.\nWhile it may be that in the case at bar we could fix the plaintiff\u2019s damages without dealing with the point argued by Mr. Cherniak I think it better that we should decide that question, for, strictly speaking, if there are two separate causes of action we ought, I suppose, to make a separate assessment on each; and the matter is one of general importance.\nI have reached the conclusion that Mr. Cherniak\u2019s argument is sound and that there is no separate cause of action for \u201calienation of affections\u201d known to the law of Ontario.\nUnder s. 1 of The Property and Civil Rights Act, now R.S.O. 1960, c. 310, it is provided that in all matters of controversy relative to property and civil rights resort shall be had to the laws of England as they stood on the 15th day of October 1792 except so far as they have been altered by legislation having the force of law in Ontario. It is not suggested that there is any legislation in force in Ontario bearing upon the matter.\nIn 1792, the action for damages for criminal conversation and the action for damages for enticement were well known and both were introduced into Ontario as part of the common law of England. In my opinion, there was in 1792 no case in the books and no case has since that date been decided in England holding that a husband is entitled to damages on proof of the fact that he has lost the affection of his wife by reason of the conduct of the defendant unless that conduct was such as would support an action for criminal conversation or an action for enticement or was itself tortious as, for example, if the defendant\u2019s conduct which resulted in the plaintiff\u2019s loss of his wife\u2019s affection was the publication of a libel concerning the plaintiff. The present position of the law in England on this point is, I think, accurately stated in Lush on Husband and Wife, 4th ed., 1933, at p. 35 as follows:\nThis action of enticement lay against anyone, male or female, friend or relative, who unlawfully induced the wife to leave her husband, or unlawfully harbours her after she has left him.\nAdultery was irrelevant to the action, the husband\u2019s appropriate remedy therefor was the action technically laid in trespass, but in, substance one upon the case for criminal conversation, now abolished, but replaced by a petition against the alleged adulterer for damages brought in the Divorce Division.\nMoreover, the action is not one for alienation of affections; an action on such ground is unknown to the law of England, would be new in principle and not merely in instance, and would therefore not lie, unless such a right of action were expressly created by statute.\nThere are, however, a number of cases in Ontario, some of them judgments of the Court of Appeal, in which, while the above quotation is recognized as a correct statement of the law in England, the assertion is made that the right of action for alienation of affections does exist in Ontario. On examination, it appears that in all of these cases the assertion mentioned is derived directly or mediately from Bannister v. Thompson[2]. Bannister v. Thompson was tried before Middleton J. and a jury. It is stated in the reasons of Middleton J. that the defendant had acquired a malign influence over the wife of the plaintiff, that his conduct was such that to the learned judge the inference that he was guilty of adultery appeared almost irresistible (although he dealt with the case on the basis that no adultery had been proved, as the jury had failed to find it), that the misconduct of the defendant had resulted in the total alienation of the affection of the wife and the wrecking of the plaintiffs home, that the wife while continuing to live under her husband\u2019s roof had entirely ceased to discharge any wifely function, slept in her own room locking the door, refused to speak to her husband, and the husband was as fully deprived of her consortium as if she lived in a separate building.\nMiddleton J. submitted two questions to the jury and instructed the jury to assess damages \u201cseparately upon each count\u201d if they found for the plaintiff. The questions were put in the precise words of the plaintiff\u2019s claim and the jury found that the defendant, (i) \u201centiced away from the plaintiff his wife, Annie Bannister, and procured her to absent herself unlawfully without his consent for long intervals from the house and society of the plaintiff\u201d, and (ii) \u201cby his wrongful acts has alienated from the plaintiff the affections of his wife, Annie Bannister, and deprived the plaintiff of the love, services, and society of his wife, thus destroying the peace and happiness of his household\u201d.\nThe jury assessed the damages at $500 on the first head and $1,000 on the second.\nFor the defendant it was argued that on these findings the plaintiff was not entitled to judgment. The learned judge stated that the considerations applicable to each of the counts differed and that they must be treated separately.\nDealing first with enticement Middleton J. said, at p. 564:\nThe wife, while living under her husband\u2019s roof, had entirely ceased to discharge any wifely function. She slept in her own room, locking the door. She refused to speak to her husband; and he was as fully deprived of her consortium as if she lived in a separate building.\nIt is said that this constitutes no cause of action, because the defendant himself has not actually received her to his own house. I do not think that this is so. It is not the fact that the woman is staying with her paramour that constitutes the wrong; it is depriving the plaintiff of the wife\u2019s consortium, which, under the circumstances, is just as full and complete as if the woman had been forcibly abducted.\nIn my opinion this is a correct statement of the law. The ingredients of the cause of action for enticement are stated in the reasons of the Lords Justices in Place v. Searle[3], particularly by Greer L.J. at p. 517, and are accurately summarized in the head-note to the report as follows:\nA wife owes the duty to her husband to reside and consort with him, and any one who, without justification, procures, entices or persuades her to violate this duty commits a wrong towards the husband for which he is entitled to recover damages.\nThe judgment in Bannister simply makes it clear that a wife may violate her duty to reside and consort with her husband although continuing to live under the same roof.\nTurning to the second branch of the case Middleton J. rejects the dictum of Osler J.A. in Lellis v. Lambert[4] (to be examined shortly), taking the view that it is obiter and continues, at pp. 565 and 566: I find myself quite unable to accept this statement of the law. I think the case of Winsmore v. Greenbank (1745), Willes 577, establishes otherwise, and that the law recognises the right of the husband to recover damages against a defendant for any misconduct which deprives the plaintiff of the love, services, and society of his wife\u2014to use the words of this pleading\u2014commonly called consortium. It may be that the two counts in this statement are really an alternative description of the same wrong, and that the view already expressed sufficiently shews the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover.\nI think this case illustrates the distinction between the action of enticement and the action of crim. con. To maintain the latter, proof of adultery is essential, and the action may be maintained even though there has been no consequent loss of the wife\u2019s affections, society, and services.\n* * *\nand at pp. 566 and 567:\nWinsmore v. Greenbank is not, so far as I can ascertain, doubted or qualified. It is everywhere cited as authority. It is there said, (p. 581): \u201cThere must be damnum cum injuri\u00e2; which I admit. I admit likewise the consequence, that the fact laid down before per quod consortium amisit is as much the gist of the action as the other; for though it should be laid that the plaintiff lost the comfort and assistance of his wife, yet if the fact that is laid by which he lost it be a lawful act, no action can be maintained. By injuria is meant a tortious act: it need not be wilful and malicious; for though it be accidental, if it be tortious, an action will lie. This rule therefore being admitted, the only question is whether any such injury be laid here,\u201d\nAn unlawful procuring, it is said, is shewn where the defendant persuades the wife with effect to do an unlawful act, this rendering it unlawful in the defendant; for \u201cevery moment that a wife continues absent from her husband it is a new tort, and every one who persuades her to do so does a new injury and cannot but know it to be so.\u201d The consequence of the unlawful act was said to be sufficiently laid when it was alleged that by means thereof the plaintiff \u201clost the comfort and society of his wife and her aid and assistance in his domestic affairs and the profit and advantage he would and ought to have had of and from her estates.\u201d\nAs Middleton J. says, Winsmore v. Greenbank is \u201ceverywhere cited as authority\u201d; but the cause of action, the injuria, recognized in that case was enticement; alienation of the wife\u2019s affections was only one of the items going to make up the total of the damages caused to the plaintiff.\nIt will be observed that, in the quotation from his reasons above, Middleton J. suggests that \u201cthe two counts\u2026are really an alternative description of the same wrong, and that the view already expressed (i.e., the view that the plaintiff had a cause of action for enticement) sufficiently shews the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover\u201d. With respect, I am of opinion that the correct statement would have been that the injuria which gave the plaintiff a cause of action was the enticement and that the alienation of the wife\u2019s affections which was one of the consequences of the enticement was part of the damnum resulting from that injuria.\nThis appears to me to be in accord with the view of the Court of Appeal whereby the appeal from the judgment at the trial was allowed in part and the damages were reduced to $1,000. Maclaren J.A. who gave the judgment of the Court said (at 32 O.L.R., pp. 36 and 37):\nThe appellant also urges that the two paragraphs above referred to overlap. The first alleges that the defendant enticed away from the plaintiff his wife and procured her to absent herself unlawfully for long intervals from his house and society; the second, that the defendant by his wrongful acts alienated from the plaintiff the affections of his wife and deprived him of her love, services, and society.\n* * *\nThe first paragraph refers rather to the means used, the second to the damages resulting therefrom. This is dealt with in the case of Winsmore v. Greenbank, supra, at p. 582, where, in answer to the objection that procuring, enticing, and persuading were not sufficient, if no ill consequences followed from them, it was held to be sufficient in that case because it was specifically alleged that the plaintiff had thereby lost the comfort and society of his wife, and the advantage of her fortune, etc.\nThe dictum of Osler J.A. in Lellis v. Lambert[5], referred to above, which was rejected by Middleton J. reads as follows:\nThe loss of a wife\u2019s affections not brought about by some act on the defendant\u2019s part which necessarily caused or involved the loss of her consortium, never gave a cause of action to the husband. His wife might permit an admirer to pay her attentions, frequent her society, visit at her home, spend his money upon her, and by such means alienate her affections from him, resulting even in her refusal to live with him, and, so far as she could bring it about, in the breaking up of his home, and yet, there being no adultery and no \u201cprocuring and enticing\u201d, or \u201charbouring and secreting\u201d of the wife, no action lay at the suit of the husband against the man.\nThere may be some difficulty in suggesting a case in which the conduct of a defendant which results directly in a wife\u2019s refusal to live with her husband would not amount to procuring and enticing her to leave her husband and result in a total loss of consortium; but in so far as Osler J.A. says that, where there is no adultery, no \u201cprocuring and enticing\u201d or \u201charbouring and secreting\u201d of a wife and no loss of her consortium, the mere fact that conduct of the defendant has caused the loss of a wife\u2019s affections does not give her husband a cause of action, it appears to me that he has stated the law correctly.\nI do not propose to refer in detail to the decisions in Ontario cited by counsel in which it has been asserted that the fact of alienation of a wife\u2019s affections caused by the defendant gives a separate cause of action to the wife\u2019s husband. I have examined all of them. I am satisfied that in each the ground of the assertion can be traced to the judgments in Bannister v. Thompson and Winsmore v. Greenbank, and for the reasons I have given above it is my opinion that in so far as they do make the assertion they ought not to be followed.\nI have reached the conclusion that in the case at bar on the findings of the jury the plaintiff has established his cause of action for damages for criminal conversation, that he has not a separate cause of action for alienation of his wife\u2019s affections but that such alienation in so far as it has been established is the result of the criminal conversation and is one of the matters to be taken into consideration in assessing the damages.\nIt remains to assess the damages. The facts are unusual; they are stated in the reasons of Schroeder J.A. and it is not necessary to set them out in great detail.\nThe appellant and his wife, Anna Kungl, were married in Hungary on April 27, 1937. Three children, Mary Kungl, born on July 15, 1938, Theresa Kungl, born on May 28, 1940, and Joseph Kungl, born on April 29, 1942, were born in Hungary.\nThe respondent was married to the appellant\u2019s sister and in 1952 he brought the appellant and his family to Canada. The cost of moving was borne by the respondent. The appellant and his family moved into the respondent\u2019s home. There was a friendly relationship between the appellant and the respondent and their families. In 1953 the appellant and his family moved out of the respondent\u2019s house into their own living quarters in the nearby town of Leamington, Ontario.\nThe respondent\u2019s wife became ill and for six weeks prior to her death on April 15, 1954, the appellant\u2019s wife stayed with her day and night and nursed her. About three weeks after his wife\u2019s death the respondent requested Mrs. Kungl to come to work for him by the day as a housekeeper and she did so until 1955. During this time the respondent transported her to and from his home each day. Mrs. Kungl stated that on the first day on which she attended at the respondent\u2019s home to do the housecleaning the respondent made improper advances to her and offered her $100 to submit to him but she refused, that for several weeks thereafter the advances continued, that she finally yielded and from about August 1954 to October 1956 the respondent regularly had sexual intercourse with her and professed his love for her.\nOn January 9, 1957, Mrs. Kungl gave birth to a daughter, Rosann, of whom she stated that the respondent is the father. The learned trial judge instructed the jury as a matter of law that this daughter must be presumed to be the child of the appellant and this direction was not attacked in argument.\nIn the month of June 1957, the appellant\u2019s wife stated to her husband that the respondent was the father of the child Rosann.\nUp to this time the appellant and his wife were living together as man and wife and having normal sexual relations with each other and in spite of the wife\u2019s statement as to the paternity of Rosann they continued to do so thereafter.\nThere is no suggestion in the evidence that at any time after the birth of Rosann the respondent had any improper relations with the appellant\u2019s wife or made any attempt to entice her or indeed to have anything to do with her.\nAfter his wife\u2019s statement as to the paternity of Rosann the appellant and his wife sold the house which they jointly owned and bought another the title to which was taken in their joint names. Commencing with the summer of 1958 there were intermittent separations between the appellant and his wife but they were still living together in September 1959. They separated again a few weeks before the trial of the action. In reply to a question put by the learned trial judge as to whether she was willing to stay with her husband, Mrs. Kungl said \u201cYes, I would have stayed but my husband couldn\u2019t stand me.\u201d There was evidence that the family life of the appellant and his wife had been a reasonably happy one but that it became less happy following her disclosure of her relationship with the respondent.\nThree witnesses called by the defence gave evidence which, if accepted, established, in the words of Schroeder J.A., \u201cthat the plaintiff\u2019s wife had on several occasions engaged in the most vulgar sort of familiarity with friends or acquaintances of her husband\u201d. Mrs. Kungl was not called as a witness in reply to deny the evidence of these witnesses.\nIt is not necessary to restate the general principles by which the Court is guided in assessing damages for adultery. They are accurately set out in the reasons of McCardie J. in Butterworth v. Butterworth & Englefield[6]. In a case of this sort there is no method of calculation by which a figure can be reached with any exactitude. Our task is to endeavour to approach the matter as would a properly instructed jury, bearing in mind the general principles referred to above and the circumstances which Schroeder J.A. points out ought in this case to be considered as matters of mitigation, and to estimate the figure which appears proper on the particular facts of this case. We have reached the conclusion that the damages should be fixed at $5,000.\nBut for the fact that counsel for both parties asked us to assess the damages, the appeal to this Court would have been dismissed and the respondent is entitled to his costs of the appeal. I would make no order as to costs of the cross-appeal. The respondent is entitled to his costs in the Court of Appeal but the appellant is entitled to the costs of the trial.\nIn the result the order of the Court of Appeal should be varied; in lieu of the direction for a new assessment of damages it should be directed that judgment be entered in favour of the appellant against the respondent for $5,000 and the costs of the action. The respondent should recover from the appellant his costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal and of the appeal to this Court. Order of Court of Appeal varied. Judgment to be entered in favour of appellant for $5,000 and costs of the action. Respondent entitled to his costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal and of the appeal to this Court.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: George J.

Mis-En-Cause.\n1961: November 6; 1962: January 23.\nPresent: Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nReal property\u2014Lien\u2014Unpaid balance on repair work\u2014Bankruptcy of debtor\u2014Trust deed\u2014Possession of property by trustee\u2014Whether trust deed prevents lien from taking effect\u2014Civil Code, arts. 1981, 2081.\nHaving executed repairs to buildings belonging to L Co., the plaintiff registered in April 1955, a builder privilege on these buildings. In September 1955 it instituted this action against L Co. for debt and for a declaration that the privilege was valid. Neither L Co., who was in bankruptcy at the time, nor the trustee in bankruptcy defended the action. However, the appellant trust company intervened, invoked a trust deed, dated February 1948, stipulating that on default the trust company had a right to be put in possession of these buildings and to administer or sell them, and pleaded that the privilege was invalid since the ownership of L Co. had become conditional or precarious by virtue of the trust deed. By a judgment, dated June 1955, the trust company had been put in possession of the assets of L Co. The trust company's claim was dismissed by the trial judge, and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. The trust company appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. The trust company's claim that the trust deed had rendered the privilege null could not be supported. The trust deed was a contract of warranty and not of alienation, a loan and not a transfer of ownership. The rights given to the trust company by the trust deed did not have the effect of making the ownership of L Co. conditional or precarious. The privilege claimed by the plaintiff was not extinguished by virtue of art. 2081 of the Civil Code, since L Co. was owner at the time the repairs were effected. The trust company's claim was incompatible with the provisions of art. 1981 of the Code, which declares that the property of the debtor is the common pledge of his creditors.\nThe covenant in the trust deed by which L Co. assumed the obligation to keep his property clear of liens could not bind a third party.\nLalibert\u00e9 et al. v. Larue, Trudel et Picher et al., [1931] S.C.R. 7, applied; Vachon v. Desch\u00eanes, 59 Que.

Appeal dismissed.\nErnest Lafontaine, for the intervenant, appellant.\nJean-Louis Dorais, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014La compagnie Roland Chalifoux Limit\u00e9e a, du 8 septembre 1953 au 9 avril 1955, effectu\u00e9 des travaux de r\u00e9fection sur des immeubles appartenant \u00e0 Laval Transport Inc. au co\u00fbt de $30,560.08 dont $17,585.08 demeura non pay\u00e9. Le 22 avril 1955, elle fit enregistrer sur ces immeubles un privil\u00e8ge d'entrepreneur pour le solde ci-dessus, donnant, le m\u00eame jour, avis de cet enregistrement \u00e0 la compagnie d\u00e9bitrice. Le 25 septembre suivant, elle poursuivait cette derni\u00e8re demandant, en outre d'une condamnation personnelle pour la dette, la reconnaissance de la validit\u00e9 de son privil\u00e8ge et adoptant les conclusions usuelles pour en assurer la pleine r\u00e9alisation.\nAu moment de l'institution de cette action, la d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e9tait en faillite. Ni le failli, ni le syndic ne contest\u00e8rent.\nL'appelante, d'autre part, produisit une intervention. Elle invoqua un acte de fiducie sign\u00e9 le 27 f\u00e9vrier 1948 par Laval Transport Inc. pour garantir une \u00e9mission d'obligations de celle-ci; sa qualit\u00e9 de fiduciaire; le d\u00e9faut de la d\u00e9bitrice de satisfaire aux obligations par elle assum\u00e9es en cet acte de fiducie; un jugement du 28 juin 1955 de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure la mettant en possession de l'actif de la d\u00e9bitrice, ainsi que pourvu \u00e0 l'acte de fiducie dans le cas de d\u00e9faut. Elle all\u00e9gua de plus que la d\u00e9fenderesse n'avait jamais autoris\u00e9 les travaux en question; que ceux-ci avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 entrepris en paiement d'une dette de reconnaissance; que l'enregistrement de ce privil\u00e8ge \u00e9tait tardif aussi bien que le fruit d'une arri\u00e8re-pens\u00e9e n\u00e9e \u00e0 la suite de la requ\u00eate en faillite. Concluant sur cette intervention, l'intim\u00e9e demanda \u00e0 ce que ce privil\u00e8ge soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ill\u00e9gal, nul et radi\u00e9, et qu'ordre soit donn\u00e9 au mis-en-cause, le R\u00e9gistrateur de la Division d'enregistrement concern\u00e9e, d'en effectuer la radiation.\nLa Cour sup\u00e9rieure rejeta cette intervention et accueillit la demande de l'entrepreneur.\nPort\u00e9 en appel, ce jugement fut confirm\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision unanime de la Cour du banc de la reine2. D'o\u00f9 le pourvoi de l'intervenante \u00e0 cette Cour.\nIl n'y a, \u00e0 vrai dire, qu'une seule question \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer, savoir si, telle que formul\u00e9e par l'appelante en son factum et \u00e0 l'audition, l'acte de fiducie constitue une fin de non-recevoir du privil\u00e8ge de l'intim\u00e9e m\u00eame si, par ailleurs, ce privil\u00e8ge est valide nonobstant les autres moyens plaid\u00e9s par l'appelante. En effet, si l'appelante n'a pas formellement abandonn\u00e9 ces autres moyens, la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour d'Appel les ont \u00e9cart\u00e9s comme mal fond\u00e9s et l'appelante n'a aucunement tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer que cette conclusion des deux Cours sur les faits \u00e9tait erron\u00e9e.\nC'est, en substance, la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelante que le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Laval Transport Inc. sur les immeubles hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s par celle-ci en sa faveur est devenu conditionnel ou pr\u00e9caire par suite de ces dispositions de l'acte de fiducie pr\u00e9voyant que sur d\u00e9faut de la d\u00e9bitrice de se conformer \u00e0 ses obligations, l'appelante avait droit, aux fins d'obtenir satisfaction de sa cr\u00e9ance, d'\u00eatre mise en possession de ces immeubles, les g\u00e9rer ou en disposer de gr\u00e9 \u00e0 gr\u00e9 ou par vente en justice.\nAu soutien de cette pr\u00e9tention, l'appelante a invoqu\u00e9 le para. 2 de l'art. 2081 C.C., la d\u00e9cision de la Cour du banc de la reine dans Vachon v. Desch\u00eanes3, et d'autres causes dans lesquelles, suivant elle, le m\u00eame principe aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu. Les parties pertinentes de l'art. 2081 C.C. se lisent comme il suit:\n2081. Les hypoth\u00e8ques et privil\u00e8ges s'\u00e9teignent:\n1. ....................................................................................................................\n2. Par la r\u00e9solution ou par l'extinction l\u00e9gale du droit conditionnel ou pr\u00e9caire dans la personne qui a donn\u00e9 lieu au privil\u00e8ge ou \u00e0 l'hypoth\u00e8que.\n3. ....................................................................................................................\nCette disposition est une application de l'art. 2038 C.C., aux termes duquel ceux qui n'ont sur un immeuble qu'un droit suspendu par une condition ou r\u00e9soluble dans certains cas, ou sujet \u00e0 r\u00e9cision, ne peuvent consentir qu'une hypoth\u00e8que soumise aux m\u00eames conditions ou \u00e0 la m\u00eame r\u00e9cision. Migneault, Droit Civil Canadien, vol. 9, p. 180. Que ces dispositions de l'art. 2081 C.C. puissent trouver une application et entra\u00eener l'extinction d'un privil\u00e8ge d'entrepreneur dans les cas o\u00f9, comme dans Vachon v. Desch\u00eanes, supra, se trouve une clause de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 permettant au vendeur de reprendre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue sans obligation de rembourser aucun des deniers d\u00e9bours\u00e9s, ni paiement fait en rapport avec la vente, ni le co\u00fbt des am\u00e9liorations, le tout devant \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de loyer et dommages liquid\u00e9s, il ne s'ensuit pas qu'elles doivent s'appliquer en l'esp\u00e8ce. L'acte de fiducie ne contient aucune disposition de la nature de celles apparaissant \u00e0 la convention examin\u00e9e dans Vachon v. Desch\u00eanes, supra, ou aux conventions invoqu\u00e9es dans les autres causes cit\u00e9es par l'appelante.\nDans Lalibert\u00e9 et al. v. Larue, Trudel et Picher et Les Appartements Lafontaine Limit\u00e9e4, on consid\u00e9ra un acte de fiducie comportant des clauses substantiellement semblables \u00e0 celles apparaissant \u00e0 l'acte de fiducie produit en la pr\u00e9sente cause et sur lesquelles l'appelante veut appuyer ses pr\u00e9tentions.\nOn jugea que cet acte ne conf\u00e9rait au fiduciaire que le droit d'un cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire ou gagiste et non ceux d'un propri\u00e9taire; que le sens de l'acte, tant dans son texte que dans son esprit, \u00e9tait celui du contrat hypoth\u00e9caire et de nantissement; que le titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait demeur\u00e9 entre les mains de l'oblig\u00e9e puisque sur paiement des obligations par elle assum\u00e9es, le fiduciaire n'avait pas \u00e0 lui signer une r\u00e9trocession mais qu'\u00e0 lui donner une quittance finale et mainlev\u00e9e des hypoth\u00e8ques. On en a conclu que les biens hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s faisaient partie des biens de la compagnie d\u00e9bitrice et que, par suite de la faillite, ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9volus au syndic et non aux obligataires.\nJe suis clairement d'avis que l'acte de fiducie en la pr\u00e9sente cause est \u00e9galement un contrat de garantie et non d'ali\u00e9nation, un emprunt et non un transfert de propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Le droit de l'appelante, comme cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re hypoth\u00e9caire, comme d'ailleurs celui de l'intim\u00e9e, comme cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e, de poursuivre la r\u00e9alisation de leurs cr\u00e9ances respectives sur les immeubles affect\u00e9s n'a pas pour effet de rendre conditionnel ou pr\u00e9caire le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Laval Transport Inc. sur ces immeubles. A la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelante est fondamentalement incompatible avec les dispositions de l'art. 1981 C.C. prescrivant que:\nLes biens du d\u00e9biteur sont le gage commun de ses cr\u00e9anciers et, dans le cas de concours, le prix s'en distribue par contribution, \u00e0 moins qu'il n'y ait entre eux des causes l\u00e9gitimes de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\nL'appelante a \u00e9galement invoqu\u00e9 cette clause de l'acte de fiducie o\u00f9 Laval Transport Inc. assuma l'obligation:\nDe d\u00e9fendre, s'il y a lieu, ses titres aux biens ci-dessus d\u00e9sign\u00e9s et particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 ceux sp\u00e9cifiquement hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s, qu'elle d\u00e9clare et garantit \u00eatre bons, et de tenir les dits biens libres et clairs de tous privil\u00e8ges, charges et hypoth\u00e8ques, qui pourraient avoir priorit\u00e9 sur les garanties cr\u00e9\u00e9es par le pr\u00e9sent acte ou avoir rang \u00e9gal avec ces garanties.\nCette stipulation, dit l'appelante, invalide le privil\u00e8ge de l'intim\u00e9e. Il ne s'agit l\u00e0, \u00e0 mon avis, que d'une obligation purement personnelle assum\u00e9e par la d\u00e9bitrice \u00e0 l'endroit du fiduciaire. L'inobservation de cette obligation constitue sans doute un d\u00e9faut donnant ouverture aux droits conf\u00e9r\u00e9s au fiduciaire au cas de d\u00e9faut, mais est ineffective pour emp\u00eacher un entrepreneur \u00e9tranger \u00e0 cette convention d'acqu\u00e9rir valablement un privil\u00e8ge qui lui r\u00e9sulte de la loi. 1983 C.C.\nPour ces raisons, je dirais que c'est \u00e0 bon droit qu'on a rejet\u00e9 la demande de l'appelante de d\u00e9clarer ill\u00e9gal, nul et radi\u00e9 le privil\u00e8ge enregistr\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e et d'ordonner au R\u00e9gistrateur de la Division d'enregistrement concern\u00e9e d'en effectuer la radiation.

The snowplow was travelling on the left side of the road and the accident happened on a curve. The trial judge came to the conclusion that the accident was caused, at least in part, by the fault of the operator of the snowplow, and maintained the action. The Court of Queen's Bench, by a majority decision, dismissed the action. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe dangerous situation was created by the presence of the snowplow on the wrong side of the road. The driver of the car was on a road which curved to his right. The snow banks on the side of the road varied from 4 to 7 feet in height. Drifting snow reduced visibility to 150 feet for the driver of the car. It might be true that the driver of the snowplow could see at a distance of 400 feet, but that was because he was seated high in his cab.\nBy driving his snowplow on the left side of the road without any valid reason and in full knowledge of the danger he was creating, the driver of the snowplow did not exercise the standard of care which a reasonable prudent man would have exercised in the circumstances. Assuming that the driver of the car had failed to keep a proper lookout, the character of his fault was not abnormal and unforeseeable in relation to the danger caused by the driver of the snowplow. In this hypothesis the liability would be divided between the two drivers, so that there was at least contributory negligence on the part of the driver of the snowplow. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Desmarais J. Appeal allowed.\n\u0395 vender Veilleux, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.\nLaurent E. Belanger, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014Dans la nuit du 19 au 20 f\u00e9vrier 1959, vers minuit, l'appelante, passag\u00e8re dans une automobile conduite par Ren\u00e9 Couture, sur la route n\u00b0 1, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, fut gri\u00e8vement bless\u00e9e lorsque, dans une courbe entre Garth Bay et St-G\u00e9rard, ce v\u00e9hicule, proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 droite de la route, est entr\u00e9 en collision avec un camion chasse-neige venant en sens oppos\u00e9 et conduit par le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e, Lorenzo Audit, \u00e0 sa gauche et non \u00e0 sa droite.\nDans une action en dommages intent\u00e9e par la victime \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, le Juge de premi\u00e8re instance consid\u00e9ra que le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de cette derni\u00e8re n'avait en l'occurrence aucune raison valable de circuler sur la route \u00e0 sa gauche pour y enlever la neige; qu'en ce faisant, dans une courbe o\u00f9 la visibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait presque nulle, il avait cr\u00e9\u00e9 une situation inusit\u00e9e, impr\u00e9visible et rendant p\u00e9rilleuse la circulation des v\u00e9hicules venant \u00e0 sa rencontre; que la prudence exigeait alors qu'il pr\u00eet au moins les pr\u00e9cautions n\u00e9cessaires pour pr\u00e9venir suffisamment \u00e0 l'avance les usagers de la route, venant en sens oppos\u00e9, du danger, qu'il r\u00e9alisait d'ailleurs cr\u00e9er en conduisant ainsi ill\u00e9galement; que m\u00eame si on pouvait reprocher \u00e0 Couture d'avoir, en cette courbe, maintenu une vitesse trop grande, ou un manque de ma\u00eetrise de son v\u00e9hicule, cette collision ne serait pas survenue Audit n'e\u00fbt-il d'abord barr\u00e9 le chemin. La Cour en conclut que cet accident \u00e9tait attribuable, au moins en partie, \u00e0 la faute du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de la d\u00e9fenderesse et condamna celle-ci \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l'appelante la somme de $14,707.80.\nPort\u00e9 en appel par l'intim\u00e9e, ce jugement fut infirm\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire de la Cour du banc de la reine2. La question consid\u00e9r\u00e9e fut de savoir quelle \u00e9tait la cause directe de cet accident, la pr\u00e9sence du camion sur la gauche du chemin ou l'imprudence, n\u00e9gligence et manque d'attention de la part de Couture, ou les deux. MM. les Juges Badeaux et Hyde, de la majorit\u00e9, furent d'avis que le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e, qui, quelques secondes avant l'accident, avait constat\u00e9 la venue d'une automobile \u00e0 une distance d'environ 400 pieds, ne pouvait prendre d'autres pr\u00e9cautions que celles qu'il avait alors adopt\u00e9es par la mise \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat de son camion et par le signalement de sa pr\u00e9sence en allumant et \u00e9teignant \u00e0 quelques reprises les phares d'avant de son v\u00e9hicule; que si Couture avait \u00e9t\u00e9 attentif, il aurait pu voir le camion en temps utile, mod\u00e9rer sa vitesse et passer \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 sans incident. On jugea que les faits de cette cause ne pouvaient se distinguer de ceux qui avaient donn\u00e9 lieu aux d\u00e9cisions de la Cour du banc de la reine dans Trudel v. Broughton Soapstone Quarry Company Limited3 et Lauzier v. Asbestos Transport Limited4.\nDissident, M. le Juge Bissonnette rappela, en droit, les principes pos\u00e9s dans les causes ci-dessus et dans celle de Brisson v. Potvin5. En fait, cependant, il consid\u00e9ra que le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e avait, en l'esp\u00e8ce, commis une faute causale en rapport avec le fait dommageable. Peu importe, ajoute-t-il, que ce soit l\u00e0 ou non l'unique cause de l'accident; la passag\u00e8re de Couture n'ayant pas \u00e0 \u00e9tablir ni \u00e0 d\u00e9partager la responsabilit\u00e9 de chaque conducteur, la faute causale de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tant constat\u00e9e, son droit au recouvrement de ses dommages \u00e9tait d\u00e8s lors l\u00e9galement fond\u00e9.\nL'examen attentif et complet de tous les t\u00e9moignages, n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 par ces divergences de vues sur les faits, r\u00e9v\u00e8le ce qui suit. Au moment de l'accident, la nuit \u00e9tait claire et, au dire de t\u00e9moins d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9s, le pav\u00e9 \u00e9tait quelque peu glissant. La collision se produisit dans une courbe que Couture devait prendre en inclinant vers la droite. De ce c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la route, la pr\u00e9sence de bancs de neige variant en hauteur, suivant les t\u00e9moignages, de 4 \u00e0 7 pieds, et la neige soulev\u00e9e et pouss\u00e9e en tourbillons par le vent, r\u00e9duisaient consid\u00e9rablement la distance qui, sans ces circonstances, aurait permis \u00e0 Couture d'apercevoir, dans cette courbe, un v\u00e9hicule conduit, en sens oppos\u00e9, \u00e0 gauche de la route. Ceci, comme l'a signal\u00e9 M. le Juge Bissonnette, est amplement confirm\u00e9 par le fait que peu de temps apr\u00e8s la collision, Audette, le conducteur de l'ambulance transportant la victime \u00e0 l'h\u00f4pital, en suivant le m\u00eame parcours pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment effectu\u00e9 par Couture, \u00e9vita de justesse ce camion chasse-neige qu'il ne put apercevoir qu'\u00e0 une distance de 150 \u00e0 200 pieds. Il se peut que le conducteur du camion ait pu, lui, voir venir une automobile \u00e0 une distance de 400 pieds; le banc sur lequel il \u00e9tait assis pour conduire \u00e9tait, en hauteur, \u00e0 un niveau deux fois sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui du si\u00e8ge de l'automobile conduite par Couture. A la vitesse combin\u00e9e \u00e0 laquelle ces deux v\u00e9hicules approchaient l'un de l'autre avant l'imminence du danger, il est certain que lorsque Couture fut en position de pouvoir r\u00e9aliser la pr\u00e9sence du camion sur la trav\u00e9e o\u00f9 lui-m\u00eame proc\u00e9dait l\u00e9galement, il ne lui restait \u00e0 peine que quelques secondes pour r\u00e9agir, aviser et passer \u00e0 gauche du camion.\nLa faute du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e ne fait aucun doute. La conduite de son camion \u00e0 gauche du chemin, sans aucune raison valable et en pleine connaissance de la situation p\u00e9rilleuse qu'il cr\u00e9ait, ne correspond pas au standard de prudence qu'un homme raisonnablement prudent devait adopter dans les circonstances. La n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 ou l'urgence qu'il peut y avoir d'enlever la neige sur les grandes routes n'exclut pas l'obligation de ceux qui y sont pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de se conformer \u00e0 ce degr\u00e9 de prudence dont d\u00e9pend la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des usagers de la route et \u00e0 l'observation duquel il est l\u00e9gitime pour ceux-ci de s'attendre.\nAssumant que Couture ait commis cette faute d'inattention, que lui ont imput\u00e9e les Juges de la majorit\u00e9, le caract\u00e8re de cette faute n'\u00e9tait pas anormal et impr\u00e9visible par rapport au danger caus\u00e9 par le conducteur du camion. L'\u00e9tat de choses d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la faute premi\u00e8re de celui-ci comportait, \u00e0 sa connaissance d'ailleurs, une puissance dommageable propre que la faute subs\u00e9quente de Couture a d\u00e9clench\u00e9e. Dans cette hypoth\u00e8se, la responsabilit\u00e9 se partage entre les auteurs des deux fautes. Savatier, Trait\u00e9 de Responsabilit\u00e9 civile en droit fran\u00e7ais, tome 2, p. 40, n\u00b0 480. En somme, cette collision, normalement pr\u00e9visible par le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e, a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cons\u00e9quence logique de sa faute. En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour les Juges de la majorit\u00e9, je dirais donc que sa faute a \u00e9t\u00e9, pour le moins, contributive au fait dommageable.\nEn Cour d'Appel, l'intim\u00e9e a plaid\u00e9 que le montant des dommages accord\u00e9s \u00e9tait excessif. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle ils en sont arriv\u00e9s, les Juges de la majorit\u00e9 n'ont pas eu \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer la question. M. le Juge Bissonnette, d'autre part, a trouv\u00e9 que ce grief \u00e9tait sans fondement et, devant cette Cour, l'intim\u00e9e en a formellement fait l'abandon.\nDans ces vues, je maintiendrais l'appel et infirmerais le jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine, avec d\u00e9pens des deux Cours.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorney for the plaintiff, appellant: E.

They were jointly charged under s. 104(1) of the Criminal Code for offering to accept a sum of money to aid in procuring the passing of a measure, motion or resolution concerning the issue of a building permit. A second count of indictment contained a separate charge against L of accepting a sum of money for the same purpose. The evidence related to certain conversations by M, president of a company, and P, a building contractor, with the accused. The trial judge directed the jury to acquit on the ground that all preparations had been made for the issue of the permit before the alleged conversations had taken place, or before any money had been paid over to L. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial. The accused appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nIt is true that the permit was issued before the passing of the bylaw but on the evidence it was issued after the conversations had taken place and it was followed by the passing of the bylaw. Although there was no express mention in the evidence of the payment of money for the purpose of procuring a vote for the adoption of the bylaw, the jury was entitled to look at the evidence as a whole\u2014the preliminary conversations, the issue of the permit and the subsequent passing of the bylaw with the two accused voting for it. It was an error to isolate the vote from the issue of the permit and there was, in these circumstances, evidence to go to the jury on both counts.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, setting aside the verdict of acquittal and directing a new trial. Appeal dismissed.\nJoseph Sedgwick, Q.C., for the appellant Linden.\nE. Arthur Martin, Q.C., for the appellant Hall.\nW.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014In the year 1956 the two appellants were municipal officials of the Township of York, Frederick W. Hall being the reeve and Harold D. Linden one of the councillors. They were jointly indicted under s. 104(1) of the Criminal Code for offering to accept a sum of money from one Neil J. May to aid in procuring the adoption of a measure, motion or resolution concerning the issue of a building permit to him. The second count of the indictment contains a separate charge against Harold D. Linden of accepting from one Harry D. Payne a sum of money for the same purpose. At the conclusion of the case for the Crown, on the motion of counsel for the defence, the learned trial judge directed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty on both counts. The Court of Appeal held that there was error in so directing the jury, being unanimously of the opinion that there was some evidence fit for submission to the jury on both counts. The two accused now appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal setting aside the verdict of acquittal and directing a new trial.\nThe evidence on which the Court of Appeal acted is set out in full in its reasons. I do not propose to repeat more than the following brief summary.\nEarly in 1956 Neil J. May, the president and sole shareholder of Carbide Tool Company Limited, decided to extend his factory building in the Township of York. He first discussed a building permit with the Township Engineer and, on March 6, 1956, he completed the filing of the necessary documents for the issue of the permit. On March 8, he entered into a building contract with Harry D. Payne for the construction of the building.\nOn March 12, at a meeting of the Committee of General Purposes of the township, May\u2019s application for the permit was approved subject to a ten-foot set-back of the north wall of the proposed building from the neighbouring lands. On March 19, the next meeting of the Committee of General Purposes took place. In the meantime May secured the consent of the owners of the neighbouring lands to the erection of the building as shown on the original plans. At this meeting of the Committee the application was approved unanimously.\nThe general building by-law of the township provides as follows:\nS. 4 A permit shall be obtained from the Building Inspector by the owner or the legally authorized agent of the owner, for the erection, alterations, reconstruction, removal or wrecking of, or repairs to any (or part of any) building or structure.\nS. 84 (aa) Notwithstanding anything in this By-law contained, the Building Inspector shall not grant a permit for nor shall any person erect, construct or alter, a building or structure within the Township of York to be used for the purpose of a factory,\u2026unless and until the plans and specifications have been first submitted to and been approved by Council after a report thereon has been submitted to Council by the Building Inspector and by the Chief of the Fire Department.\nEvidence was given by the township solicitor that the usual practice was to issue a building permit without waiting for the passing of the by-law approving the minutes of the meeting of the Committee for General Purposes, and that the passing of the by-law authorizing the permit was regarded as a mere formality. The township engineer gave evidence to the same effect.\nOn March 20, 1956, May applied to the township office for his building permit and was told that it was not ready. On March 21, May had a meeting with Hall in the latter\u2019s office, having made the appointment by telephone the day before. May says that at this meeting Hall solicited a bribe and sent him on to see Linden, who also made the same suggestion. May also says that Linden called Hall in his presence and discussed the issue of the permit and stated that May understood what the position was. Following this conversation, May spoke to his lawyer before he returned to speak to Hall. On the second interview with Hall the township engineer was called in. He said that everything in connection with the permit was in order. After the engineer had left Hall referred to the arrangement which May had made with Linden and suggested that the money could be left in the glove compartment of his car. He pointed out where the car was parked. May also says that Hall, after a telephone conversation with the building department, told him that the permit was ready and to go down to the building department. May says that he did go down to the building department but the permit was not ready and that he was told to pick it up the following day. He did attend on the following day at the building inspector\u2019s department and the permit was delivered to him. May says that he did not give any money either to Linden or to Hall. He had already spoken to a solicitor and afterwards he and his solicitor interviewed the Assistant Crown Attorney.\nPayne says that he did give the sum of $100 to Linden for the issue of a permit.\nUp to this time, of course, the authorizing by-law had not been passed. There was nothing except the minute of the General Purposes Committee and what was referred to as the general practice to support the issue of the permit.\nThe grounds on which the learned trial judge directed the jury to acquit both accused were as follows:\nThe evidence clearly indicates that everything had been done as far as finalizing the preparation for the issuing of the building permit or the authorizing of the issuing of the building permit, before these alleged conversations took place with the two accused men, or before any money was paid over to Linden, as is alleged.\nSo it could not have been paid or could not have been promised for the purpose alleged against them, because the thing had already been done, it could not have been agreed to be paid or paid for the purpose of procuring the passage of a measure authorizing it.\nThe case for the prosecution is that it is open to the jury to infer from the evidence that the two appellants made an offer to accept money for assistance in obtaining a valid building permit and that this necessarily involved the passing of a by-law upon which each was entitled to vote and subsequently did in fact vote. I have outlined above the chronology of the evidence until the building by-law was passed. May, as an applicant, was in no position to demand of the building inspector that he issue a permit. It is true that the permit was issued before the passing of the by-law but on this evidence it was issued after the conversations between May and Hall and Linden and between Payne and Linden had taken place and it was followed by the passing of the by-law. Although there is no express mention in the evidence of the payment of money for the purpose of procuring a vote for the adoption of the by-law, the jury is entitled to look at the evidence as a whole\u2014the preliminary conversations, the issue of the permit and the subsequent passing of the by-law with the two accused voting for it. It was error to isolate the vote from the issue of the permit and there is, in these circumstances, evidence to go to the jury on both counts.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant Linden: J. Sedgwick, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the appellant Hall: G.A. Martin, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.C. Bowman, Toronto.\n",

The Queen, [1962] S.C.R. 469\nDate: 1962-03-26\nArthur James Kendall (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen (Defendant) Respondent.\n1962: March 14, 15, 26.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nCriminal law\u2014Capital murder\u2014Offence committed in 1952\u2014Prosecution in 1961\u2014Evidence of children now grown up supporting killing\u2014Body never recovered\u2014Whether jury properly instructed\u2014Jurisdiction of Appeal Court\u2014Criminal Code, s. 597A as enacted by 1960-61 (Can.), c. 44, s.11.\nThe accused was convicted in 1961 of the capital murder of his wife in 1952. The accused, in 1952, was a married man with five children then 12, 10, 8, 5 and 1\u00bd years old. He was convicted on the evidence of the three eldest children whose evidence indicated that their mother had been murdered by their father. The wife\u2019s body was never found. The evidence given by the children at the trial in 1961 differed materially from their stories as given in 1952. It was argued by the accused that the evidence was an unsafe foundation for the conviction. The Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction. The accused appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. The contradicting story given by the children in 1952 and their evidence given in 1961 raised a serious question of credibility, but this was clearly and adequately put to the jury on evidence that the children were under fear and intimidation in 1952. The jury was fully seized of this matter and there could be no attack on the judge\u2019s instruction on this ground.\nThe children who gave evidence in 1961 were testifying as people of mature intelligence to what they had observed as children. Questions of weight and credibility in these circumstances were entirely for the jury. It would have been wrong for the trial judge to warn the jury that they must treat this evidence as though it had been given by children of immature years and to have warned them of the special risk in acting on the uncorroborated evidence of a young child, even when sworn.\nWhen the charge is read as a whole, there was no substance to the argument that the trial judge had failed to instruct the jury to convict the accused of non-capital murder in case they had any doubt of his having committed capital murder.\nThe Court of Appeal could only exercise its jurisdiction to set aside the conviction on the ground that the evidence was an unsafe foundation for conviction, if it found that the jury could not reasonably have convicted of capital murder on the evidence. In this case, there was very substantial evidence to go to the jury of planned and deliberate murder, and it would have been unwarranted interference with the function of the jury to substitute the finding of the Court of Appeal for that of the jury on this point.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the conviction of the accused on a charge of capital murder. Appeal dismissed.\nC.L. Dubin, Q.C., for the appellant.\nW.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The appellant was convicted in the year 1961 of the capital murder of his wife committed in the year 1952. His appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed by unanimous judgment and he now appeals to this Court pursuant to s. 597(a) of the Criminal Code enacted by 9-10 Elizabeth II, Chapter 44.\nIn 1952 the accused was a married man with five small children. The three eldest were James, Margaret and Ann, then 12, 10 and 8 years old. There were two other children then 5 and 1\u00bd years old. All these children were living in a small, one-room cabin with their father and mother on August 2, 1952, and the three eldest gave evidence in the year 1961 that would show that their father had killed their mother early in the morning nine years before. In 1952 the appellant was a farmer in the County of Perth near Listowel. He had lost some of his farm buildings by fire and in the summer of 1952 he went to work in a sawmill at Johnson\u2019s Harbour, in a remote part of the Bruce Peninsula, 15 to 20 miles south of Tobermory and 4\u00bd miles in from the highway that runs between Wiarton and Tobermory. He first of all occupied the small cabin as living quarters with three young men, who were also working at the sawmill. His wife was still living on the farm 90 miles away. During this period he began an adulterous association with a married woman in Wiarton. She knew him as a widower with 5 children. When the school term ended, the appellant brought his wife and 5 children to Johnson\u2019s Harbour and they all lived in the small, one-room cabin and for part of the time two of the three young men also lived there. But some time before August 2, 1952, the young men went home, leaving as occupants of the cabin Kendall, his wife and the children. During this period he was continuing his association with the married woman in Wiarton. It was also during this period that he made a visit to his farm with this woman and made an attempt to get her installed as a housekeeper with a neighbouring farmer with whom he had business dealings. When he made this visit back to the farm his wife remained at Johnson\u2019s Harbour with the children.\nThe three elder children gave evidence of what they saw during the early dawn of the day on which they left the cabin. This day was August 2, 1952. The submissions on this appeal make some review of this evidence necessary. Margaret said that she saw her father dragging the limp body of her mother out of the cabin and past the window, that he rolled up two blankets from the bed and took them out, that there was blood on the floor at the foot of the bed and that subsequently, she found that the butcher knife was missing, and that her father returned to the cabin a short time later and mopped the floor.\nAnn\u2019s evidence is that she heard her mother cry, \u201cArthur, please don\u2019t\u201d. She saw her father lay a knife with blood on it on the table and then drag her mother out of the cabin and down the road. He returned to the cabin and gathered up a bed sheet and some of her mother\u2019s clothes and the knife, wiped blood from the floor and left the cabin again. Her sister Margaret put her hand over her mouth to keep her quiet. James, when he awakened, heard his mother cry, \u201cDon\u2019t Art.\u201d He saw his father drag the limp body of his mother out of the cabin. He saw the bloody knife on the table and blood on the floor. His father was wearing hip rubber boots. When the father returned to the cabin he wiped the blood off the knife and off the floor. He also saw the father take bed clothes away.\nMargaret said she remained quiet because it had been a strict family rule that the children would not get up or make any noise until their parents called them. She placed her hand over her younger sister\u2019s mouth to prevent her from crying out. James said that he was too frightened to make a noise because he was wondering if his father was going to come back and \u201cget the rest of them\u201d.\nAfter his return to the cabin the appellant got the children out of bed, arranged their breakfast and went to work as usual. He told Margaret that if anybody asked where her mother was she was to say that she left on Thursday, which was two days before. On his return to the cabin from his work at the sawmill the appellant put the children in the car and went to Wiarton to the other woman. He moved in with her along with the 5 children, of whom this woman had only seen one, on a previous occasion. Next day the appellant returned to the cabin with his son James and a son of this woman to collect some of his belongings. He left a note that he was leaving his employment because he had to get in his flax harvest and had had family troubles. There is evidence that on this Sunday, August 3, the wife\u2019s purse, which was the only one that she had with her, was still in the cabin. A few days later both families moved back to the family farm in the County of Perth. Some time later Kendall asked the owner of the sawmill to send his wife\u2019s ring which had been left in the cabin. Nothing was ever heard again of the appellant\u2019s wife.\nThere is evidence that the appellant spread word in his neighborhood that his wife had left him for another man. Those neighbours who gave evidence indicated disbelief in any such story. When one of them made it clear to Kendall that he did not believe him, Kendall changed his story and said that his wife had gone back to her mother. This neighbour then telephoned the wife\u2019s relatives, who came to inquire about her and reported the matter to the police. The police made inquiries and searches but never found the body. They also questioned the children at the time but the children would not give any information about their mother\u2019s disappearance beyond the fact that she had gone away alone on the Thursday before they left the cabin. One of them gave evidence in some detail of what she was wearing at the time she left.\nAnn was the first of the children who talked to the police in 1961. She did so after a disagreement with her stepmother and after leaving her father\u2019s house. At this time the daughter Margaret was married and living in Winnipeg. Ann telephoned her sister Margaret and told her that she had informed the police of what had happened in 1952. James continued to live with his father until after the preliminary hearing.\nThe contradiction between what the children said in 1952 and what they said in 1961 raised a serious question of credibility. This was clearly and adequately put to the jury on evidence that the children were under fear and intimidation. They never discussed what they had seen among themselves and they never mentioned it to any outside person until 1961. The jury was fully seized of this matter and there could be no attack on the judge\u2019s instruction on this ground.\nThe substantial attack on the children\u2019s evidence was that the trial judge failed in his duty to warn the jury as to the care with which such evidence should be weighed. The argument is that the evidence of the children given when they were grown up suffers from the same frailty which would have attached to it had they given their evidence as children and that it could not be any stronger when given in 1961 than it would have been if given in 1952.\nThe basis for the rule of practice which requires the judge to warn the jury of the danger of convicting on the evidence of a child, even when sworn as a witness, is the mental immaturity of the child. The difficulty is fourfold: 1. His capacity of observation. 2. His capacity of recollection. 3. His capacity to understand questions put and frame intelligent answers. 4. His moral responsibility. (Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd ed., para. 506.)\nThe last point, a sense of moral responsibility, disappears when the children are of mature years and understand the duty to speak the truth. When these children gave evidence they were respectively 21, 19 and 17 years of age. They were in the same position at that age as any other witness. Their capacity of communication was likewise the same as that of any other witness. It is quite clear that they were testifying as mature persons to what they had observed as children. But they were not testifying to a routine matter that had happened 9 years before. If they were telling the truth, what they had seen must have made an indelible impression on their minds at the time and must have been something that they could never forget. Again, the trial judge clearly and adequately instructed the jury, if any such instruction was needed, that these witnesses were mature witnesses testifying to something that had happened 9 years before. Questions of weight and credibility in these circumstances were entirely for the jury. It would, in my opinion, have been wrong for the trial judge to warn the jury that they must treat this evidence as though it had been given by children of immature years and to have warned them of the special risk in acting on the uncorroborated evidence of a young child, even when sworn. This would be a totally unwarranted and undesirable extension of the rule of practice. The need for this special warning disappears when the children give evidence as mature persons. It then becomes a matter of weight and credibility for the jury.\nIn this case we do not, in fact, know what a trial judge, sitting in 1952, would have done with the evidence of these children. What we do know is that in 1961 they were fully competent, testifying to recollections of revolting events that happened 9 years before and there was ample instruction given on the question of credibility, testimonial capacity and recollections.\nI turn now to the submission that the learned trial judge in his charge failed to direct the jury in express terms that if they entertained any doubt between capital murder and non-capital murder, they must give the accused the benefit of the doubt and convict of non-capital murder only. Any force in this submission entirely disappears when the charge is read as a whole. Counsel for the accused did not question the correctness of the judge\u2019s charge of capital murder. He told them correctly and clearly what they must find beyond a reasonable doubt before they could convict of this offence. He told them that if they entertained any reasonable doubt on any of the ingredients of the offence, they must acquit of capital murder. He told them correctly what they had to find to bring in a verdict of non-capital murder and told them correctly that if they entertained a reasonable doubt on this, they must acquit. When read as a whole there could be no doubt left in the jury\u2019s mind that if they entertained a reasonable doubt on capital murder but still found that the accused intended to kill his wife or meant to cause her bodily harm that he knew to be likely to cause death and was reckless whether death ensued or not, they must find non-capital murder, and that if they entertained any reasonable doubt on either score, they must acquit. There is no substance to this objection.\nIt was also submitted that this is a case where the Court of Appeal should have exercised its jurisdiction to set aside the conviction because of an irresistible conclusion that the evidence was an unsafe foundation for a conviction. Undoubtedly the Court of Appeal has this jurisdiction but in order to exercise it here, it would have to find that the jury could not reasonably convict the appellant of capital murder on the evidence. It is, of course, no answer to the exercise of this jurisdiction by an appellate court for the prosecution to say that there was some evidence to go to the jury and that the appellate court should not interfere. But this is not such a case. There was very substantial evidence here to go to the jury of a planned and deliberate murder and it would be unwarranted interference with the function of the jury to substitute the finding of an appellate court for that of the jury on this point.\nThe appellant also seeks a new trial on the ground that his defence was prejudiced by the introduction into evidence of two pillows taken from his residence in 1961. The evidence was that there were bloodstains on these pillows and that such blood had been on the pillows for a period of from 6 months to 15 years. This objection should be rejected. The pillows must be considered in relation to the whole of the evidence, including that of the children. The objection to them is entirely a matter of weight. They undoubtedly had some relevancy but I notice that in his address to the jury, counsel for the Crown did not mention them, the learned trial judge did not mention them but counsel for the defence did deal with them and made his submission that they had no weight in the circumstances of the case. The evidence was not improperly admitted. It was not unduly emphasized as to weight and it must be considered, not in isolation, but as part and parcel of a large volume of evidence given during the course of a lengthy trial.\nAt the conclusion of the argument in the Court of Appeal, Laidlaw J.A., in delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court, noted that the charge was complete and correct in all matters touching the issues to be determined by the jury and that there was no room for misunderstanding or want of understanding on the part of the jury as to the principles of law properly applicable to the evidence and that the verdict was given according to law. I respectfully agree with this conclusion.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McAvoy, Craig & McKerroll, Owen Sound.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.C.

The Queen, [1962] S.C.R. 476\nDate: 1962-03-26\nFrederick J. Cowan (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nHer Majesty The Queen (Defendant) Respondent.\n1962: March 13, 14, 26.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nCriminal law\u2014Forgery\u2014Forged endorsement of cheque\u2014Intent to prejudice\u2014Defence of authorization\u2014Admissibility of evidence\u2014Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 309(1)(a).\nThe accused, a solicitor, acted for Mrs. F in an expropriation proceeding and for that purpose retained the services of O, a real estate consultant. O submitted an account of $300 to the accused who forwarded it to Mrs. F. The latter caused her daughter to deliver to the accused a cheque payable to O in that amount. The accused endorsed the name of O on the back of the cheque and cashed it. A letter from Mrs. F, dated some months later, addressed to O, in which she expressed her surprise to learn that he had not been paid by the accused, was admitted in evidence. Subsequent to this letter the accused sent his cheque to O, but it was not honoured. Mrs. F testified, in cross-examination, that her daughter had reported to her some two weeks after the delivery of the cheque that she had told the accused at that time that he was free to do as he wished with the cheque. The defence was that the accused was authorized to endorse the cheque and that O was eventually paid at a later date. The accused was convicted of forgery, and his appeal was dismissed. He was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau, Fauteux and Judson JJ.: There was no admissible evidence in the record to support the defence of authorization and the facts indicated that that defence was ill\u2011founded and was an afterthought. Even if the hearsay evidence given by Mrs. F concerning the authorization to deal with the cheque was properly before the jury, it provided no answer to the charge. Nothing that went on between the accused and Mrs. F\u2019s daughter could authorize the accused to sign O\u2019s name on the back of the cheque. When the accused signed O\u2019s name as endorser, he did so to the prejudice of O and the offence was proved. The accused made a false document knowing it to be false with the intent that it should be acted upon as genuine to the prejudice of O. It made no difference that O was eventually paid and that if things had been done another way the accused might have had a defence. Nor did it matter that when this cheque was in the accused\u2019s hands with instructions for delivery countermanded, if they were, O could not have successfully sued for its delivery.\nPer Taschereau and Fauteux JJ.: The only material in the record to support the defence of authorization was that conversation between Mrs. F and her daughter and that evidence was inadmissible as hearsay evidence. The fact that there was no objection to it was entirely immaterial, because the absence of objection did not give it any probative value. There was consequently no evidence whatever in the record to support this alleged defence. It could not be said that the accused, in the circumstances of this case, could honestly have thought that the admission of that hearsay evidence made it unnecessary for him to testify or to call Mrs. F\u2019s daughter to give evidence. As to the letter by Mrs. F to O, it was inadmissible. However, it became immaterial as it could not be held to contradict a fact which was not proved.\nPer Cartwright and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: The trial judge improperly admitted in evidence the letter from Mrs. F to O and this resulted in a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.\nThis appeal should be dealt with on the basis that the hearsay evidence given by Mrs. F concerning the accused\u2019s authority to deal with the cheque was properly before the jury. That evidence was put in without objection and was treated by the trial judge and by both counsel at the trial as being properly before the jury. Had it not been so treated it was possible that the daughter would have been called as a witness and that the accused would have given evidence. It was open to the jury on that evidence to find that Mrs. F had in fact given the accused authority to cash the cheque or to deal with it as he saw fit, and that on that view it was open to them to find that an intent to prejudice O had not been established; and that was the real defence which the trial judge failed to put to the jury. But the inadmissible letter of Mrs. F, which was objected to by defence counsel, would almost certainly prevent the jury from taking that view of the evidence. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the conviction of the accused on a charge of forgery. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.\nE.P. Hartt, for the appellant.\nJohn J. Freeman, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nFAUTEUX J.:\u2014I agree with my brother Judson and only wish to express my views as to one particular aspect which, with deference, is fatal to this appeal.\nThe defence raised by the appellant is that Mrs. Finlay expressly authorized him to deal as he saw fit with the cheque made by her to the order of Outram. The only material in the record that can possibly be referred to, in an attempt to support the fact that such authority was ever given to or received by appellant, is that part of Mrs. Finlay\u2019s testimony where, in cross\u2011examination by counsel for the accused, she relates a conversation she had with her daughter Mary some two weeks after remittance of this cheque by the latter to the appellant:\nQ. Would you tell his honour and the gentlemen of the jury what that conversation was.\nA. She came home and she said that Fred needed money, and she said: \u201cMother, I told him to go ahead and cash the cheque. Is that all right?\u201d, and I said: \u201cI guess it is\u201d because we owed him money too.\nAdmittedly such evidence is inadmissible as hearsay evidence. The fact that there was no objection to it is entirely immaterial: Schmidt v. The King[2]. The absence of objection does not give this hearsay evidence any probative value. This part of Mrs. Finlay\u2019s testimony is no evidence of the truth of what her daughter told her and a fortiori of what her daughter reported as having been told by appellant. There is consequently no evidence whatever in the record to support this alleged defence advanced on behalf of appellant.\nIt is said, however, that this inadmissible evidence having been admitted and dealt with at trial as if it were admissible, the accused, for that reason, may well have honestly considered that there was no need for him to testify or call Mrs. Finlay\u2019s daughter to give evidence supporting this alleged defence of authorization. Assuming that such an argument could be put forward in a proper case, in my opinion, it cannot be said that the accused could honestly have thought that the admission of that hearsay evidence made it unnecessary for him to testify or to call Mrs. Finlay\u2019s daughter to give evidence. For, at the close of the case for the prosecution, the record contained evidence elicited by cross-examination of Mrs. Finlay by his own counsel, which clearly indicated that she never gave such an authorization. The evidence shows that after several attempts to obtain payment of his account, Outram received this letter dated July 13, 1959, from the appellant:\nSuite 33-34 Office: CE2-2341\n74 Sparks St. CE2-2350\nOttawa 4, Ontario\nFREDERICK JAMES COWAN\nBarrister Solicitor Notary Public\nSupreme Court and Parliamentary Agent\nJuly 13, 1959.\nMr. A.A. Outram,\n175 Rumsey Road,\nToronto, Ontario.\nRe: Cora Finlay Expropriation\nDear Sir:\nI enclose herewith my cheque in the amount of $300.00 in payment for your services in regard to the above matter.\nI apologize for the delay in this matter and I was under the impression that you had been paid.\nPerhaps the mix-up was due to my change in offices as I am unable to find the above client\u2019s file. In any event I apologize for any embarrassment that may have been caused to you in the above entanglement.\nSincerely yours,\nss\/fc Frederick J. Cowan\nAttached to this letter was a cheque for $300 dated July 10, 1959, drawn on the Toronto\u2011Dominion Bank in Ottawa-South, payable to the order of A.A. Outram and signed Ronco Auto Parts Reg\u2019d, per: Frederick Cowan. On this cheque appeared the notation: \u201cRe: Finlay\u201d. Having been endorsed and deposited by Outram, it was returned marked \u201cNot sufficient funds\u201d. When cross-examined on this matter by counsel for the accused, Outram gave the following evidence:\nQ. Did you telephone Mrs. Finlay and advise her of that fact\u2014that is, Mrs. Cora Finlay?\nA. Yes, I advised her after the cheque was returned N.S.F.\nQ. In that telephone conversation you had with her do you recollect whether or not you told her that she was dealing with crooks, and you were going to retain your own lawyer when he came back from his holidays?\nA. I don\u2019t remember the first part because I think perhaps she knew it and told me, because she started telling me immediately: \u201cWell, I have paid him long enough ago the money to give you\u201d, but as nearly as I can remember I said: \u201cI am\u2026\u201d\u2014yes: \u201cIf I am not paid very soon I will take it up with my lawyer\u201d, who was Mr. John Arnup of Mason, Foulds, Arnup, Walter and Weir, and I think I said I would take it up with the Bar Association if I did not get it in due course.\nQ. Your recollection is that you intimated to her that you were going to take it up with your own solicitor?\nA. Yes.\nQ. But you have no recollection of saying she was dealing with crooks?\nA. No, I think she brought that point out instead of me when she said she had given him the money long ago.\nSubsequent to this testimony and again in cross-examination by counsel for the appellant, Mrs. Finlay was referred to this telephone conversation related by Outram and gave the following testimony:\nQ. Mrs. Finlay, Mr. Outram, a prior witness, has testified that he made a telephone call to you after a certain cheque forwarded to him was returned N.S.F. In that telephone call did you refer to anybody as a crook?\nA. Oh, no, I don\u2019t think so.\nThis answer is a clear admission that she had that telephone conversation with Outram and that the only part thereof which remained open to question was whether she had referred to anybody as a crook, to which she answered she did not think so. This telephone conversation is evidence that Mrs. Finlay never gave the authorization contended for and, with deference, it cannot be contended that the accused could sincerely and honestly have thought that there was no need for him to give or call evidence to show that he had received from Mrs. Finlay the alleged authorization. With respect to the letter written on the 7th of July 1959 by Mrs. Finlay to Outram, wherein the former expressed to the latter her surprise to learn that he had not been paid by Cowan, I agree that it was inadmissible. However, holding the view that there was no evidence at all to establish that appellant had received authority to deal with this cheque as he saw fit, this letter became immaterial as it could not be held to contradict a fact which was not proved.\nFor the reasons of my brother Judson and those here given, I would say that there is no substance in this appeal from the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario and that it should be dismissed.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The appellant was convicted of forgery under s. 309(1) (a) of the Criminal Code and his conviction was affirmed on appeal. The precise form of the count in the indictment on which he was convicted was that he did\nforge an endorsement on a certain document, to wit, a cheque drawn on the Royal Bank of Canada, Perth Ontario Branch, dated Perth, January 23rd, 1959, to the order of A.A. Outram, for $300.00, with intent that the same should be used or acted upon as genuine, to the prejudice of the said A.A. Outram, contrary to Section 310(1) of the Criminal Code.\nThe defence was that the Crown failed to prove that the accused had the necessary intent required by s. 309(1) (a) of the Code, which reads:\n309. (1) Every one commits forgery who makes a false document, knowing it to be false, with intent\n(a) that it should in any way be used or acted upon as genuine, to the prejudice of any one whether within Canada or not.\nCowan was a solicitor practising in the City of Ottawa. He acted for Mrs. Finlay in an expropriation proceeding and for that purpose retained the services of one Outram as an expert witness. On completion of his work, Outram sent to Cowan his account for $300. Mrs. Finlay then drew a cheque payable to Outram for $300 for payment of this account. She had her daughter take the cheque to Cowan\u2019s office. Cowan signed Outram\u2019s name on the back of the cheque and obtained cash from the Plaza Hotel. The hotel endorsed the cheque and it was duly paid by the bank on which it was drawn. The defence is founded on the fact that Mrs. Finlay was in some doubt between Outram and Cowan as the proper payee of the cheque; that her daughter had reported to her, some time after the delivery of the cheque to Cowan, that she had told Cowan, at the time of delivery, that he was free to do as he wished with it. Mrs. Finlay acquiesced in what her daughter had done because she owed Cowan money for his account, not yet rendered, in the expropriation proceedings.\nThis evidence came out in a very peculiar way. Neither Cowan nor the daughter gave evidence and therefore there was no admissible evidence that any such conversation ever took place between the daughter and Cowan. The trial judge might well have ruled out this evidence of the mother. It is indeed very doubtful whether any such authority was given to Cowan, for many months later when Mrs. Finlay received a letter from Outram stating that his bill still remained unpaid, she replied that she thought it had already been paid and that she had sent a cheque to Mr. Cowan a long time ago. This indicates that the defence of an authorization was ill-founded and was an afterthought. Why would Mrs. Finlay say that she had sent a cheque to Cowan to pay this bill if she had authorized Cowan to use the cheque for his own purposes? But this letter from Mrs. Finlay to Outram was also inadmissible.\nI would, however, deal with this appeal on the basis that the hearsay evidence given by Mrs. Finlay concerning Cowan\u2019s authority to deal with the cheque was properly before the jury. In my opinion it provides no answer to the charge. There was an existing indebtedness between Mrs. Finlay and Outram and the cheque, in the first place, was given to pay that indebtedness. As it was issued this cheque could only be negotiated by Outram and it was not so negotiated. Nothing that went on between Cowan and Mrs. Finlay\u2019s daughter could authorize Cowan to sign Outram\u2019s name on the back of the cheque. If the cheque was to be used at all in the form in which it was drawn, there could be only one endorser, namely, Outram. When Cowan signed Outram\u2019s name as endorser, he did it to the prejudice of Outram and the offence is proved. Cowan made a false document knowing it to be false with the intent that it should be acted upon as genuine to the prejudice of Outram. If there was error in the direction of the learned trial judge to the jury on this point, it was error in favour of Cowan when he told the jury that if Cowan had reasonable grounds to believe that he was authorized to act as he did, then they must acquit. The proper instruction would have been that there was no evidence before the jury that Cowan had any ground for belief that he was authorized to deal with the cheque as he actually did, that this authority could not come from Mrs. Finlay, and that it was quite clear that it did not come from Outram.\nIt makes no difference that Outram was eventually paid and that if things had been done another way Cowan might have had a defence. If, in fact, Mrs. Finlay\u2019s instructions to deliver the cheque to Outram were countermanded and Cowan was authorized to deal with the cheque as he chose, he might have inserted his own name as payee and crossed out Outram\u2019s name or he might have made the cheque payable to bearer or he might have destroyed it.\nNor does it matter that when this cheque was in Cowan\u2019s hands with instructions for delivery countermanded, if they ever were, Outram could not have successfully sued for delivery of the cheque. This cheque was an unconditional order in writing drawn by Mrs. Finlay and addressed to the bank to pay to the order of Outram, who was her creditor. It was not made payable to a fictitious or non-existing person. In the form in which it was drawn it could only be endorsed by Outram. Outranks signature was endorsed by Cowan and this act, as the Court of Appeal has held, was to the prejudice of Outram.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts out of which this appeal arises are stated in the reasons of my brother Judson which I have had the advantage of reading. I think it desirable, however, to set out the words in which Mrs. Finlay related the circumstances surrounding the drawing of the cheque and its delivery to the appellant.\nMrs. Finlay was called by the Crown. In her examination in chief, she stated that her daughter Mary was present when she drew and signed the cheque, that she had not received a bill from Cowan for his services but understood his charges would be in the neighbourhood of $500. Her evidence in chief continues as follows:\nThe WITNESS: I didn\u2019t really owe Mr. Outram money. It was Mr. Cowan. Mr. Outram never really billed me, but we owed him money, and I had a little discussion with my daughter as to who I should make the cheque out to, and she said: \u201cMother, we owe both of them money\u201d, and she said: \u201cMake it out to Mr. Outram, and if Fred wants it he can have it\u201d. He had a power of attorney.\n* * *\nQ. Coming back to the cheque in question, Mrs. Finlay, the name \u201cA.A. Outram\u201d is written very legibly on this cheque. When you made it out to whom did you make it out at that time on January 23, 1959?\nA. I made it out to that name; Mr. Outram.\nQ. Then what did you do with the cheque?\nA. I gave it to my daughter and she brought it into Ottawa.\nQ. Did you give her certain instructions when you gave it to her?\nA. I said: \u201cGive that to Mr. Cowan, and he will do with it as he sees fit\u201d.\nQ. As he sees fit?\nA. Yes.\n* * *\nIn cross-examination, Mrs. Finlay gave the following evidence:\nQ. And to make it abundantly clear, Mrs. Finlay, in the first instance you would have had no objection at all to making the cheque for $300, Exhibit No. 5, payable to Mr. Cowan, or to Mr. Cowan using it?\nA. No; how could I have?\nQ. Because you owed him money?\nA. Yes, because I owed him money.\nQ. And in the second instance, even though you made the cheque payable to A.A. Outram, and it was given to Mary to give to Mr. Cowan, you had no objection, and still have no objection, to Mr. Cowan\u2019s having negotiated it by putting down Mr. Outram\u2019s name?\nA. No, neither has Mr. Outram.\nQ. You were not done out of it, and Mr. Outram has been paid?\nA. That is right. I cannot see the point of it.\n* * *\nQ. You told us that about two weeks later Mary came back to Perth?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did you have a conversation with her over this cheque, Exhibit No. 5?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Would you tell his honour and the gentlemen of the jury what that conversation was? A. She came home and she said that Fred needed the money, and she said: \u201cMother, I told him to go ahead and cash the cheque. Is that all right\u201d?, and I said: \u201cI guess it is\u201d because we owed him money too.\nQ. That was the conversation?\nA. Yes.\nQ. So two or three weeks after you gave the cheque to Mary you knew Mr. Cowan had gone ahead and cashed the cheque?\nA. That is correct.\nQ. Did Mary look after most of your business interests in Ottawa?\nA. Yes, she did.\nQ. And did she have general authority to look after your business interests in Ottawa?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And as far as you were concerned did Mary have the authority to authorize Mr. Cowan to negotiate the cheque?\nA. Well, as I told her so I guess she had.\nWhile some of this evidence may have been admissible to prove the extent of the authority which Mrs. Finlay had given to her daughter, Mary, it was not admissible to prove the conversation between Mary and Cowan alleged to have taken place at the time the cheque was delivered to him. However, in the peculiar circumstances of this case, I think that we should deal with this appeal on the basis, set out in the reasons of my brother Judson, that the hearsay evidence given by Mrs. Finlay concerning Cowan\u2019s authority to deal with the cheque was properly before the jury.\nI reach this conclusion for the following reasons. Mrs. Finlay\u2019s evidence quoted above was put in without objection and was treated by the learned trial judge and by both counsel at the trial as being properly before the jury. Had it not been so treated it is possible that the defence would have called Mary as a witness and that the appellant would have given evidence. It would be contrary to the manner in which the trials of criminal cases are conducted to tacitly treat evidence favourable to an accused as being properly before the court and later to reject it after the opportunity to supply admissible evidence of the same facts has passed.\nOn the other hand, the admission of the letter dated July 7, 1959, written by Mrs. Finlay to Outram was objected to by defence counsel and, after some discussion in the absence of the jury, was admitted notwithstanding his objection. In my view, it was open to the jury on the evidence quoted above to find that when, through the agency of her daughter, Mrs. Finlay handed the cheque to Cowan she, through the same agency, not only refrained from instructing him to deliver it to Outram but expressly authorized him to cash it or deal with it in such other manner as he saw fit.\nOf course such an authorization given by the drawer of the cheque would not have given Cowan the right to sign the name of Outram as endorser but it would have given him the right to make the cheque payable to bearer and to cash it, or the right to destroy it or to return it to Mrs. Finlay and ask her to send him another cheque payable to himself. On the suggested view of the facts, which it was open to the jury to take, Outram had no property interest in the cheque and no right to require Cowan to deliver it to him. He was no more delayed or prejudiced in fact by Cowan having endorsed his name than he would have been if Cowan had adopted any of the other permissible courses suggested above.\nWith the greatest respect, it appears to me that the learned trial judge failed to put the real theory of the defence adequately to the jury. The case was put to them as if the main question was whether Cowan believed on reasonable grounds that he had the right to endorse Outram\u2019s name on the cheque, whereas the theory of the defence was that although Cowan, of course, had no right to sign Outram\u2019s name and did in fact sign it, he did so without any intent to prejudice Outram.\nI have already expressed my opinion that it was open to the jury on the evidence to find that Mrs. Finlay had in fact given Cowan authority to cash the cheque or to deal with it as he saw fit and that on that view it was open to them to find that an intent to prejudice Outram had not been established; but the inadmissible letter of Mrs. Finlay of July 7, 1959, would almost certainly prevent the jury taking the view of the evidence which I have just suggested.\nThe Court of Appeal rightly held that the letter was clearly inadmissible but concluded that its admission did not result in any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. With respect, I cannot share that view. The letter would tend to make the jury reject the only view of the evidence upon which the appellant might have been acquitted. I do not intend to suggest that the jury should have drawn from the evidence the view of the facts favourable to the appellant which I have outlined above but it was open to them to do so, and they may have regarded the inadmissible letter as decisive against this view.\nI find it necessary to base my judgment on only one of the grounds on which leave to appeal was granted, that is ground number 5 which reads:\nThat the Learned Trial Judge erred in directing the Jury that they were entitled to rely on the truth of the contents of Exhibit 10 (the letter of July 7, 1959) when in fact it was not properly in evidence at the trial for that or any other purpose.\nFor the above reasons, I would allow the appeal and quash the conviction. As it is the view of the majority of the Court that the appeal fails nothing would be gained by considering what further order should have been made had the appeal succeeded.\nAppeal dismissed, CARTWRIGHT and RITCHIE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.

(Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nThe Royal Bank of Canada (Defendant) Intervenant;\nand\nHe Attorney-General for Ontario Respondent.\n1962: March 12, 13; 1962: June 11.\nPresent: Taschereau, Locke, Cartwright, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nMechanics\u2019 liens\u2014Statutory trust fund provisions\u2014Payment to contractor deposited m current account\u2014Deposit applied by bank to reduce contractor\u2019s overdraft\u2014Unpaid accounts of sub\u2011contractors\u2014Extent of bank\u2019s knowledge as to breach of trust\u2014No notice given of assignment of book debts held by bank. A cheque for $77,000 representing the greater part of a holdback on a contract for the construction of a public building was drawn by the County of Lambton in favour of the contractor of the project. The contracting company deposited the cheque in its current account with the defendant bank and the latter applied the deposit towards the reduction of the company\u2019s overdraft. The contractor was from time to time a borrower from the bank and these borrowings were secured by a general assignment of book debts from the contractor to the defendant, a guarantee by the president of the company, and the deposit of certain securities. Although registered, no notice of the assignment of book debts was given to anyone.\nThe plaintiffs were sub-contractors whose accounts remained unpaid. They claimed that they were beneficiaries of the trust created by s. 3(1) of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 227, as amended by 1952, c. 54, s. 1, and that the bank must account to them because it received their money, appropriated it to its own use and therefore participated in a breach of trust. The plaintiff\u2019s action was dismissed by the trial judge and this decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The plaintiffs then appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Locke J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau, Abbott, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The only knowledge that the bank had of a possibility that the contractor was a trustee was imputed knowledge of the provisions of s. 3(1) of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, assuming that the branch manager knew of this provision of the Act. But in the circumstances of the case, he did not know and had no reason to inquire into the possibility of a breach of trust. Fonthill Lumber Ltd. v. Bank of Montreal, [1959] O.R. 451, distinguished.\nThe basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that they were entitled to succeed on the authority of Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co. Ltd. v. Empire Brass Mfg. Co. Ltd., [1955] S.C.R. 694, and Canadian Bank of Commerce v. McAvity, [1959] S.C.R. 478, was that the bank held an assignment of book debts from the customer and that this document provided that all moneys received by the customer from the collection of debts under the assignment should be received in trust for the bank, and that if the bank\u2019s trustee or agent received these moneys in trust for the bank, they were already subject to the prior statutory trust created by s. 3(1) in favour of the plaintiffs. The fallacy in the argument was that the contractor did not receive the cheque under the assignment of book debts as trustee for the bank. The bank made no use of this assignment and served no notice on the county under it. Until notice was given, the assignment could have no effect on a payment made in the ordinary course of business by the county to the contractor.\nPer Cartwright and Ritchie JJ.: The evidence was clear that the bank manager did not know that the customer was committing a breach of trust and therefore could not have knowingly participated therein. The principle of law that where a trustee has overdrawn his banking account, his bankers have a first and paramount legal lien on all moneys paid in by him, unless they have notice, not only that they are trust moneys, but also that the payment to them constitutes a breach of trust, was applicable here.\nThe bank had no notice, actual or constructive, of any breach of trust committed by the construction company. The plaintiffs\u2019 argument, based on the existence of the assignment of book debts, that when the bank acquired legal title to the $77,000 it did so with notice of the trust in favour of the plaintiffs was rejected. When the cheque was deposited in the overdrawn account neither the bank nor the construction company was acting in pursuance of the assignment; they were acting not as assignee and assignor or as cestui que trust and trustee but as bank and customer in the ordinary course of business. Neither the county nor the plaintiffs were aware of or parties to the assignment; the only parties to it were the bank and the construction company and the former did not act on it. In view of the manner in which the dealings between the bank and the construction company were carried on the existence of the assignment was irrelevant. Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co. Ltd. v. Empire Brass Mfg. Co. Ltd., supra distinguished.\nPer Martland and Ritchie JJ.: The situation which arose upon the contractor\u2019s receipt of the money, paid by the county, was that he became trustee thereof for competing beneficiaries; i.e., the plaintiffs, as sub-contractors pursuant to s. 3 of the Act, and the defendant, by virtue of the clause in its assignment providing that all moneys received by the contractor from the collection of debts under the assignment should be received in trust for the bank. The contractor, who had an overdraft, then paid the money into his bank account. The defendant received the deposit in good faith and gave value for it. The defendant, therefore, which initially had only an equitable right, subordinate to that of the plaintiffs, acquired legal title to the money, bona fide, for value, without notice of any breach of trust on the part of the contractor.\nSo long as the defendant was unaware that, by paying the money to it, the contractor was committing a breach of trust, the fact that the defendant had, itself, previously had an equitable interest in the money could not alter the application of the principle that where a trustee has overdrawn his banking account, his bankers have a first and paramount legal lien on all moneys paid in by him, unless they have notice not only that they are trust moneys, but also that the payment to them constitutes a breach of trust.\nPer Locke J., dissenting: By virtue of the assignment of book debts from the contractor to the defendant, the moneys owing by the county to the contractor on the completion of the work were, as between the contractor and the bank, the property of the bank. When the cheque was issued payable to the contractor in satisfaction of part of that debt, it was received by it as trustee for the bank, subject to the statutory trust attaching to the moneys under the provisions of s. 3 of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act. The contractor qua trustee was obligated to transfer the cheque to the bank, which was done by endorsement and delivery. The right of the defendant to retain the moneys realized from the cheque was not as holder in due course of that instrument, but as owner of the debt by the county to the contractor which had been assigned to it. The fact that no notice of the assignment of book debts had been given to the county was aside from the point. The question was merely one of determining in what manner as between the bank and its customer it became entitled to these moneys.\nThe defendant\u2019s claim to the moneys was qua assignee and they were received by it subject to the statutory trust in favour of the plaintiffs by virtue of s. 3 of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act. Minneapolis\u2011Honeywell Regulator Co. Ltd. v. Empire Brass Mfg. Co. Ltd., supra, referred to. Constitutional law\u2014Constitutionality of s. S of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 227, as amended by 1952 (Ont.), c. 54, s. 1.\nPer Taschereau, Abbott, Judson and Ritchie JJ.:\nWhile the rights given by s. 3(1) of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act did not depend on the right to a lien, it was competent provincial legislation in relation to the obligations of a building contractor, which was clearly within s. 92 (13) of the British North America Act. There was no conflict with federal legislation in either of the fields of banking or bankruptcy.\nPer Locke J.: The right of the legislature to enact s. 3 of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act was undoubted under s. 92(13) of the British North America Act. The legislative power to impose a lien upon the land by The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act extended to declaring that, in addition, there was a charge upon the moneys in the hands of the contractor.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming a judgment of Wells J.

Their claim was rejected at the trial and on appeal (Morden J.A. dissenting). Section 3 reads:\n3. (1) All sums received by a builder or contractor or a subcontractor on account of the contract price shall be and constitute a trust fund in the hands of the builder or contractor, or of the subcontractor, as the case may be, for the benefit of the proprietor, builder or contractor, subcontractors, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, workmen and persons who have supplied material on account of the contract, and the builder or contractor or the subcontractor, as the case may be, shall be the trustee of all such sums so received by him, and until all workmen and all persons who have supplied material on the contract and all subcontractors are paid for work done or material supplied on the contract and the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board is paid any assessment with respect thereto, may not appropriate or convert any part thereof to his own use or to any use not authorized by the trust, 1942, chap. 34, s. 21.\nThe appellants were sub-contractors of Town & Country Construction Limited, which company held the main contract from the County of Lambton for the construction of a public building. Their accounts remained unpaid but they omitted to file claims for liens against the building. On March 2, 1956, the contractor deposited a cheque for $77,000 in its current account with the respondent bank. This cheque was drawn by the County of Lambton in favour of the contractor and represented the greater part of the holdback on this contract required under The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act. The appellants say that they are beneficiaries of the trust created by s. 3(1) of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act and that the bank must pay them because it received their money, appropriated it to its own use and therefore participated in a breach of trust.\nThe facts are fully stated in the judgments of the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal. I will summarize them briefly. The contractor\u2019s head office was in the Town of Brampton and its account was carried in the branch of the respondent bank in that town. The contractor was engaged on several important contracts at one time in widely separated parts of the province. It did not open a separate account for each contract. All its receipts went into one current account and its disbursements were paid from the same account. As far as I can see from the evidence, all its receipts were from owners for whom it was building and its disbursements were to sub-contractors, material men and wage-earners and for the other ordinary expenses of a firm of contractors. Its volume of business was large and its account was very active as is shown in the statement for the period December 15, 1955, to April 8, 1957, contained in the reasons of Porter C.J.O. On December 15, 1955, the overdraft was approximately $70,000. It reached almost $109,000 immediately before the payment in question in this action. The $77,000 deposit reduced the overdraft to $36,000. There was a credit balance in the account on March 13, 1956, because of the sale on instructions of the customer of $50,000 Dominion of Canada bonds held as security. After this date there was a credit balance in the account except for the period April 12 to April 20, 1956, when the overdraft was approximately $7,000. The account remained active until September 1956.\nAs security for the overdraft the bank held Government of Canada bonds of the face amount of $95,000, a general assignment of book debts, a guarantee of another company, a personal guarantee from the principal shareholder of the customer, and an assignment of a life insurance policy on that shareholder\u2019s life. After the sale of the $50,000 Dominion of Canada bonds on the customer\u2019s instructions and the establishment of a credit balance in the current account, the customer asked for and received the return of the remaining $45,000 Dominion of Canada bonds held as security. Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal reviewed in detail the dealings between bank and customer and came to the conclusion that the $77,000 deposit of March 2, 1956, was made and received in the ordinary course of business. These are concurrent findings of fact and should not be disturbed.\nWhat was the extent of the bank\u2019s knowledge when the customer made the deposit? It knew that the cheque for $77,000 had been received by the customer as part of the contract price on the construction project in the County of Lambton. It knew that this cheque represented a substantial part of the holdback. Payment by the county was therefore very strong evidence that the officials of the county thought that there were no enforceable mechanics\u2019 liens except those that had been provided for in the rest of the holdback. The bank had no knowledge of any unpaid accounts of the plaintiffs or of any other sub-contractors. The bank was in a fully secured position and had no knowledge of any financial difficulties of the customer and had no reason to suspect that the deposit in the current account of the customer was an appropriation or conversion of any part of the contract price to any use not authorized by the trust created by s. 3 of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act.\nOn these facts, with an amply secured overdraft and no reason to press for payment, a bank does not participate in a breach of trust merely because it receives payment by a cheque drawn by a third party in favour of the customer and deposited in the customer\u2019s current account. It seems to me that in the circumstances, the bank cannot be chargeable with notice of breach of trust. The strongest evidence of good faith is that the cheque was taken for value in the ordinary course of business and that as a result of the reduction in the overdraft and the sale of the securities to liquidate the remaining overdraft, the bank surrendered the balance of its security. It did not matter to the bank whether it was paid in the ordinary course or by a realization of security and the absence of benefit to the bank from the deposit is cogent evidence, on which the trial judge was entitled to act, of non-participation in a breach of trust.\nThe only knowledge that the bank had of a possibility that the contractor was a trustee was imputed knowledge of the provisions of s. 3(1) of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act and I make the same assumption as the Court of Appeal in this respect and take it that the branch manager knew of this provision of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act. But in the circumstances of this case, he did not know and had no reason to inquire into the possibility of a breach of trust and he is not chargeable with notice of a breach of trust. I agree with the judgment in the Court of Appeal and at trial in distinguishing this case from Fonthill Lumber Ltd. et al. v. Bank of Montreal[2], which is based on proof of knowledge of the existence of the trust under s. 3(1) and knowledge of the commission of a breach of trust.\nThe appellants also argued that they were entitled to succeed on the authority of Minneapolis\u2011Honeywell Regulator Co. Ltd. v. Empire Brass Mfg. Co. Ltd.[3] and Canadian Bank of Commerce v. McAvity[4]. The basis of this argument is that the bank held an assignment of book debts from the customer and that this document provided that all moneys received by the customer (i.e., the contractor) from the collection of the debts under assignment should be received in trust for the bank, and that if the bank\u2019s trustee or agent received these moneys in trust for the bank, they were already subject to the prior statutory trust created by s. 3(1) in favour of the appellants.\nThe fallacy in this argument is that the contractor did not receive this cheque under the assignment of book debts as trustee for the bank. The bank made no use of this assignment and served no notice on the County of Lambton under it. The assignment of book debts, it is true, was registered but until notice was given, it could have no effect on a payment made in the ordinary course of business by the County of Lambton to the contractor. Both judgments in the courts below properly distinguish a claim by the bank as assignee from the present one. There was no stakeholder against whom competing claims were being made by the bank as assignee of book debts and by s. 3(1) claimants as beneficiaries of a trust. The appellants\u2019 claims on this ground were properly rejected.\nThe respondent bank also submitted that this legislation was unconstitutional. While it is true that the rights given by s. 3(1) do not depend on the right to a lien, it is competent provincial legislation in relation to the obligations of a building contractor, which is clearly within s. 92(13) of the British North America Act. If there is any force in the submission, it must be because competent provincial legislation comes into conflict with and to that extent is overborne or rendered inapplicable by valid federal legislation. It is suggested that the legislation is in conflict with federal legislation on banking and bankruptcy but in my opinion the conflict does not exist in either field. The bank is in the same position with this trust as with any other trust and the ordinary principles must apply. The fact that it may make it difficult for the bank to deal with one particular class of customer does not raise a question of conflict. Nor does difficulty of dealing bring the legislation within the principles stated in Reference re Alberta Statutes[5].\nAs to bankruptcy, the creation of the trust by s. 3(1) does affect the amount of property divisible among the creditors but so does any other trust validly created.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nLOCKE J. (dissenting):\u2014The claims of the appellant companies against the respondent bank are for moneys due to them for services rendered under contracts with Town and Country Construction, Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the contractor) in connection with the building of a home for the aged in Petrolia, Ont. That work was done pursuant to a contract made between the contractor and the Corporation of the County of Lambton.\nThe contractor had been for several years prior to the performance of the work in question a customer of the branch of the bank at Brampton. By an instrument dated September 9, 1952, executed at Brampton and duly registered in the office of the County Court for Peel County as permitted by The Assignment of Book Debts Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 25, the contractor assigned to the respondent \u201call book accounts and book debts and generally all accounts, debts, dues and demands of every nature and kind howsoever arising or seecured and now due, owing or accruing or growing due, or which may hereafter become due, owing or accruing or growing due,\u201d. The assignment declared that the debts should be held by the bank as general and continuing collateral security for the fulfilment of all obligations of the customer to the bank and authorized the bank to collect, sue for and recover such debts and to give valid and binding receipts therefor. Paragraph 5 of the assignment read:\nAll moneys received by the undersigned from the collection of the debts or any of them shall be received in trust for the Bank.\nIn the year 1955 the contractor was engaged in the construction under various contracts of nine buildings, including the one in question.\nThe contractor was from time to time a borrower from the bank and these borrowings were secured by the general assignment of book debts above referred to, a guarantee by the president of the company, and the deposit of certain securities as to the nature of which we are not concerned.\nBy reason of the provisions of s. 11 of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 227, the County of Lambton was required to retain 15 per cent of the value of the work, service and material done, placed or furnished by the contractor, and this was done. The work having been completed, upon the expiry of the time limited by that section the county, at the solicitation of the contractor, delivered to it a cheque payable to the contractor\u2019s order for $77,000 which bore on its face the notation \u201cPayment on Contract.\u201d That cheque was endorsed in blank by the contractor and deposited on March 1, 1956, in its current account with the respondent, in accordance with its obligations under the assignment. The cheque did not represent the entire amount held back by the county but the evidence is lacking as to the disposition that was made of the balance.\nNo notice had been given by the respondent to the County of Lambton that the account owing to it by the contractor had been assigned to it, which, no doubt, accounts for the fact that the contractor was named as the payee of the cheque. By virtue of the provisions of s. 3 of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act the sum received by the contractor constituted a trust fund in its hands for the benefit, inter alia, of the appellants who had performed services or done work upon the premises, that section declaring, inter alia, that the contractor shall be:\nthe trustee of all such sums so received by him, and until all workmen and all persons who have supplied material on the contract and all subcontractors are paid for work done or material supplied on the contract\u2026may not appropriate or convert any part thereof to his own use or to any use not authorized by the trust.\nThe appellants contended before the learned trial judge that the moneys received by the respondent from the County of Lambton, in payment of the cheque, were so received by it qua assignee of the contractor and that, in such capacity, the moneys in its hands were impressed with the same trust as that imposed upon it in the hands of the contractor.\nWells J., who found against the appellants, was of the opinion that, since no notice of the assignment of book accounts had been given by the respondent to the County of Lambton and the cheque had been deposited to the contractor\u2019s credit in the ordinary course of business, the moneys were not subject to the trust in the hands of the bank.\nIn the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal[6], delivered by the Chief Justice of Ontario, no mention is made of this assignment and its bearing upon the question of the appellants\u2019 rights was, apparently, not considered. In the reasons delivered by the late Mr. Justice Morden the fact of the making of the assignment is mentioned, but the effect of that fact upon the legal rights of the parties is not discussed.\nThe facts to be considered in disposing of the issue are undisputed. By virtue of the assignment of September 9, 1952, the moneys owing by the County of Lambton to the contractor on the completion of the work were, as between the contractor and the bank, the property of the bank. When the cheque was issued payable to the contractor in satisfaction of part of that debt, it was received by it as trustee for the bank, subject to the statutory trust attaching to the moneys under the provisions of s. 3 of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act. The contractor qua trustee was obligated to transfer the cheque to the bank, which was done by endorsement and delivery. The right of the respondent to retain the moneys realized from the cheque was not as holder in due course of that instrument, but as owner of the debt due by the county to the contractor which had been assigned to it. The fact that no notice of the assignment of book debts had been given to the county is aside from the point. The question is merely one of determining in what manner as between the bank and its customer it became entitled to these moneys.\nAs pointed out by Rand J. in delivering the judgment of the majority of this Court in Minneapolis\u2011Honeywell Regulator Co. Ltd. v. Empire Brass Mfg. Co. Ltd.[7], sub-contractors and workmen may not be deprived of the charge in their favour upon moneys in the hands of the principal contractor by the simple expedient of assigning those moneys to someone else. The respondent\u2019s claim to these moneys is qua assignee and they were received by it, in my opinion, subject to the statutory trust in favour of the appellants by virtue of s. 3 of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act.\nMuch stress has been laid in the argument before us upon the fact that no notice of the assignment of book accounts had been given to the County of Lambton, that the deposit of the cheque was made in the ordinary course of business and that an examination of the contractor\u2019s account with the bank discloses this, that the bank manager did not know that the sub-contractors were unpaid, that the bank had no notice that the contractor was in financial difficulties and that the manager did not know that, in failing to pay the claims of the appellants out of the moneys to be realized from the cheque given by the county, the contractor was committing a breach of trust and acting in a manner contrary to the prohibition in s. 3, which is above quoted.\nAssuming all these facts to be proven by the evidence, with the greatest respect for the learned judges who have upheld the claim of the respondent and for those in this Court who have contrary views, none of them are relevant or have any bearing on the question to be decided, in my opinion. Had the County of Lambton paid to the contractor the sum of $77,000 in currency instead of by cheque, the money would have been, in its hands, impressed with a trust in favour of, inter alia, the sub\u2011contractors and, until they were paid, the contractor would have been prohibited from converting it to its own use. When the money was so received by the contractor it would have been held by it, by virtue of s. 5 of The Assignment of Book Debts Act, in trust for the bank, subject to what is, in effect, a statutory lien. Would any one seriously suggest in these circumstances that, had the currency then been paid over by the contractor to its cestui que trust, the bank, as would have been its duty by reason of\u2014and only by reason of\u2014the assignment, it would be freed of this lien or charge? The right of the sub-contractors is not \u201can equitable right\u201d as has been suggested. It is a statutory right conferred by s. 3.\nHow then is the situation altered when the county paid the $77,000 by cheque? That cheque and the moneys realized from it were subject to the same charge and, unless the bank should attempt to support its claim on the ground that it became holder in due course of the cheque\u2014and no such insupportable claim has been advanced on its behalf\u2014the situation would, of necessity, be exactly the same as if the amount had been paid in currency. It is perhaps unnecessary to point out that, but for the assignment of book debts, the contractor, after satisfying the claims of the sub-contractors, could have used the moneys for its own purposes and deposited it elsewhere. But as between the contractor and the bank the latter was the cestui que trust, the former merely holding the cheque on its behalf. Since as between the contractor and the bank the cause of action in respect of which the cheque was given was the property of the bank, the latter could not attain the position of the holder in due course of the cheque as defined by s. 56 of the Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 15, for obvious reasons.\nWhile the facts in the Minneapolis-Honeywell case differed from those in the present matter, the statement of Rand J. to which I have above referred is, in my opinion, directly applicable.\nThe decisive point in the case is that as between the contractor and the bank the cheque and the moneys realized from it, subject to the statutory trust created by s. 3 of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act for the benefit of workmen, supply men and sub-contractors, were the property of the bank, and the endorsement and delivery of the cheque merely passed the legal title to it.\nThe fallacy of the proposition that by failing to notify the County of Lambton of the assignment and requiring it to pay the moneys directly to the bank, or by failing to expressly require the contractor to endorse the cheque to it under the assignment, the sub-contractors may be deprived of their statutory rights appears to me to be demonstrated by stating it.\nIt was contended before us that s. 3 of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act was ultra vires the Legislature of Ontario. As to this, it is sufficient to say that, in my view, the right to so legislate is undoubted under head 13 of s. 92 of the British North America Act. The legislative power to impose a lien upon the land by The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act extends, in my judgment, to declaring that, in addition, there is a charge upon the moneys in the hands of the contractor.\nI would allow this appeal and direct that the respondent account to the appellants for the amounts of their respective claims, together with interest at the legal rate in the case of the appellant John M.M. Troup Ltd. from the date upon which the demand for payment was made by its solicitors on its behalf, and in the case of the appellant National Painting and Decorating Ltd. from the date of the issue of the writ. I would allow the appellants their costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The relevant facts are set out in the reasons of other members of the Court. While endeavouring to avoid repetition I wish to refer shortly to some of the findings made in the courts below.\nThe manager of the respondent\u2019s branch at Brampton stated that he was familiar with the terms of s. 11 of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act requiring the owner to retain 15 per cent of the value of the work done for a period of 37 days after the completion of the work but that he was not aware of the provisions of s. 3 of the Act constituting sums paid to a contractor a trust fund for the benefit of sub-contractors and others. However, the case was dealt with in the courts below and argued before us on the assumption that knowledge of the terms of s. 3 should be imputed to the manager, and it is unnecessary to consider whether his ignorance in fact of the terms of that section might otherwise have been relevant.\nThe following findings of fact made by the learned trial judge appear to me to be fundamental:\nIn my opinion, on a fair valuation of the evidence there is no evidence to show that any of these moneys were ever paid in to the defendant bank by virtue of the general assignment of book debts which the bank took from the Construction Company. It is quite clear I think, that no notice was ever given of the assignment by the bank to anyone or that it ever relied on the general assignment or acted on it. While it was taken at an early stage, it was never used or acted upon.\n* * *\nIt is also argued on behalf of the plaintiffs that there is here a trust which the bank manager at Brampton had knowledge of and that his knowledge was the knowledge of the bank. In my view, the evidence falls very far short of establishing anything of the sort.\n* * *\nThe moneys (scil. the cheque for $77,000) were unquestionably deposited by the Construction Company in the ordinary course of business in their account and the bank, which at that time had no question in its mind as to the solvency of that Company, went on paying the cheques of the Construction Company and in fact, raised the overdraft. As I have already indicated, there was no suggestion at this time that the bank had any knowledge of the accounts of the plaintiff which are the subject of this action.\nIn the reasons of the majority in the Court of Appeal delivered by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario the first of the three findings of the learned trial judge set out above is not dealt with but, in my view, that finding is supported by the evidence and is clearly right. The second and third findings are concurred in by Porter C.J.O.\nThe late Mr. Justice Morden, in his dissenting judgment, quoted at length from the evidence of the manager and reached the conclusion which he expressed as follows:\nThis evidence makes it abundantly clear that the bank knew that the $77,051.84 was part of the hold-back and that at the time it was deposited and set-off by it against the contractor\u2019s indebtedness to it, subcontractors were unpaid.\nThere is no doubt that the manager knew that the cheque for $77,000 was part of the hold\u2011back but, with the greatest respect, after reading all the evidence, I am unable to agree with the finding that at the time the cheque was deposited the manager knew that sub-contractors were unpaid. I agree with the view which Porter C.J.O. summarized in the following passage:\nThe test to be applied is whether the Bank manager knew that the customer was committing a breach of trust and he knowingly participated therein. In my view it has not been clearly demonstrated on the evidence that to the knowledge of the Bank manager there were unpaid accounts of workmen and for supplies or that they would not be paid. The evidence in this case is clear that at all material times he did not know and therefore could not have participated in any breach of trust.\nThe law applicable to this branch of the matter is, in my opinion, accurately stated in the following passages in Underhill on Trusts, 11th ed., 1959, at pp. 565 and 566:\nWhere, however, a trustee has overdrawn his banking account, his bankers have a first and paramount lien on all moneys paid in if they have no notice that they are trust moneys; for where the equities are equal the law prevails, and, in the case supposed, the bankers have in point of law received the money in payment of their debt.\nand at p. 606:\nSo, as has been already stated, where a trustee has overdrawn his banking account, his bankers have a first and paramount legal lien on all moneys paid in by him, unless they have notice, not only that they are trust moneys, but also that the payment to them constitutes a breach of trust.\nFor the reasons given by my brother Judson I agree with his conclusion that the bank had no notice, actual or constructive, of any breach of trust committed by the construction company, subject only to one argument put forward on behalf of the appellants which remains to be considered.\nThis argument is based on the existence of the assignment of book debts. Reliance is placed particularly on para. 5 of the assignment which reads:\nAll moneys received by the undersigned from the collection of the debts or any of them shall be received in trust for the Bank.\nThere is no doubt that the debt owing by the County of Lambton to the construction company, in part payment of which the cheque for $77,000 was delivered, was covered by the assignment in the sense that the bank, had it seen fit to do so, could have given notice to the county to make payment to it instead of to the construction company, or could have called upon the construction company (if that company had retained the proceeds of the cheque instead of endorsing and delivering it to the bank) to account to it for the proceeds of the cheque as being trust moneys in its hands to which the bank was beneficially entitled. It is equally clear that the bank did not follow either of these courses and that the county, the construction company and the bank all acted in the transaction without reference to, and probably without any thought of, the existence of the assignment.\nIt is argued that, (i) although the bank gave no notice of the assignment to anyone and did not at any time seek to enforce or make use of it, the assignment was none the less an existing and valid instrument which by its express terms created the relationship of trustee and cestui que trust between the construction company and the bank, (ii) that the construction company received the $77,000 from the county as trustee for the bank, (iii) that as trustee for the bank it was also agent for the bank, (iv) that the construction company knew that the accounts of the two plaintiffs were unpaid and that consequently the $77,000 was, by virtue of s. 3 of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, impressed with a trust in their favour, (v) that notice to its agent or trustee was in law notice to the bank and (vi) that, therefore, when the bank acquired the legal title to the $77,000 it did so with notice of the trust in favour of the plaintiffs and must account to them for the amount of the debts due to them.\nThis argument, if valid, would destroy the bank\u2019s defence that when it obtained the legal title to the $77,000 it did so without notice of the beneficial interests of the plaintiffs therein. Among the authorities on which the appellants rely in support of this argument are the case of Minneapolis\u2011Honeywell Regulator Co. Ltd. v. Empire Brass Mfg. Co. Ltd.[8], and the following passage in Scott on Trusts, 2nd ed., vol. 3, pp. 2231 and 2232:\nIn considering whether a transferee of trust property has notice that the transfer is in breach of trust, the general principles of agency are applicable. Thus if a third person purchases trust property through an agent, the purchaser is chargeable with notice that the trustee is committing a breach of trust in making the sale if the agent has such notice.\nThe Minneapolis-Honeywell case is distinguishable on the facts. The judgment proceeds on the view that the respondent had notice of the appellant\u2019s claim. Rand J. with whom Kellock, Estey and Fauteux JJ. agreed said in part at p. 698:\nThe respondent, knowing all the facts, was therefore properly found liable as for a breach of trust.\nRand J. adopted the statement of the facts contained in the reasons of Locke J. who reached the same result. Locke J. said, at pp. 700 and 701:\nUpon obtaining this assignment the respondent gave notice of it to the general contractors and thereafter payments by the general contractors, other than those for small amounts, were made by cheques made payable jointly to the respondent and the sub-contractor. These payments included the entire amounts payable to the sub\u2011contractor on its contracts for the four schools mentioned, which included the automatic heat control system supplied and installed by the appellant at the request of the sub-contractor. By virtue of the manner in which these payments were made, the respondent obtained what amounted to complete control over the financial operations of the sub\u2011contractor. When cheques payable to their joint order were received, it was necessary for the sub-contractor to obtain the consent of the respondent to the payment of any sums, other than the small amounts referred to which do not enter into the matter, to its other creditors.\nand at p. 705:\nThe claim of the respondent to moneys payable by the contractor to the sub-contractor depended entirely on the terms of the written assignment of February 4, 1950.\nThis case does not appear to me to be of assistance in the case at bar in which I have already expressed my agreement with the concurrent findings of fact in the Courts below that the bank obtained legal title to the $77,000 without notice of the equitable rights of the plaintiffs, unless it can be said, as is argued by the appellants, that because of the terms of para. 5 of the assignment the notice of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims which the construction company undoubtedly had must be imputed to the bank.\nThe answer to this argument of imputed notice appears to me to be that made by the learned trial judge in the passage from his reasons firstly quoted above. When the $77,000 was deposited in the overdrawn account neither the bank nor the construction company was acting in pursuance of the assignment, they were acting not as assignee and assignor or as cestui que trust and trustee but as banker and customer in the ordinary course of business. It appears that the cheque was endorsed by the construction company and handed to the bank with a deposit slip directing the bank to credit it to the construction company\u2019s account, and this was done. At the moment of deposit in point of law the money was received by the bank in part payment of its customer\u2019s debt. The argument that the bank received it qua assignee or qua cestui que trust appears to me to fail on the facts. Neither the county nor the plaintiffs were aware of or parties to the assignment; the only parties to it were the bank and the construction company and so long as the former saw fit to refrain from acting upon it I am unable to see how the mere fact of its existence could improve the position of the plaintiffs. In view of the manner in which the dealings between the bank and the construction company were carried on the existence of the assignment appears to me to be irrelevant.\nIf, contrary to the view I have just expressed, it should be held that the $77,000 was paid by the construction company in the capacity of agent or trustee and was received by the bank in the capacity of principal or cestui que trust it would be necessary to consider whether on the facts the case falls not within the general rule that notice to an agent is notice to his principal but within the exception illustrated by the decision in Cave v. Cave[9], in which it was held that knowledge of an agent will not be imputed to his principal where the agent is party to a fraud of which the principal is ignorant and innocent and which would be exposed if the agent communicated the notice to his principal. However, as, in my view, on the facts of the case at bar this question does not arise I do not pursue it.\nI do not find it necessary to express an opinion on the constitutional points which were so fully and ably argued before us.\nFor the reasons given by my brother Judson and those stated above I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nSince writing these reasons I have had the opportunity of reading those of my brother Martland; I agree with them and wish to found my judgment upon them as well as on what I have said above. The judgment of Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nMARTLAND J.:\u2014I agree with the reasons given by my brothers Cartwright and Judson, and wish only to make some comment regarding the effect of the general assignment of debts.\nThe evidence makes it clear that the money which came into the respondent\u2019s hands was not received by it by the operation of that assignment. Although registered, no notice of the assignment was given to anyone. The County of Lambton was unaware of it, and did not pay the money owing to Town and Country Construction Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe contractor\u201d) to the respondent, but directly to the contractor. The debt had been paid before the money came into the respondent\u2019s hands from the contractor.\nThe assignment contained in clause (5) a covenant by the contractor that: \u201cAll moneys received by the undersigned (the contractor) from the collection of the debts or any of them shall be received in trust for the Bank.\u201d The application of that covenant in the present case would mean that, upon receipt of the money paid to it by the County of Lambton, the contractor would become trustee of the money for the benefit of the respondent.\nAt the same time, by virtue of the operation of s. 3 of The Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 227, the contractor became a trustee of the same money for the benefit of unpaid sub\u2011contractors, etc. This section does not purport to do more than to create a trust for the benefit of the class named in it. It does not create a statutory lien upon the sums received by a contractor. It makes him a trustee of that fund. Although the trust is created by statute, it thereupon becomes subject to the application of the rules of equity applicable to trusts.\nThe situation which arose upon the contractor\u2019s receipt of the money, paid by the County of Lambton, was that he had become trustee thereof for competing beneficiaries; i.e., the appellants, as sub\u2011contractors, pursuant to s. 3 of the Act, and the respondent, by virtue of clause (5) of its assignment. At that stage there were two competing equities and, while the money remained in the contractor\u2019s hands, I have no doubt that the appellants had the superior claim. However, the matter did not end there. The contractor, who had an overdraft with the respondent, paid the money into his bank account. The respondent received the deposit in good faith and gave value for it. A study of the evidence satisfies me that the finding of Porter C.J.O. is correct when he said that the evidence did not demonstrate that the bank manager knew there were unpaid accounts of workmen and for supplies when the money was received by the respondent and that he did not know of any breach of trust by the contractor.\nWhat has occurred, therefore, is that the respondent, which initially had only an equitable right, subordinate to that of the appellants, has acquired legal title to the money, bona fide, for value, without notice of any breach of trust on the part of the contractor. The proposition stated in Underhill on Trusts, 11th ed., 1959, at p. 606, cited by my brother Cartwright, is applicable; i.e.,\nSo, as has been already stated, where a trustee has overdrawn his banking account, his bankers have a first and paramount legal lien on all moneys paid, in by him, unless they have notice, not only that they are trust moneys, but also that the payment to them constitutes a breach of trust.\nThe fact that the respondent had, itself, previously had an equitable interest in the money cannot, in my view, alter the application of this principle, so long as it was unaware that, by paying the money to it, the contractor was committing a breach of trust.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, LOCKE J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Furlong & Furlong, Windsor.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: McMillan, Binch, Stuart, Berry, Dunn, Corrigan & Howland, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General for Ontario: E.R.

Subsequently the three letters were discovered to have been opened and the accused was found in possession of the money. She was convicted of stealing \u201canything sent by post, after it is deposited at a post office and before it is delivered\u201d contrary to s. 298(1) (a) (i) of the Criminal Code. The Court of Appeal substituted a conviction of simple theft and varied the sentence. The Crown appealed to this Court to have the conviction at trial restored, and at the hearing the accused was allowed to apply for leave to appeal against the substituted conviction.\nHeld (Taschereau and Cartwright JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the conviction for the offence as charged restored.\nPer Fauteux, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The letters were sent through and by means of activities conducted under the direction of the Postmaster General, and as such were sent by post within the meaning of s. 298(1)(a). The intention of the sender could not be a determining factor in deciding whether or not these letters were \u201csent by post\u201d within the meaning of the section, and as the expression \u201cpost letter\u201d has been dropped from the Criminal Code, the question of whether or not a \u201cpost letter\u201d is necessarily a letter \u201csent by post\u201d could not affect the interpretation to be placed on the section. It is true that the intention was to have them taken out of the mail, but if they had been missed, and had gone as addressed, they undoubtedly would have been sent \u201cby post\u201d in the colloquial sense of these words as well as in the special meaning assigned to them by the Post Office Act. Whether the intention to have them removed from the post had been carried out or not could not alter the fact that when they were opened and their contents stolen, they were passing through the hands of a person who was then engaged in the activities of the Canada Post Office and they were so passing because the investigator had sent them by that route. Per Taschereau and Cartwright JJ., dissenting: It is only after it has been established that something has been \u201csent\u201d that the question can arise whether it was \u201csent by post\u201d. In the case at bar nothing has been \u201csent\u201d. Three requisites are required to render the use of that word appropriate: (i) a sender, (ii) an object to be sent, and (iii) a destination to which the object is to be sent. In this case although there was an object to be sent, it would be a distortion of the meaning of a plain English word to say that the letters were sent by anyone or were sent anywhere.\nPer Curiam: As to the appeal against the substituted charge, it did not lie without leave since it did not raise any question of law on which a judge of the Court of Appeal had dissented, and leave to appeal ought not to be granted.\nAPPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], substituting a conviction on a charge of theft for a conviction on a charge of stealing from the mail. Appeal allowed, Taschereau and Cartwright JJ. dissenting.\nF.L. Wilson, for the appellant.\nJ.A. Hoolihan, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Cartwright JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):\u2014The facts out of which this appeal arises are set out in the reasons of my brother Ritchie.\nI have reached the conclusion that the appeal fails. I am in full agreement with the reasons of the majority in the Court of Appeal1, delivered by Roach J.A. and concurred in by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, but, in view of the differences of opinion in the Court of Appeal and in this Court, I propose to add a few words.\nThe wording of the information on which the respondent was convicted is as follows:\nthat Cora Cumming on the 25th day of January in the year 1961 at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, in the County of York, unlawfully did steal the contents of three letters, to wit: three one dollar bills, the property of the Post Master General of Canada, the letters having been sent by post, and after they had been deposited at a post office and before they were delivered.\nThere is no doubt that the respondent stole the three one dollar bills. The question is whether the letters from which she took them had been sent by post. If they were sent by post there is no doubt that the theft occurred before they were delivered; they were never delivered and there was no intention that they should be.\nIn the case at bar the question is of importance because if the contents of the letters were sent by post the respondent, upon conviction, was, under s. 298(1) of the Criminal Code, liable to imprisonment for a maximum term of ten years and to a compulsory minimum term of six months, whereas if they were not sent by post she was, under s. 280(b), liable to a maximum term of two years and no minimum term was prescribed.\nThe only rule of construction to which reference need be made is that stated by Baron Parke in Perry v. Skinner[2]:\nThe rule by which we are to be guided in construing Acts of Parliament is to look at the precise words, and to construe them in their ordinary sense, unless it would lead to any absurdity or manifest injustice; and if it should, so to vary and modify them as to avoid that which it certainly could not have been the intention of the legislature should be done.\nThe word of crucial importance in the information and in s. 298(1) (a) (i) is \u201csent\u201d. The transitive verb \u201csend\u201d of which it is the past participle is a word the plain and ordinary meaning of which is so well known that there is no need to refer to dictionaries, but it may be observed that the meaning given in the Concise Oxford Dictionary is \u201csecure conveyance of to some destination (destination given by to or other preposition or by indirect object, or merely implied)\u201d. To render the use of the word appropriate there are three requisites, (i) a sender, (ii) an object to be sent, and (iii) a destination to which the object is to be sent. In the case at bar we have the second of these, the contents of the three letters, but the first and the third are lacking. In my respectful opinion, it is a distortion of the meaning of a plain English word to say that the letters were sent by anyone or were sent anywhere. Suppose the facts of the case were recited and the question were put: \u201cBy whom and to what destination were the three letters sent?\u201d Can it be doubted that the same answer would be made by the man in the street as by the meticulous philologist: \u201cNo one sent them anywhere; they were placed in the tray to test the honesty of the sorter.\u201d It is only after it has been established that something has been sent that the question can arise whether it was sent by post; and, in the case at bar, nothing has been sent.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nCounsel for the respondent in addition to arguing that the appeal should be dismissed sought to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in so far as it ordered that a conviction on a charge of theft be substituted for the conviction of an offence under s. 298(1) (a) (i) of the Criminal Code. On this branch of the matter I agree with my brother Ritchie that the proposed appeal does not lie without leave and that leave to appeal ought not to be granted.\nThe judgment of Fauteux, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario[3] from which Mr. Justice MacKay dissented, which allowed the appeal of the respondent from a conviction for stealing the contents of three letters,\n\u2026the property of the Post Master General of Canada, the letters having been sent by post, and after they had been deposited at a post office and before they were delivered\u2026\nThe judgment now appealed from substituted a conviction on \u201ca charge of theft\u201d and varied the sentence imposed by the magistrate from a period of six months to one of three months\u2019 imprisonment.\nThe evidence, which is uncontradicted, discloses that the respondent was on duty in her capacity as a sorter of mail in the city delivery branch of the Toronto Post Office on the evening of January 25, 1961, when three envelopes bearing cancelled stamps, addressed to the Canadian National Telegraphs and each containing some coins and a $1 bill were introduced, on instructions from Post Office investigators, amongst other letters placed before her for sorting. These envelopes which had been prepared by the investigators, who had inserted the $1 bills after making a note of their serial numbers, were taken to the supervisor of the sortation unit in which the respondent worked by investigator Allen who gave certain instructions as a result of which the supervisor placed the envelopes in a tray of ordinary mail to be sorted and then saw to it that this tray was placed in front of the respondent who was kept under supervision while she sorted it, after which it was taken directly to the supervisor\u2019s office where the same investigator, Allen, extracted the three envelopes and found that they had been opened and the $1 bills removed. The bills were later found in the respondent\u2019s possession and there is no doubt that they were removed from the envelopes by her.\nIt is apparent from the evidence that these envelopes were prepared and mingled with the mail for the sole purpose of testing the honesty of the respondent, and that the investigators did not intend that they would ever leave the Post Office building. The only question to be determined is whether, under these circumstances, it can be said that the envelopes were letters \u201csent by post\u201d within the meaning of s. 298(1) of the Criminal Code, the relevant portions of which read:\n298. (1) Every one who\n(a) steals\n(i) anything sent by post, after it is deposited at a post office and before it is delivered,\n* * *\nis guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for ten years and, where the offence is committed under paragraph (a), to imprisonment for not less than six months.\nThe point at issue is stated in the factum of the appellant in the following terms:\nWhether a letter is sent by post within the meaning of section 298(1) (a) (i) when the sender does not intend the letter to be delivered to the addressee and the letter is handed by the sender to the supervisor of sorters to be placed in the course of post.\nThe history of legislation having to do with theft of letters or their contents from the mails in Canada discloses that from the enactment of the Criminal Code in 1892 (s. 327) until the coming into force of the present Criminal Code in 1955 the offence was described as stealing \u201ca post letter\u201d or \u201cfrom or out of a post letter\u201d, and the definition of \u201cpost letter\u201d in the Post Office Act was originally limited to letters \u201cto be transmitted or delivered through the post\u201d. Similarly, under the English Post Office Act (1837), 1 Vict., c. 36, a \u201cpost letter\u201d was confined to any letter or packet \u201ctransmitted by the post under the authority of the Postmaster General\u201d, and in the cases of Regina v. Rathbone[4] and Regina v. Shepherd[5], decoy letters employed in much the same manner as they were in the present case were held not to be \u201cpost letters\u201d within the meaning of this definition because they were not introduced into the mail in the ordinary way for transmission by post.\nThe definition of \u201cpost letter\u201d in the Canadian Post Office Act was broadened by c. 19 of the Statutes of Canada (1901) whereby it was enacted that the expression meant, inter alia, \u201cany letter. deposited in any post office\u2026whether it is intended for transmission by post or delivery through the post or not.\u201d It was under this statute that the Ontario Court of Appeal decided in the case of Rex v. Ryan[6] that a decoy letter intended for the testing of a postman\u2019s honesty was a \u201cpost letter\u201d.\nHowever, when all reference to \u201cpost letter\u201d was omitted from the present Code, the offence became stealing \u201canything sent by post after it is deposited in a post office and before it is delivered\u201d, and it is contended on behalf of the respondent that the expression \u201csent by post\u201d as used in this context cannot apply to the envelopes in question on the ground that, like the letters in Regina v. Rathbone, supra, and Regina v. Shepherd, supra, they were not introduced into the Post Office in the ordinary way for the purpose of transmission by post.\nThis latter reasoning appears to me to leave out of account the definitions of \u201csend by post\u201d and \u201cCanada Post Office\u201d which were introduced in to the Post Office Act by c. 57 of the Statutes of Canada (1951) and which control the meaning of the words \u201csent by post\u201d as used in s. 298(1) of the Criminal Code (see s. 3(5) of the Criminal Code). Subsection 2(1) (o) and 2(1) (a) of the Post Office Act now read as follows:\n2. (1) (o) \u201csend by post\u201d or \u201ctransmit by post\u201d means to send by, through or by means of the Canada Post Office;\n2. (1) (a) \u201cCanada Post Office\u201d means the activities conducted under the direction and control of the Postmaster General; It is to be noted that under the Post Office Act the Postmaster General is required to operate, and empowered to regulate the operation of, a \u201cpost office\u201d which term includes, inter alia, any room or building for \u201csortation, handling or despatch of mail\u201d (see ss. 5(1)(a), 6(h) and 2(1) (i) of the Post Office Act).\nThe basis of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in respect of the question here at issue appears to me to be epitomized in the following paragraph of the decision rendered by Roach J.A. on behalf of the majority of that Court:\nI can say at once also that, in my respectful opinion, while every letter that is \u201csent by post\u201d is a \u201cpost letter\u201d, the converse is not true, that is to say, every post letter is not necessarily a letter \u201csent by post\u201d. In my respectful opinion, a letter is \u201csent by post\u201d when the sender deposits it in a \u201cpost office\u201d as defined in sec. 2(1) (i) of the Post Office Act, with the intention that it shall be conveyed or transported by means of the Canada Post Office to the person to whom it is being sent. It is not \u201csent by post\u201d when, as here, it is placed somewhere in the post office by a post office official under such circumstances that he has it in his power and intends to intercept it so that it shall not be delivered to the person to whom it is addressed. In those circumstances it seems clear to me that the letter is not being sent to anyone; it is being retained under the control of the person who deposited it. In the instant case, the investigators did not send these three letters to the Canadian National Telegraph Company. They were decoy letters which they pretended had been \u201csent by post\u201d. If they had been \u201csent by post\u201d within the meaning of the Act the inspectors would have had no right to interfere with or prevent their transmission; Section 41 Post Office Act. The fact that they did retrieve them shows that they did not regard them as being in the course of post, that is \u201csent by post\u201d.\nWith the greatest respect, I am unable to adopt the view that the intention of the sender can be a determining factor in deciding whether or not these envelopes were \u201csent by post\u201d within the meaning of s. 298(1) (a), and as the expression \u201cpost letter\u201d had been dropped from the Criminal Code I do not think that the question of whether or not a \u201cpost letter\u201d is necessarily a letter \u201csent by post\u201d can affect the interpretation to be placed on that section.\nSpeaking of the envelopes in question, one of the Post Office investigators, in the course of his evidence, after having agreed that the intention was to have them taken out of the mail in any event, went on to say, \u201cbut if they had missed them, they would go as addressed.\u201d If these envelopes had been \u201cmissed\u201d and had gone \u201cas addressed\u201d, it appears to me that they would undoubtedly have been sent \u201cby post\u201d in the colloquial sense of these words as well as in the special meaning assigned to them by the Post Office Act irrespective of the fact that the sender had never intended the addressee to receive them. I am unable to see how the fact that they were not \u201cmissed\u201d can change their character in this regard.\nThese envelopes were sent by a Post Office investigator through a sortation unit of the Toronto Post Office for the purpose of testing the honesty of one of the sorters, and whether his intention to have them removed from the post before they reached the addressee had been carried out or not could not alter the fact that when they were opened and their contents stolen they were passing through the hands of a person who was then engaged in the activities of the Canada Post Office and that they were so passing because the investigator had sent them by that route. In my opinion, therefore, the envelopes were sent through and by means of activities conducted under the direction of the Postmaster General, and as such they were sent by post within the meaning of s. 298(1) (a).\nThe respondent also entered an appeal which raised questions based on the contention that there was no evidence that the envelopes in question were \u201cthe property of the Postmaster General of Canada\u201d from whom the Information alleges that they were stolen. In my opinion, however, the appeal so entered must be quashed as it does not raise any question of law on which a judge of the Court of Appeal has dissented (see s. 597 of the Criminal Code). At the hearing of this appeal counsel on behalf of the respondent was allowed to apply for leave so to appeal, but there does not appear to me to be any ground for granting that application.\nFor the above reasons, I would allow this appeal and restore the conviction for the offence as charged in the Information.\nAppeal allowed, TASCHEREAU and CARTWRIGHT JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitor, for the appellant: E.R.

It merely indicated how the Minister should exercise his responsibility of managing and controlling a public work entrusted to him by statute.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, restoring the conviction of the appellant for illegally operating a taxi service within an airport. Appeal dismissed.\nL. P. Pigeon, Q.C., for the appellant.\nR. B\u00e9dard, Q.C., and G. C\u00f4t\u00e9, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Abbott, Martland, and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014Appellant, a taxicab operator in Sept-Iles, on October 14, 1958, was convicted by a district Magistrate of having ill\u00e9galement, le ou vers le 3 mai 1958 exploit\u00e9 \u00e0 Sept-\u00celes, district de Saguenay, sans autorisation \u00e9crite du Ministre des Transports \u00e0 cet effet un v\u00e9hicule commercial \u00e0 voyageurs sur l'a\u00e9roport de Sept-\u00celes, propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la Couronne du Chef du Canada en transportant contre r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration des voyageurs au moyen d'un auto-taxi, le tout contrairement \u00e0 l'article 4-A du r\u00e8glement concernant le contr\u00f4le des v\u00e9hicules sur les a\u00e9roports \u00e9dict\u00e9 par le d\u00e9cret C.P. 1953-942 et de ses amendements \u00e0 date, C.P. 1955-1443 et C.P. 1956-1666, se rendant ainsi passible des peines pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l'article 22 dudit r\u00e8glement.\nHe was condemned to pay a fine of $5 and costs.\nThe Superior Court for the District of Saguenay, sitting in appeal, and in a trial de novo pursuant to s. 719 et seq. of the Criminal Code, quashed the conviction. Upon appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench2, the appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. Leave to appeal from that judgment was granted by this Court.\nThe facts are not in dispute. The sole question in issue is one of law, namely, whether certain provisions contained in an Order-in-Council concerning the operation of commercial passenger vehicles within airports under the administration and control of the Minister of Transport, are within the scope of the legislative authority conferred upon the Governor-in-Council by Parliament.\nThe provisions in question are contained in the \"Airport Vehicle Control Regulations\", established by Order-in-Council P.C. 1953-942 as amended by P.C. 1955-1443 and P.C. 1956-1666, s. 4A, of which reads:\n4-A (1) No person shall, without the authority in writing of the Minister,\n(a) carry on any business on an airport relating to the renting or otherwise providing of commercial passenger vehicles, or\n(b) except as provided in subsection (2) operate a commercial passenger vehicle on an airport.\n(2) A commercial passenger vehicle may be operated within an airport, without authority in writing by the Minister, for the purpose of carrying passengers\n(a) from a place outside the airport to a place inside the airport; or\n(b) on a trip originating within the airport, pursuant to arrangements made prior to the arrival of the vehicle at the airport.\nThe Sept-Iles airport is a civil airport and is the property of the Crown in the right of Canada. In addition to landing strips and surrounding land together with buildings, plant and machinery, access roads leading from the landing strips and buildings to public roads outside the property are provided by the Crown.\nThe Court below held\u2014and in my respectful view held correctly\u2014that authority for the provisions contained in s. 4A of the Airport Vehicle Control Regulations, is to be found in the Department of Transport Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 79, and in particular in s. 25 of that Act which reads:\n25. The Governor in Council may from time to time make such regulations as he deems necessary for the management, maintenance, proper use and protection of all or any of the canals or other works under the management or control of the Minister, and for the ascertaining and collection of the tolls, dues and revenue thereon.\nThe airport at Sept-Iles is clearly a work \"under the management or control\" of the Minister of Transport. Section 3(c) of the Aeronautics Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 2, provides that it is the duty of the Minister\nto construct and maintain all Government aerodromes and air stations, including all plant, machinery and buildings necessary for their efficient equipment and upkeep;\nAs Mr. Justice Hyde has pointed out in the Court below, the vehicular approaches within an airport are properly subject to control in the interests of proper management and have not the full character of public highways upon which the public has the right to pass and repass. The management of an airport, in the interest both of the Crown and of the public, may well require a limitation and control of many kinds of commercial activities within its boundaries, including the regulation of taxi services. The operation of a taxi service is clearly a commercial activity, is so defined in s. 2 of the Airport Vehicle Control Regulations above referred to and, in my opinion, the regulation of commercial activity within an airport clearly comes within the meaning of \"management, proper use and protection\" of such airport.\nThe Governor-in-Council exercising the powers given in the statute, established the Airport Vehicle Control Regulations which provide for the control of all vehicular traffic using an airport and which limit such use by commercial vehicles. Under these Regulations the Minister of Transport is given discretion and authority to determine, among other matters, what persons shall be allowed to \"carry on any business on an airport relating to the renting or otherwise providing of commercial vehicles\". The granting of such authority to the Minister by Order-in-Council is not a delegation of legislative authority. It merely indicates how the Minister shall exercise his responsibility of managing and controlling the public work entrusted to him by the statute.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nFauteux J.:\u2014I agree with my brother Abbott whose reasons I had the advantage to read. I only wish to point out some of the reasons why the decision of this Court in City of Verdun v. Sun Oil Co. Ltd.3, strongly relied on by appellant in support of the contention that s. 4A of the Airport Vehicle Control Regulations is ultra vires of the Governor-in-Council, has here no application.\nPurporting to implement its statutory authority to restrict by a zoning by-law the right of land-owners to use their property as they see fit, the City of Verdun did, by the provision impugned in that case, transform that authority into a mere administrative and discretionary power to cancel by resolution a right which, untrammelled in the absence of any by-law, could only be regulated in a proper one. For that reason, the provision was declared ultra vires of the City.\nThe situation here is entirely different. The right to carry on a private business on airports which are the property of the Crown in the right of Canada is vested in no one. The Crown may find it expedient to grant this right to any one under such terms and conditions as may be found appropriate. By the statutory provisions referred to in the reasons of my brother Abbott, Parliament authorizes the Governor-in-Council to make such regulations as the latter deems necessary for, inter alia, the management, proper use and protection of airports which are under the management or control of the Minister of Transport. Pursuant to this authority, the Governor-in-Council adopted the Airport Vehicle Control Regulations, of which s. 4A provides that no person shall, without the authority in writing of the Minister, i.e. the Minister of Transport, carry on, on these airports, a business similar to that conducted by appellant. This provision cannot be held to be restrictive of the alleged right claimed but not possessed by appellant. In its prohibitive form, the provision, if violated, gives rise to penal sanctions, thus insuring with greater effectiveness the management and control of these airports. With the unlimited discretion given by Parliament to the Governor-in-Council, the latter, had he deemed it necessary, might well have determined, by regulations, the circumstances in which the Minister should grant the authority. This, however, Parliament did not require the Governor-in-Council to do. In the exercise of the power given to him by s. 4A, the Minister performs an act which, of its nature, is clearly administrative.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorney for the appellant: Fran\u00e7ois Francoeur, Seven Islands.\nAttorney for the respondent: Louis Paradis, Baie Comeau.\n1 [1960] Que.

The summer camp had been advertised by a circular letter sent to the parents. The fatality occurred while the boy was participating in a \"water fight\" between the occupants of the two rowboats, which consisted of splashing water from one boat to another and which was supervised by two camp councillors. The boy, who was just learning to swim, jumped into the water in disregard of express orders which had been given to all the boys to remain in the boats. He stayed in the water near the boat although specifically told several times to get back into the boat by one of the councillors, who was himself swimming between the two boats. The boy swam some 15 feet away from the boats and was soon in difficulty. The two councillors, one of whom was very nearsighted, went to his rescue but could not save him.\nThe trial judge maintained the action. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, found the boy to have been 50% negligent. The dissenting judges would have affirmed the trial judge's decision. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court and the defendant school cross-appealed.\nHeld: (Locke J. dissenting): The appeal and the cross-appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ.: The relationship between the parents and the camp authorities was not contractual but was quasi-delictual; and since that relationship was not that of school masters and pupils within art. 1054 of the Civil Code, whereby there is a presumption of fault against the school master requiring him to prove that he could not have prevented the event which caused the harm, the liability of the camp authorities must be found in art. 1053 of the Civil Code and consequently must be proven. The warranty of security was neither an essential nor a necessary element of the contract.\nIn the present case there was common fault. The boy was negligent in disobeying orders. His actions were inexcusable for a boy of his age who, scarcely knowing how to swim, knew or should have known the danger of jumping in deep water. A child of tender years could be forgiven such stupidity and lack of judgment but not a mature adolescent. O'Brien v. A.G. of Quebec, [1961] S.C.R. 184, referred to.\nAs to the camp authorities, they were equally at fault. The councillors' failure to maintain the proper vigilance which was required by the playing of this dangerous game, was a contributory factor to this unfortunate accident.\nPer Locke J., dissenting: The water fight was not a dangerous game and the boys were perfectly safe so long as they followed orders and remained in the boats, whether they could swim or not. The fatality which occurred resulted not from the game itself but from the deliberate act of the boy in disobeying the councillors. The boy was not a child of 7 or 8 years of age who might be expected to be heedless and perhaps disregard instructions, but on the contrary he was old enough to understand the risk he assumed in disregarding the requests of the councillors. In so far as the action was based in contract and alleged that the defendant school had agreed to ensure the safety of the boy, it must fail since no such obligation was assumed. In so far as the matter was based on art. 1053 of the Civil Code, the position was similar to the common law doctrine as stated in Cook v. Midland Great Western Railway, [1909] A.C. 234. In the circumstances of this case there was no liability upon the defendant school, since the direct and proximate cause of the accident was the deliberate act of the boy in disobeying.\nIt would be exceedingly unfortunate if those public-spirited and charitable people who organize these summer camps for the purpose of giving an outing to poor children or to children who pay merely a nominal amount, were to be held responsible for such mishaps to boys of 14 or 15 years of age who act in defiance of their instructions.

MM. les Juges Hyde et Owen auraient rejet\u00e9 l'appel et confirm\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nCette excursion au Lac Lajoie avait \u00e9videmment \u00e9t\u00e9 organis\u00e9e avec l'assentiment des autorit\u00e9s du camp, et elle \u00e9tait sous la surveillance de trois moniteurs: Jacques Gougeon, \u00e2g\u00e9 de 17 ans, qui \u00e9tait en charge de l'exp\u00e9dition; Michel C\u00f4t\u00e9, \u00e2g\u00e9 de 19 ans, remplissait les fonctions d'assistant, et un troisi\u00e8me du nom de Pierre Belleau exer\u00e7ait \u00e9galement la surveillance sur ces adolescents dont les \u00e2ges variaient de 14 \u00e0 15 ans.\nLe groupe, compos\u00e9 d'environ une douzaine d'\u00e9coliers, partit du Lac Provost dans trois chaloupes pour se rendre au Lac Lajoie qui est reli\u00e9 par une rivi\u00e8re, et situ\u00e9 \u00e0 quelques milles de distance. Lorsque les excursionnistes furent rendus au Lac Lajoie, ils rev\u00eatirent leurs costumes de bain, et il fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9, pour l'amusement des \u00e9l\u00e8ves, que deux chaloupes se rendraient au large, \u00e0 environ 100 ou 150 pieds de la rive o\u00f9 il y aurait une petite bataille navale en miniature. Ce jeu consistait \u00e0 se lancer de l'eau d'une chaloupe \u00e0 J l'autre \u00e0 l'aide des rames. Dans l'une de ces chaloupes, avec quelques \u00e9l\u00e8ves, se trouvait le moniteur en charge Jacques Gougeon, et dans l'autre, son assistant Pierre Belleau. Le troisi\u00e8me groupe resta sur la plage, sous la surveillance de l'assistant Michel C\u00f4t\u00e9.\nUne d\u00e9fense formelle fut faite aux occupants des chaloupes de plonger \u00e0 l'eau au cours de cet exercice, mais il est arriv\u00e9 qu'en d\u00e9sob\u00e9issance de cet ordre, Joseph Grieco se jeta en dehors de la chaloupe o\u00f9 il se trouvait. Il se tint suspendu durant quelques instants \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re de l'embarcation, donna quelques coups de brasse, et revint de nouveau \u00e0 quelques reprises s'accrocher \u00e0 la chaloupe. Durant ce temps, Belleau, le surveillant de cette embarcation, avait lui-m\u00eame plong\u00e9 dans le lac. Bon nageur, il prenait plaisir \u00e0 aller pr\u00e8s de l'embarcation des adversaires, o\u00f9 il les arrosait avec l'aide d'une canette m\u00e9tallique qu'il remplissait d'eau.\nII aper\u00e7ut Grieco qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'eau, lui ordonna \u00e0 plusieurs reprises de retourner dans la chaloupe, mais apparemment, il n'insista pas davantage. L'endroit o\u00f9 se trouvait le jeune Grieco, \u00e0 cause de la disposition des embarcations, ne pouvait \u00eatre vu de Gougeon. Grieco d\u00e9cida cependant de nager plus loin, de s'\u00e9loigner de la chaloupe, mais \u00e9videmment, ses forces l'abandonn\u00e8rent, et il se noya malgr\u00e9 les efforts de Gougeon et de Belleau pour le sauver.\nLes appelants basent leur r\u00e9clamation sur les plans contractuel et quasi-d\u00e9lictuel. Il est vrai qu'\u00e0 l'invitation de l'intim\u00e9e, ils ont consenti \u00e0 ce que leur fils, moyennant $30, s\u00e9journ\u00e2t trois semaines \u00e0 cette colonie de vacances. Mais, je suis clairement d'accord avec la Cour du banc de la reine, qui a vu entre les appelants et l'intim\u00e9e non pas une relation contractuelle mais bien quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle. La responsabilit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e doit reposer sur une faute prouv\u00e9e ou pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e, suivant les dispositions des arts. 1053 et 1054 du Code Civil de la province. Mais je crois qu'il faut n\u00e9cessairement \u00e9liminer la faute pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e, car les directeurs des colonies de vacances ne sont pas des instituteurs au sens de l'art. 1054, sur qui p\u00e8se la pr\u00e9somption de la loi. C'est 1053 C.C. qui doit r\u00e9gir les relations des parties en cause.\nL'article 1054 C.C, para. 5, dit que l'instituteur est responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 par ses \u00e9l\u00e8ves, et cette disposition de la loi cr\u00e9e une pr\u00e9somption, et pour s'en lib\u00e9rer, le d\u00e9fendeur doit prouver qu'il n'a pu emp\u00eacher le fait qui a caus\u00e9 le dommage. En France, malgr\u00e9 que l'art. 1384 C.N. soit quelque peu diff\u00e9rent de notre art. 1054 C.C, il a tout de m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l'opinion dominante en doctrine est \u00e0 l'effet que l'art. 1384, 6e alin\u00e9a, qui pr\u00e9voit \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 des instituteurs, ne soit pas applicable aux colonies de vacances, patronages, ou autres institutions charitables, car ils n'ont pas pour mission de donner l'instruction aux enfants qu'ils re\u00e7oivent. La Cour de Cassation, dans un arr\u00eat rendu le 15 d\u00e9cembre 1936 (Gazette du Palais 1937,1.255), a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il est donc n\u00e9cessaire d'\u00e9tablir \u00e0 la charge soit du directeur de l'\u0153uvre, soit de ses pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s, une faute dans le sens de l'art. 1382 C.N. (notre art. 1053 C.C), et cette faute doit avoir une relation directe de cause \u00e0 effet avec l'accident. Vide \u00e9galement un arr\u00eat de la Cour de Paris du 26 novembre 1932 (Gaz. Pal. 1933, 1.335) et Savatier \u00abTrait\u00e9 de Responsabilit\u00e9 Civile\u00bb, vol. 1, 2e \u00e9d., n\u00b0 136.\nPour donner suite \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision de la Cour de Cassation, supra, l'art. 1384 du Code fran\u00e7ais a \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9 le 5 avril 1937, et on y a ajout\u00e9 le paragraphe suivant:\nEn ce qui concerne les instituteurs, les fautes, imprudences ou n\u00e9gligences invoqu\u00e9es contre eux comme ayant caus\u00e9 le fait dommageable, devront \u00eatre prouv\u00e9es, conform\u00e9ment au droit commun, par le demandeur \u00e0 l'instance.\nIl s'ensuit qu'en ce qui concerne les instituteurs, la loi fran\u00e7aise n'est pas semblable \u00e0 la n\u00f4tre actuellement. Mais quand l'arr\u00eat a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu, il y avait similarit\u00e9. Il ressort donc de la doctrine fran\u00e7aise et de la d\u00e9cision de la plus haute Cour de la R\u00e9publique, que la responsabilit\u00e9 des colonies de vacances ne doit pas reposer sur le plan contractuel, qu'aucune pr\u00e9somption n'existe contre leurs directeurs, mais qu'il faut prouver la faute qu'ils auraient pu commettre, suivant l'art. 1382 C.N. ou 1053 C.C Je m'accorde avec cet enseignement et cette jurisprudence, et je suis d'opinion que dans le cas qui nous occupe, la faute de l'intim\u00e9e n'est pas pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e mais qu'elle doit \u00eatre prouv\u00e9e.\nPour souligner davantage la diff\u00e9rence qui existe entre les instituteurs et les directeurs de colonies de vacances, on peut s'inspirer de l'art. 245 C.C. qui donne, parce qu'il est d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 par le p\u00e8re ou la m\u00e8re, un droit de correction \u00e0 ceux \u00e0 qui l'\u00e9ducation d'un enfant est confi\u00e9e. On ne pourrait s\u00e9rieusement pr\u00e9tendre que les directeurs de colonies de vacances peuvent exercer ce m\u00eame droit de correction.\nIl est certain qu'\u00e0 l'origine, il y a eu entente entre les parties, une convention en vertu de laquelle les demandeurs ont confi\u00e9 pour trois semaines leur fils \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e. Ceci ne signifie pas que cette entente comporte une obligation de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la part de l'Externat Classique, et le contrat intervenu ne fait pas na\u00eetre chez l'intim\u00e9e une obligation de rendre l'enfant dans l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 il l'a re\u00e7u, et ne cr\u00e9e pas \u00e0 sa charge une pr\u00e9somption de responsabilit\u00e9 en cas d'accident. L'obligation de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 n'est pas un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel ni n\u00e9cessaire au contrat, et c'est au droit commun de l'art. 1053 relatif \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle qu'il faut s'en tenir. C'est ce qu'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la Cour d'Appel de Lyon le 18 juillet 1928. Vide \u00e9galement Douai, 27 novembre 1933; Trib. de N\u00eemes, 25 janvier 1939; Trib. de Lyon, 21 d\u00e9cembre 1929.\nL'intim\u00e9e a bien contract\u00e9 l'obligation de nourrir, de loger le jeune Grieco, mais rien ne r\u00e9pugne \u00e0 l'esprit l\u00e9gal, qu'au cours de l'ex\u00e9cution d'une obligation contractuelle, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'entente pr\u00e9alable, naisse une obligation quasi-d\u00e9lictuelle. C'est, je crois, ce qui est arriv\u00e9 dans le cas qui nous occupe.\nCette action repose \u00e9videmment sur l'art. 1056 C.C. qui veut que dans tous les cas o\u00f9 la partie, contre qui le d\u00e9lit ou le quasi-d\u00e9lit a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis, d\u00e9c\u00e8de en cons\u00e9quence, sans avoir obtenu indemnit\u00e9 ou satisfaction, son conjoint, ses ascendants et ses descendants ont, pendant l'ann\u00e9e seulement \u00e0 compter du d\u00e9c\u00e8s, le droit de poursuivre celui qui en est l'auteur ou ses repr\u00e9sentants, pour les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9sultant de tel d\u00e9c\u00e8s. Ici, ce sont les parents qui ont institu\u00e9 l'action pour r\u00e9clamer des dommages qui leur r\u00e9sultent du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de leur enfant. Il ne fait pas de doute que, s'il y a faute commune, il faut tenir compte de la faute de la victime dans l'octroi des dommages aux personnes l\u00e9s\u00e9es par sa mort. Les ascendants ne peuvent recevoir plus que la personne d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e aurait pu recevoir elle-m\u00eame, si elle eut exerc\u00e9 son recours en son vivant. La faute de la victime n'est pas \u00e9trang\u00e8re au montant des dommages qui peuvent \u00eatre accord\u00e9s. Rainville Automobile v. Primario3.\nJe crois qu'il y a eu faute commune dans le cas qui nous est soumis. Le jeune Grieco a commis un geste imprudent. T Nouvel arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 ce camp, et sachant \u00e0 peine nager, malgr\u00e9 la d\u00e9fense r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e de ne pas plonger \u00e0 l'eau, il s'est jet\u00e9 dans le lac, et a refus\u00e9 d'\u00e9couter et d'ob\u00e9ir aux ordres qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s de retourner au canot. Son acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 spontan\u00e9, et je dirai m\u00eame qu'il est inexcusable de sa part. Ag\u00e9 de 14 ans et 11 mois, ce jeune savait ou devait savoir le danger qu'il y avait de se lancer ainsi dans l'eau profonde. On pardonnerait cette \u00e9tourderie, ce manque de r\u00e9flexion et de jugement, \u00e0 un enfant en bas \u00e2ge, mais non pas \u00e0 un adolescent m\u00fbri, qui peut parfaitement r\u00e9aliser le danger de poser un acte tel qu'il l'a fait. O'Brien v. Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec4.\nQuant \u00e0 l'Externat, je crois qu'il doit aussi supporter sa part de n\u00e9gligence et de responsabilit\u00e9. Ses moniteurs, \u00e9videmment, n'ont pas fait preuve de la vigilance n\u00e9cessaire dans l'occasion. Belleau, au lieu de rester dans la chaloupe avec ceux dont il avait le garde, s'en est \u00e9loign\u00e9 \u00e0 la nage, et n'a pas vu \u00e0 ce que les instructions qu'il a donn\u00e9es \u00e0 Grieco de retourner \u00e0 la chaloupe fussent suivies. Gougeon, myope, voyant \u00e0 peine \u00e0 dix pieds de distance, lorsqu'il a entendu les cris, a entrepris d'aider Belleau qu'il ne reconnaissait pas, au lieu de se diriger pour porter secours \u00e0 Grieco qui calait dans le lac. Le jeu que l'on pratiquait \u00e9tait assez dangereux, et aussi fallait-il exercer la plus grande surveillance possible. Je crois que ceci n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait et que ce manque de soin a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 ce malheureux accident.\nJe crois donc que la Cour du banc de la reine a bien jug\u00e9 lorsqu'elle a statu\u00e9 qu'il y a eu faute contributive dans une proportion de 50%.\nL'appelant demande de r\u00e9tablir le jugement du juge au proc\u00e8s qui a attribu\u00e9 la totalit\u00e9 de la faute \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e. Mais, cette derni\u00e8re a produit un contre-appel pr\u00e9tendant qu'elle doit \u00eatre compl\u00e8tement exon\u00e9r\u00e9e, et dans l'alternative que le montant des dommages soit r\u00e9duit. Je ne crois pas qu'il y ait lieu d'intervenir pour changer l'\u00e9valuation de ces dommages faite par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du banc de la reine. Comme j'en viens \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il y a eu faute commune, l'appel de m\u00eame que le contre-appel doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s.\nCependant, comme le succ\u00e8s est divis\u00e9, je crois qu'il ne devrait pas y avoir d'ordonnance quant aux frais devant cette Cour, ni sur l'appel principal ni sur le contre-appel.\nLocke J. (dissenting):\u2014Unless the liability which has been imposed upon the respondent in the present matter is either dependent upon or affected by the terms of the arrangement made between the boy's father and the respondent, the issue to be decided is one that is of importance throughout Canada. There are vacation camps similar to that operated by the respondent in the year 1955 provided during the summer months in all parts of Canada by various religious, charitable and other public-spirited organizations, for the purpose of giving children who live in cities a holiday in the woods, near lakes or rivers. In some of these a nominal amount is paid towards the upkeep of the camp, as was done in the present case by the appellant Dominique Grieco\u2014in others the expenses are met by public subscription where the parents are unable to pay anything towards giving their children such an outing. In such camps there are invariably older boys and young men interested in such charitable work who serve as camp leaders or assistants, generally gratuitously, and who supervise the camp activities, teach the children to swim and to look after themselves in the woods. If the liability of such organizations in respect of activities of this nature is as it has been found to be in the courts of Quebec, it is in the public interest that this Court should declare and define it. If the liability is imposed by arts. 1053 and 1054 of the Civil Code, the liability at common law is, in my opinion, the same.\nThe declaration alleges that the boy Joseph Grieco, the son of the appellants, was a scholar in the college carried on by the respondent, aged 14 years and 11 months; that the pupils were invited to go to a vacation camp to be operated by the respondent at Lake Provost for which they would be required to pay $10. per week and that the boy went to the camp for three weeks, paying this amount. It was further said that the parents were advised that there would be three priests at the camp to exercise surveillance over the children. Various allegations of negligence and \"imprudence\" were made on the part of the respondent and its officials, these including, inter alia, the fact that there were not three priests to supervise the children, that those supervising the children were inexperienced monitors and that they were not qualified in life saving and that the defendant should have seen that the children were accompanied by an adult.\nParagraph 8(o) of the declaration reads:\nLa d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e9tait garante de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des enfants confi\u00e9s \u00e0 ses soins et \u00e0 sa surveillance et elle a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 cette obligation de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pour les raisons plus haut mentionn\u00e9es.\nThe invitation referred to was given in a circular dated March 31, 1955, and referred to a previous letter which was not put in evidence but which was said to have given information of the establishment of a camp for the pupils of the college. The circular stated that the camp would provide an adventure for the students, that the boys who attended would be part of a well organized party \"where there is team work, leaders, responsibilities\" and that this was the great characteristic of the camp, and that the boys would take part in it and have responsibilities. The activities of the camp were described as religious, sports, including swimming and excursions, lectures and other social activities. It was said further that the camp grounds offered all kinds of possibilities for play and that the beach located nearby did not present any danger for swimmers (ce qui n'emp\u00eache pas la surveillance des moniteurs). The weekly payment of $10. covered food, lodging in tents and all of the facilities of the camp.\nAs described in the evidence the camp appears to have been well organized. Father Fagnan, a teacher in the college, was the director of the camp: in his temporary absence at the time of the accident Father Leonard was in charge. The \"chef du camp\" or camp leader was Claude Lalonde who had had a lengthy experience in that capacity in various similar camps in Quebec and who directed the camp activities. He was assisted by his brother Jacques Lalonde, a theological student aged 20 years who, similarly, had had several years' experience in such work. They were assisted by various older boys referred to as monitors, these including Jacques Gougeon then 17 years of age, described as a student, Michel C\u00f4t\u00e9 aged 19 years, a telephone technician, and by some younger boys including the witness Belleau. There is no indication that a third priest was present in the camp but nothing turns upon this.\nOne of the activities carried on under the direction of the two Lalondes was giving lessons in swimming and Jacques Lalonde was teaching the beginners, these including the boy Joseph Grieco. The evidence does not disclose whether the boy had any previous lessons in swimming but, as the evidence later disclosed, he was able to swim at least a short distance.\nJoseph Grieco had finished his first year in classics at the college and, according to his father, was a studious boy who passed his evenings in study and who intended to qualify eventually as a doctor. The course which the boy was taking at the college included French grammar, authors and composition, Latin grammar and vocabulary, English grammar and vocabulary, ancient history, geography, mathematics, botany and zoology. The reports of the examinations upon which he had written from the Faculty of Arts of the University of Montreal for the term preceding his death were excellent, and those from the college itself were equally good. There is nothing in the evidence except his unfortunate actions at the time he lost his life which indicates that he was other than a sensible and dependable boy who might be counted upon to exercise due care for his own safety.\nThe excursion was discussed on the evening preceding the accident by Father Fagnan, the two Lalondes and the monitors. The plan was to go in three row boats to an adjoining lake some two miles distant. On arriving there some of the boys decided to remain on the shore with C\u00f4t\u00e9, the others embarked in two of the boats which were of sturdy construction and proceeded a distance variously estimated as from 50 to 100 ft. from shore. There the boys engaged in what may be described as a water fight, throwing or splashing water on each other with the oars and with metal containers of some sort.\nIt was found by the learned trial judge, and his finding accepted on appeal, that before leaving the shore the boys were warned by Gougeon that they were not to get out of the boats. The water at the place where the game was carried on was some 12 or 15 ft. deep. The game itself was described by the learned trial judge as very dangerous, an opinion which, with respect, I do not share. So long as the boys remained in the boats they were perfectly safe and the fatality which occurred did not result from the game itself but from the deliberate act of Joseph Grieco in disobeying the requests of the monitor and those of the witness Belleau, getting out of the boat and swimming in the immediate vicinity.\nThere were some 12 boys who engaged in this game, 6 in each of the two boats. Gougeon was in one boat and took part in the game. Joseph Grieco was in the other boat where a boy of 15, Jacques Belleau, who described himself as \"second de patrouille\", was present. Both Gougeon and Belleau were good swimmers. According to Belleau, the two boats were some 50 ft. from the bank and during the progress of the game he plunged in to the water and when he was seen to do this by Gougeon the latter ordered him back in to the boat. At or about this time Belleau saw young Grieco in the water at the back of their boat, in a position where the latter would not be visible to Gougeon in the other boat. Grieco was then holding on to the boat and not swimming. Belleau asked Grieco to get back into the boat and the latter said that he would not get far behind the boat and would be careful. Belleau says that he warned him several times without effect. Shortly thereafter Grieco, who apparently was able to swim a short distance, was seen some 12 or 15 ft. from the boat, obviously in difficulty. Belleau who had returned to the boat plunged in and Gougeon plunged from the other boat and went to the boy's rescue. In spite of Gougeon's best efforts he was unable to save Grieco. The latter, as is unfortunately so often the case, became panic stricken and seized Gougeon around the neck, impeding his efforts, and three times the two sank below the surface. The boys remaining in the boats were apparently unable to render any assistance and C\u00f4t\u00e9, who was on the shore, did not assist saying that he was not a good enough swimmer to help in such rescue work.\nMuch emphasis was laid at the trial upon the fact that Gougeon was short sighted and had taken off his glasses while the water fight was in progress. Without his glasses he said that he could see the boy in the water from his boat and that he was in distress but that he could not identify him. This circumstance did not, however, contribute to the accident since young Grieco had entered the water at the stern of the row boat where he was obscured from view and, presumably, the time taken for his swimming from the rear of the boat to the point where he was in difficulty would be a matter of moments.\nGougeon was described by Father Fagnan as a well qualified swimmer and both Claude and Jacques Lalonde were of the same opinion, the latter saying that Gougeon was a better swimmer than he was. He had taken what were described as some Red Cross lessons in life saving but it was not contended that he had any particular qualifications in this respect, other than that of being a good swimmer. Gougeon had not only told the boys before they left the bank that they were not to go into the water but repeated this when they were at the scene where the game was carried on and Joseph Grieco's action in getting out of the boat was a deliberate refusal to follow what can only be described as a request.\nWith great respect for the contrary opinion of the learned trial judge and of the Court of Appeal5, I consider that there is no liability upon the respondent in these circumstances. The cardinal error, in my opinion, has been in considering the case as if the unfortunate boy had been a child of 7 or 8 years of age who might well be expected to be heedless and perhaps to disregard the instructions given to him by the monitor. Entirely different considerations apply where, as in the present case, the boy was nearly 15 years of age who might properly be expected to understand the risk he assumed in disregarding the requests made by Gougeon and Belleau.\nThe boys invited to this camp were apparently carefully selected by the college authorities. Speaking of this, Father Fagnan said that:\nLe camp s'adressait aux \u00e9tudiants de notre coll\u00e8ge d'un certain \u00e2ge, surtout les \u00e9l\u00e8ves d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments latins, syntaxe surtout ou de classes plus avanc\u00e9es, mais pas tellement vieux d'\u00e2ge.\nHe considered that they had made a judicious selection of the boys after consulting the principals, the school masters and certain professors, to find out if the boys were of a good disposition and would adapt themselves to camp life. Claude Lalonde had been chosen by the authorities of the college and was considered to be well qualified for the position of camp leader. Gougeon had had experience at the college as the leader of a troup of scouts and was deemed suitable to act as a monitor.\nThe average age of the boys was 14 or 15 years and the patrol leaders were chosen from among these boys and they worked under the four monitors who averaged 17 or 18 years of age. Jacques Lalonde, speaking of his previous experience with boys of this age, said:\nQ. Quelle exp\u00e9rience ant\u00e9rieure aviez-vous?\nA. Tout d'abord plusieurs exp\u00e9riences dans les camps scouts depuis ma m\u00e9thode.\nQ. \u00c7a veut dire quel \u00e2ge?\nA. Quinze ans, quatorze ans. Alors, ensuite j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 un \u00e9t\u00e9 comme moniteur \u00e0 Louisbourg dans un orphelinat, un autre \u00e9t\u00e9, apr\u00e8s ma belle-lettres, moniteur \u00e0 l'orphelinat d'Huberdeau. Ensuite j'ai fait des camps scouts sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s, le camp Radisson, sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 pour les assistants chefs et j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi chef scout pendant deux ans avant d'aller au camp Esca.\nQ. Au cours de vos exp\u00e9riences dans diff\u00e9rents camps, avez-vous vu des enfants de quatorze \u00e0 quinze ans avec certaines responsabilit\u00e9s \u00e0 l'endroit de leurs compagnons?\nA. Oui, par exemple, dans une troupe scoute les C.P. ont cet \u00e2ge-l\u00e0 ordinairement. Les chefs de patrouilles, ils n'ont pas la responsabilit\u00e9 d'un moniteur, il y a tout le temps un assistant ou un chef qui est responsable.\nClaude Lalonde said that it was a practice in other such camps to place boys of this age in charge of younger children as assistant to the camp leader.\nIt is a matter of common knowledge that boys of this age all over Canada engage in hunting and fishing expeditions, unaccompanied, and that they constantly carry fire arms. It is only in the case of children under 14 years of age that s. 88 of the Criminal Code requires that they obtain a permit in the prescribed form. This would appear to indicate that boys of this age are regarded by the authorities as being responsible and safely to be entrusted with weapons. These activities are carried on on marshes, lakes and rivers all over the country by such boys in canoes, row boats and other such craft, and it is perhaps needless to say, without supervision. In the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Taschereau in the Court of Queen's Bench, dealing with this aspect of the matter, he said in part:\nLe premier Juge a-t-il cependant raison de dire que la d\u00e9fenderesse doit \u00eatre aussi tenue responsable parce que:\nConnaissant le peu d'exp\u00e9rience de cet enfant il \u00e9tait de toute imprudence de \u2026 et de lui avoir fourni l'occasion de se mettre \u00e0 l'eau \u00e0 un endroit trop profond pour sa capacit\u00e9. \u2026 La d\u00e9sob\u00e9issance et l'\u00e9tourderie d'un enfant sont choses qui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9visibles et qui, en fait, \u00e9taient pr\u00e9vues; et c'est justement pour cela qu'on leur assigne des surveillants.\nJ'aurais \u00e9t\u00e9 enclin \u00e0 admettre la proposition du premier Juge s'il se fut agi d'un enfant de 7 \u00e0 8 ans parce que l'exp\u00e9rience d\u00e9montre qu'\u00e0 ce bas \u00e2ge, un jeune gar\u00e7on n'a pas toujours la maturit\u00e9 suffisante pour conna\u00eetre le danger et l'\u00e9viter. Toutefois, tel n'est pas le cas d'un \u00e9l\u00e8ve de quinze ans, qui a l'avantage de faire un cours classique et qui est, par cons\u00e9quent, encore plus m\u00fbri que le sont normalement ceux de son \u00e2ge.\nJe crois donc que les autorit\u00e9s pouvaient et devaient faire confiance au jeune Grieco, qu'elles n'avaient aucune raison de croire que celui-ci se jetterait \u00e0 l'eau malgr\u00e9 la d\u00e9fense qui lui en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, et que la noyade qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cons\u00e9quence est le r\u00e9sultat d'un acte qui n'\u00e9tait ni probable ni pr\u00e9visible.\nHaving said this, however, the learned judge concurred in the opinion of the majority of the Court that there was some fault on the part of the respondent, a conclusion with which I must respectfully disagree.\nIn so far as the action is based in contract and alleges that the respondent agreed to ensure the safety of the boy, it must fail since no such obligation was assumed by the respondent in the offer hereinbefore mentioned which, when accepted by the boy's father, presumably became the alleged contract.\nIn so far as the matter is based on arts. 1053 and 1054 of the Civil Code, in order to disclose a cause of action for quasi delict or negligence it is necessary that it be shown that there was a duty owing to the boy and a breach of that duty resulting in damage. As pointed out by Barclay J.A. in Bisson v. Les Commissaires d'\u00c9cole de St-Georges6, referring to an earlier decision by L\u00e9tourneau J. in L'Oeuvre des Terrains de Jeux de Qu\u00e9bec v. Cannon7, the position under art. 1053 is similar to the common law doctrine as stated by Lord Macnaghten in Cook v. Midland Great Western Railway8. It is quite impossible, in my opinion, in the absence of a contract to that effect to sustain a contention that the respondent was an insurer of the safety of this boy. Unless, therefore, the respondent was under an obligation to provide monitors skilled in life saving and capable of rescuing boys who, in defiance of the request and warnings of those in charge, persisted in attempting to swim in deep water, there can, in my opinion, be no liability in the present case.\nThe game of splashing water from one boat to another was not in itself dangerous. The boys were perfectly safe if they followed instructions and remained in the boats, whether or not they could swim. It was not the nature of the game that caused the unfortunate accident since there is nothing in the record to show that Joseph Grieco either fell or was pushed from the boat. All the evidence indicates that his action in climbing over the stern of the boat and getting into the water was deliberate and done in such a way that Gougeon, the monitor in the other boat, would not see him. These boys were not, as small children are in relation to a school master, subject to the orders of the monitor but Gougeon had requested that they should not leave the boats, and Belleau when he saw Grieco at the stern of the boat asked him to get into it and warned him of the danger. In spite of this he persisted in the course which unhappily resulted in the loss of his life.\nThus the direct and proximate cause of the accident was the deliberate act of the boy and, accordingly, in my opinion there is no basis for the action.\nWe have not been referred to any decided cases in the courts of Quebec or elsewhere where liability has been found in circumstances such as exist in the present matter. Claims for damage due to lack of supervision of children by those having them over their control are more often found in actions against school authorities such as in Camkin v. Bishop9, and in the recent case of Schade v. Winnipeg School District10. In the first of these cases the action was brought against a school and the head master alleging a breach of the duty of supervision imposed at common law where a boy 14\u00bd years of age was injured by the negligent act of a playmate. The Court of Appeal was unanimous in finding that there was no liability. In Schade's case the duty of supervision was imposed by the Public Schools Act of Manitoba and the boy, 13 years of age, was injured in the course of a game of baseball upon the school property by coming in contact with a stake which was driven in the ground in the outfield, where it was plainly visible. The report of this case contains a valuable collection of the authorities by Chief Justice Williams who found that there was no liability.\nApart from the present case, it would be exceedingly unfortunate, in my view, if those public-spirited and charitable people who organize these summer camps for the purpose of giving an outing to poor children or to children who pay merely a nominal amount towards the expense of the camp, should be under any such liability as has been found in the present case. To so hold would tend to prevent the carrying on of such camps since if those operating them are to be held responsible for such mishaps to boys 14 or 15 years of age who act in defiance of their instructions, it would, I think, discourage these charitable activities, to the great detriment of a large number of children throughout Canada.\nI would dismiss this appeal, allow the cross-appeal and direct that judgment be entered dismissing the action, with costs throughout if they are demanded.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed without costs, Locke J. dissenting.\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs, appellants: Nadeau, Villeneuve & Pigeon, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: Tansey, de Grandpr\u00e9, de Grandpr\u00e9, Bergeron & Monet, Montreal.\n1 [1961] Que.

The initial payment was $20,000, and the defendants agreed to execute and deliver to the plaintiffs a first mortgage on the lands and premises to secure payment of the balance owing and a chattel mortgage on the other property transferred as collateral thereto. Later, by a bill of sale, the plaintiffs transferred to the defendants the goods and chattels for an expressed consideration of $20,000. Subsequently the defendants executed a mortgage on the lands for $70,000, and a collateral mortgage on the goods and chattels. The mortgage on the lands contained a. personal covenant for payment. The defendants fell into arreara in respect of the stipulated monthly payments, and in foreclosure proceedings brought by the plaintiffs in respect of the lands and the personal property the trial judge held in favour of the plaintiffs. On appeal from this judgment, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court refused foreclosure of the goods and chattels, holding that the chattel mortgage was invalid. The plaintiffs appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nIt was not intended under the agreement between the parties that the initial payment should be applied solely in respect of the purchase of the chattels, leaving the balance relating entirely to the land, and the intent of the agreement was not affected by the fact that the bill of sale showed as its consideration the amount of the down payment under the agreement.\nThe plaintiffs were possessed of two securities for the defendants' indebtedness, and the question was as to whether s. 34(17) of The Judicature Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 164, precluded the enforcement of the security on the chattels. This section of the Act limits the right of a mortgagee of land who brings action upon the mortgage to the right to the land conferred by that mortgage. The effect of para, (a) is that in an action on a mortgage of land no action lies on a covenant for payment \"in any such mortgage\". This takes away the right to bring action on the covenant for payment in a land mortgage. There was nothing in this provision which forbids a debtor to give security for a debt on property in addition to a mortgage on land or which forbids the creditor to enforce such security.\nHere the taking of the chattel mortgage was not an indirect method of attempting to enforce the personal covenant contained in the land mortgage, nor was this action, in so far as it sought foreclosure of the chattel mortgage, an action based on a mortgage of land, whose purpose was to recover the debt referred to in the land mortgage. The essence of the transaction was that it consisted of a sale of a totality of assets, consisting partly of land and partly of chattels, under the terms of which the vendor was to be entitled to security on all assets sold. The chattel mortgage was a security upon a specific part of those assets and its enforcement was not merely an indirect attempt to enforce the covenant for payment contained in the land mortgage.\nMacdonald v. Clarkson, [19231 3 W.W.R. 690; Holland-Canada Mortgage Co. Ltd. v. Hutchings, [1934] 2 W.W.R. 137; British American Oil Co. Ltd. v. Ferguson (1951), 1 W.W.R. (N.S.) 103; Crang v. Rutherford, [1936] 2 W.W.R. 205, distinguished; Martin v. Strange and Stocks Co-op. Credit Society, [1943] 2 W.W.R. 123, referred to.\nThe additional contention that the Supreme Court of Alberta did not have jurisdiction to foreclose the chattels secured by the chattel mortgage because of the provisions of The Seizures Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 307, and of The Conditional Sales Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 54, was rejected. The Seizures Act restricted the plaintiffs' rights regarding the taking of possession of the chattels mortgaged under power of distress. It did not, however, expressly or by implication, purport to prevent proceedings for the foreclosure of a chattel mortgage. Section 19 of The Conditional Sales Act did nothing more than limit the remedy of the plaintiffs, in respect of the chattel mortgage, to the chattels mortgaged. The plaintiffs were not, in these proceedings, seeking anything more than foreclosure of the land and of the chattels. They did not ask for a judgment over in respect of any deficiency and the judgment given by the trial judge did not purport to give them anything more.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta1, allowing an appeal from a judgment of Primrose J. Appeal allowed.\nW. G. Morrow, Q.C., for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nJ. W. K. Shortreed, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014By an agreement, in writing, dated June 30, 1959, the appellants agreed to sell to the respondents, who agreed to purchase from the appellants, an hotel, situated at Cold Lake, Alberta, with the furniture, furnishings, fixtures and equipment therein, for a total price of $90,000. The initial payment was $20,000, paid partly in cash and partly by the transfer to the appellants of some lands in Edmonton, subject to mortgage. The remaining balance of $70,000 was to be paid, with interest at the rate of 7 per cent per annum, by monthly payments of $1,000, commencing on September 1, 1959.\nIt was agreed that on September 1, 1959, the appellants would transfer clear title to the respondents of the lands on which the hotel was situated and would give a bill of sale of the goods and chattels clear of all liens, charges and encumbrances. The respondents agreed to execute and deliver to the appellants a first mortgage on the lands and premises to secure payment of the balance owing and a chattel mortgage on the other property transferred as collateral thereto. It is clear that these mortgages were to be delivered to secure payment for both the land and the chattels.\nPursuant to the agreement, a transfer of the lands was registered, and on November 5, 1959, a mortgage from the respondents to the appellants, executed on August 31, 1959, was duly registered, securing the payment of the sum of $70,000.\nOn August 25, 1959, the appellants executed a bill of sale of the goods and chattels in favour of the respondents, who, on August 31, 1959, executed a chattel mortgage on the same goods and chattels, in favour of the appellants, to secure payment of the sum of $70,000. Both these documents were registered on November 4, 1959.\nThe bill of sale stated that the goods and chattels were transferred in consideration of the sum of $20,000 paid by the respondents to the appellants. There is no evidence as to how this figure was determined, but it is the amount of the initial payment made under the agreement of June 30, 1959. There is no evidence as to the consideration disclosed in the transfer of the land, which was not filed as an exhibit at the trial.\nThe chattel mortgage recited the indebtedness of the respondents to the appellants in the amount of $70,000 under the agreement for the sale of the hotel, and recited that it was a term of that agreement that that sum should be secured by a mortgage on the land and a collateral mortgage on the personal property, included in the sale. It was stated in the chattel mortgage that it was collateral to the mortgage on the land. The respondents fell into arrears in respect of the stipulated monthly payments and the appellants commenced foreclosure proceedings in respect of the lands and the chattels. A judgment was obtained declaring that, as at its date, June 19, 1961, there was due and owing by the respondents the sum of $67,954.82 to be realized by sale of the mortgaged lands, goods and chattels, in default of which foreclosure might be ordered. A six months period of redemption was fixed, with a provision that this might be extended to twelve months if the respondents paid to the appellants $750 per month commencing July 1, 1961, with a right to apply for a further extension.\nOn appeal from this judgment, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta2 refused foreclosure of the goods and chattels, holding that the chattel mortgage was invalid.\nThe main issue in this appeal is as to whether the chattel mortgage was invalid by reason of the provisions of s. 34(17) of The Judicature Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 164, the relevant portions of which provide as follows:\n(17) In an action brought upon a mortgage of land whether legal or equitable, or upon an agreement for the sale of land, the right of the mortgagee or vendor thereunder is restricted to the land to which the mortgage or agreement relates and to foreclosure of the mortgage or cancellation of the agreement for sale, as the case may be, and no action lies\n(a) on a covenant for payment contained in any such mortgage or agreement for sale,\nThe Court below has stated its conclusions in the following terms:\nIt seems to me that the only logical conclusion in relation to the facts of the present case is that it is an action based upon a mortgage of land. While it is true that the original transaction was one in which both lands and chattels were agreed to be sold, nevertheless the chattels were paid for in full, according to the consideration expressed in the bill of sale dated the 25th day of August 1959. Having obtained clear title to the chattels, the appellants several days later gave a chattel mortgage to the respondents expressed to be collateral to the land mortgage. The position of a mortgagee under that chattel mortgage cannot be any higher than if the mortgagors had pledged goods other than those they had obtained under the bill of sale.\nThe land mortgage contains a personal covenant requiring the appellants to pay to the respondents the sum of $70,000 in lawful money of Canada, together with interest as stipulated in the mortgage. The chattel mortgage is, in my view, an indirect method of attempting to enforce the personal covenant contained in the land mortgage. That phase of the present action by which the mortgagees endeavour to foreclose under the chattel mortgage is in reality an action based upon the mortgagors' covenant to pay and as such is in direct contravention to Section 34 (17) of The Judicature Act, being Chap. 164, Revised Statutes of Alberta 1955. See the reasoning of Clarke, J.A., in Macdonald v. Clarkson [1923] 3 W.W.R. 690, and of Frank Ford, J., in Holland-Canada Mtge. Co. Ltd. v. Hutchings [1934] 2 W.W.R. 137, and also the judgment of Macdonald, J.A. in British American Oil Company Limited (1951) 1 W.W.R. (N.S.) 103. See also Crang v. Rutherford [1936] 2 W.W.R. 205.\nIt follows that the order nisi of foreclosure granted by the learned trial judge respecting the chattels must be set aside. It also follows that the respondents' aforesaid chattel mortgage is invalid.\nWith respect, I do not agree that subs. (17) of s. 34 of The Judicature Act renders the chattel mortgage invalid.\nThe reasoning in the Court below would appear to be based upon the view of the transaction between the appellants and the respondents expressed in the first paragraph of the portion of the reasons for judgment above quoted; namely, that the chattels had been paid for in full and that thereafter the appellants' position was no different from what it would have been if the respondents had pledged goods other than those which they had obtained under the bill of sale. I do not share this view of the arrangement. The transaction between the appellants and the respondents is set forth in their agreement of June 30, 1959. It was, essentially, for the sale of an hotel business as a going concern, including both land and chattels. It was not intended under this agreement that the initial payment should be applied solely in respect of the purchase of the chattels, leaving the balance relating entirely to the land, and I do not think that the intent of the agreement is affected by the fact that the bill of sale showed as its consideration the amount of the down payment under the agreement. Under that agreement title to the chattels was to be vested in the respondents, but the bill of sale which transferred that title must be considered as being only one stage in the total transaction, which contemplated payment for both the land and the chattels in instalments, with security being given to the appellants for payment in the form of mortgages upon both the land and the chattels.\nIt is true that both the agreement and the chattel mortgage refer to that mortgage as being collateral to the land mortgage, but, as used in those documents, this does not mean anything more than that the security on the chattels is in addition to that on the land. I do not construe it as meaning that this security was subordinate to that upon the land. (See Earl Jowitt's Dictionary of English Law, p. 403.)\nIn my opinion, the appellants were possessed of two securities for the respondents' indebtedness, and the question then is as to whether s. 34(17) of The Judicature Act precludes the enforcement of the security on the chattels.\nIt provides that in an action brought upon a mortgage of land the right of the mortgagee thereunder is restricted to the land to which the mortgage relates and to foreclosure of the mortgage. In its context, the word \"thereunder\" must refer to the mortgage, for it is by virtue of the mortgage, not the action, that the mortgagee has a \"right\". The section, therefore, limits the right of a mortgagee of land who brings action upon it to the right to the land conferred by that mortgage.\nThe effect of para, (a) is that in an action on a mortgage of land no action lies on a covenant for payment contained \"in any such mortgage\". This takes away the right to bring action on the covenant for payment in a land mortgage.\nI do not find anything in this provision which forbids a debtor to give security for a debt on property in addition to a mortgage on land or which forbids the creditor to enforce such security. It derogates from the common law rights of a mortgagee of land and, consequently, I see no reason to read into it any intention beyond what is to be determined by a strict consideration of the words actually used.\nThe cases mentioned in the portion of the judgment of the Appellate Division, previously quoted, do not deal with this issue.\nMacdonald v. Clarkson3 dealt with an earlier provision of The Judicature Act, R.S.A. 1922, c. 72, s. 37(o)(i), which stated that, unless otherwise ordered by the Court or a judge, a judgment in an action brought on a mortgage of land should provide for realization, in the first instance, pro tanto, by a sale of the mortgaged land. A mortgagee, who had transferred his mortgage to the plaintiff, with a covenant to pay the mortgage if the mortgagor made default, was sued on that covenant. The mortgagor was a defendant in the same action to a suit brought in respect of the mortgage. The case held that the action was an action on a mortgage, within the subsection, and that personal judgment could not be obtained on the covenant for payment until after sale of the land.\nThis decision was applied in Holland-Canada Mortgage Co. Ltd. v. Hutchings4, in an action brought on a bond by which the defendant became a surety for the repayment of a mortgage. It was held that he had the right to compel the plaintiff to add the mortgagors as parties to the action.\nBritish American Oil Co. Ltd. v. Ferguson5 related to the application of the provisions of the predecessor of the subsection involved in the present case, but related to an action on a bond given by the individuals who, as a partnership, had agreed to purchase lands, whereby they were obliged to pay the amount of the purchase price if the partnership failed so to do.\nCrang v. Rutherford6 dealt with the earlier provision of The Judicature Act, and involved a \"guarantee\" by the mortgagors to pay the mortgage debt, without the mortgagee having to resort to foreclosure. This covenant was given in consideration of an extension by the mortgagee of the time for payment of the mortgage debt. It was held that the action, so far as it was based on the so-called guarantee, was an action brought on a mortgage of land, within the section.\nEach of these cases was an action on a separate covenant for the payment of the amount payable either under a mortgage or an agreement for sale of land. In two of them the covenant was given by a surety. In the other two it was given by the debtors themselves. The reasoning in these cases may be summarized in the following extracts from two of them.\nIn the case of Macdonald v. Clarkson, at p. 692, Clarke J.A. said:\nI think there can be little doubt that the substance of the action is the recovery of the mortgage debt, it is immaterial how or by whom paid, if paid in any way the action is at an end. The personal liability of the mortgagor arises from his covenant to pay contained in the mortgage and that of the appellant from his covenant to pay contained in the transfer, but in either case it is the mortgage debt that is to be paid. The plaintiff could not succeed without establishing the mortgage and the amount owing upon it. The covenants are the means of fastening liability for the mortgage debt upon, the covenantors. Certainly an action against the mortgagor alone upon the covenant in a mortgage under The Land Titles Act would be an action brought upon a mortgage and if the covenants of the appellant were contained in the mortgage it would be an action upon the mortgage. What difference does it make that the covenant is contained in another instrument? It is still a covenant to pay the mortgage debt.\nIn British American Oil Co. Ltd. v. Ferguson, at p. 110, W. A. Macdonald J.A. said:\nIt seems to me that the whole transaction and the only transaction between the parties was one relating to the sale of land. This transaction, at plaintiff's insistence, was expressed in two documents, and the two together constitute the agreement covering the sale of the land. They should be read and considered together.\nIn vol. II, Corpus Juris (Secundum), under the title \"Bonds,\" para. 43, the following proposition, for which a number of authorities are cited, appears:\nIt may be stated generally that, where a bond and another contract or instrument relate to and form one and the same transaction or the bond refers to such other instrument or is conditioned for the performance of specific agreements set forth therein, such instrument with all its stipulations, limitations, or restrictions becomes a part of the bond, and the two should be read together and construed as a whole. In form, the liability of the defendants in this action arises under the\nobligation imposed by the terms of the bond, but in substance it is an action based on an agreement for the sale of land and its purpose is to recover the purchase-price of the land. When the two documents are read and construed as a unit, the action on the bond comes within the scope of The Judicature Act, ESA, 1942, ch. 129, sec. 36 (o), as completely as would an action based on the purchaser's covenant to pay.\nIn another decision of the Appellate Division, in the case of Martin v. Strange and Stocks Co-op. Credit Society7, the Court expressly reserved the question of the applicability of the predecessor of the present subsection in respect of security collateral to an agreement for sale of land.\nIn my opinion the taking of the chattel mortgage in the present case was not an indirect method of attempting to enforce the personal covenant contained in the land mortgage, nor was this action, in so far as it sought foreclosure of the chattel mortgage, an action based on a mortgage of land, whose purpose was to recover the debt referred to in the land mortgage. The essence of the present transaction is that it consisted of a sale of a totality of assets, consisting partly of land and partly of chattels, under the terms of which the vendor was to be entitled to security on all assets sold. The chattel mortgage was a security upon a specific part of those assets and its enforcement is not, in my view, merely an indirect attempt to enforce the covenant for payment contained in the land mortgage.\nThe respondents also contended that the Supreme Court of Alberta did not have jurisdiction to foreclose the chattels secured by the chattel mortgage because of the provisions of The Seizures Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 307, and of The Conditional Sales Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 54. In view of the decision of the Appellate Division on the first point, it did not have to deal with this issue.\nThe former statute, as its title indicates, is \"An Act respecting Executions, Seizures under Writs of Execution, and Seizures under Powers of Distress\". Clearly the present case does not relate to an execution or a seizure under a writ of execution.\n\"Power of distress\" is defined in s. 2(h) as follows:\n(h) \"power of distress\" means the right that a person has to enforce the payment of any claim against, or the taking of any goods or chattels out of the possession of, another person by the taking of a personal chattel out of the possession of such last mentioned person otherwise than by the authority of a writ of execution or other process of a similar nature;\n\"Distress\" is defined in s. 2(d):\n(d) \"distress\" means any and all acts or things done in the exercise of a power of distress;\nSection 22 provides:\n22. No distress shall be made and no levy shall be made under any distress unless the person entitled to cause the distress and levy to be made or his duly authorized agent has executed and delivered to some person authorized by this Act to make and levy a distress a proper warrant in that behalf.\nThe Act contains provisions as to the procedure to be followed where goods have been seized under a distress warrant.\nThe Act restricts the appellants' rights regarding the taking of possession of the chattels mortgaged under power of distress. It does not, however, expressly or by implication, purport to prevent proceedings for the foreclosure of a chattel mortgage.\nI agree with the statement made in Barron & O'Brien on \"Chattel Mortgages & Bills of Sale\", 3rd ed., p. 128, that \"It seldom happens in practice that a mortgagee of personal chattels seeks the assistance of the Court by foreclosure, yet such a course is open to him.\" In my opinion the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to entertain such proceedings and there is nothing in The Seizures Act which precludes it from so doing.\nThe provisions of The Conditional Sales Act on which the respondents rely are the following:\nProceedings for Purchase Price\n19. (1) When any goods or chattels are hereafter sold and after delivery the vendor has a lien on them for all or part of the purchase price, the vendor's right to recover the unpaid purchase money, if he seizes or causes the said goods or chattels or a portion thereof to be seized under a conditional sale agreement, is restricted to his lien on the goods or chattels and his right to repossession and sale thereof, in which case no action is maintainable for the purchase price or any part thereof notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other Act or in an agreement or contract between the vendor and purchaser.\n(2) Instead of seizing or causing to be seized the goods or chattels or any of them under the provisions of the conditional sale agreement, the vendor may elect to bring an action against the purchaser for the purchase price or part thereof of any of the goods or chattels so sold.\n(3) If the said goods or chattels or any of them are seized under an execution issued pursuant to a judgment obtained in the said action, then the vendor's right to recover under the said judgment in so far as it is based on the purchase price of the said goods or chattels is restricted to the amount realized from the sale of the said goods or chattels so seized and the said judgment, to the extent that it is based upon the purchase price of the said goods or chattels and the taxed costs, shall be deemed to be fully paid and satisfied.\n(4) This section applies to all instalment sales whether effected by way of a conditional sale agreement or lien note or by way of an agreement or arrangement made at the time of sale or subsequent thereto whereby the purchaser gives to the vendor a chattel mortgage or bill of sale covering the whole or part of the purchase price of the goods or chattels sold.\nIf, by virtue of subs. (4), the provisions of s. 19 are applicable in the present case to the agreement of June 30, 1959, I do not see how, in the present proceedings, that section does anything more than to limit the remedy of the appellants, in respect of the chattel mortgage, to the chattels mortgaged, just as s. 34(17) of The Judicature Act limits their rights, in respect of the land mortgage, to the land. The appellants are not, in these proceedings, seeking anything more than foreclosure of the land and of the chattels. They do not ask for a judgment over in respect of any deficiency and the judgment given by the learned trial judge does not purport to give them anything more. I would, therefore, allow this appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge. The appellants should be entitled to their costs in this Court and in the Court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiffs, appellants: Morrow, Hurlburt, Reynolds, Stevenson & Kane, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Shortreed, Shortreed & Stainton, Edmonton.\n1 (1961-62), 36 W.W.R. 547, 30 D.L.R.

Ferland, [1962] S.C.R. 545\nDate: 1962-04-24\nHenri-Paul Dufour and Ren\u00e9 Drolet (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nJean Ferland (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1961: November 16; 1962: April 24.\nPresent: Taschereau, Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nJury trial\u2014Motor vehicles\u2014Jury's verdict\u2014Written questions and answers\u2014Sufficiency\u2014Clarity\u2014Code of Civil Procedure, art. 483.\nThe plaintiff was driving his motorcycle when it collided with a vehicle owned by the defendant Dufour and driven by his employee Drolet. The jury came to the conclusion that the action should be dismissed and the trial judge so ordered. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial on the ground that the jury's answers to the questions put to it were not sufficiently clear so as to satisfy the requirements of art. 483 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The defendants appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed, and the jury's verdict as well as the judgment of the trial judge should be restored.\nThe jury's verdict must be sufficiently clear so that the trial judge can determine whether or not there was civil liability. Some of the jury's answers in this case could have been clearer, but the verdict taken as a whole allowed the Court to supply the minor deficiencies. Article 483 is not to be construed too narrowly, and the Court should consider the answers as a whole. Meticulous criticisms of a jury's findings were not admissible and they must always be read with and construed in the light of the issues presented by the pleadings, the evidence and the charge of the trial judge. In the present case the verdict clearly showed that the plaintiff had failed to make out a case, and that the plaintiff's motocycle struck the rear of the defendant's vehicle. This finding was sufficient to allow the trial judge to render judgment in accordance with the verdict of the jury. B.C. Electric Ry. v. Dunphy, 59 S.C.R. 263, and Sloan v. Fraid, [1943] Que. K.B. 91, referred to. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Lacroix J. and ordering a new trial. Appeal allowed.\nW. Desjardins, Q.C., and A. Desjardins, for the defendants, appellants.\nJ. de Billy, Q.C., and A. Marceau, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014Il s'agit dans la pr\u00e9sente cause d'un jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec2, qui a maintenu l'appel du demandeur en Cour sup\u00e9rieure et a ordonn\u00e9 un nouveau proc\u00e8s.\nLe demandeur-intim\u00e9 conduisait sa motocyclette dans les limites du Village de Beaupr\u00e9, et vint en collision avec une camionnette, propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Henri-Paul Dufour et conduite par son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 Ren\u00e9 Drolet. A l'issue du proc\u00e8s, le jury vint \u00e0 la conclusion que l'action devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e, et l'honorable Juge G\u00e9rard Lacroix a confirm\u00e9 le verdict rendu. La Cour du banc de la reine, M. le Juge Miquelon dissident, a cru que les r\u00e9ponses du jury aux questions pos\u00e9es n'\u00e9taient pas suffisamment pr\u00e9cises, et que les exigences de l'art. 483 C.P. qui veut que le verdict soit explicite et articul\u00e9, n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaites.\nLes questions pos\u00e9es au jury et pertinentes \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination de la pr\u00e9sente cause sont les suivantes:\n1.\u2014Le demandeur a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'un accident le ou vers le 10 juin 1959, alors qu'il conduisait sa motocyclette, sur la route Royale \u00e0 Beaupr\u00e9?\n2.\u2014Cet accident a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat d'une collision entre la moto-cyclette du demandeur et une camionnette de livraison appartenant \u00e0 Henri-Paul Dufour et conduite par Ren\u00e9 Drolet?\n3.\u2014Le conducteur de cette camionnette \u00e9tait-il l'employ\u00e9 et le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 du d\u00e9fendeur Henri-Paul Dufour, et dans l'exercice de ses fonctions?\n4.\u2014L'accident dont fut victime le demandeur est-il d\u00fb \u00e0 la seule faute ou la seule n\u00e9gligence ou imprudence de Ren\u00e9 Drolet, l'employ\u00e9 du d\u00e9fendeur? Si qui, en quoi consiste cette faute ou cette n\u00e9gligence?\n5.\u2014L'accident est-il. d\u00fb \u00e0 la seule faute ou la seule n\u00e9gligence du demandeur Jean Ferland lui-m\u00eame? Si oui, en quoi consiste cette faute ou cette n\u00e9gligence? 6.\u2014Cet accident est-il d\u00fb, pour une partie, \u00e0 la faute ou \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence de Ren\u00e9 Drolet, l'employ\u00e9 du d\u00e9fendeur Dufour, et en m\u00eame temps, pour une partie, \u00e0 la faute ou \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence du demandeur Jean Ferland? Si oui, dites:\na) quelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la faute ou la n\u00e9gligence de Ren\u00e9 Drolet?\nb) quelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la faute ou la n\u00e9gligence du demandeur Jean Ferland?\nLes r\u00e9ponses ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9es:\n1re question: Oui, 12.\n2e question: Oui, 12.\n3e question: Oui, 12.\n4e question: Non, 12.\n5e question: Oui 11 sur 12, on a suppos\u00e9 qu'il avait eu une distraction.\n6e question: Sans r\u00e9ponse.\na) sans r\u00e9ponse.\nb) sans r\u00e9ponse.\nPersonne ne conteste, et personne ne peut contester, que les r\u00e9ponses du jury, comme dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, lorsqu'il y a eu d\u00e9finition des faits, le verdict doit \u00eatre suffisamment pr\u00e9cis pour permettre au juge au proc\u00e8s de d\u00e9terminer si, en droit, il y a eu ou non responsabilit\u00e9 civile.\nIl s'agissait dans cette cause de d\u00e9terminer si c'est le camion de Dufour qui a frapp\u00e9 la motocyclette de Ferland, ou si c'est Ferland, comme l'expliquait le juge aux jur\u00e9s, qui, par inhabilit\u00e9 ou distraction, a frapp\u00e9 le camion sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 droit arri\u00e8re. C'est sur ce point que le d\u00e9bat a \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9.\nEn formulant les r\u00e9ponses qu'il a donn\u00e9es, le jury \u00e9videmment est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que c'est la motocyclette qui a frapp\u00e9 le camion. Certaines r\u00e9ponses pourraient \u00eatre s\u00fbrement plus pr\u00e9cises, mais l'ensemble du verdict permet de suppl\u00e9er \u00e0 ces insuffisances mineures. Les r\u00e9ponses n'attribuent aucune faute au conducteur du camion, et, \u00e0 la cinqui\u00e8me question, le jury exprimait l'opinion que l'accident \u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 la seule faute de Ferland qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 distrait. C'est la conclusion qu'il faut n\u00e9cessairement tirer de l'ensemble des r\u00e9ponses, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des instructions donn\u00e9es par M. le juge Lacroix qui a clairement d\u00e9fini les questions qui \u00e9taient en litige.\nLa loi ne veut pas et n'a pas cette rigidit\u00e9 qui exige une pr\u00e9cision rigoureuse \u00e0 chaque r\u00e9ponse, mais c'est l'ensemble de ces r\u00e9ponses qu'il faut consid\u00e9rer. Ainsi, dans son Manuel de la Cour d'Appel, commentant cet art. 483 du Code de P.C., M. le juge Rivard dit avec infiniment de raison:\nqu'il y a lieu d'intervenir seulement si la r\u00e9ponse omise importe pour la d\u00e9cision du proc\u00e8s, et que le reste du verdict ne permet pas d'y suppl\u00e9er.\nDans une cause de British Columbia Electric Railway Company v. Dunphy3, la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada a eu l'occasion de dire sous quel aspect il fallait expliquer cet art. 483 et l'honorable juge Anglin dit, dans des notes, \u00e0 la page 271, ce qui suit:\nMeticulous criticisms of a jury's findings are not admissible and they must always be read with and construed in the light of the issues presented by the pleadings, the evidence and the charge of the trial judge. While it might have been more satisfactory had the second finding been more specific, if dealt with in the manner I have indicated it seems to be sufficiently certain what the jury meant by it.\nEt l'honorable juge Mignault, \u00e0 la page 273:\nI think it sufficiently assigns the lack of sufficient precautions which in the jury's opinion caused the accident.\nDans Sloan v. Fraid4, la Cour d'Appel a refus\u00e9 d'intervenir et s'est exprim\u00e9e de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nIf a jury answering the usual questions as to fault finds that the accident was not due exclusively to the fault of the defendant, that there was no common fault and that it was due exclusively to the fault of the plaintiff, without stating in what such fault consisted, such answers (not unreasonable in the light of the evidence) are sufficient to entitle the defendant to a judgment according to the verdict.\nA mon sens, l'ensemble du verdict r\u00e9v\u00e8le clairement que le demandeur n'a pas prouv\u00e9 son action, mais qu'il a, au contraire, \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par le jury que c'est la motocyclette qui a frapp\u00e9 l'arri\u00e8re de la camionnette. Ceci \u00e9tait suffisant pour permettre au juge au proc\u00e8s de rendre un jugement suivant le verdict rendu.\nL'appel doit donc \u00eatre maintenu, le verdict de m\u00eame que le jugement du juge au proc\u00e8s r\u00e9tablis, et l'action rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les Cours.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorneys for the defendants, appellants: Desjardins & Desjardins, Quebec.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, respondent: Marquis, Marceau & Jessop, Quebec.\n1 [1961] Que.

There was no other traffic. The defendant had driven a black car on that road at that time but denied any knowledge of the accident. The trial judge came to the conclusion, upon the evidence, that it was the black car driven by the defendant which had struck the child. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.

The deceased, a bachelor of 87 years of age, after living in furnished lodgings for many years, went to reside with his sister, one of the defendants. He was suffering from diabetes, was hard of hearing and almost blind. Some two months later he was admitted to hospital for an operation. Before the operation, he expressed to his nephew, the other defendant, a sudden desire to make a new will. The nephew consulted a notary by telephone; the latter refused to attend but advised the nephew as to how a will in the English form should be drafted. No attempt was made to get in touch with the deceased's own notary. A document was written out from a draft prepared by the nephew. It was read out to the deceased, signed by him and witnessed by two witnesses. In this will the deceased left everything to his sister and named his nephew as sole executor. The will was attacked on grounds of testamentary incapacity and undue influence. The trial judge found in favour of the will but his judgment was reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench. The sister and the nephew appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench found that the medical evidence as to the physical and mental condition of the deceased at the time the will was executed coupled with the circumstances surrounding the preparation and execution of the will, were sufficient to raise a prima facie presumption of incapacity; that the burden of establishing capacity to have made the will was therefore shifted to the defendants; and that the latter had failed to discharge that burden. These findings should not be disturbed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Pr\u00e9vost J. Appeal dismissed.\nM.

The will is attacked upon grounds of testamentary incapacity and undue influence.\nThe learned trial judge found in favour of the will but his finding was unanimously reversed on appeal2. The impugned will, in the form derived from the laws of England, was made some four days prior to the testator's death in hospital following an operation, and is a short one. It reads as follows:\nJe l\u00e8gue tous mes biens, meubles et immeubles, sans exception ni r\u00e9serve, \u00e0 ma s\u0153ur Eug\u00e9nie Gu\u00e9rin, veuve non remari\u00e9e de Ad\u00e9lard Foisy.\nJe r\u00e9voque tous autres testaments que j'ai pu faire avant ce jour.\nJe nomme mon neveu, Edouard Foisy, comme mon seul ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire.\nIf valid, the will revoked another will made by the deceased in authentic form on January 26, 1954, before I. R. Lavoie and colleague, notaries. Under the terms of this notarial will the testator after providing for certain particular legacies to the respondent Maurice Gu\u00e9rin and the respondents Paul B\u00e9chard and Marguerite B\u00e9chard, children of a deceased sister, named as his residuary legatees the appellant Madame Foisy and the children of two other sisters who had predeceased the testator.\nThe facts are fully set forth in the judgments of the learned trial judge and in the Court below. For the purpose of this appeal they can be shortly stated.\nIn 1954 the deceased Joseph Samuel Gu\u00e9rin was 87 years of age. He was a bachelor and for many years prior to August 1954 had been living in furnished lodgings. Early in August 1954, following a visit with relatives near Mont Laurier, he went to reside in the home of his sister, one of the appellants.\nHe had suffered for some time from diabetes, for which he was treated with insulin, was hard of hearing, and almost blind. Near the end of September 1954 he developed a serious infection in the form of an abscess on one of his buttocks.\nHis physician Dr. Louis Lamarche was called in to see him on September 27, 1954, and thereafter saw him every day until his death, with the exception of Sunday, October 3. Dr. Lamarche called in consultation a surgeon, Dr. Wilfrid Perrault, who visited the deceased for the first time on the afternoon of October 2, 1954. He recommended that an operation be carried out in hospital as soon as possible. The deceased was admitted to the Maisonneuve Hospital that same evening. Dr. Perrault visited his patient in hospital the next day Sunday, October 3, operated on him the following day Monday October 4, and thereafter saw him each day until his death early in the morning of October 6.\nThe circumstances surrounding the preparation and execution of the impugned will must be ascertained largely from the evidence given by the appellant Edouard Foisy. According to Foisy, the deceased suddenly, between 5 and 6 p.m. on Saturday, October 2, expressed to him the desire to make a new will. Foisy then consulted by telephone a friend or acquaintance of his, one Etienne Duval, a notary, but the latter apparently refused to come to the Foisy home, pleading other engagements. Foisy testified however that Duval offered to advise him and did advise him over the telephone as to how a will in the English form should be drafted. No attempt was made to get in touch with the testator's own notary, and no reason was given for the failure to do so.\nFoisy also telephoned to a friend, one Jean Loranger, who came to the Foisy house accompanied by another friend, one Jean-Paul Paquette, and these two acted as witnesses to the impugned document. This document was written out by Loranger in Foisy's room from a draft prepared by the latter, and after this had been done the three then entered the deceased's room. Apparently the appellant Madame Foisy and one of her daughters were also present at this time. After the document had been read to the deceased by Foisy, he signed it in the presence of the witnesses Loranger and Paquette. All this appears to have taken place between six and eight o'clock on the evening of October 2nd.\nEvidence as to the physical condition and mental attitude of the deceased was given by Dr. Lamarche and Dr. Perrault. It is clear from their testimony that the deceased was a very sick man, suffering from chronic diabetes and uremia, complicated by a severe diabetic abscess. As to his mental attitude, Dr. Lamarche testified that when he saw him on the morning of October 2 he found him \"un peu h\u00e9b\u00e9t\u00e9\". Dr. Perrault when he saw the deceased that afternoon stated that he was \"plus ou moins conscient\".\nThe records of the Maisonneuve Hospital of the admission and treatment of the deceased were received in evidence as an exhibit at the trial by consent of both parties. Dr. Gervais, the interne who examined the patient on admission had recorded\u2014\"Le patient est sourd et r\u00e9pond tr\u00e8s mal aux questions\".\nDr. Julien Pesant, a specialist in diabetes\u2014who had not seen the patient\u2014was examined as an expert, and gave as his opinion based upon the medical record of the deceased, that by reason of his age and physical condition \"il pouvait \u00eatre certainement un petit peu omnibul\u00e9 .\u2026 un peu dans les nuages\".\nTestamentary capacity was considered by this Court in L\u00e9ger v. Poirier3. In the judgment of the majority delivered by Rand J., the leading cases were examined and that learned judge said at p. 161:\nBut there is no doubt whatever that we may have testamentary incapacity accompanied by a deceptive ability to answer questions of ordinary and usual matters: that is, the mind may be incapable of carrying apprehension beyond a limited range of familiar and suggested topics. A \"disposing mind and memory\" is one able to comprehend, of its own initiative and volition, the essential elements of will-making, property, objects, just claims to consideration, revocation of existing dispositions, and the like; this has been recognized in many cases: \u2026\nMerely to be able to make rational response is not enough, nor to repeat a tutored formula of simple terms. There must be a power to hold the essential field of the mind in some degree of appreciation as a whole.\nThat statement has been approved subsequently by this Court in Mathieu et al. v. St. Michel4; McEwen v. Jenkins5; and Hayward v. Thompson6.\nThe medical evidence in the case at bar, taken by itself was not perhaps sufficient to establish a prima facie case of testamentary incapacity. That evidence, however, must be considered in conjunction with the surrounding circumstances. These included such matters as (1) the unseemly haste in the preparation and execution of the will; (2) the fact that no attempt was made to obtain independent advice from the deceased's own notary, who had acted for him for many years, and before whom he had recently executed a will in authentic form; and (3) the absence of any satisfactory explanation as to why the deceased should suddenly have decided to bequeath all his property to one sister\u2014 with whom he had recently come to reside\u2014and to disinherit his brother and the other immediate relatives benefited under the notarial will.\nThe Court below found that the medical evidence as to the physical and mental condition of the deceased at the time the will was executed and the circumstances surrounding its preparation and execution, were sufficient to raise a prima facie presumption of incapacity, that the burden of establishing capacity to have made the will was therefore shifted to appellants, Russell v. Lefran\u00e7ois1, and that they had failed to discharge that burden. In my opinion those findings should not be disturbed.\nIt should be added, perhaps, that the judgment of the learned trial judge did not depend upon any finding as to credibility. Even accepting that the deceased knew and approved of the contents of the will as it was put to him immediately before execution, as my brother Judson has pointed out in Hayward v. Thompson, supra, at p. 557, this still leaves untouched the quality of the judgment that he was able to bring to bear on the making of a will.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the defendants, appellants: Nadeau, Villeneuve & Pigeon, Montreal.\nAttorney for the plaintiffs, respondents: Emile Poissant, Montreal.\n1 [1961] Que.

Stevenson, in his Quality as Attorney in Canada for the Non-Marine Underwriters at Lloyds, London, referred to in Lloyd's Policy of Aviation Insurance No. Ca 93410X and Orion Insurance Co. Ltd. (Defendants) Respondents.\n1962: February 8, 9; 1962: May 7.\nPresent: Locke, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nInsurance\u2014Aviation\u2014Policy covering loss or damage to aircraft\u2014Clause providing for exclusion of coverage if terms of Certificate of Airworthiness violated\u2014Term of certificate prohibiting carriage of passengers\u2014Crash of aircraft while passenger aboard\u2014Risk excluded. A policy of insurance covering an aircraft owned by the plaintiff company contained a clause providing for exclusion of liability if such aircraft was operated in violation of the terms of the airworthiness certificate issued by the Department of Transport. A term of the certificate was that flight crew, mechanic or survey operators only were to be carried in the aircraft during flight. In the policy \"passenger carrying\" was included in the definition of \"private business and pleasure\" which was one of the uses for which the aircraft was insured. On a test flight, during which a 15-year old boy was carried as a passenger, the plaintiff's pilot engaged the plane in various acrobatics in the course of which it crashed. The pilot and his passenger were killed and the plane was totally destroyed. An action brought by the plaintiff to recover indemnity in respect of the aircraft was allowed by the trial judge, but, on appeal, the Court of Appeal by a majority set aside this judgment and dismissed the action. The plaintiff then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Locke and Abbott JJ.: The restrictive terms of the airworthiness certificate were material to the risk and should have been disclosed by the plaintiff when applying for the insurance.\nPer Locke, Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.: The risk was excluded while the aircraft was carrying a passenger contrary to the provisions of the certificate, by reason of the exclusion clause in the policy.\nPer Ritchie J.: By the provisions of the exclusion clause in the policy, a flight, during which any of the terms of the Certificate of Airworthiness were being violated, was excluded from the coverage. As the plaintiff did not disclose the terms of the certificate there could be no ground for the suggestion that the inclusion of passenger liability coverage or any other provision of the policy could have the effect of overriding the provisions of the exclusion clause and the Certificate of Airworthiness.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing by a majority a judgment of Sullivan J. Appeal dismissed.\nD. McK. Brown, Q.C., and D. E. Jabour, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nW. J. Wallace and H. Housser, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of Locke and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nLocke J.:\u2014In this action the appellant sought to recover from the respondent Stevenson, as attorney in Canada for the Non-Marine Underwriters at Lloyd's, and from the respondent company, indemnity in respect of the damage suffered by it in the crash and burning of an aircraft near Prince George, B.C., on June 25, 1956. The insurance contract upon which recovery is sought against Stevenson is embodied in a document described as a Certificate of Aviation Insurance dated April 27, 1956, signed by Hansen and Rowland, Inc., an American corporation, in which that company certified that it had procured insurance on the terms specified from underwriters at Lloyd's, London, upon three airplanes, the property of the appellant, including a Lockheed P.38, upon the terms and conditions stated. At a later date, Orion Insurance Co. Ltd. issued a policy to the appellant, insuring 10.46 per cent of the risk upon the same terms.\nThe action was tried before Sullivan J. who gave judgment for the appellant against both of the defendants, but that judgment was set aside by a judgment of the Court of Appeal[2] and the action dismissed, Desbrisay C.J.B.C. dissenting.\nThe business of the appellant company, as stated on the face of the certificate, is the making of aerial surveys which involves taking photographs at heights approximating 35,000 ft. The aircraft in question was engaged in such work at Prince George, being operated for the appellant by Frank Pynn, a qualified and licensed pilot. The work upon which he was engaged at the time in question was carrying out high altitude aerial surveys of terrain lying to the north of Prince George.\nOn the day of the accident, Pynn proposed to take the plane from the Prince George Airport and make what was apparently a test flight for the purpose of checking the intercommunicating radio with which it was equipped. Some work had been done on this at Pynn's request by Allan F. Clarke, the radio operator of the Department of Transport at the airport. Pynn asked Clarke if he would like to go up with him while this was being done but the latter declined and suggested that his son, some 15 years old, might like to go. As a result, the boy was carried as a passenger and while the plane was flown, at first, to a considerable height after it left the airport, thereafter it was flown by Pynn at a very low altitude over Prince George and engaged in various acrobatics, including flying upside down, when it crashed. Pynn and young Clarke lost their lives and the plane was totally destroyed. Under the provisions of s. 4 of the Aeronautics Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 2, the Minister of Transport is authorized, subject to the approval of the Governor in Council, to make regulations to control and regulate air navigation over Canada, including the licensing of pilots and defining the conditions upon which aircraft may be used or operated.\nRegulation 210 of the Air Regulations, made pursuant to this power which were applicable at the relevant times, provided that no person shall fly an aircraft unless there is in force in respect of such aircraft a Certificate of Airworthiness issued under such regulations and unless all conditions upon which a certificate or permit was issued have been complied with.\nRegulation 211 provided that the Minister may establish standards of airworthiness for aircraft including, inter alia, requirements in respect of any matter relating to the safety of such craft and, upon being satisfied that an aircraft conforms to the standards of airworthiness established in respect of it, may issue a certificate to be known as a Certificate of Airworthiness. Subsection (6) of Regulation 211 provided that a Certificate of Airworthiness should contain such conditions relating to the equipment, maintenance and operation of the aircraft as may be prescribed by the Minister.\nThe Certificate of Airworthiness obtained, upon the application of the appellant, for the aircraft in question was issued by the Air Services Branch of the Department of Transport on June 24, 1954. The category of the aircraft was described as being \"Normal (restricted)\". \"Normal category\" was described under a sub-heading reading \"Classification of Aircraft by Employment\" as including public transport for passengers, mails and goods, private purpose aircraft and aerial work other than in respect of the first three mentioned uses. A separate category, the nature of which was described, was designated Acrobatic Category. Below these categories the following appeared:\nAircraft in normal category are precluded from evolutions causing abrupt changes in altitude.\nOn page 3 of the certificate, under a general heading reading \"Precautions To Be Taken For Safety In Navigation\", appeared, inter alia:\n2. Valid for aerial survey only.\n3. Flight crew, mechanic or survey operators only to be in the aircraft during flight. The certificate issued to the appellant described its occupation as aerial surveys. In the space reserved for the description of the purpose for which the aircraft would be used appeared the following:\nSee endorsement No. 1, paragraph No. 6, section \"A\" & \"E\" private business & pleasure & serial (sic) surveys.\nThe word \"serial\" should presumably have read \"aerial\". The endorsement referred to defined the expression \"private business and pleasure\" as including, inter alia, passenger carrying not for hire or reward.\nOn the face of the certificate there appeared the following:\nThe insurance afforded hereunder is made in consideration of the declaration herein made and payment of premiums herein provided and subject to the limits of liability, exclusions, conditions and other terms of this certificate and\/or policy, and is only with respect to such and so many of the following coverages as are indicated by specific premium charge or charges. The limit of the insurer's liability as to each such coverage shall be as stated herein, subject to all the terms and conditions of this Certificate and\/or Policy having reference thereto.\nEndorsement No. 3, forming part of the certificate, included under the risks covered, passenger liability to an amount of $100,000.\nThe insuring agreements were stated with particularity on the second page of the certificate and these were followed by a series of exclusions from the risks. Of these, the principal one to be considered, read with the context, is as follows:\nThis certificate and\/or policy does not cover any liability:\u2014\n(J) While in flight occurring: While the terms of the Civil Aeronautics Administration Airworthiness Certificate, or Operations Record of the insured Aircraft are violated, or while with the consent of the Assured the terms of the pilot's certificate are being violated.\nLiability was denied by the insurers and this action was commenced on June 28, 1957. The original statement of defence was filed on October 31, 1957, and it is evident from its terms that the respondents' solicitors were at that time unaware of the restrictions upon the use of the plane imposed by the airworthiness certificate, as no mention was made of that document. The appellant had filed a proof of loss dated August 23, 1956. This contained no mention of these restrictions or, in the description of the accident, that the aircraft had been destroyed while engaging in acrobatics. Thereafter, the respondents became aware of the terms of the certificate and an amended defence setting up, inter alia, the defence that the aircraft was carrying a passenger and engaging in acrobatics at the time the accident occurred, was filed. In addition, the non-disclosure of the terms of the certificate when applying for the insurance and when filing the proofs of loss was raised as a defence.\nAgreeing as I do with Sheppard J.A. that the term of the certificate that flight crew, mechanic or survey operators only were to be carried in the aircraft applied to all flights, whether aerial surveys or otherwise, and that exclusion (J) of the policy applied, these terms of the airworthiness certificate were material to the risk and should have been disclosed by the appellants when applying for the insurance. The evidence is clear that there was no such disclosure.\nMr. D. V. Magee was the manager of the Aviation Insurance Department of Hansen and Rowland, Inc. at the time the insurance was applied for and the certificate issued. While there had been a written application for policies previously issued, there is no mention of any in respect of the certificate in question. Magee said that he did not inquire as to the terms of the airworthiness certificate when deciding to issue the certificate insuring against passenger hazard, the reason apparently being that he assumed that the applicant would not be applying for insurance protection against a risk which it was not authorized to assume. As he put it, the insurers relied upon the exclusion clauses in the certificate.\nAt the trial, the respondents tendered the evidence of the witness Spexarth who was experienced in aviation insurance underwriting and he was asked whether, if he had known of the terms of the airworthiness certificate to which reference has been made, he would have undertaken the risk. The question was intended obviously to obtain the opinion of the witness as to whether these restrictive terms were, in his opinion, matters which he would consider to be material in deciding whether or not to recommend that the risk be undertaken. The evidence was objected to and excluded. It was clearly admissible, in my opinion (Phipson on Evidence, 9th ed., p. 404, and the cases there cited). However, the evidence, while admissible, was unnecessary since the materiality of this information is in this matter obvious. The learned trial judge who found for the plaintiff proceeded upon the ground that the defendants had failed to satisfy the onus resting upon them to prove that the loss was within the exclusions in the certificate. He was of the opinion that the evidence of Magee showed that there had been no failure by the applicants to make full disclosure, a conclusion with which, with great respect, I am unable to agree. The restrictive terms of the airworthiness certificate were admittedly not communicated.\nSheppard J.A. held that the risk was excluded while the aircraft was carrying a passenger contrary to the provisions of the airworthiness certificate, by reason of the exclusion clause (J) above quoted. Davey J.A. agreed that the action should fail upon this ground. I respectfully agree with this conclusion and with the reasons assigned for it by Sheppard J.A.\nI see no ambiguity in the language of the exclusion clause or of the terms of the airworthiness certificate to which I have referred. In view of this conclusion, I find it unnecessary to deal with the various other defences raised, such as the legal consequences of the failure to disclose the material facts referred to when applying for the insurance and when filing the proofs of loss.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nMartland J.:\u2014I concur with my brother Locke in expressing agreement with the conclusion reached by Sheppard J.A., with which Davey J.A. agreed, that the risk was excluded while the aircraft was carrying a passenger, contrary to the provisions of the Certificate of Airworthiness, by reason of the exclusion created by clause (J) of the exclusions from the risks covered by the insurance contract. I would dispose of this appeal in the manner proposed by him.\nJudson J.:\u2014I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissing this action on the ground which is common to the reasons of Davey and Sheppard JJ.A., namely, that the plaintiff's pilot was operating the aircraft contrary to clause (3) of the Certificate of Airworthiness by carrying a passenger.\nRitchie J.:\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by my brother Locke in which the circumstances of the unfortunate accident which gave rise to this litigation are fully outlined, and I agree that the matter should be disposed of in the manner proposed by him.\nI would dismiss this appeal on the common ground taken by Mr. Justice Davey and Mr. Justice Sheppard that the coverage afforded by the policy sued upon did not include any loss occurring while a passenger was being carried in the insured aircraft.\nBy the provisions of s. 2A of Endorsement No. 1 to the policy now sued upon (hereinafter called \"Exclusion J\"), a flight, during which any of the terms of the Certificate of Airworthiness issued by the Department of Transport in respect of the insured aircraft are being violated, is excluded from the coverage.\nThe terms of the paragraph numbered 3 of clause D of the Second Part of the Certificate of Airworthiness have the effect of limiting the capacity of this aircraft during flight to \"Flight Crew, Mechanic or Survey Operators\", and I agree that when this paragraph is read in conjunction with Exclusion J the effect is to exclude the aircraft from coverage under the policy while carrying passengers, but it is contended on behalf of the appellant that the inclusion of \"Passenger Carrying\" in the policy definition of \"PRIVATE BUSINESS AND PLEASURE\" which is one of the uses for which the aircraft was insured should be read as overriding this exclusion or at least as creating an ambiguity which is to be resolved in the appellant's favour.\nIn the present case, however, the terms of the Certificate of Airworthiness were not disclosed to the insurers, and Mr. D. V. Magee, one of the appellant's witnesses, who was the manager of the Aviation Insurance Department of Hansen & Rowland, Inc., general agents for the insurers, at the time when the terms of the policy were negotiated with Rush & Upton Limited, insurance brokers, who were agents for the appellant, testified that if he had known that carrying passengers was in violation of the terms of the Certificate of Airworthiness he would either have refused the premium for passenger liability carriage or taken it upon himself to modify the provisions of Exclusion J so as to extend the coverage. It is apparent to me, however, that as the appellant did not disclose the terms of the Certificate there can be no ground for the suggestion that the inclusion of passenger liability coverage or any other provision of the policy can have the effect of overriding the provisions of Exclusion J and the Certificate of Airworthiness.\nThe argument of counsel for the appellant is founded in large measure on the proposition which is stated in his factum in the following terms:\nExceptions or exclusionary clauses are to be construed strictly against the Insurer, and in case of doubt or ambiguity the wording is to be construed in accordance with the principle of contra proferenlum.\nThe extent of the exclusion for which provision is made in Exclusion J is governed by the terms of the Certificate of Airworthiness, and it is, therefore, contended that \"the underwriters have brought into play the same interpretation of the certificate as would apply to the policy.\"\nUnder the so-called principle of contra proferentum, ambiguities in insurance policies are, in appropriate cases, construed in favour of the insured on the ground that the insurers have selected the wording of the policy and that they are, therefore, not to be entitled to the benefit of any genuine doubts created by their own draftsmanship which cannot be resolved by employing the ordinary rules of construction. In my view the principle was correctly stated by Lord Sumner in London and Lancashire Fire Insurance Company v. Bolands, Limited[3], and the following language in my opinion has direct application to the present case:\nIt is suggested further that there is some ambiguity about the proviso, and that, under the various well-known authorities, upon the principle of reading words contra proferentes, we ought to construe this proviso, which is in favour of the insurance company, adversely to them. That, however, is a principle which depends upon there being some ambiguity\u2014that is to say, some choice of an expression\u2014by those who are responsible for putting forward the clause, which leaves one unable to decide which of two meanings is the right one. In the present case it is a question only of construction. There may be some difficulty, there may be even some difference of opinion, about the construction, but it is a question quite capable of being solved by the ordinary rules of grammar, and it appears to me that there is no ground for saying that there is such an ambiguity as would warrant us in reading the clause otherwise than in accordance with its express terms. (The italics are mine.)\nIt is clear that the principle is limited in its application to cases in which the ambiguity has been created by words which the insurers have themselves selected and its force is very considerably weakened when it appears that the wording of the policy has been arrived at, as it was in the present case, as the result of negotiation between the insurers and a broker for the insured. In any event, I cannot see that the principle could have any application to the terms of a document such as the Certificate of Airworthiness in the present case which was at all times in the possession of the insured and the wording of which was not selected by the insurers but was unknown to them because the insured failed to disclose it. I do not find any ambiguity in the combined effect of clause J of the policy and the provisions of the Certificate of Airworthiness, but if such ambiguity existed, the contra proferentum rule could not, in my opinion, be applied to the Certificate.\nAs I have indicated, I would dispose of this appeal as proposed by my brother Locke.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Russell & Dumoulin, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the defendants, respondents: Bull, Housser, Tupper, Ray, Guy & Merritt, Vancouver.\n[1] (1961-62), 36 W.W.R. 446, 30 D.L.R.

(Defendant) Respondent.\n1962: May 2; 1962: June 25.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Locke, Cartwright, Martland and Judson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.\nCriminal law\u2014Appeal by way of stated case\u2014Whether questions of law raised\u2014Whether necessary facts before the Court\u2014Whether proper procedure.\nThe appellant, who had been an employee of the respondent, laid an information under The Employment Standards Act, 1957 (Man.), c. 20, charging that the respondent had unlawfully failed to pay him overtime rates. When the matter came before the magistrate, he, without hearing any evidence, ordered the charges dismissed on the grounds that the information was for an offence which took place more than six months before the time when the proceedings were commenced and that the information was void for duplicity and could not be amended. On appeal by way of a stated case, the respondent moved in the Court of Appeal, before any hearing on the merits, to dismiss the appeal upon grounds that the stated case did not raise a question of law; that the stated case was defective in form in that it did not contain a statement of facts sufficient to enable the Court to come to a decision of the question of law; and that the appellant's proper procedure was not to appeal by way of stated case but to move for a mandamus to compel the magistrate to exercise his jurisdiction. By a majority decision the motion was allowed and the stated case quashed. Pursuant to special leave, the appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the order of the Court of Appeal set aside.\nThe rules of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba which prescribed what was to be contained in a case stated under the Code were made by the Judges of the Court of Appeal under the powers vested in them by the Code on May 13, 1930. The case in the present matter complied with these requirements.\nThe points referred to in the stated case were matters of law which had in fact been dealt with by way of written submissions to the magistrate. Every fact necessary to decide the questions of law was before the Court and the points of law were arguable upon the face of the information itself. As to the objection that the proper procedure was not by way of stated case but by mandamus to compel the magistrate to exercise his jurisdiction, this was not the case of a magistrate declining to enter upon a hearing because he was of the opinion that he had no jurisdiction, but one in which, exercising his jurisdiction, he had dismissed the information on grounds of law which appeared to him sufficient.\nThe motion to dismiss or quash the stated case, as it was expressed, should have been dismissed and the questions of law, which were clearly raised, determined.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba1, which dismissed an appeal from a decision of Police Magistrate Kyle dismissing an information laid under The Employment Standards Act, 1957 (Man.), c. 20. Appeal allowed.\nD. Gibson, for the complainant, appellant.\nG. A. Higenbottam, and R. B. Goodwin, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nLocke J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought by special leave of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba2 which dismissed the appeal of the present appellant from a decision of Police Magistrate Kyle of the Provincial Police Court, dismissing an information laid against the respondent under the provisions of The Employment Standards Act, 1957 (Man.), c. 20. At the request of the present appellant, the magistrate stated a case under the provisions of s. 734 of the Criminal Code. The respondent moved before the Court of Appeal to \"quash or dismiss the appeal\" and it was upon this motion that the appeal to that Court was dismissed and, accordingly, the questions of law propounded were not considered.\nSection 27 of The Employment Standards Act provides that no employer shall require or permit an employee to work or be on duty for more than 8 hours in a day and, if a male employee, for more than 48 hours in any week unless in place of the rate of wages ordinarily paid the employer pays him overtime rates for each hour in excess of these limits the employee is required or permitted to work.\nSection 14 declares, inter alia, that every person who contravenes any provision of the Act is guilty of an offence and, if no other penalty is by the Act provided, is liable on summary conviction to a fine, in the case of an employer, of $500, and to imprisonment or to both. By subs. (2), where the contravention continues for more than one day, the person is guilty of a separate offence for each day that it continues.\nSection 16(2) provides that in default of payment by an employer of wages found to be due by him, the magistrate may issue his warrant to levy the amount of the wages and costs by seizure and sale of the goods and chattels of the employer.\nProsecutions for offences under this statute are subject to the provisions of The Summary Convictions Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 254. By s. 7 of that Act, Part XV of the Criminal Code applies and, inter alia, the present s. 693(2). This provides that no proceedings may be instituted more than six months after the time when the subject-matter of the proceedings arose.\nThe information charges the respondent with having permitted Dressier\nto be on duty for more than eight hours on various days between the 9th day of February, AD. 1959 and the 28th day of November, A.D. 1959; and between the 6th day of April, A.D. 1960 and the 18th day of May, AX). 1960, did (sic), on the 18th day of May AX). 1960, unlawfully fail to pay to the said Walter Dressier, overtime rates for each hour or part of an hour in excess of the said eight hours worked on the said days in place of the rate of wages ordinarily paid to the said Walter Dressier, contrary to the provisions of the Employment Standards' Act R.S.M. 1957, Chap. 20. The matter came before the magistrate on November 21, 1960, and, without hearing any evidence, he ordered that the charges be dismissed on the following grounds, namely that:\n(1) The Information was defective in that it disclosed the occurrence of an offence the subject matter of which took place in part more than six months before the time that the proceedings were instituted\n(2) The Information was void for duplicity and not capable of being amended.\nThe respondent moved in the Court of Appeal, before any hearing on the merits, to dismiss the appeal upon grounds only three of which require consideration, namely, that the stated case did not raise a question of law: that the stated case was defective in form in that it did not contain a statement of facts sufficient to enable the Court to come to a decision of the question of law: and that the appellant's proper procedure was not to appeal by way of stated case but to move for a mandamus to compel the magistrate to exercise his jurisdiction.\nThe learned Chief Justice of Manitoba, with whom Schultz and Guy JJ.A. agreed, considered that the stated case was defective in not disclosing that the dismissal was made on preliminary objections without hearing evidence: that the facts upon which the magistrate based his ruling that the information was void for duplicity and not capable of being amended were not set out in the case as stated: that while reference was made to the information the case did not state what evidence was offered by way of admission of facts or otherwise to contradict or support the charges made and that there was not a sufficient disclosure of the grounds upon which the magistrate based his decision. Accordingly, he considered that the stated case should be quashed. The learned Chief Justice, while mentioning an objection raised that the stated case should not have been entitled \"In the Court of Appeal\", considered that it was unnecessary to deal with it.\nIn the dissenting judgment of Tritschler J.A. (now C.J.Q.B.), with whom Freedman J.A. agreed, there is a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the contents of certain affidavits filed before the Court of Appeal by the parties which described what had taken place before the magistrate and the manner in which the stated case had been approved before being signed by him and its terms are stated in extenso. The rules of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba which prescribe what is to be contained in a case stated under the Code were made by the Judges of the Court of Appeal under the powers vested in them by the Code on May 13, 1930 (see the Canada Gazette, June 7, 1930, vol. 63, p. 4464). The case in the present matter, in my opinion, complies with these requirements.\nDealing with the objections advanced in the respondent's motion to the Court, Tritschler J.A. said in part:\nAs to ground 1, that the stated case does not raise a question of law: Defendant's counsel submits that what the magistrate decided were questions of fact; it was a matter of knowing the calendar and applying simple mathematics; he had only to count back from August 15, 1960. the date of the information, to certain dates mentioned in the information or to count forward from those dates to August 15 and see if the period exceeded 6 months; if there was an error it was an error of calculation; as to the alleged duplicity of the information, it was simply a question of counting the charges and if there was an error it was a mistake of counting. I found it difficult to believe, and still do, that these submissions could be seriously put forward. The points involved were matters of law which had in fact been dealt with by way of written submissions to the magistrate by solicitors for both sides. The complainant's position as outlined in his factum to us is: that the six months' limitation period is not applicable because the Legislature has \"otherwise specially provided\" (The Summary Convictions Act, R.S.M. 1954, Cap. 254, Sec. 7); that employment at overtime is not an offence but the offence is failure to pay for overtime; the offence takes place at termination of employment if overtime wages are left outstanding; sec. 14(2) of The Employment Standards Act makes the non-payment for overtime a continuing offence; if the six months' limitation was applicable and part of the offence took place six months prior to the date of the information, the magistrate should not have dismissed the information but should have allowed recovery in respect of that part of the wages claimed which were earned and not paid within a period of six months before the date of the information; there was one offence and not two and it occurred on May 18, 1960; in any event the magistrate had the right under sec. 704 of the Code to permit amendment.\nAnd again:\nEvery fact necessary to decide the questions of law is before the Court. As appears from what has been said under the head of ground 1, the points of law are arguable upon the face of the information itself. The learned Magistrate's question (i) raises the issue whether \"the Information was defective in that it disclosed\", etc. The only fact necessary here is the Information itself, which is fully set out in the case. Question (ii) raises the issue whether the Information was void for duplicity. Here again the Information is the only fact required. Obviously what the learned Magistrate said is that, looking at the Information alone, he could see duplicity in it; that it showed duplicity on its face. No amount of facts other that the Information could be relevant here. Whether the Information was capable of amendment is pure law. As to the objection that the proper procedure was not by way of stated case but by mandamus to compel the magistrate to exercise his jurisdiction, he pointed out that this was not the case of a magistrate declining to enter upon a hearing because he was of the opinion that he had no jurisdiction, but one in which, exercising his jurisdiction, he had dismissed the information on grounds of law which appeared to him sufficient.\nWith these conclusions I agree and, with the greatest respect for the contrary opinion of the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba, I consider that the motion of the respondent to dismiss or quash the stated case, as it was expressed, should have been dismissed and the questions of law, which appear to me to be clearly raised, determined.\nIf it were the opinion of the Court that any clearer statement of the questions of law to be determined was required, the proper course, in my opinion, was to send the case back to the magistrate for amendment and to deliver judgment after it had been amended under the powers contained in s. 740 of the Criminal Code.\nI would allow this appeal and set aside the order of the Court of Appeal with costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal, to be paid by the respondent to the appellant in any event of the appeal forthwith after taxation.\nAppeal allowed, the order of the Court of Appeal set aside and the matter returned to that Court to be dealt with on the merits. Respondent to pay in any event costs in this Court and costs in the Court of Appeal.\nSolicitors for the complainant, appellant: Mitchell & Green, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Monk, Goodwin, Higenbottam & Goodwin, Winnipeg.\n1 (1961), 35 W.W.R. 452, 131 C.C.C. 48, 36 CR. 227, 29 D.L.R.

The company became bankrupt in 1953 and the appellant trust company was appointed trustee. In 1952 Lodestar purchased a half interest in a farmout agreement in consideration of its undertaking to drill a certain well. The estimated cost of drilling the well was more than the company wanted to risk and it therefore sold one-half of its own one-half interest for $27,500. It treated the sum so received as a capital receipt. For the year ending March 31, 1952, Lodestar declared an income of $114,916.05, and for the year ending March 31, 1953, its return showed a loss of $3,516. On September 30, 1953, it filed an amended return for 1952 claiming as a deduction for that year the loss incurred in 1953. On April 28, 1955, the Minister re-assessed the company for the taxation year 1952, adding the $27,500 to the declared income for that year and disallowing part of the 1953 loss previously claimed. In June 1955 the trustee in bankruptcy, after the company's accounts were revised to provide for additional capital cost allowance not previously claimed, filed amended returns for the fiscal years 1952 and 1953, in which a loss of $52,958.57 alleged to have been incurred in 1953 was claimed as a deduction from the 1952 income.\nOn the two issues raised, i.e., (i) whether the item of $27,500 was properly added to the income by the notice of re-assessment and (ii) whether in June 1955 the trustee could claim an additional capital cost allowance for 1953 so as to increase the loss to be carried back to 1952, appeals by the trustee to the Tax Appeal Board and the Exchequer Court failed. On appeal to this Court a third issue, not dealt with in the reasons of either the Tax Appeal Board or the Exchequer Court, was raised. Close to the time when the company sold the half interest in the farmout agreement, it also purchased an interest in a farmout agreement in the State of Nebraska. It was contended that the amount paid by the company to acquire the latter interest was chargeable against income. Held (Taschereau and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed in part.\nPer Locke, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: The $27,500 received by Lodestar in 1952 was realized from the sale of a capital asset and was not income in its hands. There was nothing in the evidence to support the view that the sale of half the company's interest in the farmout was an activity in the nature of a trade in such properties within the meaning of that expression in s. 139(e) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, as amended. Irrigation Industries Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1962] S.C.R. 346, referred to. This was an isolated transaction, the company not having purchased or sold properties of this nature during the thirteen years of its life. Western Leaseholds Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1960] S.C.R. 10, distinguished.\nPer Taschereau and Judson JJ., dissenting: Lodestar made no capital investment in the acquisition of the farmout interest. The company, whose business was the drilling of oil and gas wells for others, undertook, in this particular case, to spend its own money to drill on its own account. What it undertook to do was to spend approximately $55,000 in drilling expenses to find out whether there was oil or gas on the property. These drilling expenses being more than the company wished to incur, the receipt of $27,500 before undertaking any development was really a reduction of drilling costs in advance of drilling, with the result that this item was properly included in the company's income.\nPer curiam: The second amended return for 1952 having been filed outside the time limit provided by s. 42 (4A), enacted by 1951 (Can.), c. 51, s. 14, the Minister was under no compulsion to act on it. If a taxpayer wishes to carry back business losses, he must file his amended return within the statutory time limit. Otherwise, the Minister cannot be compelled to accept the amended return.\nUpon the evidence, the purchase by Lodestar of the interest in the Nebraska property was simply a capital investment and, accordingly, was not a proper charge against the company's income.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Dumoulin J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, dismissing an appeal from a decision of the Tax Appeal Board. Appeal allowed in part, Taschereau and Judson JJ., dissenting.\nF. R. Matthews, for the appellant.\nR. L. Fennerty, Q.C., and F. J. Dubrule, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJudson J. (dissenting in part):\u2014The appellant is the trustee in bankruptcy of Lodestar Drilling Company Limited, which made an assignment in bankruptcy in October 1953. The appeal is against a re-assessment of the income of the bankrupt company for the fiscal year 1952. Appeals to the Income Tax Appeal Board and the Exchequer Court2 have been dismissed.\nThe company was incorporated to carry on the business of drilling petroleum and natural gas wells. For the year ending March 31, 1952, it declared an income of $114,916.05. For the year ending March 31, 1953, its return showed a loss of $3,516. On September 30, 1953, it filed an amended return for 1952 claiming as a deduction from income for that year the loss of $3,516 incurred in 1953. The result was that the amended return showed a taxable income for 1952 of $111,400.05 instead of $114,916.05.\nOn April 28, 1955, the Minister re-assessed the company for the taxation year 1952 at $141,342.90. The increase was brought about by the addition to income of a disputed receipt of $27,500 and the disallowance of part of the 1953 loss previously claimed.\nIn June 1955, the trustee in bankruptcy, following the receipt of the notice of re-assessment in April 1955, filed amended returns for the fiscal years 1952 and 1953. For the 1953 fiscal year the trustee in bankruptcy claimed an additional sum of $51,855.42 for capital cost allowance. This brought the total loss for that year to $52,958.57. The trustee then claimed to apply this 1953 loss against the 1952 income of $141,342.90, bringing the revised income down to the figure of $88,384.33.\nTwo issues are raised in this appeal:\n1. Whether the item of $27,500, being the proceeds of a sale of an interest in a farmout agreement which the company had taken from Trans Empire Oils Limited, was properly added to income by the notice of re-assessment.\n2. Whether in June 1955 the trustee could claim an additional capital cost allowance for 1953 so as to increase the loss to be carried back to 1952. It is on both these grounds that the appeal has hitherto failed.\nGround 1. In February 1952 Lodestar purchased through its president an interest in a farmout agreement from Trans Empire Oils Limited. The terms of the purchase were that Lodestar would drill a test well within a certain time and to a certain depth at its sole risk and expense, and would thereby earn an undivided half interest in the Trans Empire lease. In the same month, February 1952, Lodestar made an agreement with Reality Oils Limited to assign a half interest in this farmout for a sum of $27,500. Lodestar proceeded to drill the test well at its own expense and found nothing. The enterprise was abandoned and no further drilling was done on these lands. The substance of the transaction is that Lodestar purchased a half interest in a lease in consideration of its undertaking to drill a certain well; that the estimated cost of drilling this well was more than the company wanted to risk and that it therefore sold one-half of its own one-half interest for $27,500, leaving itself still subject to the obligation to pay the full cost of drilling. The Minister held that this receipt of $27,500 was income from a business within the meaning of ss. 3, 4 and 127(1)(e) of the 1948 Income Tax Act.\nThis company was in the business of drilling oil and gas wells for others. In this particular case it undertook to spend its own money to drill on its own account. It made no capital investment in the acquisition of this property. What it undertook to do was to spend approximately $55,000 in drilling expenses to find out whether there was oil or gas on the property. These drilling expenses being more than the company wished to incur, the receipt of $27,500 before undertaking any development was really a reduction of drilling costs in advance of the drilling. This is the Minister's view and I think it is the correct one.\nThe company's contention that it bought a capital asset, namely, a half interest in an oil lease, which half interest was more than it wanted, fails. It was not buying a capital asset; it was not making a capital investment; it was undertaking to drill for oil at its own expense. By selling a part interest it reduced its cost of drilling. There is really no analogy between this situation and one where a purchaser wants to buy a limited parcel of land and must acquire more because of the vendor's determination. The sale of surplus land, in some such circumstances, might well give rise to a capital receipt. But that is not this case. This company was in the business of drilling for gas and oil. It was carrying on its business when it purchased the interest from Trans Empire Oils Limited. Its sale of the half interest in the interest to be acquired merely reduced the cost to be incurred for drilling. These costs were chargeable against income under the provisions of the Income Tax Act and they were actually so charged for the year 1952. This branch of the appeal fails.\nGround 2. I have noted above that the company filed its first amended return for the fiscal year 1952 in September 1953. The next amended return was filed after June 27, 1955. This was for the purpose of carrying back the vastly increased capital cost allowance which had arisen as a result of a rewriting of the company's books on instructions from the trustee in bankruptcy after receipt of the notice of re-assessment. The relevant section of the Act as it then stood was s. 42(4A) enacted by c. 51, s. 14, Statutes of Canada 1951. This reads:\nWhere a taxpayer has filed the return of income required by section 40 for a taxation year and, within one year from the day on or before which he was required by section 40 to file the return for that year, has filed an amended return for the year claiming a deduction from income under paragraph (d) of subsection (1) of section 26 in respect of a business loss sustained in the taxation year immediately following that year the Minister shall re-assess the taxpayer's tax for the year.\nThe second amended return filed in 1955 does not qualify under this section. When the Minister re-assessed in April 1955, he had before him only the original return and the first amended return. He was under no compulsion to act on the second amended return filed after the notice of re-assessment. Both the Income Tax Appeal Board and the Exchequer Court have so held. The mere fact of a re-assessment in 1955 does not open the matter of taxability at large and compel the Minister to re-assess in accordance with an amended return made out of time, according to the above quoted section. Under this legislation, if a taxpayer wishes to carry back business losses, he must file his amended return within the statutory time limit. Otherwise the Minister cannot be compelled to accept the amended return.\nThe appellant also raised a third point which has not been dealt with either in the reasons of the Tax Appeal Board or those of the Exchequer Court. Close to the time when the company sold the half interest in the farmout agreement above dealt with, it also purchased an interest in a farmout in the State of Nebraska. This was exactly the converse of the present case. The vendor in the State of Nebraska was obligated to do the drilling and Lodestar was the purchaser in this case of the interest. It happens that it expended $27,500 for the purchase of this interest. The identity of the two figures is entirely accidental. Lodestar says that the receipt from Reality and the disbursement for the Nebraska property must both be treated in the same way. If the receipt in question in the re-assessment was income, then the disbursement for the Nebraska property is also chargeable against income. Conversely, if the Nebraska disbursement is capital, the receipt from Reality must also be capital. There is some appearance of logic in this argument but I think that the two transactions are easily distinguished in character on the ground\n(a) that the disputed receipt came from a sale that was made to reduce drilling costs to be incurred and was in substance a contribution by a co-adventurer to those drilling costs;\n(b) that there is no evidence to indicate that Lodestar is entitled to a deduction in the amount of $27,500 in respect of the Nebraska property on the ground that such sum was laid out by the taxpayer for the purpose of gaining or producing income within the meaning of s. 12(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Locke, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nLocke J.:\u2014The agreement entered into between Trans Empire Oils Ltd. and William Ford on an unspecified date in February 1952, recited that the company was the lessee from the Crown of the petroleum and natural gas rights in Section 31, Township 50, Range 21, West of the Fourth Meridian. This instrument, referred to as a farmout agreement, obligated Ford to commence before February 10, 1952, to drill and carry to completion the drilling of a test well on Legal Subdivision 4 of that section and to continuously thereafter drill until the well was carried to completion. Completion was defined as drilling to a depth sufficient to adequately test the Viking sands, or to a depth where commercial production was found, or to a depth where granite or other impenetrable formation was encountered. In the event that petroleum substances were encountered in quantities sufficient to justify an attempt to place the well on production, Ford agreed at his own expense to take the necessary steps to do this. In the event the well was drilled to completion in accordance with these terms it was declared that the Trans Empire Company should be deemed to hold the lease in trust for the use and benefit of Ford, to the extent of an undivided one-half interest in all zones down to the depth to which the well was completed for the remainder of the term of the lease, Ford to be thereafter liable for one-half of the rentals. In the event that the well was productive of petroleum substances, Ford was to be entitled to receive and retain the net proceeds of the production until such time as he had received a sum equivalent to the drilling costs and completion costs of the well. Various other contingencies dealt with by the instrument are irrelevant to the point to be decided.\nBy an agreement made between Ford and Lodestar Drilling Company Ltd. on an unstated date in February 1952, the former assigned all his interest in the farmout agreement to the Lodestar Company, the latter agreeing to indemnify him against the performance of his obligations under that instrument.\nThe agreement between the Lodestar Company and Reality Oils Ltd. also made on an unstated date in February 1952, after reciting that under the farmout agreement assigned to the Lodestar Company by Ford that company was entitled to acquire an undivided one-half interest in the Crown lease hereinbefore mentioned, declared that Lodestar assigned to the Reality Company \"the full undivided one-half interest in the said Farmout Agreement dated the day of February, A.D. 1952, together with the ful undivided one-half share or interest in all benefits, rights and advantages, subject to the further provisions of this Agreement, which may be derived by Lodestar thereunder in and to the petroleum and natural gas in the hereinbefore recited lands.\" Lodestar further covenanted to commence and to drill the well to completion and that, if petroleum were found in quantity sufficient to justify production, to fulfil the obligations undertaken by Ford in the farmout agreement and that, after Lodestar had recovered its costs of drilling from the production, the share of the proceeds to which Lodestar should be entitled should be owned by the parties in equal undivided one-half shares.\nThe Lodestar Company had been incorporated by memorandum of association on March 16, 1949, under the provisions of The Companies Act of Alberta. By he memorandum its objects were declared to include, inter alia, carrying on the business of contractors for operating, working, drilling and repairing oil wells and to acquire rights or other interests in wells, claims and places which might seem to be capable of producing petroleum, carbon oils, gas or other mineral substances, and to develop, sell or otherwise deal with the same.\nThe only witness giving evidence as to the activities which had, in fact, been carried on by the company between the time of its incorporation and the relevant dates was the witness Ford who had been with the company throughout and was, at the time the farmout agreement was entered into, the president and manager. These activities had been carried on in Saskatchewan and Alberta and, with a named exception in the year 1951, had been entirely the drilling of oil and gas wells for others. The exception was that on August 1, 1951, the company had entered into an agreement with Matlo Oils Ltd. and R. R. Dillabaugh, whereby the parties agreed to drill a well on property described in a farmout agreement made by the Lodestar Company, as trustee for the three parties, with Imperial Oil Ltd., the parties agreeing to contribute in defined proportions to the cost of the drilling operations and to the division of any benefits between them in like proportions. The company had not at any time dealt in the purchase and sale of oil or other mineral rights to others.\nAccording to Ford, and there is no contradiction of his evidence, the agreement made by him with the Trans Empire Company was entered into in the hope that, through the discovery of oil, it would produce a steady income for the Lodestar Company. Ford apparently controlled the operations of the company and as the anticipated cost of drilling the well on the farmout in question was about $55,000 he considered this was too big an investment for the company and, accordingly, sold the half interest to the Reality Company for the sum of $27,500.\nIt was only upon the company drilling the well to completion, as defined, that it became entitled to the specified one-half interest and, at the time the agreement was made with the Reality Company, the company had an equitable interest only in the leasehold interest referred to. The leasehold interest of the Trans Empire Oils Ltd. was an interest in land and the interest of the Lodestar Company at the time of the sale to the Reality Company was a right to acquire such an interest. On the face of it, the acquisition of such an interest made for the purpose of obtaining revenue is in the nature of a capital investment.\nIn the result, when Lodestar drilled the well to completion no production was obtained and the well and the leasehold interest were abandoned. These circumstances do not, however, affect the disposition to be made of this case.\nUnlike the arrangement made in the preceding year by the Lodestar Company with Matlo Oils Ltd. and Dillabaugh, there was nothing in the nature of a joint venture between Lodestar Company and the Reality Company for drilling the well and the fact that the purchase price paid by the latter for the half interest in the property apparently was used to pay part of the drilling costs which, in the result, amounted to some $60,000 is an irrelevant circumstance.\nUpon the evidence this was an isolated transaction, the Lodestar Company not having purchased or sold properties of this nature during the thirteen years of its life. The learned trial judge, in deciding that the payment received was income in the hands of the present appellant, relied upon the decision of this Court in the case of Western Leaseholds Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue3, where the judgment of Cameron J. in the Exchequer Court was confirmed. With respect, however, the circumstances in the present matter are quite different, there being in that case a series of dealings in the oil rights of that company conducted in a variety of manners which extended over a period of several years, which the trial judge had found as a fact to be part of its business operations and a carrying on of a business of disposing of such rights.\nIn the present matter there is nothing in the evidence to support the view that the sale of this half interest was an activity in the nature of a trade in such properties, within the meaning of that expression in s. 139(e) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, as amended. I refer to the review of the authorities dealing with the necessity of showing an adventure in the nature of a trade to be found in the judgment of my brother Martland in the case of Irrigation Industries Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue4.\nIn my opinion, the $27,500 received by the Lodestar Company from Reality Oils Ltd. was realized from the sale of a capital asset and was not income in its hands.\nI have had the advantage of reading the judgment to be delivered in this matter by my brother Judson and I agree with him that the second amended return filed by the trustee in 1955 does not qualify under s. 42(4A), enacted by Statutes of Canada 1951, c. 51, s. 14.\nAs to the purchase by the Lodestar Company of the half interest in the Nebraska property, upon the evidence this appears to have been simply a capital investment and, accordingly, not a proper charge against the company's income.\nI would allow this appeal in part and refer the assessment back to the Minister to delete from the assessment the sum of $27,500 received by the Lodestar Company from Reality Oils Ltd.\nAs the appellant has succeeded on the principal issue argued before us, in my opinion, it should have its costs in this Court and in the Exchequer Court.\nAppeal allowed in part with costs, Taschereau and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Allen, MacKimmie, Matthews, Wood, Phillips & Smith, Calgary.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

The city council refused to approve the plan as it considered that these dwellings could not be erected pursuant to the building bylaw then in force. In December 1951, the plaintiff submitted a formal application for a permit to erect 3 to 4-storey apartment houses. This application was turned down by the building inspector and the council. Two days later the plaintiff applied for a writ of mandamus. The writ was granted in July 1952, and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench in October 1953. A month later, the city told the plaintiff that he could obtain his permit at the offices of the city. The plaintiff did not call for his permit, but instituted the present action against the city for damages. He alleged that economic conditions had changed to an extent where his earlier plans had now become impossible of execution. He alleged further that the members of the council had discriminated against him and had shown bad faith. The city denied these allegations and pleaded that prior to the judgment on the mandamus its building bylaw had always been interpreted in good faith as permitting the erection of dwellings of only two stories or less. The Superior Court awarded damages, and this judgment was affirmed by a majority in the Court of Queen's Bench. The city appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the, action dismissed.\nGood faith is always presumed and bad faith must be proved. On the question as to whether the city had acted in good faith, this Court Was not bound by the judgment rendered in the action for mandamus but by the proof submitted in the present action, since the judgment on the mandamus was founded on the interpretation of the bylaw without having to take into consideration the question of the good or bad faith of the council. In the present case, neither the evidence nor the bylaw disclosed any circumstances permitting to infer bad faith on the part of the council. The loss of profits which were claimed were occasioned by changes in economic conditions and delays in Court proceedings, for which the city could not be held liable. It was not an abuse of the judicial process for the city to defend its interpretation of the bylaw in the action for mandamus. The plaintiff had therefore no cause of action. Rules of equity existing in the common law have no application in the Quebec law. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Deslauriers J. Appeal allowed.\nF. Mercier, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nJ. G. Ahem, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014Propri\u00e9taire d'un vaste terrain situ\u00e9 dans les limites de la Ville Saint-Laurent et mesurant quelque 425,000 pieds carr\u00e9s, l'intim\u00e9 projeta, au cours de 1951, d'utiliser 30 p. cent de cette superficie pour y \u00e9riger un nombre de maisons-appartements de sept \u00e0 huit \u00e9tages et 70 p. cent pour l'\u00e9tablissement de jardins, de terrains de jeux, etc. Son architecte \u00e9crivit, le 1er juin de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, au Conseil municipal de l'appelante pour lui faire part de ce projet et en demander une approbation de principe Le Conseil consid\u00e9ra cette demande avec les rapports du g\u00e9rant et de l'ing\u00e9nieur de la ville. Il jugea qu'en raison du r\u00e8glement de construction, le r\u00e8glement num\u00e9ro 145, il ne pouvait permettre sur le site en question les constructions projet\u00e9es. Le g\u00e9rant de la ville communiqua cette d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l'architecte de l'intim\u00e9 et, tout en lui exprimant ses regrets, l'avisa que le Conseil \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer tous autres projets qu'on pourrait d\u00e9sirer soumettre pour le site en question.\nLe 12 d\u00e9cembre suivant, l'intim\u00e9 fit une demande formelle de permis, adress\u00e9e \u00e0 l'inspecteur de construction et remise \u00e0 M. Chagnon, ing\u00e9nieur de la ville, cumulant vraisemblablement cette fonction d'inspecteur. Il ne s'agissait plus du m\u00eame, mais d'un nouveau projet; les maisons-appartements \u00e0 construire n'ayant que trois \u00e0 quatre \u00e9tages et la superficie du terrain engag\u00e9 n'\u00e9tant que de 125,800 pieds carr\u00e9s. Cette demande de permis fut refus\u00e9e par M. Chagnon et par le Conseil municipal. (Voir paragraphe 8 de la d\u00e9claration de l'intim\u00e9).\nLe 14 d\u00e9cembre 1951, soit deux jours apr\u00e8s la date de cette demande de permis, l'intim\u00e9 fit \u00e9mettre un bref de mandamus pour contraindre l'appelante \u00e0 lui \u00e9mettre ce permis. Cette action fut contest\u00e9e et subs\u00e9quemment maintenue par jugement rendu par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure le 8 juillet 1952. La Ville Saint-Laurent en appela et, le 27 octobre 1953, la Cour d'Appel confirma le jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure. Apr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 de se pourvoir \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada \u00e0 rencontre de cette d\u00e9cision, l'appelante avisa les procureurs de l'intim\u00e9, le 24 novembre 1953, qu'elle avait renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 ce faire et qu'en cons\u00e9quence ce dernier pouvait se pr\u00e9senter aux bureaux de la ville pour obtenir le permis demand\u00e9 dans l'action sur mandamus. L'intim\u00e9 ne donna pas suite \u00e0 cette invitation.\nPlus de cinq mois plus tard, soit le 26 avril 1954, il prit contre l'appelante l'action qui nous concerne en cet appel pour lui r\u00e9clamer une somme de $228,610.59 \u00e0 titre de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. En substance et au soutien de cette action, l'intim\u00e9 all\u00e9gua, outre les faits ci-dessus, qu'en raison de l'augmentation du co\u00fbt des mat\u00e9riaux, de la main-d'\u0153uvre et du taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat sur les pr\u00eats, ainsi que de la diminution de la demande pour des appartements de ce type, la situation existant lorsque l'appelante lui offrit son permis, soit en novembre 1953, n'\u00e9tait plus la m\u00eame que celle pr\u00e9valant en d\u00e9cembre 1951 lorsqu'il en fit la demande; qu'en raison de ce changement de conditions, son projet de construction ne pouvait plus \u00eatre \u00e9conomiquement r\u00e9alis\u00e9 et que, pour ce motif, il avait d\u00fb en faire l'abandon; que le refus ill\u00e9gal de l'appelante de lui donner son permis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9 par des sentiments de malveillance entretenus \u00e0 son endroit par les membres du Conseil et qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination. L'intim\u00e9 en conclut qu'il avait droit de r\u00e9clamer de l'appelante la somme ci-dessus \u00abas damages suffered by him through the latter's continuous fault lasting from December 12, 1951 to the 24th of November, 1953\u00bb.\nEn d\u00e9fense, l'appelante plaida particuli\u00e8rement l'inexistence des motifs d'hostilit\u00e9 imput\u00e9s aux membres de son Conseil; qu'ant\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision judiciaire rendue sur le mandamus, les dispositions de son r\u00e8glement de construction avaient toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de bonne foi comme limitant \u00e0 des habitations de deux \u00e9tages tous les b\u00e2timents qui pouvaient \u00eatre \u00e9rig\u00e9s dans cette partie de la municipalit\u00e9 o\u00f9 se trouvait le terrain sur lequel l'intim\u00e9 voulait construire des maisons-appartements de trois \u00e0 quatre \u00e9tages et qu'aucun permis n'avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 pour la construction de tels b\u00e2timents \u00e0 cet endroit. La Cour sup\u00e9rieure consid\u00e9ra que cette omission d'\u00e9mettre le permis\u2014ainsi judiciairement reconnue ill\u00e9gale\u2014fit rater le projet de l'intim\u00e9 et jugeant que m\u00eame la bonne foi de l'appelante ne pouvait affecter l'obligation impos\u00e9e par l'art. 1053 C.C. de r\u00e9parer les dommages en d\u00e9coulant, n'eut pas \u00e0 se prononcer sur l'all\u00e9gation de mauvaise foi. La Cour condamna l'appelante \u00e0 payer \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 $14,470.88, somme ainsi inutilement d\u00e9bours\u00e9e par lui en paiement des services rendus par l'architecte, ing\u00e9nieurs et autres, pour travaux pr\u00e9paratoires \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de son projet.\nSeule la ville appela de ce jugement qui fut maintenu par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire de la Cour d'Appel2; MM. les Juges Casey, Rinfret, Montgomery et Badeaux formant la majorit\u00e9 et M. le Juge Choquette \u00e9tant dissident. Cette d\u00e9cision majoritaire repose sur diff\u00e9rentes raisons et il convient de donner la substance de celles qui sont pertinentes au pr\u00e9sent appel.\nM. le Juge Casey, ayant signal\u00e9 que, tel que la cause fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en Cour d'Appel, la question de bonne foi assume une extr\u00eame importance, formule ainsi ses vues:\nIf in their dealings with Respondent the members of Appellant's Council acted in good faith, if their refusal to grant the permit sought resulted from their understanding of the law\u2014and on this point there is room for an honest difference of opinion\u2014I would be inclined to say that their error did not engage Appellant's responsibility for the damage caused. But if they acted in bad faith then I think that Appellant's responsibility was engaged.\nReproduisant alors le texte du paragraphe 9 de la d\u00e9claration o\u00f9 l'intim\u00e9 all\u00e8gue que le refus du permis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9 par des sentiments d'hostilit\u00e9 de la part des membres du Conseil \u00e0 son endroit et qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination, le savant Juge poursuit:\nIn the ordinary course of events the burden of proof would be on Respondent; if this rule were applied here basing myself on what is contained in this record, I would say that the burden had not been discharged and in agreement with Mr. Justice Choquette I would dismiss Respondent's action.\nBut in the earlier case between the same parties (1953 K.B. 792) this same refusal was considered and it is my view that what was decided there carries over to this case with the result that Appellant commenced with a burden, establishing the good faith of its Council, that otherwise it would not have had. As this burden was not discharged I would dismiss this Appeal. M. le Juge Rinfret est aussi d'avis qu'il n'y a, au dossier, aucune preuve des all\u00e9gations du paragraphe 9 et que non seulement la discrimination n'est pas prouv\u00e9e, mais qu'au contraire, il est \u00e9tabli qu'aucun b\u00e2timent, y compris les maisons-appartements, ayant plus de deux \u00e9tages, n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit dans le territoire concern\u00e9. Il ajoute qu'une faute volontaire ne peut \u00eatre imput\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appelante. Il consid\u00e8re cependant que:\nL'excuse de la Ville \u00e0 l'effet qu'elle a toujours interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 son r\u00e8glement comme d\u00e9fendant l'\u00e9rection de b\u00e2timents de plus de deux \u00e9tages ne tient pas au regard du texte clair du par. I de l'art. 77, qui \u00e9tablit explicitement une exception en faveur des maisons \u00e0 appartements et ce partout dans les limites de la ville.\nM. le Juge Montgomery se r\u00e9sume comme suit:\nFor the reasons given by my colleagues Mr. Justice Casey, Mr. Justice Rinfret and Mr. Justice Badeaux, I am of the opinion that the circumstances of Appellant's refusal to issue the building permit indicate that it acted either in bad faith or with such recklessness as to be tantamount to bad faith.\nPour appr\u00e9cier les raisons de M. le Juge Badeaux, il faut pr\u00e9ciser que, pour refuser le permis, l'appelante s'\u00e9tait appuy\u00e9e, non seulement sur ces dispositions valides du r\u00e8glement qui, tel que par elle interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es, justifiaient ad\u00e9quatement son refus, mais aussi sur une autre disposition d\u00e9clar\u00e9e ultra vires par le jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure sur le mandamus qui, sur ce point, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 attaqu\u00e9 en appel. Le savant Juge n'a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 le m\u00e9rite de l'appel dans l'action en dommages qu'au regard de cette disposition ultra vires. Exprimant l'avis que l'appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gligente \u00e0 ne pas se rendre compte de cette invalidit\u00e9, il la d\u00e9clare responsable bien que reconnaissant qu'en fait, elle croyait en la validit\u00e9 de cette disposition. Assumant que ces vues soient fond\u00e9es, ceci ne dispose pas du m\u00e9rite de la d\u00e9fense bas\u00e9e sur l'erreur, commise de bonne foi, dans l'interpr\u00e9tation des dispositions valides. Et vu l'opinion ci-apr\u00e8s sur ce dernier point, il n'y aura pas lieu de revenir sur les raisons du savant Juge.\nDissident, M. le Juge Choquette, ayant consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance reconnaissait la bonne foi de l'appelante, s'exprime ainsi sur la question:\nCette bonne foi n'est pas infirm\u00e9e du fait que l'appelante a exerc\u00e9 un droit, celui de contester les proc\u00e9dures de l'intim\u00e9 et d'en appeler du jugement qui les a accueillies, ni du fait d'un arr\u00eat (Sun Oil v. Cit\u00e9 de Verdun) qui ne para\u00eet pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 \u00e0 sa connaissance. D'ailleurs, cet arr\u00eat ne s'applique que partiellement au litige m\u00fb entre les parties. Quant \u00e0 l'erreur d'interpr\u00e9tation, elle en est une que tout conseil municipal aurait pu commettre de bonne foi (C. E. Campeau, p. 164 sv). Durant vingt ans l'appelante avait interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 son r\u00e8glement de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, sans exception pour personne, et sans opposition de qui que ce soit. Si son erreur en est une que les tribunaux ont pu corriger en vertu de l'art. 50 C.P., elle n'en est pas une, \u00e0 mon avis, qui donne ouverture \u00e0 l'action en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nIl convient de d\u00e9terminer, en premier lieu, si les membres du Conseil et les officiers de l'appelante ont agi de bonne foi.\nLa bonne foi se pr\u00e9sume toujours et c'est \u00e0 celui qui all\u00e8gue la mauvaise foi de la prouver. (Art. 2202 C.C.). En tout respect, le jugement sur le mandamus n'affecte pas l'op\u00e9ration de ces principes, en l'esp\u00e8ce. La d\u00e9cision finale sur le mandamus fut fond\u00e9e juridiquement sur l'interpr\u00e9tation du r\u00e8glement et, pour en d\u00e9terminer le sens et la port\u00e9e v\u00e9ritables, la Cour n'avait pas, en cette cause, \u00e0 s'occuper de la question de savoir si les membres du Conseil et les officiers de l'appelante avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 de bonne ou de mauvaise foi en en faisant eux-m\u00eames l'interpr\u00e9tation. C'est l'interpr\u00e9tation et non l'exercice d'un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire qui \u00e9tait en question. Il n'y a pas identit\u00e9 d'objet entre le jugement sur le mandamus et celui \u00e0 rendre en la pr\u00e9sente cause. Pour les fins de ce dernier jugement, cette Cour n'est pas li\u00e9e par celui qui fut prononc\u00e9 sur le mandamus. Beach v. The Township of Stanstead3. C'est donc au regard de la preuve faite en la pr\u00e9sente cause que la question de la bonne ou mauvaise foi de l'appelante doit \u00eatre r\u00e9solue.\nLa preuve au dossier ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le, \u00e0 mon avis, aucunes circonstances permettant d'inf\u00e9rer mauvaise foi. Le r\u00e8glement lui-m\u00eame, en raison d'une r\u00e9daction imparfaite, pour ne pas dire contradictoire, ne saurait non plus justifier une telle inf\u00e9rence. Jusqu'au jour o\u00f9 sa port\u00e9e fut judiciairement d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par le jugement final sur le mandamus, ce r\u00e8glement, comme l'indiquent MM. les Juges Casey et Choquette, pouvait en toute sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u00eatre honn\u00eatement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de la fa\u00e7on dont il l'avait toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 jusqu'alors par l'appelante.\nAinsi donc, ayant, de bonne foi, interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 son r\u00e8glement et soumis cette interpr\u00e9tation aux tribunaux, qui ne l'ont pas accueillie, l'appelante doit-elle, pour cette raison, \u00eatre tenue responsable des dommages subis par l'intim\u00e9 par suite de l'abandon de son projet en raison du changement des conditions \u00e9conomiques, changement progressivement survenu au cours du d\u00e9bat sur le mandamus et qui, \u00e0 la conclusion de ce d\u00e9bat, se serait av\u00e9r\u00e9 fatal au projet. Suivant l'interpr\u00e9tation que l'appelante entretenait, avant qu'il en soit jug\u00e9, avait-elle le droit d'accorder le permis? Assumant qu'en raison de l'adjudication subs\u00e9quente sur la question, son refus d'\u00e9mettre le permis lorsque demand\u00e9, deux jours \u00e0 peine avant l'\u00e9mission du bref de mandamus, doive \u00eatre maintenant consid\u00e9r\u00e9 r\u00e9trospectivement comme ill\u00e9gal et constituer en outre une faute engendrant responsabilit\u00e9, cette faute n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 active ou g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice du dommage dont se plaint l'intim\u00e9. Ce qui fit rater son projet, c'est le changement des conditions \u00e9conomiques survenu au cours de la longue dur\u00e9e des proc\u00e9dures sur le mandamus. Ce changement, comme la lenteur de la marche de la justice, ne peuvent \u00eatre imput\u00e9s \u00e0 l'appelante. Aussi bien, la question fondamentale qui se pose dans les circonstances de cette cause est-elle de savoir si l'appelante a commis une faute engageant sa responsabilit\u00e9 en soumettant, de bonne foi, ses pr\u00e9tentions \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision des tribunaux par sa contestation du mandamus.\nAgir en justice, que ce soit en demande ou en d\u00e9fense, ne constitue pas une faute. C'est un droit. Tous les arr\u00eats de la Cour de cassation, dit Savatier, s'accordent \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre que l'action en justice, c'est-\u00e0-dire le droit de soumettre au Juge ses pr\u00e9tentions, est un droit dont l'exercice n'entra\u00eene, en principe, aucune responsabilit\u00e9, m\u00eame si ces pr\u00e9tentions sont \u00e9ventuellement rejet\u00e9es. Ce principe comporte des exceptions en cas d'abus de ce droit l\u00e9gal reconnu \u00e0 tout justiciable ciable. C'est ainsi que l'exercice de ce droit peut d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rer en faute susceptible d'entra\u00eener une condamnation en dommages int\u00e9r\u00eats s'il constitue un acte de malice, de mauvaise foi ou s'il est tout au moins le r\u00e9sultat d'une erreur grossi\u00e8re \u00e9quipollente \u00e0 dol. Savatier, Trait\u00e9 de la responsabilit\u00e9 civile en droit fran\u00e7ais, tome I, p. 83, nos 65 et seq.; Colin et Capitant, Droit civil fran\u00e7ais, tome 2 (1948), p. 238, no 326; et H. et L. Mazeaud, Responsabilit\u00e9 civile d\u00e9lictuelle et contractuelle, 4e \u00e9d., tome I, p. 559, no 591.\nCette th\u00e9orie de l'abus du droit ne d\u00e9roge pas mais est conforme \u00e0 l'\u00e9conomie de la loi sous l'art. 1053 C.C. Suivant la doctrine classique, le fait invoqu\u00e9 au soutien de l'action en dommages sous cet article doit, outre d'\u00eatre dommageable au demandeur et imputable au d\u00e9fendeur, \u00eatre en soi un fait illicite. L'exercice d'un droit, s'il n'y a pas d'abus, ne constitue pas un fait illicite. Les dispositions de l'art. 893 C.P.C. offrent un exemple de l'application de ces principes. Ces dispositions prescrivent que le renvoi d'aucune des mesures provisionnelles adopt\u00e9es contre la personne ou les biens d'un d\u00e9fendeur, ne donne \u00e0 ce dernier un recours en dommages que s'il prouve absence de cause raisonnable et probable dans la poursuite de ces voies extraordinaires.\nCes consid\u00e9rations suffiraient, \u00e0 mon avis, pour conclure que l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9tabli avoir une cause d'action contre l'appelante.\nS'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire d'\u00e9lever la question au plan du droit public pour consid\u00e9rer les d\u00e9fenses possiblement ouvertes \u00e0 un gouvernement municipal, je dirais que l'intim\u00e9 n'a cit\u00e9 et que je n'ai pu trouver aucune d\u00e9cision accordant des dommages int\u00e9r\u00eats dans un cas identique \u00e0 celui qui nous occupe. Les d\u00e9cisions suivantes supportent, au contraire, l'opinion oppos\u00e9e. Beach v. The Township of Stanstead, supra; Malouin v. Cit\u00e9 de Drummondville4; Municipal District of Springbank v. Render5; The City of Belleville v. Moxam and Wood6. Dans cette derni\u00e8re cause, les d\u00e9fendeurs, ayant obtenu un permis de construire, avaient commenc\u00e9 l'ex\u00e9cution des travaux lorsqu'il fut constat\u00e9 que ce permis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis sans droit. La ville prit une injonction pour arr\u00eater l'ex\u00e9cution de ces travaux. La Cour accorda une injonction permanente. Cette injonction fut accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la condition que la ville paie d'abord les d\u00e9penses faites par les d\u00e9fendeurs jusqu'au jour de la demande d'injonction. Pour pouvoir se justifier d'imposer cette condition, la Cour dut s'appuyer sur les r\u00e8gles d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 formul\u00e9es et administr\u00e9es par la Court of Chancery pour suppl\u00e9menter aux r\u00e8gles et \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure de la Common Law. Ces r\u00e8gles d'\u00e9quit\u00e9, pr\u00e9valant dans les juridictions de la common law, n'ont pas d'application sous le droit du Qu\u00e9bec. Pour ces raisons, je maintiendrais l'appel, infirmerais les jugements de la Cour du Banc de la Reine et de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, et renverrais l'action de l'intim\u00e9, avec d\u00e9pens dans toutes les Cours.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nAttorney for the defendant, appellant: F.

He objected to the jurisdiction of the Court, and prior to the date set for the preliminary inquiry obtained the issue of a writ of prohibition suspending the proceedings. The Minister, by a declinatory exception, objected to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to issue a writ of prohibition against a Court of criminal jurisdiction in a criminal matter. The exception was dismissed. The Minister obtained leave to appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, but that Court, by a majority decision, found that it had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal on the ground that the judgment dismissing the declinatory exception was a judgment in a criminal matter from which no appeal was provided for under the Criminal Code. The Minister was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the case should be returned to the Court of Queen's Bench.\nThe Superior Court is a Court of civil jurisdiction and its procedures are regulated by the Code of Civil Procedure. Under arts. 170 et seq. of that Code, if the Superior Court has no power ratione materiae to entertain an action brought before it, not only has it jurisdiction to declare itself incompetent, but it is obliged to do so if requested by a party or of its own motion if not so requested. Even if the writ of prohibition should, because it was incidental to a criminal prosecution, be held to be a criminal proceeding, it did not follow that the judgment of the Superior Court on the declinatory exception was a judgment in a criminal matter. The sole issue on the exception was one of competency in the administration of justice and, in the present case, one depending on whether the subject-matter of the action in the Superior Court should be held by that Court to be of a civil or criminal matter. The judgment on the declinatory exception was not a judgment in a criminal matter but one as to the competency of the Superior Court, and therefore, the Court of Queen's Bench had jurisdiction to hear the appeal against that judgment whether or not the matter in which the question was raised was a criminal or civil matter.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, dismissing, for lack of jurisdiction, an appeal from a judgment of Reid J. Appeal allowed.\nR. B\u00e9dard, Q.C., and M. Charbonneau, for the appellants.\nR. Par\u00e9, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014Summoned before the Court of Sessions, in the district of Montreal, to answer seven complaints lodged against him under the Dominion Income Tax Act, respondent, in each of the cases, objected to the jurisdiction of the Court of Sessions and prior to the date set for preliminary inquiry, applied for and obtained in the Superior Court the issuance of a writ of prohibition ordering the suspension of the proceedings in the Court of Sessions.\nIn obedience to the writ of prohibition, appellants appeared in the Superior Court and by a declinatory exception objected to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to issue a writ of prohibition against a Court of criminal jurisdiction in a criminal matter. This exception was dismissed as ill-founded by Reid J.\nAppellants then obtained leave from Bissonnette J. to appeal this judgment of the Superior Court to the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side).\nBy a majority decision, the Court of Appeal2 decided that it had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. This decision rests on the following reasoning. The writ of prohibition issued in this case is incidental to a criminal prosecution and, on the principle of In re Fred Storgoff3, a criminal proceeding; therefore, it is said, the judgment dismissing the declinatory exception is a judgment in a criminal matter; such a judgment is appealable only if an appeal is provided for under the Criminal Code; and since the Criminal Code does not provide in s. 691 for an appeal from a judgment dismissing a declinatory exception but only from judgments granting or refusing the relief sought in proceedings by way of prohibition, the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction.\nCasey J., dissenting, found that this approach of the majority to the question of the jurisdiction of the Court revealed a misunderstanding of the problem presented by the case. He expressed the opinion that whenever the jurisdiction of the Superior Court is questioned, there is an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) from the judgment that maintains or dismisses the declinatory exception and this without regard to the matter in which the question is raised. Being of the view that the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction, he proceeded to consider the merit of the appeal and concluded that it should be maintained.\nAppellants then appealed with leave of this Court from this majority judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nWhen the case was called, counsel for respondent was apprised that the Court desired to hear him at first on the question of the jurisdiction of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side). Having heard counsel on the point, the Court indicating that reasons would be delivered later, rendered judgment maintaining the appeal, declaring that the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) had jurisdiction to hear the appeal from the decision of the Judge of first instance and ordering the case to be returned to the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) so that it may decide whether the Superior Court had jurisdiction to issue the writ of prohibition.\nWith deference to the members of the majority, we are all in respectful agreement with the conclusion reached by Casey J. on the question of jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is the extent and the limit of the power of a Court or of a Judge to entertain an action, petition or other proceeding. The Superior Court is a Court of civil jurisdiction, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 15, Part I, Division II, and the procedures as to that Court are regulated by the Code of Civil Procedure. Sections 170 et seq. of this Code provide, inter alia, that if the Superior Court has no power ratione materiae to entertain an action brought before it, the Superior Court has not only jurisdiction to declare itself incompetent, but is obliged to do so if requested by the defendant or of its own motion if not so requested. Counsel for respondent readily admitted that the Superior Court had jurisdiction to entertain the declinatory exception made by appellants and render a judgment either affirming or negativing its jurisdiction to issue the writ of prohibition. However, he contended that, for the reasons accepted by the majority of the Court of Appeal, the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to review the decision of the Superior Court. It is difficult to reconcile this admission as to the competency of the Superior Court to entertain the declinatory exception made in the matter by appellants under s. 170 C.P.C., and this submission of incompetency of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) to entertain an appeal in the very same matter from the judgment of the Superior Court, under the appellate provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. Even if the writ of prohibition should, because it is incidental to a criminal prosecution, be held to be a criminal proceeding, it does not follow that the judgment of the Superior Court on the declinatory exception is, in the true sense, a judgment in a criminal matter. The sole issue on the exception is one of competency in the administration of justice and, in the present case, one depending on whether the subject-matter of the action initiated in the Superior Court should be held by that Court to be of a civil or a criminal nature. If found to be of a civil nature, the Superior Court is competent to entertain the action and it should dismiss the exception. If found to be of a criminal nature, the Superior Court is incompetent to entertain the action and it should maintain the exception. Were the nature of the subject-matter of the action determining the nature of the judgment to be rendered on the exception, the Superior Court would, in the first alternative, be competent to dismiss the exception and, in the second alternative, incompetent to maintain the same. The acceptance of this contention would render the exception illusory and purposeless. The judgment of Reid J. is not a judgment in a criminal matter but one as to the competency of the Superior Court.\nThat the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) had jurisdiction to hear the appeal against the judgment pronounced in first instance by Reid J. is shown in the reasons for judgment of Casey J.\nThere only remains to indicate that, by agreement of the parties, the judgment rendered in this appeal from the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) in file no. 7638 of the records of that Court, also applies to the other appeals to this Court between the same parties and on an identical question of law.\nAppeal allowed.\nAttorney for the appellant: E.

On July 22, 1953, the respondent mailed a notice of assessment to the appellant, showing its income tax at the figure which had been disclosed in the return. Subsequently, on December 21, 1956, the respondent mailed a notice of re-assessment to the appellant, showing its income tax to be $324,286.36. There were two subsequent notices of re-assessment, on February 13, 1957, and on July 10 of the same year, reducing the appellant's income tax to $308,571.81. The appellant was charged, for that portion of its income tax which was not paid until 1957, interest in the amount of $17,123.57, of which sum $10,488.25 was interest for the period from June 30, 1954, to January 21, 1957.\nThe appellant contended that the notice mailed on July 22, 1953, was a nullity because, before it was mailed and at the time it was mailed, it had been decided by the officers and employees of the Department of National Revenue to conduct a further examination of the appellant's return. Until that intention had been carried out, there had not been an examination of the return, within s. 42(1) of The Income Tax Act, and there was, therefore, no assessment made pursuant to that subsection. If the notice of July 22, 1953, was a nullity, the notice of original assessment would then be that of December 21, 1956, and, accordingly, the appellant, by virtue of s. 50(6), would not be liable for payment of interest for the period from June 30, 1954, being the date twelve months after the date fixed for filing the appellant's return, to January 21, 1957, being the date thirty days after the mailing of the notice of December 21, 1956. Having lost its appeal in the Exchequer Court, the appellant appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe Minister had full authority, under s. 42 of the Act, to assess tax on the basis of the appellant's return and thereafter, if he so decided, to re-assess on the basis of a further examination of that return. The time at which he decided to make that further examination did not, in any way, affect the validity of the initial assessment which he had made and consequently the notice of that initial assessment constituted \"the notice of the original assessment for the taxation year\" within the meaning of s. 50(6).

Appeal dismissed.\nC. M. Leitch, for the appellant.\nD. S. Maxwell, Q.C., and T. Z. Boles, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the learned President of the Exchequer Court2, which dismissed the appellant's appeal against re-assessment of its income tax for the year 1952. It relates solely to the amount of $10,488.25, being a part of the amount of $17,123.57 included in the final assessment for that year as interest upon the appellant's unpaid income tax. The facts are contained in an agreed statement of facts. On June 30, 1953, within the time limited by The Income Tax Act for filing its income tax return, the appellant filed its return for the period ending December 31, 1952. In the return the appellant showed income tax payable in the amount of $240,342.24, which was paid.\nOn July 22, 1953, the respondent mailed a notice of assessment to the appellant, showing its income tax at the figure which had been disclosed in the return. Subsequently, on December 21, 1956, the respondent mailed a notice of re-assessment to the appellant, showing its income tax to be $324,286.36. There were two subsequent notices of re-assessment, on February 13, 1957, and on July 10 of the same year, reducing the appellant's income tax to $308,571.81.\nThe appellant was charged, for that portion of its income tax which was not paid until 1957, interest in the amount of $17,123.57, of which sum $10,488.25 was interest for the period from June 30, 1954, to January 21, 1957.\nWhen the appellant's income tax return had been received in the Calgary District Taxation Office, the mathematical computations which it contained were checked by an assessor. The return was then handed to another assessor, who checked it to ensure that there had not been any errors. Following this, the original notice of assessment was prepared and mailed to the appellant on July 22, 1953. It was admitted that the total time spent by the two assessors working on this return prior to the mailing of the notice of assessment would not exceed fifteen minutes.\nAt the time the first assessor performed his work, he wrote the letter \"R\" in the lower right-hand corner of the first page of the return. This letter is an abbreviation of the word \"Review\" and, by marking the return in this way, it was thereby segregated to ensure that it would be subject to further examination. It is admitted that prior to and at the time the notice of July 22, 1953, was mailed it had been decided by the officers and employees of the Department of National Revenue to conduct a further examination of the appellant's return.\nThat examination was conducted by another assessor prior to December 21, 1956. His work consisted in reviewing the seven exhibits attached to the return and the obtaining of additional information as to the appellant's income for 1952 by an examination of the appellant's books and records and by interviews with officers and servants of the appellant.\nThe only question in issue is as to whether the judgment below was right in holding that the original notice, mailed on July 22, 1953, was \"the notice of the original assessment for the taxation year\" within the meaning of s. 50(6) of The Income Tax Act, 1947-48 (Can.), c. 52, as amended, (later s. 54(6) of c. 148, R.S.C. 1952, and subsequently repealed in 1955).\nThe relevant sections of The Income Tax Act are as follows:\n42. (1) The Minister shall, with all due despatch, examine each return of income and assess the tax for the taxation year and the interest and penalties, if any, payable.\n(2) After examination of a return, the Minister shall send a notice of assessment to the person by whom the return was filed.\n* * *\n(4) The Minister may at any time assess tax, interest or penalties and may\n(a) at any time, if the taxpayer or person filing the return has made any misrepresentation or committed any fraud in filing the return or supplying information under this Act, and\n(b) within 6 years from the day of an original assessment in any other case,\nreassess or make additional assessments.\n(5) The Minister is not bound by a return or information supplied by or on behalf of a taxpayer and, in making an assessment, may, notwithstanding a return or information so supplied or if no return has been filed, assess the tax payable under this Part.\n(6) An assessment shall, subject to being varied or vacated on an objection or appeal under this Part and subject to a re-assessment, be deemed to be valid and binding notwithstanding any error, defect or omission therein or in any proceeding under this Act relating thereto.\n* * *\n50. (6) No interest under this section upon the amount by which the unpaid taxes exceed the amount estimated under section 41 is payable in respect of the period beginning 12 months after the day fixed by this Act for filing the return of the taxpayer's income upon which the taxes are payable or 12 months after the return was actually filed, whichever was later, and ending 30 days from the day of mailing of the notice of the original assessment for the taxation year.\nThe contention of the appellant is that, on the admitted facts, the notice mailed on July 22, 1953, was a nullity because, before it was mailed and at the time it was mailed, it had been decided to conduct a further examination of the appellant's return. Until that intention had been carried out, there had not been an examination of the appellant's return, within s. 42(1), and there was, therefore, no assessment made pursuant to that subsection. If the notice of July 22, 1953, was a nullity, the notice of original assessment would then be that of December 21, 1956, and, accordingly, the appellant, by virtue of s. 50(6), would not be liable for payment of interest for the period from June 30, 1954, being the date twelve months after the date fixed for filing the appellant's return, to January 21, 1957, being the date thirty days after the mailing of the notice of December 21, 1956.\nIn two cases decided in the Exchequer Court in circumstances similar to the present one, it has been decided that an assessment made on the basis of the taxpayer's return, subject only to the checking of the computations made in it, was an assessment within the meaning of The Income Tax Act: Provincial Paper, Limited v. Minister of National Revenue3, and Western Leaseholds Limited v. Minister of National Revenue4. The appellant does not take issue with these two decisions in the present appeal, but seeks to distinguish them on the ground that in the present case the evidence established that the intention to make the further examination of the appellant's return existed before the notice of July 22, 1953, was mailed.\nThe conclusions reached in the first of those two cases and applied in the second are accurately stated in the head-note as follows:\nHeld: That it is not for the Court or anyone else to prescribe what the intensity of the examination of a taxpayer's return in any given case should be. That is exclusively a matter for the Minister, acting through his appropriate officers, to decide.\n2. That there is no standard in the Act or elsewhere, either express or implied, fixing the essential requirements of an assessment. It is exclusively for the Minister to decide how he should, in any given case, ascertain and fix the liability of a taxpayer. The extent of the investigation he should make, if any, is for him to decide.\n3. That the Minister may properly decide to accept a taxpayer's income tax return as a correct statement of his taxable income and merely check the computations of tax in it and without any further examination or investigation fix his tax liability accordingly. If he does so it cannot be said that he has not made an assessment.\nI am in agreement with these propositions. Do they cease to be applicable if, at the time the first notice was mailed, there existed an intention to conduct a further examination of the appellant's return? I do not think that they do. I cannot agree that that which would constitute a valid assessment if not accompanied by a present intention to conduct a further examination is not a valid assessment if that intention does exist. In my opinion there can be a valid assessment made even though a further examination of the return is intended. The examination of the return which was made prior to July 22, 1953, was, in my view, an examination within the meaning of subs. (1) of s. 42. I think the Minister had authority under s. 42 to make the assessment of which notice was given on July 22, 1953. I am reinforced in this conclusion by other subsections of s. 42. Subsection (4) provides that \"the Minister may at any time assess tax \u2026\", subs. (5) empowers him to assess tax notwithstanding a return and subs. (6) provides that an assessment shall be deemed to be valid notwithstanding any error, defect, or omission therein or in any proceeding under the Act relating thereto.\nIn summary, my opinion is that the Minister had full authority, under s. 42, to assess tax on the basis of the taxpayer's return and thereafter, if he so decided, to re-assess on the basis of a further examination of that return. The time at which he decided to make that further examination did not, in any way, affect the validity of the initial assessment which he had made and consequently the notice of that initial assessment constituted \"the notice of the original assessment for the taxation year\" within the meaning of s. 50(6).\nIn my opinion, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Macleod, McDermid, Dixon, Burns, Love & Leitch, Calgary.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

On August 19, 1958, B purchased the defendant ships, then lying in the Port of Halifax, and on the same day entered into a lease-purchase agreement with the plaintiff which provided for the operation of the ships by the latter with an option to purchase. On October 30, 1958, the plaintiff cabled B alleging certain breaches of the terms of the agreement and declaring it to be \"a nullity in its entirety\" although reserving to itself the right to take such action as might be deemed appropriate. On June 9, 1959, B sold the ships to the Republic of Cuba.\nThe plaintiff on August 4, 1960, instituted proceedings in rem in the Nova Scotia Admiralty District by a writ directed to \"the owner and all others interested in the defendant vessels\". On the same day the defendant ships were arrested at Halifax pursuant to a warrant of arrest granted on the application of the plaintiff. The Republic of Cuba as the then owner of the Ships entered an appearance under protest on August 11, 1960, raising the ground that the Court had no jurisdiction, and this was followed by a notice of motion to set aside the writ of summons, the warrant for arrest and the service thereof on the grounds the ships were public national property of and in possession of the Republic which could not be impleaded; and further that by the agreement relating to the use and hire of the ships the plaintiff expressly submitted itself and all questions relating to the agreement to the jurisdiction of the Cuban Courts. Pottier D.J.A. dismissed the application, but an appeal- from this judgment was allowed in the Exchequer Court. The plaintiff then appealed to this Court. Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ: The ships in question were \"public ships\" owned by and in the possession of a foreign sovereign state and were, for this reason, immune from arrest in the Exchequer Court. Although the ships might ultimately be used by Cuba as trading or passenger ships, there was no evidence as to the use which they were destined, and the Court was not in a position to say that these ships were going to be used for ordinary trading purposes. The defendant ships were to be treated as \"the property of a foreign state devoted to public use in the traditional sense\", and the Exchequer Court was, therefore, without jurisdiction to entertain this action.

The Republic was in possession and control of the ships on that date. In the circumstances, the two propositions of international law referred to in Compania Naviera Vascongado v. S.S. Cristina, [1938] A.C. 485 at p. 490, were applicable: (i) the courts of a country will not implead a foreign sovereign, that is, they will not by their process make him against his will a party to legal proceedings whether the proceedings involve process against his person or seek to recover from him specific property or damages; (ii) They will not by their process, whether the sovereign is a party to the proceedings or not, seize or detain property which is his or of which he is in possession or control.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Cameron J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, allowing an appeal from a judgment of the District Judge in Admiralty for the Nova Scotia Admiralty District. Appeal dismissed.\nD. A. Kerr and G. S. Black, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nDonald McInnes, Q.C., and J. H. Dickey, Q.C., for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Cameron J. of the Exchequer Court2, allowing an appeal from a judgment of Pottier J., District Judge in Admiralty for the Nova Scotia Admiralty District, and ordering that the writ and warrant of arrest in this action and the service thereof be set aside on the ground that the Court was without jurisdiction to entertain the action.\nThe appellant company was incorporated in Cuba in 1958 for the taking over and operation of ocean-going ships owned by an autonomous Cuban banking institution named Banco Cubano del Comercio Exterior (hereinafter called \"Banco\"), one of the purposes of which was to promote Cuban trade generally.\nOn August 19, 1958, Banco purchased the seven ships which are the defendants in this action from Canadian National (West Indies) Steamships Limited and on the same day entered into a lease-purchase agreement providing for their operation by the appellant under the usual demise charter terms together with an option entitling the appellant to convert the contract to one of purchase and sale and to apply all rental and charter hire payments theretofore made to the purchase price of each vessel. On October 30, 1958, however, the appellant cabled Banco alleging certain breaches of the terms of the agreement and declaring it to be \"a nullity in its entirety\" although reserving to itself the right to take such action as might be deemed appropriate.\nThere is evidence in the material before us that the defendant vessels became the property of the Republic of Cuba on June 9, 1959, and for the purposes of this appeal the appellant admits that they have since that date\n\u2026 been, owned by various agencies controlled by the Cuban Government, and that Flota has taken no part in the operation of the said vessels \u2026.\nIn fact it appears from the affidavit of John Thompson Campbell, the accountant of G. T. R. Campbell & Company, Marine Surveyors and Consultants at Montreal, that since June 8, 1959, the latter company\n\u2026has supervised the said ships and has submitted its reports and accounts to the Government of the Republic of Cuba represented in this behalf by the Oficina de Fomento Maritimo a division of the Department of Defence and subsequently by the Departmento de Fomento Maritimo a division of the Ministry of Revolutionary Armed Forces, Republic of Cuba.\nIt was not until August 4, 1960, more than a year after Banco had transferred the ships to the Republic of Cuba, that these proceedings in rem were commenced against the defendant ships in the Nova Scotia Admiralty District of the Exchequer Court of Canada. The writ was directed to \"the owner and all others interested in the defendant vessels\" and it bore the following endorsement:\nThe Plaintiff claims against the Defendant Vessels the sum of One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000.00) for injury, loss and damage sustained by the Plaintiff by reason of the breach of a Lease-Purchase Agreement (being an Agreement relating to the use and hire of ships and relating to the Defendant Vessels and others) dated on or about the 19th day of August, A.D., 1958, and for costs, and the Plaintiff claims to have an account taken.\nOn the same day the defendant ships were arrested at the Port of Halifax pursuant to a warrant for arrest granted on the application of the appellant. Although the lease-purchase agreement referred to in the endorsement was a contract between Flota and Banco, the Republic of Cuba as the then owner of the ships entered an appearance under protest on August 11, 1960, raising the ground that the Admiralty Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the action, and this was followed on August 17 by notice of motion to set aside the writ of summons, the warrant for arrest and the service thereof on the following grounds:\n(a) That the endorsement of the Writ of Summons herein discloses no cause of action over which this Honourable Court has jurisdiction.\n(b) That this Honourable Court is wholly without jurisdiction to entertain this action.\n(c) That the said steamships and motor-vessels Defendants herein were at all material times owned by the Republic of Cuba.\n(d).That the said steamships and motor-vessels Defendants herein were and are public national property of and in the possession of and public use and service of the Government of the Republic of Cuba at all times relevant to these proceedings, and cannot be impleaded in this action.\n(e).That the Lease-Purchase Agreement referred to in the Statement of Claim herein as an Agreement relating to the use and hire of ships is an Agreement whereby the Plaintiff expressly submitted itself and all questions relating to the said Agreement to the jurisdiction of the competent Judges and Courts of the Republic of Cuba, renouncing their right to resort to any other jurisdiction by reason of nationality or of domicile or for any other cause whereby this Honourable Court is without jurisdiction, and the Plaintiff herein is estopped from resorting to the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court.\nIt is to be noted that the writ of summons recites the fact that the agreement is one \"relating to the use and hire of ships and relating to the Defendant Vessels and others\" and it is upon this allegation that the appellant bases its right to arrest the defendant vessels, alleging that the Nova Scotia Admiralty District of the Exchequer Court of Canada has jurisdiction in the premises by reason of the provisions of s. 22(xii)(1) of Schedule A to the Admiralty Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 1, and s. 18(3) and (4) of the said Act, which latter section reads as follows:\n(3) Notwithstanding anything in this Act or in the Act mentioned in subsection (2), the Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine\n(a) any claim\n(i) arising out of an agreement relating to the use or hire of a ship,\n(ii) relating to the carriage of goods in a ship, or\n(iii) in tort in respect of goods carried in a ship,\n(b) any claim for necessaries supplied to a ship, or\n(c) any claim for general average contribution.\n(4) No action in rem in respect of any claim mentioned in paragraph (a) of subsection (3) is within the jurisdiction of the Court unless it is shown to the Court that at the time of the institution of the proceedings no owner or part owner of the ship was domiciled in Canada.\nIn the course of his reasons for judgment in the Exchequer Court, Cameron J. made the following comment:\nOn these findings of fact, has the Court jurisdiction to entertain this action\u2014a proceeding in which a Cuban Company claims damages for breach of a contract entered into with another Cuban corporation for the operation of the defendant vessels, and when the ownership, possession and control of the vessels has passed from the second corporation to the Republic of Cuba, or at least to one of its departments of state? It is difficult to see how any such claim could succeed if it went to trial since Flota turned over possession of the ships to Banco which had disposed of them by sale before this action was brought. That matter, however, was not one of the grounds on which this motion to set aside the proceedings was based and was not argued before me, and consequently it is unnecessary to consider that matter.\nBefore this Court Mr. McInnes, on behalf of the respondent, argued that the statutory provision quoted above\n\u2026 is not intended to give jurisdiction with respect to an agreement entered into between two parties relating to ships which at the date of the Writ were owned by and in the possession of a foreign power.\nIt is appreciated that the main question sought to be determined on this appeal is whether or not the doctrine of sovereign immunity extends to protect the defendant vessels from seizure and I propose to deal with the matter on that basis, but, like Mr. Justice Cameron, it is difficult for me to see how any such claim could succeed if it went to trial unless the bona fides of the transfer of the ships to the Republic of Cuba could be successfully attacked because it appears from the material before this Court that at the time when the action was brought the defendant ships were no longer the property of the owner whose alleged breach of contract is the subject-matter of the Claim and the Republic of Cuba was not a party to the agreement for the use and hire of the ships out of which the claim arose. I am not prepared to hold that the provisions of s. 18(3)(a)(i) of the Admiralty Act or s. 22(xii)(1) of its Schedule are effective to create a true maritime lien such as that discussed in Goodwin Johnson Ltd. v. The Ship (Scow) A. T. & B. No. 28 et al.3, attaching from the inception of the claim and travelling with the ships into whosoever's possession they may come, or indeed that those provisions create any kind of a jus in rem capable of being asserted against the ships in the hands of a purchaser for value in good faith whose title antedates the writ of summons and the arrest. (See Goodwin Johnson Ltd. v. The Ship (Scow) A. T. & B. No. 28 et al., supra; Northcote v. Owners of The Henrich Bj\u00f6rn4; The Pi\u00e8ve Superiore5; and Mayers' Admiralty Law and Practice in Canada, 1st ed., 1916, at p. 25.)\nIt is, however, not necessary for me to dispose of the present appeal on this ground because, as will hereafter appear, I have formed the opinion that the ships in question are to be treated for the purpose of this appeal as \"public ships\" owned by and in the possession of a foreign sovereign state and that they are, for this reason, immune from arrest in the Exchequer Court.\nIt has long been recognized that ships of war engaged in the service of a foreign state are to be treated as floating portions of the flag state and that as such in peacetime they are exempt from the jurisdiction of our Courts, and this principle has been extended to include the ships of a foreign state which are used for the public purposes of that state such as mail-carrying packets (The Parlement Belge6) and ships carrying coal for public purposes (The Tervaete7), but the proposition that trading vessels owned and operated by a foreign sovereign state are equally immune from the jurisdiction of our Courts rests in large measure upon the case of The Porto Alexandre8, decided in the Court of Appeal in England in 1920, and upon the minority opinion of Lord Atkin in Compan\u00eda Naviera Vascongado v. S.S. Cristina9. The law as to the immunity from the jurisdiction of our Courts of the property of a foreign sovereign state devoted to the public use of that state is fully discussed in the decisions of this Court in Reference re Powers of the City of Ottawa and the Village of Rockcliffe Park to Levy Rates on Foreign Legations, etc.10, and Municipality of Saint John et al. v. Fraser-Brace Overseas Corporation et al.11.\nThe material before us clearly indicates that at the time of their arrest the defendant ships, although lying idle in Halifax harbour and being equipped as trading or passenger ships, were nonetheless owned by and in possession of a foreign state and were being supervised by G. T. R. Campbell & Company which company was accounting for such supervision to \"a division of the Ministry of Revolutionary Armed Forces, Republic of Cuba\". Although the ships might ultimately be used by Cuba as trading or passenger ships, there is no evidence before us as to the use for which they were destined, and, with the greatest respect for the contrary view adopted by Mr. Justice Pottier who had the benefit of viewing the ships, I nevertheless do not feel that we are in a position to say that these ships are going to be used for ordinary trading purposes. All that can be said is that they are available to be used by the Republic of Cuba for any purpose which its government may select, and it seems to me that ships which are at the disposal of a foreign state and are being supervised for the account of a department of government of that state are to be regarded as \"public ships of a sovereign state\" at least until such time as some decision is made by the sovereign state in question as to the use to which they are to be put.\nIn the case of The Cristina, supra, which has been very fully reviewed in the Courts below, a ship which had been requisitioned by the Government of the Republic of Spain, was arrested at Cardiff at the suit of its former owners and the Government of Spain entered a conditional appearance and moved to set aside the writ, the arrest and all subsequent proceedings on the ground that the Cristina was then the property of a foreign sovereign state. When the case came before the House of Lords it was the unanimous opinion of the Court that the ship was in the actual possession of the Spanish Republic \"for public purposes\" and that the Courts of England were without jurisdiction to arrest it. The majority of the judges in the House of Lords placed their judgments squarely on the ground that the ship was being employed for the public purposes of a sovereign state, and Lord Thankerton, Lord Macmillan and Lord Maugham expressly reserved their opinion on the question of whether such immunity from arrest would have attached to the ship if it had been engaged in trade. Lord Atkin, however, in the course of delivering his minority opinion, recited the following two propositions of international law at p. 490:\nThe first is that the courts of a country will not implead a foreign sovereign. That is, they will not by their process make him against his will a party to legal proceedings, whether the proceedings involve process against his person or seek to recover from him specific property or damages. The second is that they will not by their process, whether the sovereign is a party to the proceedings or not, seize or detain property which is his, or of which he is in possession or control.\nThis statement of the law was approved by Viscount Simonds in Rahimtoola v. Nizam of Hyderabad12, but Lord Atkin went on to say:\nThere has been some difference in the practice of nations as to possible limitations of this second principle as to whether it extends to property only used for the commercial purposes of the sovereign or to personal private property. In this country it is in my opinion well settled that it applies to both.\nThese latter observations which were in accord with the decision of the Court of Appeal in The Porto Alexandre, supra, were not necessary to Lord Atkin's decision, were not approved by Viscount Simonds and, as will be seen, were expressly disowned by the majority of the Law Lords who sat in The Cristina, supra.\nThe opinions of Lord Thankerton, Lord Macmillan and Lord Maugham have been thoroughly examined in the careful decision in both Courts below and it is unnecessary for me to do more than refer to the analysis of the effect of that case made by Viscount Simon, speaking on behalf of the Privy Council, in Sultan of Johore v. Abubakar Tunku Aris Bendahar13, where he said at p. 344:\nAn action in rem against a ship impleads persons who are interested in the ship. That is settled law. There is even high authority for the view that such persons are, or may be, directly impleaded by such proceedings (see The Cristina case per Lord Atkin and per Lord Wright). If, however, it had been definitely determined that in no case could a foreign sovereign be impleaded without his consent, there could have been no justification for reserving the case of a sovereign's ship engaged in ordinary commerce\u2014 a reservation that was in fact made by the majority of the House of Lords in The Cristina. For a sovereign is impleaded by an action in rem against his ship, whether it is engaged in ordinary commerce or is employed for purposes that are more usually distinguished as public. The extent of the impleading is the same in the one case as in the other. Indeed, a great deal of the reasoning of the judgment in The Parlement Belge, 5 P.D. 197, would be inexplicable if there could be applied a universal rule without possible exception to the effect that, once the circumstance of a foreign sovereign being impleaded against his will can be established, a proceeding necessarily becomes defective by virtue of that circumstance alone.\nTo say this is merely to disavow an alleged absolute and universal rule. It does nothing to throw doubt on the existence of the general principle.\nMr. Justice Cameron in the present case appears to have adopted Lord Atkin's view as to the doctrine of absolute sovereign immunity, saying:\nWhile the matter is perhaps not entirely free from doubt, I have come to the conclusion that I should follow the rule as laid down by Lord Atkin in The Cristina and which has been cited with approval by the well-known textbook writer to whom I have referred. It was also followed in a Canadian case, that of Thomas White v. The Ship Frank Dale, [1946] Ex. C.R. 555, by Sir Joseph Chisholm, D.D.J.A.\nWhen reference is made to the decision of Sir Joseph Chisholm, it is found that that learned judge must have been misled by the head-note in The Cristina, supra, at p. 485 because he says:\nIn the Cristina case the Courts held that the immunity claimed extended and applied to ships engaged in trade and belonging to a foreign sovereign State. The desirability of modifying the accepted rule so far as it concerned trading ships was pointed out by some of their Lordships and particularly by Lord Maugham, but the House was of opinion that in the case the immunity was properly claimed. That seems to be the principle applied in the United States: Berizzi Bros. Co. v. S.S. Pesaro, (1926) 271 U.S. 562, and until changed must be accepted by our Court.\nThe fact that the view so expressed by Sir Joseph Chisholm has not been accepted in this Court appears from what is said by Sir Lyman Duff C.J. in Reference re Powers of the City of Ottawa and the Village of Rockcliffe Park to Levy Rates on Foreign Legations, etc., supra, at p. 221, where he had occasion to say:\nParallel with this rule touching the immunity of legations, there runs the principle of the immunity of the property of a foreign state devoted to public use in the traditional sense. In The Parlement Belge supra, it was held that this immunity applies to a ship used by a foreign government in carrying mail. The Supreme Court of the United States has held that it is enjoyed by a ship, the property of a foreign sovereignty and employed by the foreign government for trading purposes. Berizzi Brothers Co. v. S.S. Pesaro, (1926) 271 U.S. 562. It most certainly cannot be said that this is a settled doctrine, in view of the opinions expressed in the Cristina case, although Lord Atkin, who delivered the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Chung Chi Cheung v. The King, [1939] A.C. 160 at p. 175 uses a general phrase:\u2014\nThe sovereign himself, his envoy and his property, including his public armed ships, are not to be subjected to legal process. (The italics are mine.)\nThe implications involved in accepting the opinion which Lord Atkin expressed in The Cristina, supra, at p. 490 as \"settled doctrine\" applicable to state-owned trading ships appear to me to be indicated by the following excerpts from the works of recognized authors on international law.\nIn Oppenheim's International Law, 8th ed., 1955, vol. I, at p. 273, it is said:\n\u2026 the vast expansion of activities of the modern State in the economic sphere has tended to render unworkable a rule which grants to the State operating as a trader a privileged position as compared with private traders. Most States, including the United States, have now abandoned or are in the process of abandoning the rule of absolute immunity of foreign States with regard to what is usually described as acts of a private law nature. The position, in this respect, in Great Britain must be regarded as fluid.\nTo this last sentence the author appends the following note:\nThis is so in particular with regard to foreign public vessels engaged in commerce. In The Cristina [1938] A.C. 485 the majority of the House of Lords expressed views not favourable to immunity from jurisdiction in such cases\u2026.\nDr. Cheshire, who is not customarily addicted to violent language, makes this observation in his recent (6th) edition, 1961, of his work on Private International Law. He says at p. 96:\nThat Sovereign States which engage in the sea-carrying trade should be relieved of the obligations to which private shipowners are subject is unjust, if indeed not preposterous. Moreover, the injustice has been increased by the emergence of welfare and totalitarian States, for the activities of sovereign governments, originally mainly political, have now expanded immeasurably both in extent and scope. With the greatest respect for those who hold a different view, I do not find it necessary in the present case to adopt that part of Lord Atkin's judgment in The Cristina, supra, in which he expressed the opinion that property of a foreign sovereign state \"only used for commercial purposes\" is immune from seizure under the process of our Courts, and I would dispose of this appeal entirely on the basis that the defendant ships are to be treated as (to use the language of Sir Lyman Duff) \"the property of a foreign state devoted to public use in the traditional sense\", and that the Exchequer Court was, therefore, without jurisdiction to entertain this action.\nI would, therefore, dismiss this appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Locke and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nLocke J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of Cameron J., delivered in the Exchequer Court14, allowing the appeal of the Republic of Cuba from the decision of Pottier J., District Judge in Admiralty for the Nova Scotia Admiralty District, which dismissed the motion by the Republic of Cuba to set aside the writ and warrant of arrest issued in this action and service thereof on the ground that the Court was without jurisdiction to entertain the action.\nWhile Pottier J. made no express finding upon the question as to the ownership of the ships, it would appear, as pointed out by Cameron J., that it was his opinion that the claim to ownership by the Republic of Cuba had been established. Cameron J. found as a fact that, as of the time of the issue of the writ and the seizure of the vessels on August 4, 1960, they were the property of the Republic. The evidence, in my opinion, supports that finding.\nIt is not disputed that on August 4, 1960, the Republic of Cuba was a sovereign state recognized by Canada, each of the countries being represented by an ambassador in the other.\nThere is no evidence as to the use to which the Republic of Cuba intended to put the vessels which it had purchased on June 9, 1959, and which, since that time, had been anchored in the Harbour of Halifax. The Republic was in possession and control of the ships on August 4, 1960. In my opinion, the law applicable in these circumstances is as it is stated in Compania Naviera Vascongado v. S.S. Cristina1, in the following terms:\nThe foundation for the application to set aside the writ and arrest of the ship is to be found in two propositions of international law engrafted into our domestic law which seem to me to be well established and to be beyond dispute. The first is that the courts of a country will not implead a foreign sovereign, that is, they will not by their process make him against his will a party to legal proceedings whether the proceedings involve process against his person or seek to recover from him specific property or damages.\nThe second is that they will not by their process, whether the sovereign is a party to the proceedings or not, seize or detain property which is his or of which he is in possession or control.\nIn Rahimtoola v. Nizam of Hyderabad2, Viscount Simonds adopted that statement as accurately stating these proceedings of international law.\nThe question as to whether the law extends to property only used for the commercial purposes of the sovereign does not arise in the present matter and I express no opinion as to it.\nI respectfully agree with the reasons for judgment delivered in this matter by Cameron J. and I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: H.

The parties were unsuccessful in negotiating a new agreement and the matter was referred to a conciliation board. However, no settlement was reached and the union called a strike on April 24, 1961. In a letter dated June 24, 1961, the company informed the striking employees that unless they gave notice by July 15 of their intention either to return to work or to resign they would be dismissed as of July 16, 1961. The employees who refused to so notify the company were advised by a letter of July 18 that they were no longer employees of the hotel. Two complaints were laid by the union, one under ss. 50(a) and 69(1) and the other under ss. 50(c) and 69(1) of The Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, charging the company with (1) unlawfully refusing to continue to employ certain of its employees because they were exercising a right under the Act and (2) unlawfully seeking by threat of dismissal to compel certain of its employees to cease their participation in a lawful strike. The magistrate who heard the case dismissed the two charges. This decision was set aside, on appeal, by the Chief Justice of the High Court, and by a unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal the order of the Chief Justice was affirmed with a variation. Pursuant to special leave, the company appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.: The company\u2019s contention that the striking employees had to terminate their contracts of employment before they could engage in a lawful strike was rejected. The strike was lawful at common law and was not forbidden by the Act. That being so, the effect of s. 1 (2) was (i) to provide that while the strike continued the employees on strike did not cease to be employees of the appellant, and (ii) to prevent the employer from terminating that employer-employee relationship by reason only of the employee ceasing to work as the result of the strike.\nThe strike being a lawful activity of the union, it followed that by virtue of s. 3 of the Act, the striking employees, all of whom were members of the union, had the right to participate in that lawful activity. The participation in the strike by the employees was, therefore, the exercise of a right under the Act.\nPer Locke J.: The case should be decided upon the assumption, as was found below, that the strike was lawful. By virtue of s. 1(2) of the Act each of the strikers was an employee within the meaning of that term in s. 50(c) and was entitled to the protection afforded by it.\nThe letters written by the appellant on June 26 and July 18, 1961, were properly construed as a refusal to continue to employ the employees in question from and after July 16, 1961, by reason of the fact that they continued on strike, and the letter of June 26 as a threat of dismissal if they continued such participation.\nThe contention that the right to strike was expressly given to employees by s. 3 of the Act was rejected. The statute, however, implicitly recognized that employees may lawfully strike by restricting that undoubted right during the period in which conciliation proceedings are being carried on and for a defined period after an award. While the right existed at common law at the time of the passing of The Labour Relations Act, that right was limited and controlled in the circumstances mentioned and was expressly recognized after the expiration of these periods. Striking after complying with the requirements of the statute was exercising a right under the Act within the meaning of that expression in s. 50.\nPer Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The statutory requirements having been complied with, the strike was lawful under the Act. That being so, the letter of June 26 constituted an offence under s. 50(c) of the Act and that of July 18 constituted an offence against s. 50(a).\nThat the strikers must terminate their contracts of employment before there could be a lawful strike under the Act, as argued by the appellant, would make nonsense of an Act which authorizes a certain course of conduct after certain things have been done and which, in addition, expressly preserves the employer-employee relationship by s. 1 (2).\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which affirmed with a variation an order of McRuer C.J.H.C.[1] setting aside a decision of Magistrate Elmore whereby he acquitted the appellant on two charges under The Labour Relations Act. Appeal dismissed.\nW.R. Jackett, Q.C., and G.P. Miller, for the defendant, appellant.\nDavid Lewis, Q.C., and T.E. Armstrong, for the informant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This appeal raises questions of importance as to the meaning and effect of certain provisions of The Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Act\u201d.\nThe appeal is brought, pursuant to special leave granted by this Court, from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which affirmed with a variation an order of McRuer C.J.H.C.[2] setting aside the decision of His Worship Magistrate Elmore whereby he acquitted the appellant on two charges, one of a breach of s. 50(a) and the other of a breach of s. 50(c) of the Act.\nThe order of McRuer C.J.H.C. directed that the matterbe remitted to the magistrate to be dealt with according; to the law as declared in the reasons for judgment. The Court of Appeal varied this direction to provide that the matter be remitted to the magistrate in order that he may register convictions against the appellant in respect of each of the charges and impose whatever lawful penalties he deems appropriate. No question was raised before us as to the propriety of this variation.\nThe charges against the appellant were as follows:\n(a) That the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, on the 26th day of June in the year 1961 at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, in the County of York, unlawfully did seek by threat of dismissal to compel certain of its employees, including Mrs. Laura Job, Mrs. Ann Todd, Robert Boyle, Albert Hetenyi, Raymond Seguin and Charles Ireton, to cease to exercise their right under The Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, to wit: The right of such employees, including the said Mrs. Laura Job, Mrs. Ann Todd, Robert Boyle, Albert Hetenyi, Raymond Seguin and Charles Ireton to participate in a lawful strike at the Royal York Hotel conducted by Local 299, Hotel and Club Employees\u2019 Union, AFL-CIO-CLC, of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees\u2019 and Bartenders\u2019 International Union, contrary to Section 50 (c) and 69 (1) of the said Labour Relations Act; and\n(b) That the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, on the 16th day of July in the year 1961 at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, in the County of York, unlawfully did refuse to continue to employ certain of its employees, including\u2026(the same six persons as named in charge (a))\u2026because they were exercising a right under The Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, to wit: The right\u2026(the right is described in the same words as in charge (a))\u2026, contrary to Sections 50 (a) and 69 (1) of the said Labour Relations Act.\nThe appeal before McRuer C.J.H.C. was brought on a case stated by the magistrate from which the facts appear to be as follows. The appellant is the operator of the Royal York Hotel in the City of Toronto. The respondent is an officer of the trade union described in the charges. This union, as the bargaining representative for a unit of employees in the hotel, had made a collective agreement with the appellant, which expired on August 16, 1960. Within two months before the agreement expired the union gave notice pursuant to s. 40(1) of the Act of its desire to bargain with a view to the renewal of the agreement with modifications. After the appellant and the union had bargained unsuccessfully conciliation services were granted. The union received the report of the conciliation board between March 6 and March 8, 1961. Further meetings were held but no settlement was reached. The prohibition against striking contained in section 54(2) of the Act therefore ceased to operate at the latest on March 15, 1961. On April 24, 1961, the union called a strike, which was still continuing at the time of the trial before the magistrate.\nOn June 26, 1961, the appellant sent to each of the six employees named in the charges a letter reciting that on the afternoon of April 24 the employee had withdrawn from the service of the hotel and had not reported for duty since that time, inviting him (or her) either to advise that he wished to return to work in the hotel or to resign, for which purpose appropriate forms were provided, and notifying him that, unless he returned one or other of the forms by July 15, he was \u201cdismissed effective July 16th, 1961\u201d.\nOn July 14 the respondent wrote to the appellant a letter saying in part:\nOur members wish to make clear that they consider themselves employees of the Royal York Hotel who are on a lawful strike and that they will continue to consider themselves to be employees of the Hotel until and after the strike is settled and a collective agreement between the Hotel and the Union is entered into.\nOn July 17, the appellant wrote a letter to the respondent and, on July 18, the appellant wrote a letter to each of the six persons named in the charges taking the position that the persons to whom the letter of June 26 had been addressed who had not advised that they wished to return to work were no longer employees of the hotel.\nOn September 29, 1961, the two charges were laid.\nAt the trial the learned magistrate found the facts set out above and also, that the persons referred to in the charges were at all relevant times members of the union, that the strike was \u201cunder the general supervision of the negotiating committee of the Union, the striking members, in addition to the executive of the Union\u201d, that Charles Ireton, as vice-president of the union, was in charge of assigning picketers, that meetings of members of the union who were striking employees were held daily, and, latterly, twice a week, in halls and premises rented and paid for by the union, and that throughout the strike the picketers had displayed signs bearing the name of the union and the words \u201cOn Strike\u2014Royal York Hotel\u201d. The grounds on which it was submitted that the learned magistrate erred in law in acquitting the appellant are set out in the stated case as follows:\n1. That I was wrong in law in holding that the right to strike is a common law right, and not a right under the Labour Relations Act, Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1960, Chapter 202.\n2. That I was wrong in law in holding that no strike could have properly been called nor could the employees in question cease to work unless or until they terminated their individual contracts by proper notice.\n3. That I was wrong in law in holding that the law required an employee to terminate his contract of employment for the purpose of participating in a strike.\n4. That in the alternative, I was wrong in law in holding that the Labour Relations Act, Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1960, Chapter 202, has not in the circumstances to which these informations relate altered the requirement that an employee shall terminate his individual contract of employment before participating in a strike.\n5. That I was wrong in law in holding that the persons referred to in the informations had no right to strike and to cease work as they did.\n6. That I was wrong in law in holding that the persons referred to in the informations ceased to be employees of the accused by going on strike and ceasing to work as they did, or that in any event they subjected themselves to being discharged in the manner in which they were by going on strike and ceasing to work as they did.\n7. That I was wrong in law in failing to hold that the strike in question in which the employees participated was a lawful activity of a trade union, namely, Local 299, Hotel and Club Employees\u2019 Union, AFL-CIO-CLC, of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees\u2019 and Bartenders\u2019 International Union.\nThe provisions of s. 50 of the Act under which the charges were laid are as follows:\n50. No employer, employers\u2019 organization or person acting on behalf of an employer or an employers\u2019 organization,\n(a) shall refuse to employ or to continue to employ a person, or discriminate against a person in regard to employment or any term or condition of employment because the person was or is a member of a trade union or was or is exercising any other rights under this Act;\n* * *\n(c) shall seek by threat of dismissal, or by any other kind of threat, or by the imposition of a pecuniary or other penalty, or by any other means to compel an employee to become or refrain from becoming or to continue to be or to cease to be a member or officer or representative of a trade union or to exercise any other rights under this Act. The learned Chief Justice of the High Court and the Court of Appeal have construed clause (c) of s. 50 as if the words \u201cto cease\u201d were inserted immediately before the concluding words \u201cto exercise any other rights under this Act\u201d. In answer to a question from the Court Mr. Jackett said that while not agreeing with this construction he did not intend to address any argument against it. Consequently Mr. Lewis was not called upon to deal with the point and, for the purposes of this appeal, I propose to assume that this construction is correct.\nIn considering the question whether the right to strike which the six persons named in the charges claimed to be exercising is a right under the Act, it must first be decided whether the strike was a lawful one. That the purpose of the employees in going on strike was not to injure their employer but to achieve improvements in their working conditions and monetary benefits has not been questioned. The argument that the strike was unlawful is based on the submission that in ceasing to work each of the employees was committing a breach of contract.\nThere is the highest authority for the proposition that a strike which would otherwise be lawful at common law becomes unlawful if the cessation of work is a breach of contract. It will be sufficient to refer briefly to the following cases.\nIn Denaby & Cadeby Main Collieries, Ltd. v. Yorkshire Miners\u2019 Association[3], it appears that the miners who went on strike were employed under contracts requiring them to give fourteen days\u2019 notice of termination. They went on strike without giving any notice. At p. 387 Lord Loreburn L.C. said:\nInasmuch as the men were all working under contracts which could not be terminated except after fourteen days\u2019 notice, it is manifest that the abrupt cessation of work on June 29 involved a breach of contract and was unlawful.\nAll the other learned Lords agreed in this view.\nIn South Wales Miners\u2019 Federation v. Glamorgan Coal Co.[4], the judgment is to the same effect. At p. 253, Lord Lindley said:\nTo break a contract is an unlawful act, or, in the language of Lord Watson in Allen v. Flood, \u201ca breach of contract is in itself a legal wrong\u201d. In Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co., Ltd. v.Veitch[5] the judgments emphasize the fact that the course of conduct of the defendants which was held not to be unlawful did not involve any breach of contract. Lord Wright said at p. 465:\nBut there might be circumstances which rendered the action wrongful. The men might be called out in breach of their contracts with their employer, and that would be clearly a wrongful act as against the employer, an interference with his contractual right, for which damages could be claimed not only as against the contract-breaker, but against the person who counselled or procured or advised the breach.\nI find nothing in the Act that renders lawful the calling of, or participation in, a strike where the cessation of work is in breach of a term in the contracts under which the employees are working requiring the giving of notice of a prescribed length before ceasing work; clear words in a statute would be required to bring about such an alteration in the law.\nIn the case at bar the record does not disclose the terms of the expired collective agreement or of the contracts under which the employees were working immediately before the commencement of the strike, nor does it show what notice, if any, was given by the union or by any of the employees of the time at which the employees would cease work. It, at first, occurred to me that the failure to have stated these facts might render it necessary to direct that the case be sent back to the learned magistrate for amendment pursuant to s. 740(1) (b) of the Criminal Code, but I have concluded that this is not necessary.\nMr. Jackett\u2019s real attack on the legality of the strike, if I have correctly apprehended his argument, is based not on the breach of a contractual provision requiring the employees to give a stated length of notice before ceasing work but rather on the view that, to remain within the law, each employee must before or at the moment of ceasing work terminate his contract of employment. It is said that so long as his contract is in existence it is his duty to work and failure to come to work is a breach of contract which renders the strike unlawful. In support of this submission reliance is placed on statements an example of which is that of Lord Davey in the Denaby case, supra, at p. 398:\nMy Lords, the appellants were perfectly within their right in electing to treat the absence of the men from work since June 29 as a rescission of their contracts and requiring them to enter into new contracts of service before resuming work.\nThat, undoubtedly, would be a correct statement of the position of the parties at common law; the employee cannot have it both ways; if he is still an employee it is his duty to work, and if he refuses to work he is in breach of the contract of employment and the employer can treat it as at an end. But, in my opinion, the position of the parties is altered by the relevant provisions of the Act.\nSubsection (2) of s. 1 of the Act is as follows:\n(2) For the purposes of this Act, no person shall be deemed to have ceased to be an employee by reason only of his ceasing to work for his employer as the result of a lock\u2011out or strike or by reason only of his being dismissed by his employer contrary to this Act or to a collective agreement.\nIt is not necessary to decide the exact nature of the relationship of employer and employee the existence of which this subsection preserves, or creates, during the continuance of a strike; two of the main features of the ordinary relationship are absent, the employee is not bound to work and the employer is not bound to pay wages. Whatever the relationship be, it is obvious that if the employer is entitled to terminate it on the sole ground that the employee refuses to work while the strike continues, the subsection is rendered nugatory.\nThe Act recognizes that strikes may be lawful or unlawful, (see e.g. s. 57); it forbids unlawful strikes, (see s. 55); it appears to me that it leaves it to be determined by the common law whether or not a strike is lawful; it forbids strikes which would otherwise be lawful at common law unless certain conditions have been complied with, (see particularly s. 54). In the case at bar those conditions had been fulfilled when the strike was called. The strike was, in my opinion, lawful at common law and not forbidden by the Act. That being so, it appears to me that the effect of s. 1(2) is (i) to provide that while the strike continues the employees on strike do not cease to be employees of the appellant, and (ii) to prevent the employer from terminating that employer-employee relationship by reason only of the employee ceasing to work as the result of the strike.\nIt is said that the Act does not in terms declare the right to strike, but I find myself in agreement with Mr. Lewis\u2019 argument that the right is conferred by s. 3 which reads:\n3. Every person is free to join a trade union of his own choice and to participate in its lawful activities.\nIt is clear on the findings of fact made by the learned magistrate that the strike with which we are concerned was an activity of the union; I have already expressed my opinion that it was lawful; it follows that s. 3 confers upon the six employees, all of whom are members of the union, the right to participate in that lawful activity. I conclude therefore that the participation in the strike by the employees was the exercise of a right under the Act.\nThe letter of June 26, 1961, sent by the appellant to each of the six employees named in the charges, is unambiguous; it threatens each of them with dismissal unless by July 15 he has either applied to return to work or resigned; it also indicates a refusal to continue to employ them after the last mentioned date. It may be that the two charges are really alternative ways of describing the same offence so that a conviction might be properly registered on either but not on both, but that point does not appear to have been raised at any stage of the proceedings. It will be observed that the letter proceeds on the assumption that the six persons to whom it was sent are still employees of the appellant and it gives only one reason for the proposed dismissal, that is that the employees have not reported for duty since April 24; it is not based on any alleged failure on the part of the employee to give a notice required by the terms of his contract of employment; this circumstance serves to confirm the view which I have already expressed that it is unnecessary to send the case back to the learned magistrate for amendment.\nFor the above reasons it is my opinion that on the facts as found by the learned magistrate he erred in law in acquitting the appellant. I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nLOCKE J.:\u2014The facts disclosed by the stated case do not include any information as to the terms of the contracts of employment existing between the railway company and the six persons whose rights, it is charged, were infringed, either as of the date of the expiration of the collective agreements on August 16, 1960, or at the time of the commencement of the strike on April 24, 1961.\nAs the collective agreement was not made part of the record and there is no other information disclosed, we are not in a position to decide whether, at the relevant time, the employees in question committed a breach of contract when, in company with other members of their union, they ceased work on April 24.\nIn view of the length of time which elapsed between the date of the delivery of the report of the conciliation board and the date the strike commenced and the fact that the parties conducted abortive negotiations during that period, it should not, in my opinion, be assumed that the employer was not informed by the union of the intention of all of the employees to quit their employment. If the six persons in question were employed by the day or simply at an hourly rate, such a notice given at a reasonable time before they quit work would, in my opinion, be effective to terminate such a contract of employment. If it was in law necessary that the contract be terminated before these employees quit their work, such notice might properly be given on their behalf by the union if duly authorized.\nIn the absence of any further evidence than is afforded by the stated case, we cannot properly, in my opinion, find that taking part in the strike involved a breach of the contracts of employment of these six individuals.\nI consider that the case should be decided upon the assumption that the strike of the members of the union, including these six persons, was lawful, as has been found by McRuer C.J.H.C., whose finding has been approved by the Court of Appeal.\nThe right which the complainants claim to have been infringed is their right to participate in a lawful strike and subs. (2) of s. 1 of The Labour Relations Act upon which they rely as defining their legal status must refer to such a strike. It would not, therefore, assist the respondents if their act of quitting work was unlawful. That subsection reads as follows:\nFor the purposes of this Act, no person shall be deemed to have ceased to be an employee by reason only of his ceasing to work for his employer as the result of a lock\u2011out or strike or by reason only of his being dismissed by his employer contrary to this Act or to a collective agreement.\nThis subsection does not, in my opinion, continue in force such employment contract as existed as of the date of a strike. It does no more than to declare that, for the purposes of the Act, the relationship of employer and employee continues despite the employee ceasing to work as the result of a strike. Accordingly, each of these six persons was an employee, within the meaning of that term in subs. (c) of s. 50, and entitled to the protection afforded by it.\nThe language of subsections (a) and (c) of s. 50 under which the two charges were laid, so far as it is relevant, reads:\nNo employer\n(a) shall refuse to employ or to continue to employ a person\u2026because the person was or is a member of a trade union or was or is exercising any other rights under this Act;\n* * *\n(c) shall seek by threat of dismissal, or by any other kind of threat\u2026to compel an employee to\u2026cease to be a member or officer or representative of a trade union or to exercise any other rights under this Act.\nThe letters written by the appellant on June 26, 1961, and July 18, 1961, have been construed, properly in my opinion, as a refusal to continue to employ these six persons from and after July 16, 1961, by reason of the fact that they continued on strike, and the letter of June 26, 1961, as a threat of dismissal if they continued such participation.\nI do not agree with the contention of the respondent that the right to strike is expressly given to employees by s. 3 of The Labour Relations Act. That section, saying that every person is free to join a trade union and to participate in its lawful activities, and s. 4 giving a similar right to persons to join an employer\u2019s organization, are equally meaningless. No statutory permission is necessary to participate in the lawful activities of any organization. Furthermore, it is not the union that strikes but the employees. The statute, however, implicitly recognizes that employees may lawfully strike by restricting that undoubted right during the currency of collective agreements, during the period in which conciliation proceedings are being carried on and for a defined period after an award. Section 57(2) refers in terms to a lawful strike. The objections to the legality of strikes on the ground that they are unlawful conspiracies or in restraint of trade which might formerly be made the subject of criminal charges have long since disappeared by reason of the provisions of the Criminal Code, and combinations of workmen for their own reasonable protection as such are expressly declared to be lawful by s. 411 of the Criminal Code and the predecessors of that section.\nWhile the right existed at common law at the time of the passing of The Labour Relations Act, that right was limited and controlled in the circumstances I have mentioned and it is expressly recognized after the expiration of these periods. Striking after complying with the requirements of the statute is, in my opinion, exercising a right under the Act within the meaning of that expression in s. 50.\nWhile unnecessary for the disposition of this appeal, I wish to express my dissent from the opinion that has been stated that if a strike is never concluded by settlement the relationship declared by subs. (2) of s. 1 continues until the employee has either gone back to work, taken employment with other employers, died or become unemployable. When employers have endeavoured to come to an agreement with their employees and followed the procedure specified by The Labour Relations Act, they are at complete liberty if a strike then takes place to engage others to fill the places of the strikers. At the termination of the strike, employers are not obliged to continue to employ their former employees if they have no work for them to do, due to their positions being filled. I can find no support anywhere for the view that the effect of the subsection is to continue the relationship of employer and employee indefinitely, unless it is terminated in one of the manner suggested.\nSubsection (2) of s. 1 appeared first in Ontario legislation in c. 34 of the Statutes of 1950. Legislation of this nature appeared at an earlier date in The Strikes and Lockouts Prevention Act of Manitoba, being c. 40 of the Statutes of 1937, and in the Wartime Labour Regulations prescribed by the Governor General in Council on February 17, 1944, which were adopted in Manitoba by c. 48 of the Statutes of 1944. Similar legislation was enacted thereafter in the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act of British Columbia and The Alberta Labour Act.\nThe idea of creating this artificial relationship appears to have originated in the National Labor Relations Act of the United States, commonly referred to as the Wagner Act, passed by Congress on July 5, 1935, s. 2 of which declared that the term \u201cemployee\u201d shall include any individual whose work had ceased as a result of a current labour dispute and who has not obtained any other regular and substantially equivalent employment.\nI do not construe the decision in Jeffery-DeWitt Insulator Co. v. National Labor Relations Board[6], and National Labor Relations Board v. Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co.[7], as deciding that in the United States the relationship continues indefinitely unless that relationship has been abandoned, as has been said.\nIn the first of these cases, the employer had refused to bargain with the union which represented its employees on the ground that by striking they had ceased to be such and Parker J. held that this was an unfair labour practice since the strike did not in itself terminate the relationship either at common law or under the Wagner Act.\nIn the second case decided in the Supreme Court, the employer, following the settlement of the strike, had refused to employ five men on account of union activities during the strike, and the finding that this was an unfair labour practice was upheld, reversing the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals. Roberts J., who delivered the judgment of the court, said, inter alia, that it did not follow that an employer guilty of no act forbidden by the statute had lost the right to protect and continue his business by supplying places left vacant by the strikers and was not bound to discharge those he had thus hired upon the election of the strikers to resume their employment in order to create places for them. That is the law in Canada also, in my opinion. I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nThe judgment of Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014The issue in the present appeal is a simple one. The collective agreement between the company and the union had expired. Every procedure required by the Act had been resorted to and every time limit had passed. The case is within s. 54(2), which reads:\n54. (2) Where no collective agreement is in operation, no employee shall strike and no employer shall lock out an employee until a trade union has become entitled to give and has given notice under section 11 or has given notice under section 40, on behalf of the employee to his employer, or in the case of a notice under section 40, has received such notice, and conciliation services have been granted and seven days have elapsed after the report of the conciliation board or the mediator has been released by the Minister to the parties or the Minister has informed the parties that he does not deem it advisable to appoint a conciliation board.\nThis subsection limits the right to strike until its requirements have been complied with. But once the statutory requirements have been complied with, the strike becomes lawful under the Act. The foundation of the right to strike is in the Act itself.\nWe are concerned in this appeal entirely with an alleged offence against this Act. Whether a common law cause of action exists against the union or the strikers makes no difference. Whatever the common law may say about strikes, this Act says that this strike is lawful because the statutory conditions have been complied with. That being so, the letter of June 26, 1961, constituted an offence under s. 50(c) of the Act and that of July 18, 1961, constituted an offence against s. 50(a). I therefore agree with Cartwright J. in his rejection of the appellant\u2019s argument that before there can be a lawful strike under the Act, the strikers must terminate their contracts of employment. Such a requirement would make nonsense of an Act which authorizes a certain course of conduct after certain things have been done and which, in addition, expressly preserves the employer-employee relationship by s. 1(2). I take this to be the ratio of the decision of Cartwright J. and I limit my agreement to that ratio. I put this limitation on my agreement because I have the greatest difficulty in understanding why South Wales Miners\u2019 Federation v. Glamorgan Coal Co.[8], and Denaby & Cadeby Main Collieries, Ltd. v. Yorkshire Miners\u2019 Association[9], entered into the argument of this appeal. In the first case, a union and its officers were found liable in damages for procuring breach of contracts of employment. In the second case, it was found that those who procured the strike in breach of contract were not authorized to act on behalf of the union with the result that there was no liability. There can be no dispute that breach of contract or inducing breach of contract gives a cause of action but these principles are not involved in this appeal and the extent to which these cases fit in with a Labour Relations Act or with collective agreements is better left untouched. When a collective agreement has expired, it is difficult to see how there can be anything left to govern the employer-employee relationship. Conversely, when there is a collective agreement in effect, it is difficult to see how there can be anything left outside, except possibly the act of hiring.\nMy conclusion in this case is that once it is made to appear that the statutory requirements have been complied with, a conviction as a result of these letters follows as a matter of course and that nothing else need be considered.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the defendant, appellant: G.P.

The respondent operated a garage and service station on highway no. 3 in the Province of Quebec. As a result of the construction of the , St. Lawrence Seaway, the highway was closed some 80 feet beyond the respondent's property and diverted a distance of some 1500 feet. The respondent's property was now located on a dead-end highway. No portion of his property was taken for the purposes of the seaway. By a petition of right the respondent claimed compensation for injurious affection. It was argued by the Crown that the injurious affection had not been caused by the construction of the seaway, but by the decision of the provincial Government to change the location of the highway and that there was therefore no claim in law against the Crown in the right of Canada. The trial judge maintained the petition of right and the Crown appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nIt was clearly established in evidence that the diversion of the highway was made at the request of the Seaway Authority and largely at its expense; it was also clear that had the seaway not been built, the location of the highway would not have been changed.\nIt seemed obvious that had the Seaway Authority or any other person, without statutory authorization, constructed a canal and blocked the main highway adjacent to the respondent's property the latter\u2014aside from any other remedies which might have been open to him\u2014 would have had a valid claim for damages under the general law. The statutory authority given to construct the works in question was however expressly made subject to the obligation to pay compensation for damage to lands injuriously affected. It seemed clear that there was a physical interference with a right which the owner was entitled to use in connection with his property, and that on the evidence such interference substantially diminished its value as a commercial property. The trial judge found that the construction of the canal and the diversion of the highway had adversely affected the respondent's land as a commercial property and there was ample evidence to support that finding. The amount awarded by the trial judge was not in issue in this appeal.\nAutographic Register Systems Limited v. C.N.R., [1933] Ex. C.R. 152; Metropolitan Board of Works v.

Appeal dismissed.\nP. M. Ollivier, and R. Tass\u00e9, for the appellant.\nFran\u00e7ois Dorval, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014The Crown has appealed from a judgment of the Exchequer Court2 awarding respondent an amount of $18,018.32 as indemnity for injurious affection caused to respondent's property as a result of the construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway by the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority, a statutory corporation, acting as agent for the Crown in the right of Canada.\nThe facts are not in dispute. Since 1949 respondent had been operating a garage and service station on the outskirts of Melocheville in the Province of Quebec. This garage was located on provincial highway no. 3, which is the main Montreal-Valley field highway running along the south shore of the St. Lawrence River. In 1957, by reason of the construction of the seaway, this highway was closed some 80 feet beyond respondent's property and diverted a distance of some 1500 feet to the east, passing under the seaway canal by means of a tunnel. As a result of the works constructed by the Seaway Authority and the diversion of the highway, respondent's property was thereafter located in a cul-de-sac at the very end of a street, some 80 to 90 feet from one of the canals and some 1500 feet from the intersection of the re-located highway. No portion of the property of respondent was taken for the purposes of the seaway and his claim is entirely one for injurious affection.\nCounsel for the Crown first argued that the injurious affection had not been caused by the construction of the seaway but by the decision of the provincial government to change the location of the highway and that there was therefore no claim in law against the Crown in the right of Canada. We were all of opinion at the hearing that this was not so and we did not hear the respondent on this point.\nIt was clearly established in evidence that the diversion of the highway was made at the request of the Seaway Authority and largely at its expense. It is also clear that had the seaway not been built the location of the highway would not have been changed. Decisions of the Quebec Courts in cases where damages have been claimed for injurious affection resulting from the closing or relocation of roads or streets under the Municipal Code or other relevant statutes are therefore of little assistance in the present case. Respondent's claim was made under s. 18(3) of the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority Act, Statutes of Canada 1951 (2nd session), 15-16 Geo. VI, c. 24, which reads:\n(3) The Authority shall pay compensation for lands taken or acquired under this section or for damage to lands injuriously affected by the construction of works erected by it and all claims against the Authority for such compensation may be heard and determined in the Exchequer Court of Canada in accordance with sections 46 to 49 of the Exchequer Court Act.\nThe conditions required to give rise to a claim for compensation for injurious affection to a property, when no land is taken, are now well established; Autographic Register Systems Ltd. v. Canadian National Railway Company3; Challies \"The Law of Expropriation\", p. 136. These conditions are:\n(1) the damage must result from an act rendered lawful by statutory powers of the person performing such act;\n(2) the damage must be such as would have been actionable under the commonlaw, but for the statutory powers;\n(3) the damage must be an injury to the land itself and not a personal injury or an injury to business or trade;\n(4) the damage must be occasioned by the construction of the public work, not by its user.\nMr. Ollivier for the Crown agreed that conditions 1 and 4 had been met in the present case but he argued that conditions 2 and 3 had not.\nAs to the second of the four conditions, it seems obvious that had the Seaway Authority or any other person, without statutory authorization constructed a canal and blocked the main highway adjacent to respondent's property, the latter\u2014aside from any other remedies which might have been open to him\u2014would have had a valid claim in damages under the general law. The learned trial judge so found and in my respectful opinion he was right in so doing. The statutory authority given to construct the works in question was however expressly made subject to the obligation to pay compensation for damage to lands injuriously affected. As to the third condition it seems clear to me that there was \"a physical interference with a right which the owner was entitled to use in connection with his property\"\u2014 Metropolitan Board of Works v. McCarthy4; C.P.R. v. Albin5;\u2014and that on the evidence such interference substantially diminished its value as a commercial property.\nRespondent carried on a general garage and service station business selling oil, gasoline and the like, and prior to the construction of the canal the property was well located for that purpose. The learned trial judge found that the construction of the canal and the diversion of the highway had adversely affected respondent's land as a commercial property and there is ample evidence to support that finding. He fixed the damages at $18,018.32. This amount included a sum of $5,280.90 for depreciation of respondent's residence on the basis that the garage building and residence were interdependent. Under ordinary circumstances, it would seem unlikely that the construction of the canal and the diversion of the highway would diminish the value of land for residential purposes. However we do not have to consider that aspect of the matter here, since counsel for appellant made no special point of the house and at the conclusion of the argument stated that in the event of the Crown being found liable the amount awarded was not now in issue.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.

The collision occurred in very severe winter weather and in thick intermittent fog. The ice-breaker had gone to the assistance of the ferry which had become caught in ice floes. The Crown alleged that the collision was caused by the fault and negligence of the Cit\u00e9 de Levis. The defence contended that the collision was an inevitable accident or was due to the negligence of the navigators of the Lady Grey. The trial judge found that the collision was not due to an inevitable accident but was caused by the negligent operation of both vessels, and apportioned the liability of the defendant at 60 per cent and of the plaintiff at 40 per cent. The trial judge also held that the defendant was entitled to limit its liability under the Canada Shipping Act. The Crown appealed to this Court and the defendant cross-appealed.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed.\nThe trial judge was justified in finding that the collision was not an inevitable accident, that it was not due solely to the fault and negligence of the navigators of the Lady Grey, and that the ferry had no look-out and had failed to sound the signals required by r. 15(c)(1) of the Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea.\nHowever, although the defendant was entitled, as held by the trial judge, to limit its liability at $40,390, the trial judge had erred in taking 60 per cent. of that amount and giving judgment for $24,234. The trial judge had also erred in allowing interest only at the rate of 4 per cent. instead of at the rate of 5 per cent. as provided for by s. 3 of the Interest Act, R.S.C. 1952, c 156.\nAPPEAL and cross-appeal from a judgment of Fournier J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1. Appeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed.\nR. C. Holden, Q.C., and R. Tass\u00e9, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nJ. Brisset, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by The Chief Justice:\u2014This is an appeal by Her Majesty the Queen and a cross-appeal by Levis Ferry Limited from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada2 in which the appellant was plaintiff and the cross-appellant was defendant. The proceedings were commenced by information and were not brought in Admiralty, although the Court and counsel proceeded as if they were.\nThe appellant was the owner of the Ship Lady Grey, a twin screw ice-breaker, and the respondent was the owner of the steam ferry Cit\u00e9 de Levis. On February 1, 1955, at the request of the respondent, the Lady Grey went to the assistance of the ferry which had become caught in ice floes and was unable to reach her berth at Quebec. Ultimately the ship and the ferry collided as a result of which the ship sank and was a total loss, for which the information claimed damages. There is no dispute as to the total amount of damages sustained, $310,775, and the appellant does not now question the trial judge's apportionment of liability, i.e., 60 per cent. to the respondent and 40 per cent. to the appellant. The respondent, however, claims that the collision was an inevitable accident and that it should not be held liable for any amount or in any event for a less percentage than that found by the trial judge.\nIt will be convenient to deal first with the cross-appeal. On the argument questions were raised as to the correctness of some of the facts found by the trial judge. While there may be discrepancies in his reasons, on the whole there was no serious error and he came to the right conclusion as to the fault and liability for the collision. He had the assistance of two assessors and no objection was taken either to the forum or to the presence and use of these assessors. We agree with him that the collision was not an inevitable accident and that the collision was not due solely to the fault and negligence of those in charge of the navigation of the Lady Grey. The ferry had no lookout at the time of the collision and failed to sound the signals required by r. 15(c)(1) of the Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. Indeed we are inclined to agree with the submission of counsel for the cross-respondent that the trial judge placed insufficient emphasis on the speed at which the ferry was manoeuvring just before the collision, but in any event the main ground upon which he proceeded as to the fault of those in charge of the navigation of the ferry is justified upon the evidence. The only other point raised by the cross-appeal was that in view of the result at which the trial judge arrived he should have given the appellant only part of the costs of the action but we see no reason to interfere with that disposition. The cross-appeal is, therefore, dismissed with costs.\nThe first branch of the appeal is really not disputed. The appellant agrees that the respondent was entitled to limit its liability at $40,390, but the cross-appellant also agrees that the trial judge was in error in taking 60 per cent. of that figure and giving judgment only for $24,234. The second point in the appeal is that the trial judge was in error in allowing interest only at 4 per cent. instead of 5 per cent. Apparently the trial judge followed a rule in England, but in Canada the point is covered by s. 3 of the Interest Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 156. It is emphasized that counsel for the respondent admitted that interest should be allowed, but he contended that the trial judge was correct in fixing the rate at 4 per cent.\nThe appeal is therefore allowed with costs, the cross-appeal dismissed with costs and the judgment of the Exchequer Court set aside. Judgment is directed to be entered for the appellant against the respondent in the sum of $40,390 with interest at 5 per cent. per annum from February 1, 1955, to the date of payment. The appellant is entitled to her costs of the action.\nAppeal allowed with costs;\nCross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: E. A.

The defendant knew that the air vents of the storage tanks were in a defective condition. After inserting the hose into one of the storage tanks, he left the vicinity to go inside the service station office from which he could not supervise the filling operations. A quantity of gasoline spilled over, flowed into the service station and came into contact with a heating stove which was in operation at the time. A fire broke out and the service station and all its contents were destroyed. The plaintiff had complained previously to British American Oil Limited, the owners of the pumps and storage tanks, about their defective conditions. The plaintiff instituted an action against L and British American Oil Ltd., but proceeded only against L. The trial judge maintained the action. This judgment was affirmed by a majority in the Court of Queen's Bench where the two dissenting judges found contributory negligence. The defendant L appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe defendant L was negligent in not watching over the filling operations when he knew that the air vents were not operating properly. If he had stayed at the scene he could have stopped the flow of gasoline and prevented the fire. There was no contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. Contributory negligence can only exist where both parties, the plaintiff and the defendant, are each guilty of negligence so connected with the injury as to be a cause materially contributing to it. If the negligence of either party falls short of this it is an irrelevant matter. In the present case, the fact that the plaintiff permitted the defendant to fill the storage tank although he knew that the air vents were defective, was not the effective cause of the accident.

Il all\u00e8gue en outre qu'il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire des b\u00e2tisses et du terrain, mais que les pompes \u00e0 essence \u00e9taient la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, et \u00e9taient sous la garde et entretenues par la British American Oil Co. Ltd. Quant \u00e0 Georges Emile Larocque, il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de camions et faisait la distribution de la gazoline des r\u00e9servoirs de la British American Oil Co. Ltd. aux r\u00e9servoirs situ\u00e9s pr\u00e8s du garage du demandeur et sur sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nLe 21 octobre, le d\u00e9fendeur Larocque fit une livraison de gazoline au demandeur, et le d\u00e9chargement de la gazoline du camion se faisait par l'entremise de boyaux qui \u00e9taient reli\u00e9s aux r\u00e9servoirs situ\u00e9s sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur. Au cours de la livraison de la gazoline, celle-ci en grande quantit\u00e9 se r\u00e9pandit autour des r\u00e9servoirs, p\u00e9n\u00e9tra dans le garage, et un incendie \u00e9clata qui consuma le garage et de la marchandise.\nLe demandeur institua contre le d\u00e9fendeur Larocque et contre la British American Oil Co. Ltd une action au montant de $22,576.83. M. le Juge Mitchell de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Sherbrooke, maintint l'action pour $20,796.83, et la Cour d'Appel1 confirma ce jugement. MM. les Juges Bissonnette et Andr\u00e9 Taschereau, dissidents, auraient partag\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 entre le d\u00e9fendeur Larocque et le demandeur C\u00f4t\u00e9. Pour une raison que je ne connais pas, le demandeur n'a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate que contre le d\u00e9fendeur Larocque et n'a pas inscrit contre la British American Oil Co. Ltd., l'autre d\u00e9fenderesse.\nSur le terrain de l'intim\u00e9, en avant de son garage, il se trouvait trois pompes qui servent \u00e0 la livraison de la gazoline aux clients. Elles sont reli\u00e9es aux r\u00e9servoirs enfonc\u00e9s sous le sol, qui peuvent contenir plusieurs centaines de gallons de gazoline. A cette date du 21 octobre 1958, Larocque qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 requis par C\u00f4t\u00e9 de livrer environ 700 gallons, commen\u00e7a \u00e0 remplir le r\u00e9servoir du centre. Ces r\u00e9servoirs sont \u00e9quip\u00e9s d'\u00e9vent-d'air afin de permettre \u00e0 l'air de sortir \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur \u00e0 mesure que p\u00e9n\u00e8tre la gazoline. Or, il ne fait pas de doute que l'\u00e9vent-d'air de la pompe du centre ne fonctionnait pas. A l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 du boyau dont se servait Larocque pour d\u00e9verser la gazoline dans les r\u00e9servoirs, se trouvait un ajutage destin\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9gulariser et \u00e0 interrompre de flot de la gazoline. Il suffit \u00e0 l'op\u00e9rateur de presser ou de rel\u00e2cher une manette qui contr\u00f4le l'entr\u00e9e de la gazoline dans les r\u00e9servoirs.\nLe juge au proc\u00e8s a trouv\u00e9 que le d\u00e9fendeur appelant Larocque a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gligent en laissant l'ajutage dans l'orifice par o\u00f9 p\u00e9n\u00e8tre la gazoline, et en s'\u00e9loignant sans surveiller si tout fonctionnait normalement. L'appelant aurait d\u00fb rester pr\u00e8s des r\u00e9servoirs, afin d'interrompre le flot de gazoline s'il se produisait un d\u00e9bordement. C'est aussi la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle est arriv\u00e9e la Cour du banc de la reine. Je partage ces vues, et je crois que l'appelant, qui avait le contr\u00f4le de la livraison de la gazoline, a fait preuve de n\u00e9gligence. S'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus attentif, plus alerte dans l'exercise de ses fonctions, et s'il s'\u00e9tait tenu pr\u00e8s de l'ajutage pour interrompre l'entr\u00e9e de la gazoline, il n'y a pas de doute que ce sinistre ne se serait pas produit.\nD'ailleurs, Larocque savait que les trois \u00e9vents-d'air ne fonctionnaient pas normalement. D\u00e9j\u00e0, il avait constat\u00e9 que la pompe de droite no. 1 \u00e9tait d\u00e9fectueuse, car quelques mois avant l'accident qui nous occupe, alors qu'il remplissait le r\u00e9servoir, la gazoline avait jailli dans son visage et celui du p\u00e8re de l'intim\u00e9, et s'\u00e9tait r\u00e9pandue sur le sol avec profusion. L'appelant Larocque savait \u00e9galement que les trois pompes \u00e9taient d\u00e9fectueuses. En effect, l'intim\u00e9 jure positivement qu'il s'est plaint plusieurs fois de l'\u00e9tat des pompes, et qu'il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Larocque de faire des repr\u00e9sentations dans ce sens \u00e0 la B.A. Oil. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, ce dernier ne nie pas les affirmations de C\u00f4t\u00e9. En outre, C\u00f4t\u00e9 jure que la gazoline a jailli \u00e0 maintes reprises lors de livraisons ant\u00e9rieures, et Larocque se contente de dire qu'il ne s'en souvient pas. La Cour du banc de la reine a eu raison de conclure que Larocque connaissait les d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9s des trois \u00e9vent-d'air; et le fait que Larocque dit que la gazoline n'a jailli ant\u00e9rieurement du r\u00e9servoir qu'une fois seulement, ne signifie' nullement qu'il ignorait les d\u00e9fauts des deux autres r\u00e9servoirs. La preuve d\u00e9montre le contraire.\nDans ces conditions, je crois que Larocque ne peut \u00eatre excus\u00e9. Quand, vers midi, le 1\" octobre 1958, il est arriv\u00e9 au garage faire sa livraison, l'intim\u00e9 et ses deux employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient \u00e0 l'autre extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 du garage, occup\u00e9s \u00e0 travailler. Sans leur dire quoi que ce soit, Larocque mit le moteur en mouvement, fixa l'ajutage \u00e0 la pompe du centre, et p\u00e9n\u00e9tra dans le bureau de la comptabilit\u00e9 d'o\u00f9 il ne pouvoit voir les pompes, et d'o\u00f9 il lui \u00e9tait impossible de surveiller les op\u00e9rations. Aussi, quand la gazoline a d\u00e9bord\u00e9, il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible d'arriver \u00e0 temps pour fermer l'ajutage et emp\u00eacher environ vingt-cinq gallons de gazoline de se r\u00e9pandre sur le sol, de se diriger vers le garage et de venir en contact avec un po\u00e8le chauff\u00e9 situ\u00e9 au centre de l'unique pi\u00e8ce de 50 x 56 pieds. C'est sa connaissance des d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9s des pompes et son d\u00e9faut de surveillance, son \u00e9loignement des r\u00e9servoirs l'emp\u00eachant ainsi de fermer l'ajutage, qui sont les causes d\u00e9terminantes de cet accident.\nL'appelant soutient qu'il ne doit pas supporter seul toute la responsabilit\u00e9, et qu'il y a au moins faute contributive, parce que l'intim\u00e9 l'aurait laiss\u00e9 emplir les r\u00e9servoirs, et que son attitude passive constitue une faute. Pour qu'il y ait faute contributive, il faut qu'il y ait deux fautes, celle de la victime et celle de l'auteur du dommage, qui concourent \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation du pr\u00e9judice. En outre, il ne suffit pas qu'il y ait faute, mais il faut un rapport de causalit\u00e9 entre cette faute et le pr\u00e9judice. Comme l'a dit le Comit\u00e9 Judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans Fr\u00e9chette v. C.P.R.2:\nBy the law which prevails in the Province of Quebec in actions for negligence where both parties have been in fault damages are awarded proportionate to the degree in which the respective parties are to blame; where, however, the sole effective cause of an accident is the plaintiff's own negligence he is not entitled to recover any damages. Une cause identique Great Eastern Oil and Import Co. Ltd. v. Best Motor Accessories Co. Ltd.3 est venue devant cette Cour. Dans cette cause, le Juge en chef Kerwin, parlant au nom de tous les membres de la Cour, s'est exprim\u00e9 de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nIt was held by this Court in McLaughlin v. Long, ...............................that to constitute contributory negligence it does not suffice that there be some fault on the part of a plaintiff without which the damage would not have been suffered and that the negligence charged must be proximate in the sense of an effective cause of the damages.\nEn r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le droit commun anglais ne reconnait pas la faute contributive, dans le sens d'un partage de responsabilit\u00e9, mais les provinces ont adopt\u00e9 des l\u00e9gislations sp\u00e9ciales, qui permettent aux juges de diviser la responsabilit\u00e9. C'est ce qui est arriv\u00e9 dans la cause ci-dessus, qui venait de Terre-Neuve, et les principes applicables sont pratiquement les m\u00eames que ceux qui existent dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nR\u00e9cemment, dans une cause de \u00c9difice Continental Inc. v. W. H. Adam Limit\u00e9e4, la Cour du banc de la reine a eu \u00e0 juger une cause o\u00f9 les m\u00eames principes s'appliquaient. La Cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ce qui suit:\nA fuel oil dealer delivering oil is not responsible for damages resulting from sudden back flow and ejection of oil from the intake pipe of the receiving tank caused by blocking of the air vent. The tank was under the care of the building superintendent who had ordered the oil. The dealer had no reason to suspect that the tank was in a defective condition.\nDans cette cause, l'action a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e car, comme on le voit, le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 qui versait l'huile ne savait pas et n'avait pas de raison de savoir que les r\u00e9servoirs \u00e9taient en mauvais ordre. Dans la cause qui nous occupe, c'est le contraire qui existe. L'appelant savait que les r\u00e9servoirs \u00e9taient d\u00e9fectueux et n'a exerc\u00e9 aucune surveillance pour pr\u00e9venir ce qu'il savait \u00eatre de nature \u00e0 se produire. C'est la faute de l'appelant qui est la causa causans de l'accident, le lien de causalit\u00e9 entre l'activit\u00e9 de Larocque et le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9.\nJe suis donc d'opinion qu'ayant charge de la livraison de la gazoline, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les conditions qui existaient et qui lui \u00e9taient bien connues, l'appelant devait entourer ses actes d'une tr\u00e8s grande prudence, beaucoup plus grande que celle qu'il a d\u00e9montr\u00e9e, et qu'il doit porter seul la responsabilit\u00e9 de cet accident. Quant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, je ne crois pas que l'on puisse lui imputer une partie de la responsabilit\u00e9. Sa passivit\u00e9 n'entre pas dans la causalit\u00e9 du dommage.\nDans l'arr\u00eat de Fr\u00e9chette v. C.P.R., supra, p. 879, le Comit\u00e9 Judiciaire du Conseil Priv\u00e9 a bien \u00e9tabli le principe que la faute, contributive ne peut exister que dans le cas \"\u2026 where both parties, plaintiff and defendant, are each guilty of negligence so connected with the injury as to be a cause materially contributing to it. If the negligence of either party falls short of this it is an irrelevant matter, an incuria, no doubt, but to use Lord Cairn's words, not an incuria dans locum injuriae\".\nJe suis donc d'opinion que l'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the defendant, appellant: Birtz, Pouliot, Mercure & Lebel, Montreal.\nAttorney for the plaintiff, respondent: E.

He claimed a loss of $25,643.40 from the defendant insurance company under a policy containing a clause requiring the assured to keep a detailed and itemized inventory. The trial judge concluded that such an inventory had been kept and maintained the action. The Court of Queen's Bench, by a majority judgment, reversed in part this finding of the trial judge and maintained the action for a sum of $11,144.82. The plaintiff appealed to this Court and the defendant cross-appealed.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed.\nA clause, such as the one in question here, should be interpreted reasonably, in accordance with common sense and having in mind the type of business insured. So long as the books, taken as a whole and properly kept, allow the determination of the value of the merchandise the condition is fulfilled. In the present case, the plaintiff has established his loss and has fulfilled the conditions of the clause respecting the inventory.\nAPPEAL and cross-appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing in part a judgment of Demers J. Appeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed.\nJ. M. Charbonneau, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nL. P. de Grandpr\u00e9, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014L'appelant est de son m\u00e9tier horloger-bijoutier, et exer\u00e7ait son commerce au temps o\u00f9 se sont produits les faits qui ont donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 ce litige, au num\u00e9ro 623 Notre-Dame Ouest, Montr\u00e9al. La compagnie intim\u00e9e a \u00e9mis, le 9 d\u00e9cembre 1954, une police d'assurance qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9e en 1955 pour une p\u00e9riode additionnelle d'une ann\u00e9e.\nA la date du renouvellement, cette police qui couvrait les pertes contre le vol et le vol avec effraction, a \u00e9t\u00e9 augment\u00e9e du montant original \u00e0 $30,000 sur la marchandise, et \u00e0 $500 sur l'argent et les valeurs plac\u00e9s dans le coffre-fort dans le magasin de l'assur\u00e9.\nLe demandeur all\u00e8gue dans son action que le 26 d\u00e9cembre 1955, des voleurs sont entr\u00e9s dans son magasin et se sont empar\u00e9s de marchandises et d'argent, propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'assur\u00e9, pour une valeur de $25,643.40. La force constabulaire de Montr\u00e9al a \u00e9t\u00e9 imm\u00e9diatement notifi\u00e9e, mais il n'appara\u00eet pas que les bandits ni la marchandise vol\u00e9e aient \u00e9t\u00e9 localis\u00e9s. L'appelant a imm\u00e9diatement produit sa r\u00e9clamation pour le montant ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9, mais la compagnie a toujours refus\u00e9 de payer. Le 13 septembre 1956, par l'interm\u00e9diaire de ses procureurs, l'appelant a en cons\u00e9quence institu\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures l\u00e9gales pour r\u00e9clamer cette somme de $25,643.40, et son action a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue par M. le Juge Demers de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, si\u00e9geant \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, pour le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9. La Cour du banc de la reine2 a maintenu en partie l'appel1; de la compagnie d'assurance, a condamn\u00e9 cette compagnie \u00e0 payer au pr\u00e9sent appelant la somme de $11,144.82. M. le Juge Taschereau, dissident, aurait rejet\u00e9 l'action en totalit\u00e9, et M. Le Juge Owen, dissident, aurait confirm\u00e9 le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance.\nDevant cette Cour, l'assur\u00e9 appelle du jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine afin de faire r\u00e9tablir celui de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, et la compagnie d'assurance, par contre-appel, demande que l'action soit rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nLa d\u00e9termination de cette cause repose sur l'interpr\u00e9tation de la clause 10 de la police, qui est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e dans les termes suivants:\n10.\u2014Warranted that the Assured keeps a detailed and itemized inventory of all property including traveling salesmen's stocks, in such manner that the exact amount of loss can be accurately determined therefrom by the Company.\nLe savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance a conclu que le demandeur-appelant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 la victime d'un vol avec effraction, qu'il tenait des livres permettant d'\u00e9tablir avec certitude le montant de la perte, et qu'il s'est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les obligation qu'il avait assum\u00e9es par les termes de la police d'assurance. Au contraire, trois des Juges de la Cour du banc de la reine, les Juges Casey, Larouche (ad hoc) et Choquette, ont enlev\u00e9 du jugement rendu l'item \"assorted jewellery $7,994.55\" et l'item de $11,265.00 pour les achats appel\u00e9s \"achats de rue\". Ils ont conclu que quant \u00e0 ces deux item, la comptabilit\u00e9 tenue par l'appelant ne r\u00e9pondait pas aux exigences de la clause 10, en ce sens qu'on n'y trouvait pas un inventaire \"detailed and itemized\" permettant de d\u00e9terminer le montant exact des pertes subies par l'assur\u00e9. Quant \u00e0 M. le Juge Taschereauu, il voit dans la clause 10 de la police une garantie que l'appelant tiendrait un inventaire de tous les biens assur\u00e9s. Comme il aurait failli de le faire, la police doit \u00eatre annul\u00e9e, et tout recours doit \u00eatre interdit au demandeur-appelant. Une grande partie de la preuve a consist\u00e9 dans les t\u00e9moignages d'experts comptables, qui ont eu \u00e0 appr\u00e9cier les inventaires ainsi que les livres de l'appelant.\nLe demandeur-appelant a fait entendre deux t\u00e9moins experts, les comptables agr\u00e9\u00e9s L. Shatsky et G. Millman. Apr\u00e8s leur \u00e9tude de tous les livres, ces deux t\u00e9moins ont trouv\u00e9 que la comptabilit\u00e9 du demandeur est classifi\u00e9e sous le nom de doubles entr\u00e9es, et que l'inventaire tenu par le demandeur peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme d\u00e9taill\u00e9. Ces t\u00e9moins sont d'avis que la tenue de livres, les entr\u00e9es et dossiers du demandeur sont m\u00eame plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9s que ceux que l'on trouve habituellement dans des commerces \u00e9quivalant \u00e0 celui du demandeur, qu'ils sont plus complets que ceux de commerces plus importants, et qu'ils permettent d'\u00e9tablir avec certitude la perte subie. Le t\u00e9moin Salvas, comptable, entendu par l'intim\u00e9e, a trouv\u00e9 les inventaires insuffisants et est d'opinion qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas possible, avec les documents qu'il a examin\u00e9s, de d\u00e9terminer la perte r\u00e9sultant du vol.\nDevant ce conflit d'opinions, l'honorable Juge Demers a nomm\u00e9 un expert ind\u00e9pendant, M. Romain B\u00e9dard comptable agr\u00e9\u00e9, dont le t\u00e9moignage n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 comme une \u00abexpertise\u00bb parce que le t\u00e9moin n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 asserment\u00e9 au pr\u00e9alable. Son t\u00e9moignage a cependant \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u de consentement et son rapport a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au dossier, et fait partie de la preuve au proc\u00e8s.\nDans une lettre produite comme exhibit, adress\u00e9e \u00e0 M. le Juge Andr\u00e9 Demers, M. B\u00e9dard affirme qu'il en est venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il est possible, dans son opinion, d'\u00e9tablir avec exactitude la perte subie par le demandeur \u00e0 la suite du vol dont il est question. Pour lui, la d\u00e9termination d'une perte d'inventaire \u00e0 la suite d'un vol ou d'un incendie constitue un probl\u00e8me comptable. Ce probl\u00e8me peut se r\u00e9soudre par l'application de certains principes comptables, et c'est l'application de ces principes qui lui a permis de d\u00e9terminer avec exactitude la perte subie. Tous ces principes, de m\u00eame que les d\u00e9tails de ses calculs, sont indiqu\u00e9s dans le rapport qu'il a fait le 8 janvier 1959, et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au dossier. Son rapport et son t\u00e9moignage r\u00e9v\u00e8lent que la perte subie s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 $28,653.92. M. B\u00e9dard s'est servi de l'ensemble des livres pour \u00e9tablir la valeur des marchandises en mains; on peut s\u00fbrement chercher dans ces livres ce qu'il faut pour compl\u00e9ter \"l'inventaire\", et \u00e9tablir gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 eux la perte en cas de vol. Le juge au proc\u00e8s a accept\u00e9 ce rapport de M. B\u00e9dard dont les conclusions sont presque identiques \u00e0 celles de Shatsky et Millman. En effet, tous trois sont d'avis que la comptabilit\u00e9 de l'appelant est suffisante pour permettre d'\u00e9tablir l'inventaire des marchandises en mains au moment de la perte.\nUne clause comme la clause 10 doit \u00eatre raisonnablement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e, conform\u00e9ment au sens commun et en tenant compte du genre d'affaires qui \u00e9taient assur\u00e9es. On a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l'enqu\u00eate que l'appelant aurait d\u00fb tenir un inventaire perp\u00e9tuel. Je ne crois pas que cette proposition puisse \u00eatre s\u00e9rieusement entretenue, \u00e0 la lecture de la clause 10 qui n'exige m\u00eame pas que l'inventaire qui doit \u00eatre fait soit un inventaire annuel. Du moment que la totalit\u00e9 des livres convenablement tenus par l'appelant permet de d\u00e9terminer la valeur de la marchandise, je crois que la condition est remplie. C'est d'ailleurs ce qu'ont trouv\u00e9 les trois experts Shatsky, Millman et B\u00e9dard.\nComme j'en viens \u00e0 la conclusion que l'appelant a \u00e9tabli sa perte et qu'il a satisfait aux conditions de la clause 10, il devient inutile de d\u00e9terminer la proposition de M. le Juge Taschereau qui aurait rejet\u00e9 l'action in toto, parce qu'une partie de l'inventaire n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9taill\u00e9e.\nJe suis d'opinion que l'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu, le jugement du juge au proc\u00e8s r\u00e9tabli avec d\u00e9pens \u00e0 la Cour du banc de la reine et devant cette Cour, et que le contre-appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 \u00e9galement avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal allowed and Cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, appellant: Roy, Charbonneau and Geoffrion, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: Tansey, de Grandpr\u00e9, de Grandpr\u00e9, Bergeron and Monet, Montreal.\n1 [1962] Que.

James Copithorne (Defendants) Defendants.\n1962: June 13, 14, 15; 1962: June 25.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland andRitchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nCrown\u2014Receiver appointed of certain property\u2014Crown's interest therein dependent on validity of lagislation which it had itself passed\u2014Validity of legislation open to doubt\u2014Crown not immune from receivership order\u2014Jurisdiction of Court to preserve assets whose title is dependent on impugned legislation.\nReceiver\u2014Limitation in certain respects of receiver's authority immaterial.\nPending the trial of an action brought by the plaintiff corporation against the defendant company, an order was made by McInnes J. appointing one P a receiver of the undertaking, property and interests in the defendant company. An appeal from this order by the defendant company and the Attorney-General of British Columbia was allowed by a majority of the Court of Appeal. Pursuant to leave granted by this Court, the plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nQuestions arose in the action as to the constitutionality of the Power Development Act, 1961, 1961 (B.C.), 2nd sess., c. 4, the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority Act, 1962 (B.C.), c. 8, and An Act to Amend the Power Development Act, 1961, 1962 (B.C.), c. 50. At the time of the present appeal these points were before the Supreme Court of British Columbia on the trial of the action. The decision on the point as to the constitutional validity of these statutes automatically would determine whether the Crown had any title to the common shares of the defendant company, and whether the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority had any right, title or interest, in or to the assets of that company. It was contended that the Court had no jurisdiction to make a receivership order in order that the assets might be preserved pending the determination of those issues because, it was said, such an order cannot be made which would affect the property or interests of the Crown. Held (Abbott J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the chamber judge restored with certain amendments.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: In a federal system, where legislative authority is divided, as are also the prerogatives of the Crown, it is not open to the Crown, either in right of Canada or of a Province, to claim a Crown immunity based upon an interest in certain property, where its very interest in that property depends completely and solely on the validity of the legislation which it has itself passed, if there is a reasonable doubt as to whether such legislation is constitutionally valid. In a federal system, in such circumstances, the Court has the same jurisdiction to preserve assets whose title is dependent on the validity of the legislation as it has to determine the validity of the legislation itself.\nThe objection that in view of the terms of the order P was not really a receiver failed. A receiver when appointed, is subject to the orders of the Court and the mere fact that his authority was limited could make no difference.\nPer Abbott J., dissenting: For the reasons given by Davey J.A. in the Court below, the chamber judge was without jurisdiction to make the receivership order.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] allowing an appeal from a receivership order made by McInnes J. Appeal allowed, Abbott J. dissenting.\nJ. J. Robinette, Q.C., and D. M. Goldie, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nHon. R. L. Kellock, Q.C., and C. W. Brazier, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent: British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority.\nM. M. McFarlane, Q.C., and W. G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the defendant, respondent: Attorney-General of British Columbia.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau, Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiff in this action, British Columbia Power Corporation, Limited, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] dated April 19, 1962, allowing the appeal of the defendants, British Columbia Electric Company Limited, and the Attorney-General of British Columbia, from the order of McInnes J., dated March 22, 1962, appointing Henry Leslie Purdy a receiver of the undertaking, property and interests of the defendant, British Columbia Electric Company Limited, pending the trial of the action and until further order. Norris J.A. and Tysoe J.A. dissented.\nOn May 14, 1962, a motion made that day to this Court for leave to appeal was granted, whereupon counsel for the plaintiff immediately applied to the Court to hear the appeal at the present sittings. No objection was raised to this request and it was so ordered.\nQuestions arise in the action as to the constitutionality of the Power Development Act, 1961 of British Columbia, 1961 (B.C.), 2nd sess., c. 4, the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority Act, 1962 (B.C.), c. 8, and An Act to Amend the Power Development Act, 1961, 1962 (B.C.), c. 50. All these points are now before the Supreme Court of British Columbia on the trial of the action. Quite properly no extensive argument thereon was presented to us by counsel for any of the parties represented before us, but sufficient has been shown to indicate that substantial questions arise.\nIt is conceded by counsel for the Attorney-General of British Columbia that the Courts have the jurisdiction to determine the constitutional validity of each of the three statutes under attack in the present proceedings. In determining that issue, the Court automatically determines whether the Crown has any title to the common shares in British Columbia Electric Company Limited, and whether the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority has any right, title or interest in or to the assets of that company. Counsel contends, however, that the Court has no jurisdiction to make a receivership order in order that the assets may be preserved pending the determination of those issues because, it is said, such an order cannot be made which would affect the property or interests of the Crown. In a federal system, where legislative authority is divided, as are also the prerogatives of the Crown, as between the Dominion and the Provinces, it is my view that it is not open to the Crown, either in right of Canada or of a Province, to claim a Crown immunity based upon an interest in certain property, where its very interest in that property depends completely and solely on the validity of the legislation which it has itself passed, if there is a reasonable doubt as to whether such legislation is constitutionally valid. To permit it to do so would be to enable it, by the assertion of rights claimed under legislation which is beyond its powers, to achieve the same results as if the legislation were valid. In a federal system it appears to me that, in such circumstances, the Court has the same jurisdiction to preserve assets whose title is dependent on the validity of the legislation as it has to determine the validity of the legislation itself.\nI can find no substance in the objection raised on behalf of the respondents that, in view of the terms of the order made by McInnes J., Mr. Purdy is not really a receiver. A receiver, when appointed, is subject to the orders of the Court and the mere fact that his authority was limited in certain respects can make no difference.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the order of McInnes J. restored with the following amendments. The second clause of the operative part of the order directs that Mr. Purdy furnish a bond, etc., \"within seven days of the entry of this Order\". This should be changed to read \"on or before July 3rd, 1962\". The following words in the third operative clause \"or constitute a default in the provisions of any Trust Deed\" should be deleted in accordance with the submission of counsel for the appellant. The Royal Trust Company was an appellant before the Court of Appeal and was there represented by counsel who asked that the quoted words be deleted. The Royal Trust Company was not represented before us, but in a letter to the Registrar its counsel also asked that these words be omitted. The order of McInnes J. that the costs of the motion before him be reserved for the trial judge might stand. No order as to costs was made by the Court of Appeal. The appellant will have its costs in this Court, including the costs of the motion for leave to appeal.\nABBOTT J. (dissenting):\u2014I regret that I am unable to share the view of the majority of the Court that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of McInnes J. restored. I am in substantial agreement with the reasons delivered by Davey J.A. in the Court below and I share his opinion that the learned chambers judge was without jurisdiction to make the order which he did. In the circumstances, I see no useful purpose to be served by adding anything to what he has said.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs in this Court, including the costs of the motion for leave to appeal, Abbott J. dissenting.\nSolicitor for the plaintiff, appellant: L. St. M. Du Moulin, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the defendant, respondent, British Columbia Electric Co. Ltd.: W. H. Q.

A counter-claim was filed by the defendant claiming a sum of money\u2014the balance owing for goods sold and delivered. The defendant pleaded that the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action and at the opening of the trial moved to have it struck out. The trial judge granted the motion to dismiss the action and allowed the counter-claim. This judgment was affirmed on appeal and the plaintiff then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nNeither s. 411(l)(c) nor s. 412(l)(a) and (2) of the Code gave a cause of action in damages to a person who alleged a breach of these sections by a defendant. This legislation creating a new crime was enacted solely for the protection of the public interest and did not create a civil cause of action. Transport Oil Ltd. v. Imperial Oil Ltd. and Cities Service Oil Co., [1935] O.R. 215, discussed; Cutler v. Wandsworth Stadium Ld., [1949] A.C. 398; Orpen v. Roberts, [1925] S.C.R. 364; Philco Products Ltd. et al. v. Thermionics Ltd. et al., [1940] S.C.R. 501, referred to.\nThe defence to the counter-claim, i.e., a plea that the sales in question were illegal transactions, the illegality being the violation of s. 412 of the Code, failed. The vendor sued only for the price of goods sold and delivered on a contract untainted by illegality. It was no defence to say that the vendor sold similar goods to another person for a lower price in breach of a statute. Assuming that the vendor did so, there was no connection between the illegality pleaded and the transaction in question.\nThe plaintiff's claim to commissions on sales made by the defendant to a third party also failed, the evidence not having established any contract to pay commissions on these sales.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division1, affirming a judgment of Primrose J. Appeal dismissed.\nG. Amerongen, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nT. Mayson, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014The appellant sued the respondent for damages, founding its cause of action upon an alleged breach by the respondent of two sections of the Criminal Code, s. 411(1)(c) and s. 412(1)(a) and (2), the first having to do with conspiracy to limit production or to enhance prices or to prevent or lessen competition, the second having to do with discrimination. The appellant is a lumber dealer and the respondent is a distributor of plywood and other building products. The precise claim was for $19,114.18 for price discrimination and $57,000 general damages for loss of sales. The respondent pleaded that this statement of claim disclosed no cause of action and at the opening of the trial moved to have it struck out. The learned trial judge did so and his judgment was affirmed on appeal2. It is apparent from the pleading and the course of the argument that the plaintiff's claim was really based upon price discrimination and not upon conspiracy. In any event, in my respectful opinion, the judgment under appeal is correct and neither section gives a cause of action in damages to a person who alleges a breach of these sections by a defendant.\nThe statement of claim simply pleads that during the years 1953 to 1959 the plaintiff bought from the defendant plywood and other materials for which it was charged $382,283.61, of which it paid $368,554.13. It says that in these transactions it was discriminated against to the extent of $19,114.18 because of discounts, allowances or price concessions granted by the defendant to other purchasers. It sues for this $19,114.18 and also for general damages.\nThe section relied upon reads:\n412. (1) Every one engaged in trade, commerce or industry who\n(a) is a party or privy to, or assists in, any sale that discriminates to his knowledge, directly or indirectly, against competitors of the purchaser, in that any discount, rebate, allowance, price concession or other advantage, is granted to the purchaser over and above any discount, rebate, allowance, price concession or other advantage, available at the time of such sale to such competitors in respect of a sale of goods of like quality and quantity;\nis guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.\n(2) It is not an offence under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) to be a party or privy to, or assist in any sale mentioned therein unless the discount, rebate, allowance, price concession or other advantage was granted as part of a practice of discriminating as described in that paragraph.\nI am satisfied, as was Johnson J.A. in the Court of Appeal after a full review of the cases culminating in Cutler v. Wandsworth Stadium Ld.3, that this criminal legislation gives no civil cause of action for its breach and I would affirm the judgment under appeal for the reasons given by Johnson J.A. that this legislation creating a new crime was enacted solely for the protection of the public interest and that it does not create a civil cause of action. There is no new principle involved and in spite of repeated consideration of the problem, nothing has been added to what was said about it by Duff J. in Orpen v. Roberts4:\nBut the object and provisions of the statute as a whole must be examined with a view to determining whether it is a part of the scheme of the legislation to create, for the benefit of individuals, rights enforceable by action; or whether the remedies provided by the statute are intended to be the sole remedies available by way of guarantees to the public for the observance of the statutory duty, or by way of compensation to individuals who have suffered by reason of the non-performance of that duty.\nAlthough there is no prior decision on the civil consequences quences of this legislation, the problem was touched in the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Transport Oil Ltd. v. Imperial Oil Ltd. and Cities Service Oil Co.5, which held there can be no claim for damages for conspiracy based upon a breach of the Combines Investigation Act\u2014a conspiracy closely related to that dealt with in the present s. 411 of the Code. The constitutionality of the legislation there in question was settled in Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. Attorney-General for Canada6, and it followed as a natural consequence that when this legislation relating to price discrimination was challenged in Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Attorney-General for Canada7, it was held to be a valid exercise of the power under s. 91, head 27, of the British North America Act.\nThe appellant's main submission to this Court on this branch of the case was that the Transport Oil case ought to be distinguished. This judgment was based on two grounds, the first being that as a matter of construction the legislation gave no civil cause of action, the second being the sweeping statement that under our dual legislative system, the Parliament of Canada in legislating in relation to criminal law intended to confine its legislation to crime and did not intend to interfere with provincial jurisdiction over property and civil rights. Some doubt has been expressed whether the second ground given by Middleton J.A. for supporting the legislation was really necessary to his decision. The first ground is clearly right and, in my opinion, as in that of Johnson J.A., ought to be adopted in this case.\nI recognize that there may be a difference between a common law action for damages based on conspiracy and one based on price discrimination. The common law itself imposes liability for harm caused by combinations to injure by unlawful means but the common law never gave any cause of action for price discrimination unaccompanied by conspiracy. To this extent some of the dicta in the Transport Oil case, which was a conspiracy case, may be open to question and it may well be doubted whether any constitutional principle is raised when dominion criminal legislation is silent upon the question whether a civil action arises upon breach of its terms. This doubt has been expressed by Wright in Cases on the Law of Torts, 2nd ed., 279; Laskin, Canadian Constitutional Law, 2nd ed., 863; and Finkelman, 13 Canadian Bar Review, 417, and it is probably the basis for the statement of Duff C.J. in Philco Products Ltd. et al. v. Thermionics Ltd. et al.8, when he said:\nIf B commits an indictable offence and the direct consequence of that indictable offence is that A suffers some special harm different from that of the rest of His Majesty's subjects, then, speaking generally, A has a right of action against B. As at present advised, I think it is not obvious that this well settled doctrine does not apply to indictable offences under section 498 of the Criminal Code; \u2026\nI would reject in this case the existence of the cause of action for the sole reason given by Johnson J.A.\nThe second point in this appeal arises from the counterclaim of the respondent-vendor for the sum of $13,729.48, being the balance owing for goods sold and delivered. The appellant-purchaser's defence to this counter-claim was a plea that these sales were illegal transactions, the illegality being the violation of s. 412 of the Criminal Code. The appellant-purchaser admits that it bought the goods and that it contracted to pay the price demanded. Its defence in substance is that it should not have to pay anything for these goods because the vendor sold similar goods to other people at a lower price. When stated in this way it is at once apparent that the defence of illegality fails. There was no illegality in the transaction between the vendor and the purchaser and the vendor was not involved in any proof of illegality in order to establish its claim. The vendor sued only for the price of goods sold and delivered on a contract untainted by illegality. It is no defence to a claim of this kind to say that the vendor sold similar goods to another person for a lower price in breach of a statute. Assuming that the vendor did so, there is no connection between the illegality pleaded and the transaction in question. Wilkinson v. Harwood and Cooper9, and Philco Products Ltd. et al. v. Thermionics Ltd. et al., supra. The amount of the claim was not disputed. Judgment was correctly given for the vendor on its counter-claim and this branch of the appeal fails.\nA third issue raised in this appeal is a claim by the appellant to commissions on sales made by the respondent to a third party. Evidence was heard on this claim and only on this claim. It appears that this third party had been buying goods from the appellant and that it told the respondent that unless it could purchase direct from the respondent it would look elsewhere for its supplies and that in no event would it deal with the appellant. Some evidence was given of a meeting between the officers of the two litigant companies at which it was said that the respondent would make things right and pay a three per cent commission on these direct sales. Only one commission was in fact ever paid, on March 23, 1956. The commission slip reads:\n3% on Poplar to Alldritt\nOctober 20th - End of 1955 ......................\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.226.92\nThe question of commission was never raised again until this action was instituted, in spite of the fact that dealings continued between the two companies until 1959. Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal have held that this agreement to pay commission, if there was such an agreement, offended the Statute of Frauds and I would not disagree with this finding. I think, however, that the evidence falls far short of establishing any contract to pay commission on these sales and that the payment on the one occasion was made by a volunteer under no legal obligation. The appeal also fails on this ground.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Amerongen & Burger, Edmonton.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Milner, Steer, Dyde, Massie, Layton, Cregan & Macdonnell, Edmonton.\n1 (1962), 37 WIE. 177, 32 D.L.R.

The lessee was given the option of purchasing the premises for a specified sum at any time during the first 5 years of the term, a condition of the option being that the lessee would give to the lessor 30 days\u2019 prior notice in writing of its intention so to purchase. On July 8, 1959, the lessee gave notice of its intention to purchase the leased premises pursuant to the option, and on the same day the lessor sent a letter to the lessee terminating the lease. This letter recited a failure to rectify what the lessor regarded was a breach of covenant. The landlord did not reply to the tenant\u2019s letter exercising the option but on July 23 served notice of an application for possession under s. 75 of The Landlord and Tenant Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 199. The county judge made an order directing the issue of a writ of possession. The Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from this order, and, subsequently, leave to appeal was granted by this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed, the judgments below set aside and the application of the respondent for possession of the lands dismissed.\nThe first 5 years of the lease expired at mid-night on July 14, 1959. The tenant\u2019s letter exercising the option was sent on July 8, 1959, and received on the following day. The option clause provided for a right exercisable at any time, within the first 5 years, which meant up to July 14, 1959. The provision for 30 day\u2019s prior notice in writing of the lessee\u2019s intention to purchase had reference to the lessor\u2019s obligation to deliver deeds and documents in his possession; it did not limit the right of the lessee to giving its notice 30 days prior to July 14, 1959. Accordingly, the option was validly exercised. At the time when the application was made before the county judge, the landlord and tenant relationship had ended and there was nothing for the county judge to decide. In assuming the subsistence of landlord and tenant relation, he was acting without jurisdiction.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dismissing an appeal from an order made by a Judge of the County Court of the County of Carleton directing the issue of a writ of possession. Appeal allowed.\nW.B. Williston, Q.C., and J. Sopinka, for the appellant.\nB.J. MacKinnon, Q.C., and B.A. Kelsey, for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014On July 15, 1954, Berger leased to Petrofina the lands in question for a term of 10 years to be computed from July 15, 1954. Clause 9 of the lease provided:\n9. That it will operate or cause to be operated upon the leased premises a motor vehicle service station according to good accepted practice and will maintain the premises in safe, clean and sanitary conditions in accordance with the nature of its use.\nIn 1958, Petrofina sublet the premises to one Ouimet. Approximately 6 months after taking possession, Ouimet extended his business to include body work, spray painting and temporary storage of vehicles, in addition to the sale of gasoline and oil.\nBy letters dated May 14, 1959, and June 26, 1959, Berger notified Petrofina that he regarded this use of the premises as a breach of the covenant and demanded remedy of the specified breach before July 6, 1959. Following the receipt of these letters, Petrofina says that the matters complained of were remedied and other improvements to the building, such as painting, and levelling and paving of the station lot, were completed.\nOn July 8, 1959, Petrofina gave notice of its intention to purchase the leased premises pursuant to the option contained in clause 4 of the lease. On the same day, Berger sent a letter to Petrofina terminating the lease. This letter recites a failure to rectify the breach of covenant set out in the two previous letters.\nBerger did not reply to Petrofina\u2019s letter exercising the option but on July 23, served notice of an application for possession under s. 75 of The Landlord and Tenant Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 199. The county judge made an order directing the issue of a writ of possession. The Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from this order. This Court granted leave to appeal on June 26, 1961.\nThe appellant submits that the Courts below were in error\n(a) in failing to hold that the appellant had validly exercised its option to purchase the leased premises before the respondent\u2019s application for possession was commenced and that the learned trial judge was without jurisdiction to hear the application;\n(b) in holding that the appellant was in breach of clause 9 of the lease in question. Clause 4 reads:\n4. That the Lessee shall have the irrevocable right at any time during the first five (5) years of the term hereof to purchase the leased premises in fee simple for the sum of Thirteen Thousand Dollars ($13,000.00). And that immediately upon the Lessee giving to the Lessor thirty (30) days\u2019 prior notice in writing of its intention so to purchase, the Lessor shall deliver to the Lessee such deeds and documents as he may have in his possession or under his control and relating, to the leased premises. Upon delivery by the Lessee to the Lessor of said notice, there shall be concluded a valid and binding agreement for sale of the leased premises (together with all buildings, improvements, fixtures, facilities and equipment now or hereafter located thereon) the terms of which shall immediately be embodied in a deed of sale. It is understood and agreed between the parties hereto that this right of purchase for a fixed sum shall, if necessary, be exercisable notwithstanding the covenant of the Lessor contained in the immediately preceding paragraph.\nThe first 5 years of the lease expired at midnight on July 14, 1959. Petrofina\u2019s letter exercising the option was sent on July 8, 1959. It was received the following day.\nThe first sentence in the option gives an irrevocable right during the first 5 years to purchase in fee for $13,000. It says at any time during the first five years. Then follows the clause which has given rise to so much difficulty:\nAnd that immediately upon the Lessee giving to the Lessor thirty (30) days\u2019 prior notice in writing of its intention so to purchase, the Lessor shall deliver to the Lessee such deeds and documents as he may have in his possession or under his control and relating to the leased premises.\nWhat is the meaning of giving 30 days\u2019 prior notice in writing of its intention so to purchase? The Courts below have construed this as meaning 30 days before the expiration of the first 5 years. The clause does not say that in express terms. Counsel for Berger also contends that the purchase must be completed within the first 5 years and on 30 days\u2019 prior notice. On the other hand, counsel for Petrofina says that the provision for 30 days\u2019 prior notice in writing has reference to the respondent\u2019s obligation to deliver deeds and documents in his possession and that it was inserted for the respondent\u2019s benefit to give him time to prepare and deliver the said documents. The submission is that it was merely a matter of conveyancing and that Petrofina was not obliged to give notice of intention 30 days prior to the expiry of the first 5 years because this would be inconsistent with its irrevocable right to purchase at any time during the 5 years. Parts 1 and 2 of the option clause must be read together and given some meaning. They must also be read along with the third part of the option clause, which reads:\nUpon delivery by the Lessee to the Lessor of said notice, there shall be concluded a valid and binding agreement for sale of the leased premises\u00bc\nThere is no difficulty about this last-mentioned clause. The parties do not wait for the expiry of thirty days to have a binding agreement of sale and purchase. If the notice was valid, according to this clause, on July 9, 1959, Petrofina became the owner in equity. The contract could have been enforced on either side in an action for specific performance.\nThere are, therefore, 3 parts of the option clause. The first provides for a right exercisable at any time within the first 5 years. That means up to July 14, 1959. The second provides for the notice. I do not think that this limits the right of Petrofina to giving its notice 30 days prior to July 14, 1959. I think that Petrofina\u2019s submission is correct on this point and I am strengthened in this conclusion by the third part of the clause, which provides for a binding agreement coming into force on July 9, 1959, not thirty days after the giving of notice.\nI would allow the appeal on this ground. The option was validly exercised. At the time when the application was made before the county judge, the landlord and tenant relationship had ended and there was nothing for the county judge to decide. In assuming the subsistence of landlord and tenant relation, he was acting without jurisdiction.\nThis makes an opinion unnecessary on the second branch of the appeal.\nThe appeal should be allowed. The judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario and of His Honour Judge P.J. MacDonald set aside and the application of the respondent for possession of the lands in question dismissed. The appellant is entitled to its costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs throughout.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fasken, Robertson, Aitchison, Pickup & Calvin, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Wright & McTaggart, Toronto.\n",

Dimitri and Leaside (Town), [1962] S.C.R. 656\nDate: 1962-06-25\nThe Whitehouse Properties Limited (Applicant) Appellant;\nand\nM. Dimitri, Building Inspector, and The Corporation of the Town of Leaside (Defendant) Respondents.\n1962: May 16, 17; 1962: June 25.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright, Abbott, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nMunicipal corporations\u2014Mandamus application to require issuing of building permit\u2014By-law passed exempting property from provisions of certain previous by-laws\u2014Approval of by-law refused by Municipal Board\u2014By-law not effective until approved by Board\u2014Refusal to issue permit justified.\nThe appellant sought an order of mandamus directed to the respondent D, building inspector of the Town of Leaside, requiring him to issue a permit for the construction of a building on certain lands in the municipality in accordance with plans and specifications complying with the requirements of by-laws 1550 and 1551 of the municipality. D refused to issue the permit on the grounds that the plans and specifications did not comply with by-law 1711, as amended by by-law 1740. Prior to the approval by the Ontario Municipal Board of by-laws 1711 and 1740, the municipality passed by-law 1748, as a result of negotiations between the appellant and officers of the municipality which took place after the enactment of by-laws 1711 and 1740 but prior to their approval by the Board. Subsequently, the Board refused to approve by-law 1748 and it was later repealed.\nThe appellant contended that the approval of by-laws 1711 and 1740 could not affect appellant\u2019s lands because prior to that approval those lands had been removed from the scope of by-laws 1711 and 1740 by by-law 1748 and that therefore its rights fell to be determined under by-laws 1550 and 1551. The application for a mandamus was dismissed by the chamber judge and an appeal from his judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. The appellant then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe words of clause 2 of by-law 1748 were clear and unambiguous and enacted that no part of the by-law should take effect until approved by the Board, an event which never happened. The conclusion that the by-law never took effect in whole or in part was sufficient to dispose of the appeal.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming a judgment of Wilson J. which dismissed the appellant\u2019s application for a mandamus. Appeal dismissed.\nH. E. Manning, Q.C., for the appellant. Royce H. Frith, for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] pronounced on January 31, 1962, affirming a judgment of Wilson J. dated October 16, 1961, which dismissed the appellant\u2019s application for a mandamus.\nThe appellant sought an order of mandamus directed to the respondent Dimitri, building inspector of the Town of Leaside, requiring him to issue a permit for the construction of an apartment house on certain lands situate on the east side of Bayview Avenue in the Town of Leaside in accordance with plans and specifications complying with the requirements of by\u2011laws 1550 and 1551 of the Town of Leaside, which the appellant alleged were the by-laws governing such site.\nThe respondent Dimitri refused to issue the said permit on the ground that the plans and specifications did not comply with by-law 1711, as amended by by-law 1740 of the Town of Leaside, which had been approved on the 6th day of May, 1960, by the Ontario Municipal Board.\nPrior to the approval of by-laws 1711 and 1740, the Council of the Town of Leaside had passed by-law 1748 on May 2, 1960, as a result of negotiations between the appellant and officers of the Town of Leaside which took place after the enactment of by-laws 1711 and 1740 but prior to their approval by the Ontario Municipal Board.\nThe appellant has contended throughout that the approval of by-laws 1711 and 1740 by the order of May 6, 1960, could not affect the appellant\u2019s lands because prior to that approval those lands had been removed from the scope of by-laws 1711 and 1740 by by-law 1748 and that therefore its rights fell to be determined under by-laws 1550 and 1551.\nIt is common ground that the plans submitted by the appellant do conform to the requirements of by\u2011laws 1550 and 1551 but do not conform to those of by-laws 1711 and 1740. It will be convenient to tabulate the dates of the relevant events.\nJune 4, 1956. By-law 1550 was passed.\nJuly 9, 1956. By-law 1551 was passed.\n(Both of these by-laws were approved by the Ontario Municipal Board; the exact date of approval is not material.)\nOctober 19, 1959. By-law 1711 was passed.\nMarch 7, 1960. By-law 1740 was passed.\nMay 2, 1960. By-law 1748 was passed.\nMay 6, 1960. Order made by Ontario Municipal Board approving by-laws\n1740 and 1711.\nMay 20, 1960. Application for permit made by appellant.\nJuly 12, 1960. Ontario Municipal Board refused to approve by-law 1748.\nOn a date after July 12, 1960, which is not fixed in the record by-law 1748 was repealed.\nSubsequent to July 12, 1960, further attempts were made by the appellant both before the Council and the Ontario Municipal Board to obtain a by-law or order requiring the granting of a permit; they were unsuccessful and do not affect the question before us.\nBy-law 1748 reads as follows:\nThe Council of the Corporation of the Town of Leaside enacts as follows:\u2014\n1. Notwithstanding the provisions of By-law 1711 as amended by By-law 1740, the provisions of the said by-law, as so amended, shall not apply to the following lands:\u2014\nLots 606, 607, 608 and 609, Plan 3110, known as 903, 905 and 907 Bayview Avenue, Town of Leaside,\nprovided that any building or structure erected on the said lands complies with the plans on file with the Building Inspector identified by Plan No. 6021 dated March 1960, and initialled by E.J. Brisbois, Chairman of the Planning Board.\n2. No part of this by-law shall take effect until approved by the Ontario Municipal Board but subject to such approval this by-law shall take effect from the date of passing thereof.\nPASSED and ENACTED this 2nd day of May, A.D. 1960.\nThe lands described in paragraph 1 of the by-law are those of the appellant on which the building described in the application for permit was proposed to be erected. The application for permit submitted by the appellant complied with the plans mentioned in paragraph 1 of this by-law. By-law 1711 and 1740 were passed pursuant to the powers conferred on the Council by s. 30 of The Planning Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 296 (or its predecessor).\nSubsections (9) and (10) of s. 30 read as follows:\n(9) No part of any by-law passed under this section comes into force without the approval of the Municipal Board, and such approval may be for a limited period of time only, and the Board may extend such period from time to time upon application made to it for such purpose.\n(10) No part of any by-law that repeals or amends a by-law passed under this section or a predecessor of this section and approved by the Municipal Board comes into force without the approval of the Municipal Board.\nIt is submitted for the appellant that on the date by-law 1748 was passed by-laws 1711 and 1740 had not been approved by the Board and the Council was free to amend them in any way it saw fit; reference is made to The Interpretation Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 191, s. 27(g) which reads:\n(g) where power is conferred to make by-laws, regulations, rules or orders, it includes power to alter or revoke the same from time to time anal make others;\nThere is no doubt that this is so. The argument proceeds, that, as prior to May 6, 1960, by\u2011laws 1711 and 1740 had been further amended by by-law 1748 so as to exclude the lands of the appellant from their operation, the order of the Board purporting to approve them as they read prior to the enactment of by-law 1748 was ineffective either in toto or, at all events, as regards the appellant\u2019s lands.\nThe first point to be considered in the examination of this argument is whether by-law No. 1748 came into force in whole or in part prior to the approval of by-laws 1711 and 1740 on May 6, 1960, and the question whether it did so is one of construction. It is argued for the appellant that the first part of clause 1, reading as follows:\nNotwithstanding the provisions of By-law 1711 as amended by By-law 1740 the provisions of the said by-law, as so amended, shall not apply to the following lands:\nLots 606, 607, 608 and 609, Plan 3110, known as 903, 905 and 907 Bay-view Avenue Town of Leaside\nis severable from the remainder of the by-law and should be regarded as unaffected by clause 2. It is pointed out that the portion of clause 1 reading as follows:\nprovided that any building or structure erected on the said lands complies with the plans on file with the Building Inspector identified by Plan No. 6021 dated March 1960, and initialled by E.J. Brisbois, Chairman of the Planning Board. while in form a proviso is in substance an enacting clause which would require the Board\u2019s approval and it is suggested that the draftsman inserted clause 2 of the by-law to cover this clause but not to cover the first part of clause 1 and that accordingly clause 2 should be construed as being limited in its operation to that part of clause 1 last quoted.\nI find myself unable to agree with this argument. The words of clause 2 of the by-law appear to me to be clear and unambiguous and to enact that no part of the by-law shall take effect until approved by the Board, an event which never happened. On this matter of construction I agree with Wilson J. and with Laidlaw J.A. who delivered the unanimous reasons of the Court of Appeal. It is unnecessary to consider whether the Council was required by law to so provide as it appears to me that it saw fit to do so.\nThe Ontario Municipal Board Act contemplates a municipality making voluntary applications to the Board for approval of its by-laws. Section 53(1) (6) provides:\n53(1) The Board has jurisdiction and power in relation to municipal affairs,\u2026\n(b) to approve any by-law or proposed by-law of a municipality, which approval the municipality voluntarily applies for or is required by law to obtain;\nThe conclusion that by-law 1748 never took effect in whole or in part is sufficient to dispose of the appeal.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Manning, Bruce, Paterson & Ridout, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Magwood, Frith & Casey, Toronto.\n[1] [1962] O.R. 390, 32 D.L.R.

(Defendants) Respondents.\n1962: May 3; 1962: June 11.\nPresent: Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.\non appeal from the court of queen's Bench, Appeal side, province of quebec.\nAccounts\u2014Action for accounting\u2014Order made for accounting only\u2014Court of Appeal reversing order\u2014Appeal to Supreme Court\u2014Motion to quash for lack of jurisdiction\u2014Verbal application for leave to appeal\u2014Code of civil Procedure, arts. 566 et seq.\nIn this action, the plaintiff asked that the defendants be ordered to render an accounting and that in default of rendering the account the defendants be ordered to pay certain sums of money. The trial judge ordered the rendering of an account, but did not order the payment of any sum of money. He came to the conclusion that the Court was not in a position to determine whether the plaintiff was entitled to any. The Court of Queen's Bench dismissed the action as it came to the conclusion that the defendants owed no accounting. The plaintiff appealed to this Court. The defendants moved to quash for lack of jurisdiction, and it was ordered that the motion to quash be heard at the game time as the merits of the case. During the hearing the plaintiff applied for leave to appeal in the event that it was decided that there was no appeal as of right.\nHeld: The motion to quash should be allowed and the application for leave to appeal dismissed.\nThere are two very distinct phases in an action for accounting. The first is to determine the right of the plaintiff to obtain an accounting, and the second is to apply arts. 567 et seq. if that right exists. Then if the defendant fails to render an account when he is condemned, the plaintiff may proceed to have such accounting made. But he cannot on the first phase be entitled to any sum of money unless the plaintiff and the defendant have both agreed to the contestations of accounts-before the trial judge. In the present case, the trial judge and the Court of Appeal have pronounced themselves only on the right of the plaintiff to obtain an account. There was, therefore, no amount of money involved at this stage of the proceedings, and, consequently, this. Court was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal. There was no valid reason to grant leave to appeal.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's. Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of C\u00f4t\u00e9 J. Appeal quashed.\nJ. G. Ahern, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant. N. A. Levitsky, for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014Haralampos Basilian Koutsogiannopoulos alias Harry Pulos, executive, of the City and District of Montreal, sued and asked in his action that the following defendants Dame Mary Speros Prahales alias Panos, wife contractually separate as to property of Haralampos, (known as Harry), Vacilikes alias Kay Speros Prahales alias Panos, and George Speros Prahales Panos, the last three Panos's in their quality of Executors and Trustees of the estate of the late Speros Theodore Prahales alias Panos; and the said George Speros Prahales Panos personally be ordered to render Plaintiff a detailed account, under art. 566 and following of the Code of Civil Procedure, and that in default of rendering the account within the delay fixed by the judgment, the defendants es-qualit\u00e9 be ordered to pay to the plaintiff the sum of $15,000, and the defendant George Panos the sum of $30,000 plus interest and costs.\nMr. Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 of the Superior Court of Montreal rendered the following judgment:\nFOR THESE REASONS, the Court DOTH ORDER the Defendants es qualite to render Plaintiff, within 30 days from these presents, a detailed account under oath, of the revenues belonging to Plaintiff which they have drawn, received and taken from the joint property as referred to and from System Theatre Company Limited and which should have been credited to Plaintiff, and to produce with said account all justification vouchers at the office of the Prothonotary of this Court; DOTH ORDER Defendant George Panos personally to render to Plaintiff, within 30 days, an accountting of his operation of the Candy and Refreshment Department administered by him for the period extending from 1937 to 1948, and to produce said account under oath with vouchers connected therewith at the office of. the Prothonotary of this Court; the whole with costs against the Defendants including the costs of Exhibits.\nThe learned trial judge merely ordered the rendering of an account by the defendant-respondents, but did not order the payment of any sum of money. He came to the conclusion that the Court was not in a position to determine whether the plaintiff was entitled to anything, and the judgment therefore only concerns the rights of the appellant to an accounting. The Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side)2 allowed the appeal, Rinfret J. dissenting, and reached the conclusion that the respondents owed no accounting to the appellant, and dismissed the action with costs.\nIn an action for accounting, there are two very distinct phases. The first to be determined is the right of the plaintiff to obtain an accounting (566 C.C.P.), and secondly, if that right does exist, then the dispositions of 567 C.C.P. and following have to be applied. If the defendant fails to render an account when he is condemned, the plaintiff may proceed to have such accounting made in the manner mentioned in art. 568 (578 C.C.P.). He cannot on the first issue, that is on the right to an accounting, be entitled to any sum of money, unless the plaintiff and the defendant have both agreed to the contestations of the accounts before the trial judge. See Racine v. Barry3; Chartrand v. Tremblay4; Cousineau v. Cousineau5.\nHere, this is not the case. The trial judge and the Court of Appeal have pronounced themselves only on the right of the plaintiff to obtain an accounting. There is, therefore, no amount of money involved at this stage of the proceedings.\nOn February 19, 1962, the respondents filed a motion to quash on the ground that this Court had no jurisdiction to hear this appeal, but it was ordered that the motion be heard at the same time as the merits of the case, which was then on the roll, so that the Court be in a better position, in the light of all the facts, to determine whether or not it had jurisdiction.\nIn view of what I have previously said, I believe that this Court is without jurisdiction to hear this appeal, and that the motion to quash should be granted with costs of such a motion.\nAt the hearing, a verbal application was made by counsel for the appellant asking for leave to appeal, but I see no valid reason why this request should be granted. This motion should be dismissed without costs.\nThe judgment of Fauteux and Martland JJ. was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014The respondents in this appeal applied to quash the appeal on the ground that this Court did not have jurisdiction to hear it because there was no money amount involved in the matter. Following argument on that application, it was ordered that the motion be heard at the same time that the appeal was argued on the merits. The main issue was fully argued and counsel for the appellant applied for leave to appeal in the event that it was decided that there was not an appeal as of right. Having heard full argument on the merits of the appeal, I would have been inclined to grant that application. However, in view of the conclusions reached by the majority of the Court, there is no point in expressing any final view on this point.\nMotion to quash granted with costs; Motion for leave to appeal dismissed without costs.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, appellant: Hyde & Ahern, Montreal.\nAttorney for the defendant, respondent: N.

In order to spread the risk involved, 75 per cent of the farmout interest was sold. The syndicate members decided to form a company to take over the remaining quarter interest and, in consequence, Ponder Oils Ltd. was incorporated, as a private company, on June 15, 1951. The members agreed at that time that the consideration for the transfer of their rights under the farmout to Ponder should be 748,000 fully paid shares of the company, and of this number the appellant was to receive 166,000 shares. By a formal agreement of September 25, 1951, stated to be effective from June 15, 1951, the syndicate's interest in the farmout was transferred to Ponder in consideration of the issue of 748,000 fully paid shares. The appellant was assessed on an additional $33,200 of income for 1951, on the basis that the Ponder shares which he received represented income in his hands for that year from an adventure in the nature of trade. This assessment was based on the proposition that the appellant did not acquire any right to his shares until after the successful completion of a second well on September 3, 1951, and at a time when, as a result of that successful completion the value of the Ponder shares had increased. The appellant's contention was that the agreement for the transfer of the farmout to Ponder for a share consideration was actually made before the drilling of the well had been commenced and that the shares to be received by the syndicate for the transfer, at that time, could have no value greater than the value of the actual asset which the syndicate was conveying to Ponder.\nAppeals by the appellant to the Tax Appeal Board and the Exchequer Court were dismissed. An appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld (Abbott and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Locke, Cartwright and Martland JJ.: On June 15, 1951, by agreement among the syndicate members, possession of their asset passed to a private company, which had no other assets, pursuant to an undertaking that they would receive 748,000 of its shares. These shares at that time could have a value no more and no less than the value of the asset turned over to the company. No profit could, at that time, accrue to the appellant in respect of the 166,000 shares to which he was then entitled.\nThe agreement of September 25 did no more than to evidence, in writing, an agreement which already existed. Consequently, it was not proper to attribute as income to the appellant the value placed upon his shares as of September 25, 1951.\nPer Abbott and Judson JJ., dissenting: It was not until the intention of the syndicate promoters was expressed in the formal agreement of September 25, 1951, that the appellant became entitled to receive the shares allotted to him. The shares were then worth substantially more than the appellant's interest in the syndicate on June 15, 1951. The result was that the appellant was properly assessed on the basis that the receipt by him as a syndicate member of the shares of Ponder was a receipt of income from a venture in the nature of trade.\nDoughty v. Commissioner of Taxes, [1927] A.C. 327, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of Thurlow J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, dismissing an appeal from a decision of the Tax Appeal Board. Appeal allowed, Abbott and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nJ. H. Laycraft, for the appellant.\nM. Bancroft and G. W. Ainslie, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Locke, Cartwright and Martland JJ. was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014In the year 1951 the appellant, along with three other persons, decided to acquire from Imperial Oil Limited (hereinafter called \"Imperial\") a farmout in respect of certain lands, the subject-matter of a petroleum and natural gas lease held by Imperial as lessee. The farmout was granted by Imperial by an agreement, in writing, dated May 25, 1951, to one of the members of the syndicate, Paul Moseson, who acted as representative for the group. There was already, at that time, a producing well on the lands. The agreement required the payment to Imperial of $40,000. Moseson undertook certain drilling commitments on the land. There was also provision for the delivery of specified quantities of any oil produced from any wells which were so drilled.\nIn order to spread the risk involved, agreements were made by Moseson with two companies, Central Explorers Limited (hereinafter called \"Central\") and Banff Oil Limited (hereinafter called \"Banff\"), whereby, in consideration of $30,000 paid by the former and $15,000 paid by the latter, together with their agreements to contribute toward the drilling costs involved in the drilling of the wells pursuant to the farmout, these two companies acquired between them a 75 per cent interest in the producing well and specified percentage interests in the wells subsequently to be drilled, toward the cost of which they were required to contribute.\nThe members of the syndicate agreed to incorporate a company to take over their interests under the farmout and, in consequence, Ponder Oils Ltd. (hereinafter called \"Ponder\") was incorporated, as a private company, on June 15, 1951, with an authorized capital consisting of 1,000,000 shares without nominal or par value. Out of the funds obtained as a result of the agreements with Central and Banff, $40,000 was paid to Imperial pursuant to the farmout agreement. The remaining $5,000 was placed in a special trust account and, subsequent to its incorporation, was turned over to Ponder.\nPursuant to the agreement with Imperial, production from the producing well on the property began to accrue for the benefit of the syndicate on May 26, 1951. The moneys thus received were also held in the same trust account which, after its incorporation, became the bank account of Ponder.\nThe drilling of a well on the lands, the subject-matter of the farmout, was commenced by Ponder on July 27, 1951. Drilling proceeded and calls were made from time to time upon Central and Banff for their contributions toward the drilling costs. The well was completed on September 3, 1951, and proved to be a successful producer of oil.\nPonder had been incorporated at the instance of the four members of the syndicate, who were the only persons beneficially interested in it until after the completion of the well. Until August 23, 1951, its directors were Moseson, the company's solicitor, and the solicitor's secretary. On that date the latter was replaced on the board of directors by the appellant.\nThe members of the syndicate had agreed, at the time Ponder was incorporated, as to the amount of their share interest in the company, to be received as consideration for the transfer to Ponder of all their rights under the farmout agreement. It had been agreed that 748,000 shares should be issued, fully paid, of which Moseson should receive 250,000 and each of the other three members 166,000. Moseson agreed to convey to Ponder certain other properties in which he, alone, was interested.\nThe formal documentation of some of these transactions lagged substantially behind the actual events. For example, although the payment of $15,000 had been promptly made by Banff and it had contributed its share of the cost of drilling the well, the written contract evidencing its interest was not actually executed until October 2, 1951. Similarly, the written agreement to evidence the transfer by Moseson to Ponder of the interest of the syndicate in the farmout agreement was not executed until September 25, 1951. That agreement recited the payment which had been made by Moseson to Ponder of the sum of $5,000. It provided for the issue of 748,000 fully paid shares of Ponder to Moseson and his nominees.\nIt was provided in this agreement that: \"This Indenture shall be effective as and from the 15th day of June, 1951, as if the same had been executed and delivered on that date.\"\nOn the same date a written agreement was executed by the four members of the syndicate, whereby Moseson agreed to cause the shares to be issued and allotted by Ponder as to 250,000 shares to himself and 166,000 shares to each of the other three members of the syndicate, who, in turn, agreed to accept such shares in full satisfaction of any claims and demands which they might have against Moseson in respect of the properties.\nSubsequent to the execution of these agreements, shares were allotted. Up to the time of the trial, the appellant had not disposed of any of his 166,000 shares.\nBefore these written agreements had been executed, Ponder had issued and allotted 251,997 of its shares at a price of 40 cents cash per share. Subsequent to that issue, on September 12, 1951, Ponder had been converted into a public company and its share capital had been increased by the creation of an additional 3,000,000 shares without nominal or par value.\nThe appellant has been assessed for income tax for the year 1951 on an additional $33,200 of income for that year, on the basis that the 166,000 shares of the capital stock of Ponder which he received represent income in his hands for that year from an adventure in the nature of trade. In determining this figure, the shares were valued at 20 cents each by a comparison with the price paid of 40 cents per share for the 251,997 shares issued in September, subject to a 50 per cent discount owing to the fact that the shares received by the appellant were subject to an escrow agreement.\nThis assessment is based on the proposition that the appellant did not acquire any right to his 166,000 shares until after the successful completion of the well on September 3,1951, and at a time when, as a result of that successful completion, the value of Ponder's shares had increased.\nThe appellant's contention is that the agreement for the transfer of the farmout to Ponder for a share consideration was actually made before the drilling of the well had been commenced and that the shares to be received by the syndicate for the transfer, at that time, could have had no value greater than the value of the actual asset which the syndicate was conveying to Ponder. He relies on the authority of Doughty v. Commissioner of Taxes2. At p. 336, Lord Phillimore, who delivered the judgment of the Privy Council, said:\nThe other ground on which the appellant's case may rest is that the transaction which led to the claim for tax was not a sale whereby any profit accrued to the two partners. The case of Craig (Kilmarnock) (1914 S.C. 338) just referred to is an authority for saying that the Crown is not entitled to take a mere bookkeeping entry as conclusive evidence of the existence of a profit. The two partners made no money by the mere process of having their stock in trade valued at a high rate when they transferred to a company consisting of their two selves.\nIf they overestimated the value of the stock the value of the several shares became less. The capital of the company would be to this extent watered. As already observed, they could not, by overestimating the value of the assets, make them more.\nThe appellant's appeal to the Tax Appeal Board was dismissed and his appeal from that decision was, in turn, dismissed by the Exchequer Court3. The basis of the decision in that Court is contained in the following extract from the reasons for judgment:\nNow Ponder Oils Limited came into existence on June 15, 1951, and from its inception or shortly afterwards appears to have obtained possession of the assets and rights of the syndicate and to have discharged the syndicate's obligations under the farmout contract. But it did not pay for the assets immediately, nor does the consideration for them appear to have been agreed upon between the syndicate and the company. Since Ponder was then a private corporation in which no one but the members of the syndicate was beneficially interested, it may be assumed that the syndicate could have dictated as the consideration to be paid by Ponder whatever they wished, whether in terms of money or shares. It might have been a very high consideration or a very low one or a reasonable one in either money or shares, but whatever it might be, to my mind it could at that time be worth no more than the value of what Ponder had. But while the members of the syndicate had in fact agreed among themselves, even before the incorporation of Ponder, to take a particular number of shares as the consideration, on the evidence I can discover nothing prior to the contract of September 25, 1951 from which any obligation of the company to issue such shares or any right of the syndicate or the members to demand them of the company can be held to have arisen. And even adopting the appellant's contentions to the point that the company was between June 15 and September 25 under an enforceable obligation to pay for what it had acquired from the syndicate, I am unable to find on its part any undertaking to pay in shares. If a contract between the company and the syndicate is to be inferred from the circumstances, including the receipt by Ponder of the production from the well, the carrying on by Ponder of the drilling and the collection by Ponder of the contributions of the participants, the inference I would draw is that Ponder took over the contract in circumstances from which a promise to pay would be implied, but to pay a reasonable sum rather than to issue shares, for I see nothing in what the company did from which a promise to issue shares may be inferred. And even if the receipt of $5,000 in cash as part of what was transferred be regarded as inconsistent with a contract to pay in money and, therefore, suggestive that the consideration was to be something else and probably shares, there was still no promise by the company to pay in shares to the exclusion of any other kind of payment. In my view, the syndicate's right to be paid by Ponder in shares arose for the first time on September 25, when their right to payment for what Ponder had acquired from them was converted from a right to be paid in some form to a definite right to shares.\nThere is, in this passage, at the very outset, a finding of fact that, from the inception of Ponder or shortly afterwards, that company obtained possession of the assets and rights of the syndicate and discharged the syndicate's obligations under the farmout agreement. This finding is, in my opinion, of great importance. Ponder had, with the consent of the members of the syndicate, taken over possession of the syndicate's asset, the farmout agreement, and, in turn, Ponder received the production from the completed well on the farmout property from and after May 26, 1951. The acquisition of that possession must have been by virtue of some agreement with the syndicate and, that being so, if the syndicate had sought against Ponder a direction for specific performance, the principle stated by Turner L.J. in Wilson v. West Hartlepool Railway Company4, adopted by Kay J. in Howard v. Patent Ivory Manufacturing Company5, would be applicable:\nWhere possession has been given upon the faith of an agreement, it is I think the duty of the Court, as far as it is possible to do so, to ascertain the terms of the agreement and to give effect to it.\nWhat were the terms of the agreement by virtue of which Ponder had become possessed of the assets of the syndicate? It is clear, on the evidence, that all members of the syndicate understood that there would be an issue of fully paid shares by Ponder to the syndicate members in consideration for the asset. The four members of the syndicate had agreed upon that consideration. They were the sole beneficial owners of Ponder, which, at that time, had issued only three qualifying shares, which were subject to the control of the syndicate members. One of the members of the syndicate, Moseson, was a director of Ponder and the other two directors were his nominees. This being so, it appears to me that when Ponder took possession of the asset the consideration which it was to pay had been agreed upon by everyone who was in a position to determine the intent of that company as to the consideration which it should pay. In my view, had he desired so to do, the appellant was in a position, once Moseson had turned over to Ponder possession of the syndicate assets in which he had an interest, to compel Moseson, as his trustee, to take the steps necessary to obtain the issuance to him of his 166,000 shares in the capital stock of Ponder.\nThat there was an agreement in existence before the execution of the written agreement between Moseson and Ponder on September 25 is recognized specifically in that document, in the clause which has been quoted earlier.\nThe reason why there had not been a written agreement at an earlier date is explained by the appellant in his evidence:\nBy Mr. Laycraft:\n................................\nQ. That document is dated September 25, 1951. When was the arrangement made? A. The arrangement was made in May, 1951.\nQ. Was the arrangement in fact carried out from the incorporation of Ponder Oils Limited? A. It was.\nQ. Why then is the document dated so much later? A. Mainly because Ponder Oils had no personnel to press on to get the documentation up-to-date until after the 1st of September, and they got this out as quickly as possible.\nQ. Do you continue to blame lawyers\u2014\nBy His Lordship:\nQ. The arrangement was made in May, 1951, but it was in fact carried out from the time of incorporation? A. Yes, Your Lordship.\nQ. You said something else. It is dated later because Ponder Oils had not\u2014what? A. They had no one to press on with the documentation or arrangements that had been made until after the 1st of September.\nBy Mr. Laycraft:\nQ. Do you continue to blame lawyers? A. Yes.\nThe position is, therefore, that by agreement among the syndicate members, possession of their asset passed to a private company, which had no other assets, pursuant to an understanding that they would receive 748,000 of its shares, fully paid, of which the appellant should receive 166,000. At that time Ponder had no issued shares other than the three qualifying shares held by its first directors. The 748,000 shares agreed to be issued to the syndicate members at that time could have a value no more and no less than the value of the asset which had been turned over to it. No profit could, at that time, accrue to the appellant in respect of the 166,000 shares to which he was then entitled.\nIn my opinion, the agreements of September 25 did no more than to evidence, in writing, agreements which already existed and, consequently, it is not proper to attribute as income to the appellant the value placed upon his 166,000 shares as of September 25.\nIn my opinion, the appeal should be allowed, with costs both in this Court and in the Exchequer Court, and the reassessment, dated December 17, 1956, as varied by the Minister, should be vacated.\nThe judgment of Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJudson J. (dissenting):\u2014The appellant is one of a syndicate of four persons who, in May of 1951, acquired a farmout agreement from Imperial Oil Limited. On June 15, 1951, the syndicate caused to be incorporated Ponder Oils Limited for the purpose of transferring to that company the asset to be exploited. The question at issue in this appeal is whether the company was bound by agreement to issue shares for the asset on June 15, 1951, or whether that obligation arose for the first time on September 25, 1951. The importance of the date is that in the interval the property had proved to be valuable and Falconer had made a substantial profit as a member of the syndicate.\nThe Exchequer Court, after a careful and detailed review of the dealings among the syndicate members and between them and the company, concluded that there was no agreement for the issue of shares until September 25, 1951, and that consequently, tax was payable.\nThe syndicate acquired the farmout agreement by an agreement in writing dated May 25, 1951. There was probably a prior oral agreement because on May 17, 1951, it sold a half interest in the farmout agreement for $30,000. By an agreement in writing dated October 2, 1951, the syndicate also sold a quarter interest for $15,000. This $15,000 was paid by the purchaser of the quarter interest long before the formal date of the agreement. I say this because as a result of the two sales comprising the three-quarter interest, the syndicate received $45,000 in cash, of which it paid $40,000 to Imperial Oil. This $40,000 was the purchase price under the farmout agreement. These two purchasers of the half interest and quarter interest respectively agreed to contribute to the drilling costs in the proportions of their interest.\nOn June 15, 1951, Ponder Oils Limited came into being as a private company with an authorized capital stock of one million shares n.p.v. Drilling began in July of 1951 and by September 3, 1951, there was a well in production. On September 12, 1951, Ponder Oils Limited was converted into a public company and its authorized capital was increased by the creation of an additional three million shares n.p.v. Shortly before this happened, the company had sold 251,997 shares privately at 40 cents per share. In addition, there were three qualifying shares outstanding.\nThe next step was the execution of the formal agreement between Paul Moseson, the syndicate manager, and Ponder Oils Limited. It was dated September 25, 1951, and it provided that it should be effective from June 15, 1951, as if it had been executed and delivered on that date. It recites the following facts:\n(a) The acquisition of the farmout agreement from Imperial Oil Limited by agreement dated May 25, 1951.\n(b) The sale of the half interest by agreement dated May 17, 1951.\n(c) The agreement to sell the quarter interest. (This is the agreement which was not put in writing until October 2, 1951.)\n(d) The existence of a lease known as the Berube lease held by Moseson and at that time the subject-matter of litigation in the Supreme Court of Alberta.\n(e) Moseson's holding of four units in the Kavanagh Oil syndicate.\nMoseson then transfers to the company the remaining one-quarter interest in the Imperial farmout agreement in consideration of the issue of 748,000 fully paid shares n.p.v. The company also acknowledges receipt of $5,000 from Moseson. This is the balance of $5,000 remaining from the proceeds of the sale of the half interest and the quarter interest. This money appears to have been turned over to Ponder immediately on its receipt.\nMoseson agrees to prosecute the action to establish the Berube lease and to assign it to the company if the action is successful. Moseson also transfers his interest in the Kavanagh certificate, Ponder to assume Moseson's liability of $1,000 in respect of this.\nIn addition to issuing the shares, Ponder agrees to indemnify Moseson against all his liabilities under the Imperial farmout agreement, also to indemnify him if the purchaser of the quarter interest took a certain course of action.\nThis is obviously an elaborate agreement defining the relations between the syndicate and the company. The 748,000 shares were issued in escrow and were divided as follows:\nP. E. Moseson .................................... 250,000 shares\nW. L. Falconer .................................... 166,000 shares\nT. A. Link ............................................ 166,000 shares\nA. W. Nauss ....................................... 166,000 Shares\nMoseson received 84,000 more shares than each of the others because he alone was interested in the Berube lease and the Kavanagh syndicate. As stated above, the problem is whether the appellant Falconer realized a profit on September 25, 1951, from the receipt of these shares.\nThe findings of the learned trial judge are as follows:\nIn my view, the syndicate's right to be paid by Ponder in shares arose for the first time on September 25, when their right to payment for what Ponder, had acquired from them was converted from a right to be paid in some form to a definite right to shares.\nThe material fact, in my opinion, is that through carrying out their scheme, the syndicate became entitled to shares on September 25, but not until then, and thereby realized profit from their scheme in the form of a right to shares. September 25, in my opinion, is accordingly the date at which the right to the shares to which the appellant became entitled should be valued.\nIn addition, the evidence shows, although not very clearly, that it was Ponder that actually conducted the drilling operations. How Ponder was financed during this interval to enable it to operate does not appear. The evidence also seems to show that from the moment of the acquisition of the property the syndicate members intended to incorporate Ponder and to turn over the property to the company for a certain number of shares. I am not satisfied on the evidence that the Berube lease and the Kavanagh syndicate interest were ever intended to be included in the deal until the written agreement came to be executed.\nBut these were merely the intentions of the promoters. No corporate action whatever was taken along these lines until September 25, 1951. There were no meetings of directors to approve of any agreement with the syndicate. The company appears to have done nothing in a corporate way beyond holding the formal meetings to get itself organized. It did not agree to issue any shares. It received no transfer of the farmout agreement. It did receive the $5,000 from Moseson and it did spend money for the development of the property. It seems to me quite impossible to hold that on June 15, 1951, there was a contract between the company and the syndicate for the transfer of these property interests mentioned in the agreement of September 25 in consideration of the allotment by the company of the 748,000 shares. Until the date of the formal agreement everything depended upon the intention of the syndicate promoters. Neither party could, on June 15, 1951, have proved the existence of a concluded contract on these terms and an action for specific performance by either party to enforce such terms would have failed. This contract is a bilateral matter. What the promoters intended to do when they had time to attend to the business does not establish a contract. The position between the two dates is that the company was apparently in possession of the property, developing the property at its own expense on the money from some unknown source. It is possible that the company might have established a right to acquire the property on payment of a reasonable price, although I am doubtful of that, but I am in complete agreement with the finding of the learned trial judge that it was not until September 25,1951, that the company came under any obligation to issue a defined number of shares for the property, including the Berube lease and the Kavanagh syndicate interest. The appellant's right to receive the shares thus arose for the first time on September 25, 1951. The shares were then worth substantially more than the appellant's interest in the syndicate on June 15, 1951. The result is that the appellant was properly assessed on the basis that the receipt by him as a syndicate member of the shares of Ponder was a receipt of income from a venture in the nature of trade. The case is not within the principle of Doughty v. Commissioner of Taxes6.\nThe remaining question is whether the shares were properly valued for the purpose of computing the tax. After reviewing the evidence of dealings in the shares and after discounting the value of these shares because they were subject to escrow, the learned trial judge affirmed the Minister's valuation at 20 cents per share. I can find no reason for disturbing this assessment.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed, Abbott and Judson JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Chambers, Might, Saucier, Peacock, Jones, Black & Gain, Calgary.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

(Petitioner) Appellant;\nand\nAndr\u00e9 Trottier (Trustee) Respondent.\n1962: February 22; 1962: June 11.\nPresent: Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nBankruptcy\u2014Landlord and tenant\u2014Claim for arrears of rent and for costs of repairs\u2014Whether landlord a secured creditor\u2014Whether both claims preferred\u2014The Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 14, ss. 95, 100, 105\u2014Civil Code, arts. 1619, 1624, 1628, 1994, 2005.\nThe petitioner, as landlord of the premises occupied by the bankrupt, filed with the trustee a preferred claim in respect of three months arrears of rent due by the bankrupt and also in respect of costs of certain repairs for which the bankrupt was liable under the terms of the lease. The trustee allowed the amount claimed for arrears of rent as a preferred claim, but refused to consider the claim for repairs as a preferred claim. The trial judge held that the petitioner was entitled to rank by preference for both claims. That judgment was reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench and the decision of the trustee was restored. The petitioner obtained leave to appeal to this Court. The petitioner contended that s. 95 of The Bankruptcy Act dealt merely with the order in which a landlord was entitled to be collocated by preference, and that the extent of that preference under the provincial law was preserved by s. 105.\nHeld: Only the claim for arrears of rent was entitled to priority.\nSubject to priority of ranking under s. 95 of The Bankruptcy Act, by virtue of s. 105 the nature and extent of the landlord's claim for rent or damages and any other rights he may have arising out of the contract of lease are determined by the law of the province in which the leased premises are situated. However, in the event of bankruptcy; the right of the landlord to be collocated and paid by preference, and the extent of that preference, are clearly provided for in s. 95. That preference ranks sixth in order of priority and is limited as provided for by s. 95. Furthermore, by the combined effect of ss. 95, 100 and 105, the landlord is entitled to rank only as an unsecured creditor for any balance to which he may be entitled under provincial law.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Mitchell J. Appeal dismissed.\nA. Denis, Q.C., for the petitioner, appellant.\nJ. P. Bergeron, Q.C., and P. E. Blain, for the trustee, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014Appellant is a creditor of Gingras Automobile Lt\u00e9e, a bankrupt, and respondent is the trustee of the estate of the said bankrupt. At the date of the receiving order a valid lease existed between the debtor and appellant covering premises occupied by the debtor and with respect to which three months' arrears of rent amounting to $1,800 were outstanding. In addition, appellant was entitled to claim from the debtor a sum of $1,398.22 representing the cost of certain repairs for which the debtor was liable under the terms of its lease. Appellant's total claim against the debtor amounted therefore to $3,198.22, for which it filed a claim with respondent, alleging that it was entitled to be paid its entire claim by preference.\nIt is conceded that at the date of the receiving order sufficient moveable property was located upon the leased premises to secure payment of the full amount claimed.\nThe trustee allowed the amount claimed for arrears of rent as a preferred claim but disallowed the balance. On appeal to the Superior Court that decision was reversed and appellant held entitled to rank by preference for the whole amount of its claim. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench2, that judgment was reversed and the decision of the trustee restored. The present appeal, by leave, is from that judgment.\nThe facts are not in dispute and the sole questions in issue on this appeal are ones of law. Under the provincial law, appellant was entitled to be paid a sum of $3,198.22 and payment of that claim was secured by privilege on the moveable property located on the leased premises: arts. 1619 et seq. and 2005 of the Civil Code. That privilege consisted in the right to seize and sell such moveable property and to be paid by preference out of the proceeds: Faribault, Trait\u00e9 de Droit civil, t. 2, p. 112. In the event of competing claims, under the law of Quebec the landlord's privilege ranks eighth in order of preference: art. 1994 of the Civil Code.\nThe legal question in issue here is, to what extent if any the provincial law has been abrogated by the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 14.\nIn 1949 all existing bankruptcy legislation was repealed and a new Bankruptcy Act enacted, 13 Geo. VI, c. 7, now R.S.C. 1952, c. 14. The previously existing statute was completely re-cast and many important changes made including changes in the preferential right of the landlord.\nThe present Act, like its predecessor acts, provides that subject to the Act all debts proved in bankruptcy shall be paid pari passu. To that rule of absolute equality, certain exceptions are made including those provided for by s. 95. The exclusive authority given to Parliament by s. 91(21) of the British North America Act to deal with all matters arising within the domain of bankruptcy and insolvency, enables Parliament to determine the relative priorities of creditors under a bankruptcy: Royal Bank v. Larue3. To the extent that such priorities may be in conflict with provincial law, the federal statute must prevail. In his argument before us Mr. Denis did not of course challenge that proposition. He contended, however, that s. 95 of the Act dealt merely with the order in which a landlord was entitled to be collocated by preference, and that the extent of that preference under the provincial law was preserved by s. 105. With deference I am unable to agree with that submission. The relevant portions of s. 95 and s. 105 are as follows:\n95. (1) Subject to the rights of secured creditors, the proceeds realized from the property of a bankrupt Shall be applied in priority of payment as follows: \u2026\n(f) the landlord for arrears of rent for a period of three months next preceding the bankruptcy and accelerated rent for a period not exceeding three months following the bankruptcy if entitled thereto Under the lease, but the total amount so payable shall not exceed the realization from the property on the premises under lease, and any payment made on account of accelerated rent shall be credited against the amount payable by the trustee for occupation rent:\u2026\n(3) A creditor whose rights are restricted by this section is entitled to rank as an unsecured creditor for any balance of claim due to him.\n105. Except as to priority of ranking as provided by section ninety-five, and subject to the provisions of subsection four of section forty-two, the rights of landlords shall be determined according to the laws of the province in which the leased premises are situate.\n\"Secured creditor\" is defined by s. 2(r) as follows:\n\"secured creditor\" means a person holding a mortgage, hypothec, pledge, charge, lien or privilege on or against the property of the debtor or any part thereof as security for a debt due or accruing due to him from the debtor, or a person whose claim is based upon, or secured by, a negotiable instrument held as collateral security and upon which the debtor is only indirectly or secondarily liable; \u2026\nThe interpretation and effect of these sections were considered by the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan in Canadian Credit Men's Trust Association Ltd. v. Carman Block Ltd.4.\nIn my respectful opinion, Gordon J.A. accurately stated the law when he said at p. 162:\nWith every deference I do not think a landlord with a claim for arrears of rent falls within the definition of a \"secured creditor\". He has no lien on the property seized but must give it up to the trustee and file his claim in the usual way. He has no security to value within the provisions of ss. 87-92 of The Bankruptcy Act. Further, I do not think that any such inference should be drawn in the face of the explicit directions contained in s. 95 of the Act. So far as I can see the Act deprives the landlord of his right of lien and merely uses the value of the property seized as a gauge to fix the amount for which he is allowed a preferred claim but does not make him a \"secured creditor\". Subject to priority of ranking under s. 95 (and to s. 42(4) which has no relevance here) in virtue of s. 105 the nature and extent of the landlord's claim for rent or damages and any other, rights he may have arising out of the contract of lease are determined by the law of the province in which the leased premises are situated.\nIn my opinion however, in the event of bankruptcy, the right of the landlord to be collocated and paid by preference, and the extent of that preference, are clearly provided for in s. 95. Shortly stated, such preference ranks sixth in order of priority.

Hicklin still applicable\u2014Evidence by experts as to purpose of author and as to literary and artistic merits of book\u2014Whether admissible\u2014Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 150(8) (as enacted by 1959, c. 41, s. 11), and s. 150A(4) (as enacted by 1959, c. 41, s. 12).\nOn an information laid under s. 150A of the Criminal Code, copies of a book entitled \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" by D. H. Lawrence, were seized on the accused's premises on the allegation that the book was an obscene publication under s. 150(8) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge found the book to be obscene and ordered its confiscation. This judgment was unanimously affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side. The accused were granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld (Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke and Fauteux JJ. dissenting): The book \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" was not an obscene publication.\nPer Cartwright J.: Assuming, without deciding the point, that the definition of the word \"obscene\" contained in s. 150(8) of the Code is exhaustive, as was contended by counsel for the accused and conceded by counsel for the Crown, for the reasons given by Judson J., the book in question was not obscene.\nPer Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.: The definition of \"obscenity\" introduced in 1959 by s. 150(8), enacted for the purposes of proceedings under the Code, precludes the application of any other test. Consequently, the test in R. v. Hicklin, L.R. 3 Q.B. 360, and all the jurisprudence thereunder was rendered obsolete by the enactment of this new and exhaustive definition. Under the definition, there must be a characteristic which is dominant and this dominant characteristic must amount to an exploitation of sex which is undue. The search for such a dominant characteristic involves the reading of the whole book and also involves an inquiry into the purpose of the author. One cannot ascertain a dominant characteristic of a book without an examination of its literary or artistic merit, and this renders admissible the evidence of the author and others on this point. There was real unanimity in the opinions of the witnesses that the book was a true and sincere representation of an aspect of life as it appeared to the author. The phrase \"undue exploitation\" is aimed at excessive emphasis on the theme of sex for a base purpose. Measured by the internal necessities of the novel, there was no such undue exploitation. There was no more emphasis on the theme of sex than was required in the treatment of such a serious work of fiction. No matter whether \"undue exploitation\" is to be measured by the internal necessities of the novel itself or by offence against community standards, this novel does not offend.\nPer Ritchie J.: The language of s. 150(8) does not constitute an exclusive definition of \"obscenity\" for the purposes of the Criminal Code. That language cannot be construed as meaning that no publication can be obscene for the purpose of the Code unless it has undue exploitation of sex as a dominant characteristic. Section 150(8) has the effect of expanding the meaning of \"obscene\" to include all publications which have undue exploitation of sex as a dominant characteristic whether or not they can be shown to have a tendency to corrupt and deprave. The word \"undue\" carried the meaning of \"undue having regard to the existing standards of decency in the community\". The inquiry as to whether a publication is likely to corrupt a significant segment of the population and as to what is or what is not \"undue\" so as to offend community standards, involves the reading and consideration of the publication as a whole. It is not only relevant but desirable to consider evidence of the opinions of qualified experts as to the artistic and literary qualities of the publication. Although sex is a dominant characteristic of the book and although there are isolated passages which, when read alone, unduly exploit sex, it does not follow that these passages, read as a part of the whole book, have the effect of making the undue exploitation which they contain a dominant characteristic of the publication so as to bring it within s. 150(8). Furthermore, no significant segment of the population was likely to be depraved or corrupted by reading the book as a whole. In any event, the defence of the public good was available under s. 150A so that any harmful effect which these objectionable passages might have is counterbalanced by the desirability of preserving intact the work of a writer who, on the evidence in this case, was regarded as a great artist by respectable teachers, authors and critics.\nPer Kerwin C.J., dissenting: It was unnecessary to deal with the argument that the Crown having cross-examined the witnesses, could not now say that their evidence was inadmissible, because Parliament has prescribed that under s. 150(8) an objective test be applied. The rule in R. v. Hicklin is not the one to be followed in applying s. 150(8) of the Code. Under that subsection, a publication is deemed to be obscene if (a) a dominant characteristic of the publication is (b) the undue exploitation (c) of sex. The claim of the witnesses and of the judgments in the Courts of England and the United States that the dominant characteristic of the book is to show the evils of industrialism in England and the damage it does to the human soul, is not substantiated by a careful reading of the book. The use of \"four-letter words\" by itself might or might not make a book one in which sex was exploited unduly so as to make that feature a dominant characteristic, but they could not be treated in isolation from the scenes depicted in which they were used. The witnesses called on behalf of the accused have not succeeded in showing that this is a work of art in which there is no undue exploitation of sex and that that is not the dominant characteristic of the book. Although the evidence was competent to show the merits of the book as a work of art, the tribunals would still have to determine whether a dominant characteristic of the book was the undue exploitation of sex. In the present case, the answer must be in the affirmative.\nPer Taschereau J., dissenting: The decision of R. v. Hicklin is no longer the law of the land. It is unnecessary to determine whether s. 150(8) is exhaustive or not, since if there is to be found in the book a dominant characteristic which is the undue exploitation of sex, the book must be banned. Without deciding as to its legality or illegality, too much weight has been attached to the expert evidence adduced. A more objective legal aspect of the question has to be considered. The author relies on sex and adultery to dissolve the clouds of social evils that he believes are hanging over the skies of England. In doing so, he violates s. 150(8) of the Code. \"Undue\" means \"unreasonable\", \"unjustifiable\". The book comes clearly within the ban of the Code as there is an undue exploitation of sex which is \"a dominant\" characteristic of the work. Even if the book were a work of art, art can co-exist with obscenity and does not exclude it.\nPer Locke J., dissenting: The book is an obscene publication within the definition of s. 150(8) of the Criminal Code.\nPer Fauteux J., dissenting: While s. 150(8) of the Code is effective to expand the meaning of \"obscenity\" so as to include a publication a dominant characteristic of which is exploitation of sex, it does not purport to be an exhaustive definition of obscenity excluding the test found in R. v. Hicklin and all the Canadian and English jurisprudence in application of that case. The evidence of experts in literature has always been excluded under the Hicklin jurisprudence as irrelevant to the test and there does not appear to be any valid reason why this rule should be varied with respect to the test under s. 158(8) whether, having regard to the existing standards of decency in the community, the exploitation of sex has been carried to a shocking and disgusting point. The book in question can be accurately described as replete with descriptions in minute detail of sexual acts with the use of filthy, offensive and degrading words and terms. Whether admissible or not, expert evidence as to the literary merit of the book is clearly ineffective to change this view. Whether one applies the law as it stood prior to or as expanded by the 1959 amendments, \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" is an obscene publication under the Criminal Code of Canada. APPEALS from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Fontaine J. Appeals allowed, Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Locke and Fauteux JJ. dissenting.\nF. R. Scott, Q.C., and M. Shacter, for the appellants.\nC. Wagner, Andr\u00e9 Tessier, Q.C., and Gabriel Houde, Q.C., for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting):\u2014By leave of this Court Brodie, Dansky and Rubin appeal from judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench of the Province of Quebec2 dismissing their appeals from judgments of the Court of Sessions of the Peace for the District of Montreal declaring a certain book \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\", by D. H. Lawrence, to be obscene and forfeited to Her Majesty in accordance with the provisions of s. 150A of the Criminal Code of Canada. The three appeals raise the same question and it is sufficient to deal with the case of Brodie.\nSection 150 of the Criminal Code including subs. 8 which was enacted July 18, 1959, by 7-8 Eliz. II, c. 41, and s. 150A of the Code enacted at the same time by the same chapter read as follows:\n150. (1) Every one commits an offence who\n(a) makes, prints, publishes, distributes, circulates, or has in his possession for the purpose of publication, distribution or circulation any obscene written matter, picture, model, phonograph record or other thing whatsoever, or\n(b) makes, prints, publishes, distributes, sells or has in his possession for the purpose of publication, distribution or circulation, a crime comic.\n(2) Every one commits an offence who knowingly, without lawful justification or excuse,\n(a) sells, exposes to public view or has in his possession for such a purpose any obscene written matter, picture, model, phonograph record or other thing whatsoever,\n(b) publicly exhibits a disgusting object or an indecent show,\n(c) offers to sell, advertises, publishes an advertisement of, or has for sale or disposal any means, instructions, medicine, drug or article intended or represented as a method of preventing conception or causing abortion or miscarriage, or\n(d) advertises or publishes an advertisement of any means, instructions, medicine, drug or article intended or represented as a method for restoring sexual virility or curing venereal diseases or diseases of the generative organs. (3) No person shall be convicted of an offence under this section if he establishes that the public good was served by the acts that are alleged to constitute the offence and that the acts alleged did not extend beyond what served the public good.\n(4) For the purposes of this section it is a question of law whether an act served the public good and whether there is evidence that the act alleged went beyond what served the public good, but it is a question of fact whether the acts did or did not extend beyond what served the public good.\n(5) For the purposes of this section the motives of an accused are irrelevant.\n(6) Where an accused is charged with an offence under subsection (1) the fact that the accused was ignorant of the nature or presence of the matter, picture, model, phonograph record, crime comic or other thing by means of or in relation to which the offence was committed is not a defence to the charge.\n(7) In this section, \"crime comic\" means a magazine, periodical or book that exclusively or substantially comprises matter depicting pictorially\n(a) the commission of crimes, real or fictitious, or\n(b) events connected with the commission of crimes, real or fictitious, whether occurring before or after the commission of the crime.\n(8) For the purposes of this Act, any publication a dominant characteristic of which is the undue exploitation of sex, or of sex and any one or more of the following subjects, namely, crime, horror, cruelty and violence, shall be deemed to be obscene.\n150A. (1) A judge who is satisfied by information upon oath that there are reasonable grounds for believing that any publication, copies of which are kept for sale or distribution in premises within the jurisdiction of the court, is obscene or a crime comic, shall issue a warrant under his hand authorizing seizure of the copies.\n(2) Within seven days of the issue of the warrant, the judge shall issue a summons to the occupier of the premises requiring him to appear before the court and show cause why the matter seized should not be forfeited to Her Majesty.\n(3) The owner and the author of the matter seized and alleged to be obscene or a crime comic may appear and be represented in the proceedings in order to oppose the making of an order for the forfeiture of the said matter.\n(4) If the court is satisfied that the publication is obscene or a crime comic, it shall make an order declaring the matter forfeited to Her Majesty in right of the province in which the proceedings take place, for disposal as the Attorney General may direct.\n(5) If the court is not satisfied that the publication is obscene or a crime comic, it shall order that the matter be restored to the person from whom it was seized forthwith after the time for final appeal has expired.\n(6) An appeal lies from an order made under subsecion (4) or (5) by any person who appeared in the proceedings\n(a) on any ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone,\n(b) on any ground of appeal that involves a question of fact alone, or (c) on any ground of appeal that involves a question of mixed law and fact,\nas if it were an appeal against conviction or against a judgment or verdict of acquittal, as the case may be, on a question of law alone under Part XVIII and sections 581 to 601 apply mutatis mutandis.\n(7) Where an order has been made under this section by a judge in a province with respect to one or more copies of a publication, no proceedings shall be instituted or continued in that province under section 150 with respect to those or other copies of the same publication without the consent of the Attorney General.\n(8) In this section,\n(a) \"court\" means a county or district court or, in the Province of Quebec\n(i) the court of the sessions of the peace, or\n(ii) where an application has been made to a district magistrate for a warrant under subsection (1), that district magistrate,\n(b) \"crime comic\" has the same meaning as it has in section 150, and\n(c) \"judge\" means a judge of a court or, in the Province of Quebec, a district magistrate.\nIt was under the provisions of s. 150A that an information was laid and a summons issued to Brodie as the occupant of premises within the jurisdiction of the Court of the Sessions of the Peace. A copy of the book seized was put in evidence. Under reserve by the judge of counsel's right so to do, witnesses were called on behalf of Brodie and were cross-examined to some extent. It has been contended on behalf of the appellant that having cross-examined the witnesses the Crown cannot now be heard to say that their evidence was inadmissible. There is a good deal to be said for this argument but it is unnecessary to deal with the point because, in my view, by subs. 8 of s. 150 Parliament has prescribed that an objective test be applied. Before the enactment of subs. 8 the rule laid down by Chief Justice Cockburn in R. v. Hicklin3 had been applied in England and in various Courts in Canada. This was to the effect that the test of obscenity was whether the tendency of the matter charged is \"to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall\". I agree with counsel for the appellant that this is not the rule to be followed in applying the amendment and that the judge of first instance was in error in so doing. It was argued that notwithstanding statements of intention to the contrary the judges in the Court of Queen's Bench applied the Hicklin rule. I am unable so to read their reasons, but, in any event, I desire to make it clear that I do not apply it.\nSo far as relevant to this appeal, under subs. 8 of s. 150 of the Code, a publication is to be deemed obscene if (a) a dominant characteristic of the publication is (b) the undue exploitation (c) of sex. The witnesses called on behalf of the appellant and some, if not all, of the judgments in Courts in England and the United States, put in by his counsel, claim that the dominant characteristic of the book is to show the evils of industrialism in England and the damage it does to the human soul. A careful reading of the book satisfies me that this is not so. This view is based not merely on the comparatively short space allotted to any such thing as compared with that taken up with sex, but on a comprehensive view of the publication. Another matter relied on is the alleged preeminence of \"blood knowledge\" over \"mind knowledge\" in the lives of human beings. These terms were invented by Lawrence, it is said, to show that the animal state of man's nature should be in better balance with mind knowledge.\nThe use of \"four-letter words\" by itself might or might not make a book one in which sex was exploited unduly so as to make that feature a dominant characteristic, but they cannot be treated in isolation from the scenes depicted in which they are used. The witnesses called on behalf of the appellant have not succeeded in showing that this is a work of art in which there is no undue exploitation of sex and that that is not the dominant characteristic of the book. I pay no attention to the price charged for the book but it is not without significance that on the cover above the title \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\u2014D. H. Lawrence\" appears: \"Complete Unexpurgated Authentic Authorized Edition\" and that below the title appears the following: \"'This Signet Edition is the only complete unexpurgated version of LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER authorized by the estate of Frieda Lawrence for United States publication' Laurence Pollinger Literary Executor to the estate of the late Mrs. Frieda Lawrence\". By themselves these matters might appear insignificant but notwithstanding the protestations of the representative of the publishers they lend weight to the conclusion arrived at. By reason of war wounds, the husband of Lady Chatterley was rendered impotent and, in order, as in substance the author puts it, that the wife should not be frustrated, she approached Mellors, her husband's gamekeeper, who was separated from his wife. In fact, she led him to the relationship that is afterwards set out in such great detail. There is not merely a description of one episode only, but of several, and it is sufficient to state that all of them are set forth in great detail that might have been expected in the Greece and Rome of ancient times.\nThe evidence for the defence was competent in order to give the opinion of the witnesses as to the merits of the book as a work of art, but in some parts it is made clear that opinions may differ. That would entail a comparison of any evidence that might be adduced in any particular instance and even then the answers on the point would not determine whether a dominant characteristic of the publication was the undue exploitation of sex. That would still have to be determined by the tribunals before which the matter came and in the present case the answers must be in the affirmative.\nThe appeals should be dismissed.\nTaschereau J. (dissenting):\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the reasons written by the Chief Justice and I substantially agree with his reasons, and concur in the conclusions that he has reached. I wish to add only a few personal observations.\nThe original edition of Lady Chatterley's Lover was first published in Italy in 1928. The other editions that were published were expurgated and what was thought to be objectionable was removed from the book. About thirty years later an unexpurgated edition was published, and in November 1959, several copies of this last edition were seized on the strength of a complaint laid under s. 150A of the Criminal Code as amended. His Honour Judge Fontaine of the Court of the Sessions of the Peace sitting in Montreal, ordered these books to be forfeited as being obscene, and the Court of Queen's Bench4 unanimously upheld the decision of the trial judge and dismissed the appeal. The main section of art. 150 of the Criminal Code with which we are concerned is s. 150(8) which was enacted in 1959 and which reads as follows:\n(8) For the purposes of this Act, any publication a dominant characteristic of which is the undue exploitation of sex, or of sex and any one or more of the following subjects, namely, crime, horror, cruelty and violence, shall be deemed to be obscene.\nBefore the enactment of this section the law was far from being clear and left the door open to subtle distinctions, to fine niceties, that too often allowed publishers to continue a wide diffusion of obscene and immoral literature. It is common knowledge that the 1959 amendment was to eliminate the distribution of obscene material and to call a halt to what may be rightly termed legalized assault against morality. The aim of the Act was without doubt to clean up all news stands of this lewd, filthy literature, published surely not to serve the public good but merely for pecuniary gain. I give a cold reception to the suggestion that, if the book is banned, our Courts will be the only ones to hold in such a way. This Court does not make the law but its duty is to apply it as enacted by Parliament. The decisions rendered in England, France and the United States are entirely immaterial for the determination of the case at bar. Our law enacted in 1959 is substantially different, and the decision of R. v. Hicklin5 which was formerly applied in England and Canada is no longer, for the purpose of this case, the law of the land.\nThe question which is to be solved is the following: Do we find that there is in this publication a dominant characteristic which is the undue exploitation of sex? If so, the book is deemed to be obscene. I find it unnecessary to determine whether s. 150(8) is exhaustive or not. It is sufficient, I think, to say that if we find in the book a dominant characteristic which is the undue exploitation of sex, it must be banned. The law says a dominant and not the dominant characteristic. Moreover I believe that, without deciding as to its legality or illegality, too much weight has been attached to the expert evidence which has been adduced. The lawful or unlawful circulation of a book cannot be conditioned by the subjective tastes or propensities of witnesses, whatever may be their literary aptitudes. A more objective legal aspect of the question has to be considered. This book is the story of an upper class Englishman who came back paralyzed from the first world war. He operated his coal mines and occasionally wrote novels particularly noteworthy for their mediocrity. His wife, Constance, is dissatisfied and frustrated. After having refused the suggestion of her husband to have a child with one of his friends, which he would recognize as his own, she meets Mellors, the game keeper, who, in Lawrence's mind, is the archetype of the \"natural man\". He is an offspring of the labour class and is quite intellectually independent. Constance and Mellors then start an intimate relationship, and when she becomes pregnant, she decides to divorce Chatterley and marry the game keeper.\nThe author then minutely describes with unholy satisfaction more than fifteen adulterous scenes in the hen-house, the brush wood of the nearby fields, or the living quarters of the game keeper. Nothing is left even to the most vivid imagination. All the episodes are brutally described, and the conversation between the two lovers is of a low and vulgar character. Words are used that no decent person would dare speak without, in my view, offending the moral sense of anyone who believes in the ordinary standards of decency, self-respect and dignity.\nIt is said on behalf of the book that there are three principal characteristics which distinguish this novel:\n1. That it is an attack on industrialism and its evils in England;\n2. The emphasis on \"blood knowledge\" rather than \"mind knowledge\";\n3. The redeeming power of love when sex is treated as something beautiful and holy.\nIt has also been argued that this novel is placed in a setting which emphasizes its literary qualities and it is praised as a significant work of a major English novelist. I must say that I believe that this book has been over-glorified. Lawrence may have given many fine contributions to English literature; he may have been stamped as a classic of our modern times, but all the beautiful things that he may have written cannot legalize what the law forbids. He has, of course, a great gift for description, for setting forth in words what is the product of his fertile imagination, but all the art he unfolds does not change the nature of \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\". I never thought that the frame could make the picture.\nEven if, as argued, this book were a work of art, I think that art can co-exist with obscenity and does not exclude it. A nudity is not an obscenity. The great museums of the world are filled with paintings of the human body, and it would be a nonsense to hold the view that Rembrandt, Leonardo de Vinci, Michel-Ange, Rapha\u00ebl or Renoir have painted obscenities. There is nothing in those masterpieces which is offensive to modesty or decency, or that expresses or suggests lewd thoughts, as \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" does.\nIt is my view, that if any industrial ills have existed or do exist now in England, and that if there are conflicts between capital and labour, the solution of the problem cannot be found in Lawrence's book. The evidence does not reveal the results obtained by the publication of the book, and there is nothing to indicate that this so-called palliative has even momentarily relieved the ills that Lawrence thought affected the British Isles. In order to improve the social conditions in England, if they have to be improved, I have more faith and hope in sound legislation enacted by Parliament, than in the adulterous scenes described by Lawrence in his book.\nWhether the emphasis should be placed on \"blood knowledge\" or \"mind knowledge\", in order to purify the social atmosphere of England, or whether sex should be treated as something beautiful and holy in order to become the redeeming power of love, are ideologies that may possibly be the guides of future generations. The diffusion of these patriotic ideas, cherished by Lawrence, are surely not forbidden by law. What in my view is objectionable, is not the aim pursued by the author, although I find it an illusory promise of future happiness, but the means employed for the demonstration of his thesis.\nHe relies on sex and adultery to dissolve the clouds of social evils that he believes are hanging over the skies of England. In doing so, he violates, I think, s. 150(8) of the Criminal Code, and I am convinced that we must necessarily find in the book \"an undue exploitation of sex\", which is \"a dominant\" characteristic of the work. \"Undue\" in the ordinary English language means of course \"unreasonable\", \"unjustifiable\". It conveys the idea that what is said goes beyond what is appropriate or necessary to prove the proposition that one endeavours to demonstrate to the public. I know of no one capable of finding words or imagining scenes that could be added to this publication to make it more obscene. Over three-quarters of the book, or 250 pages deal with filthy, obscene descriptions that are offensive to decency, and entirely unnecessary for what we have been told is the purpose of the book. Nobody would seriously think that this novel could be shown on television or that any respectable publisher would make available to the public in a newspaper or a magazine the complete story of \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\", without shocking the feelings of normal citizens. I am not aware that obscenity is, under the law, the exclusive prerogative of novelists, whatever may be their outstanding talent.\nI have no hesitation in reaching the conclusion that the book comes clearly within the ban of the Act, and that the three appeals should be dismissed.\nLocke J. (dissenting):\u2014In my opinion this book is an obscene publication, as that term is defined in subs. (8) of s. 150 of the Criminal Code.\nI would, therefore, dismiss these appeals.\nCartwright J.:\u2014The course of the proceedings in the courts below is set out in the reasons of other members of the Court.\nIn opening the appeals in this Court counsel for the appellants submitted that subs. (8) of s. 150 of the Criminal Code now contains an exhaustive definition of the word \"obscene\" for all purposes of the Criminal Code and that a publication cannot be held to be obscene unless it falls within the terms of that subsection. Counsel for the Crown in answer to a question from the bench stated that he agreed with this submission and consequently counsel for the appellants was not required to deal further with it in reply.\nThe orders of forfeiture made by the learned Judge of first instance are analogous to convictions of a criminal offence and I do not think that this Court should inquire whether those orders might be supported on a view of the law which counsel for the Crown expressly disclaimed. We should, I think, dispose of the appeals on the basis upon which they were presented to us by all counsel and treat the definition of the word \"obscene\" contained in s. 150(8) as exhaustive. I wish, however, to reserve my opinion as to the true construction of that subsection in case it should be called in question in the future.\nOn the assumption that the definition is exhaustive, for the reasons given by my brother Judson I agree with his conclusion that the book in question is not obscene.\nI would dispose of the appeals as proposed by my brother Judson.\nFauteux J. (dissenting):\u2014This appeal calls for the determination of two questions. The first, one of law, being what constitutes an obscene publication under the Criminal Code of Canada and the other, one of fact, whether the publication here impeached is obscene under the Code.\nUntil at least the 1959 amendments, hereafter considered, the Criminal Code did not give any definition of \"obscenity\" and for nearly a hundred years, from 1868 to 1959, the Canadian Courts, following the Courts in England, have been guided by the rule laid down in R. v. Hicklin6. On this century-old case, the test of obscenity is \"whether the tendency of the matter charged with obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall.\" R. v. Stroll7; R. v. National News8; and R. v. American News9 are, prior to 1959, the more recent applications of this test by the Canadian Courts.\nIn 1959, the provisions of the Criminal Code, appearing under the sub-heading \"Offences Tending to Corrupt Morals\", were amended by 7-8 Elizabeth II, c. 41, by the addition of subs. (8) to s. 150 and the further addition of a new section, namely, 150A, providing the latter, as is the case under the English law, a preventive measure forestalling the dissemination of obscene publications. While the proceedings leading to this appeal are taken under the preventive provisions, the substantive law as to obscenity appears in s. 150 which, as amended and applicable to this case, reads as follows:\n150. (1) Every one commits an offence who\n(a) makes, prints, publishes, distributes, circulates, or has in his possession for the purpose of publication, distribution or circulation any obscene written matter, picture, model, phonograph record or other thing whatsoever, or\n(b) makes, prints, publishes, distributes, sells or has in his possession for the purpose of publication, distribution or circulation, a crime comic.\n(2) Every one commits an offence who knowingly, without lawful justification or excuse,\n(a) sells, exposes to public view or has in his possession for such a purpose any obscene written matter, picture, model, phonograph record or other thing whatsoever,\n(b) publicly exhibits a disgusting object or an indecent show,\n(c) offers to sell, advertises, publishes an advertisement of, or has for sale or disposal any means, instructions, medicine, drug or article intended or represented as a method of preventing conception or causing abortion or miscarriage, or\n(d) advertises or publishes an advertisement of any means, instructions, medicine, drug or article intended or represented as a method for restoring sexual virility or curing venereal diseases or diseases of the generative organs.\n(3) No person shall be convicted of an offence under this section if he establishes that the public good was served by the acts that are alleged to constitute the offence and that the acts alleged did not extend beyond what served the public good.\n(4) For the purposes of this section it is a question of law whether an act served the public good and whether there is evidence that the act alleged went beyond what served the public good, but it is a question of fact whether the acts did or did not extend beyond what served the public good.\n(5) For the purposes of this section the motives of an accused are irrelevant.\n(6) Where an accused is charged with an offence under subsection (1) the fact that the accused was ignorant of the nature or presence of the matter, picture, model, phonograph record, crime comic or other thing by means of or in relation to which the offence was committed is not a defence to the charge.\n(7) In this section, \"crime comic\" means a magazine, periodical or book that exclusively or substantially comprises matter depicting pictorially\n(a) the commission of crimes, real or fictitious, or\n(b) events connected with the commission of crimes, real or fictitious, whether occurring before or after the commission of the crime.\n(8) For the purposes of this Act, any publication a dominant characteristic of which is the undue exploitation of sex, or of sex and any one or more of the following subjects, namely, crime, horror, cruelty and violence, shall be deemed to be obscene. The primary question to be determined as to the law is whether, as contended for on behalf of appellants and conceded by Crown counsel in answer to a question from the Bench, the provisions of subs. (8) purport to be a definition and an exhaustive definition of obscene publication. If this be the case, henceforth the Hicklin test and all the Canadian and English jurisprudence thereunder are rendered obsolete and subs. (8) becomes the only remaining provision where the constituent elements of obscene publication may possibly be found and determined. With deference, I may immediately say that I do not think this Court should rest the decision of a question of law on an admission of counsel. This is specially so in a case where, as here, the particular question assumes in this Court, as it did in the Courts below, a primary influence in the disposition of the case and where the same question has already been judicially considered and negatively answered by a provincial Court of Appeal. In R. v. Munster10, the five members of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco were unanimously of the opinion that subs. (8) does not purport to be a definition of \"obscenity\" and that matters not included in its provisions may yet become obscene under the Hicklin test.\nThe purport of the various amendments successively made in recent years to the law related to obscenity manifests the well publicized and commonly known intention of Parliament to strike more effectively at the corruption of public morals by obscene publications. Evincing such an intent are particularly the provisions of subs. (8) of the 1959 amendments enacting that:\n(8) For the purposes of this Act, any publication a dominant characteristic of which is the undue exploitation of sex, or of sex and any one or more of the following subjects, namely, crime, horror, cruelty and violence, shall be deemed to be obscene.\nThe true significance of the terms here italicized must of necessity be ascertained.\nGenerally, the predominant characteristic of a publication is accepted as the determining feature of its nature. It is also, in certain jurisdictions, only the predominant characteristic of a publication which is relevant to the determination of the specific question whether or not a publication is obscene. If that was a possible view of the law in this country prior to the enactment of subs. (8), no longer can this view obtain under the Criminal Code of Canada. The expression \"a dominant characteristic\" does not have a meaning equating to that of the expression \"the dominant characteristic\". Henceforth, sufficient it will be that one of the prominent features of a publication be that described in subs. (8) to make it an obscene publication under the Code.\nThe ascertainment of the true meaning of the terms \"undue exploitation of sex\", in the context of the subsection and in the broader context of the whole section, is not free from difficulties. Standing alone, the word \"undue\" and the word \"exploitation\" are thus defined in The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, the first:\nNot appropriate or suitable; improper; unseasonable. Unjustifiable, illegal. Going beyond what is appropriate, warranted or natural; excessive. and the second:\nThe action of turning to account; the action of utilizing for selfish purposes.\nRead together, the first qualifying the second, these words indicate that Parliament recognizes that, within some limits, exploitation of sex in a publication is by no means illegal and never was indeed so considered. Common in literature, moving pictures and other forms of entertainment, and even in commercial publications, exploitation of sex, within or beyond these limits, would entirely be banned by subs. (8) were it not for the presence of the word \"undue\" in the provision. The word \"undue\" is thus effective and given full scope if the prevention of such a result is truly the intended purpose and purport of the word. That this may well be its true significance is suggested by its otherwise unbounded vagueness and consequential ineffectiveness to indicate per se with any degree of the certainty required in criminal matters, the limits beyond which exploitation of sex in a publication is prohibited. On this view, \"undue\" is synonymous to \"illegal\", one of the dictionary meanings ascribed thereto, and one then must and only has to refer to the other provisions of s. 150, which exhaustively states the substantive law of obscenity, to ascertain the limits beyond which exploitation of sex in a publication becomes illegal. Thus construed, the subsection still has scope to bar the defence based on the contention that only the predominant characteristic of a publication is to be considered and has also scope to import in the concept of obscenity new subjects, namely, \"crime, horror, cruelty and violence\". On this construction, exploitation of sex is illegal or undue if it has a, tendency to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall, unless it is shown (i) that the public good is served by the publication and (ii) that the exploitation of sex does not extend beyond what serves the public good.\nAnother view of the matter, with which I am in agreement, is that the enactment of subs. (8) is effective to expand the meaning of \"obscenity\" so as to include a publication a dominant characteristic of which is exploitation of sex, if, having regard to the existing standards of decency in the community, such an exploitation is shocking and disgusting, though not necessarily shown to have the tendency to corrupt or deprave.\nI am unable, however, to accept the submission made on behalf of appellants that subs. (8) purports to be an exhaustive definition of an obscene publication. The merit of this contention is conditioned by the true significance, in the context, of the words \"shall be deemed to be obscene\". The expression \"shall be deemed to be\" does not necessarily purport to define. The word \"deemed\" is not inflexible. In R. v. Norfolk County Council11, Cave J. said at page 380:\nGenerally speaking, when you talk of a thing being deemed to be something, you do not mean to say that it is that which it is to be deemed to be. It is rather an admission that it is not what it is to be deemed to be, and that, notwithstanding it is not that particular thing, nevertheless \u2026. it is to be deemed to be that thing.\nOur Criminal Code offers many illustrations of a like significance being given by Parliament to the word \"deemed\" or the expression \"shall be deemed\". One example will suffice. A person who, with intent to commit an indictable offence, obtains entrance in a building by threat or artifice or by collusion with a person within, does not, in any sense, break and enter. Yet, by force of a legal fiction introduced in s. 294(b)(i), a person entering a building by either one of the means therein mentioned, \"shall be deemed to have broken and entered\" for the purposes of s. 292. It has never been nor can it be suggested that these provisions of s. 294 purport to define breaking and entering in the true sense or in a manner excluding the ordinary meaning attending breaking and entering under s. 292; they simply provide that entrance in either one of the circumstances above shall be considered to be breaking and entering. Likewise, Parliament in enacting the provisions of subs. (8), for the purposes of criminal law, resorted to a legal fiction by the force of which (i) the nature of a publication is no longer to be determined exclusively by its predominant characteristic, and (ii) subjects hitherto foreign to the colloquial or legal meaning of obscenity, namely, \"crime, horror, cruelty and violence\", are henceforth, when associated with sex, made subjects relevant to the legal concept of obscenity as related to publication. Clearly, with respect to these new matters, the expression \"shall be deemed\" has a like significance to the one attending the same expression in s. 294 Cr. . Qualifying as it does the whole and only phrase of the subsection, under no rule of construction can this expression be held to have one significance with respect to some of and another with respect to the other matters dealt with in the provision. I find it impossible to hold that Parliament intended, by this enactment, to put beyond the reach of the law a publication having, because of exploitation of sex, the tendency described under the Hicklin test. In my respectful opinion, the subsection does not, either in expressed terms or by clear implication, evince any intention of Parliament to alter the century-old law of obscenity\u2014with which Parliament is presumed to have been acquainted at the time of the enactment\u2014otherwise than by specifically adding thereto that when the particular circumstances described in this amendment are present in a publication, such publication \"shall be deemed to be obscene\".\nFor all these reasons, I would say that, while subs. (8) is effective to expand the law of obscenity, it does not purport to be a definition of obscenity excluding the definition of the Hicklin test and all the Canadian and English jurisprudence in application of that case.\nIn the consideration of the book here impeached, one is naturally conscious that criminal law is not meant to operate in the abstract field of speculation but in the field of concrete factual realities. One is also particularly-reminded that, as stated by Lord Goddard C.J. in Reiter, Carter, Gaywood Press Limited et al.12:\nWhen it is being considered whether books have a tendency to deprave and corrupt, naturally every body's mind turns to the depraving and corrupting of young people into whose hands they may fall.\nAllured by the conspicuous indication on the cover of this book that the particular edition thereof is unexpurgated, juveniles buying pocket-books thus advertised\u2014it is not unreasonable to think\u2014have a dim interest in the literary merits, motives or purposes of the writer. Whether the reading of this book will have upon them or other classes of juveniles the tendency to deprave or corrupt them cannot be determined by the minute process of analysis which experts in the art of literature may adopt to lift out of the book the motives, purposes and literary qualities of its author. An ultimate consideration of substance is the impact which the reading of this book may exert upon their mind and whether depravation and corruption, against which Parliament intends to protect them, may ensue therefrom. This edition of the book contains no less than fifteen pornographic and adulterous episodes which decency has always forbidden ministerial or judicial officers to recite textually in the written opinion they gave as to its character. This edition is accurately described in the following excerpt from the interdiction pronounced in respect thereto by the United States Postmaster-General:\nThe book is replete with descriptions in minute detail of sexual acts engaged in or discussed by the book's principal characters. These descriptions utilize filthy, offensive and degrading words and terms. Any literary merit the book may have is far outweighed by the pornographic and smutty passages and words, so that the book, taken as a whole, is an obscene and filthy work.\nWhether admissible or not, expert evidence, so much relied on by appellants, as to the literary merit of Lawrence's works, is clearly ineffective to change this view of the book. The unexpurgated edition speaks for itself. While, generally, evidence of experts in literature is relevant to the literary merit of a publication, it has been excluded under the Hicklin jurisprudence as irrelevant to the question whether a publication has a tendency to deprave or corrupt. There does not appear to be any valid reason why this rule should vary with respect to the question whether, having regard to the existing standards of decency in the community, the exploitation of sex, which is here a dominant characteristic of the publication, has been carried to a shocking and disgusting point. Whatever be the outstanding position held by Lawrence as a writer, this book offers no evidence that an expert in literature necessarily qualifies, for that reason, as a custos mores.\nWhether one applies the law as it stood prior to or as expanded by the 1959 amendments, I am in respectful agreement with the unanimous conclusion reached in the two Courts below that this unexpurgated edition of Lady Chatterley's Lover is an obscene publication under the Criminal Code of Canada.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nThe judgment of Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJudson J.:\u2014The proceedings against this book, Lady Chatterley's Lover, by D. H. Lawrence, were taken under s. 150A of the Criminal Code enacted in 1959. A Judge, on an information laid by a police officer, issued a warrant of seizure for copies of the book on certain premises and then issued a summons to the occupiers requiring them to appear before the Court and show cause why the matter seized should not be forfeited to Her Majesty. The owners of the premises appeared at the trial to show cause in the Court of Sessions of the Peace for the District of Montreal. This Court, on June 10, 1960, declared that the publication was obscene and made an order directing the forfeiture of the seized copies in accordance with s. 150A, subs. (4), of the Code. This judgment was unanimously affirmed on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench13 on April 7, 1961. On May 29, 1961, this Court granted leave to appeal and declared that the leave was granted at large.\nIn 1959 a new definition of \"obscenity' was introduced into the Criminal Code of Canada by the enactment of subs. (8) of s. 150. This reads:\nFor the purposes of this Act, any publication a dominant characteristic of which is the undue exploitation of sex, or of sex and any one or more of the following subjects, namely, crime, horror, cruelty, and violence, shall be deemed to be obscene. This section is before this Court for the first time. It is enacted for the purposes of the Act not merely for the purposes of the section in which it appears, which is s. 150. It applies to proceedings for the seizure of a book under s. 150A and, in my opinion, in which I am in agreement with Casey J. in the Court of Queen's Bench, it precludes the application of any other test and specifically the one that had been applied in R. v. Hicklin14, and followed in R. v. American News15; R. v. National News16; and R. v. Stroll17. The Hicklin test was \"whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall.\" All the jurisprudence under the Hicklin definition is rendered obsolete by the enactment of the new and exclusive definition of obscenity contained in subs. (8) of s. 150. Under this definition it must be found that all four elements of obscenity are present before there can be a condemnation of the book. There must be a characteristic which is dominant and this dominant characteristic must amount to an exploitation of sex which is undue. If any of these elements is missing, the charge fails.\nThe matter is, of course, one of great importance. A writer who faces a charge of obscenity is entitled to know by what standard his work is to be judged and what defence, if any, he is called upon to make. Under the Criminal Code, as amended in 1959, there is no double standard, that is to say (1) the statutory definition intended to strike down the obvious, and (2), the Hicklin test still in the background, although unstated in the Code, for those works that are not within the statutory definition. If there is to be a double standard, it must be expressly set out in the Code and I would disapprove of R. v. Munster18, where, in sending the case back for a new trial, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco held that there was error when the magistrate directed himself exclusively according to s. 158(8) on the ground that the subsection does not purport to be a definition of what is obscene and because matter not included with its provisions may be obscene under the Hicklin test. If a result such as this is to be brought about the legislation must define the two standards of obscenity and tell the Court that the charge is proved if the work offends either standard. I note that this is the way that the New Zealand legislation is framed, Re Lolita19, and also the Australian legislation, although not so clearly, as considered in Wavish v. Associated Newspapers Ltd.20; MacKay v. Gordon & Gotch (Australasia) Ltd.21; and Kyte-Powell v. Heinemann Ltd.22. Otherwise, why define obscenity for the purposes of the Act, if it is still permissible for the Court to take a definition of the crime formulated 100 years ago and one that has proved to be vague, difficult and unsatisfactory to apply?\nIn contrast, I think that the new statutory definition does give the Court an opportunity to apply tests which have some certainty of meaning and are capable of objective application and which do not so much depend as before upon the idiosyncrasies and sensitivities of the tribunal of fact, whether judge or jury. We are now concerned with a Canadian statute which is exclusive of all others.\nThe inquiry then must begin with a search for a dominant characteristic of the book. The book may have other dominant characteristics. It is only necessary to prove that the undue exploitation of sex is a dominant characteristic. Such an inquiry necessarily involves a reading of the whole book with the passages and words to which objection is taken read in the context of the whole book. Of that now there can be no doubt. No reader can find a dominant characteristic on a consideration of isolated passages and isolated words. Under this definition the book now must be taken as a whole. It is not the particular passages and words in a certain context that are before the Court for judgment but the book as a complete work. The question is whether the book as a whole is obscene not whether certain passages and certain words, part of a larger work, are obscene.\nA search for a dominant characteristic of the book also involves an inquiry into the purpose of the author. What was he trying to do, actually doing, and intending to do? Had he a serious literary purpose or was his purpose one of base exploitation? There is no doubt that English jurisprudence has rejected under the Hicklin test any evidence that the author or others may wish to give of a book's literary or artistic merit as distinct from scientific value. One cannot ascertain a dominant characteristic of a book without an examination of its literary or artistic merit and this, in my opinion, renders admissible the evidence of the author and others on this point. Evidence concerning literary and artistic merit has been excluded in England on the ground of irrelevancy and a supposed rule excluding evidence of opinion on the very fact which is before the Court for decision. Wigmore's opinion is that there never was any basis for such a general rule (3rd ed., s. 1921).\nThe test of the admissibility of this kind of opinion evidence under the present definition in the Code must be whether it is relevant to the determination of a dominant characteristic in the book. I can well understand that some judges and juries might think that such evidence would not help them to a decision and that others might be of the opposite opinion. I would join the second group. I can read and understand but at the same time I recognize that my training and experience have been, not in literature, but in law and I readily acknowledge that the evidence of the witnesses who gave evidence in this case is of real assistance to me in reaching a conclusion.\nThe evidence in this case is all one way. The Crown rested its case on the mere production of the book. Oral evidence was given by Mr. Hugh MacLennan and Mr. Morley Callaghan on the literary and artistic merit of the book and the position of Lawrence in the world of English literature. A third witness who gave oral evidence was Mr. Harry T. Moore, a teacher and critic. Many reviews were also filed written by outstanding literary critics in the United States. There is real unanimity in their opinions that the book is a true and sincere representation of an aspect of life as it appeared to the author. No objection was taken to the admissibility of this evidence. The Crown asked for two or three adjournments for the purpose of refuting it but produced no such evidence. It was then that objection was taken to its admissibility. Even if objection had been taken at the time of its tender, I would hold that it was admissible for the purposes that I have stated. Lawrence had certain opinions about the organization of modern industrial society and its effect upon the relations between man and woman. He chose to express these opinions in a work of imagination, written about an adulterous relationship between the wife of an impotent man of property and that man's servant. Whether his choice of medium was a good choice for the preaching of his ideas and whether the ideas themselves were foolish and wrong-headed are matters upon which there may be a difference of opinion. But a theme of adultery, and what to some readers\u2014and there must be many of these\u2014appears to be a stilted assertion that there exists an important connection between the organization of an industrial society and the sexual relations between man and woman, do not, in themselves, give the book a dominant characteristic condemned by the section of the Code.\nThis novel is a complex piece of writing. It is, in part, but only in part, the story of the development of the relationship between the man and the woman and an outspoken description of their sexual relations. This could be described as a dominant characteristic of the book although such a description could be criticized as an over-simplification. The objectionable characteristic is, of course, to be found in the explicit description and the four letter words. With these qualities, the question is, as I have already stated, whether the book as a whole has a dominant characteristic of undue exploitation of sex.\nThe phrase \"undue exploitation\" suggests, at first sight, an element of tautology but I do not think that this is a sound view. There is a difference between a statute which condemns a book a dominant characteristic of which is the exploitation of sex and one which condemns the undue exploitation of the theme. The use of the word \"undue\" recognizes that some exploitation of the theme is of common occurrence. What I think is aimed at is excessive emphasis on the theme for a base purpose. But I do not think that there is undue exploitation if there is no more emphasis on the theme than is required in the serious treatment of the theme of a novel with honesty and uprightness. That the work under attack is a serious work of fiction is to me beyond question. It has none of the characteristics that are often described in judgments dealing with obscenity\u2014dirt for dirt's sake, the leer of the sensualist, depravity in the mind of an author with an obsession for dirt, pornography, an appeal to a prurient interest, etc. The section recognizes that the serious-minded author must have freedom in the production of a work of genuine artistic and literary merit and the quality of the work, as the witnesses point out and common sense indicates, must have real relevance in determining not only a dominant characteristic but also whether there is undue exploitation. I agree with the submission of counsel for the appellant that measured by the internal necessities of the novel itself, there is no undue exploitation.\nCounsel for the appellant also submits that if \"undueness\" is to be measured by the usages of contemporary novelists and writers, then this book cannot be condemned. Mr. Callaghan and Mr. MacLennan both gave evidence on this point, which is really directed to standards of acceptance prevailing in the community. No matter what form of words may be used, I doubt whether any tribunal, whether judge or jury, can get very far in an obscenity case without being influenced, either consciously or unconsciously, by considerations such as these. The only judicial examination of \"undue exploitation\" or \"undue emphasis\" that I have found is in Australia and New Zealand. As I have already stated the New Zealand legislation begins by telling the court what matters are to be taken into consideration in determining whether a publication is indecent. Then four standards are set out, some of which undoubtedly suggest the Hicklin test. Finally, the next section says: \"Subject to the provisions of the last preceding section any document or matter which unduly emphasizes matters of sex, horror, crime, cruelty or violence shall be deemed to be indecent within the meaning of this Act.\"\nThe first consideration of \"undue emphasis\" appears in the judgment of Fullagar J. in R. v. Close23. To me it is very impressive. He said at p. 465:\nThere does exist in any community at all times\u2014however the standard may vary from time to time\u2014a general instinctive sense of what is decent and what is indecent, of what is clean and what is dirty, and when the distinction has to be drawn, I do not know that today there is any better tribunal than a jury to draw it. \u2026 I am very far from attempting to lay down a model direction, but a judge might perhaps, in the case of a novel, say something like this: \"It would not be true to say that any publication dealing with sexual relations is obscene. The relations of the sexes are, of course, legitimate matters for discussion everywhere. \u2026 There are certain standards of decency which prevail in the community, and you are really called upon to try this case because you are regarded as representing, and capable of justly applying, those standards. What is obscene is something which offends against those standards.\"\nOffence against the standards of the community as a test of \"undueness\" as outlined by Fullagar J. seems to have been accepted in subsequent cases in Australia and New Zealand although it has not been considered by the High Court of Australia. The principle has not escaped criticism as judicial legislation (24 Mod. L.R. 768). I am not satisfied that the criticism is altogether valid. Surely the choice of courses is clear-cut. Either the judge instructs himself or the jury that undueness is to be measured by his or their personal opinion\u2014and even that must be subject to some influence from contemporary standards\u2014or the instruction must be that the tribunal of fact should consciously attempt to apply these standards. Of the two, I think that the second is the better choice.\nBut no matter whether the question of \"undue exploitation\" is to be measured by the internal necessities of the novel itself or by offence against community standards, my opinion is firm that this novel does not offend. I would allow the appeals and dismiss the charge and direct that the seized copies of the book be returned to their owners.\nRitchie J.:\u2014The course of these proceedings in the Courts below is set out in the reasons of other members of the Court and the relevant sections of the Criminal Code are reproduced in full in the reasons of the Chief Justice so that it would be superfluous for me to reiterate them.\nWhile I agree that this appeal should be disposed of in the manner proposed by my brother Judson, I do not share his opinion that the language of s. 150(8) constitutes an exclusive definition of \"obscenity\" for the purposes of the Criminal Code and in spite of the fact that Crown counsel argued the appeal on this basis I find it necessary to express the contrary view. In finding this publication to be obscene, the learned trial judge did not consider himself to be confined to the test of obscenity provided by s. 150(8) and felt free to consider also the standard set by Cockburn C.J. in R. v. Hicklin24, when he said:\n\u2026 the test of obscenity is this, whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall\nWhile affirming the decision at trial, Mr. Justice Casey in the Court of Queen's Bench25 stated himself to be convinced of the soundness of the appellants' argument to the effect that the provisions of s. 150(8) exclude all other tests of obscenity formerly used, and, as has been indicated, it was on this basis that the present appeal was argued by counsel for both parties before this Court.\nSection 150(8) provides that:\nFor the purposes of this Act, any publication a dominant characteristic of which is the undue exploitation of sex, or of sex and any one or more of the following subjects, namely, crime, horror, cruelty and violence, shall be deemed to be obscene.\nWith the greatest respect for those who hold a different view, I am unable to construe the language of this section as meaning that no publication can be obscene for the purpose of the Criminal Code unless it has undue exploitation of sex as a dominant characteristic. On the contrary, I share the opinion expressed by Ilsley C.J. in R. v. Munster26, when he said of this section at p. 159: \"It does not purport to be a definition of 'obscene'. Matter not included in its provisions may be obscene.\"\nThe words \"shall be deemed\" have a variable meaning depending upon the context in which they occur, but although they are employed in more than thirty separate instances in the Criminal Code and are used in many other statutes, I have been unable to find any case holding that when it is provided that a given set of circumstances \"shall be deemed\" for the purposes of the Act in question to fall into a certain category, Parliament is to be taken to have intended to exclude from that category all circumstances which would otherwise have been included in it. In the Criminal Code the expression \"shall be deemed\" is frequently used to extend the meaning of a word or phrase so that it is to be treated for the purposes of the Act or a section of the Act as connoting matters which would not otherwise necessarily be considered as coming within its ordinary and accepted meaning (e.g., ss. 3(2), 5A(4), 38(2), 41(2), 42(3), 269(5), 294(b) and 371(1) and as to the extension of territorial jurisdiction, s. 419). In my view, it is in this sense that the expression is used in s. 150(8).\nSections 150 and 150A are found in Part IV of the Criminal Code which bears the heading \"SEXUAL OFFENCES, PUBLIC MORALS AND DISORDERLY CONDUCT\" and the sub-heading directly preceding s. 150 reads \"OFFENCES TENDING TO CORRUPT MORALS\". These headings afford some indication of the fact that this legislation was initially enacted for the purpose of protecting society against the corruption of public morals by the publication of obscene material, and before the enactment of s. 150(8) the Hicklin test was widely accepted as the only yardstick by which obscenity was to be measured. But corruption of morals is only one harmful aspect of the publication of obscene material, and the Hicklin test leaves out of account publications which are obscene in the sense of being offensive and shocking to the community standards of decency unless they can also be said to have a tendency to deprave and corrupt. Under that test Stable J. in my opinion correctly instructed the jury in R. v. Martin Secker Warburg, Limited27, when he said:\nThe charge is not that the tendency of the book is either to shock or to disgust. That is not a criminal offence. The charge is that the tendency of the book is to corrupt and deprave.\nIn my opinion the enactment of s. 150(8) had the effect of expanding the meaning of \"obscene\" for the purposes of the Criminal Code to include all publications which have undue exploitation of sex as a dominant characteristic whether or not they can be shown to have a tendency to corrupt and deprave and thus of protecting the public against the shocking and disgusting in addition to the depraving and corrupting aspects of obscenity. In my view it is in this sense that the word \"undue\" is employed in s. 150(8) and it carries the meaning of \"undue having regard to the existing standards of decency in the community.\" I do not think that this Court is bound by, nor would I follow, those authorities which have tended to construe the Hicklin definition as meaning that literature available to the community is to be limited by the standard of what is considered to be suitable reading material for adolescents, but I do think that in discharging his duty under s. 150A if a judge is satisfied that the publication before him is likely to have a lowering effect on the moral fibre of adolescent boys and girls or of any other significant segment of the community he would be justified in declaring such a publication to be \"obscene\" even if it did not contain all the ingredients specified in s. 150(8). On the other hand, if the judge is satisfied that the publication contains all those ingredients, that is an end of the matter as far as he is concerned and he must make an order \"declaring it to be forfeited to Her Majesty in the Right of the Province in which the proceedings take place.\" (s. 150A(4)).\nUnder s. 150A the burden of deciding whether the publication is likely to corrupt a significant segment of the population and the burden of determining what is or what is not \"undue\" so as to offend community standards is placed upon the judge before whom the publication is brought, and while it is true that his decision in either case must be a subjective one and will of necessity be coloured in some degree by his own predispositions on such questions, this is not a unique position for a judge under our system of law, and under the Criminal Code it is he and he alone who must be \"satisfied that the publication is obscene \u2026.\" if it is to be forfeited. It should be remembered, however, that these sections of the Criminal Code are enacted for the protection of the public and obscenity is not to be determined by the fact that a publication may offend the prude or excite the frustrated; it must be offensive to community standards or be likely to deprave or corrupt a recognizable segment of the public.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Judson that this inquiry necessarily involves the reading and consideration of the publication as a whole and that it is not only relevant but desirable to consider evidence of the opinions of qualified experts as to the artistic and literary qualities of the publication. Having read the publication which is now before us as a whole and having considered the evidence of the experts called for the defence and the extensive, critical and other material having to do with the book which has been filed, I have little doubt that D. H. Lawrence deliberately selected sex as a dominant characteristic of \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" and that one of the chief messages which he sought to convey was that there is nothing shameful or dirty about the natural functions of the body and that the ultimate physical fulfilment of love between the sexes is a thing of tenderness and beauty having no aspects of obscenity or pornography. It may be said with justice that the author has, in several isolated passages, employed language and depicted scenes which, standing alone, unduly exploit sex, but the opinion is widely held by men of high literary qualifications that this book as a whole constitutes an outstanding contribution to 20th-century English literature and the passages to which I refer must be regarded as an integral part of the wider theme. Although sex is a dominant characteristic of the book and although there are isolated passages which, when read alone, unduly exploit sex, it does not appear to me to follow that these passages, read as a part of the whole book, have the effect of making the undue exploitation which they contain a dominant characteristic of the publication so as to bring it within the provisions of s. 150(8) of the Criminal Code. Nor do I think that any significant segment of the population is likely to be depraved or corrupted by reading the book as a whole.\nI agree with counsel for the appellant that the defence of the public good is available under s. 150A and while we are not required to pass judgment on the literary or artistic qualities of the book or its author, it nevertheless seems to me that any harmful effect which these objectionable passages might have upon those who seek them out for separate reading is counterbalanced by the desirability of preserving intact the work of a writer who, according to the only evidence before us, is regarded as a great artist by teachers, authors and critics whose opinion is entitled to respect.\nI would allow these appeals.

Subsequently, a document, admittedly wholly in the handwriting of the deceased, was discovered. In this document, which contained some deletions and alterations, the deceased had stated her wishes respecting the disposal of her property. The trial judge, without giving written reasons, found that the document was not intended by the deceased to be a testamentary instrument. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, by a majority, reversed that judgment and an appeal was then brought to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nOn a consideration of the contents of the document itself and the evidence, the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta was right in holding that the document did contain a deliberate, fixed and final expression as to the disposition of the property of the deceased on her death and that it was a valid holograph will within the meaning of s. 5(b) of The Wills Act, R.S.A. 1955, c. 369. Re Gray; Bennett et al. v. Toronto General Trusts Corp. et al., [1958] S.C.R. 392, applied; Re Snowball, [1941] O.R. 269, referred to.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, reversing a judgment of Primrose J. holding that a certain document was not intended to be a testamentary instrument. Appeal dismissed.\nM. E. Moscovich, Q.C., for the defendants, appellants, A. M. Smith and A. F. Smith.\nD. C. McDonald, for the defendant, appellant, Canada Permanent Trust Co.\nG. E. Trott, for the plaintiffs, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014The question in issue in this appeal is as to whether a document dated April 22, 1953, admittedly wholly in the handwriting of Ann Cameron Smith, deceased, is a valid holograph will. Wills in holograph form are recognized as being valid under s. 5(b) of c. 369, R.S.A. 1955, which provides:\n5. A will is not valid unless it is made in one of the forms hereafter in this section permitted, that is to say, unless\n* * *\n(b) It is a holograph will, wholly in the handwriting of the testator and signed by him, whether made or acknowledged in the presence of any witness or not.\nThe document in question reads as follows:\nApril 22, 1953\nI would like Laura to have this property\u2014house and lots.\nBarbie the money in Continental Canada Permanent Mortgage Co.\nEna $1,000.00 in National Trust\nBill Continental Champion Savings Corporation deposits.\nAllan choice of pictures\nJean lace table cloth\nBarbie Little Chieftan (Lithograph) and other things I designated.\nSandy Bowling Bowls and choice of books.\nDuncan choice of books pictures ornaments and furniture and half war bonds.\nBobby half war bonds\nAllan $2000.00 National Trust\nAlex $X200.00 National Trust Balance in National Trust after those bequests and expenses attended to to be divided among my two nieces and four nephews.\nDuncan Silver tea service and candlesticks.\nPhyllis Gross Smith to choose silver and dishes\nMarjorie Brodie Smith to choose silver and dishes.\nNieces including Phyllis (A.C.) Smith to choose trinkets.\nAnn C. Smith\nLaura\u2014fur coat.\nIn addition to the two places in this document in which the word \"Continental\" has been deleted, there were two other changes which appear on the face of the document. Immediately following the word \"Ena\" it appears that some figure other than \"$1,000.00\" had originally been included and that a portion of the first figure had been scratched out, with the apparent intention thereafter of leaving the figure \"1\". Also, after the word \"Alex\", initially some figure other than \"$200.00\" had appeared and what had been written immediately prior to the figure \"2\" had been obliterated.\nThe learned trial judge, without giving reasons, found that this document was not intended by the deceased to be a testamentary instrument. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, by a majority of two to one, was \"of the firm opinion that the document in question is a holograph will and it contains a deliberate and fixed and final expression as to the disposal of property upon death.\"\nThe deceased, a retired school teacher who resided in Edmonton, died on April 26, 1958. Following her death and a search of her effects, no will had been found and letters of administration were granted to The Canada Permanent Trust Company as attorney for the two brothers of the deceased, Allan Findlay Smith and Alexander Mutchmor Smith, and her sister Laura Frazer Bowman. Another sister of the deceased, Christina Smith (known to the deceased as \"Ena\"), died on September 24, 1958.\nIn September 1959, Barbara Jean Bowman, the daughter of Laura Frazer Bowman, while looking through some letters which had belonged to the father of the deceased and which were in a small cardboard box at Mrs. Bowman's house in Calgary, discovered the document above quoted. Prior to the death of the deceased this box had been located in a cupboard in her bedroom. The letters related to the preparation of a family tree.\nAllan Findlay Smith testified that in April 1958, prior to the funeral of the deceased, he had searched her house for a will and that he had seen there the box containing the letters regarding the family tree. He also saw the box there in December 1958, when he was making an inventory of the contents of the house. He stated that he examined the contents of the box, but did not see the document now in question.\nThe deceased had a strong box which was unlocked. Following her death, it was found to contain various documents of hers, including the title to her house, insurance policies, share certificates and Canadian Government bonds. In it was an envelope, marked with the words \"Last Will and Testament\", which was empty.\nThe requisites required to make a holograph paper a valid holograph will were stated in the judgment of Fauteux J., delivering the judgment of the majority of this Court in Re Gray; Bennett et al. v. Toronto General Trusts Corp. et al.1\nThere is no controversy, either in the reasons for judgment in the Courts below, or between the parties, that under the authorities, a holographic paper is not testamentary unless it contains a deliberate or fixed and final expression of intention as to the disposal of property upon death, and that it is incumbent upon the party setting up the paper as testamentary to show, by the contents of the paper itself or by extrinsic evidence, that the paper is of that character and nature: Whyte et al. v. Pollok, (1882), 7 App. Cas. 400; Godman v. Godman, [1920] P. 261; Theakston v. Marson, (1832), 4 Hag. Ecc. 290, 162 E.R. 1452.\nIn my opinion the contents of the paper in question here do contain the evidence to show the kind of intent to which he refers in this passage. The wording of the document is a statement of the wishes of the deceased respecting the disposal of her property and it is implicit in the document read as a whole that she wished such disposition to be made following her death. In addition, the word \"bequests\", which she used following reference to various dispositions previously mentioned in the document, is a term which is ordinarily applicable to property taken by will (see Re Snowball2). The document does not appoint executors, nor does it refer to the disposition of the residue of the estate. However, so far as the latter point is concerned, it appears from the evidence that the document did dispose of all the assets which the deceased owned at the date it was made and that the only subsequent additional assets which she acquired prior to her death consisted of twenty shares of the capital stock of the Alberta Gas Trunk Line Limited.\nWith respect to the extrinsic evidence, it appears that the deceased retired in 1952 and that in January or February, 1953, she expressed to her niece, Barbara Jean Bowman, her intention to make a will. It also appears from the evidence that the persons named in the document included all of the brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces of the deceased.\nThe appellants Allan Findlay Smith and Alexander Mutchmor Smith contend that the form of the document is not testamentary and they point out that it had words struck out and numbers blotched. They urged that it was not the kind of a document which the deceased, who, the evidence indicated, was a tidy woman, would have intended as a will. Emphasis was also laid on the fact that the document was not placed by the deceased in her strong box with her other documents, but had been left in the cardboard carton.\nAfter considering the contents of the document itself and after examining the evidence, it is my opinion that the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta was right in holding that the document did contain a deliberate, fixed and final expression as to the disposition of the property of the deceased on her death and that it is a valid holograph will.\nI would dismiss the appeal, the costs of the parties involved to be paid out of the estate.\nAppeal dismissed with costs payable out of the estate.\nSolicitors for the defendants, appellants, A.

Co., where the plaintiff\u2019s husband S was employed as plant electrician. In the course of his duties S undertook to connect the machine with an electrical current and in so doing he neglected to ground the equipment. The result of introducing the current through an exposed wire in the switch box was that the ungrounded part of the equipment became highly charged and S was killed when he came in contact with it. The plaintiff, as executrix of her husband\u2019s estate, brought an action for damages under The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 132. The trial judge decided that the negligence on the part of S in failing to ground the equipment before turning on the current and of the defendant in wiring the switch box as it did contributed to the accident, and holding that it was not practicable to determine the respective degrees of fault, he gave judgment in favour of the plaintiff for one-half of the agreed amount of damages. The judgment of the trial judge was approved by the Court of Appeal, and the defendant then appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Martland and Judson JJ.: S was one to whom the defendant owed a duty to take care. Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562, Dominion Natural Gas Co. Ltd. v. Collins & Perkins, [1909] A.C. 640, referred to. There was no apparent reason for any person from the time the machine left the manufacturer to the time of the accident to open and examine the switch box and there was no duty upon S to examine every part of the machine to find possible defects in the manufacture of it. Nor was the deceased\u2019s negligence severable from the fault of the defendant. Great Eastern Oil and Import Co. Ltd. & Oakley v. Frederick E. Best Motor Accessories Co. Ltd., [1962] S.C.R. 118, distinguished. Accordingly, the conclusion arrived at by both Courts below was correct.\nPer Cartwright and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: It is the absence of a reasonable probability that any defects or concealed dangers in his products will be discovered before use by such examination as ought reasonably to be anticipated which gives rise to the duty owed by a manufacturer to the ultimate user who suffers damage as the result of neglect in the manufacture or preparation of such products or as the result of dangerous qualities inherent in them, but where such reasonable probability exists, the subsequent negligence of the ultimate user cannot be coupled with the initial neglect of the manufacturer so as to permit the application of the doctrine of contributory negligence. Here there was a reasonable probability that any defect in the wiring of the machine would be discovered before use by a form of examination (the test afforded by \u201cgrounding\u201d), which ought reasonably to have been anticipated by the defendant. The circumstances were not such as to bring the manufacturer into direct relationship with S, and there was, therefore, no duty owed by the defendant to him. Donoghue v. Stevenson, supra; Grant v.

Appeal dismissed, Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.\nD.A. Keith, Q.C., and C.A. Keith, for the defendant, appellant.\nJ.D. Arnup, Q.C., and J.J. Carthy, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Martland and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014This is an appeal by the defendant, Hobbs Manufacturing Company, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 affirming the judgment of Smily J., after a trial without a jury. The respondent as administratrix of the estate of her husband, John Shields, brought action pursuant to The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 132, for damages for the death of her husband, on May 6, 1959, by electrocution while installing a turret winder used for the winding of plastic. The winder had been sold to Shields\u2019 employer, Monsanto Oakville Limited, by the appellant\u2019s representative, E.V. Larson Company Limited, f.o.b. the appellant\u2019s factory at Worcester, Massachusetts, U.S.A. The Larson Company was a co-defendant but the present respondent did not object to the trial judge dismissing the action as against it without costs. It was agreed that the total amount of damages should be assessed at $30,000.\nWhile evidence was given that the appellant had made a special examination and test inspection of the winder at its plant and had issued a special inspection report certifying as to the proper functioning of the machine, the trial judge found: (1) that there was defective wiring in the winder, because one of the wire \u201cleads\u201d in the switch box, known as a stop and start switch, showed bare copper (instead of being insulated) at the point where it was connected with the switch; (2) that this defect existed at the time the winder was delivered to the Monsanto Company; (3) that it was a defect which would not reasonably be expected to be ascertained or known by that company or by Shields. He also found that Shields, who was a qualified and experienced electrician, should have grounded the machine before proceeding to connect it with Monsanto\u2019s electric power supply, that he should have known the importance of this and that he was negligent in not so doing. He decided that the negligence on the part of Shields and of the appellant contributed to the accident, and, holding that it was not practicable to determine the respective degrees of fault, gave judgment in favour of the respondent for one-half of the agreed amount of damages. The Court of Appeal agreed with the findings of the trial judge.\nCounsel for the appellant contended that the Court of Appeal was in error in deciding that any duty such as is mentioned in Donoghue v. Stevenson[2] rested upon the appellant with respect to Shields. It is well known that the headnote in Donoghue v. Stevenson is not quite correct, and, in any event, in an earlier case, Dominion Natural Gas Co. Ltd. v. Collins and Perkins[3], the liability of the gas company to third parties was upheld by the Privy Council. It is clear that Shields was one to whom the appellant owed a duty to take care. Counsel for the appellant also contended that even assuming negligence on its part the real cause of the accident was the failure of Shields to ground the machine. He relied upon Regulation No. 428(1) made by the Hydro-Electric Power Commission under The Power Commission Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 281:\n428 (1) The exposed non-current-carrying metal parts of fixed electrical equipment shall be grounded where the equipment\n* * *\n(g) operates with any terminal at more than 150 volts to ground.\nHe also argued that as an experienced electrician Shields knew or ought to have known the danger of putting a temporary connection from the machine to the 550-volt power outlet in the Monsanto plant and referred to the type of footwear worn by Shields. The evidence as to the footwear is unsatisfactory but taking it most favourably to the appellant, Shields\u2019 shoes, as described, constituted merely a contributory cause of the accident.\nCounsel for the appellant pointed out that this machine contained what he called a \u201cbuilt-in\u201d system of inspection. By this he meant that if the electrician had properly grounded the machine before turning on the power, the fusebox would have shown that there was a defect in the wiring. The respondent\u2019s answer is that when Shields began to connect this machine to the source of power, he was justified in assuming that it was properly wired and that no inspection to check this fact was necessary; that admitting that Shields was negligent when he connected the machine without first grounding it, that negligence would not have injured him if Shields had not justifiably assumed that he was working on a properly wired machine; that both causes were operating at the time of death\u2014the negligence of the manufacturer and the negligence of the electrician; and that in these circumstances, the trial judge and the Court of Appeal were right in dividing responsibility.\nI agree with the statement of Chief Justice Porter speaking on behalf of the Court of Appeal, that there was no apparent reason for any person from the time that the machine left the manufacturer to the time of the accident to open and examine the box and that there was no duty upon Shields to examine every part of the machine to find possible defects in the manufacture of it. The matter may be put as a paraphrase of what is stated in the 13th edition of Salmond on Torts, p. 569: Whether the appellant should reasonably have expected Shields to use the opportunity for inspection in such a way as to give him warning of the risk.\nThe decision of this Court in Great Eastern Oil and Import Company Limited and Angus Oakley v. Frederick E. Best Motor Accessories Company Limited[4], relied upon by counsel for the appellant, is quite distinguishable as there it was held that the negligence of Oakley, who had been in charge on behalf of the appellant company in making a delivery of gasoline to the premises of the respondent, was clearly severable from any act or omission of the plaintiff, even if such act or omission could be considered a fault. Reference was there made to the discussions that had occurred in the Courts and elsewhere as to proximate cause, causa causans and the last clear chance.\nEach case must be decided upon its own particular facts and in the present appeal I agree with the conclusion arrived at by both Courts below. The appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J. (dissenting):\u2014In the month of March 1959, the appellant, a Massachusetts company engaged in the manufacture of heavy machinery, undertook to supply an electrically-operated heavy duty machine encased in metal for installation by Monsanto Oakville Limited at its plant at Oakville, Ontario, in which province there were then, as there are now, in force regulations made under The Power Commission Act requiring, inter alia, that the exposed non-current-carrying metal parts of fixed electrical equipment shall be grounded where the equipment operates with any terminal at more than 150 volts to ground. (Regulation 428.)\nBefore the machine left the appellant\u2019s plant it was subjected to extensive tests which indicated that it was in safe running order, but it is apparent that owing to the manner in which the appellant had introduced the \u201clead wires\u201d into the \u201cstop and start switch box\u201d attached to the machine, the insulation on one of such wires had worn thin so that by the time of installation at the Monsanto Oakville Limited plant bare copper wire was exposed at the point where it was connected with the switch.\nPursuant to the regulations made under The Power Commission Act, it is provided that an annual permit may be issued to the owner of any manufacturing, mercantile or other building where electrical installation work in connection with the plant is required to be performed, provided that the owner or occupant employs his own electrician for that purpose, and it was for this, amongst other purposes, that Mr. Shields was employed by the Monsanto Company.\nIn the course of his duties Mr. Shields, who was an electrician of great experience, undertook to connect the machine in question which had then been bolted to the factory floor with an electrical current of 550 volts, and in so doing he neglected to ground the equipment although there was apparently ample opportunity to do so. The result of introducing this current through the exposed wire in the switch box was that the ungrounded exposed metal part of the equipment became highly charged and that the unfortunate engineer was killed when he came in contact with it some one-half to one hour after the current had been turned on.\nThis was a machine designed by the manufacturer as being required to be grounded as can be seen by the evidence of the president of Hobbs Manufacturing Company who stated in reference to these products of that company that \u201ca machine must be grounded before it is started up\u201d.\nIt is plain also from the evidence of the plant superintendent of Monsanto Oakville Limited that provision had been made at that company\u2019s plant for the grounding of the machine, and that both he and the plant electrician knew the provisions of Reg. 428 and, therefore, knew that the machine was one which was required to be grounded before use. After agreeing that he was familiar with Reg. 428, the plant superintendent went on to say on cross-examination:\nQ. You are familiar with that regulation. That is regulation 428\u2026 I take it that, as the plant electrician, Mr. Shields, even more than you, would be familiar with such regulation?\nA. Yes. The same witness had given the following evidence on direct examination:\nQ. What type of permanent grounding was contemplated so far as this machine was concerned?\nA. Well, it would have been grounded through conduits when it was put in, when it was finished.\nand he later gave this evidence:\nQ. Was the Hobbs machine actually running at the time of the accident?\nA. No, not to my knowledge, the power was on.\nQ. What would be the purpose of the machine having been on at all?\nA. Well, it was not supposed to have been turned on.\nThe Courts below have found that the death was caused by a combination of the negligence of the appellant in wiring the switch box as it did and the negligence of Shields in failing to ground the equipment before turning on the current, and that as both causes were operating at the time when Shields was killed, and as it is not possible to assess the varying degrees of responsibility, the fault should be equally divided. The respondent and the persons on whose behalf this action was brought were accordingly adjudged entitled to recover $15,000 against the appellant, being one-half of the agreed amount of the damage sustained as a result of the death.\nThe question raised by this appeal is whether, under the circumstances outlined above, the appellant manufacturer owed any duty to Shields giving rise to liability at law.\nChief Justice Porter, speaking on behalf of the Court of Appeal in the present case, stated the crux of the problem in these words:\nDoes then the duty defined in Donoghue v. Stevenson [[1932] A.C. 562] extend to the circumstances before us? Did the manufacturer bring itself into direct relationship with the skilled electrician who was killed as the result of the combined carelessness of the manufacturer and the electrician? If there were no duty, there would be no negligence. The Negligence Act adds nothing to the duty. It merely eliminates contributory negligence as a complete defence, and provides for apportionment of the damages.\nSince the decision in Grant v. Australian Knitting Mills, Ltd.[5], it has been generally accepted that the principle of the decision in Donoghue v. Stevenson, supra, is summed up in the words of Lord Atkin at p. 599 where he said:\n\u2026 a manufacturer of products, which he sells in such a form as to show that he intends them to reach the ultimate consumer in the form in which they left him with no reasonable possibility of intermediate examination, and with the knowledge that the absence of reasonable care in the preparation or putting up of the products will result in an injury to the consumer\u2019s life or property, owes a duty to the consumer to take that reasonable care.\nIn commenting on this passage in the case of Paine v. Colne Valley Electricity Supply Co., Ltd., et al.[6], Lord Goddard observed at pp. 808-9:\nIt seems clear that, in speaking of the prevention, or of the reasonable possibility, of examination, LORD ATKIN meant prevention or no possibility in a business sense. A person who buys 100 cases of tinned salmon from the packers has a physical opportunity of examining each tin. Commercially speaking, it would be impossible for him to do so, nor would anyone expect it, as by opening the tins he would spoil the contents before they could be sold. Perhaps, therefore, without disrespect, the word \u201cprobability\u201d may be substituted for \u201cpossibility\u201d. If there be such a probability, the relationship between manufacturer and ultimate user or consumer will not be proximate. Something is interposed which prevents the forging of a link between the two.\nAlthough London Graving Dock Co. Ltd. v. Horton[7] was a case of an invitor, the following comment made by Lord Porter at p. 750 appears to me to have particular relevance to the present case:\nYour Lordships\u2019 House held that\u2026 the manufacturer would have escaped if it was natural to expect that the intermediate vendor would take care to see that the contents were in order. The pursuer, however, could recover from the manufacturer because such an examination was not to be expected. The law required the latter to be careful not to run the risk of injuring a person whom he contemplates or ought to contemplate as likely to be injured by his negligence, but an examination by the retail vendor, if rightly expected, could be relied upon by the manufacturer and would have been a complete answer to the claim. Still more so would knowledge by the purchaser of the true position, whether such knowledge was actual or such as the circumstances would warrant the manufacturer to assume.\nIt is to be observed that in the case of Woods v. Duncan et al.[8], Lord Simonds made the following general comments:\nBut at this stage the question is whether the assumed negligent actor ought reasonably to have foreseen the intervening act and, having foreseen it, to have provided for it or ignored it at his peril. It is, I think, essentially the same question as that which your Lordships resolved in Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562. For to ask, who is the neighbour to whom I owe a duty in respect of my act, may be in part answered by saying that he at least is not my neighbour who cannot be affected by my act, unless there is some intervening event which I cannot reasonably foresee. And later by the same judge at p. 443 where he says of the Donoghue case:\nThere the manufacturer was held to owe a duty to the consumer just because the intervening act of examination was not reasonably contemplated as possible or probable\u2014I do not pause to consider which. That, I suggest, is one aspect of a wider proposition, namely, that the nature of the duty (if any) owed by an actor to a third party depends upon the existence and nature of the acts which should in the actor\u2019s contemplation be regarded as reasonably likely to intervene.\nIt is the absence of a reasonable probability that any defects or concealed dangers in his products will be discovered before use by such examination as ought reasonably to be anticipated which gives rise to the duty owed by a manufacturer to the ultimate user who suffers damage as the result of neglect in the manufacture or preparation of such products or as the result of dangerous qualities inherent in them, but where such reasonable probability exists, the subsequent negligence of the ultimate user cannot be coupled with the initial neglect of the manufacturer so as to permit the application of the doctrine of contributory negligence. As Porter C.J.O. had so clearly stated, \u201cThe Negligence Act adds nothing to the duty.\u201d\nI do not think that the word \u201cinspection\u201d as used by Lord Atkin in the Donoghue case necessarily connotes \u201cphysical inspection\u201d but rather that it embraces all means by which the defects or dangers might reasonably be expected to be detected before use. In this regard it is to be observed that in Grant v. Australian Knitting Mills, Ltd., supra, when Lord Wright was describing the opaque ginger-beer bottle which gave rise to the litigation in Donoghue\u2019s case, he referred to it as an\n\u2026 article issued to the world, and\u2026 used\u2026 in the state in which it was prepared and issued without it being changed in any way and without there being any warning of or means of detecting the hidden danger. (The italics are mine.)\nNo manufacturer of heavy electrically-operated machinery can, in my opinion, be expected to contemplate the probability that the ultimate user will dismantle a machine and examine every part of it for possible dangers or defects, but if there is a known procedure which will disclose such dangers and defects without physical inspection it becomes a question of whether the manufacturer was justified in assuming it to be reasonably probable that such procedure would be followed in the particular case, or to put it another way, whether the manufacturer ought reasonably to anticipate that the procedure would not be followed. The fact that such a procedure is required to be followed by the law of the place where the machine is to be installed is, in my opinion, a factor to be considered in determining this issue.\nThe regulations made under The Power Commission Act of Ontario, include the following:\n428 (1) The exposed non-current-carrying metal parts of fixed electrical equipment shall be grounded where the equipment\n* * *\n(g) operates with any terminal at more than 150 volts to ground.\nAfter his attention had been called to this regulation, one of the electrical inspectors for the Ontario Hydro who gave evidence on behalf of the plaintiff at this trial gave the following answers on cross-examination:\nQ. And you agree with me that where a machine such as the one in question is connected up to a voltage in excess of 150 volts, it must be grounded?\nA. Yes.\nQ. That is a Hydro requirement, a regulation, is it not?\nA. Right.\nQ. Now, what is the object of grounding?\nA. Well, to make the machine safe in case of a breakdown or a defect.\nQ. To make the machine safe in case of a breakdown or a defect. Now, would that kind of defect include a short circuit induced by a conductor coming in touch with another part of the metal?\nA. I would say yes.\nQ. Such as what you suspect happened in this case?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And the grounding is for the express purpose of making the machine safe in the event of such a defect?\nA. Yes.\nThe same witness later said:\nQ. As you have explained it, so that there can be no doubt about it, the purpose of grounding is to prevent just the thing that happened in this case?\nA. Right.\nQ. Will you go this far with me, that in your best opinion, had this machine been grounded this accident would not have happened.\nA. Yes, I would have to say yes to that.\nThe general application of Reg. 428 to all fixed electrical equipment with exposed non\u2011current-carrying metal parts operating with a terminal at more than 150 volts indicates that the potential danger lurking in all such equipment is recognized by the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario and it does not seem to me to have been unreasonable to assume that both the potential danger and the regulation itself were known to the very competent electrician who had been working for just under 4 years as assistant plant electrician and subsequently plant electrician in a plant where other such electrical equipment was installed and who was effecting the installation under a permit issued under the authority of the same regulations.\nCounsel for the appellant suggested that the machine was so constructed that when properly grounded it contained its own \u201cbuilt-in\u201d system of inspection, and while this is perhaps something of an exaggeration, it is nevertheless apparent that the effect of such grounding on the machine in the condition in which it was at the time of installation would have been to cause a fuse to blow when the power was turned on, thus eliminating the danger and indicating the defect in the wiring of the machine. This, in my opinion, is the equivalent of an \u201cinspection\u201d as that word is employed in Donoghue v. Stevenson, supra.\nThe president of the appellant company described the matter thus:\nQ. Mr. Oakes, assuming that the power supply is correctly connected to the machine by the electrician and the machine grounded through some part of its exterior casing by means of the wire illustrated in Exhibit 18F, and there is a short circuit in the machine, for instance, as is suggested in this case that a bare wire is touching the exterior of the switch box: are you in a position to say what happens when the power is turned on to that machine in that condition?\nA. Well, provided the grounding is a good ground, I would say the fuses would blow in the disconnecting switch or somewhere on the machine.\nQ. That is, a fuse would blow and what does that result in?\nA. Eliminating the power from the machine.\nQ. So that with the blowing of a fuse there is no power, no current in the machine?\nA. That is correct.\nQ. Is there current in any part of the machine?\nA. No, if the\u2014\nQ. Of course, if the fuse which is at the disconnect box blows, there will be no power at any part of the machine?\nA. That is correct.\nQ. And if the fuse happened to be in the type \u201cE\u201d box that blew, what circuit goes out?\nA. The circuit to the switches and to the motor. It is to be remembered that although the manufacturer had adapted the switch box attached to this machine for use in a manner for which it was not originally intended and although that method of adaptation resulted in the insulation wearing off one of the wires in the box after it had been tested at the manufacturer\u2019s plant, the defect was nevertheless one of a character against which the Ontario Hydro Commission had provided protective regulations applicable to all such machines indicating, in my view, a recognition by that Board of the reasonable possibility of such a defect existing in any such machine no matter how carefully it may have been manufactured and tested at the factory.\nIt appears to me that the interpretation placed on Lord Atkin\u2019s decision in Donoghue\u2019s case by the learned editor of the Law Quarterly Review (Dr. A.L. Goodhart) in (1938), 54 L.Q.R. at p. 63 is particularly apposite to the circumstances here disclosed. He there says:\nLord Atkin twice stated that the manufacturer will be liable if the goods sold are to be \u201cused at once before a reasonable opportunity of inspection\u201d. He explained this on the ground that \u201cthis is obviously to exclude the possibility of goods having their condition altered by lapse of time, and to call attention to the proximate relationship, which may be too remote where inspection even of the person using, certainly of an intermediate person, may reasonably be interposed\u201d. What is meant by the two phrases \u201creasonable opportunity of inspection\u201d and inspection which \u201cmay reasonably be interposed\u201d? By what test are we to judge whether the purchaser\u2019s inspection \u201cmay reasonably be interposed\u201d? It is submitted that such an inspection is reasonably interposed when the purchaser, instead of being entitled to rely on the manufacturer\u2019s skill, ought to make an inspection of his own. An opportunity is reasonable not merely because a sufficient length of time has been afforded to the purchaser: it is reasonable because under the circumstances the purchaser ought to make an inspection. (The italics are mine.)\nThe fact that the machine was designed to be grounded, that the plant superintendent and plant electrician knew that it should be grounded, that the regulations required it to be grounded and that grounding before use would have had the effect of isolating the danger and disclosing the defect all indicate to me that it was recognized by all concerned (the manufacturer, the purchaser, the electrician and the Commission) that it was not safe \u201cto rely on the manufacturer\u2019s skill\u201d without \u201cgrounding\u201d this type of machine before using it as it was used in this case. In the same article in 54 L.Q.R. at pp. 66-67, the learned author adopts the test of whether the defect was discoverable by \u201csuch a reasonable examination as ought to be anticipated\u201d as expressing the principle for which he is contending. I agree with this reasoning and consider that the answer to this question is decisive of the present case. In my view, for the reasons which I have stated, the \u201ctest\u201d afforded by \u201cgrounding\u201d constituted \u201creasonable examination\u201d in the present case, and it seems to me that for the reasons hereinbefore set forth the appellant was amply justified in anticipating that it would be carried out as the regulation required and ordinary caution dictated.\nI am, accordingly, of opinion that there was a reasonable probability in this case that any defect in the wiring of the machine would be discovered before use by a form of examination which ought reasonably to have been anticipated by the appellant, or to put the matter in another way, that it was not unreasonable for the appellant to anticipate that the electrician installing this machine would take advantage of the recognized means of protection from and detection of any concealed and undisclosed dangers or defects which such grounding would afford.\nIn view of all the above, I have reached the conclusion that the circumstances here disclosed are not such as to bring the manufacturer into direct relationship with the skilled electrician who was killed, and that there was, therefore, no duty owed by the appellant to the late Mr. Shields.\nI would allow this appeal and direct that judgment be entered dismissing the action with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, CARTWRIGHT and RITCHIE JJ. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Keith, Ganong, Du Vernet & Carruthers, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Mason, Foulds, Arnup, Walter, Weir & Boeckh, Toronto.\n[1] [1962] O.R. 355, 32 D.L.R.

The plaintiff applied for a declaration that it was not under any obligation to furnish the information or produce the documents called for by the requirement and that it was not subject to the penalty provided for failure to comply therewith. By agreement between the parties a special case was stated for the opinion of the Court. It was agreed that the requirement did not relate in any way to the administration or enforcement of the Act in respect to the liability for tax of the plaintiff, and that the information to be furnished to comply with the requirement would include a great deal of private information in respect of the business and affairs of many corporations and individuals, some resident and some not resident in Canada. It was admitted that the Minister was acting in good faith, that the requirement related to a genuine and serious inquiry into the tax liability of some specific person or persons and that the Minister had reason to believe that such person or persons was or were among those referred to in the special case. The trial judge gave judgment against the plaintiff; this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, and with leave obtained from that Court the plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau, Abbott and Judson JJ.: The wording of subs. (2) of s. 126 of the Income Tax Act was very broad and comprehensive since the Minister \u201cmay, for any purpose related to the administration or enforcement of this Act,\u201d proceed in the manner indicated. So far as the Union Bank of Switzerland was concerned, if it carried on business in Canada, it was liable to tax under the Act and it was part of the administration or enforcement of the Act to discover if the Union Bank was subject to taxation.\nThe wording of the subsection was in such general terms that it could not be restricted to information as to the tax liability of the plaintiff itself. The fact that the information sought would disclose private transactions in which a number of persons were involved who were not under investigation and might not be liable to tax, did not affect the Minister\u2019s power. Nor could the power be restricted to an inquiry for definite and limited particular information.\nPer Locke, Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: The purpose of the Minister\u2019s requirement was to obtain information relevant to the tax liability of some specific person or persons whose liability to tax was under investigation; this was a purpose related to the administration or enforcement of the Act.\nOn the question whether the test to be applied in determining the validity of a requirement is subjective or objective, here the condition was objective, and the question whether the Minister was acting for the purpose specified in the Act was subject to review, even though he might be acting in an administrative capacity. The question involved an interpretation of the Act and its application to the circumstances disclosed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming a judgment of Morand J. Appeal dismissed.\nHon. R.L. Kellock, Q.C., and J.B. Tinker, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nD. Guthrie, Q.C., and J.D. Lambert, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau, Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014By leave of the Court of Appeal for Ontario the Canadian Bank of Commerce appeals from a judgment of that Court1 affirming the order of Morand J. That order answered the question asked in the special case in the negative; directed that the appellant furnish the information and produce the documents requested in a certain requirement of the Minister of National Revenue, dated August 17, 1960; and directed that the time for invoking the penalty for failure to comply with the requirement should commence from the date of the order, May 1, 1961.\nThe dispute hinges upon the proper construction of subs. (2) of s. 126 of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148:\n126. (2) The Minister may, for any purpose related to the administration or enforcement of this Act, by registered letter or by a demand served personally, require from any person\n(a) any information or additional information, including a return of income or a supplementary return, or (b) production, or production on oath, of any books, letters, accounts, invoices, statements (financial or otherwise) or other documents,\nwithin such reasonable time as may be stipulated therein.\nThe requirement reads as follows:\nSpecial Investigations Section,\nJ.M. Fell\nDepartment of National Revenue\nCanada\nTaxation Division\nCONFIDENTIAL\nREQUIREMENT FOR INFORMATION AND PRODUCTION\nOF DOCUMENTS\nOttawa, 17th August, 1960.\nThe General Manager,\nThe Canadian Bank of Commerce,\n25 King Street West,\nToronto, Ontario.\nDear Sir,\nThe Union Bank of Switzerland\n1. For purposes related to the administration or enforcement of the Income Tax Act, pursuant to the provisions of Section 126(2) of the said Act, I require from you on or before 19th September, 1960, information and production of documents as follows:\n(a) A statement setting out all entries in all accounts that are known to be or to have been operated or controlled by, for, or on behalf of the persons named above or any of them and all entries that are known to be or to have been related to the affairs of those persons or any of them in all other accounts including Casual, Manager\u2019s, Sundry and similar accounts for the period beginning 1st January 1955 and ending 31st December 1959, both dates inclusive.\n(b) A statement setting out particulars of all transactions, including loans and discounts and collateral thereto, safety deposit box rentals and security dealings with, for, or on behalf of the persons named above or any of them, or any person or persons known to be or to have been acting on behalf of those persons or any of them for the period beginning 1st January 1955 and ending 31st December 1959, both dates inclusive.\n(c) Production of all documents, including authorizations, powers of attorney, mail and telegraphic transfers, accounts, vouchers, letters, contracts, letters of credit and statements that are known to be or to have been related to the entries or transactions set out in the statements required under (a) and (b) above, for the period beginning 1st January 1955 and ending 31st December 1959, both dates inclusive. 2. To comply with this requirement you should forward the information and documents hereby required to the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Taxation, 444 Sussex Drive, Ottawa, Ontario, by registered mail, within the time specified in paragraph 1. Photostatic or certified copies of the documents will be sufficient.\n3. If you so request in your acknowledgment of this requirement, arrangements will be made for an officer of the Taxation Division to attend at your office to receive the information and inspect the documents required. Provision of the information and production of the documents to that officer at the time of his attendance at your office will be considered as compliance with this requirement if your acknowledgment is received on or before 19th September 1960.\n4. Your attention is directed to the penalty provided in subsection 2 of section 131 of the Income Tax Act for default in complying with this requirement.\nYours truly,\n\u201cD. Sheppard\u201d\nAssistant Deputy Minister of\nNational Revenue for Taxation\nREGISTERED\nAlthough there are various references in this requirement to \u201cthe persons named above\u201d, the Union Bank of Switzerland is the only party named, and it is important to emphasize at the outset that from a consideration of the entire document the Union Bank of Switzerland is under investigation. The requirement is signed by the Assistant Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Taxation but it is admitted that under the power conferred upon the Governor in Council by s. 117(1) (f) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148:\n117. (1) The Governor in Council may make regulations\n* * *\n(f) authorizing a designated officer or class of officers to exercise powers or perform duties of the Minister under this Act.\nthe Assistant Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Taxation was authorized by Reg. 900 to exercise all the powers and perform all the duties of the Minister under the Act. It is convenient at this point, because of an argument advanced on behalf of the appellant, to note that under subs. (2) of the same regulation an official holding a position of \u201cDirector-Taxation\u201d in a District Office of the Taxation Division of the Department of National Revenue may exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister under subs. (2) of s. 126 of the Act. On September 15, 1960, the appellant issued a writ of summons in the Supreme Court of Ontario claiming \u201ca declaration that it is not under any obligation to furnish the information or produce the documents relating to the accounts of its customer, The Union Bank of Switzerland, called for by the Requirement for Information and Production of Documents hereinafter described, that the said Requirement is unauthorized and is of no force or effect and that the Plaintiff is not subject to the penalty threatened therein for failure to comply therewith\u201d.\nOn March 15, 1961, the solicitors for the parties agreed upon a special case for the opinion of the Court which is set out in extenso in the reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal. It is sufficient to state that it is thereby agreed that the appellant is a large bank of Canada and a taxpayer under the Income Tax Act of Canada; the requirement does not relate in any way to the administration or enforcement of the Act as respects the liability for tax of the appellant; the Union Bank of Switzerland is one of the major banks in Switzerland and is a customer of the plaintiff; the requirement was duly received by the appellant which had failed to comply in whole or in part with it. The special case also shows that the appellant has numerous branches throughout Canada, twelve in the West Indies, five branches or agencies in the United States and two branches in London, England, and that it would require a great amount of clerical work to comply with the requirement. Paragraph 11 referred to particularly by counsel for the appellant reads as follows:\n11. The information to be gathered together and produced to comply with the said Requirement includes a great deal of private information in respect of the business and affairs of the Union Bank of Switzerland and of many other corporations and individuals, some resident in Canada and some not resident in Canada.\nBefore Morand J. it was admitted that the Minister was acting in good faith and that the requirement relates to a genuine and serious inquiry into the tax liability of some specific person or persons; that the Minister had good reason to believe that such person or persons is or are among those referred to in the special case. The Minister refused to state who the person or persons was or were or to designate the person or persons in any way, shape or form. At the hearing before the Court of Appeal counsel for the bank submitted that certain inferences of fact should be drawn from the special case as follows:\n(a) The Minister is proceeding in good faith in the sense that he honestly believes he is proceeding in accordance with his powers.\n(b) The said Requirement relates to a genuine and serious inquiry into the tax liability of some specific person or persons.\n(c) The Minister has reason to believe that such person or persons under investigation are among those referred to in the Special Case.\n(d) Neither the Union Bank of Switzerland nor many of the persons referred to in the Special Case, para. 11 are among the person or persons under investigation.\nCounsel for the Attorney-General agreed as to (a), (b) and (c) but not as to (d). I, therefore, proceed upon the basis that the first three are in the same position as if they were included in the special case.\nThe argument of counsel for both parties covered a wide field and submitted propositions with which it is unnecessary to deal because, as has already been pointed out, by the very terms of the requirement the Union Bank of Switzerland is under investigation. The wording of subs. (2) of s. 126 of the Income Tax Act is very broad and comprehensive since the Minister \u201cmay, for any purpose related to the administration or enforcement of this Act,\u201d proceed in the manner indicated. Section 2 of the Act enacts:\n2. (1) An income tax shall be paid as hereinafter required upon the taxable income for each taxation year of every person resident in Canada at any time in the year.\n(2) Where a person who is not taxable under subsection (1) for a taxation year\n(a) was employed in Canada at any time in the year, or\n(b) carried on business in Canada at any time in the year,\nan income tax shall be paid as hereinafter required upon his taxable income earned in Canada for the year determined in accordance with Division D.\n(3) The taxable income of a taxpayer for a taxation year is his income for the year minus the deductions permitted by Division C.\nTherefore, so far as the Union Bank of Switzerland is concerned, if it carried on business in Canada, it is liable to tax and it is part of the administration or enforcement of the Act to discover if the Union Bank was subject to taxation.\nThe wording of s. 126(2) is in such general terms that it cannot be restricted, as counsel for the appellant argued, to information as to the tax liability of the appellant itself. He also contended that the words in subs. (2) of s. 126 \u201cincluding a return of income or a supplementary return\u201d indicated that the requirement could only be directed to the question of liability to taxation of the appellant. The words italicized do not restrict the generality of the opening words in subs. (2). Although para. 11 of the special case shows that the information to be gathered together and produced to comply with the requirement includes a great deal of private information in respect of the business and affairs of the Union Bank of Switzerland and of many other corporations and individuals, some resident in Canada and some not resident in Canada, I agree with Chief Justice Porter that the fact that the information sought will disclose private transactions in which a number of persons were involved who are not under investigation and may not be liable to tax, does not affect the power. As the Chief Justice points out, much of the information obtained will turn out to be irrelevant. Neither of these probabilities take the case out of a purpose related to the administration or enforcement of the Act.\nSubsections (1) and (3) of s. 126 provide:\n126. (1) Any person thereunto authorized by the Minister for any purpose related to the administration or enforcement of this Act may, at all reasonable times, enter into any premises or place where any business is carried on or any property is kept or anything is done in connection with any business or any books or records are, or should be, kept pursuant to this Act, and\n(a) audit or examine the books and records and any account, voucher, letter, telegram or other document which relates or may relate to the information that is or should be in the books or records or the amount of tax payable under this Act,\n(b) examine property described by an inventory or any property, process or matter an examination of which may, in his opinion, assist him in determining the accuracy of an inventory or in ascertaining the information that is or should be in the books or records or the amount of any tax payable under this Act,\n(c) require the owner or manager of the property or business and any other person on the premises or place to give him all reasonable assistance with his audit or examination and to answer all proper questions relating to the audit or examination either orally or, if he so requires, in writing, on oath or by statutory declaration and, for that purpose, require the owner or manager to attend at the premises or place with him, and\n(d) if, during the course of an audit or examination, it appears to him that there has been a violation of this Act or a regulation, seize and take away any of the records, books, accounts, vouchers, letters, telegrams and other documents and retain them until they are produced in any court proceedings.\n* * * (3) The Minister may, for any purpose related to the administration or enforcement of this Act, with the approval of a judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada or of a superior or county court, which approval the judge is hereby empowered to give upon ex parte application, authorize in writing any officer of the Department of National Revenue, together with such members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or other peace officers as he calls on to assist him and such other persons as may be named therein, to enter and search, if necessary by force, any building, receptacle or place for documents, books, records, papers or things which may afford evidence as to the violation of any provision of this Act or a regulation and to seize and take away any such documents, books, records, papers or things and retain them until they are produced in any court proceedings.\nCertainly, those powers are stringent as well as the powers contained in s. 126A dealing with a solicitor-client privilege and the powers of a judge of a Superior Court or of the Exchequer Court of Canada but it is unnecessary to determine their exact limits.\nThe power conferred upon the Minister or Assistant Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Taxation cannot be restricted to an inquiry for definite and limited particular information; and the mere fact that by subs. (2) of Reg. 900 an official holding the position of \u201cDirector\u2011Taxation\u201d in a District Office of the Taxation Division of the Department of National Revenue might exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister under subs. (2) of s. 126 does not derogate from the wide powers conferred by this last-mentioned subsection. The cases cited by counsel for the appellant are quite distinguishable and I find it unnecessary to go over them in detail.\nThe final argument was that the Assistant Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Taxation is not authorized to act on his opinion, belief or decision, but must in fact have a purpose related to the administration or enforcement of the Act. I have already expressed the opinion, that, in view of the contents of the special case and the admissions of counsel, the Assistant Deputy Minister was in fact acting for a purpose related to the administration or enforcement of the Act. The decision of the Judicial Committee in Nakkuda Ali v. Jayaratne[2], relied upon by counsel for the appellant, is not applicable. In that case power to cancel a licence was conferred upon the Controller of Textiles where he \u201chas reasonable cause to believe that any dealer is unfit to be allowed to continue as a dealer\u201d. The decision was that the requirement of the regulation there in question that the Controller must have reasonable grounds of belief was insufficient to oblige him to act judicially and that there was nothing else in the context or conditions of his jurisdiction which suggested that he must regulate his action by analogy to judicial rules. It was held that the respondent was not amenable to a mandate in the nature of certiorari in respect of his action under the regulation. Much that followed that holding was obiter and has since given rise to considerable discussion as to its validity.\nThe appeal is dismissed, but counsel for the respondent suggested that a new time should be fixed for invoking the penalty for failure to comply with the requirement, which was dated August 17, 1960, and required the information and production of documents on or before September 19, 1960. The trial judge directed that the time for invoking the penalty should commence from the date of his order, May 1, 1961. During the course of the proceedings there was of course no attempt to proceed by the respondent. It would appear to be reasonable to fix August 1, 1962, as the date for compliance.\nNo order as to costs was made by Morand J., or by the Court of Appeal. The appellant might well have been satisfied that it had done all that it should in appealing to the Court of Appeal, but it applied for and obtained leave from that Court to appeal to this Court. The appellant must pay the costs of this appeal.\nThe judgment of Locke, Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014The course of the proceedings in the Courts below and the relevant portions of the record are set out in the reasons of the Chief Justice.\nI agree that the appeal fails.\nI do not find it necessary to deal with all the arguments which were addressed to us as I have reached the conclusion that on the facts set out in the stated case read with the admissions of counsel as to the inferences which should be drawn therefrom it has been shewn that in addressing the requirement to the appellant the Minister was acting for purposes related to the administration or enforcement of the Income Tax Act. I do not base my judgment on the view that it has been established that the liability to tax of the Union Bank of Switzerland is under investigation, a view which I understood counsel for the respondent to reject; on the record it appears to me that the liability of that bank may or may not be under investigation.\nParagraphs 2 and 11 of the stated case are as follows:\n2. The Requirement mentioned in the Writ of Summons herein does not relate in any way to the administration or enforcement of the Income Tax Act as respects the liability for tax of the plaintiff itself.\n* * *\n11. The information to be gathered together and produced to comply with the said Requirement includes a great deal of private information in respect of the business and affairs of the Union Bank of Switzerland and of many other corporations and individuals, some resident in Canada and some not resident in Canada.\nInferences (b) and (c) which counsel agreed should be drawn are as follows:\n(b) The said Requirement relates to a genuine and serious inquiry into the tax liability of some specific person or persons.\n(c) The Minister has reason to believe that such person or persons under investigation are among those referred to in the Special Case.\nWhen these are read together it appears to be common ground, (i) that the requirement addressed to the appellant relates to a genuine and serious inquiry into the tax liability of some specific person or persons, (ii) that the Minister has reason to believe that such person or persons are among those referred to in the special case, (iii) that the persons referred to in the special case are those mentioned in paragraph 11, \u201cthe Union Bank of Switzerland and many other corporations and individuals some resident in Canada and some not resident in Canada\u201d and (iv) that the answer to the requirement will provide a great deal of private information in respect of the business and affairs of the persons referred to in item (iii) and therefore in respect of the business and affairs of the person or persons into whose liability to tax inquiry is being made.\nI agree with the Chief Justice and with Porter C.J.O. that the circumstance that the answer to the requirement will disclose private transactions involving a number of persons who are not under investigation and may not be liable to tax does not invalidate the requirement. The purpose of the requirement, then, is to obtain information relevant to the tax liability of some specific person or persons whose liability to tax is under investigation; this is a purpose related to the administration or enforcement of the Act. As I have reached the conclusion that the existence of this purpose is established by the material in the record, I do not find it necessary to examine the arguments addressed to us on the question of the incidence of the burden of proof.\nOn the question, fully argued before us, whether the test to be applied in determining the validity of a requirement is subjective or objective, I agree with and desire to adopt the following passage in the reasons of Porter C.J.O.\nIn the present case the condition is objective, and the question whether he (i.e. the Minister) is acting for the purpose specified in the Act is subject to review, even though he may be acting in an administrative capacity. This question involves an interpretation of the Act and its application to the circumstances disclosed. However, once it is established as in this case that the Minister is acting for the purposes specified in the Act, his acts within this scope are administrative and not judicial, and as such are not subject to review.\nFor these reasons I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Blake, Cassels & Graydon, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Cassels, Brock & Kelley, Toronto.\n[1] [1962] D.T.C. 1014, [1962] C.T.C. 39, 31 D.L.R.

The accused was charged with an offence under ss. 24 and 292 of the Criminal Code of attempting to break and enter a shop with intent to steal. Prior to the trial, he was served with a notice in writing under s. 662(1) (a) (ii) of the Code stating that if he were convicted of this offence an application would be made to the Court to find that he was an habitual criminal and to impose on him a sentence of preventive detention. In due course he was convicted on the substantive offence. At the hearing on the application to impose a sentence of preventive detention, the trial judge heard evidence in support of the allegations contained in the notice, and also took into consideration evidence concerning the accused's previous convictions and past habits which had been given by the accused himself under cross-examination at the trial of the substantive offence. The accused was sentenced to preventive detention as an habitual criminal. The Court of Appeal quashed and set aside the finding that the accused was an habitual criminal. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the sentence of preventive detention restored.\nThe form of the certificates filed by the prosecutor appeared to sufficiently identify the judge who presided at the time of both the convictions and the sentences mentioned therein, and the fact that the convictions mentioned in the certificates and those mentioned in the notice were identical as to the name of the person convicted, the offences committed and the date and nature of the sentences imposed was enough to show that the convictions referred to therein were the same as those referred to in the notice. In any event, the form of the certificates satisfied the provisions of s. 574 of the Code requiring that the conviction be set out with \"reasonable particularity\".\nThe judge presiding at the hearing on the application for imposition of a sentence of preventive detention was entitled to take into consideration the evidence taken at the trial of the substantive offence, and was justified in accepting the accused's own admission of previous convictions as serving to identify him as the person who was convicted. An accused person who elects to go on the witness stand at his own trial has the benefit of all the safeguards referred to in the case of Parkes v. The Queen, [1956] S.C.R. 768, and the evidence elicited from such an accused is admissible and does not violate the provisions of s. 662(2) of the Code.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], quashing and setting aside a finding that the appellant was an habitual criminal. Appeal allowed.\nJ. J. Urie, Q.C., for the appellant.\nH. Rankin, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought by leave of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[2] quashing and setting aside the finding of His Honour Judge Remnant of the County Court of the County of Vancouver that the respondent was an habitual criminal and the consequent imposition of a sentence of preventive detention pursuant to the provisions of s. 660 of the Criminal Code. It is to be noted that the provisions of ss. 660 and 662 of the Criminal Code were substantially amended by c. 43 of the Statutes of Canada (1960-61) which was not in force at the time of the finding and sentence in the present case, and wherever reference is herein made to either of those sections it relates to the Criminal Code as it existed immediately before the said amendment came into force.\nThe respondent, having been charged with an offence under ss. 24 and 292 of the Criminal Code of attempting to break and enter a shop with intent to steal, was, on December 7, 1960, served with a notice in writing in compliance with s. 662(1) (a) (ii) of the Criminal Code stating that if he were convicted of this offence an application would be made to the Court to find that he was an habitual criminal and also to sentence him to preventive detention in addition to any sentence in respect of the said offence. In due course, on December 21, 1960, the respondent was convicted of the said offence before the aforesaid County Court judge who, on January 23, 1961, conducted a hearing in respect of the application to impose a sentence of preventive detention and who, having heard evidence in support of the allegations contained in the said notice and having taken into consideration evidence concerning his previous convictions and his past habits given by the respondent himself under cross-examination at the trial of the substantive offence, proceeded to sentence the respondent to preventive detention as an habitual criminal.\nThe notice given by a prosecutor under the provisions of s. 662(1) (a) (ii) is required to specify \"the previous convictions and the other circumstances, if any, upon which it is intended to found the application \u2026.\" and the notice given in the present case recited, inter alia, that the accused was convicted in the Supreme Court of Alberta at Edmonton before Mr. Justice Clinton J. Ford on the 4th and 8th of October, 1946 of two separate offences, one of \"breaking and entering\" and the other of \"breaking, entering and theft\" for which he was sentenced to terms of five and eight years' imprisonment to run concurrently. The same notice went on to specify that certain other named persons were convicted of the same offences and to describe the premises a broken into, and in the theft case the nature and amount of the property stolen.\nA certificate purporting to be signed by the clerk of the Court \"setting out with reasonable particularity the conviction in Canada of an accused for an indictable offence\" is, upon proof of the identity of the accused, prima facie evidence of that conviction by virtue of the provisions of s. 574 of the Criminal Code.\nIn the present case the certificates of conviction produced by the prosecution in proof of the offences above referred to purport to be signed by the clerk of the Court and are in the following form:\nI, the undersigned, do hereby certify that at a Sitting of the Supreme Criminal Court held at the Court House in the City of Edmonton, the following prisoner, having been duly convicted of the crime set opposite his name, was sentenced as hereunder stated BEFORE THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE CLINTON J. FORD.\nThe body of the two certificates contains the following information:\nDATE OF\nNAME OF PRISONER\nCRIME\nSENTENCE\nSENTENCE\nROBERT McGRATH\nBreak, enter and theft\nOctober 4th,\n1946\nEight (8) years imprisonment in Saskatchewan Penitentiary at Prince Albert, in the Province of Saskatchewan.\nROBERT McGRATH\nBreak, enter\nOctober 8th,\n1946\nFive (5) years imprisonment in the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at Prince Albert, in the Province of Saskatchewan, to run concurrent with previous sentence.\nIn the course of the reasons delivered by Bird J.A. on behalf of the Court of Appeal, that learned judge found that these certificates were insufficient to satisfy the requirements of s. 574 (a) of the Criminal Code on the ground that:\n\u2026neither document contains more than a sketchy reference to the conviction alleged and omits the names of the confederates of the convicted man, the description of the premises broken and of the property stolen as well as the name of the learned Judge presiding at the time when the conviction was entered, all of which are set out in detail in paragraphs (c) and (d) of the notice.\nWith the greatest respect, I must say that the form of the certificates filed by the prosecutor appears to me to sufficiently identify Mr. Justice Clinton J. Ford as the judge who presided at the time of both the convictions and the sentences therein referred to and the fact that the convictions mentioned in the certificates and those mentioned in paras. (c) and (d) of the notice are identical as to the name of the person convicted, the offences committed and the date and nature of the sentences imposed is enough to satisfy me that the convictions referred to therein are the same as those referred to in the notice.\nIn any event, in my view the provisions of s. 574 requiring that the conviction be set out with \"reasonable particularity\" are satisfied by the form of the certificates above referred to, and I am of opinion that the \"reasonable particularity\" required by the section is in no way controlled by the manner in which the offences are described in the notice filed under s. 662 provided that it is apparent that the certificates refer to convictions described in that notice.\nMr. Justice Bird, however, considered that there was no sufficient proof to identify the respondent as the person named in certain of the convictions set out in the certificates and the notice because the only evidence to this effect was elicited from the respondent on cross-examination at the trial of the substantive offence when it was admitted for the sole purpose of testing the respondent's credibility. As will hereafter appear, I am of opinion that the judge presiding at the hearing of the application for imposition of a sentence of preventive detention is entitled to take into consideration the evidence taken at the trial of the substantive offence, and in so doing he is, in my opinion, justified in accepting the accused's own admission of previous convictions as serving to identify him as the person who was convicted.\nA strong argument was made on behalf of the respondent in support of Mr. Justice Bird's further finding that admissions made by him at the trial of the substantive offence as to his past conduct and associations should not have been considered in determining the issue of whether or not he was an habitual criminal. Mr. Justice Bird rested this finding on the ground that consideration of such evidence constituted a violation of the provisions of s. 662(2) of the Criminal Code which reads as follows:\n662. (2) An application under this Part shall be heard and determined before sentence is passed for the offence of which the accused is convicted and shall be heard by the court without a jury.\nIt is contended that the circumstances are governed by the decision of this Court in Parkes v. The Queen[3], in which case highly damaging information concerning the previous career of the convicted person was introduced, directly after his conviction and before the opening of the hearing of the application for imposition of a sentence of preventive detention, in the form of an unsworn \"Probation Officer Presentence Report\". In commenting on the effect of this information on the mind of the judge at the preventive detention hearing, Mr. Justice Fauteux said at p. 779:\nHowever, prior to such hearing, the judge, for the purpose of determining what sentence he should impose, received from the prosecution and exacted from the defence, in a most exhaustive manner, information of a character highly damaging to the accused. In the result, when the subsequent hearing of the issue related to preventive detention commenced, his mind was no longer free, in the measure it should have been, had the provisions of s. 662(2) been complied with, and the effective exercise of the right which the appellant had, on the hearing of such issue, to remain silent and hold the prosecution strictly to its obligation to prove its case according to rules of procedure and rules of evidence, was henceforward jeopardized.\nMr. Justice Bird adopted this reasoning as applying \"with equal force in the present circumstances\", and in so doing it seems to me with all respect that he failed to appreciate that Mr. Justice Fauteux was addressing himself to the special circumstances of the Parkes case in which the mind of the judge at the commencement of the preventive detention hearing \"was no longer free in the measure it should have been\" had the damaging information tendered before him been subjected to the \"rules of procedure and rules of evidence\" which normally attend the trial of any issue.\nThe accepted practice concerning the material which a judge may properly consider before sentencing a convicted person in respect of the offence for which he has been convicted is well described in Crankshaw's Criminal Code of Canada, 7 ed., p. 912, as follows:\nAfter conviction, accurate information should be given as to the general character and other material circumstances of the prisoner even though such information is not available in the form of evidence proper, and such information when given can rightly be taken into consideration by the judge in determining the quantum of punishment, unless it is challenged and contradicted by or on behalf of the prisoner, in which case the judge should either direct proper proof to be given or should ignore the information. There should be precision and accuracy in any such information: \u2026. (The italics are mine.)\nIn the Parkes case, supra, it was held that the introduction of such information between the time of conviction and the opening of the preventive detention hearing constituted a violation of the provisions of s. 662(2) of which section Mr. Justice Fauteux observed at p. 779:\nUnder the imperative provisions of s. 662(2) of the Criminal Code, the hearing and determination of this issue must take place before sentence is passed for the offence of which the accused is convicted. The reason for this order of precedence established in the procedure is to assure the effective operation of all the safeguards which, both by the method of inquiry and by the rules of evidence, attend the trial of any issue and, more particularly to exclude definitely any possibility that the judge entrusted with the matter be, until it is finally determined, adversely influenced in any degree by facts or representations of which, once an accused is convicted, he may, without the same safeguards, be apprised for passing a sentence. (The italics are mine.)\nAn accused person who, like the respondent, elects to go on the witness stand at his own trial has the benefit of all the safeguards to which Mr. Justice Fauteux refers in this passage, and evidence elicited from such an accused on cross-examination is, in my opinion, in an entirely different category from the kind of information with which this Court was concerned in Parkes v. The Queen, supra.\nIt has been pointed out in this Court in the cases of Kirkland v. The Queen[4] and Harnish v. The Queen[5] that the proceedings at the trial of the substantive offence are relevant material for the consideration of a court in determining the issues raised by an application under ss. 660 and 662, but it was seriously contended on behalf of the respondent that His Honour Judge Remnant, when he presided at the preventive detention hearing, was precluded from considering the sworn evidence given at the trial on the ground that a transcript of that evidence was not introduced at the hearing under the oath of the Court reporter. It appears to me to be altogether unrealistic to suggest that in enacting Part XXI of the Criminal Code Parliament intended to provide for a hearing to be interposed between conviction and sentence on the substantive offence at which the trial judge is required to close his mind to relevant evidence adduced before him at the trial which led to the conviction unless and until a transcript of such evidence has been introduced before him at the hearing under the oath of the Court reporter.\nIn my view His Honour Judge Remnant, when he presided at the hearing of the application for imposition of a sentence of preventive detention, was fully justified in taking into consideration the evidence as to his identity and his past life and habits which was given by the accused at his trial, and I am, therefore, with great respect, unable to agree with the Court of Appeal that there was any violation of the provisions of s. 662(2) in the conduct of these proceedings.\nI would allow this appeal and restore the finding of the learned trial judge that the respondent is an habitual criminal and the consequent imposition of a sentence of preventive detention.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: G.

He replied that he intended to walk. The accused said that he heard no such warning and did not remember signing any form containing a warning. He remembered getting into his car and that while driving he became unconscious. His car ran into the rear of a parked vehicle. Medical evidence was given that his mental and physical condition (he was staggering and his co-ordination was poor) was consistent with the after-effects of the drug in question which may induce a state of amnesia accompanied by a period during which the subject may feel competent to drive a car and in the next second be in a condition in which he would not know what was happening. The accused stated that he did not know anything about this drug.\nHe was charged and convicted of the offence of driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by a drug, contrary to s. 223 of the Criminal Code. After a trial de novo before a County Court judge under s. 720 of the Code, his conviction was affirmed. The Court of Appeal granted him leave to appeal and quashed the conviction. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the question as to whether mens rea relating to both the act of driving and to the state of being impaired was an essential element of the offence.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Taschereau J.: There can be no actus reus unless there is a willpower to do an act whether the person knows or not that it is prohibited by law. In the present case, intention was not to be confused with mens rea. Intention is an element of the offence in question only when the offender voluntarily takes liquor or a drug. There must be an act proceeding from a free will which may bring about the mental condition necessary to meet the requirements of s. 223. When a doctor has given an injection of a drug to a patient, who is not aware of the state of mind it may produce, there is no volitive act done by the patient and he could not be convicted under s. 223.\nPer Locke and Judson JJ.: The question of law propounded did not arise upon the facts found at the trial de novo by the County Court judge who found as a fact that the accused knew that he had had a drug and that he was warned not to drive after the anaesthetic, but did not find that the accused\u2019s condition was such that he could not appreciate the warnings given to him. The Court of Appeal found that the accused believed that the drug did not possess properties which would impair or were likely to impair his ability to drive or that he was led to believe and honestly believed that the drug could not have the effect of impairing such ability. These findings were directly in conflict with those of the trial judge. However, as the Crown did not ask leave to appeal on the ground that the Court of Appeal had exceeded its jurisdiction and that question was not argued, the proper course was to dismiss the appeal.\nPer Martland and Ritchie JJ.: The enactment of s. 223 of the Criminal Code added a new crime to the general criminal law, and neither the language in which it was enacted nor the evil which it was intended to prevent are such as to give rise to a necessary implication that Parliament intended to rule out mens rea as an essential ingredient of the crime therein described. When it has been proved that a driver was driving while his ability was impaired by alcohol or a drug, a rebuttable presumption arises that his condition was voluntarily induced. But if it appears that the impairment was produced as a result of using a drug in the form of medicine on a doctor\u2019s order or recommendation and that its effect was unknown to the patient, the presumption is rebutted. Mens rea need not necessarily be present in relation both to the act of driving and to the state of being impaired in order to make the offence complete. The defence that the accused became impaired through no act of his own will and could not reasonably be expected to have known that his ability was impaired or might thereafter become impaired when he undertook to drive and drove his motor vehicle, was a good defence in this case.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing the conviction of the accused. Appeal dismissed.\nW.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the appellant.\nIrving Himel, Q.C., for the respondent.\nTASCHEREAU J.:\u2014I substantially agree with the reasons of my brother Ritchie, and I only wish to add a few personal observations.\nIn his judgment the trial judge, His Honour Judge Timmins, came to the conclusion that s. 223 of the Criminal Code is an express prohibition in respect to driving a motor car when the driver had a drug impairing his driving, and that the defence set up by the accused that this was all involuntary, was not a defence against this section. The Court of Appeal of Ontario1 reached a different conclusion and held that no moral fault could be imputed to the accused and that the act committed in the circumstances of this case must be regarded as involuntary. It held also that the undertaking of the accused to drive the motor car was not a conscious act of the respondent\u2019s volition.\nThe trial judge found the accused guilty, but the Court of Appeal directed a verdict of acquittal. In this Court, special leave to appeal was granted on the following question:\nWhether the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that mens rea relating to both the act of driving and to the state of being impaired by alcohol or drug is an essential element of the offence of driving while impaired contrary to section 223 of the Criminal Code. This section 223 Cr. C., under which the respondent was charged, reads as follows:\n223. DRIVING WHILE ABILITY TO DRIVE IS IMPAIRED.\nEvery one who, while his ability to drive a motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or drug, drives a motor vehicle or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, is guilty of an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable\u2026\nThe Crown\u2019s contention is that under s. 223 Cr. C., the driver of an automobile, whether conscious or not, if he has imbibed liquor or drugs, is guilty of driving while impaired. The result is, as found by the trial judge, that although involuntarily impaired, the accused cannot be absolved.\nThe Crown did not appeal to this Court that part of the judgment of the Court of Appeal dealing with the mental capacity of the respondent. Therefore, the question of jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to deal with the mental capacity of the respondent is not before this Court. The real question arises from the statement of the trial judge (trial de novo) who said in his judgment: \u201cThe defence set by the accused that this was all involuntary is not a defence as against this section.\u201d The majority of the Court of Appeal took the opposite view.\nI entirely disagree with the proposition of the Crown that whether the accused knew he was impaired or not he must be found guilty, and that under s. 223 Cr. C., no mental element has to be considered, and that the mere fact of impairment is sufficient to create the offence.\nIt is my view that there can be no actus reus unless it is the result of a willing mind at liberty to make a definite choice or decision, or in other words, there must be a willpower to do an act whether the accused knew or not that it was prohibited by law.\nThese words mens rea, though they are in common use, are, as Stephen J. said in The Queen v. Tolson[2], most unfortunate and not only likely to mislead but actually misleading. In the present case, intention must not be confused with mens rea. Intention is not an element of the offence of driving while impaired by liquor or drugs, when the offender voluntarily takes liquor or drugs, and then drives a motor vehicle or takes the care or control of it. There must be an act proceeding from a free will that may bring about the mental condition necessary to meet the requirements of s. 223 Cr. C.\nWhen a doctor has given an injection of a drug to a patient, who is not aware of the state of mind it may produce, there is no volitive act done by the driver and he cannot be convicted.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nThe judgment of Locke and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014The charge laid against the respondent and which was tried by a magistrate in Toronto was that he did on October 8, 1959, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, unlawfully:\nWhile his ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired by a drug, drive a motor vehicle License No. 94,547 for the year 1959, at about 3.35 p.m. on Indian Grove near Dundas St. W., contrary to the Criminal Code, section 223.\nSection 223 reads in part:\nEvery one who, while his ability to drive a motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or a drug, drives a motor vehicle or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, is guilty of an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary conviction\u2026\nThe Crown elected to proceed by asking for a summary conviction and the matter was so dealt with by the police magistrate who found the respondent guilty and imposed a fine.\nThe respondent appealed from this conviction to a County Court judge of the County of York, under the provisions of s. 720 of the Criminal Code. After a trial de novo, as required by s. 727, before His Honour Judge Timmins, the conviction was affirmed and the appeal dismissed. The learned County Court judge gave reasons for his judgment and made findings of fact upon which he based his conclusion.\nThe appeal to the Court of Appeal was taken under the provisions of s. 743 of the Criminal Code with leave of that Court. The section, so far as relevant, reads:\nAn appeal to the Court of Appeal as defined in section 581 may with leave of that court be taken on any ground that involves a question of law alone, against\n(a) a decision of a court in respect of an appeal under section 727. The application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal was made upon various grounds and, while leave was granted, the question of law in respect of which the leave was granted is not stated in the judgment of that Court.\nThe Crown applied to this Court for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal[3] and that leave was granted on the following question of law:\nWhether the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that mens rea relating to both the act of driving and to the state of being impaired by alcohol or drug is an essential element of the offence of driving while impaired, contrary to section 223 of the Criminal Code.\nAt the outset of this appeal there lies the question as to whether this question of law arises upon the facts which are to be considered. This is an appeal and not a reference and, unless the question arises upon the facts as found by the learned County Court judge, it should not, in my opinion, be answered.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal, to which I will hereafter refer, disagreed with the findings made by the learned County Court judge but, as to this, and with the greatest respect, it is upon the facts as found by the County Court judge alone that we can deal with this matter.\nThe findings of the learned County Court judge were, so far as they need be considered, expressed as follows:\nThe accused King had gone to see an oral surgeon and had made an appointment to have two teeth extracted on the 8th of October 1959. He attended at the office, the dentist office around two o\u2019clock in the afternoon and he was asked to fill out a form to give the dentist certain written instructions and he says that he filled out the form and then he says that the dentist gave him a needle. The teeth were then extracted and he was taken into the recovery room where he remained for, I believe, half an hour and after that when he came to there was a nurse who had conversation with him, gave him certain instructions and asked him how he was going home and warned him about driving a motor vehicle and then she gave him a receipt and then he left. He walked over to where he had his motor car parked and he proceeded to drive away. He hadn\u2019t gone very far when he said he became unconscious and had a slight accident with another car. Now in a general way that is the evidence.\nAfter referring to the statement of the accused that he did not know anything about sodium pentothal or what its effect would be and that he remembered signing a form but did not admit that there was any warning on the form in respect of the drug and that he did not deny the conversation with the nurse, merely saying that he did not remember it, the learned judge said:\nHe says at the time that he was leaving the office he was not asked if his head was clear although he says that his head was clear. Now the serious defence of the accused is that he had no knowledge of the drug, he did not know anything about the effect of the drug on him and that there was nothing voluntary on his part in respect to driving of the motor car because he was unconscious at the time of the accident and that he cannot be responsible for something that he did involuntarily. The next thing is that he did not know what effect the drug would have therefore he did not know that when he got into his motor car that he might not he subject to further effects of the drug. In other words he says I had no knowledge that it was this drug that was administered to me, I had not knowledge of what the effect would be on me and I have no recollection of this warning that was said to have been given to me and if I did anything that was wrong it was involuntary.\nAfter referring to s. 223 of the Code, the reasons proceed:\nNow having regard to the evidence of the accused, he knew that he had a drug and he was given a warning, with respect to not driving a motor car. The section is an express prohibition in respect to driving a motor car when you have had a drug which will impair your driving and that the defence set up by the accused that this was all involuntary is not a defence as against this section. There were certain warnings that we have heard in evidence here today and I have got to pay some attention to. First is that he was expected to sign a form, and that form contained a warning,\u2014\u201dPatient is cautioned not to drive after anaesthetic until head clears.\u201d I would have thought that that warning in itself was sufficient and the accused does not admit that he signed this form, he admits he signed some form.\n* * *\nNow the other warning was that Nurse Childs saw him when he regained consciousness in the recovery room and that she talked with him, she gave him some instructions, his account was paid and she asked him how he was going home and he said that he was walking, she told him you can\u2019t drive until your head is perfectly clear, he said that he was walking and he left.\n* * *\nThis young man apparently had his motor car in the district to drive home. He knew that he was going to get some treatment, some injection or he was going to be given something in the doctor\u2019s office in order to have his teeth extracted. He was given a drug intravenously and a certain state of amnesia was produced. He was given a warning I find by the dental nurse. I find as a fact that he was given that warning but whether he deliberately lied to the nurse or whether he unconsciously lied to her the fact of the matter is that he did misinform the nurse that he was walking. He took the responsibility of going to the car, he took the responsibility of driving his car knowing that he had had a drug, he was driving his car and the charge is that he was in charge of a motor vehicle when his ability was impaired. There is no doubt that on all the evidence that he was impaired. In argument by counsel for the accused there were reflections cast upon the dental profession that they should never allow persons who have had this drug in respect to extractions of teeth to leave their office unless he is accompanied by some other adult person so that he cannot get into trouble. In this case there were warnings and the accused paid no attention to them.\nThe judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal was given by Schroeder J.A. and it is upon the facts as found by him that the case for the respondent has been argued before us. In the reasons delivered by that learned judge the following appears:\nThe learned County Court judge reached the conclusion upon the evidence that the appellant was or should have been aware that his ability to drive a motor car might be impaired by the use of this drug and accordingly he held that he was bound to uphold the conviction. In my respectful opinion the evidence falls far short of supporting that conclusion. On the contrary, the evidence indicates at most that the accused was advised by the nurse and at a time when his mind was probably in a muddled or confused state (undetected mental impairment as described by Dr. Lucas) that he should not drive \u201cuntil his head was perfectly clear.\u201d It is highly probable that, as he stated, he did not observe the caution on the printed form mentioned by Dr. Richards. The evidence of Dr. Lucas suggests rather forcibly that the appellant would not have been fully restored to normalcy for at least eight hours, yet he was told that he should not drive until \u201chis head was perfectly clear.\u201d This was left to the judgment of a man who, at that time, was probably in a state of \u201cundetected mental impairment.\u201d In that condition, he would unwittingly delude both the nurse and himself. The evidence overwhelmingly supports the view that when the appellant undertook to drive his motor car he did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known that his ability to drive was then or might thereafter become impaired, and in a criminal case any contrary view would, in my opinion, be untenable.\nThe question to be determined is whether the absence of such knowledge on the part of the appellant in the particular circumstances is sufficient to exculpate him.\nLater the reasons continue:\nThe problem thus presented is this: If A attends at the office of a duly qualified surgeon where a drug is administered to him, and he honestly believes that such drug does not possess properties which will impair or are likely to impair his ability to drive a motor car; or to fit the case at bar more precisely\u2014if he is led to believe and honestly believes that when his head is perfectly clear the drug cannot then have the effect of impairing his ability to drive and he, in good faith, believes that advice and acts upon it, would A, in the supposed circumstances, be guilty of the crime of driving a motor car while his ability to drive was impaired if that condition should develop unexpectedly after he had entered his motor car and had commenced to operate it?\nAnd again:\nWhere, therefore, a person is given a drug by his physician who does not warn him that it is likely to affect his ability to drive, and the patient not being negligent in failing to realize that fact, the drug takes sudden effect while he is driving he would not, in my view, be guilty of an offence against section 223. The facts must be viewed as a whole commencing at the point when the drug was first administered by the doctor. The conclusion cannot be avoided that in that case the patient was not even negligent.\n* * *\nHere the appellant had no reason to anticipate that the drug administered to him would impair his ability to drive a motor car \u201cafter his head had cleared.\u201d His undertaking to drive or his driving of the motor car was not, in the circumstances, a conscious act of the appellant\u2019s volition.\n* * *\nUnless the appellant knew or ought to have known that when he undertook to drive, the effect of the drug would incapacitate him within the meaning of section 223, he could not have entertained the will to drive while his ability to do so was impaired or was likely to become impaired.\nMcKay J.A., who dissented and would have dismissed the appeal, agreed with the findings of fact made by the learned trial judge but pointed out that the form signed by the respondent which contained the warning against driving was signed on Tuesday October 6th, two days in advance of the extraction of his teeth, at which time there is no suggestion that he was under the influence of any drug, and the further fact that when he was apprehended by the police officer he told him that he had been to the dentist and been given sodium pentothal, which is at variance with the respondent\u2019s evidence that he did not know what drug had been given to him, and that this fact was stated by him as his explanation for the accident.\nIt will be seen from the foregoing that the trial judge found as a fact that the respondent knew that he had had a drug and that he was warned not to drive after the anaesthetic. In referring to the warning on the form, the learned judge said that he would have thought that warning was sufficient and found further as a fact that the respondent had been warned by the nurse and that he had made the statement to her that he was walking after leaving the dentist\u2019s office, which was untrue, and that his action in driving the car in these circumstances was deliberate. The learned judge did not find that the condition of the respondent was such that he could not appreciate the warnings given to him.\nSchroeder J.A. did not proceed upon the footing that there was no evidence to support these findings but, upon his own view of the evidence, he considered that at the time the warning was given by the nurse the respondent was in a muddled or confused state and that it was highly probable that he did not observe the caution on the printed form and that, in the condition he was, \u201che would unwittingly delude both the nurse and himself.\u201d It was said further that the evidence overwhelmingly supported the view that he \u201cdid not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known that his ability to drive was then or might thereafter become impaired.\u201d The statement thereafter made as to the question to be determined is based upon the premise that the respondent honestly believed that the drug did not possess properties which would impair or were likely to impair his ability to drive or that he was led to believe and honestly believed that the drug could not have the effect of impairing such ability. These findings directly conflict with those of the judge at the trial.\nIn my view, the question of law upon which leave to appeal was granted upon the application of the Crown does not arise upon the facts found by the learned County Court judge and these are the facts upon which the appeal must be determined. Upon those findings of fact, in agreement with McKay J.A. I consider that the accused was properly found guilty and the judgment should not have been set aside.\nWhile the findings of fact made in the majority judgment in the Court of Appeal do raise the question propounded, since this is not a reference I do not consider that we should answer the question since it is unnecessary for the disposition of the appeal. Had the respondent been successful in obtaining a finding of fact from the learned County Court judge that he was unaware of the probable effect of the drug and had not been warned as to this, issues which were matters of defence, the situation would be otherwise, but there are no such findings.\nThe Crown, however, did not ask leave to appeal on the ground that the Court of Appeal had exceeded its jurisdiction and the question was not argued before us. In these circumstances, the proper course to be pursued, in my opinion, is to dismiss this appeal.\nThe judgment of Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014This is an appeal by the Crown at the instance of the Attorney-General for Ontario from a judgment rendered by the majority of the Court of Appeal of that province[4] (MacKay J.A. dissenting) which allowed the respondent\u2019s appeal from a conviction entered against him after a trial de novo held before Judge Timmins of the County Court of the County of York for the offence of driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by a drug contrary to s. 223 of the Criminal Code.\nThe circumstances giving rise to this appeal are that on October 8, 1959, the respondent went to his dentist\u2019s office, by appointment, for the purpose of having two teeth extracted, and that he was there injected with a drug known as sodium pentothal, a quick-acting anaesthetic which produces unconsciousness, removes pain and gives a certain amount of relaxation during the period of an operation, and before using which the dentist stated that it was the practice of his office to have patients sign a printed form containing the following warning: \u201cPatients are cautioned not to drive after anaesthetic until head clears.\u201d After he had regained consciousness, the respondent paid his bill by cheque to a nurse who was in attendance and who states that at this time he appeared \u201cperfectly normal\u201d and that she warned him not to drive his car until his head was \u201cperfectly clear\u201d to which he replied that he intended to walk. The respondent says that he heard no such warning and remembers signing no form containing any warning, but he does remember getting into his car which he had parked about a block away and proceeding across an intersection, after which he became unconscious, and his car ran into the left rear portion of a parked vehicle, whereafter the police appeared to find that he was staggering and that his physical co-ordination was poor. This was later verified by a sergeant at the police station where the respondent was submitted to certain tests. Medical evidence was given to the effect that this mental and physical condition was consistent with the after-effects of being injected with sodium pentothal and that this drug may induce a state of amnesia accompanied by a period during which the subject may feel perfectly competent to get in a car and drive and in the next second or so be in a condition in which he would not know what was happening. The respondent stated that he did not know anything about the drug which was administered to him. The learned County Court judge convicted the respondent on the ground that \u201che knew that he had a drug and he was given a warning with respect to driving a motor car\u201d and also that \u201che took the responsibility of going to the car, he took the responsibility of driving his car knowing that he had had a drug\u201d.\nThe respondent\u2019s sole defence was that he had no knowledge of the effect of the drug which resulted in his being unaware of any warning and unaware of the fact that he was impaired when he took the responsibility to drive and did drive his car.\nThe County Court judge expressed the following view of the evidence as to the effect of the drug:\nEvidence seems to point out that this would produce amnesia and that the patient would go unconscious and that this may last for some considerable time or it might last just for a short time.\nIf the County Court judge had found that the respondent knew of the possible effects of the drug before he took it or that he was capable of being aware of the fact that he was impaired when he started to drive and drove his car, then the question now before this Court would not have arisen in this case, but the judge made no such finding but disposed of the respondent\u2019s only defence in accordance with his view of the legal effect of s. 223 of the Criminal Code which he expressed as follows:\nThe section is an express prohibition in respect to driving a motor car when you have had a drug which would impair your driving and that the defence set up by the accused that this was all involuntary is not a defence against this section. (The italics are mine.)\nExpressing the same opinion in slightly different language, he later said: \u201cThere is nothing in Section 223 of the Code about an involuntary act. The section is specific.\u201d\nThe question of law so determined was made a ground of appeal and for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal of Ontario, and Mr. Justice MacKay, in the course of his dissenting opinion, stated the issue before that Court in the clearest terms, saying: \u201cI think all these grounds of appeal raise only one issue, that is, to what extent, if at all, does the doctrine of mens rea apply to this offence.\u201d\nJust as the learned County Court judge dealt with this issue in the concluding paragraph of his reasons by saying: \u201cIn this case the accused was impaired by reason of a drug. I cannot hold anything else, and, therefore, the conviction will be affirmed\u2026\u201d, so Mr. Justice MacKay expressed the same conclusion rather more fully by saying:\nFor these reasons I have come to the conclusion that the offence here charged is one of strict liability in which proof of actus reus alone is required, that is, proof that the defendant drove his car and was in fact impaired. In this particular case the defendant knew he had been given a drug and he intentionally drove his car. Even if it was a fact that he did not know or did not believe that he was impaired such knowledge or belief is not material and is not a defence.\nOn the other hand, Mr. Justice Schroeder, speaking for the majority of the Court, stated the exactly opposite view in these words:\nEven in the case of statutory crimes, therefore, the offender should not be condemned if his conduct was not voluntary, save in cases where such exception is expressly or by necessary implication excluded in the Act creating the offence\u2026\nUnless the appellant knew or ought to have known that when he undertook to drive, the effect of the drug would incapacitate him within the meaning of section 223, he could not have entertained the will to drive while his ability to do so was impaired or was likely to become impaired. This is a true case of ignorantia facti which should have been held to have excused the actus reus prohibited by the statute.\nThese quotations are sufficient to indicate the sharp difference of opinion which existed in the Courts below as to a decisive question of law, and although it may be said, with all respect, that the judges in the Court of Appeal strayed into the making of some unnecessary observations on the facts, it is nonetheless the question of law which gave rise to this difference which has been made the subject of the sole ground upon which leave to appeal to this Court has been granted under the provisions of s, 41(3) of the Supreme Court Act. That question is expressed in the order by which leave to appeal was granted as follows:\nWhether the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that mens rea relating to both the act of driving and to the state of being impaired by alcohol or drug is an essential element of the offence of driving while impaired contrary to Section 223 of the Criminal Code.\nThe provisions of s. 223 of the Code are as follows:\n223. Every one who, while his ability to drive a motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or a drug, drives a motor vehicle or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, is guilty of an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable (a) for a first offence, to a fine of not more than five hundred dollars and not less than fifty dollars or to imprisonment for three months or to both,\n(b) for a second offence, to imprisonment for not more than three months and not less than fourteen days, and\n(c) for each subsequent offence, to imprisonment for not more than one year and not less than three months.\nThe cases in England and Australia which have been so fully reviewed by the Court of Appeal indicate that there have been differences in approach in determining the extent to which \u201cknowledge of the wrongfulness of the act\u201d is to be regarded as a constituent in statutory offences.\nIn the decision of Wright J. in Sherras v. De Rutzen[5], that learned judge stated:\nThere is a presumption that mens rea, an evil intention, or a knowledge of the wrongfulness of the act, is an essential ingredient in every offence; but that presumption is liable to be displaced either by the words of the statute creating the offence or by the subject-matter with which it deals and both must be considered.\nOn the other hand, in the case of Hobbs v. Winchester Corporation[6], which involved the sale of tainted meat contrary to the Public Health Act, Kennedy L.J. concluded that \u201cthere is a clear balance of authority that in construing a modern statute this presumption as to mens rea does not exist\u201d.\nThe weight of opinion, however, clearly favours the view expressed by Wright J. and the rule has been forcefully stated on more than one occasion by Lord Goddard C.J. who expressed himself in the following language in Harding v. Price[7]:\nThe general rule applicable to criminal cases is actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea, and I venture to repeat what I said in Brend v. Wood, (1946) 62 T.L.R. 462, 463: \u201cIt is of the utmost importance for the protection of the liberty of the subject that a court should always bear in mind that unless a statute either clearly or by necessary implication rules out mens rea as a constituent part of a crime, the court should not find a man guilty of an offence against the criminal law unless he has a guilty mind\u201d.\n(See also Younghusband v. Luftig[8], and the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in Regina v. Jollimore[9] per Mr. Justice V.C. MacDonald at p. 306 et seq.) This view has been adopted by this Court in unmistakable terms in Beaver v. The Queen[10], where Cartwright J., speaking for the majority of the Court at p. 538, adopted the following statement made by Estey J. in Watts and Gaunt v. The Queen[11]:\nWhile an offence of which mens rea is not an essential ingredient may be created by legislation, in view of the general rule a section creating an offence ought not to be so construed unless Parliament has, by express language or necessary implication, disclosed such an intention.\nAs there is no express language in s. 223 of the Criminal Code disclosing the intention of Parliament to rule out mens rea as an essential ingredient of the crime therein described, it becomes necessary to determine whether it can be said that such an intention is disclosed by necessary implication.\nIn classifying the types of statute in which such an intention has been implied, the learned authors, writing under the title \u201cCriminal Law and Procedure\u201d in vol. 10 of Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, 3rd ed., at p. 275, adopt the three exceptions to the general rule which are suggested by Wright J. in Sherras v. De Rutzen, supra, at p. 921 and state:\nMost statutes creating a strict liability fall under three heads. First, where the acts are not criminal in any real sense, but are prohibited under a penalty in the public interest. Secondly, where the acts are public nuisances; thus, an employer has been held liable on indictment for a nuisance caused by workmen without his knowledge and contrary to his orders. Thirdly, where, although the proceeding is criminal in form, it is really only a summary mode of enforcing a civil right.\nMr. Justice MacKay concluded that s. 223 of the Criminal Code comes within the first exception to the general rule in that it is \u201can act perhaps not criminal in any real sense but which is in the public interest prohibited\u201d. He finds that:\nA person whose ability to drive is impaired by alcohol or drugs, driving on the highway, is a danger to the general public and in my view the offence falls within the first classification referred to by Wright J. in the Sherras case. It is an act perhaps not criminal in any real sense but which is in the public interest prohibited.\nI am, with respect, unable to agree that the offence created by s. 223 is \u201cperhaps not criminal in any real sense\u201d. On the contrary, it appears to me that if a person takes charge of a motor vehicle on the highways of this country knowing that his ability to do so is impaired by alcohol or a drug, he is doing an act which is not only criminal in the sense of being punishable by the Criminal Code but which is also criminal in the \u201creal sense\u201d as those words were used by Wright J. because such a driver must be taken to be aware that his impaired condition constitutes a danger to the life, limb and safety of other users of the highway, and the question of whether he acted knowingly or not, therefore, seems to me to be all the more important.\nIt is to be observed also that when Wright J. was referring to acts \u201cwhich\u2026are not criminal in any real sense,\u2026\u201d he was referring to such things as the possession of liquorice by a beer retailer, the possession of adulterated tobacco, the possession of game by a carrier and such like matters, all of which are far removed from the offence of driving a potentially highly dangerous machine when your ability to do so is impaired.\nIn my view the seriousness of the offence created by s. 223 removes it entirely from the categories referred to by Wright J. and this will be seen to be recognized by the mandatory provisions in s. 223(b) and (c) which provide for imprisonment for a second or subsequent offence.\nIn the course of his decision in Beaver v. The Queen, supra, at p. 542, Cartwright J. had occasion to observe that in that case:\nCounsel informed us that they have found no other statutory provision which has been held to create a crime of strict responsibility, that is to say, one in which the necessity for mens rea is excluded, on conviction for which a sentence of imprisonment is mandatory.\nNo such statute has been referred to us in the present case, and it appears to me that the nature of the penalty imposed by s. 223(b) and (c) affords an indication that Parliament did not intend to exclude mens rea as an essential ingredient of the offence which it created.\nIt is, however, submitted on behalf of the appellant that s. 223 ought to be construed to create an offence of absolute liability on the ground that \u201cthe object of the legislation is patently to protect the public from danger\u201d, but I am unable to agree that the legislative intention to protect the public from harm or danger can, of itself, provide an exception to the general rule as to the existence of mens rea. If this were so, it would indeed encompass a wide variety of criminal acts, for as Rand J. said in Lord\u2019s Day Alliance v. Attorney-General for British Columbia[12]:\nUndoubtedly criminal acts are those forbidden by law, ordinarily at least if not necessarily accompanied by penal sanctions, enacted to serve what is considered a public interest or to interdict what is deemed a public harm or evil. (The italics are mine.)\nIn the course of his most interesting dissenting opinion, MacKay J.A. refers to the decision of Dixon J. of the High Court of Australia in Proudman v. Dayman[13]. The learned judge in that case was dealing with an offence against the Road Traffic Act of South Australia which is a jurisdiction where no code of criminal law exists, and he had occasion to say of the presumption as to the existence of mens rea as an essential ingredient of crime:\nThe strength of the presumption that the rule applies to a statutory offence newly created varies with the nature of the offence and the scope of the statute. If the purpose of the statute is to add a new crime to the general criminal law, it is natural to suppose that it is to be read subject to the general principles according to which that law is administered. But other considerations arise where in matters of police, of health, of safety or the like the legislature adopts penal measures in order to cast on the individual the responsibility of so conducting his affairs that the general welfare will not be prejudiced.\nIn my view the enactment of s. 223 of the Criminal Code added a new crime to the general criminal law, and neither the language in which it was enacted nor the evil which it was intended to prevent are such as to give rise to a necessary implication that Parliament intended to impose absolute liability unless the impaired condition which the section prohibits was brought about by some conscious act of the will or intention.\nConsideration of this phase of the question should not be concluded without noting the decision in Armstrong v. Clark[14], in which the Queen\u2019s Bench Division had to consider the question of\n\u2026whether the taking of insulin by the respondent was, in the circumstances which occurred, to be regarded as taking a drug which would make him liable to be found guilty of an offence under s. 15(1)\u2026\nof the Road Traffic Act, and in which Lord Goddard said:\nThis case must go back with a direction that the justices may take into account a great many things, but they must remember, and everyone must remember, that this section was designed for the protection of the public, and if people happen to be in a condition of health that renders them subject to going into a coma, or forces them to take remedies which may send them into a coma, the answer is that they must not drive because they are a danger to the rest of Her Majesty\u2019s subjects.\nI do not think that anything that was said by Lord Goddard in that case can be taken as changing the law with respect to mens rea in statutory offences as it was stated by the same learned judge and adopted by this Court in the cases hereinbefore referred to. It is noteworthy, however, that in the course of this decision, Lord Goddard does make the observation with respect to the statutory offence with which he was dealing: \u201cThe penalty, I need hardly say, is entirely at the discretion of the bench.\u201d\nThe existence of mens rea as an essential ingredient of an offence and the method of proving the existence of that ingredient are two different things, and I am of opinion that when it has been proved that a driver was driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug, then a rebuttable presumption arises that his condition was voluntarily induced and that he is guilty of the offence created by s. 223 and must be convicted unless other evidence is adduced which raises a reasonable doubt as to whether he was, through no fault of his own, disabled when he undertook to drive and drove, from being able to appreciate and know that he was or might become impaired.\nIf the driver\u2019s lack of appreciation when he undertook to drive was induced by voluntary consumption of alcohol or of a drug which he knew or had any reasonable ground for believing might cause him to be impaired, then he cannot, of course, avoid the consequences of the impairment which results by saying that he did not intend to get into such a condition, but if the impairment has been brought about without any act of his own will, then, in my view, the offence created by s. 223 cannot be said to have been committed.\nThe existence of a rebuttable presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of his own conduct is a part of our law, but its application to any particular situation involves a consideration of what consequences a man might be reasonably expected to foresee under the circumstances. In the course of the lecture on \u201cThe Criminal Law\u201d which is contained in the well-known work by O.W. Holmes Jr. on the \u201cCommon Law\u201d, that learned author says:\nAs the purpose is to compel men to abstain from dangerous conduct, and not merely to restrain them from evil inclinations, the law requires them at their peril to know the teachings of common experience, just as it requires them to know the law.\nIt seems to me that it can be taken as a matter of \u201ccommon experience\u201d that the consumption of alcohol may produce intoxication and, therefore, \u201cimpairment\u201d in the sense in which that word is used in s. 223, and I think it is also to be similarly taken to be known that the use of narcotics may have the same effect, but if it appears that the impairment was produced as a result of using a drug in the form of medicine on a doctor\u2019s order or recommendation and that its effect was unknown to the patient, then the presumption is, in my view, rebutted.\nFor all the above reasons, I do not think that the Court of Appeal erred in holding that mens rea was an essential element of the offence of driving while impaired contrary to s. 223 of the Criminal Code, but I am of opinion that that element need not necessarily be present in relation both to the act of driving and to the state of being impaired in order to make the offence complete. That is to say, that a man who becomes impaired as the result of taking a drug on medical advice without knowing its effect cannot escape liability if he became aware of his impaired condition before he started to drive his car just as a man who did not appreciate his impaired condition when he started to drive cannot escape liability on the ground that his lack of appreciation was brought about by voluntary consumption of liquor or drug. The defence in the present case was that the respondent became impaired through no act of his own will and could not reasonably be expected to have known that his ability was impaired or might thereafter become impaired when he undertook to drive and drove his motor vehicle.\nI would dismiss this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.C.

She also gave a promise of sale of the house where she was living, and if the conditions were fulfilled, on her death, the former employee and her husband would become proprietors of the house by virtue of a deed that her legatees would execute. The spinster died a few days after the signature of the document which was not registered. The defendants, as executors, contended that the agreement was in the nature of a gift inter vivos of real property and void for lack of registration during the donor's lifetime. The trial judge dis- missed the action on that ground. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench where the majority held that it was not a gift inter vivos but an onerous contract. The executors appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. Even though the plaintiffs took the attributes of donees by reason of the fact that due to the sudden death they did not have to give anything in return, this should not affect the consideration of the question. There can be no gift without an animus donandi and a transmission of values without the receipt of something equivalent. Equivalence does not mean equality. The solution of the question could not depend solely on a purely mathematical comparison between the value of what was given and the value of the obligations assumed, as this would entirely disregard the factor of intention. The Court of Appeal had correctly held that the agreement was not a gift but a commutative contract. Each of the parties in this case expected to receive a benefit from the other equivalent to the benefit it was to bestow on the other.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Brossard J. Appeal dismissed.\nRoch Pinard, Q.C., for the defendants, appellants.\nG\u00e9rard Beaupr\u00e9 and Marcel Trudeau, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014Les appelants, \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires de feu Marie-Anne Martel, appellent d'une d\u00e9cision majoritaire de la Cour du banc de la reine1 infirmant le jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure qui avait rejet\u00e9 l'action en passation de titres intent\u00e9e contre eux par l'intim\u00e9, tant personnellement qu'en sa qualit\u00e9 de chef de la communaut\u00e9 existant entre lui et son \u00e9pouse.\nVoici sommairement les circonstances donnant lieu \u00e0 ce litige. Mademoiselle Martel r\u00e9sidait \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al et, de 1941 \u00e0 1947, y exploitait un restaurant avec l'assistance de son employ\u00e9e et amie, Dame Gagnon, \u00e9pouse de l'intim\u00e9, qui \u00e9tait alors c\u00e9libataire. Les deux vivaient ensemble \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re de l'\u00e9tablissement. Advenant 1947, Mademoiselle Martel dut, sur l'avis de son m\u00e9decin, abandonner cette exploitation. Elle se fit construire une maison \u00e0 appartements o\u00f9 elle et son amie all\u00e8rent continuer de vivre en commun jusqu'au jour o\u00f9, en d\u00e9cembre 1948, cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9pousa l'intim\u00e9. Les \u00e9poux Gagnon s'install\u00e8rent dans un logement contigu \u00e0 celui de Mademoiselle Martel et y demeur\u00e8rent jusqu'en 1954 alors qu'en raison de la naissance d'un nouvel enfant, ils durent aller loger dans un appartement moins exigu. Apr\u00e8s, comme avant le mariage, Dame Gagnon continua de prodiguer \u00e0 Mademoiselle Martel son amiti\u00e9 et son assistance. Durant l'\u00e9t\u00e9 de 1955, Mademoiselle Martel fit une thrombose c\u00e9r\u00e9brale ou une nouvelle h\u00e9mipl\u00e9gie. Alors \u00e2g\u00e9e de 57 ans, sans aucun parent \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al et ne pouvant aucunement se suffire \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame, elle songea qu'en offrant des compensations appropri\u00e9es, elle pourrait peut-\u00eatre persuader Dame Gagnon \u00e0 venir, avec sa famille, vivre avec elle jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de ses jours et qu'elle pourrait ainsi s'assurer, jusqu'\u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, l'attention et tous les soins imp\u00e9rieusement n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 son \u00e9tat. Elle fit part de ce projet aux Gagnon. Ces derniers accept\u00e8rent d'y donner suite aux termes et conditions arr\u00eat\u00e9s dans une convention notari\u00e9e, faite et sign\u00e9e par les parties le 1er septembre 1955. C'est sur ce contrat que se fonde l'action en passation de titres faisant l'objet du litige.\nIl suffit de donner la substance des obligations r\u00e9ciproquement assum\u00e9es par les parties aux fins ci-dessus. Mademoiselle Martel s'engagea \u00e0 partager son appartement avec les Gagnon et \u00e0 faire faire les travaux n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'am\u00e9nagement du sous-sol de l'immeuble pour l'usage exclusif de leur famille, et ce, sans charge de loyer. Elle leur consentit, de plus, une promesse de vente de son immeuble pour un dollar et en consid\u00e9ration des obligations assum\u00e9es par ceux-ci \u00e0 son endroit; convenant, les parties, que l'acte de vente serait diff\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la mort de Mademoiselle Martel pour \u00eatre alors ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 par ses h\u00e9ritiers ou repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux, et que les Gagnon y assumeraient les charges ou toute hypoth\u00e8que affectant l'immeuble et respecteraient les baux existants. Il fut entendu que Mademoiselle Martel ne pourrait vendre ou autrement disposer de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, gardant cependant le droit de renouveler ou remplacer l'hypoth\u00e8que l'affectant, conservant tous droits et pouvoirs d'administration tel que le droit de louer, percevoir les loyers et revenus de l'immeuble, ainsi que les obligations du propri\u00e9taire, jusqu'\u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s. Les Gagnon, d'autre part, s'oblig\u00e8rent \u00e0 vivre avec Mademoiselle Martel, \u00e0 prendre soin de sa personne, \u00e0 lui fournir le logement, la nourrir et l'entretenir \u00e0 leurs frais\u2014sauf les frais m\u00e9dicaux et autres d\u00e9penses extraordinaires d\u00e9pendant de son \u00e9tat\u2014jusqu'\u00e0 sa mort. Les parties stipul\u00e8rent que cette convention prendrait fin soit par consentement mutuel, soit par la volont\u00e9 unilat\u00e9rale des Gagnon ou \u00e0 leur d\u00e9faut de remplir fid\u00e8lement leurs obligations, soit enfin dans le cas o\u00f9 Dame Gagnon pr\u00e9d\u00e9c\u00e9derait Mademoiselle Martel.\nA la date m\u00eame de cette convention, Mademoiselle Martel fit son testament, disposant de ses biens en faveur des personnes d\u00e9sign\u00e9es et assign\u00e9es en la pr\u00e9sente action comme mises-en-cause.\nOnze jours plus tard, soit le 12 septembre 1955, Mademoiselle Martel d\u00e9c\u00e9dait.\nL'intim\u00e9 requit alors les appelants de lui signer le contrat de vente et, sur leur refus, institua contre eux la pr\u00e9sente action.\nEn d\u00e9fense, les ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires plaid\u00e8rent, inter alia, que cette convention du 1er septembre 1955 constitue une donation entre vifs de biens immobiliers, frapp\u00e9e de nullit\u00e9 par d\u00e9faut d'enregistrement du vivant de la donatrice, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence l'immeuble en question \u00e9tait d\u00e9volu aux h\u00e9ritiers testamentaires de Mademoiselle Martel.\nDans un jugement fort \u00e9labor\u00e9, M. le Juge Brossard, de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, analyse tous les moyens de d\u00e9fense, retenant comme \u00e9tant le seul fond\u00e9 le moyen ci-dessus sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9. Pour ce motif, la Cour d\u00e9clare que la convention est sans valeur et sans effet quant aux ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires et aux h\u00e9ritiers mis-en-cause, et rejette l'action.\nCe jugement fut infirm\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire de la Cour d'Appel. M. le Juge en chef Galipeault et MM. les Juges Hyde, Rinfret et Owen, de la majorit\u00e9, \u00e9tant d'opinion que la convention du 1er septembre 1955 n'est pas une donation mais bien un contrat on\u00e9reux, accueillent l'action de l'intim\u00e9 et condamnent les appelants \u00e0 lui passer titres. Dissident, M. le Juge Bissonnette exprime l'avis que les parties \u00e0 cette convention ont, consciemment ou non, form\u00e9 une donation \u00e0 cause de mort et, partant, un contrat prohib\u00e9 par la loi. Pour ce motif, diff\u00e9rent de celui retenu en Cour de premi\u00e8re instance, il confirme le dispositif du jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nDe l\u00e0 l'appel des ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires \u00e0 cette Cour. La question fondamentale \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer est de savoir si, comme le pr\u00e9tendent les appelants, Mademoiselle Martel, dans une intention lib\u00e9rale et sans contre-partie \u00e9quivalente, s'est, dans les circonstances, irr\u00e9vocablement d\u00e9pouill\u00e9e de son immeuble en faveur des Gagnon ou si, comme ces derniers le soumettent, cette convention du 1er septembre 1955 constitue un acte commutatif et non pas un acte de lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9.\nSi, pour r\u00e9soudre la question, il fallait s'en tenir au sens litt\u00e9ral de certains termes utilis\u00e9s \u00e0 l'acte, on ne saurait y voir de donation. C'est \u00e0 la commune intention des parties contractantes qu'il faut, cependant, s'attacher en se reportant au temps de l'ex\u00e9cution de la convention. Et doit \u00eatre \u00e9cart\u00e9 de la consid\u00e9ration le fait qu'en raison de la soudainet\u00e9 impr\u00e9vue du d\u00e9c\u00e8s subs\u00e9quent de Mademoiselle Martel, \u2014dont les expectatives de vie \u00e9taient de dix ans, suivant l'opinion de son m\u00e9decin, \u2014les Gagnon, recevant tout sans avoir eu rien \u00e0 donner encore, prennent, en fait, vraiment figure de donataires.\nIl n'y a pas de lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 sans la pr\u00e9sence de l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment intellectuel ou psychologique, I'animus donandi, et sans la pr\u00e9sence de l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment mat\u00e9riel, la transmission de valeurs sans contre-partie \u00e9quivalente.

Dans le cas o\u00f9 celui qui re\u00e7oit re\u00e7oit subordonn\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution de certaines charges, on consid\u00e8re, particuli\u00e8rement, pour d\u00e9terminer la nature de l'acte, si ces charges sont stipul\u00e9es au profit de celui qui donne, ou au profit d'un tiers, et si elles sont \u00e9quivalentes ou non \u00e0 la valeur de ce qui est donn\u00e9. Il s'agit d'\u00e9quivalence et non d'\u00e9galit\u00e9. Eh toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, la solution ne saurait d\u00e9pendre uniquement d'une comparaison purement math\u00e9matique entre la valeur des biens donn\u00e9s et la valeur des charges impos\u00e9es; ce serait ne tenir aucun compte du facteur intentionnel. Le contrat sera tenu comme un contrat commutatif et non comme une donation \u00abs'il r\u00e9unit des parties qui ne se sont engag\u00e9es qu'\u00e0 raison de ce fait que chacune d'elles estime recevoir de l'autre un avantage correspondant \u00e0 celui qu'elle lui procure. Alors seulement on peut dire qu'il y a \u00e9quivalence entre les prestations des parties\u00bb Baudry-Lacantinerie, Droit Civil, tome 10, p. 515, n\u00b0 1136. Voil\u00e0 le crit\u00e8re qui doit nous guider et qui, \u00e0 mon avis, a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce par les Juges de la majorit\u00e9 en Cour du banc de la reine, pour conclure, \u00e0 bon droit je crois, que la convention du 1er septembre 1955 n'est pas une donation mais un contrat commutatif. Si l'on consid\u00e8re, d'une part, que Mademoiselle Martel vivait seule, sans proches \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, impotente et dans l'urgente n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'avoir et de s'assurer des soins jusqu'\u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, et son d\u00e9sir que cette s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et ces soins lui fussent donn\u00e9s par une personne qu'elle connaissait bien, son amie, dame Gagnon, et que, d'autre part, les Gagnon s'engageaient \u00e0 sacrifier l'intimit\u00e9 de leur vie familiale pour vivre en commun avec Mademoiselle Martel, prendre soin de sa personne, la nourrir et l'entretenir \u00e0 leurs frais jusqu'\u00e0 sa mort, et si, de plus, l'on tient compte du fait que les Gagnon ont obtenu le droit de reviser, en aucun temps, leur position et remettre en balance, au regard les uns des autres, les droits et obligations leur r\u00e9sultant de cette convention, il appara\u00eet, \u00e0 mon avis, qu'en signant le contrat, chacune des parties a estim\u00e9 recevoir de l'autre un avantage correspondant \u00e0 celui qu'elle lui procurait.\nPour ces motifs, qui sont en substance ceux des Juges de la majorit\u00e9 en Cour du banc de la reine, je renverrais l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the defendants, appellants: Pinard, Pigeon, Pare & Lejour, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, respondent: Beaupr\u00e9 & Trudeau, Montreal.\n1 [1961] Que.

The petitioner company was incorporated under The Companies Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 27. The capital of the company was declared to consist, inter alia, of a number of non-cumulative class \"B\" preference shares of a par value of $25 each, and which were not redeemable. It was provided that on the voluntary winding-up of the company, the holders of the class \"B\" shares would be entitled to the repayment of the amount paid up on such shares and an additional $5 per share. The company petitioned for a winding-up order under s. 10(b) of the Winding-up Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 296. The trial judge dismissed the petition. The Court of Appeal reversed this judgment and ordered the winding-up of the company. The appellants, as owners of class \"B\" shares, were granted leave to appeal to this Court. The company moved to quash the appeal on the ground that there was no amount involved as required by s. 108 of the Winding-up Act.\nHeld: The motion to quash should be dismissed.\nThe test to be applied in determining whether there is an amount involved in a proposed appeal exceeding $2,000 as required by s. 108, is that set out in the case of Orpen v. Roberts et al., [1925] S.C.R. 364. Applying that test to the present case, the evidence showed that if the winding-up proceeds, the loss for the appellants will be greatly in excess of $2,000. There was, therefore, involved in this appeal an amount exceeding $2,000.\nMOTION to quash an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, reversing a judgment of McLennan J. and ordering the winding-up of the respondent company. Motion dismissed.\nHon. R. L. Kellock, Q.C., and D. J. Wright, for the motion.\nJ. T. Weir, Q.C., contra.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014This is a motion on behalf of United Fuel Investments Limited, hereinafter referred to as \"the Company\", to quash an appeal to this Court brought by George Arthur Fallis and Donald Mackay Deacon from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario2, made on December 14, 1961, setting aside an order of McLennan J., made on July 31, 1961, and ordering that the Company be wound up under the provisions of the Winding-up Act. The appeal is brought pursuant to leave granted by my brother Judson on March 16, 1962.\nThe application before McLennan J. was made on the petition of the company pursuant to s. 10(6) of the Winding-up Act which reads:\n10. The Court may make a winding-up order,\n* * * (b) where the company at a special meeting of share-holders called for the purpose has passed a resolution requiring the company to be wound up;\nMcLennan J. ordered that the petition be dismissed with costs.\nThe order granting leave to appeal was made pursuant to s. 108 of the Winding-up Act which reads:\n108. An appeal, if the amount involved therein exceeds two thousand dollars, lies by leave of a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada to that Court from the highest court of final resort in or for the province or territory in which the proceeding originated.\nThe sole ground on which the motion to quash is based is set out in the notice of motion as follows:\nthat the Court has no Jurisdiction to hear the appeal because there is no amount involved therein as required by Section 108 of the Winding-up Act.\nThe company was incorporated by Letters Patent issued under the Companies Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 27, on March 30, 1928. By Supplementary Letters Patent issued on February 7, 1939, an arrangement made between the company and the holders of its preferred shares and the holders of its common shares was confirmed and the capital of the company was declared to consist of 90,000 cumulative Redeemable Class \"A\" Preference shares of the par value of $50 each, 90,000 non-cumulative Class \"B\" Preference shares of the par value of $25 each and 90,000 common shares without nominal or par value. The class \"B\" shares are not redeemable.\nIt is provided that subject to the rights of the holders of Class \"A\" Preference shares, the moneys of the company properly applicable to the payment of dividends which the directors may determine to distribute in any fiscal year of the company by way of dividends shall be distributed among the holders of the Class \"B\" Preference shares and the Common shares pro rata according to the number of shares held.\nIt is further provided that on the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the company the holders of Class \"B\" shares shall be entitled to the repayment of the amount paid up on such shares and if the winding-up be voluntary to an adidtional $5 per share.\nThe appellant Fallis has made an affidavit shewing that he is the owner of more than 1200 of the Class \"B\" Preference shares and expressing the opinion that but for the order winding-up the company the market price of the Class \"B\" shares would now exceed $80 per share. There is no contradiction of this evidence.\nIf the winding-up is carried out the holders of Class \"B\" Preference shares will receive $30 per share, as the winding-up is voluntary.\nIn my opinion the test to be applied in determining whether there is an amount involved in the proposed appeal exceeding $2000 is that set out in the judgment of this Court in Orpen v. Roberts et al.3, upholding the judgment of the Registrar affirming jurisdiction. The action was for an injunction to restrain the defendant from erecting a building nearer to the street line than 25 feet and to restrain the municipality from granting a permit for the erection of the proposed building. The report at page 367 reads as follows:\nThe Court said the subject matter of the appeal is the right of the respondent to build on the street line on Carlton street in the city of Toronto. \"The amount or value of the matter in controversy\" (section 40) is the loss which the granting or refusal of that right would entail. The evidence sufficiently shows that the loss\u2014and therefore the amount or value in controversy\u2014exceeds $2,000.\nApplying this test to the facts of the case at bar, the evidence shows that if the winding-up proceeds the appellant Fallis will suffer a loss greatly in excess of $2000. Indeed this would still be so if for Mr. Fallis' estimated figure of $80 were substituted that of $42 which was the lowest price at which the class \"B\" shares sold on the Toronto Stock Exchange during 1959, the year prior to the one in which the proceedings looking to the winding-up of the company were commenced.\nAmongst other cases, counsel for the applicant relied on Cushing Sulphite-Fibre Co. v. Cushing4, the head-note of which reads as follows:\nHeld, that a judgment refusing to set aside a winding-up order does not involve any amount and leave to appeal therefrom cannot be granted.\nAs is pointed out in the judgment of the learned Registrar in Orpen v. Roberts, supra, cases on this point decided prior to the passing, in 1913, of 3-4 Geo. V., c. 51, s. 5, must be reconsidered in the light of that amendment, by which the predecessor of what is now s. 43 of the Supreme Court Act was first enacted. The head-note quoted above reads as if the judgment lays down a general rule applicable to all appeals from a winding-up order; on reading the judgment, which was delivered by Sedgewick J., it is not clear whether that was the intention of the Court. At page 428 Sedgewick J. says:\nWe are, I think all of opinion that in the present case there is no amount involved.\nThe reasons are short; no mention is made of an affidavit made by Mr. Mariner Teed, of counsel for the appellant company, which is among the original papers on the files of the Court in which he deposes that the amount involved in the said winding-up order and in the appeal sought to be taken to the Supreme Court of Canada \"exceeds two thousand dollars and exceeds one hundred thousand dollars\".\nThis affidavit does not give any particulars or say who stands to gain or lose any monetary amount from the result of the appeal, although the material in the appeal case would suggest that it was argued that the making of the winding-up order would cause a loss to the company and therefore to its creditors.\nThis case was, of course, decided prior to the 1913 amendment and in so far as it appears to lay down any principle contrary to that enunciated in Orpen v. Roberts, supra, it ought not to be followed.\nIn my opinion the material in the case at bar establishes that there is involved in the appeal an amount exceeding $2000.\nI would dismiss the motion with costs payable by the respondent to the appellants in any event of the appeal.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Wright & McTaggart, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Blake, Cassels & Graydon, Toronto.\n1 [1962] O.R. 162, 31 D.L.R.

The council of arbitration rendered its decision which included a formula consisting of the following three clauses:\nA partir de la date de ce contrat, l'employeur consent d'engager comme employ\u00e9 seulement les personnes qui donnent volontairement leur autorisation \u00e9crite et d\u00fbment sign\u00e9e, pour retenir sur leur salaire la cotisation syndicale qui est fix\u00e9e au montant de $2.50 par mois, pour la dur\u00e9e de la convention.\nIl est entendu que cette autorisation ne sera pas demand\u00e9e comme condition d'emploi, mais sera simplement la modalit\u00e9 pour d\u00e9frayer le maintien de l'agence n\u00e9gociatrice collective d\u00fbment certifi\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi des relations ouvri\u00e8res de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nSi l'employeur d\u00e9sire engager une personne qui ne consent pas, pour des raisons personnelles, \u00e0 donner l'autorisation \u00e9crite dont il est question au premier paragraphe, l'employeur pourra engager tel employ\u00e9, mais dans ce cas l'employeur sera tenu de payer lesdites cotisations en ajoutant le montant de ces cotisations aux argents per\u00e7us sous l'article 2, parag. 3.\nThe hospitals sought the annulment of these three clauses.

The defendant owned number 1529 immediately to the west, the fence between these two properties being common. The defendant also owned the immediate adjacent property to the west bearing number 1535. Prior to 1899 these three implacements belonged to one owner. This owner sold part of the lot to Mrs. C M who had houses 1525 and 1529 built. Under the deed of sale, provision was made for a passageway between the property remaining with the vendor and the property sold to the purchaser. Subsequently, Mrs. C M sold number 1525 to Miss A M. This deed contained no reference to the passageway. Later Mrs. C M sold number 1529 to B. This deed referred to the passageway for the use in common of the owners of numbers 1529 and 1535. A similar reference is contained in the subsequent deeds of conveyance of number 1529 up to and including the defendant's deed of acquisition. The plaintiff acquired number 1525 from the purchaser through Miss A M and his deed contained no reference to the passageway. There was no evidence that a gate in the dividing fence between numbers 1525 and 1529, which. has been in existence from and after 1914, had existed prior to that date.\nThe plaintiff instituted this action confessoire to obtain a declaration that number 1529 was charged with a servitude of passage in favour of number 1525 in order to reach the passageway over which the plaintiff also claimed to have a right of passage. The trial judge maintained the action. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe plaintiff has never acquired a servitude consisting in the right of passage over the land belonging to the defendant upon which the building number 1529 was erected. No servitude can be established without a title, and when the existence of a right of servitude is in doubt, that doubt must be resolved in favour of the servient land. The authorities under art. 556 of the Civil Code are clear that while the purchaser of a portion of the dominant land may have a right to exercise a servitude over the servient land, in common with his vendor, it does not follow that such purchaser is entitled to make use of his vendor's property in order to exercise such right. Moreover, when Mrs. C M sold number 1525, which was not contiguous to the passage, without referring to it, and without creating any additional servitude over the land retained by her, that sale had the effect of extinguishing any servitude which might have existed in favour of the part sold on that date. Furthermore, the mere existence since the year 1914 of a gate in the common fence was not sufficient to establish a servitude by destination under art. 551 of the Code and no such servitude was created.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Batshaw J. Appeal dismissed.\nPeter R. D. MacKell, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nH. L. Aronovitch, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment rendered by the Court of Queen's Bench2 which allowed respondent's appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court and dismissed appellant's action with costs, Bissonnette J. dissenting.\nThe facts which are fully set out in the judgments below are really not in dispute. Appellant is the owner of a property upon which is erected a building bearing civic number 1525 Sherbrooke Street West, in the city of Montreal. This property measures twenty feet in width, by a depth of approximately one hundred and fifty-eight feet.\nRespondent is owner of the property immediately to the west of appellant's property, with a building erected thereon bearing civic number 1529 Sherbrooke Street West, the easterly wall of which is mitoyen with appellant, the said property measuring thirty-six feet in width, by approximately one hundred and fifty feet in depth. Respondent is also the owner of the immediately adjacent property to the west, measuring twenty-seven feet in width by approximately one hundred and thirty feet in depth, upon which is erected the building bearing civic number 1535 Sherbrooke Street West.\nPrior to April 5, 1899 these three emplacements\u2014all of which are unsubdivided parts of original lot 1728 on the Official Plan and Book of Reference of St-Antoine Ward\u2014belonged to one Thomas Collins. For purposes of convenience, I shall hereafter refer to the three properties in question by the present civic numbers of the buildings erected thereon. By Deed of Sale executed April 5, 1899, before W. de M. Marler, notary, the said Thomas Collins sold to Mrs. C. J. McCuaig the vacant land upon which the buildings bearing civic numbers 1525 and 1529 Sherbrooke Street West are now located. Under the said deed, provision was made for a passageway nine feet in width by seventy-five feet in depth running back from Sherbrooke Street, between the properties of the vendor and purchaser, the clause providing for such passage reading as follows:\nA strip of land of four feet six inches, English measure, off the South West side of the said sold property by a depth of about seventy-five feet from the said Sherbrooke Street, with a similar strip of like width and depth off the adjoining property, belonging to the Vendor, forms a passage of nine feet, English measure, in width, for the use in common of the property now sold and the property of the said Vendor, and the said passage is to be kept, used and maintained as such by the Purchaser & by the said Vendor their respective heirs & assigns forever.\nThe Purchaser will have the right to place openings on the said passage for light.\nSome time prior to the 21st of April 1902 Mrs. McCuaig appears to have built the two houses now bearing civic nos. 1525 and 1529, and on that date by deed before E. H. Stuart, notary, she sold no. 1525 to a Miss Agnes McDougall. This deed contained no reference to the passage in question.\nOn August 31, 1911, by deed before H. M. Marier, notary, Mrs. McCuaig sold no. 1529 to W. A. Black. This deed does refer to the said passage and, after describing it, goes on to say:\nfor the use in common of the piece of land now sold and the property of the said George H. Smithers, which passage is to be kept, used and maintained as such by the purchaser and the said Henry James Taylor (previously mentioned as being the owner of No. 1535) their respective heirs and assigns forever, the owners of either side of the said passage having the right to place openings on the said passage for light.\nA similar reference is contained in the subsequent deeds of conveyance of no. 1529 up to and including respondent's deed of acquisition.\nOn May 3, 1945, by deed before Lucien Morin, notary, appellant acquired no. 1525 from Chas. M. Black and this deed states that Mr. Black had acquired the property from Miss McDougall on November 20, 1920, by deed before J. A. Cameron, notary. Appellant's deed of acquisition from Charles Black contains no reference to the passageway. The only other facts to which reference need be made are that from and after 1914 a gate appears to have existed in the mitoyen fence separating the rear parts of no. 1525 and no. 1529. The Court below found that there is no evidence to establish the existence of such a gate prior to 1914 and I am in agreement with that finding. It also appears to be common ground that Charles M. Black was a son of W. A. Black and that for some considerable time after 1920 there was a close family relationship between the owners of no. 1525 and no. 1529.\nThe present action confessoire was taken by appellant to obtain a declaration that respondent's property, no. 1529 Sherbrooke Street West, was charged with a servitude of passage in favour of appellant's property no. 1525 in order to reach the nine foot lane over which appellant also claims to have a right of passage.\nNo servitude can be established without a title, and possession even immemorial is insufficient for that purpose (art. 549 C.C.). The fact that over a period of years a gate existed in the fence between no. 1529 and no. 1525, and that the occupants of no. 1525 crossed the rear of no. 1529 to reach the nine foot passage, does not create any presumption that they did so in virtue of a servitude. It is obvious that the existence of a right of passage, such as that claimed by appellant, would preclude the owner of no. 1529 from building on the rear part of his land, while the owner of no. 1525 would suffer no such limitation on his rights as owner. One is never presumed to have created a servitude upon one's property and when the existence of a right of servitude is in doubt, that doubt must be resolved in favour of the servient land\u2014Cross v. Judah3; Coulombe v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Coop\u00e9rative Agricole de Montmorency4, per Rinfret C.J.\nBasing his claim however upon the sale made by Mrs. McCuaig to his auteur Miss McDougall, appellant's contention is that he is entitled to a servitude consisting in the right of passage over the land belonging to respondent in order to exercise a right of passage in the nine-foot lane above referred to, by reason of the provisions of art. 556 C.C. which reads:\nIf the land in favor of which a servitude has been established come to be divided, the servitude remains due for each portion, without however the condition of the servient land being rendered worse. Thus in the case of a right of way, all the co-proprietors have a right to exercise it, but they are obliged to do so over the same portion of ground.\nArticle 556 C.C. is in virtually the same terms as art. 700 of the Code Napol\u00e9on and decisions of the French courts and comments of the French authors are therefore applicable. From these authorities it is clear that in France the principle enunciated in art. 700 C.N. applies only to the rights of the owner (or owners) of the dominant land over the servient land, and that while the purchaser of a portion of the dominant land may have a right to exercise the servitude over the servient land, in common with his vendor, it does not follow that such purchaser is entitled to make use of his vendor's property in order to exercise such right. Demolombe t. 12, Des servitudes (2), p. 372, no. 865; Baudry-Lacantinerie, Trait\u00e9 de Droit Civil, t. VI, p. 871; Tribunal Civil Seine, 9 juillet 1900, Gazette du Palais, Table Quinquennale 1897 \u00e0 1902, p. 580; Pandectes Fran\u00e7ais, R\u00e9pertoire: t. 51, p. 686.\nThe law in the Province of Quebec as to the interpretation and effect of art. 556 C.C. is similar to the law in France and I am in agreement with the view expressed by the majority in the Court below that appellant has never acquired & servitude consisting in the right of passage over the land belonging to respondent, upon which the building bearing civic no. 1529 Sherbrooke Street West is erected.\nMoreover, as I have stated, no. 1529 was built by Mrs. McCuaig along the line of the passage and extended back a distance of some sixteen feet beyond the end of that passage. She later sold no. 1525, which is not contiguous to the passage, without referring to it, and without creating any additional servitude over the land retained by her. In my opinion this sale had the effect of extinguishing any servitude which prior to April 21, 1902, may have existed in favour of the part sold on that date to Miss McDougall. Gosselin v. Charpentier5.\nNeither the learned trial judge nor Bissonnette J. were of the view that appellant was entitled to benefit from the provisions of art. 556 C.C. Both learned judges appear to have held that a servitude by destination under art. 551 C.C. had been established. The mere existence since the year 1914 of a gate in the mitoyen fence between no. 1525 and no. 1529 is not sufficient to establish a servitude by destination and I agree with the finding of the Court below that no such servitude was created.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, appellant: Walker, Chauvin, Walker, Allison, Beaulieu & Tetley, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: Chait & Aronovitch, Montreal.\n1 [1961] Que.

W was killed when driving alone and when, after swerving back and forth across the highway a number of times, his car left the road and collided with a tree. The policy excluded indemnity in the event that the insured was \"in a state of intoxication\" or if the death was caused \"by disease or natural causes\". The defendant company denied liability on the ground that the accident occurred whilst W was in a state of intoxication within the meaning of the policy. The evidence disclosed that W had been drinking about an hour previously and a blood test made three days after the death disclosed a high content of alcohol. The trial judge maintained the action and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. The defendant company appealed to this Court and a further ground of appeal was based on an observation made by Owen J. of the Court of Queen's Bench that the deceased might have felt \"faint or ill' which would mean that the death was caused \"by disease or natural causes\".\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe circumstances of this accident were not sufficient to discharge the burden assumed by the defendant of proving by a predonderance of evidence that W was in a state of intoxication or that his death was caused or contributed to by disease or natural causes, nor was there any evidence as to his behaviour on that day which would make such a conclusion any more probable. There were concurrent findings on the question of fact as to whether W was intoxicated or not, and these findings should not be disturbed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Demers J. Appeal dismissed.\nL. P. de Grandpr\u00e9, Q.C., and Guy Gilbert, for the defendant, appellant.\nHazen Hansard, Q.C., for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench of the Province of Quebec2 (Tremblay C.J. and Choquette J. dissenting) dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Demers J. of the Superior Court for the District of Montreal which had maintained the respondent's action against the appellant for $25,000 in respect of the accidental death of Mr. Ronald J. Williams, one of the respondent's senior employees, who was an \"Insured Person\" under the provisions of a Travel Accident Insurance Policy issued by the appellant to the respondent as the \"Insured\". The policy in question provided, inter alia, that:\nThe Company hereby agrees to make to the Insured, payments as detailed hereunder when any Insured Person sustains bodily injuries (here inafter referred to as \"such injuries\") caused solely by accidental means and resulting directly and independently of all other causes from the said accidental means \u2026\n* * *\nUnless endorsed hereon by the Company to the contrary, this Policy does not cover death, injury or disablement:\n(3) Directly or indirectly caused or contributed to by intentional selfinjury, by disease or natural causes, by suicide or attempted suicide (whether felonious or not), by provoked assault, by dueling or by fighting (except in bona fide self-defense).\n* * * (5) Resulting from the Insured Person's own criminal act or from bodily injury occasioned or occurring whilst he is in a state of insanity (temporary or otherwise) or intoxication.\nMr. Williams was killed as the result of an accident which occurred at 6:35 p.m. on July 22, 1956, while he was driving alone to the Dorval Airport, and when, after swerving back and forth across the highway a number of times, his car left the right-hand side of C\u00f4te de Liesse Road and collided with a large tree.\nIn view of the nature of the accident and the evidence that the deceased had had two 1\u00bd-oz. drinks of whisky about an hour previously and that a blood test made three days after the death purported to disclose a finding of 2.3 parts per 1000 by weight of alcohol in the deceased's blood, the appellant company denied liability on the ground that the accident occurred whilst Mr. Williams was \"in a state of \u2026 intoxication\" within the meaning of exclusion 5 of the policy.\nIn the course of his reasons for judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench, Owen J. observed that the accident was consistent with explanations other than intoxication, saying, inter alia, that \"Williams might have felt faint or ill \u2026\", and it is in relation to this observation that the appellant invokes exclusion 3 on the ground that such an explanation would mean that the death was caused \"by disease or natural causes\" and that it was, therefore, an event for which no indemnity was provided by the policy.\nIn light of all the evidence, I do not think that the circumstances of this accident are sufficient to discharge the burden assumed by the appellant of proving by a preponderance of evidence that Mr. Williams was in a state of intoxication or that his death was caused or contributed to by disease or natural causes, nor do I think that there was any evidence as to his behaviour on the day of his death which would make such a conclusion any more probable.\nThe remarkable feature of this case, however, is that although Mr. Williams was said to be \"perfectly normal\" an hour before death after having had two drinks of whisky, the blood test made three days later is consistent with his having consumed the equivalent of approximately 16 ounces of whisky during the day of his death. If no evidence had been tendered to explain this anomalous result, it would unquestionably have supported the theory that the deceased, in some unexplained manner, had consumed enough additional alcohol between 5:25 and 6:35 p.m. to induce a state of intoxication in the average man. The evidence of Dr. Rabinovitch which appears to have been accepted by the learned trial judge and the majority of the judges of the Court of Queen's Bench was, however, to the effect that in the particular circumstances of this case the appearance of the presence of indicia of high alcoholic content in the blood disclosed by the test was probably due to natural processes operating after death and that the result of that test was not to be relied upon as indicating the amount of alcohol consumed by Williams.\nThe conclusion reached by both of the Courts below is, in my view, succinctly stated by Mr. Justice Owen in the last paragraph of his reasons for judgment where he says:\n\u2026 I would conclude that the Appellant did not discharge the burden imposed by the civil law of proving according to the balance of probabilities that Williams was intoxicated at the time of the accident which caused his death and I would dismiss the present appeal with costs.\nThe question of whether Mr. Williams was intoxicated or not is a question of fact, and as the learned trial judge and the majority of the Court of Queen's Bench are in agreement with respect to that question, I cannot express my opinion in more apt words than those employed by Taschereau J. in American Automobile Insurance Company v. Dickson3, where he said:\nAlthough I have been impressed by the able arguments of counsel for the appellant, I feel it impossible to hold that intoxication was sufficiently proven, without violating the well-known rule established before this Court by a long series of judicial pronouncement, and which is that \"concurrent findings\" should not be disturbed, unless they cannot be supported by the evidence.\nI would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the defendant, appellant: Tansey, de Grandpr\u00e9, de Grandpr\u00e9, Bergeron & Monet, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, respondent: Common, Howard, Cate, Ogilvy, Bishop & Cope, Montreal.\n1 [1962] Que.

The car in which the plaintiff was a passenger was travelling in a southerly direction and the defendant's car was travelling in an easterly direction. The collision occurred in the City of Montreal at the southwest portion of an unprotected intersection. Speed was not a determining cause of the accident. The trial judge maintained the action against the defendant. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nPursuant to s. 83 of By-law No. 1319. of the City of Montreal, which applies to this case, the driver of the car in which the plaintiff was a passenger had to give the right-of-way to the other car and his failure to do so was the sole determining cause of the collision.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Tellier J.

Cette voiture se dirigeait dans une direction nord-sud sur la rue Fulford et, en arrivant \u00e0 l'intersection de la rue Workman, elle vint en collision avec celle de Ren\u00e9 Bourbonnais et conduite par son fils mineur Roland Bourbonnais.\nByers subit des dommages s\u00e9rieux et institua une action au montant de $45,274.14 contre Paul Desmarchais, Jean Desmarchais et Ren\u00e9 Bourbonnais, ce dernier tant personnellement qu'en sa qualit\u00e9 de tuteur \u00e0 son enfant mineur Roland Bourbonnais qui conduisait la voiture. Il a conclu \u00e0 ce que les d\u00e9fendeurs soient condamn\u00e9s conjointement et solidairement \u00e0 payer le montant des dommages subis.\nM. le Juge Edouard Tellier de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure a rejet\u00e9 l'action du demandeur contre le d\u00e9fendeur Jean Desmarchais, mais l'a accueillie contre Ren\u00e9 Bourbonnais conjointement et solidairement en sa qualit\u00e9 de tuteur \u00e0 son fils mineur Roland, et aussi personnellement. Le montant accord\u00e9 en Cour sup\u00e9rieure a \u00e9t\u00e9 de $19,274.14.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur Bourbonnais a inscrit cette cause en appel devant la Cour du banc de la reine2, tant personnellement qu'en sa qualit\u00e9 de tuteur \u00e0 son enfant mineur, et son appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenu de sorte qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de toute responsabilit\u00e9 comme cons\u00e9quence de cet accident. Devant la pr\u00e9sente Cour, l'appelant Byers demande de faire r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. En ce qui concerne Paul Desmarchais, le juge au proc\u00e8s, malgr\u00e9 qu'il reconnaisse la responsabilit\u00e9 de ce dernier, affirme avec raison qu'aucune condamnation ne peut \u00eatre rendue contre lui parce que, devant la Cour sup\u00e9rieure, la cause n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrite sur le r\u00f4le que quant \u00e0 Bourbonnais seulement. Il appert en outre que Paul Desmarchais, au cours de l'instance, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 en faillite.\nLa preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'\u00e0 l'intersection des rues Fulford et Workman, il n'y a aucun signal d'arr\u00eat; que le soir de cet accident la voiture de Desmarchais circulait \u00e0 environ 15 milles \u00e0 l'heure, et qu'en s'approchant de l'intersection, Bourbonnais qui circulait \u00e0 environ 25 milles \u00e0 l'heure, a substantiellement r\u00e9duit sa vitesse. Les deux voitures sont arriv\u00e9es \u00e0 l'intersection \u00e9videmment en m\u00eame temps et la collision a eu lieu dans la partie sud-ouest des rues Fulford et Workman.\nL'article 83 du r\u00e8glement municipal no 1319 de la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, relativement \u00e0 la circulation dans les limites de la ville, doit recevoir son application. Cet article est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans les termes suivants:\nAux crois\u00e9es non prot\u00e9g\u00e9es, la personne qui conduit un v\u00e9hicule sur une rue ou voie publique est tenue de c\u00e9der le passage \u00e0 la personne qui conduit un v\u00e9hicule qui vient \u00e0 sa droite sur l'autre rue ou voie publique. Il s'agissait l\u00e0 d'une crois\u00e9e non prot\u00e9g\u00e9e et, par cons\u00e9quent, en vertu des termes m\u00eames du r\u00e8glement, qu'on ne peut \u00e9videmment pas mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9, Desmarchais qui a vu Bourbonnais venir \u00e0 sa droite, devait lui c\u00e9der le droit de passage.\nJe crois que les deux conducteurs conduisaient \u00e0 des vitesses raisonnables. A l'approche de l'intersection, il y eut de part et d'autre un moment d'h\u00e9sitation, mais il appartenait alors \u00e0 Desmarchais, conducteur b\u00e9n\u00e9vole de la voiture dans laquelle se trouvait Byers, de c\u00e9der la route \u00e0 Bourbonnais qui s'avan\u00e7ait \u00e0 sa droite. Comme le dit M. le Juge Owen qui a \u00e9crit le jugement de la Cour, et je m'accorde avec lui,\nThe evidence accepted by the learned trial judge is that Bourbonnais before he came to the intersection and before he applied the brakes was travelling at a speed of 25 m.p.h. In my opinion this is not a case where speed was a determining cause of the accident. On the evidence there is, in my opinion, no basis for holding that Bourbonnais abused his right of way.\nOn the facts found by the learned trial judge I conclude that the sole determining cause of this accident was the negligence of Paul Desmarchais in failing to respect the right of way of the automobile driven by Roland Bourbonnais which was coming from Desmarchais' right.\nJ'en viens donc \u00e0 la conclusion que le jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine est bien fond\u00e9 et qu'il n'y a pas lieu pour cette Cour d'intervenir.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the plaintiff, appellant: Hackett, Mulvena, Drummond & Fiske, Montreal.\nAttorneys for the defendant, respondent: Filion, Badeaux & Beland, Montreal.\n1 [1962] Que.

Some seven months later the lessee learned that in fact the garage had shown a loss in each of the previous six years. The lessee instituted this action in annulment on the ground of false representation. The defense pleaded that the representations, if they had been made, were not fraudulent and that in any event the lessee had ratified the contract. The trial judge dismissed the action. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench. The lessor appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The lessee was entitled to annulment of the lease.\nThe representations which had induced the signing of the lease justified the granting of the annulment. Ratification is never to be presumed. The lessee realized only gradually that he had been defrauded. Once it was established that the lessee had been induced by false representation to sign the lease, the onus was on the defendant to prove ratification. In the circumstances of this case that onus was not discharged. Lortie v.

C'\u00e9tait une exploitation d'assez grande importance.

En plus, le 28 juin 1957 il consentit une hypoth\u00e8que continue pour garantir ses paiements futurs.\nApr\u00e8s avoir pris possession de l'\u00e9tablissement le 1er juillet 1957, Tremblay r\u00e9alisa graduellement que les faits qu'on lui avait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s paraissaient \u00eatre loin de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, mais pour s'en assurer davantage il exploita le commerce jusqu'au d\u00e9but de f\u00e9vrier 1958.\nA une date que la preuve ne pr\u00e9cise pas, mais qui serait vers janvier 1958, Tremblay apprit que Lefran\u00e7ois lui avait cach\u00e9 un fait essentiel, \u00e0 savoir que l'exploitation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9ficitaire pendant les six derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, et par l'entremise de son avocat, il en avisa l'appelante par lettre le 24 janvier 1958.\nAu d\u00e9but de mars 1958 Tremblay intenta la pr\u00e9sente action en r\u00e9siliation des contrats ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9s pour cause de dol et de fausses repr\u00e9sentations.\nL'appelante a plaid\u00e9, en substance, que si les repr\u00e9sentations ci-dessus avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, elles devaient recevoir le sens \u00abd'une simple possibilit\u00e9 de revenus futurs\u00bb. Elle ajouta que par ses agissements l'intim\u00e9 avait ratifi\u00e9 le contrat et qu'il s'\u00e9tait plaint tardivement.\nLa d\u00e9fense fut maintenue par la cour de premi\u00e8re instance, qui statua que l'appelante avait simplement exalt\u00e9 la valeur du commerce, qu'elle n'avait employ\u00e9 aucun moyen coupable, car \u00abune r\u00e9ticence, m\u00eame par le silence, n'\u00e9quivaut pas \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e qu'\u00e9veille l'expression de man\u0153uvre\u00bb. La Cour, de plus, a accueilli la d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur l'acquiescement au contrat.\nL'appel des intim\u00e9s fut maintenu par un jugement majoritaire2, les juges Bissonnette et Badeaux dissidents. Le bail et l'acte d'hypoth\u00e8que ont \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9s et l'appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 payer au demandeur une somme de $7,420.59. Le juge Bissonnette \u00e9tait d'avis qu'il y a eu dol de la part du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de l'appelante, mais qu'il y a eu aussi ratification et acquiescement de la part de feu Lorenzo Tremblay. Le juge Badeaux \u00e9tait aussi d'avis que par ses actes et agissements Tremblay a confirm\u00e9 le contrat.\nLes deux questions en litige dans le pr\u00e9sent appel sont les suivantes:\n1. Y a-t-il eu dol de la part de l'appelante?\n2. En d\u00e9pit du dol, feu Lorenzo Tremblay a-t-il ratifi\u00e9 le contrat?\nLa Cour d'Appel a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que Tremblay n'aurait jamais sign\u00e9 le bail et l'hypoth\u00e8que ci-dessus relat\u00e9s, s'il avait su que l'appelante n'avait pu op\u00e9rer le garage avec profit pendant les six ou sept ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, et que les repr\u00e9sentations faites par Lefran\u00e7ois justifiaient la demande de la r\u00e9siliation du contrat par Tremblay.\nJe suis d'avis que la preuve confirme cette conclusion qui ne doit pas \u00eatre renvers\u00e9e.\nIl reste la question de ratification. Tel qu'indiqu\u00e9 par M. le Juge Hyde dans la Cour du banc de la reine, il est important de reconna\u00eetre que cette action n'est pas une action r\u00e9dhibitoire soumise \u00e0 la disposition de l'art. 1530 du Code Civil, et cette distinction est discut\u00e9e par mon coll\u00e8gue, M. le Juge Taschereau, dans la cause de Lortie v. Bouchard3, o\u00f9 il dit:\nJe ne crois pas qu'il y ait eu acceptation de l'\u00e9tat de choses par le demandeur, ni que son action soit tardive. Il est entendu, et la jurisprudence reconna\u00eet bien le principe que lorsqu'il s'agit d'une demande en annulation de contrat pour vices cach\u00e9s de la chose, l'article 1530 C.C. doit trouver son application, et l'action doit n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre institu\u00e9e avec diligence raisonnable. Mais la r\u00e8gle a moins de rigueur quand il s'agit de fausses repr\u00e9sentations, et la m\u00eame c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9 n'est pas une condition essentielle \u00e0 la r\u00e9ussite de l'action. Ce n'est que graduellement que Tremblay a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tromp\u00e9 par le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de l'appelante. D'apr\u00e8s la preuve, c'est au cours de janvier 1958 que Tremblay a su pour la premi\u00e8re fois que les op\u00e9rations du garage avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9ficitaires au cours des six ann\u00e9es qui pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e8rent la signature de son bail. Il est vrai que dans le mois d'octobre Tremblay s'est rendu compte qu'il \u00e9tait incapable de conduire son entreprise avec profit. Il a consult\u00e9 son avocat qui lui a conseill\u00e9 de t\u00e2cher d'am\u00e9liorer l'efficacit\u00e9 de son op\u00e9ration. C'est \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque qu'il a discut\u00e9 de l'affaire avec le g\u00e9rant-g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'appelante et que celui-ci l'a assur\u00e9 qu'avec une administration plus efficace il pourrait op\u00e9rer avec profit.\nLa ratification ne se pr\u00e9sume jamais et nul n'est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 renoncer \u00e0 un droit. Aussit\u00f4t qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que Tremblay avait \u00e9t\u00e9 induit \u00e0 signer le contrat comme cons\u00e9quence des fausses repr\u00e9sentations faites par le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de l'appelante, le fardeau de la preuve reposait sur l'appelante d'\u00e9tablir telle ratification. Dans les circonstances que la preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le, je partage l'opinion exprim\u00e9e par la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du banc de la reine que l'appelante n'a pas \u00e9tabli sa d\u00e9fense de ratification et d'acquiescement.\nA l'audience la question fut soulev\u00e9e par la Cour, concernant sa juridiction d'entendre l'appel. Dans son action, Tremblay r\u00e9clamait des montants s'\u00e9levant \u00e0 un total de $14,231.97. Le jugement de la Cour du banc de la reine lui a allou\u00e9 $7,420.59, mais en tenant compte d'une somme de $4,269.41 dont Tremblay \u00e9tait redevable \u00e0 l'appelante ce montant a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9duit par la Cour. Dans les circonstances, l'appelante a fait une motion \u00e0 cette Cour pour une permission sp\u00e9ciale d'appeler, et cette motion a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e sans frais.\nPour les raisons que je viens de donner, aussi bien que pour celles de M. le Juge Hyde, avec qui je suis d'accord, l'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the defendant, appellant: Tratte, Cot\u00e9, Tremblay & D\u00e9ch\u00eane, Quebec.\nAttorney for the plaintiff, respondent: I.

The respondent company was the owner of a parcel of land on which it had a restaurant and an administration building, together with parking areas, tennis courts and bowling greens. The company proposed to build a motel on a certain part of its holding. In January 1956 a meeting was held with the municipality to discuss the project, and, as the building would require a change in existing zoning regulations, it was suggested that the respondent make a formal application for such rezoning; however an application was not made. On August 20, 1958, the appellant conservation authority expropriated a portion of the respondent\u2019s lands, thereby making the erection of the proposed motel impossible. The municipality had passed a by-law on November 5, 1956, which prohibited the erection of buildings or structures for residential or commercial purposes in an area including the lands in question. This by-law was approved for a period ending June 15, 1957; there was no application for extension of the approval, nor was the by-law repealed. Another zoning by-law similar to the one of November 5, 1956, was passed on May 4, 1959.\nThe respondent claimed $85,500 as compensation; the appellant\u2019s expropriation advisory board recommended an amount of $2,700. The Ontario Municipal Board fixed the compensation at $3,370.40, but added nothing on the ground of possible rezoning. The respondent obtained leave to appeal upon certain questions of law and jurisdiction and the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, ordering that the compensation be increased to $77,313. The appellant in appealing to this Court questioned the correctness of the answers made by the Court of Appeal and submitted that, in any event, that Court had no jurisdiction to determine the amount of compensation to be awarded.\nHeld (Judson J. dissenting in part): The appeal should be allowed and the matter returned to the Municipal Board to be dealt with in accordance with the answers, as set out in the judgment of the majority of this Court, to the questions upon which leave to appeal was granted.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright, Fauteux and Martland JJ.: The Judicature Act by s. 26(2) provided that \u201cthe Court of Appeal also has jurisdiction as provided by any Act of the Parliament of Canada or of the Legislature\u201d, but did not enlarge the jurisdiction conferred upon that Court by s. 22(10) of The Conservation Authorities Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 62, as amended, and by s. 98(1), (3) and (7) of The Ontario Municipal Board Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 262, as amended. No authority was found in The Conservation Authorities Act or The Ontario Municipal Board Act to give a judgment but only an opinion on a question of jurisdiction or law, which opinion was directed to be acted upon by the Board, who \u201cshall make an order in accordance with such opinion\u201d. This required the opinion of the Court of Appeal to be applied and made effective by an order of the Board.\nAccordingly, the Court of Appeal did not have jurisdiction to determine the amount of compensation payable to the respondent. It also appeared that in arriving at the figure which it fixed the Court of Appeal drew an inference or made a finding of fact inconsistent, and indeed, directly at variance, with the finding of fact expressly made by the Board, \u201cthat there was not a reasonable probability of the desired zoning being realized\u201d. Re Hollinger Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd. and Township of Tisdale, [1931] O.R. 640, distinguished; Re Bloor Street Widening (1925-26), 58 O.L.R. 230 and 511, discussed; Re Casa Loma (1927-28), 61 O.L.R. 187, referred to.\nThe most important factor in deciding the amount of compensation in this case was the probability or improbability of the respondent being able to have its lands rezoned to permit the erection of apartment houses. Whether such a probability existed at the date of the expropriation and, if it did exist, its degree were both questions of fact on which the decision of the Board was final unless in arriving at its decision it erred in some matter of law. The inquiry as to whether it had so erred was not at large but was limited to a consideration of the questions on which leave to appeal was granted.\n(1) The Board erred in law in directing itself that the effect of the by-law passed on November 5, 1956, was to require the compensation for the lands expropriated to be fixed on the assumption that they were an entity separate from the remainder of the lands of the owner and that the owner could never acquire or use them.\n(2) The Board did not err in considering the effect of the similar by-law passed on May 4, 1959. It referred to it only as showing that its conclusion reached on the circumstances at the date of the expropriation had received subsequent confirmation.\n(3) Nor did the Board err in considering and making findings with respect to the state of mind of the municipality and the conservation authority.\n(4) There was evidence upon which the Board could presume that the planning board of the municipality would consult with the conservation authority prior to dealing with applications before it for rezoning.\n(5) The Board did not err in law in giving effect to that presumption.\n(6) Assuming this to be a matter of law, there was evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding that in the opinion of the planning director of the municipality the highest and best use of the respondent\u2019s top lands would be a public use.\nPer Judson J., dissenting: The Board did not err in considering the effect of the by-law passed on November 5, 1956. It found \u201cthat there was no reasonable probability of the desired zoning being realized\u201d. If the reasons of the Board were taken as a whole, the mention of severance did not mean anything more than the lack of this reasonable probability of rezoning the whole area including the expropriated land. This was not error in law. The expropriated lands could only have value to the owner of the amount assigned to them by the respondent if they remained part of the whole and were rezoned.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal from an expropriation award by the Ontario Municipal Board. Appeal allowed, Judson J. dissenting in part.\nHon. R.L. Kellock, Q.C., and D.R. Walkinshaw, Q.C., for the appellant.\nJ.T. Weir, Q.C., and B.H. Kellock, for the respondent. The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Cartwright, Fauteux and Martland JJ. was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1, made on July 22, 1961, answering certain questions and ordering that the compensation allowed to the respondent for a portion of its lands expropriated by the appellant be increased from the sum of $3,370.40 fixed by the Ontario Municipal Board to the sum of $77,313. The appellant questions the correctness of the answers made by the Court of Appeal and submits that, in any event, that Court had no jurisdiction to determine the amount of compensation to be awarded.\nThe appellant is a corporate body created by chapter 9 of the Statutes of Ontario, 4-5 Elizabeth II, 1956, which amended The Conservation Authorities Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 62. Under clause (c) of s. 15 of the last mentioned Act the appellant had power to expropriate any land it might require for the purposes of carrying out a scheme under the Act. Pursuant to this power, on August 20, 1958, it expropriated 3.47 acres of land owned by the respondent.\nThe respondent claimed $85,500 as compensation. The Expropriation Advisory Board of the appellant, on December 12, 1958, recommended that the compensation be fixed at $2,700. The respondent served a notice of dissatisfaction and on August 26, 1960, the Ontario Municipal Board made an order fixing the compensation at $3,370.40 with interest at 5 per cent from the date of taking. On November 18, 1960, the Court of Appeal made an order giving the respondent leave to appeal to that Court \u201cupon the following questions of law and jurisdiction:\u2014\u201d\n1. Did the Ontario Municipal Board err in considering the effect of by-law 10370 of the Township of Etobicoke;\n2. Did the Ontario Municipal Board err in considering the effect of a by-law passed by the Township of Etobicoke on the 4th day of May, 1959;\n3. Did the Ontario Municipal Board err in considering and making findings with respect to the state of mind of the Municipal Corporation and the Conservation Authority; 4. Was there any evidence upon which the Ontario Municipal Board could presume that the Planning Board of the Township of Etobicoke would consult the Conservation Authority prior to dealing with any applications before it for re-zoning;\n5. If there was any such evidence, did the Ontario Municipal Board err in law in giving effect to that presumption;\n6. Did the Ontario Municipal Board err in failing to allow to the appellant damages claimed by reason of the proposed use of land of alleged higher value in place of the land expropriated for the purpose of carrying out the proposed undertaking of the appellant;\n7. Was there any evidence to support the finding of the Ontario Municipal Board that in the opinion of the Planning Director of the Township of Etobicoke the highest and best use of the appellant\u2019s top lands would be a public use.\nThe Court of Appeal on July 22, 1961, gave judgment directing that questions 1, 2, 3 and 5 be answered in the affirmative and that questions 4, 6 and 7 be answered in the negative and ordering that the compensation allowed the appellant pursuant to the order of the Ontario Municipal Board be increased to the sum of $77,313.\nPrior to the expropriation the respondent was the owner of 10.8 acres of land in the Township of Etobicoke bounded on the north by Old Mill Road, on the east by the Humber River, on the west by Humber Boulevard, and on the south by Bloor Street. The elevation of the respondent\u2019s land varies from approximately 252.5 feet above sea level at the bank of the Humber River to approximately 295 feet above sea level on the table-lands to the west of the valley.\nOf the total holding of 10.8 acres, 3.28 acres was occupied or used in conjunction with the existing buildings on the south side of Old Mill Road, described as the Old Mill Restaurant and the Administration Building used by the respondent and other tenants; of the remaining 7.52 acres, 2.6 acres was used for tennis courts and bowling greens; 1.45 acres was table-land referred to as park land; .85 acres was embankment; .9 acres was valley land being prepared for use as parking space and 1.72 acres was unused valley land. The 3.47 acres expropriated was made up of the .9 acres of valley land being prepared for parking space, .85 acres embankment land and 1.72 acres of unused valley land.\nSpeaking generally the valley land is that land reasonably flat in contour adjacent to the river, the embankment land is the portion between the top and the toe of the embankment rising steeply from the valley to the table-land and the table-land is that above and beyond the top of the embankment.\nParking accommodation for the occupants of the respondent\u2019s building and the guests of its restaurant was provided in three locations; a small area adjacent to the administration building accommodated 30 cars; a second area on the north side of the Old Mill Road accommodated 50 cars; an area on the south side of Old Mill Road to the east of the restaurant accommodated 140 cars. At the time of the expropriation a further area of .9 of an acre on the south side of Old Mill Road at the north-east corner of the respondent\u2019s lands was being prepared to accommodate 96 cars, the necessary filling having been completed to the extent of about 70 per cent.\nOn the west side of Humber Boulevard opposite to the respondent\u2019s land are \u201csixplexes\u201d and \u201ceightplexes\u201d. On the south side of Bloor Street opposite to the respondent\u2019s land apartment buildings have been erected. On the northwest corner of Humber Boulevard and Bloor Street there is a gasoline service station. On the north side of Old Mill Road opposite to the lands of the respondent are \u201cdouble-duplexes\u201d. There are no single family homes on Humber Boulevard between Bloor Street and Old Mill Road.\nOn April 4, 1955, the Township of Etobicoke passed by-law 9454, entitled \u201cRestricted Area (Zoning) By-Law of the Township of Etobicoke\u201d, under which the whole 10.8 acres of the respondent\u2019s lands formed part of Greenbelt Zone \u201cG\u201d. The use of lands in this zone for any business purpose is prohibited and the only residences permitted are one-family detached dwellings each with a minimum lot area of 1 acre. As the use made of the land by the respondent was in existence at the date of the by-law, it was a legal non-conforming use after the by-law was passed. In October 1955 the Committee of Adjustment of the Township of Etobicoke authorized an extension to the respondent\u2019s buildings by the addition of dining\u2011room space. In November 1955 the respondent had consulted architects with reference to a proposed motel along the crest of the bank. In the following month the architects submitted sketch plans for such a building extending over the edge of the embankment. In January 1956 representatives of the respondent met with members of the township planning board to discuss the proposed plan. As the proposed building would require a change in the existing green belt zoning, the board suggested that the respondent make a formal application for such rezoning accompanied by the data normally required in such applications.\nSubsequently the respondent did some soil sampling work; it received more detailed plans from its architects in May 1956 and some preliminary cost estimates from contractors in June or July of 1956. Nothing further was done by the respondent with regard to the project up to the date of the expropriation, and in particular no complete working drawings were produced, no application was made for a building permit and no application for rezoning was made.\nOn November 5, 1956, by-law 10370 was passed by the Township of Etobicoke prohibiting the erection of buildings or structures for residential or commercial purposes between the lines shown on maps attached to the by-law which ran approximately along the contour of 267.5 feet above sea level on either side of the Humber River. This by-law was approved by the order of the Ontario Municipal Board dated March 15, 1957, for a period ending June 15, 1957. The township did not apply for extension of this approval, nor was the by-law repealed.\nIn 1957 the appellant had prepared a scheme to acquire all the lands in the Lower Humber Valley from Dundas Street to the mouth of the Humber River, which include the lands here in question, in order to straighten the river bed and build works to prevent damaging floods such as were caused by Hurricane Hazel in October 1954. This scheme was approved by the Provincial Government and the member municipalities of the appellant, and the appellant began acquiring the lands in the valley for this purpose. It was in pursuance of this scheme that the lands of the respondent were expropriated on August 20, 1958. On May 4, 1959, the Township of Etobicoke passed by-law 11757, which was similar in terms to by-law 10370. The by-law was approved by the Municipal Board on October 13, 1959.\nThe Ontario Municipal Board based its award on a valuation of $739 per acre for the 3.47 acres taken (plus an allowance of $500 to cover the expenditure in preparing the .9 acres for parking and an additional 10 per cent for forcible taking). There was evidence to support the figure of $739 per acre, unless it should be held either (i) that the lands taken might have been rezoned to permit the erection of the proposed hotel building or (ii) that the \u201ctable-lands\u201d might have been rezoned to permit the erection of apartment houses. In the latter alternative the ownership of the lands taken would have added to the value of the \u201ctable-lands\u201d as, under the existing by-laws, the number of apartment suites which were permitted to be constructed on a parcel of land was proportional to the area of that parcel. It was stated in argument that had the table-lands been rezoned to permit the erection of apartments, the ownership of the expropriated lands would have permitted the building of seventy-six more suites than would be permitted lacking that ownership. I did not understand this statement to be challenged.\nThe Ontario Municipal Board came to the conclusion \u201cthat there was not a reasonable probability of the desired zoning being realized\u201d and added nothing to the compensation on the ground of possible rezoning.\nThe Court of Appeal was of opinion that if the respondent\u2019s lands were rezoned to permit the erection of apartment houses all of its lands except the .85 acres of the embankment would have a value of $40,000 per acre, but that this value should be discounted by 33\u2153 per cent because of the \u201cuncertainties and delays implicit in the necessity of obtaining appropriate re\u2011zoning\u201d.\nBefore turning to a consideration of the seven questions it will be convenient to consider the extent of the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal as our duty, if this appeal succeeds, is to give the judgment which that Court should have given. The limited right of appeal from the decision of the Ontario Municipal Board is set out in s. 22(10) of The Conservation Authorities Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 62, as amended by 1952, Statutes of Ontario, c. 11, s. 7. Subsection (10) reads as follows:\n(10) The Ontario Municipal Board shall have authority to determine the amount of compensation payable and its decision shall be final and shall not be open to appeal except that an appeal shall lie to the Court of Appeal upon a question of jurisdiction or upon a question of law in the manner and under the conditions set out in section 98 of The Ontario Municipal Board Act, and that section shall apply mutatis mutandis.\nThe relevant provisions of s. 98 of The Ontario Municipal Board Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 262, as amended by 1956, Statutes of Ontario, c. 60, s. 10, are subsections (1), (3) and (7) which read as follows:\n(1) Subject to the provisions of Part IV, an appeal shall lie from the Board to the Court of Appeal upon a question of jurisdiction or upon any question of law, but such appeal shall not lie unless leave to appeal is obtained from the Court within one month after the making of the order or decision sought to be appealed from or within such further time as the Court, under the special circumstances of the case, shall allow after notice to the opposite party stating the grounds of appeal.\n(3) On the hearing of any appeal the Court may draw all such inferences as are not inconsistent with the facts expressly found by the Board and are necessary for determining the question of jurisdiction or law, as the case may be, and shall certify its opinion to the Board and the Board shall make an order in accordance with such opinion.\n(7) Save as provided in this section and in sections 46 and 97,\n(a) every decision or order of the Board shall be final; and\n(b) no order, decision or proceeding of the Board shall be questioned or reviewed, restrained or removed by prohibition, injunction, certiorari or any other process or proceeding in any court.\nWith respect, I have reached the conclusion that, in the case at bar, the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to fix the amount of the compensation. The Judicature Act by s. 26(2) provides that \u201cthe Court of Appeal also has jurisdiction as provided by any Act of the Parliament of Canada or of the Legislature\u201d, but does not enlarge the jurisdiction conferred upon that Court by the provisions of The Conservation Authorities Act and The Ontario Municipal Board Act quoted above.\nIn supporting the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal Mr. Weir referred to the following two cases. Re Hollinger Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd. and Township of Tisdale[2] was a case in which the appeal from the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board was brought under s. 83 of The Assessment Act, R.S.O.1927, c. 238. Subsections (6) and (7) of that section read as follows:\n(6) An appeal shall lie from the decision of the Board under this section to a Divisional Court upon all questions of law or the construction of a statute, a municipal by-law, any agreement in writing to which the municipality concerned is a party, or any order of the Municipal Board.\n(7) The practice and procedure on the appeal to a Divisional Court shall be the same mutatis mutandis subject to any rule of court or regulation of the Board as upon an appeal from a county court.\nOwing to the difference in wording between those subsections and the ones with which we are concerned this decision is not of assistance.\nIn Re Bloor Street Widening[3], an appeal was brought from an order of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board permitting the City of Toronto to pass a by-law repealing an earlier expropriation by-law. The right of appeal was given by subsections (1) and (3) of section 48 of The Ontario Railway and Municipal Board Act, R.S.O. 1914, c. 186, the wording of which is as regards subs. (1) substantially and as regards subs. (3) exactly the same as that of subs. (1) and subs. (3) of s. 98 of The Ontario Municipal Board Act which I have quoted above. In the judgment of the Court of Appeal reported at p. 230 it was held by the majority of the Court that the sole question to be determined was one of law\u2014the true construction of a statutory provision\u2014that the Board had erred in its construction and that on the true construction the Board was without jurisdiction to make the order permitting the repeal. The reasons of the majority directed that the appeal be allowed with costs \u201chere and below\u201d. The report at p. 511 is that of the judgment of the Court of Appeal, similarly constituted, on a motion to vary the decision, reported at p. 230, by eliminating the part dealing with the costs before the Board upon the ground that these costs were in the discretion of the Board and the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction over them. The motion was dismissed, Hodgins and Ferguson JJ.A. dissenting. If it be assumed that the judgment of the majority was right, it decides that in a case where the decision of the question of jurisdiction or law submitted to the Court of Appeal, pursuant to subs. (1) and subs. (3) referred to above, of necessity disposes of the whole matter which was before the Board, the Court of Appeal can deal with the costs of the proceedings before the Board, and it does not appear to me to be of any great assistance to the respondent in the case before us. However, in my respectful opinion, the reasoning of Hodgins J.A. in his dissenting judgment, concurred in by Ferguson J.A., is to be preferred to that of the majority.\nBecause of differences in the names of the applicable statutes and in the numbering of sections, I shall, in the following paragraph, paraphrase, instead of quoting verbatim, the reasons of Hodgins J.A. at p. 515.\nBy s. 26(2) of The Judicature Act the Court of Appeal is given jurisdiction as provided by any act of the Legislature. It is under this section that an appeal from the Board is possible. To find what that jurisdiction is in this case one must go to The Conservation Authorities Act and The Ontario Municipal Board Act which determine the powers of the Court of Appeal in the matter. In these there is found no authority to give a judgment (to which s. 27 of The Judicature Act might well apply) but only an opinion on a question of jurisdiction or law, which opinion is directed to be acted upon by the Board, who \u201cshall make an order in accordance with such opinion\u201d. This requires the opinion of the Court of Appeal to be applied and made effective by an order of the Board.\nThis reasoning of Hodgins J.A. strengthens the opinion I have formed from a consideration of the wording of the applicable statutory provisions, all of which I have quoted, that the Court of Appeal did not have jurisdiction to determine the amount of compensation payable to the respondent. It would also appear that in arriving at the figure which it fixed the Court of Appeal drew an inference or made a finding of fact inconsistent, and indeed, directly at variance, with the finding of fact expressly made by the Board, \u201cthat there was not a reasonable probability of the desired zoning being realized\u201d. In the course of the argument reference was made to the following statement in the reasons of Middleton J.A. in Re Casa Loma[4]:\nThe motion before us is under sec. 48 of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board Act, R.S.O. 1914, ch. 186, which gives the right of appeal from the decision of the Board \u201cupon a question of jurisdiction or upon any question of law\u201d if leave is obtained from this Court.\nBefore we can grant leave we must determine whether the question which it is sought to argue upon the appeal falls within the statutory category and is a \u201cquestion of jurisdiction\u201d or \u201ca question of law\u201d, and our decision upon the question is final and cannot be reconsidered upon the argument of the appeal: Re Bloor Street Widening.\nThis statement was not necessary to the decision of the application and, with respect, I am of opinion that it is inaccurate. It is contrary to what was decided on this point in Re Bloor Street Widening on which it purports to be based. At p. 236 of the report of that case the same learned Justice of Appeal said:\nAn appeal can be had only upon a question of jurisdiction, or on any question of law (sec. 48(1) of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board Act), and in granting leave it was intended to reserve to the Court hearing the appeal power to determine whether the question raised by the appeal came within these words, and it is now argued that the appeal does not raise either a question of jurisdiction or of law.\nMiddleton J.A. proceeded to consider at length whether the question on which leave to appeal had been granted was one of jurisdiction or law and decided, with the concurrence of the majority, that it was \u201cboth a question of jurisdiction and of law\u201d.\nThe circumstance that the Court of Appeal in granting leave to appeal pursuant to s. 98(1) of The Ontario Municipal Board Act has described certain questions as being questions of jurisdiction or of law does not deprive the Court which hears the appeal of power to decide whether the questions submitted are in truth such questions.\nIn approaching the individual questions on which leave to appeal was granted, it is necessary to bear in mind two well-settled principles. First, that the duty of the tribunal empowered to determine the amount of compensation is to arrive at the sum of money which the owner, as a prudent man, at the moment of expropriation would have paid for the land taken rather than be deprived of it. On this point it is sufficient to refer to Woods Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. The King[5]. Second, that in arriving at that sum it is the duty of the tribunal to take into consideration the probability or even the possibility of the rescission of any by-law restricting the use to which the property may be put. On this point reference may be made to two judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario; Re Gibson and City of Toronto[6], particularly at p. 23, and Re Forbes and City of Toronto, particularly at p. 39.\nThe most important factor in deciding the amount of compensation in the present case was the probability or improbability of the respondent being able to have its lands rezoned to permit the uses referred to earlier in these reasons. Whether such a probability existed at the date of the expropriation and, if it did exist, its degree were both questions of fact on which the decision of the Board is final unless in arriving at its decision it has erred in some matter of law. The inquiry as to whether it has so erred is not at large but is limited to a consideration of the questions on which leave to appeal was granted.\nQuestion 1 is as follows:\nDid the Ontario Municipal Board err in considering the effect of by-law 10370 of the Township of Etobicoke?\nIf the point of law intended to be raised by this question is whether evidence of the fact of the by-law having been passed and of its contents was inadmissible, it is my opinion that it was admissible as showing that on the date of its passing the Council had reached the conclusion that the lands described in it were subject to the risk of being flooded and that no structures for residential or commercial purposes should be erected thereon. This evidence was relevant to the question whether the Council was likely in the future to rezone the lands described in the by-law to permit their use for commercial purposes. The circumstance that the Board had approved the by-law for a limited period only and that the period had expired on June 15, 1957, prior to the date of expropriation might affect the weight of this item of evidence but did not, in my opinion, render it inadmissible. The Board gave consideration to the fact that the Council had not applied for an extension of the Board\u2019s approval. The Court of Appeal were of the view that the failure of Council to apply for an extension of the approval established conclusively that by June 15, 1957, the township \u201chad as fully abandoned its former intention to control the land affected as if it had rescinded the by-law in question\u201d. With respect, this seems to me to be an inference of fact rather than a conclusion of law. If it were regarded as a statement of law it would appear to be at variance with the opinion expressed in the reasons of the Court of Appeal, delivered by Schroeder J.A., in Re Wright and Burlington[7].\nIf this were the only point raised by this question, I would answer it in the negative.\nHowever, Mr. Weir presented argument on another point which appears to me to be raised by the wording of Question 1; his submission is that the Board erred in law in directing itself that the fact of by-law 10370 having been passed had the effect of making the expropriated lands an entity entirely separate from the remainder of the respondent\u2019s 10.8 acre parcel so that in fixing the compensation for the lands taken it must not consider any added value to the respondent which those lands had by reason of their forming part of the larger parcel. The Board did not so direct itself in so many words but I am satisfied that it did so in effect.\nThe reasons of the Board read in part as follows:\nThe respondent accepts the value of $739 per acre for the lower lands and called no evidence of value in this regard. He takes the position that the flood zone by-law of the township passed November 5, 1956, had the effect of making the subject lands a separate entity and they cannot thus be considered as adjunct or part of the appellant\u2019s remaining lands at the top on the date of expropriation, in spite of the fact that the Corporation did not apply for a further time extension. This course was followed he contends, because the Conservation Authority had not decided what lands they wanted covered, and were negotiating with certain parties for acquisition of land. Meanwhile expropriations by the Authority were taking place up and down the river. Since the expropriation of the subject lands, however, a new flood zone by-law was passed on the 4th day of May, 1959.\nThe witness Davis, who gave the value of $739 per acre, made it clear that in his opinion the lands taken were worth very many times that amount to the respondent and that the answer in which he gave the figure of $739 was based on the premise, which counsel\u2019s question required him to accept, that the respondent could never acquire or use them. It is sufficient to quote the following passage from the evidence of Mr. Davis:\nMr. HONSBERGER: Q. I think I will phrase my question this way to see if it will simplify it. The value of that land if it is separated entirely from the top land and cannot be used in conjunction with the top land\u2014is that simpler?\nMr. WEIR: That includes the Old Mill as a purchaser?\nMr. HONSBERGER: I said it can\u2019t be used in conjunction with the top land.\nMr. WEIR: I think that is reasonable.\nThe CHAIRMAN: I think so.\nMr. HONSBERGER: Q. Will you give me that answer? A. If I may qualify my reply, that was the confusion in my mind earlier. To me it was a very hypothetical question. It wouldn\u2019t matter much who owned the bottom land as long as the Old Mill had use of them or would be able to buy them. If you exclude that, ask me to exclude that possibility of the Old Mill being able to acquire or use them in any way, shape or form, and they must remain a single entity for time immemorial (sic)\u2026\nQ. What I said, they can\u2019t at any time be attached to the upper lands. A. Yes, then I think the value would be in this neighbourhood of $739.00.\nThe fact that the Board fixed the value of the lands taken at $739 per acre shows that it did give to itself the direction of which Mr. Weir complains.\nIn my opinion, it erred in law in so doing. The giving of this direction would inevitably have the effect of rendering it unnecessary for the Board to give the consideration it would otherwise have given to the question of what estimate a prudent man in the position of the respondent would have made, on the date of expropriation, of the probability or possibility of the \u201ctable\u2011lands\u201d being rezoned to permit the erection of apartment houses. If the value of the lands taken was to be determined on the assumption that the respondent could never use or acquire them it would be a matter of indifference whether there was any possibility of the \u201ctable-lands\u201d, as distinguished from the lands taken, being rezoned. If, on the other hand, it was kept in mind that the mere fact of ownership of the lands taken would, in the event of the \u201ctable-lands\u201d being rezoned, permit the erection of an additional seventy-six suites, the duty, already alluded to, of taking into consideration and estimating the probability or possibility of amendment of the zoning by-law in regard to the \u201ctable-lands\u201d would assume great importance. I would answer Question 1 as follows:\u2014\u201dThe Board erred in law in directing itself that the effect of this by-law was to require the compensation for the lands expropriated to be fixed on the assumption that they were an entity separate from the remainder of the lands of the owner and that the owner could never acquire or use them.\u201d\nQuestion 2 is as follows:\nDid the Ontario Municipal Board err in considering the effect of a by-law passed by the Township of Etobicoke on the 4th day of May, 1959?\nThe by-law referred to in this question is number 11757; its enacting clauses are the same as those of number 10370.\nTo show how the Board dealt with this by-law in its reasons it is necessary to quote the following passage:\nThe evidence as to the flood land character of the subject land is very clearly established. Just as clear was the municipality\u2019s intent as to the future use of this property when it passed the original flood land by-law on November 5, 1956. The fact that application was not made to the Board for a time extension of its provisions does not in itself denote any change in the thinking of the Conservation Authority or the Corporation as to the ultimate use of this land.\nThe top land of the appellant has been zoned green belt for many years, as has the subject lands. No assurances were, or could be given by the Planning Board that the subject lands overlooking the Humber would be rezoned for a hotel use. The necessary rezoning may well have been considered as a primary and vital step even if the work was delayed for the reasons given, but in spite of this the evidence does not indicate any further overtures being made to the Planning Board by the appellant in a period extending over two years. The Board, as it must, has considered carefully the reasonable probability of the lands taken being rezoned. At the time of the first meeting with the Planning Board the appellant\u2019s lands were zoned green belt, and it would appear that when it was told to make a formal application for rezoning, this was the only hurdle to be surmounted. Under this prevailing circumstance then, formidable in itself, the appellant was told to make its application. On the 5th day of November, 1956, or 10 months later, By-law 10370 was passed designating the land for which rezoning was sought as flood lands Ex. No. 7 is the Board\u2019s order setting forth the temporary approval and its date of expiry June 15, 1957. In the light of these changed conditions, and in spite of the expiration of the temporary approval, it is not unreasonable to assume that the Planning Board in the normal course of its operations would have consulted the Conservation Authority and the council, before recommending any change in zoning, especially since the land had recently been covered by a flood land by-law. Evidence has indicated that the Conservation Authority was expropriating land up and down the river, and even if rezoning of the subject lands had passed the Planning Board level, it would still have to come under the careful scrutiny of council who in the last analysis are the final arbiters.\nIn all the circumstances and in the light of the evidence, the Board is of the opinion that there was not a reasonable probability of the desired zoning being realized, and this has been borne out by the fact that a new flood land by-law was put on these lands on the 4th day of May, 1959. By-law 11757 does not appear to have been entered as an exhibit on the hearing before the Board. In the agreement as to the contents of the case on appeal signed by the solicitors for the parties there is the following item:\nBy-laws of the Township of Etobicoke, Nos. 10370 and 11757, which were referred to before the Ontario Municipal Board.\nThe argument of counsel before the Board was not transcribed and we do not know how the by-law was introduced or whether objection was taken to the Board giving consideration to its existence, but this does not seem to me to be of importance. Its relevance, if any, was to the questions whether (i) the lands described in it and in by-law 10370 were, at the date of the expropriation, lands liable to flooding and, (ii) whether they were at that date so regarded by the responsible officers of the township; quite apart from by-law 11757 there was ample evidence to support the view of the Board that both these questions should be answered in the affirmative. As I read the reasons of the Board they do not rest their decision on these points on the passing of by-law 11757, which would be wisdom after the event, but rather refer to it as showing that their conclusion reached on a consideration of the circumstances existing at the date of the expropriation has received subsequent confirmation.\nI would answer Question 2 in the negative.\nQuestion 3 is as follows:\nDid the Ontario Municipal Board err in considering and making findings with respect to the state of mind of the Municipal Corporation and the Conservation Authority?\nIn the passage from the reasons of the Board quoted above they use the expressions, \u201cthe municipality\u2019s intent as to the future use of this property\u201d, and \u201cthe thinking of the Conservation Authority or the Corporation as to the ultimate use of this land\u201d.In a frequently quoted passage, applicable to all corporate bodies, Lord Sumner said, in Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Fisher\u2019s Executors[8]:\nIn any case desires and intentions are things of which a company is incapable. These are the mental operations of its shareholders and officers. The only intention that the company has is such as is expressed in or necessarily follows from its proceedings. It is hardly a paradox to say that the form of a company\u2019s resolutions and instruments is their substance. On the same page Lord Sumner refers to cases in which Atkin L.J., as he then was, used the expression \u201cthe intention of the company\u201d and Viscount Cave spoke of \u201cthe last thing which the company desired\u201d.\nWhen the reasons of the Board are read as a whole it seems clear that these forms of expression were used to state the view of the Board, arrived at on a consideration of the relevant evidence, that in any future action relating to these lands the Council of the Township and the Conservation Authority would proceed on the basis that the lands described in by-law 10370 were liable to be flooded. The Board was engaged at this point in forecasting the probable future actions of the corporate bodies referred to. They did not, in my opinion, err in law. If they erred in their choice of words they appear to have done so in good company.\nI would answer Question 3 in the negative.\nQuestions 4 and 5 were dealt with together by the Court of Appeal. They are as follows:\n4. Was there any evidence upon which the Ontario Municipal Board could presume that the Planning Board of the Township of Etobicoke would consult the Conservation Authority prior to dealing with any applications before it for re-zoning?\n5. If there was any such evidence, did the Ontario Municipal Board err in law in giving effect to that presumption?\nI do not find it necessary to deal with Mr. Kellock\u2019s submission that it was the statutory duty of the Planning Board to consult with the Conservation Authority; in my opinion, the circumstances disclosed in the evidence indicated that it would be proper for it to do so and it was reasonable for the Board to make the assumption which it made. With respect, I find myself unable to agree with the view of the Court of Appeal that the reasons of the Board show that it assumed that the Planning Board would fail to retain its autonomy and independence.\nI would answer Question 4 in the affirmative and Question 5 in the negative.\nThe Court of Appeal answered Question 6 in the negative and, before us, neither party sought to vary this answer.\nQuestion 7 is as follows:\nWas there any evidence to support the finding of the Ontario Municipal Board that in the opinion of the Planning Director of the Township of Etobicoke the highest and best use of the appellant\u2019s top lands would be a public use? In dealing with this question the Court of Appeal quoted the following passage from the reasons of the Board.\nThe Planning Director of the Township of Etobicoke in his evidence said the top lands from the owner\u2019s point of view would be suitable for apartments, but gave it his opinion under cross-examination, that the highest and best use of the top lands of the appellant would be for a public use and the land should be precluded from all building.\nRead in its context this appears to me simply to form part of the Board\u2019s summary of some of the evidence given before it. I find nothing in it to suggest that the Board thought the witness was saying that the best use of the lands from the owner\u2019s point of view would be that they should be dedicated to the public. That would have been a self-evident absurdity. The effect of the evidence of this witness appears to be that, in his opinion, although from the owner\u2019s point of view the erection of apartment houses on its land would be desirable, from the point of view of the general public it would be best that all building be prohibited. I do not find anything in the reasons of the Board to indicate that it misunderstood or misdirected itself as to the effect of what this witness said. I find it difficult to say that Question 7 is one of law but, on the assumption that it is, I would answer it in the affirmative.\nFor these reasons I would allow the appeal to the extent indicated and direct that the paragraphs of the order of the Court of Appeal reading as follows:\nTHIS COURT DID ORDER that Questions Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5 be answered in the affirmative and Questions Nos. 4, 6 and 7 be answered in the negative.\nAND THIS COURT DID FURTHER ORDER that the compensation allowed the Appellant pursuant to the Order of the Ontario Municipal Board dated August 20th, 1960, be increased to the sum of $77,313.00.\nbe deleted and that the following be substituted therefor:\n\u201cTHIS COURT DID ORDER that Question 1 be answered as follows: The Board erred in law in directing itself that the effect of this by-law was to require the compensation for the lands expropriated to be fixed on the assumption that they were an entity separate from the remainder of the lands of the owner and that the owner could never acquire or use them.\u2019, that Questions 2, 3, 5 and 6 be answered in the negative and that Questions 4 and 7 be answered in the affirmative. AND THIS COURT DID FURTHER ORDER that the matter be returned to the Board to be dealt with in accordance with the answers above set out.\u201d\nIt was necessary for the respondent to appeal to the Court of Appeal and, in turn, it was necessary for the appellant to appeal to this Court. The order of the Court of Appeal as to costs should stand but the appellant is entitled to its costs in this Court and I would so order.\nJUDSON J. (dissenting in part):\u2014I agree with the judgment of Cartwright J. except on question 1. As stated in his reasons, the Board found \u201cthat there was no reasonable probability of the desired zoning being realized.\u201d If the reasons of the Board are taken as a whole, I do not think that the mention of severance means anything more than the lack of this reasonable probability of rezoning the whole area including the expropriated land. This is not error in law. The respondent\u2019s artificial structure of hypothesis collapses when it is realized that it depends upon getting such a decision. These expropriated lands could only have value to the owner of the amount assigned to them by the respondent if they remained part of the whole and were rezoned.\nThe respondent seeks to build up value in this way. First, there are plans for a motel to be operated in conjunction with its established restaurant. This would involve putting supporting pillars on the lands in question. When expropriation makes this impossible, the motel must be placed on the table-lands, which otherwise would be used for an apartment building. Then the loss of the bottom lands destroys much of the value of the table-lands for an apartment site because the area of the bottom lands could be used as part of the computation of the land required for such a purpose and thus make possible the building of more suites.\nThe foundation for all this disappears with the finding of fact made by the Board. I would answer question 1 in the negative.\nAppeal allowed, JUDSON J. dissenting in part.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Roebuck & Walkinshaw, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Mason, Foulds, Arnup, Walter, Weir & Boeckh, Toronto.\n[1] [1961] O.R. 783, 29 D.L.R.

An application for an order that the money exhibits be returned to the respondent or alternatively that a sum of money equivalent in value to the said money exhibits be paid to the respondent in lieu of the return of the money exhibits was dismissed. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the appeal should be allowed and an order made that the money exhibits be returned to the respondent. By leave of this Court the Crown appealed from that judgment.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nThe alternative claim advanced was a claim to recover monies from the Crown. The Court of Appeal dealt with the matter on the footing that the monies were then in the custody of the registrar, whereas there were no such monies. Since this was made known to the Court in a report made by the County Court judge and was common ground between the parties, the proper construction to be placed upon the judgment was that it constituted an award against the Crown in favour of the respondent in the amount stated. The respondent's remedy, if any, was by proceedings initiated by petition of right under the provisions of the Crown Procedure Act. The question of the Crown's liability must first have been determined by the Supreme Court of the province before the Court of Appeal acquired jurisdiction to deal with the matter. The order dismissing the application should therefore be restored upon the ground that the County Court was without jurisdiction to deal with the money claim made against the Crown.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], setting aside an order of Remnant C.C.J. Appeal allowed. W. G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the appellant.\nH. Rankin, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nLOCKE J.:\u2014This is an appeal brought by leave granted by this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] setting aside an order made by His Honour Judge Remnant in the County Court of Vancouver and directing that a sum of $3,275 in American funds, or the equivalent thereof in Canadian funds, be paid to the respondent.\nThe respondent Doig was on April 25, 1957, found guilty in the County Court Judge's Criminal Court of Vancouver of four charges of counterfeiting and conspiracy to counterfeit and sentenced to four years' imprisonment. At the time of his arrest he had in his possession two envelopes, one of which was said to contain $2,200 in American currency and the second $1,075 of such currency, and the envelopes said to contain these monies were filed as exhibits at his trial. After his conviction they remained in the custody of the registrar of the Court.\nFollowing the release of Doig from the penitentiary, his solicitor served a notice on counsel for the Crown which was entitled \"In the County Court Judge's Criminal Court In the Matter of Regina vs. William Thomas Alexander Doig\" and which stated that an application would be made before the judge in chambers on September 19, 1960, for an order\nthat the money exhibits in the criminal case of Regina vs. Doig, number 31\/57 be returned to the Defendant.\nThis application was supported by an affidavit of Mr. Lawrence E. Hill, the solicitor for Doig, which stated, inter alia, that he had been advised by the registrar that:\nthe original money exhibit is no longer within the custody of the said Registrar, the said original exhibit having disappeared from the said Registry and that whatever disposition is made of the monies hereinbefore referred to it will be necessary that the Province of British Columbia replace the said monies with an equivalent amount.\nThereafter, a notice dated October 3, 1960, was served by the solicitor for Doig informing the Crown that:\nthe application will be for an Order directing that the money exhibits in the criminal case of Regina vs. Doig be returned to the Defendant or alternatively that a sum of money equivalent in value to the said money exhibits be paid to the Defendant in lieu of the return of the said money exhibits. While the amended notice did not say in terms that what was proposed was an order against the Crown to pay the missing monies, it is common ground that this was the relief sought.\nThe learned County Court judge dismissed the application and while no written reasons were given at the time, when the appeal was taken by Doig from the order the learned judge made a report to the Court of Appeal, stated to be made pursuant to s. 588(1) of the Criminal Code, in which it was said that all the monies were proved to be the proceeds of the criminal activities of Doig and that they should remain in custody of the Court. The report concluded by stating that the fact that the money had disappeared from the registry was beside the point.\nThe formal order dismissing the application was entitled \"In the County Court Judge's Criminal Court\" and the style of cause was \"Regina vs. William Thomas Alexander Doig.\"\nThe judgment delivered by the learned Chief Justice of British Columbia did not mention the fact that the monies were missing. After saying that it had been agreed by counsel on the hearing of the appeal that it had not been established that the money had been obtained by the commission of the offence for which the appellant had been convicted, he said:\nIt is clear as a result of the foregoing that the question here and the order appealed from affect a right to property in the custody of the County Court in respect of which there is no applicable provisions of the Criminal Code. The order sought by the appellant is not one to be made or refused under the criminal jurisdiction of the County Court. This Court, in my opinion, has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal and the motion of the Crown to quash should be denied.\nAfter referring to authorities indicating that monies taken from an accused person, unless they are shown to have been obtained by the commission of an offence, should be returned to him, the learned Chief Justice said:\nThis Court has jurisdiction to make the order that should have been made in the Court below, the appeal should be allowed and an order made that the money be paid out to the appellant.\nThe style of cause in the formal judgment entered in the Court of Appeal was \"Regina, Respondent, William Thomas Alexander Doig, Appellant.\" After stating that the appeal was allowed, the judgment reads:\nand the said money exhibits amounting to Three Thousand Two Hundred and Seventy-five dollars in American funds or the equivalent thereof in Canadian funds are hereby ordered returned to the appellant. It will be seen from the foregoing that the matter has been treated in both Courts as if the monies in question were in the hands of the proper official of the Court, the registrar, presumably as a servant of the Crown. While, as I have pointed out, it was known to the parties before the matter came before the learned County Court judge that the monies were missing, the solicitor for the present respondent, while appreciating that he could not obtain the form of relief sought in the original notice of motion, failed to appreciate that the alternative claim advanced was a claim to recover monies from the Crown.\nIf there was any basis for such a claim, presumably it would be for damages for conversion or for negligence of some servant of the Crown. In whatever form the claim might have been advanced, the matter would be governed by the provisions of the Crown Procedure Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 89, and the Court having jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, if a fiat were obtained from the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, and the proceedings would be by petition of right.\nThis aspect of the matter does not appear to have been drawn to the attention of the learned County Court judge who treated the application as if it were made in the criminal proceedings against the respondent which had been terminated years before. The appeal to the Court of Appeal which was brought by leave was not one under Part 18 of the Criminal Code and s. 588(1), requiring a report by the judge in appeals and applications for leave to appeal taken under that part, was inapplicable.\nIn the judgment of the Court of Appeal it was pointed out that the order sought was not one to be made or refused in the exercise of the criminal jurisdiction of the County Court. However, that judgment, with great respect, dealt with the matter on the footing that the monies were then in the custody of the registrar, whereas there were no such monies.\nSince this was made known to the Court in the report made by the County Court judge and was common ground between the parties, the proper construction to be placed upon the judgment is, in my opinion, that it constitutes an award against the Crown in favour of the respondent in the amount stated. Claims of this nature against the Crown may not be established in proceedings initiated by notice of motion in the County Court. As I have pointed out, the respondent's remedy, if any, was by proceedings initiated by petition of right under the provisions of the Crown Procedure Act. The question of the Crown's liability must first have been determined by the Supreme Court of the province before the Court of Appeal acquired jurisdiction to deal with the matter.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the order dismissing the application be restored upon the ground that the County Court was without jurisdiction to deal with the money claim made against the Crown. The dismissal should be without prejudice to any claims the respondent may be advised to make in the matter in proceedings properly constituted.\nAppeal allowed and the order dismissing the application restored.\nSolicitor for the appellant: George L. Murray, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Lawrence E. Hill, Vancouver.\n[1] (1961), 130 C.C.C. 95.\n[2] (1961), 130 C.C.C. 95.\n",

The donee survived the donor and died without issue after having disposed by will of the said properties in favour of his nephews and nieces.\nThe sisters instituted this action to claim the property and argued that the word \"disposed\" meant during the donee's lifetime. The nephews and nieces argued that the will constituted a disposition by the donee and that at his death there was no undisposed property. The trial judgemaintained the action, but this judgment was reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench in a majority judgment. The sisters appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe general word \"to dispose\" includes testamentary dispositions as well as inter vivos dispositions. In the context of this clause as in the context of the deed of donation as a whole, that word could not, in this case, be given a meaning excluding a testamentary disposition. Consequently, the nephews and nieces were entitled to the property given to them by the donee's will.

Appeal dismissed.\nJean Duchesne, for the plaintiffs, appellants.\nGodefroy Laurendeau, Q.C., for the defendants, respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nFauteux J.:\u2014Par acte authentique, fait et sign\u00e9 \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al le 17 juin 1914, Benjamin D\u00e9carie fit donation entre vifs de certains immeubles \u00e0 son fils Etienne acceptant, le donateur se r\u00e9servant l'usufruit de ces biens sa vie durant.

D'une part, les appelants, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la substitution conditionnelle de residuo y stipul\u00e9e, soumettent que \u00absans avoir dispos\u00e9\u00bb signifie sans avoir dispos\u00e9 de son vivant ; ainsi interpr\u00e9t\u00e9, cette deuxi\u00e8me condition ne s'\u00e9tant pas r\u00e9alis\u00e9e, vu que les immeubles \u00e9taient encore en possession d'Etienne D\u00e9carie au moment de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, ils auraient droit d'\u00eatre reconnus propri\u00e9taires indivis de ces immeubles, chacun pour la part mentionn\u00e9e en la demande principale et en la demande incidente. D'autre part, les intim\u00e9s, l\u00e9gataires d'Etienne D\u00e9carie, pr\u00e9tendent que l'expression \u00absans avoir dispos\u00e9\u00bb n'est pas qualifi\u00e9e et comprend la disposition testamentaire aussi bien que la disposition entre vifs; il s'ensuivrait, vu qu'Etienne D\u00e9carie testa de ces biens en faveur des intim\u00e9s, que les appelants n'y auraient aucun droit et les demandes principale et incidente en cette cause devraient \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es. Telle est en somme la question dominante en cette cause.\nLa Cour d'Appel2, par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire, fit droit aux intim\u00e9s. Dans ses raisons de jugement, auxquelles ses coll\u00e8gues, MM. les Juges Bissonnette et Hyde ont donn\u00e9 leur accord, M. le Juge Tremblay, Juge en chef de la Cour d'Appel, fait un expos\u00e9 complet des faits et du droit sur les questions pertinentes \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination du litige.

The defendant had been drinking, but there was no evidence to indicate the plaintiff knew how much he had consumed prior to his arrival at the restaurant; before leaving the restaurant the plaintiff and her companion had a drink with the defendant. At the night club the defendant was served with approximately 10 ounces of liquor in less than two hours, and during that time his guests accepted one drink each. There was some discussion between the plaintiff and her friend before leaving the club as to ordering a taxi, but the defendant said he would drive them home and they went with him. While driving his car the defendant had an accident, as a result of which the plaintiff suffered serious personal injuries. In an action for damages, the trial judge found that the accident was caused by the gross negligence of the defendant and this finding was not questioned in the Court of Appeal or before this Court. The action was dismissed on the ground that the plaintiff was volens. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, allowed the appeal holding that the plaintiff was not volens but was guilty of contributory negligence to the extent of 25 per cent. The defendant appealed to this Court.\nHeld (Kerwin C J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nPer Cartwright, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The defence of volenti non fit injuria did not apply in this case. The plaintiff, although apprehensive that the defendant would drive negligently and that an accident might result, decided to take a chance and go with him; she thereby incurred physical as distinct from legal risk. There was nothing to warrant a finding that she decided to waive her right of action should she be injured or that she communicated any such decision to the defendant. Car and General Insurance Corporation Ltd. v. Seymour and Maloney, [1956] S.C.R. 322, applied; Miller v. Decker, [1957] S.C.R. 624, distinguished; Slater v. Clay Cross Co., Ltd., [1956] 2 All E.R. 625; Dann v. Hamilton, [1939] 1 K.B. 509, referred to.\nAs to the quantum of damages, this Court is slow to interfere with the amount fixed by a provincial Appellate Court which, as in the present case, has varied the assessment made by the trial judge. The amount fixed by the Court of Appeal was not excessive. Lang et al. v. Pollard et al., [1957] S.C.R. 858, referred to. Per Kerwin C.J., dissenting: The burden resting upon the defendant of proving that the plaintiff expressly, or by necessary implication, agreed to exempt the defendant from liability for any damages suffered by the plaintiff occasioned by the former's negligence was met.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba1, allowing an appeal from a judgment of Campbell J. Appeal dismissed, Kerwin C.J. dissenting.\nF. D. Allen, for the defendant, appellant.\nJ. F. O'Sullivan and S. I. Schwartz, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting):\u2014The question of the applicability of the maxim of volenti non fit injuria is settled by the decisions of this Court in Car and General Insurance Corporation Ltd. v. Seymour and Moloney2 and Miller v. Decker3. Difficulties arise in applying the maxim, as appears from the reasons for judgment in those two cases and in the present appeal. Upon a review of the evidence, I find myself in agreement with Mr. Justice Tritschler, who gives the testimony in detail applicable to the point. It might be noted that the Chief Justice of Manitoba was in error in deciding that the important stage at which the matter should be considered was when the plaintiff left the Ivanhoe and I understand that the other Members of this Court agree that the relevant time was when the plaintiff left the Rancho. For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Tritschler, I have concluded that the burden resting upon the defendant of proving that the plaintiff expressly, or by necessary implication, agreed to exempt the appellant from liability for any damages suffered by the plaintiff occasioned by that negligence has been met.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment at the trial, but there should be no costs of the motion before us to quash the appeal and of the motion for leave to appeal.\nThe judgment of Cartwright, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nCartwright J.:\u2014This appeal raises questions of importance as to the applicability of the maxim volenti non fit injuria on which there has been divergence of opinion among the learned judges in the Courts below. The action was brought by the respondent for damages for serious personal injuries suffered by her while being transported by the appellant in his motor vehicle as his guest without payment for the transportation. The accident happened at about 11.05 p.m. on May 7, 1959; the learned trial judge found that it was caused by the gross negligence of the appellant. This finding which, under the terms of s. 99(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 112, was essential to the respondent's cause of action was not questioned in the Court of Appeal or before us.\nThe learned trial judge dismissed the action on the ground that the respondent was volens. He went on to say that had he held she was not volens he would have found her guilty of contributory negligence and apportioned seventy-five per cent of the responsibility to her. He made a provisional assessment of her special damages at $7,850.58 and of her general damages at $12,000.\nThe Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, allowed the appeal holding that the respondent was not volens but was guilty of contributory negligence to the extent of twenty-five per cent and that her general damages should be assessed at $18,000. Judgment was accordingly entered in her favour for $19,387.93 and costs. Tritschler and Guy JJ.A., dissenting, would have dismissed the appeal.\nThe appellant asks that the judgment at the trial be restored; alternatively he asks that the findings of the learned trial judge as to the degree of contributory negligence and the quantum of damages be restored.\nThe respondent supports the judgment of the Court of Appeal and does not attack the finding that she was guilty of contributory negligence to the extent of twenty-five per cent.\nThe learned trial judge did not regard either the respondent or her companion, Mrs. Hartogsveld, as a convincing witness. The majority in the Court of Appeal did not vary any finding of fact as to the events preceding the moment of the accident on which there was a conflict of testimony, but took the view that the learned trial judge was mistaken in the inferences which he drew from the primary facts.\nThe defendant filed a statement of defence and was examined for discovery but at the time of the trial his whereabouts were unknown and his defence was conducted by counsel instructed, pursuant to s. 154 of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 112, by the Provincial Treasurer who also instructed counsel on the appeals to the Court of Appeal and to this Court.\nOn the day of the accident the defendant was drinking at the noon hour and at dinner-time in the evening; after dinner he proceeded to the Ivanhoe Restaurant in downtown Winnipeg, where he had another drink. At that restaurant he met the plaintiff and her friend, Mrs. Hartogsveld, who were having dinner; he invited them to accompany him to the Rancho Don Carlos, hereinafter referred to as \"the Rancho\", a night club in the suburbs of the City of Winnipeg, where meals and alcoholic beverages were served and there was a floor show. The plaintiff and Mrs. Hartogsveld had a drink with the defendant before leaving the Ivanhoe and, having accepted his invitation, they left with him for the Rancho and arrived there about 9:00 p.m.\nThere is no evidence to indicate that the plaintiff knew how much drinking the defendant had done prior to his arrival at the Ivanhoe. It appears that the defendant, who is an architect, was a well-known habitu\u00e9 of the Rancho; the waitresses knew him and knew that he could \"handle\" a substantial amount of liquor; they served him four \"doubles\", totalling about 10 ounces of rye whiskey, in less than two hours. The plaintiff knew that the defendant was drinking. The plaintiff and Mrs. Hartogsveld accepted one drink each but refused any more. The waitresses realized that the defendant was getting noisy and thought he had had too much to drink but did not refuse to serve him liquor when he ordered it. The plaintiff did not know the defendant well but had been out with him before. The evidence is silent as to whether he consumed liquor on those occasions, but the plaintiff said on her examination for discovery, which the learned trial judge accepted in preference to her evidence at the trial, that the defendant always drove too fast, paid no attention to any protest, that driving with him made her sick, that she was always afraid of an accident when driving with him and that she was afraid on the drive from the Ivanhoe to the Rancho.\nThere was some discussion between the plaintiff and Mrs. Hartogsveld before leaving the Rancho as to ordering a taxi in which to go home but the defendant said he would drive them home and they went with him. The learned trial judge rejected the explanations of the plaintiff and Mrs. Hartogsveld that they did this because the defendant had their coat checks and they felt under a social obligation to go with him because of the entertainment he had provided for them. The learned trial judge said at this point:\nThese excuses are of the weakest nature. Both of these women were sufficiently mature to stand up for themselves but obviously decided to take their chances.\nThe critical point of time is when the plaintiff got into the defendant's car to be driven home from the Rancho. The finding of the learned trial judge that the condition of the defendant at this point \"was produced by a quantity of alcohol sufficient to cause him to lose control of his faculties to such an extent that he was unable to safely drive his car\" was supported by the evidence and was not challenged before us.\nWhile it is obvious that the plaintiff knew that the defendant had been drinking, the evidence does not establish that she was aware that he was intoxicated to the extent found by the learned trial judge. The plaintiff deposed that the defendant was not drunk and that he did not appear to have been affected by the liquor he had taken. The witness John Campbell who was with the plaintiff and the defendant during part of the time they were at the Rancho (but not when they left) said that he thought the defendant \"was normal\". It is of some significance that no one at the Rancho appears to have made any suggestion that the defendant ought not to drive. There is no evidence that the defendant had ever previously been involved in an accident.\nAfter reading all the evidence with care, in the light of the observations made by the learned trial judge as to the reliability of the witnesses, it appears to me that the facts on which, in this case, the applicability of the maxim volenti non fit injuria depends may be summarized as follows.\nWhen the plaintiff entered the defendant's car at the Rancho to be driven home she was under no compulsion, legal or practical, to do so. At that moment the defendant was in fact under the influence of liquor to such an extent as to increase the chances of a collision resulting from his negligence and, while I am doubtful whether the evidence establishes it, I assume for the purposes of this appeal that the plaintiff was aware of this. The plaintiff was afraid to go with the defendant, primarily because on the previous occasions when she had done so he drove too fast and paid no attention to any remonstrance, but also (I will assume) because she knew he had been drinking. In spite of this she went with him because he urged her to do so and she lacked the resolution to refuse.\nOn these facts I agree with the conclusion of the majority in the Court of Appeal that the maxim has no application.\nThe decision of this Court in Car and General Insurance Corporation Ltd. v. Seymour and Moloney4 renders it unnecessary to make any lengthy examination of the authorities, which were fully considered in the judgments delivered in that case, particularly in that of Doull J., in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (in Banco)5. That decision establishes that where a driver of a motor vehicle invokes the maxim volenti non fit injuria as a defence to an action for damages for injuries caused by his negligence to a passenger, the burden lies upon the defendant of proving that the plaintiff, expressly or by necessary implication, agreed to exempt the defendant from liability for any damage suffered by the plaintiff occasioned by that negligence, and that, as stated in Salmond on Torts, 13th ed., p. 44:\nThe true question in every case is: Did the plaintiff give a real consent to the assumption of the risk without compensation; did the consent really absolve the defendant from the duty to take care?\nThere is nothing in the reasons delivered in this Court in Miller v. Decker6 to throw any doubt on the principles enunciated in Seymour's case. In Miller v. Decker the majority were of the view that an agreement of the nature defined in Seymour's case should be implied from the active encouragement by the plaintiff of the defendant's conduct which resulted in disaster while the minority took the contrary view. The difference of opinion was not as to the applicable law but as to what inference of fact should be drawn from the primary facts. I share the view expressed by the Court of Appeal in England in Slater v. Clay Cross Co., Ltd.7, that the judgment of Asquith J., as he then was, in Dann v. Hamilton8 in so far as he decided that the doctrine of volenti did not apply was correct.\nThere is a most useful discussion as to when the defence of volenti non fit injuria is admitted in Mr. Glanville Williams' work Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence (1951). At p. 296 the learned author points out that \"the scope of the defence has been progressively curtailed since the end of the last century, so that at the present day it is allowed only when there is a positive agreement waiving the right of action\".\nI wish to adopt the following passages at p. 308 of the last mentioned work:\nIt is submitted that the key to an understanding of the true scope of the volens maxim lies in drawing a distinction between what may be called physical and legal risk. Physical risk is the risk of damage in fact; legal risk is the risk of damage in fact for which there will be no redress in law.\n* * *\nTo put this in general terms, the defence of volens does not apply where as a result of a mental process the plaintiff decides to take a chance but there is nothing in his conduct to show a waiver of the right of action communicated to the other party. To constitute a defence, there must have been an express or implied bargain between the parties whereby the plaintiff gave up his right of action for negligence.\nOn the facts of the case at bar the plaintiff, although apprehensive that the defendant would drive negligently and that an accident might result, decided to take a chance and go with him, that is to say, employing the phraseology of the passages just quoted, she thereby incurred the physical risk. In my opinion, there is nothing to warrant a finding that she decided to waive her right of action should she be injured or that she communicated any such decision to the defendant.\nIt has already been mentioned that counsel for the respondent did not attack the findings made by the majority in the Court of Appeal that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence because her decision to go with the defendant was a failure to take reasonable care for her own safety and that twenty-five per cent of the responsibility for the accident should be attributed to her. I am unable to agree with the argument of counsel for the appellant that this percentage should be increased.\nAs to the quantum of damages, this Court is slow to interfere with the amount fixed by a provincial Appellate Court which has varied the assessment made by a trial judge. It is sufficient on this point to refer to the case of Lang et al. v. Pollard et al.1 In the case at bar a perusal of the evidence brings me to the conclusion that the amount fixed by the Court of Appeal is not excessive.\nAt the opening of the appeal counsel for the respondent moved to quash the appeal and counsel for the appellant, ex abundanti cautela, moved for leave to appeal. Both of these motions were dismissed, the costs in each case being reserved. I would now direct that there be no order as to costs in either motion.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs, Kerwin C.J. dissenting.\nSolicitors for the defendant, appellant: Aikens, MacAulay, Moffat, Dickson, Hinch & McGivan, Winnipeg.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, respondent: Walsh, Micay, O'Sullivan, Bowman & Schwartz, Winnipeg.\n1 (1962), 37 W.W.R. 267, 31 D.L.R.

Appellant;\nand\nThe Minister of National Revenue Respondent.\n1962: November 20, 21; 1962: December 6.\nPresent: Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nTaxation\u2014Income tax\u2014Whether taxpayer qualified to claim certain deductions by reason of having paid income tax in Quebec\u2014Requirements to constitute a permanent establishment\u2014The Income Tax Act, 1948, s. 31, enacted by Statutes of Canada 1952, c. 29, s. 13\u2014Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, s. 40, amended by Statutes of Canada 1952-58, c. 40, s. 59(1).\u2014Income Tax Regulations 400, 401, 402, 411(1)(a)(b), (2).\nThe appellant company, whose head office and plant were in Ontario, manufactured various electrical appliances and equipment which it sold exclusively to wholesale distributors across Canada. As its sales representative in the Province of Quebec in the years 1952, 1953 and 1954, the company employed C from March 31, 1952, to February 10, 1953, and D from April 10, 1953, until a year and a half after the end of 1954. These representatives did not have authority to make contracts on the appellant's behalf and did not keep in Quebec a supply of goods for delivery as a result of sales which they made. Orders were filled from the appellant's plant in Ontario. C and D each maintained an office in his own residence at his own expense and each used his office for doing the paper work involved in the business and for sales demonstration purposes. The company's claim for tax deductions under certain provisions of the Income Tax Regulations on the ground that it had a permanent establishment in Quebec in 1952, 1953 and 1954 was disallowed by the Minister. The Income Tax Appeal Board ruled in favour of the company, but an appeal from this decision was allowed by the Exchequer Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nThe appellant did not have a \"permanent establishment\" in the Province of Quebec in the years in question. Interpreting those words, apart from the provisions of s. 411(l)(a) of the Regulations, the word \"establishment\" contemplates a fixed place of business of the corporation, a local habitation of its own. The word \"permanent\" means that the establishment is a stable one, and not of a temporary or tentative character.\nParagraph (a) of s. 411(1) of the Regulations defines various kinds of places of business which constitute a permanent establishment. The fact that the appellant's employee, for the discharge of his duties under his contract, set up an office in his own premises did not constitute that office a branch, an office or an agency of the appellant. Such office was not a permanent establishment of the appellant.\nUnder para. (b) of s. 411(1) of the Regulations an employee or agent can be deemed to operate a permanent establishment of a corporation, but only if he has authority to contract for his employer or principal, or if he has a stock of merchandise from which he regularly fills orders which he receives. Neither of these requirements was met in the present case.\nThe submission that the appellant had a permanent establishment in Quebec, by virtue of subs. (2) of s. 411 of the Regulations, because its sales representatives had \"substantial machinery or equipment\", varying in value from $4,000 to $11,000, on their premises, in the tax years in question, which they used for sales demonstrations, was rejected. As used in this subsection, the adjective \"substantial\" was intended to mean substantial in size. The use made by the sales representatives of the appellant's products for sales demonstration purposes did not constitute that kind of \"use\" which was contemplated by the subsection. In order to come within the subsection, the machinery or equipment would have to be used by the taxpayer for the purpose for which it was created. APPEAL from a judgment of Cameron J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, allowing an appeal from a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board. Appeal dismissed.\nJ. J. Robinette, Q.C., and J. A. Langford, for the appellant.\nD.S.Maxwell, Q.C., and T. Z. Boles, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nMartland J.:\u2014This appeal is from a judgment of Cameron J., in the Exchequer Court2, who allowed an appeal by the respondent from a decision of the Income Tax Appeal Board. The Board had allowed the appellant's appeal from reassessments for income tax for the years 1952, 1953 and 1954.\nIn issue is the right of the appellant to claim certain deductions from its income tax in each of those years by reason of its having paid income tax in those years in the Province of Quebec. The relevant statutory provisions are s. 37 of The Income Tax Act of 1948, as enacted in s. 13 of c. 29 of the Statutes of Canada, 1952, in respect of the year 1952, and s. 40 of c. 148 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1952, as amended by s. 59(1) of c. 40 of the Statutes of Canada, 1952-53, in respect of the years 1953 and 1954.\nThe sole issue is as to whether the appellant qualifies to claim the deductions under the provisions of the Income Tax Regulations and the question for decision is did the appellant, in the years in question, have a permanent establishment in the Province of Quebec?\nSections 400, 401 and 402 of the Income Tax Regulations, as applicable to the 1952 and subsequent taxation years, were made by PC 1953-255 of February 19,1953. Those sections were later amended by PC 1953-1773 of November 19, 1953, mainly in order to substitute references to s. 40 of c. 148, R.S.C. 1952, for the original references to s. 37 of the 1948 Income Tax Act. These sections, as amended, are in part as follows:\n400. (1) The Province of Quebec is the province prescribed for the purpose of section 40 of the Act. (2) For the purpose of paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of section 40 of the Act, the following classes of corporations are prescribed:\n(a) corporations that are taxable under the provisions of section 3 of the Quebec Corporation Tax Act and that are not taxable under the provisions of section 6 of the Quebec Corporation Tax Act, and\n* * *\n401. For the purpose of subsection (2) of section 40 of the Act, the amount of taxable income earned in a taxation year in a province shall be determined as hereinafter set forth in this Part.\n402. (1) Where, in a taxation year, a corporation had no permanent establishment outside the province, the whole of its taxable income for the year shall be deemed to have been earned in the province.\n(2) Where, in a taxation year, a corporation had no permanent establishment in the province, no part of its taxable income for the year shall be deemed to have been earned in the province.\nSubsections (3) and (4) are rules for determining the amount of the taxable income earned in the year in the province (Quebec) where a corporation had a permanent establishment in that province and a permanent establishment outside that province. It is unnecessary to refer to them in detail as the parties are agreed that the deductions claimed by the appellant in each of the years in question have been computed in accordance with such rules.\nSection 411 of the Regulations reads, in part, as follows:\n411. (1) For the purpose of this Part,\n(a) \"permanent establishment\" includes branches, mines, oil wells, farms, timber lands, factories, workshops, warehouses, offices, agencies, and other fixed places of business;\n(b) where a corporation carries on business through an employee or agent who has general authority to contract for his employer or principal or has a stock of merchandise from which he regularly fills orders which he receives, the said agent or employee shall be deemed to operate a permanent establishment of the corporation;\n(2) The use of substantial machinery or equipment in a particular place at any time in a taxation year shall constitute a permanent establishment in that place for the year.\nThe facts are not in dispute. The appellant is a company, incorporated under the laws of Canada, having its head office and manufacturing plant in the Province of Ontario. During the taxation years in question the appellant sold its wares in the Province of Quebec and other provinces of Canada.\nThe appellant manufactured electrical appliances, cattle clipping and shearing equipment and lawn and garden equipment. These products were sold by the appellant exclusively to wholesale distributors across Canada. It had four sales representatives, located respectively in Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto and Montreal. A large number of sales representatives were not required because of the appellant's policy of selling to wholesale distributors exclusively. In the Province of Quebec there were not more than approximately 25 such distributors, of whom 15 were in the Montreal area.\nApproximately 14 per cent or 15 per cent of the appellant's sales by value were made to the 25 distributors in the Province of Quebec. The Quebec sales representative was also responsible for sales to distributors in the Atlantic Provinces, which together, during the taxation years in question, accounted for a further 5 per cent approximately, of the appellant's sales.\nIn the years 1952, 1953 and 1954, the appellant had a sales representative in the Province of Quebec, a Mr. Comtois, from March 31, 1952, to February 10, 1953, and a Mr. Dyke, from April 10, 1953, until a year and a half after the end of the year 1954.\nThese sales representatives were employed pursuant to written agreements with the appellant. That with Comtois was for the period from March 31, 1952, to December 27 of that year, with provision for automatic extensions from year to year thereafter, but subject to arbitrary termination at any time on two weeks' written notice by either party. Dyke's agreement ran from April 12, 1953, to December 26 of that year. It had no automatic renewal clause, but was subject to arbitrary termination by either party on two weeks' written notice.\nEach contract provided for commission sales by the sales representative in respect of certain of the products of the appellant, with a minimum amount guaranteed. The sales representative agreed to pay his own expenses out of his remuneration. The agreement contemplated sales demonstrations being arranged and the possible employment of demonstrators and of junior salesmen. Each agreement provided that the sales representative would devote his entire time, best effort and full and undivided attention to the sale of the appellant's products in his territory, and the sales representative agreed to follow the appellant's instructions and expressed wishes in carrying out his work. The sales representatives did not have authority to make contracts on the appellant's behalf and did not keep in Quebec a supply of goods for delivery as a result of the sales which they made. Orders were filled from the appellant's plant in Ontario.\nComtois and Dyke each maintained an office in his own residence, but received no rent or added compensation from the appellant for so doing. Each provided his own office equipment, without compensation therefor from the appellant. The telephone directory did not list the sales representative's residence as the appellant's place of business and the residence did not carry any business signs. The appellant provided its sales representative with calling cards, showing that he was the appellant's representative.\nThe office of the sales representative was used by him for doing the paper work involved in his business. Some of the orders from distributors were obtained there. In addition, sales demonstrations were held there On occasions and demonstrators were trained there. For these purposes the evidence was that the sales representatives kept quantities of the appellant's products at their premises, ranging in value from some $4,000 to $11,000.\nOn this evidence I am not prepared to hold that the appellant had a \"permanent establishment\" in the Province of Quebec in the years in question. Interpreting those words, apart from the provisions of s. 411(1)(a) of the Regulations, my opinion is that the word \"establishment\" contemplates a fixed place of business of the corporation, a local habitation of its own. The word \"permanent\" means that the establishment is a stable one, and not of a temporary or tentative character.\nI now turn to s. 411(1) of the Regulations which, although already cited, I will repeat here:\n(a) \"permanent establishment\" includes branches, mines, oil wells, farms, timber lands, factories, workshops, warehouses, offices, agencies, and other fixed places of business;\nCounsel for the respondent contended that in this paragraph the word \"includes\" should be interpreted as meaning \"means and includes\". Counsel for the appellant argued that the definition contained in this paragraph was an expansive one. Both of them cited the judgment of Lord Watson in Dilworth v. The Commissioner of Stamps3.\nI do not think it is necessary to determine this point, in view of the fact that I interpret this paragraph as defining various kinds of places of business. All of the words used in this subsection, other than \"branches\" and \"agencies\", can have reference only to some form of real property. The paragraph concludes with the words \"and other fixed places of business\". When all the words of this paragraph are read together, in my opinion they are defining those kinds of places of business which constitute a permanent establishment.\nFrom the evidence it is clear that the appellant did not have any fixed place of business of its own. As a result of its contracts with Comtois and with Dyke, it had, and it only had, an employee, who was subject to dismissal on two weeks' notice, to act as its sales representative. I do not agree that the fact that such employee, for the discharge of his duties under his contract, set up an office in his own premises constituted that office a branch, an office or an agency of the appellant. It is the appellant who must have the permanent establishment in the Province of Quebec to qualify for the tax deduction and neither the office of Comtois nor that of Dyke was, in my opinion, a permanent establishment of the appellant.\nThe fact that the appellant had an employee or agent in Quebec was not, in itself, sufficient to constitute a permanent establishment of the appellant. This, I think, is made clear by para. (b) of s. 411(1) of the Regulations. An employee or agent can be deemed to operate a permanent establishment of a corporation under that paragraph, but only if he has authority to contract for his employer or principal, or if he has a stock of merchandise from which he regularly fills orders which he receives. Neither of these requirements was met in the present case.\nFinally, the appellant urged that it had a permanent establishment in Quebec, by virtue of subs. (2) of s. 411 of the Regulations, because its sales representatives had \"substantial machinery or equipment\", varying in value from $4,000 to $11,000, on their premises, in the tax years in question, which they used for sales demonstrations. I agree with Cameron J. that, as used in this subsection, the adjective \"substantial\" is intended to mean substantial in size and that the subsection was intended only to apply to machinery and equipment such as is used by contractors or builders in the course of their operations.\nIn any event, I do not agree that the use made by the sales representatives of the appellant's products for sales demonstration purposes constituted that kind of \"use\" which is contemplated by the subsection. In my opinion, in order to come within the subsection, the machinery or equipment would have to be used by the taxpayer for the purpose for which it was created. The appliances of the appellant, in the hands of its sales representatives, were not being used for any such purpose, but were merely being displayed, or operated for the purpose of demonstrating what their use was.\nFor these reasons, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Miller, Thomson, Hicks, Sedgewick, Lewis & Healy, Toronto.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

By clause 3 of his will made in 1918, the testator bequeathed to his widow the usufruct of all his property. By clause 4, it was stipulated that at the death of the widow or in the event of her remarriage, a sum of $1,000 together with all property passing to the testator by inheritance were to go to his legal heirs. By clause 5, it was stipulated that should the widow die childless and without having remarried, the property remaining after the execution of clause 4 was to be divided in equal shares between his legal heirs and the widow's legal heirs. The testator died in 1949 and was survived by his widow and their only child M. The latter died a few months later having appointed his wife, the present appellant, his universal legatee. The testator's wife died in 1957, childless and without having remarried. In her will she had appointed her brothers and sisters as universal residuary legatees.\nIn 1958, the legal heirs of the testator living at the time of the death of the widow instituted this action against the executors of the will of the widow, claiming the whole estate on the ground that the testator had, by clauses 4 and 5 of his will, created a substitution in their favour and which had opened at the death of the widow. The appellant was added to the action as a mise-en-cause and she alone defended the action. She claimed specifically that the will had created a usufruct and that title to the estate had passed to the testator's son at the death of the testator and to her at the death of the son.\nThe trial judge maintained the action and held that the will had created a substitution in favour of the testator's legal heirs living at the time of the death of the widow. The plaintiffs were declared to be entitled to the property described in clauses 4 and 5. The Court of Queen's Bench modified this judgment and held that \"legal heirs\" in clause 4 meant those living at the time of the testator's death (in this case, the son), and in clause 5 the \"legal heirs\" were those living at the time of the death of the widow. The Court held that clause 4 had created a usufruct in favour of the widow with title going to the son and that the appellant was entitled to that part of the estate. As to clause 5, the Court held that since the son had not survived his mother, he could not take under it whether a substitution or an usufruct had been created. The son's widow appealed to this Court and the plaintiffs cross-appealed.\nHeld: The appeal and the cross-appeal should be dismissed.\nAs to the property in clause 4, the testator's widow had received only the usufruct. By virtue of art. 864 of the Civil Code, the title passed to the testator's legal heirs at the time of his death, in this case his widow and his son. But, since the widow was only entitled to the usufruct, it was the son alone who took title which, at his death, passed to his wife, the appellant. In this case, there were double gifts taking effect simultaneously and without any lapse of time. (Aubertin v. Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, [1957] S.C.R. 643). The plaintiff's action could not be entertained as to that property.\nAs to the property in clause 5, it would appear that the testator's widow had more than an usufruct. Here there were two gifts firstly to the widow and secondly to the legal heirs of the testator and of the widow. These two gifts did not take effect simultaneously; they were successive and there was a lapse of time between their taking effect. A substitution de residuo was created in this case, and since the son died before its opening, he could not have acquired or passed any rights in that property to his wife. The plaintiffs were therefore entitled to it. The expression \"legal heirs\" used in clause 5 meant those alive at the time of the opening of the substitution which was at the time of the death of the testator's widow.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, modifying a judgment of St-Germain J.

Johnson, for the appellant.\nGeorges Sylvestre, Q.C., for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by Fautetjx J.:\u2014Le 7 avril 1949, Cl\u00e9ment Rondeau d\u00e9c\u00e9dait, laissant comme survivants imm\u00e9diats son \u00e9pouse, D\u00e9lia Gareau, et leur unique enfant, Maurice.

Au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de mon \u00e9pouse ou au cas de son convoi en d'autres noces, une somme de mille piastres ($1,000.00) et tous les autres biens qui me seront \u00e9chus par succession et dont il aura \u00e9t\u00e9 fait un \u00e9tat d\u00e9taill\u00e9 et asserment\u00e9 par madite \u00e9pouse avant son entr\u00e9e en jouissance, retourneront \u00e0 mes h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux, sans qu'elle puisse y pr\u00e9tendre aucun droit.\n5. Et alors dans le cas o\u00f9 mon \u00e9pouse d\u00e9c\u00e9derait sans enfants et sans s'\u00eatre remari\u00e9e, ce qui restera des biens de ma succession apr\u00e8s qu'il aura \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 mes h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux les biens qui me seront \u00e9chus par succession en plus d'une somme de mille piastres, sera partag\u00e9 en deux parts \u00e9gales dont l'une retournera \u00e0 mes h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux et l'autre aux h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux de mon \u00e9pouse.\n6. Au cas o\u00f9 elle convolerait en d'autres noces, elle n'aura que la jouissance, sa vie durant, de la moiti\u00e9 dudit r\u00e9sidu de mes biens, l'autre moiti\u00e9 devant \u00eatre pay\u00e9e \u00e0 mes h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux sans qu'elle puisse y pr\u00e9tendre aucun droit et au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de madite future \u00e9pouse la moiti\u00e9 dont elle aura eu la jouissance retournera \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux, \u00e0 l'exclusion de son \u00e9poux.\nMadite \u00e9pouse n'aura aucun droit \u00e0 la jouissance de cette moiti\u00e9 dans le cas o\u00f9 convolant en d'autres noces, il existerait un ou des enfants issus de notre mariage, lesquels enfants auront alors la jouissance et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 absolue de tous mes biens.\nLe fils de Cl\u00e9ment Rondeau, Maurice, d\u00e9c\u00e9da sans post\u00e9rit\u00e9 en 1949, quelques mois \u00e0 peine apr\u00e8s la mort de son p\u00e8re. Il \u00e9tait alors mari\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelante, Donalda Desrosiers, qu'il avait, par contrat de mariage, institu\u00e9e sa l\u00e9gataire universelle.\nLa veuve de Cl\u00e9ment Rondeau, D\u00e9lia Gareau, mourut en 1957 sans enfants et sans s'\u00eatre remari\u00e9e. Dans son dernier testament, elle d\u00e9signa ses fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs comme ses l\u00e9gataires universels r\u00e9siduaires.\nL'ann\u00e9e suivante, en 1958, les intim\u00e9s, h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux de Cl\u00e9ment Rondeau vivants au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son \u00e9pouse, D\u00e9lia Gareau, ou ayants droit d'iceux, \u00e9tant d'avis que Cl\u00e9ment Rondeau avait, aux paragraphes 4 et 5 de son testament, \u00e9tabli en leur faveur une substitution relativement aux biens y d\u00e9crits et que cette substitution s'\u00e9tait ouverte au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de D\u00e9lia Gareau, institu\u00e8rent aux ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires de celle-ci, W. Paradis et al, une action en p\u00e9tition d'h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9 pour se faire remettre chacun leur part de ces biens. Dans cette action, ils mirent en cause les autres h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux de Cl\u00e9ment Rondeau vivants au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son \u00e9pouse ou leurs ayants droit, ainsi que la veuve de Maurice Rondeau, l'appelante en cette cause. Seule, celle-ci contesta. Elle plaida particuli\u00e8rement\u2014et c'est l\u00e0 l'unique moyen \u00e0 retenir \u00e0 ce stade des proc\u00e9dures\u2014que le testament de Cl\u00e9ment Rondeau cr\u00e9ait en faveur de son \u00e9pouse, D\u00e9lia Gareau, non pas une substitution mais un simple usufruit sur les biens laiss\u00e9s, la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ces biens ayant \u00e9t\u00e9, au d\u00e9c\u00e8s du testateur, transmise \u00e0 son fils, Maurice Rondeau, et au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ce dernier, \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame, sa l\u00e9gataire universelle.\nLa Cour sup\u00e9rieure accueillit cette action pour le tout. Elle jugea que le testament cr\u00e9ait une substitution en faveur des h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux de Cl\u00e9ment Rondeau vivants au moment du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son \u00e9pouse, D\u00e9lia Gareau, et que cette substitution s'\u00e9tait ouverte au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de celle-ci. En cons\u00e9quence, la Cour ordonna aux ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires de remettre aux demandeurs chacun leur part des biens d\u00e9crits tant au paragraphe 4 qu'au paragraphe 5 du testament.\nPort\u00e9 en appel2 par la veuve de Maurice Rondeau, ce jugement fut modifi\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision majoritaire aux seules fins d'\u00e9carter du dispositif les biens d\u00e9crits au paragraphe 4 du testament. MM. les Juges Bissonnette, Rinfret et Choquette, de la majorit\u00e9, exprim\u00e8rent l'avis que l'expres- sion mes h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux\u00bb utilis\u00e9e pour d\u00e9signer les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires des dispositions du paragraphe 4 et ceux des dispositions du paragraphe 5 visaient, au paragraphe 4, les h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux de Cl\u00e9ment Rondeau vivants au moment de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, et, au paragraphe 5, ses h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux vivants au moment du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son \u00e9pouse. Donnant effet \u00e0 cette interpr\u00e9tation, ils jug\u00e8rent d'abord que le testateur avait, au paragraphe 4, \u00e9tabli, en faveur de son \u00e9pouse, un usufruit sur un legs \u00e0 titre universel d\u00e9volu, \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, \u00e0 ses propres h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux et qu'ayant manifestement exclu son \u00e9pouse de ce legs, son fils Maurice lui survivant avait, d\u00e8s la mort de son p\u00e8re, \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi de la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ces biens qu'il transmit lui-m\u00eame, \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse, Donalda Desrosiers. R\u00e9f\u00e9rant ensuite au paragraphe 5, les Juges de la majorit\u00e9 inclin\u00e8rent \u00e0 y voir une substitution relativement au r\u00e9sidu des biens mais ne jug\u00e8rent pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider la question, car le fils Maurice, n'ayant pas surv\u00e9cu \u00e0 l'\u00e9pouse de Cl\u00e9ment Rondeau demeur\u00e9e veuve, ne pouvait, vu le sens attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'expression \u00abmes h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux\u00bb dans ce paragraphe, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la disposition, qu'il s'agisse d'un usufruit (art. 901 C.C.) ou d'une substitution (art. 957 C.C.). Dissidents, MM. les Juges Owen et Montgomery auraient rejet\u00e9 l'appel. D'accord avec leurs coll\u00e8gues, ils jug\u00e8rent comme eux que l'expression \u00abmes h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux\u00bb au paragraphe 5 signifiait les h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux de Cl\u00e9ment Rondeau existant au moment du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son \u00e9pouse, mais contrairement aux juges de la majorit\u00e9, ils consid\u00e9r\u00e8rent que la m\u00eame expression au paragraphe 4 devait recevoir la m\u00eame signification qu'au paragraphe 5 et qu'en cons\u00e9quence, il y avait, comme en avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, une substitution dans les deux clauses.\nDe l\u00e0 un double pourvoi \u00e0 cette Cour: appel de Donalda Desrosiers pour obtenir le complet rejet de l'action des intim\u00e9s, et contre-appel de ces derniers pour faire r\u00e9tablir le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance tel que celui-ci fut modifi\u00e9 par un retraxit produit pour corriger une erreur qui s'\u00e9tait gliss\u00e9e dans le dispositif.\nIl s'agit donc d'interpr\u00e9ter les dispositions testamentaires pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es. Nonobstant les impr\u00e9cisions, ambigu\u00eft\u00e9s ou contradictions qu'on peut y relever, ces dispositions lorsque interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es les unes par les autres en donnant \u00e0 chacune le sens qui r\u00e9sulte de leur ensemble, justifient, je crois, l'opinion exprim\u00e9e par les juges de la majorit\u00e9 en Cour du banc de la reine sur la v\u00e9ritable intention du testateur.\nComme d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, Cl\u00e9ment Rondeau fit son dernier testament quelque trente ans avant son d\u00e9c\u00e8s et alors que lui et sa femme avaient un enfant de deux ans. Anticipant que le corpus de sa succession serait compos\u00e9 de deux parties distinctes de biens, la premi\u00e8re comprenant ceux qui lui seraient \u00e9chus par succession et la seconde les autres biens qu'il laisserait \u00e0 sa mort, il voulut faire une attribution diff\u00e9rente de chacune de ces deux parties. De plus et \u00e0 ces fins, il envisagea diverses \u00e9ventualit\u00e9s dont celle o\u00f9 son \u00e9pouse survivrait \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame et \u00e0 leur commune post\u00e9rit\u00e9 et demeurerait jusqu'\u00e0 d\u00e9c\u00e8s en \u00e9tat de viduit\u00e9. Au regard de cette \u00e9ventualit\u00e9, qui de fait s'est produite, il disposa comme ci-apr\u00e8s de ses biens.\nAu paragraphe 3, il constitue ce qui prima facie est un legs d'usufruit ayant pour objet tous les biens du corpus. Toutefois les termes de cette disposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sont par la suite contr\u00f4l\u00e9s par ceux des dispositions sp\u00e9ciales apparaissant aux paragraphes 4 et 5 visant sp\u00e9cifiquement la premi\u00e8re et la seconde partie des biens respectivement.\nRelativement aux biens qui lui seraient \u00e9chus par succession, et une somme de mille dollars, il ne l\u00e8gue \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse, D\u00e9lia Gareau, qu'un droit d'usufruit sa vie durant. Ceci appert clairement des dispositions du paragraphe 3 et du paragraphe 4 particuli\u00e8rement, en lequel il prescrit qu'avant d'entrer en jouissance de cette premi\u00e8re partie des biens, elle devra en faire un \u00e9tat d\u00e9taill\u00e9 et asserment\u00e9, et sp\u00e9cifie qu'au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son \u00e9pouse ou \u00e0 son convoi en d'autres noces, ces biens retourneront \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux \u00e0 lui, sans que celle-ci ne puisse y pr\u00e9tendre aucun droit. On retrouve, en plus, la confirmation de cette constitution d'usufruit aux dispositions du paragraphe 6. La veuve de Cl\u00e9ment Rondeau n'a donc aucun droit \u00e0 la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de cette partie des biens. Ce droit, qui durant la dur\u00e9e probl\u00e9matique de cet usufruit ne peut rester en suspens, serait, en l'esp\u00e8ce, au silence du testament, transmissible ab intestat aux h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux du testateur au moment de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, soit son \u00e9pouse et son fils. (Art. 864 C.C.). Celle-ci ne pouvant cependant pr\u00e9tendre \u00e0 d'autres droits que l'usufruit, seul le fils Maurice h\u00e9rita du droit \u00e0 la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'il transmit lui-m\u00eame, lors de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, \u00e0 l'appelante, sa l\u00e9gataire universelle Il y a donc eu, quant \u00e0 cette partie des biens, deux lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s, l'une d'usufruit et l'autre de nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant respectivement \u00e0 la veuve et au fils du testateur, toutes deux prenant effet simultan\u00e9ment d\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ce dernier. Il n'y a pas d'ordre successif ou le trait du temps entre ces deux lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s, contrairement \u00e0 ce qui est la situation dans le cas de la substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire o\u00f9 un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire gratifi\u00e9 en premier ordre doit, \u00e0 un terme donn\u00e9, rendre, en partie ou en totalit\u00e9, ce qu'il a re\u00e7u \u00e0 un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire gratifi\u00e9 en second ordre. Cette distinction entre l'essence de la constitution d'usufruit et celle de la substitution fid\u00e9icommissaire est clairement expos\u00e9e par notre coll\u00e8gue M. le Juge Taschereau dans Aubertin v. La Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al3. Il en r\u00e9sulte que l'action des intim\u00e9s quant \u00e0 cette partie des biens ne peut \u00eatre re\u00e7ue.\nQuant \u00e0 la seconde partie des biens, le testateur a bien, comme pour la premi\u00e8re partie, utilis\u00e9, dans la disposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du paragraphe 3, le mot \u00abusufruit\u00bb pour d\u00e9signer le legs b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse. Il appara\u00eet cependant, au m\u00eame paragraphe, que relativement \u00e0 cette seconde partie des biens, contrairement \u00e0 ce qui est le cas pour la premi\u00e8re partie, sa veuve n'est pas tenue de faire inventaire. De plus, le testateur exprime clairement au paragraphe 5 la volont\u00e9 que \u00abce qui restera\u00bb de cette partie des biens au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son \u00e9pouse sera alors partag\u00e9 en deux parts \u00e9gales dont l'une retournera \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux \u00e0 lui et l'autre aux h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux de son \u00e9pouse. Comme l'indique l'art. 928 C.C., une substitution peut exister quoique le terme d'usufruit a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 pour exprimer le droit du grev\u00e9, et c'est d'apr\u00e8s l'ensemble de l'acte et l'intention qui s'y trouve suffisamment manifest\u00e9e plut\u00f4t que d'apr\u00e8s l'acceptation ordinaire de certaines expressions qu'il est d\u00e9cid\u00e9 s'il y a ou non substitution. Les dispositions du paragraphe 5 n'ont pas pour objet la totalit\u00e9 des biens formant cette seconde partie du corpus, telle qu'existant au moment du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Cl\u00e9ment Rondeau, mais simplement \u00abce qui restera\u00bb de cette partie des biens au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de sa veuve et la fa\u00e7on dont il devra alors en \u00eatre dispos\u00e9. Il semble bien que Cl\u00e9ment Rondeau ait, quant \u00e0 cette seconde partie des biens, donn\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse plus qu'un simple usufruit, qu'il lui ait accord\u00e9 en plus le droit d'en faire certaines ali\u00e9nations. Comme le signale Migneault, Droit Civil Canadien, vol. 5, au bas de la page 88, en s'appuyant sur Th\u00e9venot d'Essaule, le fid\u00e9icom-mis de residuo s'\u00e9nonce ordinairement par la formule: Vous rendrez \u00e0 un tel, lors de votre d\u00e9c\u00e8s, ce qui restera de mes biens. Plus loin, \u00e0 la page 93, traitant de la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 des effets de la substitution d\u00e9pendant de la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 des termes la constituant, Migneault dit: \u00abS'il s'agit d'un v\u00e9ritable fid\u00e9icommis de residuo, c'est-\u00e0-dire de l'obligation impos\u00e9e au grev\u00e9 de rendre \u00e0 l'appel\u00e9 ce qui restera des biens . . . . . . . . . .\". Voir aussi Pothier, \u00e9dition Bugnet, vol. 8, Trait\u00e9 des Substitutions, n\u00b0 140, p. 502 et n\u00b0 149, p. 504. Ainsi donc, quant \u00e0 cette seconde partie des biens, il y a deux lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant, en premier ordre, \u00e0 la veuve et, en second ordre, aux h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux du de cujus et h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux de son \u00e9pouse, chaque ligne pour une moiti\u00e9. Ces deux lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s ne prennent pas effet simultan\u00e9ment; il y a un ordre successif ou le trait du temps entre chacune. Si donc, comme je le crois, apr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 attentivement tous les moyens soulev\u00e9s par le savant procureur de l'appelante, il s'agit ici d'une substitution de residuo, Maurice Rondeau, \u00e9poux de l'appelante, \u00e9tant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 avant l'ouverture de la substitution, n'a acquis et n'a pu cons\u00e9quemment transmettre aucun droit \u00e0 l'appelante quant \u00e0 cette partie des biens. Ce sont les intim\u00e9s qui ont droit d'en recueillir chacun leur part. De plus, je partage l'opinion, exprim\u00e9e en Cour d'Appel, qu'au paragraphe 5 le testateur s'est pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 de la d\u00e9volution des biens y mentionn\u00e9s telle qu'elle devait se faire, non pas au moment de son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, mais \u00e0 celui de son \u00e9pouse, et que l'expression \u00abmes h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux\u00bb se r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 ses h\u00e9ritiers l\u00e9gaux qui seraient alors vivants.\nJe renverrais l'appel et le contre-appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the appellant: Corbeil & Johnson, Montreal.\nAttorney for the respondents: G.

VI, c. 53, s. 13. The Crown's application for a stated case was made six days after the acquittal was granted instead of within four days as required by Rule 13 of the Crown Office Rules (Criminal). When the stated case came on for hearing before Lord J., an application was made on behalf of the Crown to extend the time for applying for the said stated case, which application was refused and the appeal by way of stated case dismissed on the ground that the case was not stated within the time prescribed. Upon appeal to the Court of Appeal the matter was referred back to the Supreme Court for reconsideration.\nThe application that the time for applying for the stated case be extended was subsequently dismissed by Wilson J. The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal from the latter decision and ordered that the time for applying for the stated case be extended and that the stated case be remitted to the Supreme Court for hearing and disposal. From this judgment the applicant applied for leave to appeal to this Court.\nHeld: The application should be dismissed.\nThe power conferred on this Court by s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act to grant leave to appeal from judgments relating to offences other than indictable offences is limited to cases in which the judgment sought to be appealed is that of a court acquitting or convicting an accused or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal. The judgment of the Court of Appeal in the present case did none of these things. For the time being the acquittal of the applicant remained standing; the effect of the judgment of the Court of Appeal was not to set it aside but to require a judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia to hear and dispose of the stated case on its merits and therefore to decide whether the acquittal should be set aside or affirmed. Paul v. The Queen, [1960] S.C.R. 452, followed.\nAPPLICATION for leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. Application dismissed.\nW. J. Wallace, for the applicant.\nD. Walker, for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an application for leave to appeal to this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia pronounced on May 1, 1962, and entered on October 3, 1962.\nOn August 11, 1960, the applicant was acquitted by a deputy police magistrate in and for the City of Vancouver on two charges of evading payment of income tax. The sole ground of acquittal was that the proceedings against the applicant, having been instituted more than six months after the time when the subject-matter of the proceedings arose, were barred by the provisions of s. 693(2) of the Criminal Code, despite the provisions of s. 80(4) of the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 97 as amended by 11-12 George VI, c. 53, s. 13, which provided:\n(4) An information or complaint under Part XV of the Criminal Code in respect of an offence under this section or section forty-six A may be laid or made within five years from the time when the matter of the information or complaint arose or within one year from the day on which evidence, sufficient in the opinion of the Minister to justify a prosecution for the offence, came to his knowledge, and the Minister's certificate as to the day on which such evidence came to his knowledge is conclusive evidence thereof.\nOn August 17, 1960, an application was made on behalf of the Attorney General for Canada to the learned deputy magistrate to state a case pursuant to s. 734 of the Criminal Code.\nAt that date the procedure to be followed was governed by the Crown Office Rules (Criminal) of the Province of British Columbia, Rule 13 of which read:\n13. Every application by a party aggrieved to a Justice to state a case shall be made within four days after the order, determination, or other proceeding has been made or rendered, or within such further time as may be allowed by the Court or a Judge.\nOn September 9, 1960, a case was stated by the learned deputy police magistrate and notice dated September 16, 1960, that a case had been stated and was to be heard in the Supreme Court of British Columbia on November 1, 1960, was served on the applicant.\nOn November 1, 1960, the hearing of the stated case was adjourned by the presiding judge in chambers pending the result of the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, taken from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta in The Queen v. Machacek[1].\nBy judgment of this Court pronounced on January 24, 1961, the appeal in Machacek's case was allowed. This judgment is reported in [1961] S.C.R. 163.\nThe stated case came on for hearing before Lord J. on February 21, 1961, at which time an application was made on behalf of the Attorney General, pursuant to Rule 13, supra, to extend the time for applying for the said stated case, which application was refused and the appeal by way of stated case dismissed on the ground that the case was not stated within the time prescribed.\nBy notice, dated March 1, 1961, an appeal was entered in the Court of Appeal for British Columbia from the judgment of Lord J. and by judgment of the Court of Appeal[2] pronounced on June 12, 1961, the appeal was allowed and it was ordered that the stated case be remitted back to the Supreme Court to consider whether the time for applying for the stated case should be extended and if so to hear the said stated case.\nThe application that the time for applying for the stated case be extended to August 17, 1960, came on for hearing before Wilson J. on September 13, 1961, and that learned judge dismissed the application, giving the following oral reasons:\nIf it (the hearing of the stated case herein) had gone on then (the 1st day of November, 1960) he would have been not guilty. If the matter had come on before me, I would not have granted an adjournment, not in a criminal case. I am going to refuse the application.\nThe formal order of Wilson J. reads as follows:\nUPON THE APPLICATION of the appellant by the Attorney General of Canada, in the presence of J. S. Maguire, Esq., Q.C. of counsel for the appellant, and W. J. Wallace, Esq. of counsel for the respondent; AND UPON HEARING counsel aforesaid;\nIT IS ORDERED that the application be and the same is hereby dismissed.\nIt is clear that Wilson J. dealt with the question whether the extension of time should be granted and having decided that it should not he did not deal with the stated case on its merits. Notice of motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal from the judgment of Wilson J. was filed and served on September 27, 1961. On May 1, 1962, the Court of Appeal granted leave to appeal, allowed the appeal and ordered:\nThat the time for applying for the Stated Case herein be and the same is hereby extended to and including the 17th day of August, A.D. 1960; and that the Stated Case be remitted to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for hearing of the Stated Case herein, and disposal of it according to law.\nIt is from this judgment of the Court of Appeal that the applicant now asks leave to appeal on a number of grounds including the following:\nThe Court of Appeal in hearing the appeal brought by the present plaintiff (respondent) from the decision of the Honourable Mr. Justice Wilson exceeded its jurisdiction under Section 743(1) in that the question whether the learned Judge properly exercised his discretion in refusing to extend the time for stating a case is not a question of law alone.\nNo reference to the question of its jurisdiction is made in the reasons for judgment given orally by the Court of Appeal.\nThe application to this Court is met in limine by the objection that we are without jurisdiction. To this it is answered that jurisdiction is conferred by s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act.\nThe reasons of the majority of this Court in Paul v. The Queen[3] appear to me to hold that on the true construction of s. 41 the power thereby conferred on this Court to grant leave to appeal from judgments relating to offences other than indictable offences is limited to cases in which the judgment sought to be appealed is that of a court acquitting or convicting an accused or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal. The judgment of the Court of Appeal of May 1, 1962, does none of these things. For the time being the acquittal of the applicant stands; the effect of the judgment of the Court of Appeal is not to set it aside but to require a judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia to hear and dispose of the stated case on its merits and thereby to decide whether the acquittal shall be set aside or affirmed. In these circumstances it is my opinion that we are bound by the judgment in Paul v. The Queen, supra, to hold that we are without jurisdiction to grant the leave sought by the applicant.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss this application.\nApplication dismissed.\nSolicitors for the applicant: Bull, Housser, Tupper, Ray, Guy & Merritt, Vancouver.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Clark, Wilson, White, Clark & Maguire, Vancouver.\n[1] (1960) 32 W.W.R. 73, 33 C.R. 283, 127 C.C.C. 418; reversed, [1961] S.C.R. 163, 34 C.R. 299, 129 C.C.C. 1.\n[2] (1961), 35 W.W.R. 525, 35 C.R. 406, 131 C.C.C. 72.\n[3] [1960] S.C.R. 452, 34 C.R. 110, 127 C.C.C. 129.\n",

Some months before, the hotel had been seriously damaged by fire and temporarily repaired. The Crown held title for some 22 months and then, by appropriate notice under s. 24 of the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 106, abandoned most of the property, including the hotel, which revested in the suppliant. The latter remained in possession after the expropriation and continued to carry on its business without paying rent. Permanent reconstruction of the building, for which plans had been prepared, was not proceeded with until after the notice of abandonment.\nIn 1956, by its petition of right, the suppliant made a claim for damages incurred as a result of the expropriation and as compensation for the land taken and not revested. The trial judge awarded $28,600 for loss of profits for the 22 months; $3,500 representing the architect's fees for the preparation of plans for additions to the hotel, proposed prior to the expropriation; $6,021 (plus ten per cent for compulsory taking) for the value of the land retained; and $1,500 for injurious affection resulting from the loss of a right-of-way. In addition, he ordered that certain valuation and legal fees be determined on taxation by the registrar. The suppliant appealed to this Court and the Crown moved to vary the judgment.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed and the motion to vary allowed in part. Kerwin C.J. and Locke J. (dissenting in part) would not have allowed anything for compensation for the expropriation in view of its subsequent withdrawal.\nPer Curiam: The amount of $6,021 for the land retained (but, in view of Drew v. The Queen, [1961] S.C.R. 614, without the ten per cent allowance for compulsory taking) and the amount of $1,500 for the deprivation of the right-of-way should not be altered. There was no reason to interfere with the disposition of the valuation and legal fees as made by the trial judge.\nPer Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ: The fact that the whole or part of the expropriated land was returned to the owner did not change the nature of the owner's claim for compensation; it remained a claim under s. 23 of the Expropriation Act against the compensation which stands in the stead of the land, and under s. 24 of the Act the revesting was to be taken into account in assessing the amount to be paid. Hence, the value of the land as of the date of expropriation must be set against the value of the land revested as of the date of the revestment. In the circumstances of this case, there should be added to the fair market value of the property expropriated an allowance for business disturbance, in this case of $25,000. Had it not been for the revesting this allowance might have been higher. This allowance should be added to the market value of the property at the date of expropriation. Then from the total arrived at should be deducted the fair market value of the land retained. By that process, the suppliant was entitled to received $30,501.\nPer Kerwin C.J., dissenting in part: Since the suppliant never attempted to move its business there was no basis for giving anything for loss of business. In addition to the $6,021 for the value of the land retained by the Crown and the $1,500 for the deprivation of the right-of-way, the suppliant was entitled as a separate item to the sum of $3,500 for drawing plans, etc.\nPer Locke J., dissenting in part: The loss of possible profits amounting to $28,600 awarded by the trial judge could not be allowed as a deduction from the value of the property at the date of the abandonment. The suppliant was entitled under s. 24(4) of the Act to be compensated for such loss as was shown to have been sustained by it which was attributable to the fact that it was deprived of title to the property for a period of 22 months. If there was any loss of profits during that period the suppliant had no claim for compensation, since such loss was occasioned by its voluntary act in remaining in possession rent free. If there was any legal basis for such a claim, the evidence did not support any award. Furthermore, the sum of $3,500 allowed by the trial judge as the fees of the architect should not have been awarded. The suppliant could have availed itself of the benefit of these plans after the notice of abandonment had it wished to do so, and suffered no loss attributable to the expropriation. APPEAL by the suppliant from and motion to vary a judgment of Kearney J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada1, awarding compensation in a matter of expropriation. Appeal dismissed and motion to vary allowed in part (Kerwin C.J. and Locke J. dissenting in part).\nJ. G. Ahern, Q.C., and H. J. Maloney, Q.C., for the suppliant, appellant.\nP. M. Ollivier, for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting in part):\u2014This is an appeal by Standish Hall Hotel Incorporated from a judgment of the Exchequer Court1, dated March 15, 1960, in proceedings commenced therein by the appellant by petition of right. The respondent gave a notice to vary the judgment.\nIt is important to set forth the substance of the formal judgment:\n(a) It ordered that $6,623 with interest from July 19, 1952, to the date of judgment was sufficient and just compensation for the taking by the respondent of part of Lot 304 in Ward II, District of Hull, Quebec, containing 2,007 sq. ft., and for any loss occasioned to the owner or any other person having interest in the land on July 19, 1952, \"the said sum of Six Thousand Six Hundred and Twenty-Three Dollars ($6,623) to include the allowance for forceable taking\";\n(b) That the appellant recover from the respondent $31,600 with interest from May 18, 1954, to the date of judgment \"as compensation for the expropriation and subsequent revesting of the lands described as parts of Lot 304, 306 and 307 in Ward II, District of Hull, Quebec, having a total area of Eighty-six Thousand Five Hundred and Thirty-six Square Feet (86,536 sq. ft.) less the Two Thousand and Seven Square Feet (2,007 sq ft.) aforesaid\";\n(c) It ordered \"that the sum of One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500) with interest from the 19th day of July, A.D. 1952 to the date hereof is a sufficient and just allowance for injurious affection for the deprivation of a registered servitude consisting of a right of passage over lands adjoining the said lands hereinbefore referred to\";\n(d) It ordered that the appellant recover such further amounts \"in respect of assessors and legal fees as may be determined on taxation by the Registrar\";\n(e) It ordered that the respondent pay the appellant the costs of the action.\nOn July 19, 1952, the appellant was the owner of lands in Hull, in the Province of Quebec, upon which was erected the Standish Hall Hotel. On that date this property was expropriated by the respondent under the provisions of the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 64. On May 18, 1954, the respondent abandoned the expropriation of this land except a small part at the south-eastern extremity, which is the part described in (a) of the summary of judgment set forth above. In the meantime, on July 14, 1953, the respondent had filed an information to have the amount of compensation determined under the expropriation of July 19, 1952, but no further proceedings have been taken. At the hearing of the present action it was agreed by counsel that the information by the respondent should be dismissed without costs but it was also agreed that the account of the late Senator Beauregard for legal services against the appellant and also the amount paid to the expert (W. E. Noffke) in connection with the first expropriation \"should not be prejudiced\". The Court thereupon directed that \"this expense will be attached to the petition of right\". Subject to this the information by the respondent need not be further considered.\nThe account of Senator Beauregard was referred to the registrar for taxation and the trial judge considered the claim of W. E. Noffke of $11,800, allowed it at $3,500, but, after some hesitation, placed it in the same category as, (and therefore included it in), the allowance of $31,600 he granted as \"Loss of business caused by the expropriation\". Counsel for the appellant argued that Noffke's account should have been fixed at $4,400 but subject to that is satisfied with the amount fixed by the trial judge under heading (b), although claiming other amounts in connection with other items which were disallowed. On the other hand, the respondent takes the position that if the petition of right is maintained and the appellant awarded compensation, the appellant is entitled to assessor's fees as part of the costs of the cause and to the amount allowed for Noffke's account.\nAs to the small bit of land referred to in (a) above, we are all of. opinion that no reason has been shown to alter the value placed upon it by the trial judge, $6,021. However, in view of the decision of this Court in Drew v. Her Majesty the Queen2, ten per cent of that sum which the trial judge allowed for forceable taking cannot stand. This item is therefore reduced to $6,021. Similarly we are all of opinion that the value of the servitude referred to in (c) should not be increased from the $1,500 allowed by the trial judge. The \"assessors and legal fees\" in (d) refer to the account of Senator Beauregard and to whatever may be properly allowable to Noffke as a witness at the trial. It does not include anything for Noffke's account of $11,800 for preparing plans after the expropriation because while the trial judge in his reasons shows that he considered that it should be fixed at $3,500, he did not allow it specifically, as he had included the $3,500 in the sum of $31,600 mentioned in (b). I would not interfere with the trial judge's disposition of the fees of assessors (which include Noffke's) and of Senator Beauregard's account, but, as I consider no allowance should be made for what I understand the trial judge has fixed as damages, I would allow the $3,500 as a separate item.\nThe appellant did not move its hotel business to another site and therefore I am unable to concur with the trial judge that anything is allowable \"in equity\". The appellant remained in possession of the hotel property and carried on business, paying no rent, and according to the exhibits filed at the trial as to which there was no cross-examination, paying taxes and insurance premiums. The trial judge fixed the value of the lands as of the date of expropriation and the value as of the date of abandonment, finding the latter to be slightly in excess of the former. There is no basis for giving the appellant anything for loss of business as it never attempted to move its business.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs, allow the motion to vary with costs and in lieu of the judgment below direct that it read as follows:\n1. That it be ordered and adjudged that $6,021 with interest from July 19, 1952, to the date of judgment, March 15, 1960, was sufficient and just compensation for the taking by the respondent of part of lot 304 in ward II, District of Hull, Quebec, containing 2,007 sq. ft., and for any loss occasioned to the owner or any other person having interest in the land on July 19, 1952.\n2. That the sum of One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500) with interest from the 19th day of July, A.D. 1952 to March 15, 1960, is a sufficient and just allowance for injurious affection for the deprivation of a registered servitude consisting of a right of passage over lands adjoining the lands expropriated.\n3. That the appellant recover such further amounts in respect of assessors and legal fees as may be determined on; taxation by the registrar.\n4. That the appellant recover the sum of $3,500 for the services of W. E. Noffke for drawing plans, etc.\n5. That the respondent pay the appellant the costs of the action.\nThe judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux and Abbott JJ. was delivered by\nAbbott J.:\u2014The appellant has appealed, and the Crown has moved to vary, a judgment of the Exchequer Court3, rendered on March 15, 1960, awarding to appellant the sum of $39,723 as compensation for its property and in addition certain valuation and legal fees to be determined on taxation by the registrar.\nThe facts are fully set forth in the judgment of the learned trial judge and for the purposes of this appeal can be shortly stated.\nThe appellant is the owner and operator of the Standish Hall Hotel which is situated close to the centre of the main business section of Hull. It has frontage on three important streets, namely 293.8' on rue Principale to the south, 190.5' on rue Montcalm to the west and 184.4' on Wellington St. to the north. The eastern boundary, being part of lot 304, measures 351'. The total area of the land is approximately 84,700 sq. ft.\nOn July 19, 1952, the above property along with other property to the east of it was expropriated by Her Majesty the Queen under the authority of the former Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 64.\nOn May 18, 1954, twenty-two months later, the Crown abandoned the expropriation of the appellant's property with the exception of a small area of vacant land measuring approximately 2007 sq. ft. and situated at the southeastern extremity of the land. Appellant remained in possession of the property during the full period of expropriation, continued to carry on its business there and paid no rent. Some months before the notice of expropriation was given on July 19, 1952, the buildings on the property had been seriously damaged by fire and temporary repairs were made prior to that date. Permanent reconstruction of the buildings, for which plans had been prepared, was not proceeded with however, until after the notice of abandonment was given by the Crown on May 18, 1954.\nOn January 7, 1956, appellant took a petition of right against the Crown claiming $584,330.61 as damages incurred as a result of the expropriation and as compensation for the land taken and not revested.\nBoth the appeal and the motion to vary turn upon the interpretation and effect to be given to ss. 23 and 24 of the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 106, which read:\n23. The compensation money agreed upon or adjudged for any land or property acquired or taken for or injuriously affected by the construction of any public work shall stand in the stead of such land or property; and any claim to or encumbrance upon such land or property shall, as respects Her Majesty, be converted into a claim to such compensation money or to a proportionate amount thereof, and shall be void as respects any land or property so acquired or taken, which shall, by the fact of the taking possession thereof, or the filing of the plan and description, as the case may be, become and be absolutely vested in Her Majesty.\n24. (1) Whenever, from time to time, or at any time before the compensation money has been actually paid, any parcel of land taken for a public work, or any portion of any such parcel, is found to be unnecessary for the purposes of such public work, or if it is found that a more limited estate or interest therein only is required, the Minister may, by writing under his hand, declare that the land or such portion thereof is not required and is abandoned by the Crown, or that it is intended to retain only such limited estate or interest as is mentioned in such writing.\n(2) Upon such writing being registered in the office of the registrar of deeds for the county or registration division in which the land is situate, such land declared to be abandoned shall revest in the person from whom it was taken or in those entitled to claim under him.\n(3) In the event of a limited estate or interest therein being retained by the Crown, the land shall so revest subject to the estate or interest so retained.\n(4) The fact of such abandonment or revesting shall be taken into account, in connection with all the other circumstances of the case, in estimating or assessing the amount to be paid to any person claiming compensation for the land taken. The meaning and effect of these two sections was considered by this Court and by the Judicial Committee in Gibb v. The King4, and Fitzpatrick C.J. (whose judgment was declared to be correct in all respects by the Judicial Committee) at p. 407 said:\nThe values of the land at the date of the expropriation and at the date of the abandonment have to be ascertained in the ordinary way but otherwise, in my view, it is immaterial to inquire what were the causes of the value of the land at these dates.\nThe value of the land at the time of the expropriation is ordinarily the compensation which the owner is entitled to claim. I refer to sc. 47 of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" and also to the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Cedar Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste (1914) A.C. 569, to the effect that the compensation to be paid for land expropriated is the value to the owner as it existed at the date of the taking. If, by the inverse process to expropriation, the Minister forcibly vests the property in him again, the value of the land to the owner at the time of such revesting is an element to be considered in estimating the amount to be paid to him.\nThe fact that the whole or some portion of the land expropriated has been returned to the person from whom it was taken, does not change the nature of the owner's claim for compensation. It remains a claim under s. 23 of the Expropriation Act against the compensation money which stands in the stead of the land. As Lord Buckmaster said in Gibb v. The King, supra, at p. 922:\nEven after revesting, the claim for compensation still remains open for adjustment, for it has nowhere been taken away or satisfied, and in its settlement the effect of the revesting is an element to be considered.\nTheir Lordships are therefore unable to accept the view that the true measure of the appellant's right is something in the nature of a claim for damages for disturbing or injuriously affecting. In fact, so far as the particular piece of land is concerned, the Crown does not appear to have done any act upon the land itself that would either damage or injuriously affect its value. Its advisers have been enabled by virtue of the section to change their mind and give back the property which they originally took, and it is this fact which must be considered with other circumstances in determining the original amount of compensation which they became liable to pay.\nIt follows that in a case such as this the tribunal of fact must first determine in accordance with well-established principles, the value of the land to the owner as of the date of the expropriation and the value of the land revested must also be determined as at the date of revestment. If the latter value is equal to or exceeds the value of what was taken, the owner is then in the position of having received in property \"the equivalent in value to him of the property taken as of the date when sec. 23 became operative\" to adopt the words used by Duff J. in Gibb v. The King, supra, at p. 429.\nThe learned trial judge found the fair market value of the property at the date of expropriation to have been $440,743, and some twenty-two months later at the date of revesting to have been $441,263. There is ample evidence to support those findings and they should be accepted.\nTo each of these amounts however, he added $100,000 as \"a value in equity\" to appellant of the business conducted on the property. He therefore fixed the value of the property to appellant as owner, at the date of expropriation, at $540,743.\nAs I have stated, at the date of revesting he found the market value of the property to be $441,263 (an increase of $520) to which he added the sum $100,000 just referred to. From that total of $541,263 he deducted $28,600 for loss of profits during the twenty-two month period and $3,500 for the cost of certain plans prepared for appellant but not used, and fixed the value to the owner at the date of revesting at $509,163.\nThe effect of these calculations was of course to award to appellant a sum of $28,600 as damages for loss of profits and a sum of $3,500 representing the cost of certain plans.\nIn the result the learned trial judge held that appellant was \"entitled to succeed to the extent of $31,600 being the depreciation in value to the owner which the instant property suffered in the twenty-two month period during which the respondent retained title to it\". To this sum he added (1) $6,623 (which included 10 per cent for forcible taking) as the value of the small portion of land retained by the Crown, (2) $1,500 for injurious affection due to loss of a right of way, and fixed the total compensation due by respondent at $39,723.\nWith deference, I am unable to agree that the compensation to which appellant may be entitled can properly be ascertained in this way.\nThe principles applicable in determining compensation are well established, and were re-stated by this Court in Woods Manufacturing Co. v. The King5. The rule is that the owner at the moment of expropriation is deemed as without title, but all else remaining the same, and the question is what would he, as a prudent man, at that moment, pay for the property rather than be ejected from it.\nIn the Woods case, in Diggon-Hibben Ltd. v. The King6, and in other cases decided by this Court, it has been held that in appropriate circumstances value to the owner includes an allowance for business disturbance. Appellant was without title to the property for some twenty-two months although it continued in possession, apparently with the consent of the Crown. In these circumstances, I think that an allowance for business disturbance should be made in fixing the compensation to which appellant was entitled but, under the terms of s. 24(4) of the Expropriation Act, the tribunal of fact in fixing the amount of such allowance must take into account the re-vesting and the fact that appellant continued to carry on business on the property.\nAs my brother Locke pointed out in Drew v. The Queen7, such an allowance is in the nature of unliquidated damages and, except in very rare circumstances, cannot be determined with complete accuracy. In all the circumstances here, in my opinion an allowance of $25,000 for business dislocation is fully adequate and the value of the property to appellant as owner at the date of expropriation could not exceed its fair market value plus the amount of such an allowance. In my view, had it not been for the revesting such an allowance for business disturbance might well have been substantially higher than $25,000. The learned trial judge found the market value of the property at the date of expropriation to be $440,743. I would therefore fix the value to appellant as owner at that date at $465,743.\nTo arrive at the compensation to which appellant is entitled, from the said amount of $465,743 must be deducted the value of the land revested in appellant and for that purpose, in my opinion, the value of such land should be its fair market value at the date of revesting.\nAs I have stated, the learned trial judge found the market value of the whole property at the date of revesting to have been $441,263. He fixed the market value of the small portion retained by the Crown at $6,021, and in view of the decision in Drew v. The Queen, supra, there should be no allowance for compulsory taking. Deducting the said amount of $6,021 from the fair market value of the whole property at the date of revesting leaves a sum of $435,242 which represented the value of the property revested in the appellant. On May 18, 1954, the date of revesting, the appellant was entitled therefore to receive from respondent the sum of $30,501. Appellant should also receive the sum of $1,500 for injurious affection resulting from loss of a right-of-way as found by the trial judge. In the result, appellant is entitled to receive as compensation the sum of $32,001, with interest as from July 19, 1952, on the above amounts of $6,021 and $1,500, and as from May 18, 1954, on the balance.\nThe learned trial judge held that certain claims made by appellant for valuation and legal fees incurred in connection with the expropriation, should be referred to the registrar for assessment and taxation, and I see no reason for interfering with that disposition of these two claims.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs and allow in part the motion to vary with costs. The judgment is amended by striking out the words and figures \"Six Thousand, Six Hundred and Twenty-three Dollars ($6,623)\" wherever they appear in the first operative clause of the judgment and inserting in lieu thereof the words and figures \"Six Thousand and Twenty-one Dollars ($6,021)\". The judgment is also amended by striking out the words and figures in the second operative clause \"Thirty-one Thousand, Six Hundred Dollars ($31,600)\" and inserting in lieu thereof \"Twenty-four Thousand, Four Hundred and Eighty Dollars ($24,480)\".\nLocke J. (dissenting in part):\u2014This is an appeal by the suppliant, and a cross-appeal on behalf of the Crown, from a judgment8 of Kearney J. awarding compensation to the appellant by reason of the expropriation by the Crown of a hotel property in the city of Hull. The expropriation was subsequently abandoned under the provisions of s. 24(1) of the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 106. By the judgment appealed from, the appellant was awarded sums aggregating $39,723 and such further amounts as might be determined on taxation by the registrar for the services of an expert witness and for legal fees incurred in the circumstances to be hereafter mentioned.\nThe appellant is the owner of lands in the city of Hull upon which the Standish Hall hotel is built, which is and was at the relevant times operated as such. These operations were shown to have been profitable in five of the six years prior to August 1951 when a large area of the southern part of the hotel was damaged by fire. Repairs were made in that year which permitted the continuation of the business and the retention of the liquor licence, shown to be a valuable asset.\nThe notice of expropriation was given on July 19, 1952, and the notice of abandonment on May 18, 1954. The abandonment was not of the entire property, there being excepted a small area of vacant land containing 2,007 square feet situated along the south eastern limit of the land, and the value of this property is one of the matters in issue. The Crown permitted the appellant to remain in possession and to operate its business throughout this period without payment of any rent.\nAn information for the purpose of determining the compensation to be paid was exhibited by the Attorney General in the Exchequer Court on July 14, 1953, but it does not appear that this was served and, for reasons unexplained, the matter was not proceeded with by the Crown.\nOn July 5, 1956, the appellant filed a petition of right claiming a sum of $584,330.61 as compensation for damages claimed to have been suffered. The particulars of this claim were as follows:\n1. For loss of good will and patronage due to inability to rebuild: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. $160,000.\n2. For loss of revenue for 22 months at $1,841.55 a month: 40,514.61\n3. For loss of additional revenue from additions to the hotel, said to have been proposed prior to the expropriation during the 22 months' interval:............................................................ 220,140.\n4. For the cost of temporary repairs to the premises:\u2026\u2026\u2026.... 24,000.\n5. For architect's fees for the plans of the proposed addition mentioned in No. 3 above:\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 11,800.\n6. For additional cost of the construction of an addition built in 1955 over 1952 prices: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026... 26,250.\n7. For costs involved in expropriation proceedings: 29,500. being $7,000. legal fees and \"owner's expropriation expert's fee\" W. E. Noffke \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. $22,500. 8. For value of 2,007 square feet retained:\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 36,126.\n9. For loss of a right-of-way over the western part of a lot\nadjoining the property to the east: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 36,000.\nThe claims were dealt with separately by the learned trial judge in a carefully considered judgment.\nKearney J. found that there was no sufficient evidence of loss to justify any allowance in respect of the claim under head 1 above.\nIn respect of the claim for loss of profits under head 2, the learned judge held that there had been a loss of $28,600 during the period of 22 months.\nDealing with the loss of additional profits under head 3, he found that the suppliant had failed to establish that but for the expropriation proceedings he would have proceeded with the larger structure, which made further consideration of the claim unnecessary.\nThe claim for expenditures for repairs made following the fire under head 4 was dismissed.\nThe sum of $11,800 claimed as architect's fees for the preparation of the plans for the large addition said to have been contemplated under head 5 was allowed at $3,500.\nThe claim for the additional cost of building the addition to the hotel, constructed after the abandonment of the expropriation, over the cost of such work in 1952 under head 6 was considered in connection with the valuation of the property on revesting.\nThe claim for the services of Mr. Noffke as a valuator and the claim of $7,000 for legal fees, said to have been incurred in connection with the information that was not proceeded with, under head 7 were referred to the registrar for taxation.\nFor the area retained by the Crown the learned judge allowed $6,021 and, in addition, ten per cent for forcible dispossession (head 8).\nFor the loss of the right-of-way under head 9 $1,500 was allowed.\nWhile Mr. E. S. Sherwood, called as an expert witness as to values on behalf of the Crown, and Mr. Noffke, who in addition to being an architect was shown to be experienced in valuing land, differed widely as to the value of the lands taken, they were agreed that the property was greater in value at the date the expropriation was abandoned than when expropriated. Sherwood's valuation of the land and buildings as of the date of the expropriation was $440,743 and as of the date of abandonment $458,050. The learned, trial judge accepted the first of these valuations but said that he considered the value at the time of abandonment to be $441,263, the difference being caused by an error made by the witness in the percentage of increase in building costs as between the two dates. I have examined with care the evidence of these two witnesses and I respectfully agree with the conclusion of the learned trial judge that these figures represent the value of the property at the respective dates. While the witness did not state that this was market value, I think it clear that this is what was intended and it was so found by Kearney J.\nThe reasons for judgment, after saying that market value did not represent the value to the suppliant at these dates, read in part:\nI consider that as of July 19, 1952, the business as a going concern had, exclusive of fixed assets, a value in equity to the suppliant of approximately $100,000. This amount added to $440,743 would raise its value at the time of expropriation to $540,743. In my view, the value to the suppliant of the property on revesting had depreciated because of deprivation of profits amounting to $28,600 plus the sum of $3,500 which I would allow for the cost of plans less the sum of $520 previously referred to, and I would accordingly fix the value of the property to its owner as of May 18, 1954, at $509,163. Because of the foregoing factors included in items (2), (5) and (6) of its claim, I think the suppliant is entitled to succeed to the extent of $31,600 being the depreciation in value to the owner which the instant property suffered in the twenty-two month period during which the respondent retained title to it.\nNo further details than those above stated were given as to the manner in which the learned judge arrived at the figure of $100,000. While the reference is to \"the value in equity to the suppliant\", I construe this portion of the judgment as a finding that this amount, added to the market value, was the value to the owner at the respective dates. I do not think the use of the expression \"a going concern\" was intended to mean that the value of the business itself which was not, of course, expropriated, as distinct from the property on which it was carried on, was $100,000. The learned judge had in the course of his judgment referred to Cedars Rapids v. Lacoste9, dealing with another aspect of the matter and, in my opinion, it should be taken that the sum of these two amounts was, in his opinion, the value to the owner with all the advantages which the land possessed, present or future, the compensation to which an owner is entitled as stated at p. 576 of the report of that case.\nIn cases such as Diggon-Hibben Ltd. v. The King10, and Woods Manufacturing Co. v. The King11, substantial allowances were made for the dislocation of the business carried on due to the dispossession and the cost of establishing it in new premises, but there was nothing of this kind in the present case as there was no evidence that the appellant proposed to establish a hotel business elsewhere and it elected to remain on the premises carrying on its business and the expropriation did not either interrupt it or cause any added expense. Rather was the expense diminished by reason of the exemption from municipal taxation on the land. Since nothing of that nature could accordingly be included in the allowance made, it would appear that the learned judge added the amount of $100,000 as the added value to the owner, owing to the suitability of the premises and their location for the carrying on of a hotel business by it. Since the value of the land was greater when returned than when taken, the only importance of the allowance is its bearing upon the consideration of the amounts allowed for loss of profit.\nThus, in the result, the suppliant has been awarded not merely the full value to it of the lands taken less the value of the property when returned to it but, in addition, $28,600 for loss of profits it might have made had additions to the hotel costing $175,000 been made, similar to those that were proceeded with after the abandonment in the year 1954 and which were only available for use in 1955.\nSection 23 of the Expropriation Act provides that upon the filing of the plan and description of the land which is required by s. 9 such lands become absolutely vested in the Crown and it is common ground that this was done on July 19, 1952. Section 24 of the Act, so far as it needs to be considered, reads:\n24. (1) Whenever, from time to time, or at any time before the compensation money has been actually paid, any parcel of land taken for a public work, or any portion of any such parcel, is found to be unnecessary for the purposes of such public work, or if it is found that a more limited estate or interest therein only is required, the Minister may, by writing under his hand, declare that the land or such portion thereof is not required and is abandoned by the Crown, or that it is intended to retain only such limited estate or interest as is mentioned in such writing.\n* * *\n(4) The fact of such abandonment or revesting shall be taken into account, in connection with all the other circumstances of the case, in estimating or assessing the amount to be paid to any person claiming compensation for the land taken.\nThe appellant's claim is for compensation and must be based entirely upon the provisions of the statute. It is not a claim for damages: Jones v. Stanstead Railway Company12; Gibb v. The King13. The Act in terms says no more than that the fact of the revesting shall be taken into account \"in connection with all the other circumstances of the case\" in determining what compensation is to be paid.\nWith great respect for the contrary opinion of the learned trial judge, I do not agree that the loss of possible profits amounting to $28,600, considered to have been suffered, may be allowed as a deduction from the value of the property at the date of the abandonment. If any such allowance may be made, it must be dealt with independently as a loss resulting from the expropriation. The value of the property when revested in the suppliant was not diminished by the fact that during the twenty-two month period profits which might have been made had not been realized. If the property had diminished in value during the period, the claim made under this head would be quite distinct from the claim for loss of profit.\nIn my opinion, in circumstances such as are disclosed by the evidence in this matter, the suppliant is entitled under s. 24(4) to be compensated for such loss as is shown to have been sustained by it which is attributable to the fact that it was deprived of title to the property for a period of 22 months. The appellant might have ceased its business and removed its furniture and other personal property from the premises in July 1952, in which event it would have been entitled to be paid, in the opinion of the learned trial judge, $540,743. However, of its own motion and with the apparent consent of the Crown, the suppliant remained in possession rent free and operated its business.\nI am unable to appreciate how it can be said that by following this course an added liability was imposed upon the Crown.\nThe allowance was made under head 2 of the suppliant's claim and the reasons for judgment described it \"a claim for prospective profit which the suppliant was prevented from realizing during the twenty-two months preceding the abandonment of the expropriation.\"\nThe appellant had filed a series of financial statements referring to its operations during the years 1947 to 1957, both inclusive, and it was upon the facts disclosed by these statements that the learned trial judge was invited to assess the loss of profit during the twenty-two month period in question. The judgment dealing with this aspect of the matter reads in part as follows:\nThe suppliant, by expending $175,000 during part of the years 1954-55, reaped a net profit of $45,000 in round figures on 1956 operations which dropped to $21,000 in 1957, or an average of $33,000 a year. There is no assurance, however, that, if the suppliant had been permitted to make the same expenditure during 1952, similar profits would have been realized. It is possible but not likely that a loss such as took place in 1950 would have re-occurred. In my opinion, however, it is more probable that the net profit would have exceeded the 1945-50 average by about ten per cent. Under the circumstances, including those considered later, I think that the suppliant, owing to the expropriation followed by revesting, was deprived of a profit of $1,300 a month or $28,600 which it otherwise would have realized during the intervening twenty-two months in question.\nThere are, in my opinion, upon the evidence in this case, insuperable objections to determining the amount of the alleged loss in this manner.\nThe fire which took place in August 1951, according to the witness J. P. Maloney, destroyed practically half of the hotel buildings and in respect of this loss the appellant was paid $237,390.47 by various insurance companies. In spite of the receipt of this large sum, the only expenditures made on the buildings up to the date of expropriation were some $30,000 for additions and repairs, which enabled the continuation of the business and the retention of the licence. According to the witness Noffke, he had received instructions shortly before the expropriation to prepare plans for a large addition to the buildings and these had been partially prepared on July 19, 1952, though the specifications were not prepared. The learned judge found as a fact in disposing of the claim for loss of revenue made under head 3 that the appellant had failed to establish that but for the expropriation proceedings he would have proceeded with this large addition to the buildings.\nThere is no evidence in this record which indicates that the building of the addition, plans for which were prepared in August 1954 and as to which the architect was only instructed after the notice of abandonment, would have been proceeded with but for the expropriation. Noffke, when asked on cross-examination whether this addition could not have been built during the period between May 1952 and May 1953, answered:\nOn account of conditions it was not possible because the money was not available.\nThe compensation awarded, however, proceeds on the basis that but for the expropriation the appellant would have had in operation the enlarged hotel which, as the evidence shows, was not ready for occupation until September 1955, throughout the period from July 19, 1952, to May 18, 1954. Noffke, whose plan for the addition undertaken in 1954 is dated August 3, 1954, said that it had taken him two or three months to complete the plans from the time they were ordered and that the shortest time required to complete the work would be one and a half years. Assuming that funds had been available in May 1953, the addition would not have been ready for operation until several months after the notice of abandonment was given. He confirmed the fact that there was no talk of constructing the lesser addition to the premises in 1952. In these circumstances, there appears to me to be no foundation for the allowance made, computed in this manner.\nApart from these considerations and with great respect, I do not think that the evidence supports the finding that, assuming the expenditure of $175,000 for the building had been completed on the date of the expropriation, the profits would have exceeded the amount actually realized by $1,300 a month, the figure used at arriving at the compensation of $28,600. The financial statements prepared by the company's auditors for the years 1947 to 1957 were put in evidence. These show that in the year 1950, before the fire, the profit from the operation was $4,660.06. In the following year the operations showed a loss of $44,914.73, this result, no doubt, being contributed to by the interruption of the operations caused by the fire. In 1952 the detailed auditors' statement shows a net loss of $8.44, an amount which was amended, however, to show a profit of $4,062, apparently after the accounts had been reviewed by the Income Tax Department. The statement does not appear to be an accurate statement of the result of the operations for that year for the following reasons:\u2014from July 19, 1952, this property was owned by the Crown and as such was exempt from municipal taxation, other than as regards water supply and light and the making and repairing of sidewalks, water courses and drains under the provisions of s. 409 of the charter of the City of Hull (Statutes of Quebec 1893, c. 52, as amended by s. 17 of c. 96 of the Statutes of 1925). No allowance is made in the statement for this fact, taxes being charged in the amount of $7,817.37 as an expense. In addition, an amount of $7,018.43 was charged for maintenance and repairs and $410 for insurance. Since the buildings were the property of the Crown, to the extent that the maintenance and repairs were made after July 19, 1952, the appellant was under no obligation and, to the extent that the charge for insurance referred to insurance on the buildings, the appellant had no insurable interest from that date. The proportion of these expenses attributable to the period after the date of expropriation was not a proper deduction from income and would increase the profit of $4,062 substantially.\nFor the year 1953 the inaccuracies are more substantial. Throughout the calendar year the lands and buildings were the property of the Crown: yet, as part of the expenses there were charged:\nInsurance................................................................... $ 531.\nMaintenance and repairs........................................... 3,046.\nTaxes......................................................................... 7,912.\nDepreciation of real estate......................................... 5,178.\nmaking a total of $16,667. The statement filed on behalf of the appellant showed an operating profit of $2,408 for this year but, adding the deductions mentioned, the operation showed a profit in the neighbourhood of $19,000. For the year 1954 a loss of $4,581 was shown. Until May 18, 1954, the title remained in the Crown: yet, charges for maintenance and repairs, taxes and depreciation of real estate totalling $14,235 were shown in the statement, a substantial part of which was not properly chargeable.\nThe learned trial judge was apparently invited to estimate the loss of profit on the footing that the figures submitted were accurate but, as I have indicated, there were grave inaccuracies.\nIn my opinion, if there was any loss of profits during the period of 22 months the appellant had no claim for compensation, since such loss was occasioned by its voluntary act in remaining in possession rent free during the period. If there was any legal basis for such a claim, I consider that the evidence does not support any award.\nI am further of the opinion that the sum of $3,500 allowed as the fees of the architect in preparing the plans for the large addition to the premises under head 5 should not have been awarded. The plans were in fact partially prepared but the learned trial judge has held that it was not shown that the building would have been proceeded with had the property not been expropriated. The appellant could have availed itself of the benefit of these plans after the notice of abandonment had it wished to do so, and suffered no loss attributable to the expropriation.\nUnder head 7 the appellant claimed to recover a sum of $7,000 which the witness Maloney said he had paid to the late Senator Beauregard for legal fees. No account was put in evidence and no further particulars given in regard to this expenditure. Senator Beauregard was not the solicitor on the record in the present action but appears to have been retained when the information was exhibited by the Attorney General on July 14, 1953. The matter was mentioned by counsel for the Crown at the commencement of the trial, saying that the information had been laid but that, before it had been proceeded with, the appellant had proceeded by way of petition of right and asked permission to withdraw the information without costs. Counsel for the present appellant objected to this, saying that the appellant claimed the amount paid to Senator Beauregard, and the learned judge directed that \"this expense will be attached to the petition of right.\" It was this claim that was referred to the registrar for taxation in the judgment appealed from, the learned judge saying:\nI think that the respondent should be required to pay taxable costs for services rendered by the late Senator Beauregard in respect of the information that was laid by the respondent and later withdrawn.\nThe appellant questions the right of the learned judge to direct the taxation of this account, saying that solicitor and client's costs are not subject to taxation in the courts of Quebec. This objection cannot be given effect to as the costs are payable in respect of the proceedings taken in the Exchequer Court, and those allowable against a party are such as are permitted under the Rules of that Court. While, in strictness, these costs should have been taxed in the action commenced by the Crown, it is clear that the parties agreed that they should form part of the cost of the present action and, accordingly, they may properly be taxed by the registrar. The judgment does not direct whether they are to be taxed upon a party and party or solicitor and client basis. As to this, following the decision in The Quebec, Jacques-Cartier Electric Company v. The King14, I would direct that these be taxed as between solicitor and client.\nThe judgment referred to the registrar the question as to the allowance to be made to the witness Noffke, provision for which is made in item 42 of the tariff of the Exchequer Court, which is a proper disposition of the matter, in my opinion.\nUpon conflicting evidence Kearney J. found the value of the area of 2,007 square feet taken to be $6,021, a finding with which I respectfully agree. The learned judge, however, added to this amount ten per cent for forcible dispossession, for which, in my opinion, there is no warrant in these circumstances.\nThe claim in respect of the right-of-way over the adjoining lot for which under head 9 $36,000 was claimed was allowed at the trial at the sum of $1,500 and, in my opinion, no ground has been shown upon which this finding should be interfered with. I would, accordingly, allow this appeal in part and reduce the amount of the award to the sum of $7,521 and, in addition, such amounts as are found properly payable by the registrar in respect of the claim for costs for the services of the late Senator Beauregard and for the witness fee payable to the witness Noffke.\nI would dismiss the appeal and allow the cross-appeal to the extent indicated and award to the Crown its costs of the proceedings in this court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs; motion to vary allowed in part with costs.\nSolicitors for the suppliant, appellant: Hyde & Ahern, Montreal.\nSolicitor for the respondent: P.

Oliver Co-Operative Growers Exchange, [1963] S.C.R. 7\nDate: 1962-11-14\nLabour Relations Board of The Province of British Columbia and British Columbia Interior Fruit and Vegetable Workers Union, Local 1572 Appellants;\nand\nOliver Co-Operative Growers Exchange Respondent.\n1962: October 9; 1962: November 14.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nTrade unions\u2014Locals of union reorganized to form one local of new union\u2014Variation of certificate of bargaining authority\u2014Jurisdiction of Labour Relations Board\u2014Labour Relations Act, 1954 (B.C.), c. 17, now R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 205, ss. 10, 12, 63, 65(2).\nA number of union locals representing fruit and vegetable packing employees and certified under the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 155, entered into collective agreements with an organization representing the employers. Later, the union unanimously resolved to merge with and become part of the appellant union, and the individual locals subsequently passed similar resolutions approving such merger and change of name. The appellant union applied to the Labour Relations Board for a change of the name on the certificate of bargaining authority from locals of the old union to that of the new union. Obviously, what was being done was both merger and a change of name. The judge of first instance held that the Board had power to do this under the Labour Relations Act, 1954 (B.C.), c. 17, now R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 205, but this decision was reversed by a majority of the Court of Appeal. The Board and the new union then appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\nPer Kerwin C.J. and Martland and Judson JJ.: The Board had jurisdiction to vary the certificate as it did under s. 65(2) of the Act. It was unnecessary to proceed under ss. 10 and 12 dealing with certification and decertification; the certification procedures of ss. 10 and 12 were appropriate when a union seeks initial certification or contending unions seek certification but not in the case of a successor union resulting from a merger or reorganization. Section 65(2) conferred upon the Board an entirely independent power to vary or revoke a former order in appropriate circumstances and this included power to deal with cases not specifically provided for by the Act and which were outside the ordinary operation of s. 10 and s. 12. In re Hotel and Restaurant Employees' International Union, Local 28 et al. (1954), 11 W.W.R. (N.S.) 11; R. v. Ontario Labour Relations Board, Ex parte Genaire Ltd., [1958] O.R. 637, affd. sub nom. International Association of Machinists v. Genaire Ltd. and Ontario Labour Relations Board (1959), 18 D.L.R. (2d) 588, referred to.\nThe proper record of the case consisted only of the petition of the appellant union and the decision of the Board; on the face of the record there was no error in either fact or law.\nThe suggestion that reg. 9(a), made under authority of s. 63, was an attempt by the Board to extend its jurisdiction beyond the Act was rejected.\nPer Cartwright and Ritchie JJ.: The Act made specific provision by s. 12(10) (a) for cancellation of certification at any time when the Board was satisfied that the certified union \"has ceased to be a trade union\". The respondent failed to show that the provisions of this section had not been complied with, and as the Board had ample ground for being satisfied that the old unions had ceased to exist, it was to be taken that it was so satisfied and that the requirements of the section were, therefore, fulfilled.\nUnder the circumstances of the case, the Board was acting within the scope of the authority conferred by s. 65(2) when it granted the order in question, and so varied the original order of certification as to recognize the new local as the bargaining representative of the unit. The provisions of s. 65(2) did not clothe the Board with authority to ignore specific provisions of the Act and to so vary its orders as to achieve by a \"short cut\" a result which under the Act could only be achieved by taking certain specified steps. However, when it was apparent that the Board's existing order no longer reflected the true situation and when the Board was satisfied that the order should be varied in order to give effect to the true purposes of the certification and was satisfied also that there were no provisions of the Act which specifically covered the situation, then the Board was justified in exercising the authority conferred on it by s. 65(2).\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], which, on an appeal from a judgment of Brown J. dismissing a motion for certiorari, quashed a decision of the Labour Relations Board. Appeal allowed.\nA. B. Macdonald, for the appellant Union.\nA. W. Mercer, for the appellant Board.\nJ. G. Alley, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Martland and Judson JJ. was delivered by\nJUDSON J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2],, which, on an appeal from Brown J., quashed a decision of the Labour Relations Board. The appeal is by the Labour Relations Board of the province and a union, which I shall refer to as Local 1572.\nBefore Local 1572 came into being the employees in the industry were represented by nine locals of the Fruit and Vegetable Workers' Union. These locals, which had been certified in 1952 under the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 155, included employees of 23 named employers operating 30 plants in the fruit and vegetable packing industry in the Okanagan Valley. The locals and the Okanagan Federated Shippers Association representing the employers had entered into collective agreements.\nLater, there was a jurisdictional dispute between the Fruit and Vegetable Workers' Union and the Teamsters' Union. This dispute came to an end in 1958, at the prompting of the Canadian Labour Congress which was to establish a new local to succeed to the rights and liabilities of the nine locals of the old union. On November 22, 1958, the Fruit and Vegetable Workers' Union, with due notice to its members, held a meeting and amended its constitution to permit merger or affiliation with the proposed new union, Local 1572. Local 1572 was actually chartered by the Canadian Labour Congress on November 28, 1958. The new local accepted as members the vast majority of the employees with the approval of the Fruit and Vegetable Workers' Union. On January 16 and 17, 1959, at a convention of the old union, it unanimously resolved to merge with and become part of the new union and to change its name accordingly. After January 17, 1959, the individual locals of the Fruit and Vegetable Workers' Union passed similar resolutions approving such merger and change of name.\nOn March 24, 1959, the appellant union applied to the Board for a change of the name appearing on the Certificate of Bargaining Authority, dated July 24, 1952, from locals of the old union to that of the new union. This application, made on the Board's usual form, states that the reason for the application is \"merger and change of name\". Regulation 9(a), made under the authority of s. 63 of the Labour Relations Act, 1954 (B.C.), c. 17, now R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 205, provides a procedure on applications to the Board under s. 65(2) of the Act where a trade union desires a change of name on a certificate due to merger or other circumstances. I emphasize at this point that no interested person could have understood that what was being done was a mere change of name. It was obviously both merger and a change of name.\nThe Board's order is dated May 25, 1959, and reads as follows:\nVARIATION OF CERTIFICATE\nWHEREAS by Certificate issued the 24th day of July, 1952, the Fruit and Vegetable Workers Unions, Locals Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 11, were certified for a unit employed by twenty-three employers in thirty packing-houses in the Okanagan Valley;\nAND WHEREAS it has been shown to this Board that each of the said unions has changed its name to B.C. Interior Fruit and Vegetable Workers Union, Local No. 1572;\nAND WHEREAS the Labour Relations Board is satisfied that the employees in the unit to which this Certificate relates desire the requested change in name of the certified trade unions;\nNow THEREFORE, pursuant to Section 65(2) of the Labour Relations Act, the said Certificate of the 24th day of July, 1952, is varied by deleting therefrom the names Fruit and Vegetable Workers Unions, Locals No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 11, and by inserting in their place and stead the name B.C. Interior Fruit and Vegetable Workers Union, Local No. 1572.\nThe order of the Board makes no express reference to merger but it does recite that it exercised its powers under s. 65(2) of the Labour Relations Act. By implication there is a reference to merger because the names of Locals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 11 are deleted and the name of Local 1572 is substituted.\nThe issue is whether the Board had power to do this under s. 65(2) of the Act, which reads:\n65. (2) The Board may, upon the petition of any employer, employers' organization, trade-union, or person, or of its own motion, reconsider any decision or order made by it under this Act, and may vary or revoke any such decision or order.\nThe majority in the Court of Appeal held that the Board's power under s. 65(2) and regulation 9(a) was limited to the substitution of a new name for an old and that the word \"vary\" in s. 65(2) could not support the substitution of another union for that set out in a Certificate of Bargaining Authority. That would amount to a new and different certification, a replacement of one union by another, a change that could only be brought about by following the procedure laid down by ss. 10 and 12. The decision is that Local 1572, being a new union, should have applied for certification and not variation of an existing certificate and that variation of a certificate in the circumstances of this case was beyond the powers of the Board. The learned judge of first instance and Davey J.A., in the Court of Appeal, were of a contrary opinion and held that the Board had jurisdiction under s. 65(2). I am of the opinion that this is the correct view to take of the Act.\nThere is no dispute that the procedure of the Board under s. 65(2) was correct. Every interested party had knowledge of what was being done and was given an opportunity to be heard. It is of some significance that out of 23 employers, only this particular respondent-employer opposed the application. That, of course, does not cure a defect if it is one of lack of jurisdiction.\nIt is equally beyond dispute that no attempt was made to proceed under ss. 10 and 12 of the Act dealing with certification and decertification. The gist of the decision of Davey J.A., with which I fully agree, is that it was unnecessary to proceed under ss. 10 and 12 and that the certification procedures of s. 10 and s. 12 of the Act were appropriate when a union seeks initial certification or contending unions seek certification but not to the case of a successor union resulting from a merger or reorganization. He held that s. 65(2) conferred upon the oBard an entirely independent power to vary or revoke a former order in appropriate circumstances and that this included power to deal with cases not specifically provided for by the Act and which were outside the ordinary operation of s. 10 and s. 12.\nThis recognition of a plenary independent power of the Board under s. 65(2) of the Act has the support of two prior decisions, that of Clyne J. on the British Columbia Act in In re Hotel and Restaurant Employees' International Union, Local 28 et al.[3], and that of McRuer C.J.H.C. and the Court of Appeal in Regina v. Ontario Labour Relations Board, Ex parte Genaire Ltd.[4], where the corresponding section of the Ontario Labour Relations Act was considered. It is, in my opinion, a very necessary power to enable the Board to do its work efficiently and the present case affords an illustration of the need for it. Employees in a certain industry, organized in nine locals, decide to combine in one local of a new union, which performs the same function as the fragmented union and presents a continuity of interest, property, management, representation and personnel.\nWhen met with an application by a successor union, what useful purpose could the Board serve by compelling decertification proceedings for the nine old locals and an application for certification of the new local 1572 when all this could be done on notice to the interested parties under s. 65(2)? The essential problem before the Board was one of representation of a group of employees and concepts concerning change of entity, derived from the law of companies, afford no assistance to its solution. Obviously Local 1572 was a new and different association of employees but it was a successor union.\nThe proper record of this case consists only of the petition of Local 1572 and the decision of the Board. Anything else is extraneous and inadmissible. There is no error in either fact or law on the face of the record. Much of the material in the appeal book was intended to show that certain employees of the respondent Oliver Co-Operative Growers Exchange did not like what had been done. There was no admissible evidence to show this but, even if there were, it does not supply a foundation for an application to quash by way of certiorari. This was a matter entirely for the Board's consideration within the exercise of its powers under s. 65(2).\nIt was also suggested that regulation 9(a) was an attempt by the Board to extend its jurisdiction beyond the Act. I do not so regard it. Section 65(2) gives the Board power to vary or revoke any decision or order. All that regulation 9(a) is saying is that the Board will consider the exercise of this power where \"due to merger or other circumstances\" a certified trade union changes its name from that which appears on the certificate. This is not an attempt to legislate by way of regulation in a manner not authorized by the Act.\nI would set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal, dismiss the application to quash the certificate or decision of the Board and restore the judgment on the hearing. The respondent in this Court, Oliver Co-Operative Growers Exchange, should pay to Local 1572 its costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court, and to the Labour Relations Board its costs in this Court.\nThe judgment of Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by\nRITCHIE J.:\u2014The circumstances giving rise to this appeal are stated by my brother Judson whose reasons for judgment I have had the benefit of reading and with whose disposition of this appeal I am in full agreement. I reach the same result by a slightly different process of reasoning and will accordingly state my reasons briefly.\nParagraph 5 of the petition, pursuant to which the order of May 25, 1959, was granted, reads as follows:\n5. Has the change of name of the trade union been approved by the membership affected?\nYes.\nIn what manner?\nThrough merger, and change of name by resolution, adopted at a meeting of Local Unions No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, and later at a convention of the F.F.V.W.U. Further, Locals No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, and their members were merged with Local No. 1572 by resolution adopted at a meeting of Local No. 1572 held on March 15, 16, 17, 1959.\nIt is apparent that in the view of all the unions and their members a merger had been completely effected by March 17, 1959, with the result that the old unions had ceased to exist and all their rights, jurisdiction, assets and liabilities had become vested in the new union, but the status of all these unions as bargaining representatives for their members is circumscribed by the provisions of the Labour Relations Act, and until the Labour Relations Board cancelled the certificate of Locals Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 11 in the manner provided by that Act they remained, for all purposes of the Act the bargaining representative of the employees in the unit concerned. The new union (Local 1572), on the other hand, could not achieve that status until the Board granted certification in its name.\nThe Labour Relations Act makes specific provision by s. 12(10) (a) for cancellation of certification at any time when the Labour Relations Board is satisfied that the certified union \"has ceased to be a trade union\". The respondent, who challenged the Board's jurisdiction, has failed to show that the provisions of this section were not complied with, and as I am of opinion that the Board had ample ground for being satisfied that the old unions had ceased to exist, I think it is to be taken that it was so satisfied and that the requirements of the section were, therefore, fulfilled. I do not think that the omission to refer to s. 12(10) (a) in the order of May 25, 1959, in any way detracts from the validity of the cancellation of certification of the old unions which that order effected.\nThe certification of Local 1572, which, in my view, was also effected by the last-mentioned order, stands on an entirely different footing because at the time when that order was granted the Labour Relations Act contained no provision specifically dealing with the certification of a new trade union with which a certified bargaining representative had merged and the validity of the order in this regard must, therefore, depend upon the scope of the authority accorded to the Board by s. 65(2) pursuant to which it was granted.\nI do not think that the provisions of s. 65(2) which are reproduced in the reasons of Judson J. clothe the Board with authority to ignore specific provisions of the Act and to so vary its orders as to achieve by a \"short cut\" a result which under the Act can only be achieved by taking certain specified steps. However, when it is apparent that the Board's existing order no longer reflects the true situation and when the Board is satisfied that that order should be varied in order to give effect to the true purposes of the certification and is satisfied also that there are no provisions of the Act which specifically cover the situation, then, in my opinion, the Board is justified in exercising the authority conferred on it by s. 65(2). It seems to me that the Board was faced with such a situation in the present case, and that it is to be taken as having been satisfied that the certified unions had ceased to exist and that the majority of the employees of each of the employers concerned were members of the new union. Under these circumstances, I am of opinion that the Board was acting within the scope of the authority conferred by s. 65(2) when it granted the order of May 25, 1959, and so varied the original order of certification as to recognize Local 1572 as the bargaining representative of the unit.\nIn all other respects, I am in agreement with the reasons of Mr. Justice Judson.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant Board: Paine, Edmonds, Mercer & Williams, Vancouver.\nSolicitor for the appellant Union: A.

Beder, [1963] S.C.R. 86\nDate: 1962-12-17\nKatherine Burkhardt, Administratrix of the Estate of the late Christian Burkhardt (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nHorst Klaus Beder (Defendant) Respondent.\n1962: November 29; 1962: December 17.\nPresent: Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright, Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nDamages\u2014Negligence\u2014Equal apportionment of liability\u2014Jury\u2019s assessment of damages greater than amount claimed in statement of claim\u2014Amount recoverable.\nB was killed instantly when struck by a motor-car driven by the defendant. The plaintiff, who was the widow of B and administratrix of his estate, brought an action for damages under The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 138. The statement of claim as originally delivered claimed general damages under the Act of $15,000 and $300 for funeral expenses. By an amendment made at the opening of the trial, in the absence of the jury, the claim for general damages was increased to $20,000. The jury found that B and the defendant had been equally negligent and assessed the plaintiff\u2019s total damages at $26,300. Judgment was entered for the plaintiff for $13,150.\nThree days later the trial judge informed counsel that when he endorsed the record he had overlooked the fact that the total claimed for general damages was $20,000 and expressed the opinion that he could not enter judgment for more than one-half that amount. The plaintiff\u2019s request for a further amendment was refused and judgment was directed to be entered for $10,150. On an appeal by the defendant and a cross-appeal by the plaintiff, the Court of Appeal gave judgment allowing the appeal, directing a new trial limited to the assessment of damages and dismissing the cross-appeal. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed, the order of the Court of Appeal set aside and the judgment at trial restored subject to variation.\nThe charge of the trial judge was adequate, and the sum fixed by the jury, although it may have been somewhat more than this Court would have awarded if it had been its responsibility to decide upon the amount, was not so inordinately high as to constitute a totally erroneous estimate of the plaintiff\u2019s loss.\nRule 147 of the Ontario Rules of Practice requires that when damages are claimed the amount shall be named in the statement of claim, and the authorities are clear that judgment cannot be given for an amount greater than that claimed unless an amendment is allowed. The limit of $20,000 placed upon the general damages claimed by the plaintiff in this action was a limit upon the amount recoverable by the judgment of the Court. It was immaterial by what steps the amount due the plaintiff in respect of her cause of action was ascertained and fixed. When so ascertained, judgment may be given thereon but not in excess of the limit fixed by the amount claimed in the prayer for relief. Accordingly, even if no amendment to the statement of claim had been granted the plaintiff would have been entitled to judgment for $13,000 general damages, this being less than the $15,000 originally claimed in the prayer for relief.\nGrant v. Hare, [1948] O.W.N. 653; Kong et al. v. Toronto Transportation Commission, [1942] O.R. 433, discussed; Parker v. Hughes, [1933] O.W.N. 508; Anderson v. Parney (1930), 66 O.L.R. 112, not followed.\nAPPEAL from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, setting aside a judgment of Aylen J. so far as that judgment related to the assessment of damages and directing a new trial restricted to the assessment of damages. Appeal allowed.\nL.F. Curran, for the plaintiff, appellant.\nR.E. Holland, Q.C., and G. Scheiffle, for the defendant, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nCARTWRIGHT J.:\u2014This is an appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario setting aside a judgment pronounced by Aylen J. after trial of the action with a jury so far as that judgment relates to the assessment of damages and directing a new trial restricted to the assessment of damages.\nThe action was brought by the appellant, who is the widow of the late Christian Burkhardt and the administratrix of his estate, for damages pursuant to the provisions of The Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 138.\nNone of the children of the late Christian Burkhardt were dependent on him and it is common ground that his widow alone is entitled to damages resulting from his death.\nChristian Burkhardt, while crossing O\u2019Connor Drive in Toronto on foot, was instantly killed when struck by a motor-car driven by the respondent.\nThe statement of claim as originally delivered claimed general damages under The Fatal Accidents Act of $15,000 and $300 for funeral expenses. By an amendment made at the opening of the trial, in the absence of the jury, the claim for general damages was increased to $20,000.\nThe questions put to the jury and their answers are as follows:\nQuestion No. 1: Has the Defendant Horst Klaus Beder satisfied you that he was not guilty of any negligence which caused or contributed to the accident?\nAnswer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d. Answer: No.\nQuestion No. 2:\nWas the late Christian Burkhardt guilty of any negligence which caused or contributed to the accident? Answer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d.\nAnswer: Yes.\nQuestion No. 3: If your answer to question No. 2 is \u201cyes\u201d, in what did such negligence consist?\nAnswer fully stating all acts of negligence;\n(1) Misjudge the speed of the car;\n(2) Subsequently failed to keep watch.\nQuestion No. 4: If your answer to question No. 1 is \u201cno\u201d and your answer to question No. 2 is \u201cyes\u201d and you find it practicable to apportion the negligence as between the late Christian Burkhardt and the defendant, in what degrees do you apportion the negligence of:\n(a) the defendant Horst Klaus Beder 50%;\n(b) the late Christian Burkhardt 50%\nTotal 100%\nRegardless of your answers to the foregoing questions and without any apportionment, at what amount do you assess the total damages of the plaintiff Katherine Burkhardt?\nSpecial damages........................\n$ 300.00\nGeneral damages.......................\n26,000.00\nTotal......................................\n26,300.00\nOn these answers Mr. Curran, counsel for the plaintiff, moved for judgment and the transcript continues as follows:\nHis LORDSHIP: That would mean judgment for the plaintiff for $13,150, is that right? In accordance with the verdict of the jury there will be judgment for the plaintiff for $13,150 and costs.\nMR. CURRAN: Thank you, my Lord.\nMR. HOLLAND: May it please Your Lordship, I wish to ask the judgment not be entered for this sum on the ground that the award, the total award of damages, is not supported in any way by the evidence.\nHis LORDSHIP: I don\u2019t agree with you at all. The motion will be denied.\nThe learned trial judge endorsed the record accordingly and discharged the jury.\nThree days later the learned trial judge recalled counsel; he informed them that when he endorsed the record he had overlooked the fact that the total claimed for general damages was $20,000 and expressed the opinion that he could not enter judgment for more than one\u2011half of that amount. Mr. Curran asked for a further amendment but after some discussion this was refused and judgment was directed to be entered for $10,150 and costs. The defendant appealed only as to the quantum of damages, on the grounds that the amount was excessive and that there had been misdirection and non-direction; he asked that the Court of Appeal re-assess the damages or direct a new trial limited to the assessment of damages.\nThe plaintiff cross-appealed against the finding of contributory negligence and against the refusal of the learned trial judge to grant the amendment which had been asked for after the jury had made their answers; she asked that judgment be entered for the full amount of the damages assessed by the jury, $26,300; alternatively she asked that if a new trial were ordered it should be at large.\nAt the conclusion of the argument the Court of Appeal gave judgment allowing the appeal, directing a new trial limited to the assessment of damages and dismissing the cross-appeal.\nThe Court of Appeal decided that \u201cthere was non-direction in the charge amounting to mis\u2011direction upon the question of damages\u201d.\nWith respect, I am of opinion that the charge of the learned trial judge was adequate. He made it clear to the jury that they could give nothing for the injury to the plaintiff\u2019s feelings and that the damages were to be limited to a sum commensurate with the pecuniary benefits which she might reasonably have expected from the continuance of her husband\u2019s life. He warned them against giving too great weight to the figures given by the actuary who had testified as to the present value of annuities based on the life expectancy of the plaintiff and on the joint expectancy of the plaintiff and her husband. He told them to give consideration to the vicissitudes of life and urged them to reach a figure reasonable and proper having regard to all the facts of the case.\nAt the time of his death the deceased was 65 years of age and the plaintiff 64. They had been married for 38 years. The deceased was in good health. His earnings were $68 a week plus a Christmas bonus of $100. He had been steadily employed for 33 years with a long\u2011established firm. He was a skilled and conscientious worker and the uncontradicted evidence of his employers was that \u201che had a job with us for as long as he wished to stay\u201d and that they were having great difficulty in finding anyone to replace him. The sum fixed by the jury may be somewhat more than this Court would have awarded if it had been our responsibility to decide upon the amount; but I am unable to say that it was so inordinately high as to constitute a totally erroneous estimate of the plaintiff\u2019s loss. In my opinion, the Court of Appeal erred in setting aside the assessment made by the jury.\nAt the conclusion of Mr. Curran\u2019s argument urging that the jury\u2019s findings as to contributory negligence should be set aside we were all of the opinion that there was evidence to support those findings and Mr. Holland was not called upon to deal with this point.\nI do not find it necessary to deal with the arguments addressed to us by both counsel on the question whether the learned trial judge or the Court of Appeal should have allowed the amendment to the statement of claim which was refused as I have reached the conclusion that on the pleadings as they stood, without amendment, the plaintiff was entitled to judgment for $13,150.\nIn deciding that unless he granted the amendment he could not enter judgment for more than 50 per cent of the amount claimed, it would seem that Aylen J. regarded himself as bound by the decision of McRuer C.J.H.C. in Grant v. Hare[1].\nThat case was an action for damages for negligence tried with a jury. The plaintiff claimed $5,000. The jury apportioned 70 per cent of the blame to the plaintiff and 30 per cent to the defendant and assessed the plaintiff\u2019s total damages at $9,000. Counsel for the plaintiff asked leave to amend the statement of claim by increasing the claim to $9,000. This amendment was refused. Alternatively counsel for the plaintiff argued that judgment should be entered for $2,700 on the pleading as it stood since that amount was less than the sum claimed in the statement of claim. McRuer C.J. held that judgment should be entered for only $1,500. In so holding he purported to follow the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Kong et al. v. Toronto Transportation Commission[2].\nIn Kong\u2019s case, the plaintiff claimed, inter alia, $1,500 damages under The Fatal Accidents Act for the death of his son who was nine years old. The jury attributed 86 per cent of the blame to the defendant and assessed the damages at $3,500. The trial judge endorsed the record directing judgment to be entered for $3,010. Some three weeks later the plaintiff moved for leave to amend the prayer for relief by increasing the amount claimed under this head to $3,010. The trial judge granted the amendment. On appeal the Court of Appeal reversed the order granting the amendment and directed that judgment be entered for $1,500, although had the principle acted upon in Grant v. Hare been applied the judgment would have been for only $1,290. This can scarcely have been done through inadvertence for in argument (as appears at p. 434 of the report) counsel for the defendant had submitted that \u201cthe plaintiff was entitled only to 86 per cent of the amount claimed\u201d and had cited Parker v. Hughes[3].\nThe judgment in Parker v. Hughes is founded on that in Anderson v. Parney[4]. It may be that both of these cases are distinguishable from the case at bar as the judgments turn to some extent on the wording of The Division Courts Act, R.S.O. 1927, c. 95. If, however, they are not distinguishable I would decline to follow them as they were not applied by the Court of Appeal in Kong\u2019s case and as I prefer the reasoning of Orde J.A. in his dissenting judgment to that of the majority in Anderson v. Parney. In particular I wish to adopt the following passage from the reasons of Orde J.A. at pp. 120 and 121:\nThe limit of $120 placed upon the Division Court jurisdiction in personal actions is a limit upon the amount recoverable by the judgment of that court. It is immaterial by what steps the amount due the plaintiff in respect of a single cause of action is ascertained and fixed. When so ascertained, judgment may be given thereon, but not in excess of the court\u2019s limited jurisdiction.\nRule 147 of the Ontario Rules of Practice requires that when damages are claimed the amount shall be named in the statement of claim, and the authorities are clear that judgment cannot be given for an amount greater than that claimed unless an amendment is allowed.\nAdapting the words of Orde J.A. to the circumstances of the case at bar I would say: \u201cThe limit of $20,000 placed upon the general damages claimed by the plaintiff in this action is a limit upon the amount recoverable by the judgment of the Court. It is immaterial by what steps the amount due the plaintiff in respect of her cause of action is ascertained and fixed. When so ascertained, judgment may be given thereon but not in excess of the limit fixed by the amount claimed in the prayer for relief\u201d.\nIt may be observed that in Parker v. Hughes the Court was composed of Latchford C.J. and Riddell and Jasten JJ.A. While all three held that they were bound by Anderson v. Parney both Riddell J.A. and Masten J.A. appear to have regretted that this was so.\nIt follows from what I have said above that, in my opinion, even if no amendment to the statement of claim had been granted the plaintiff would have been entitled to judgment for $13,000 general damages, this being less than the $15,000 originally claimed in the prayer for relief. No question arises as to the claim for funeral expenses.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal and direct that the formal judgment of the learned trial judge be varied by striking out paragraph 1 thereof and substituting the following:\nThis Court doth order and adjudge that the plaintiff do recover from the defendant the sum of Thirteen thousand, one hundred and fifty dollars ($13,150).\nand that subject to this variation the judgment at the trial be restored.\nThe appellant is entitled to her costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal and of the appeal to this Court. There should be no order as to the costs of the cross-appeal to the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed, order of Court of Appeal set aside and judgment at trial restored subject to variation.\nSolicitors for the plaintiff, appellant: Wright & McTaggart, Toronto.\nSolicitors for the defendant, respondent: Bassel, Sullivan, Holland & Hardisty, Toronto.\n[1] [1948] O.W.N. 653.\n[2] [1942] O.R. 433.\n[3] [1933] O.W.N. 508.\n[4] (1930), 66 O.L.R. 112.\n",

During the lifetime of the agreement the plaintiff had accumulated a considerable number of sub-agents who were in possession of \"expirations\" relative to the fire insurance written by them. After the termination of the contract the defendant insurance company invited a number of the plaintiff's sub-agents to place their renewal fire insurance business with it on a direct basis, thus obtaining the advantage of the \"expirations\" in respect of the renewal of any fire insurance policy placed by these sub-agents for the plaintiff. The trial judge awarded damages for breach of contract. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. The defendant insurance company appealed to this Court.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\nOn the facts of this case the defendant insurance company had violated the terms of clause 9 of the agreement. In dealing, as it did, with the plaintiff's sub-agents the defendant obtained for its own use in effecting renewals of fire insurance the benefit of \"expirations\", the \"use and control\" of which it had agreed should be \"deemed to be the property\" of the plaintiff and \"left in his undisputed possession\". There were no reasons to disturb the amount of the award.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, affirming a judgment of Smith J. Appeal dismissed.\nAntoine Geoffrion, Q.C., for the defendant, appellant.\nCharles Holdstock, for the plaintiff, respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nRitchie J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench of the Province of Quebec1 dismissing an appeal from the judgment of Smith J. of the Superior Court of the City of Montreal which awarded to the respondent damages in the sum of $8,000 as compensation for loss caused by the appellant's violation of para. 9 of a certain agency agreement dated November 19, 1937, whereunder the respondent and its predecessor had operated as a \"general agent\" for the appellant in the fire insurance business in the Province of Quebec for seven years prior to the termination of the agreement by the appellant in July 1944. The sole issue in this appeal is whether, after termination, the appellant violated the provisions of the said para. 9 by entering into \"direct agency\" agreements with certain of the respondent's former sub-agents and thereby turning to its own account some of the \"good will\" accumulated by the respondent in its capacity as the appellant's general agent.\nParagraph 9 of the agency agreement reads as follows:\n9. In the event of termination of this Agreement, the Agent not being in default and thereafter promptly accounting for and paying over balances not in default for which he is liable, the Agent's records, use and control of expirations shall be deemed the property of the Agent and left in his undisputed possession; otherwise the records, use and control of expirations shall be vested in the Company.\nThe word \"expirations\" as used in this context has a meaning peculiar to the insurance business which is well defined in the decision of the United States Federal Court of Appeals in V. L. Phillips & Company v. Pennsylvania Threshermen & Farmers' Mutual Casualty Insurance Company2:\n(1) \"Expirations\" in the insurance field has a definite and well recognized meaning; it embodies the records of an insurance agency by which the agent has available a copy of the policy issued to the insured or records containing the date of the insurance policy, the name of the insured, the date of its expiration, the amount of insurance, premiums, property covered and terms of insurance. This information enables the agent to contact the insured before the existing contract expires and arms him with the information essential to secure another policy and to present to the insured a solution for his insurance requirements. It has been determined that this information is of vital assistance to the agency in carrying on the insurance business and it has become, in the insurance field, recognized as a valuable asset in the nature of good will.\nDuring the lifetime of the agreement the respondent had accumulated a very considerable number of sub-agents who were in possession of \"expirations\" relative to the fire insurance written by them. During the same period the appellant had been operating a branch office in the Province of Quebec for the writing of casualty insurance business, and for this purpose it had acquired a number of agents, some of whom were also sub-agents for the respondent in the fire insurance business.\nOn December 4, 1944, the appellant circularized such of its casualty insurance agents as had not been sub-agents of the respondent before entering the casualty field, inviting them to enter into \"direct agency\" agreements for the sale of fire insurance, and in so doing it was, in effect, inviting a number of the respondent's sub-agents to place their renewal fire insurance business with it on a \"direct\" basis. It is not difficult to see that by making the respondent's sub-agents its own direct agents it would obtain the advantage of the expirations in respect of the renewal of any fire insurance policy placed by such sub-agent for the respondent.\nThe essential facts are really not in dispute and the elaborate arguments made on behalf of the appellant to justify the course followed by it in this case have been reviewed by the Court of Queen's Bench and were, in my view, very fully and properly dealt with in the exhaustive decision of the learned trial judge who concluded that:\nWhile it may be true that the records of the sub-agents relating to insurance written by them, were their own property as between themselves and the plaintiff; the defendant's contract with the plaintiff made such records the exclusive property of the plaintiff and subject to its absolute control, and the defendant had no right to make use of said expirations by the simple expedient of constituting the former sub-agents its own agents and then accepting through them renewals of insurance formerly written by the said sub-agents for the account of the plaintiff.\nI do not think that the reasons for judgment of the Courts below are to be construed as deciding that the good will of a general agent becomes his absolute property free from all future competition from the insurance company on the termination of an agreement such as the present one nor do I think, as was suggested by counsel for the appellant, that these judgments have the effect of transforming para. 9 into a covenant in restraint of trade. This case should not, in my view, be construed as going further than deciding that the action here taken by the insurance company constituted a breach of the paragraph in question.\nIt is neither necessary nor desirable to lay down any rules of general application regulating the conduct of insurance companies in competing for business originally written by a general agent whose contract has been terminated. Each case must, of course, depend on the terms of the agency agreement in question and the acts of the parties in relation thereto. It is sufficient for the purposes of this case to say that in dealing, as it did, with the respondent's sub-agents the appellant obtained for its own use in effecting renewals of fire insurance the benefit of \"expirations\", the \"use and control\" of which it had agreed should be \"deemed to be the property\" of the respondent and \"left in his undisputed possession\". In so doing, the appellant violated the terms of its agreement.\nThe learned trial judge fixed the damages at $8,000 and, like the judges of the Court of Queen's Bench, I can see no reason for disturbing this award.\nFor these reasons, as well as those stated by the learned trial judge, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nAttorneys for the defendant, appellant: Geoffrion & Prud'homme, Montreal.\nAttorney for the plaintiff, respondent: C. Holdstock, Montreal.\n1 [1961] Que. Q.B. 476.\n2 (1952), 199 F. (2d) 244 at 246.\n",
