(Shaw v. St. Louis, 8 Can. S.C.R. 387 distinguished).\n2. The Supreme Court has no jurisdiction under sec. 29 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, upon an appeal by the defendant where the amount in controversy has not been established by the judgment appealed from. (Gwynne J. reserving his opinion on this point).\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) quashing an appeal to that court from the judgment of the Court of Review, by which the appellants' demurrer to respondent's action for damages was dismissed and the case was referred back to the Superior Court to ascertain the amount of damages.\nThe appellant in this case first applied to a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench for an order to settle the case and give the proper security. This application was refused, and thereupon the appellant made another application to Mr. Justice Strong in chambers for an order allowing security to be given on his appeal in accordance with the provisions of section 46 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\nUpon this application and after having heard the parties the following judgment was delivered:\u2014\nSTRONG J.\u2014This application is made by the Ontario and Quebec Railway Co. who were the appellants in an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench and the defendants in the court of first instance, to allow them to pay $500 into court as security for costs and for the due prosecution of the appeal pursuant to the 46th section of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act. The judgment of the Superior Court was in favor of the plaintiff, but it directed a reference to ascertain the amounts of damages which the plaintiff had sustained. By his action the plaintiff claimed damages to the amount of $5,000. The Court of Queen's Bench held that this was not a final, but a mere interlocutory judgment, and, therefore, not appealable without special leave, which had not been obtained.\nAlthough I have determined to grant the application, I have great doubts as to the competence of the Supreme Court to entertain the appeal, and my object in making the order asked for is to give the parties an opportunity of having the question of jurisdiction decided by the full court. As the delay for appealing prescribed by the Statute, and which I have no power to enlarge will elapse before the sitting of the court, this can only be done by allowing the security to be put in now, for otherwise, the appellant will be foreclosed by lapse of time before the court sits. I therefore, make the order asked for allowing the deposit of $500 in court as security pursuant to section 46 of the statute and I would suggest to the Parties that they should bring the case before the court as soon as possible and before incurring any expense in printing the record or factums. I may add that my doubt upon the point of jurisdiction is founded on the 29th section of the statute It appears to me that at present it cannot he said that the matter in controversy in this action for damages amounts to the sum or value of $2,000 and it is not pretended that a question coming within any of the several categories specified in the subjections to section 29 is involved in the appeal Before the rule laid down in Joyce v. hart ([1]) was displaced (as I consider it has been) by Allan v. Pratt ([2]) it would according to the former authority have been sufficient to give jurisdiction that the damages claimed in the conclusions of the action amounted to $2000. The decision of the Privy Council in the case last referred to however establishes that in an appeal by a defendant, the amount of the damages in which the appellant has been condemned affords the test to be applied in ascertaining the question of competence. The enactment under which Allan v Pratt (2) arose being identical with that of section 29 of the Supreme Court Act it appears to me that the same interpretation must be applied to the last mentioned section also. It may be remarked here that this 29th clause differs entirely in its wording from section 2311 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec which is an express enactment that the competence of a case for appeal whenever that depends on the amount in dispute is to be ascertained from the amount demanded and not from that recovered by the judgment if they are different. Without at present expressing any decided opinion I am inclined to think that it is a proper inference to be drawn from the case of Allan v. Pratt (2) that when a defendant in an action for damages or other money demand seeks to appeal to the Supreme Court he must be able to show from the judgment that the amount in controversy is not less than $2000, in other words he must establish that a judgment to that amount at least has been rendered against him and as at present advised, it appears to me not to he sufficient to say, that although no amount has been actually ascertained by the judgment rendered, yet the proceeding ordered by that judgment may result in he condemnation of the defendant in damages to the amount of $2,000 It was also contended by Mr. Abbott on behalf of the appellant that if he proceeded to execute the judgment by taking part in the reference ordained by it, he would be precluded by acquiescence from objecting to it hereafter in case he should appeal from the final judgment, even though the damages when ascertained should amount to $2,000 or upwards and that thus on an appeal from the final judgment he would be restricted to the question of damages and altogether debarred from impugning the principle of the present judgment establishing the defendants liability in the action. And for this position Shaw v. St. Louis ([3]) was cited as an authority. As the judgment sought to be appealed against has been held by the Court of Appeals to be interlocutory and not final, this objection does not at present appear to me to be conclusive, and I should probably so hold if I now undertook to decide the point which, however, I expressly refrain from doing.\nAs both the points taken are worthy of consideration I think it better instead of taking it upon myself sitting alone in chambers to decide such important questions of jurisdiction relating to appeals from the province of Quebec, to give the parties an opportunity of obtaining the opinion of the court, and, therefore, for that reason and for that reason alone I allow the proposed security to be given.\nArchambault Q.C. moved to quash the appeal on two grounds: 1. That the judgment appealed from was not a final judgment; 2. That it does not appear by the judgment appealed from that the matter in controversy amounts to $2000.\nH. Abbott I C. contra.\nSir W. J RITCHIE C J concurred with Taschereau J.\nSTRONG J. I am of opinion that this motion to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction ought to be granted.\nThe appellants do not bring themselves within the 29th section of the Supreme Court Act inasmuch as they do not establish that the matter in controversy amounts to $2,000.\nMy reasons for this conclusion are the same as those intimated in the note of my judgment in chambers, to which it is sufficient to refer without repeating them here.\nIt also appears to me that the judgment appealed from is not a final judgment. The learned judges of the Court of Queen's Bench have so held and their decision upon a question of procedure, such as this undoubtedly is, would be conclusive to me, even if my own individual opinion was different which however it is not. It is true that according to French procedure a judgment referring the estimation of damages to experts appears to be considered a definitive and not a mere preparatory or interlocutory judgment, but there are doubtless good reasons why the practice in the province of Quebec should be held otherwise as it always has been\nThe supposed difficulty founded on the decision in Shaw v. St. Louis ([4]) and which if well founded, would virtually deprive suitors of an appeal to this court in all cases where a preliminary judgment of reference, like that in the present case, might be pronounced seems to me chimerical and not to follow from that decision. It is sufficient for me to say that it is entirely disposed of by the reasons given in the judgment of my brother Taschereau, in which I concur.\nTASCHEREAU J. This case is before us on a motion to quash the appeal. The respondent's action is one in damages for $5,000 for bodily injuries by him suffered, as he alleges, by the negligence of the company appellant. The Superior Court dismissed the action, but the Court of Review reversed that judgment admitting the respondent's right of action, but referred the case back to the Superior Court to ascertain the amount of damages.\nFrom this judgment of the Court of Review the company appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench, but that court on motion by the respondent, before any other proceeding on the appeal, quashed the writ of appeal on the ground that it had been issued de piano and not with the permission of the court, as required by Art 1116 of the Code of Procedure.\nThe appeal here is from this judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench on that motion. The respondent moves to quash the appeal on two distinct grounds upon which the parties were heard:\n1st. That the judgment appealed from is not a final judgment.\n2nd That the matter in controversy does not amount to $2,000. I think both of these grounds well founded. The judgment of the Queen's Bench is purely and simply on a question of procedure, which finally determines nothing but that the writ of appeal as issued was illegal and voidable. It does certainly put an end to that writ, but that is not sufficient to bring it within the interpretation of the words \"final judgment\" in sec. 28 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act. If the Court of Queen's Bench had dismissed the respondent's motion instead of granting it the respondent could have appealed to this court, yet the judgment would not have put an end to his motion. To give to the words \"final judgment \" in the Supreme Court Act the wide interpretation contended for at the argument by the appellant here in answer to the respondent's motion, would be to render appealable all judgments of the Court of Queen's Bench by which a motion or any proceeding in that court would be dismissed or finally disposed of. We cannot give that construction to these words. The judgment quashing the writ of appeal, on an interlocutory proceeding, though final as to that appeal is an interlocutory judgment in the cause. The appellant argued, referring to Shaw v. St. Louis ([5]), that he might eventually find himself precluded from appealing to the court. Whether that is so or not a point which of course we have not to determine here, that will be simply because the statute does not provide for an appeal in such a case. In that case of Shaw v. St. Louis (1), speaking for the court, I cautiously refrained from expressing any opinion on the point whether Shaw, in that case, could have appealed to this court from the judgment of 1880; and Mr. Justice Fournier, I am sure, though he expressed an opinion on it, did not intend to give a decision not necessary for the determination of that case.\nThe appellant's attempt to establish by the decision of this court in that case of Shaw v. St. Louis (1) that the judgment of the Court of Review in the present case was not an interlocutory but a final judgment cannot succeed. There is no analogy whatever between the two cases. The gist of our decision there was that a judgment of a court of appeal, pass\u00e9 en force de chose juge \u201d, which is partly interlocutory and partly final, binds the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal itself, if the case comes up a second time, as to all of it that finally determined the issues between the parties or any of these issues, and we held the judgment in that case to have been partly a final judgment, though the case was referred to ascertain the amount the plaintiff was entitled to, but only in the sense that the maxim \"l'interlocutoire ne lie pas le juge \" did not apply to such a judgment. Here, we are asked to determine that the judgment of the Court of Review, certainly interlocutory for part, is not interlocutory in the sense given to this word in Art. 1116 of the Code of Procedure, a totally different question. Now we could not do so without unsettling a constant and long established jurisprudence in the province, a conclusion we could not come to, in any case, but with great hesitation and particularly so where on a question of practice and procedure, as we have often said, as a general rule we cannot interfere. This Art. 1116 C. C. P., moreover, as I read it, to express my own opinion on it, must apply to others than mere judgements pr\u00e9paratoires ou d'instruction, as it extends in express words to cases where the judgment in part decides the issue, or orders the doing of anything which cannot be remedied by the final judgment. In Shaw v. St. Louis ([6]) in express terms, referring to the case of Wardle v. Bethune ([7]) I refrained from expressing any opinion on the question as to what class of judgments Art. 1116 of the Code of Procedure applied. The second ground against the appeal is also well taken. It is now a settled point that upon an appeal to this court by the defendant the amount awarded by the judgment appealed from, and not the amount demanded by the declaration is to be considered as the matter in controversy under sec. 29 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, where the jurisdiction of the court depends upon the amount. Now, here the defendants, appellants, have not yet been condemned to any sum or amount whatever. How can it be said that the matter in controversy now amounts to $2,000? The plaintiff's demand, so far as the amount goes, is in abeyance. The defendants, appellants, may eventually be condemned to $500 or $1,000 only. This court has no jurisdiction in a case of the kind, where the amount in controversy, upon an appeal by the defendant, is not yet established.\nTo refer again to Shaw v. St. Louis ([8]) it must he remembered that at that time the jurisprudence of the court was that the amount demanded was the amount in controversy on the appeal to this court.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I rest my judgment simply upon the point that the Court of Appeal in the province of Quebec, from whose judgment the present appeal is taken in substance and effect merely quashed the appeal de piano as an irregular procedure according to the practice of the court of the province of Quebec, and did not render any judgment either approving or disapproving the judgment of the Court of Revision upon the point raised and argued before it. I desire to re\" serve my opinion upon the question raised as to there not being in the present case the sum of $2,000 in controversy so as to warrant an appeal to this court, until a case arises which must necessarily be tested and determined upon that question. Where judgment has been rendered in favor of a plaintiff for a sum awarded by a judge or jury, the amount so awarded is the amount in controversy regulating the right of appeal to this court but where a plaintiff brings an action claiming in his statement of claim, say $5,000 or any sum exceeding $2,000, and a final judgment on the merits is rendered for the defendant in the Superior Court of the province of Quebec, which judgment is reversed by the Court of Revision whose judgment is sustained by the Court of Appeal in that province upon an appeal duly instituted, then in such a case the defendant's right of appeal against the judgment reversing the final judgment in his favor must, in my opinion, (as at present advised) be regulated, so far as the amount in controversy is concerned by the amount claimed in the statement of claim,\u2014the plaintiff insisting on his right to recover that amount, and the defendant denying any such right,\u2014otherwise the result, in my judgment as at present advised, would be absurd, namely, that a defendant has no right of appeal to this court in a case where he is not liable to any judgment being rendered against him; but here the Court of Appeal in the province of Quebec reverses a final judgment in his favor upon the merits, and erroneously remits the case to be tried over again, or to have damages assessed against him in the Superior Court. The case of Allan v. Pratt ([9]) in the Privy Council is in my opinion, no authority for any such conclusion.\nPATTERSON J.

Ritchie c.j., and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE JUDGMENT OF MR. JUSTICE FALCONBRIDGE, SITTING FOR THE TRIAL OF THE HALDIMAND CONTROVERTED ELECTION.\nControverted election\u2014Bribery by agent\u2014Proof of agency\u2014Proof by conduct.\nAn election petition charged that H., an agent of the candidate whose election was attacked, corruptly offered and paid $5 to induce a voter to refrain from voting. The evidence showed that H. was in the habit of assisting this particular voter, and that being told by the voter that he contemplated going away from home on a visit a few days before the election, and being away on election day, H. promised him $5 towards paying his expenses. Shortly after the voter went to the house of H. to borrow a coat for his journey, and H's. brother gave him $5. He went away and was absent on election day.\nHeld, that the offer and payment of the $5 formed one transaction and constituted a corrupt practice under the Election Act.\nAt the election in question there was no formal organization of the party supporting the appellant. The County Reform Association had been disbanded and the minutes, regularly kept since 1882, destroyed, as were the rough minutes of every meeting of a convention of the party held since that date. In lieu of local committees vice-presidents were appointed for the respective townships, and on the approach of a contest the vice-presidents called a meeting of the county association, composed of all reformers in the riding, to go over the lists and do all the necessary work of the election.\nThe evidence of H's. agency relied on by the petitioner was, that he had always been a reformer, had been active for two elections, had attended one important committee meeting and been recognized by the vice-president of his township as an active supporter of the appellant, and that he acted as scrutineer at the polls in the election in question. The trial judge held that all these elements combined, in view of the state of affairs regarding organization, were sufficient to constitute H. an agent of the appellant. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada\u2014\nHeld, Ritchie C. J. dissenting, and Taschereau J. hesitating, that the circumstances proved justified the trial judge in holding the agency of H. established.\nAppeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Falcon-bridge on the trial of an election petition against the return of the appellant as a member of the House of Commons on an election in the County of Haldimand, whereby the appellant was unseated for bribery by an agent.\nThe election in question was held on Jan. 30th, 1889, and resulted in the return of the appellant. A petition was filed against such return which was tried before Mr. Justice Falconbridge in Sept., 1889, with the result that the appellant was unseated for bribery committed by one Haslett, his agent. He appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada from such decision.\nThe appeal was limited to two charges of bribery, numbered 8 and 82 in the petition. It is only necessary to refer to No. 82, which was follows:\n\"That on or about the day of the election in question, at the Township of Walpole, James Haslett, of Walpole, an agent of the respondent, offered and promised to pay and did pay to Henry Bridges, of the same place, a voter in the said electoral district, the sum of $5 to induce him, the said Bridges, to refrain from voting in the election at question or to vote thereat for the said respondent.\"\nThe respondent filed a cross-appeal submitting the other charges in the petition which were not passed upon by the trial judge as grounds for retaining the judgment appealed from. The following were the circumstances of the act of bribery charged in the petition as above set out: The voter, Bridges, was a conservative and a neighbor of the alleged briber Haslett who was in the habit of assisting him occasionally with loans and gifts of money and in other ways. A few days before the election he was at Haslett's house, having gone there to borrow a flail, and in conversation with Haslett told him that he contemplated going to Petrolia on a visit for two or three weeks. Haslett then said that if $5 would be of use to him he could have it. In giving evidence at the trial, Bridges swore that he demurred to taking the money as it might make trouble about the election. This Haslett denied. Shortly after this Bridges again went to Haslett's house to borrow a coat for his journey to Petrolia and while there a younger brother of Haslett gave him $5. He went to Petrolia and was away on polling day. The trial judge found that this payment to Bridges was a corrupt act on the part of Haslett.\nTo show that Haslett was an agent of the reform candidate at this election the petitioner produced evidence of his having been active on behalf of the same candidate at a former election in Haldimand; of his having attended a committee meeting during the election in question in this case and gone over the list of voters; and of his acting as scrutineer at this present election. It was also shown that there was no organization of the reform party in connection with this contest but that the candidate had addressed a mass meeting of the electors and stated that he wished them all to do their best to secure his return This, it was contended, made every reformer in the riding an agent under the act.\nThe evidence relating to the conduct of Haslett as given by himself at the trial is as follows: Q. Your politics, I believe, are pretty well pronounced, are they not? A. I do not know as they are.\nQ. Have you any doubt about your own politics? A. Oh, I have no doubt about it.\nQ. Well, why do you cast doubt upon it? A. Well, I never took any very active part in politics.\nQ. But which side are you on? A. I am a Reformer.\nQ. Always been on the Reform side? A. Yes.\nQ.

You contrast these last two with the former elections. What have you been doing at these last two elections more than you did at the former elections? A. I do not know that I did anything particularly, any more than go out to vote.\nQ. But didn't you go out to vote at the former elections? A. Yes.\nQ. Well, you did take au active part in the last two elections? A. Very little.\nQ. What do you mean by taking an active part? A. Going out and getting in voters.\nQ. You then went into the meeting? A. Yes.\nQ. And were there how long? A. Perhaps an hour or so.\nQ. While the talking was going on about the list? A. Yes.\nQ. Did you take any part in it? A. Nothing more than looking at the list and seeing who were the outside men.\nQ. Discussing whether they would come and so on? A. Yes.\nQ. Did you do any of that? A. No.\nQ. Well, what did you do these last two elections? A. Well, this last election I was the agent for Mr. Colter.\nHe explains in his cross-examination that this was as an agent appointed to attend as a scrutineer at the poll, and again he says: \"I am not positive who asked me to act.\"\nQ. Were you appointed at a meeting? A. No, I was not.\nQ. Well, if you were not appointed at a meeting you can tell me who asked you to act? A. Well, I think maybe it was Mr. Noble.\nQ. And who was Mr. Noble? A. A tailor.\nQ. Mr. Noble is the tailor of Jarvis? A. One of the tailors.\nQ. What part does Mr. Noble take in politics? A. Well, he was not in our polling division this last election.\nQ. James Noble, do you mean? A. Yes. Q. He is the vice-president, is he? A. Well, I think he is for the township.\nQ. Who is the chairman for the polling division? A. I do not know if there is one.\nQ. You have been showing some interest in this election? A. Well, I do not know as I took any great interest in it.\nQ. Did you canvass any person? A. I did not.\nQ. Did you attend any political meetings? A. Yes, I attended political meetings in Jarvis.\nQ. How many? A. I was at Mr. Colter's and at Dr. Montague's.\nQ. Anybody else's? A. No, that is all there were.\nQ. Did you attend any private meetings? A. No.\nQ. You know what a committee meeting is, do you? A. Yes.\nQ. Were you ever at a committee meeting? A. I have been at them.\nQ. Where? A. In Jarvis.\nQ. And when? A. Well, there was a committee meeting before the election.\nQ. Where was that held? A. I think it was held in the hotel.\nQ. Whose hotel? A. Hanrahan's.\nQ. And you attended that? A. Yes.\nQ. Did you attend only one meeting? A. I think that is all.\nQ. How long was that before the election? A. Probably a couple of weeks.\nQ. Who gave you notice to attend that meeting? A. Well, there was nobody gave notice.\nQ. How did you know about it? A. Well, we just met one another on the street.\nQ. Who was it told you? A. I could not say.\nQ. Was it a day meeting or a night meeting? A. Night.\nQ. What was done at that meeting? A. Just to look up the outside vote, and see about getting it in.\nQ. What else? What about the doubtful vote at home? A. There was nothing particular done about that.\nQ. You went over the voters' list, I suppose? A. Yes.\nQ. And were doubtful men assigned to different parties to be seen after? A. No.\nQ. For what purpose then, did you go over the list? A. Just to kind of see, to have an idea, how many men were outside the county.\nQ. That was the particular business? A. Yes.\nQ. And how long did the meeting last? A. Perhaps an hour.\nQ. And who was the chairman? A. I do not think there was a chairman.\nQ. Who was the secretary? A. There was no secretary. Q. Who had the voters' list? A. I think I had the voters' list.\nQ. Who gave you the voters' list? You were the secretary? A. I guess not.\nOn his cross-examination he says:\nQ. You told Mr. McCarthy you had been appointed Mr. Colter's agent in this last election? A. Yes.\nQ. In what way, agent for what? A. To act as scrutineer at the polling division of Jarvis.\nQ. Is that all you mean? A. Yes.\nQ. You mean the appointment in writing, I suppose? A. No, just to check the votes as they came in.\nQ. Did you get a written appointment? Or do you remember? A. I do not remember.\nQ. Did you see Mr. Colter personally about it? A. No.\nQ. Did you see him at all during the campaign, except at the public meetings? A. No.\nQ. Have any private talk with him at all? A. Never had a private talk with Mr. Colter.\nQ. And you were asked by somebody or other to be scrutineer? A. Yes.\nQ. You had once been scrutineer before at a previous election? A. No, I had been appointed but they got some other man in my place and I did not act.\nQ. At this time you did act? A. Yes.\nQ. As inside scrutineer? A. Yes.\nQ. Some party asked you to act? A. Yes.\nQ. Mr. Noble asked you to act, and you did act? A. I am not sure whether it was Mr. Noble or not.\nQ. Besides this was there any other work that you did at this election? A. No.\nQ. How was it you happened to go to this meeting? A. I was just told of it on the street and went.\nQ. Then you did not go from your own home intending to go to the meeting? A. No.\nThe judgment at the trial on the question of Haslett's agency was as follows:\n\"It remains to consider the question of agency. In dealing with this, regard must be had to the plan adopted by the party supporting Mr. Colter for carrying on the last campaign. Mr. Parker, Dr. Harrison and other leading reformers stated with some complacency that having discovered at the trial of an election petition in the county in October, 1887, that the conservative organization was superior to theirs they set out to remodel their own system so as to make it at least equal to that of their opponents. To this end they at once after said trial destroyed all the minutes of the county reform association which had been regularly kept since 1882; they immediately after every meeting of a convention and association destroyed the rough minutes of that meeting; and they substituted for the appointment of local committees vice-presidents (generally one for each township) which vice-presidents were named by the townships at meetings of the county association. There was no shibboleth or test for membership of the association, save only sympathising with the reform cause. The association was supposed to comprehend in its ranks every reformer within the limits Conventions are held by the township associations sending delegates.\"\n\"When a contest is approaching the vice-president or chairman of the township is instructed to call a meeting of the township association, to go over the lists, to appoint agents at the polls, bring out voters, look after absentees, &c., and the work is carried on by the aid of reformers who choose to assist.\"\n\"Shortly what is meant is this:\u2014\n(1.) As to the proceedings of the party as an organization there are to be no records except such as repose in frail human memory. As Mr. Parker puts it, 'so that no information could be got out of me except what I could remember.'\"\n\"(2) The abolition of local committees was apparently intended to serve a double purpose, viz., to lessen the apparent number of persons for whose acts the candidate might be responsible and to render it more difficult to ascertain afterwards who those persons were.\" \"It may be that in their avowed desire to improve on the tactics of their opponents, the friends of the respondent have increased instead of diminishing the number of his agents. Certain it is that the law of agency in election matters is so elastic that the courts will be astute to meet and cope with the ever-increasing ingenuity of some of those who manage election contests.\"\n\"The evidence of agency relied on by the petitioner is that Haslett has always been a reformer, has been active for two elections, that he was a scrutineer at the polls and that he attended one important committee meeting. No one of these elements is perhaps sufficient by itself to constitute Haslett an agent, but all taken together, with the recognition conferred on him by his local chief, Mr. Noble, in view of the state of affairs as regards organization which I have above alluded to, constrain me to hold him to have been an agent of the candidate.\"\n\"I therefore find that James Haslett, an agent of the respondent, committed the corrupt practice charged, without the knowledge or consent of the respondent.\"\nAylesworth for the appellant. The act of Haslett was not a corrupt act under the circumstances proved. Somerville v. Laflamme[1]; Windsor Election Case[2]; Kingston Election Case[3].\nA loan to induce a voter to be absent on election day has been held not a corrupt act. East Elgin Election Case[4].\nThe agency of Haslett was not proved. Berthier Election Case[5]\nMcCarthy Q.C. for the respondent, cited the judgment of Mr. Justice Patterson in Muskoka and Parry Sound Case[6]; West Simcoe Case[7]; Leigh & Le Marchant[8]; Mattinson & MacKaskie[9]; Limerick Case[10]; Waterford Case[11].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014Mr. Colter, the appellant, was nominated a candidate at a meeting of delegates selected from different parts of the riding of persons holding reform principles, and accepted the nomination. The regular nomination of candidates took place on the 23rd of January, 1889; the polling was on the 30th January, 1889; the trial of this petition was on the 3rd and 10th of September, 1889.\nTwo charges of corrupt practices by agents were considered by the learned judge who tried the petition and found to have been established. The first, which we have now to deal, with was alleged to have been by James Haslett to the effect that he offered and promised to pay one Henry Bridges $5 to induce him to refrain from voting at the said election. I think the petitioner has established that such an offer and payment were made; that the offer and the payment formed in fact one transaction though the offer and the payment were made at different times; and that a corrupt practice was thereby committed. The only question then that remains to be determined is as to the agency of Haslett. This agency should be established beyond all reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the learned judge and the burthen of the proof of agency was, in my opinion, clearly on the petitioner. As to the necessity of making a case out beyond all reasonable doubt ample authority is to be found.\nIn The Westminster Election Case[12] Mr. Baron Martin says\u2014 But I think I am justified, when I am about to apply such a law, in requiring to be satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the act of bribery was done, and that unless the proof is strong and cogent\u2014I should say very strong and very cogent\u2014it ought not to affect the seat of an honest and well-intentioned man by the act of a third person.\nIn The Taunton Case[13] Mr. Justice Grove says\u2014\nTo use the language of that eminent judge, the late Mr. Justice Willes, 'No amount of evidence ought to induce a judicial tribunal to act upon mere suspicion or to imagine the existence of evidence which might have been given by the petitioner, but which he has not thought it to his interest actually to bring forward, and to act upon that evidence and not upon the evidence which really has been brought forward. The second principle, which is more particularly applicable to circumstantial evidence, is this, that the circumstances to establish the affirmative of a proposition, where circumstantial evidence is relied upon, must be all, such of them as are believed, circumstances consistent with the affirmative, and that there must be some one or more circumstances believed by the tribunal, if you are dealing with a criminal case, inconsistent with any reasonable theory of innocence, and when you are dealing with a civil case (otherwise expressed though probably the result is for the most part the same), proving the probability of the affirmative to be so much stronger than that of the negative that a reasonable mind would adopt the affirmative in preference to the negative.'\n* * * * * * * *\nIn The Sligo Case[14]; Mr. Justice Keogh, as to the law of agency, said:\u2014\nAn observation was made by the counsel for the respondent that the evidence ought to be strong\u2014very strong, clear and conclusive\u2014of agency before a judge allows himself to attach the penalties of the Corrupt Practices Prevention Act, 1854, to any individual. I agree to that.\nAs to the nature of the evidence necessary to establish a charge of bribery, Judge O'Brien says in the Londonderry Case[15];\nThe charge of bribery, whether by a candidate or his agent, is one which should be established by clear and satisfactory evidence. The consequences resulting from such a charge being established are very serious. In the first place it avoids the election, and in the recent trial of the Warrington election petition, Baron Martin is reported to have said that he agreed with what had been said by Mr. Justice Willes at Lichfield, that before a judge upset a election, he ought to be satisfied beyond all doubt that the election was altogether void.\nAccepting then these cases as truly expounding the law as to the amount of evidence required to sustain charges of bribery and agency, let us consider how far the case has been made out beyond all reasonable doubt.\nThe learned judge after stating the plan adopted by the party supporting Mr. Colter for carrying on the campaign, says[16]:\nThe learned judge thus says it is by combining the three considerations, viz: the organization of the association, the attendance at the meeting of the appellant and the appointment of the appellant as scrutineer that the agency is made out, and that neither alone would establish it.\nNow, as to Haslett's having acted as scrutineer, whether appointed to that position by the appellant, or acting as such at the request of Noble, a vice-president for the township of Walpole, or as one of the electors under section 36 of the Election Act, R.S.C. ch. 8, by no means clearly appears, but assuming that he was duly appointed to and acted in that capacity at the poll in the interests of the appellant, did this constitute him an agent of the appellant generally and make the appellant liable for his acts committed before such appointment? I think not, and I think the learned judge should not have considered that appointment as an element in determining the question of agency. The appointment of such an agent as provided for by R.S.C. ch. 8, secs. 36 and 38, has clearly reference only to the proceedings on polling day and, therefore, the whole question of agency must turn on the fact of Haslett having attended a so called committee meeting shortly before this election, probably a couple of weeks, and of being a person professing reform principles. Would these two establish the agency? As I read the judgment they would not, for the learned judge says, \"It is the combination of the three that does it not the combination of any two.\" But I think the question of being a reformer must be also eliminated. Colter did not accept the nomination directly from the reformers of Haldimand, for it is abundantly clear that those who nominated Colter were not the body of the reformers of the Riding but a select body of delegates, of whom Haslett was not one, who when appointed were no doubt from, but entirely independent of, the whole body of persons holding the views of the reformers. Having accepted such nomination I cannot think he thereby made all persons in the constituency professing reform principles his agents. In this case it is not necessary to enquire how far or to what extent, if any, he made the members of that convention his agents; it is for the purposes of this case sufficient to say that he did not, apart from them, make all or any of the persons professing reform principles his agents unless he or his agents gave them the authority to act for him or recognised their right to do so by adopting their acts. This leaves then only the attendance at the meeting which the learned judge admits would not alone be sufficient to establish the agency. Had he not attended this meeting I can see no pretence whatever for the contention that he was an agent of Mr. Colter. It does not appear that this meeting was held at the instance or even with the knowledge of the candidates, or was called by or held at the instance of any person having the charge or management of the election or in any way authorized to call or hold it. There was no evidence that Haslett canvassed; on the contrary he distinctly swears that he did not; nor is there any evidence that he did any other act directly or indirectly touching the election save and except attending the meeting in question, of which he swears he had only accidentally heard, and going through the list in order to ascertain who the absent voters were. This is the account he gives of the meeting and he is the only witness who speaks of it. (His Lordship here read the evidence of Haslett which will be found in the statement of facts at p. 174.)\nHaslett does not appear to have been in any way entrusted with any duty whatever of managing or influencing the election, or procuring Mr. Colter's return, and he does not appear ever to have spoken to Mr. Colter; in fact he says he never spoke to him. There is not a tittle of evidence that Colter by any act or deed in any way authorized Haslett to act for him or recognized him as his agent directly or indirectly, or ratified or adopted any of his acts. Haslett appears to have been simply a volunteer, not selected by Colter or any person having any authority in connection with the management and conduct of the election, nor does he appear to have been in any way in the counsels of those conducting the election.\nI think the cases clearly establish that there must be an appointment as agent or an acting in the business of the election with the knowledge and consent of the candidate or of some person duly authorized to give him power to act in the election or some adoption or ratification of his acts by the candidate or his duly authorized agent, or such on acting in the business of the election with the knowledge of the candidate or his agent from which authority to act can be inferred, all of which appear to me to be entirely wanting in this case. The Westminster Case[17] Mr. Baron Martin\u2014\nI have said, and the other judges have said, that bribing by one of his committee would affect the candidate; but by a 'committee' I meant a number of persons, comparatively few (of course in a county that extends over a considerable district it would be larger), who were entrusted by the candidate with the work of carrying out his election, in whom he put faith and trust, and who, in fact, were his agents for the purpose of carrying it out; but I have never supposed, nor do I believe that either Mr. Justice Blackburn or Mr. Justice Willes ever considered, that where a number of people (600 or 700) choose to call themselves 'a committee' thereupon they become 'agents' of the candidate for the purpose of making him responsible for an illegal act done by one of them. I think it is a conclusion that could not be borne out by common sense. The committee-man whom I mean, and whom I would hold the respondent to be responsible for, is a committee man in the ordinary intelligible sense of the word, that is to say, a person in whom faith is put by the candidate, and for whose acts therefore he is responsible.\nHow can it be said in this case that Haslett was such a committee man?\nIn The Londonderry Case[18] Mr. Justice O'Brien, on the question of agency, said\u2014\nIt is clear (as held in the Windsor Case) that the employment of a man as messenger is not sufficient to constitute him an agent. Mr. Justice Willes in that case, in those accurate terms for which he is remarkable, said, 'I have stated that authority to canvass\u2014and I purposely used the word authority and not employment, because I meant the observation to apply to persons authorized to canvass, whether paid or not for their services\u2014would, in my opinion, constitute an agent.' I cannot concur in the opinion that any supporter of a candidate who chooses to ask others for their votes and to make speeches in his favor, can force himself upon the candidate as an agent, or that a candidate should be held responsible for the acts of one from whom he actually endeavors to disassociate himself.\nIn The Taunton Case[19] Mr. Justice Grove says\u2014\nSo far as regards the present case, I am of opinion that to establish agency for which the candidate would be responsible he must be proved by himself or by his authorized agent to have employed the persons whose conduct is impugned to act on his behalf, or to have to some extent put himself in their hands, or to have made common cause. with them for the purpose of promoting his election. To what extent such relation may be sufficient to fix the candidate must, it seems to me, be a question of degree and evidence to be judged of by the election petition tribunal. Mere non-interference with persons who, feeling interested in the success of the candidate, may act in support of his canvass, is not sufficient, in my judgment, to saddle the candidate with any unlawful act of theirs of which the tribunal is satisfied he or his authorized agent is ignorant. It would be vain to attempt an exhaustive definition, and possibly exception may be taken to the approximate limitation which I have endeavored to express.\nIn The Windsor Case[20] the report states that\u2014\nIn the course of the case, it was proved that one Pantling wrote a letter to a voter named Juniper, who at the time of the election was away from the Borough, offering to pay his travelling expenses if he would come and vote; and it was admitted that this offer, if made by the respondent or an agent of his, would have unseated him. The only evidence of Pantling being an agent was that he was a member of a committee which had been formed for the purpose of promoting the respondent's election. It was not proved who put him on the committee, or how he got there, what his duties were, or what he did; but his own statement as to this was that he understood that his duties were to do the best he could for the respondent.\nMr. Baron Bramwell, in his judgment, said as to this:\nI am invited to believe that in some way or other a man who has given no description of himself, except that he was on a committee, was an agent so that his act in writing this letter should unseat the respondent. It appears to me really impossible to hold that he was an agent. I think that according to the authorities, and according to the good sense of the matter, he was not an agent. He has given us no account of how he came to write this letter to Juniper, he having told him where he had gone to and having told him to write upon the occasion of an election. I cannot help agreeing with Mr. Giffard that if we were to hold this man to be an agent it would make the law of agency as applicable to candidates positively hateful and ludicrous.\nThe Stroud Case[21]. Mr. Baron Pigott:\u2014\nIt is clear that a person is not to be made an agent of the sitting member by his merely acting, that is not enough; he must act in promotion of the election, and he must have authority, or there must be circumstances from which we can infer authority.\nBorough of Dungannon[22]. Baron Fitzgerald: \u2014 I think it must be made out that a party, before he is chargeable as an agent, has been entrusted in some way or other by the candidate with some material part of the business of the election which ordinarily is performed, or is supposed to be performed, by the candidate himself. Whether it has any distinct reference to canvassing or anything of that kind, appears to me to be immaterial, but in some sense or another he must be considered as entrusted by the candidate with the performance of some part of the business of the election, which properly belongs to the candidate himself, though he is unable to perform it in many cases without somebody to aid him. But that entrusting may be made out not merely by an express appointment to the performance of some material duty in reference to the election, but may be made out by implication. The circumstances of each case may differ, but that implication ordinarily must arise from the knowledge which it appears that the candidate has of the part which the person is taking in the election. If that part of the business of an election which ordinarily and properly belongs to the candidate himself be done to the knowledge of the candidate by some other person, it appears to me that that other person is an agent of the candidate, and the candidate is responsible for any corrupt act done by that person.\nHow can it be said that anything that was done by Haslett was done with the knowledge of Mr. Colter, or that anything was entrusted to Haslett by Colter or by any person authorized to give Haslett authority to act?\nCan it be said that the agency has been established in this case beyond all reasonable doubt? The most that can be said, I think, is that there are suspicious circumstances in relation to the bribery but it is clear that these suspicions will not do.\nUnder these circumstances I am of opinion the agency was not established and therefore as to this charge the appeal should be allowed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014For the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Falconbridge in giving judgment in the court below on charge No. 82 (which I adopt in their entirety, and to which I have nothing to add) I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. TASCHEREAU J.\u2014On that charge 82, \"that on or about the day of election in question James Haslett, an agent of the respondent (now appellant), offered and promised to pay and did pay to Henry Brydges, a voter in the same electoral district, the sum of $5 to induce him, the said Brydges, to refrain from voting at the election in question, or to vote thereat for the said respondent (now appellant),\" the evidence is conclusive. I need not repeat the facts of the case. They, it seems to me, show a clear and unmistakable act of corrupt practice, and we are, I believe, unanimous on this point.\nI have great doubts, however, on the question of Haslett's agency. I am free to say that had I presided at the trial, with the evidence on record, as I read it, I would have hesitated before finding agency. On the other hand, I am impressed here with the grave and obvious reasons which, in cases of this kind more particularly, should restrain an appellate court from interfering with the finding of the judge at the trial. I have not succeeded yet in bringing my mind to that point of certainty always required to reverse. At the same time, I see the difficulty of finding on this record clear evidence of agency. I cannot say that I have made up my mind one way or the other, and if my conclusions were to affect the result of the judgment I would require more time to consider the point. But as a majority of the court have come to a final determination of the matter it would have been utterly useless for me to delay the judgment, a course I would not, it seems to me, have been justified in taking in a case of this nature, where public interests require a judgment as speedily as possible.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The questions in this case are purely questions of fact and I cannot say that the conclusions upon them, which have been arrived at by the learned judge who tried the election petition, are clearly erroneous. I cannot say that the evidence clearly does not justify the conclusion that the organization of the reform association in the County of Haldimand, as detailed in the evidence, (and of which organization the appellant was an approving member, and whose nomination as a candidate, which was offered to him by a convention of the association in pursuance of the scheme of organization, he accepted), was devised for the purpose of giving to a candidate brought forward by a convention of the association the benefits of the organization as a general committee of the candidate without exposing him to the risk attending his nomination of committeemen to manage and conduct the election for him Nor can I say that the evidence clearly does not justify the conclusion that the attendance by James Haslett at the committee meeting held at Hanrahan's Hotel was an act done by him in perfect accordance with the scheme of organization, and in pursuance of it in the character of a committeeman acting in the interest of and as an agent of the candidate, just as if he had been appointed by the candidate himself. If these conclusions do not appear to my mind to be clearly erroneous I must adhere to the rule laid down by this court, and acted upon in several cases, and among these in the Bellechasse Election Case[23] and decline to interfere and to reverse as beyond all doubt erroneous the judgment of the learned judge who tried the case upon mere questions of fact. I entirely concur in the observation of the learned judge, to the effect that the courts should be astute to meet and cope with the ever-increasing ingenuity of those who manage election contests. This timely suggestion thus thrown out appears to me to be a mild criticism by no means inappropriate to the evidence given in this case, as to the origin, the object and the modus operandi of the organization in the County of Haldimand. The appeal must, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs, and the result communicated in the ordinary way to the Speaker of the House of Commons.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The decision that the act of bribery which constituted charge 82 was committed by Haslett was so amply sustained by the reported evidence that, after hearing from Mr. Aylesworth all that could be urged against the view taken by the learned judge, we did not think it necessary to hear Mr. McCarthy on that subject.\nOn the question as to Haslett's agency there is more to be said on both sides but no sufficient reason has, in my judgment, been shewn for interfering with the finding of the learned judge who presided at the trial and who heard and saw the witnesses.\nThe rule which will be found a safe one to bear in mind in approaching a question of election agency was well stated many years ago by Mr. Justice Grove in the Wakefield Case[24], in language which has lost none of its force, and is still applicable to contests like the present. After speaking of the impossibility of laying down such definitions and limits as shall meet every case he said:\nIt is therefore well that it should be understood that it rests with the judge, not misapplying or straining the law, but applying the principles of the law to changed states of facts, to form his opinion as to whether there has or has not been what constitutes agency in these election matters. It is well that the public should know that they cannot evade the difficulty by merely getting, as they suppose, out of the technical meaning of certain words and phrases.\nMany reported cases illustrate the application of the general principles referred to widely differing states of facts, cases found in the English reports and in those of our own provinces, as well as some which have been before this court. It would not serve any useful purpose to refer to them in detail, while to do so might perhaps tend to suggest the erroneous idea that the doctrine was in some way limited to facts like those on which the decisions turned.\nThis caution may not be unnecessary, especially when English cases are referred to. The principles acted on in those cases will be found to be wide enough and elastic enough to reach every variety of facts, yet under the system on which elections are conducted in this country facts may exist, and may be expected to exist, differing from those found in England much more than the facts of one English case will ordinarily differ from those in another English case. This difference is notably found in the relation of a candidate to his constituency, the mode of selecting the candidate, and the machinery for conducting the contest.\nI have had occasion more than once to discuss the subject of election agency and to act upon my opinion. Amongst other cases there are three reported in the first volume of the Ontario Election Oases. I refer to portions of the judgments delivered by me in the Prescott Case[25]; the West Simcoe Case[26]; the Muskoka Case[27]; repeating the caution that I do so for the enunciation of general principles, and not because of the facts appearing to be like those now before us, and referring to the reports in place of repeating what I then said.\nWhen an election is approaching, the custom in the county of Haldimand is shown to be for a convention of the reform association of the county to nominate a candidate.\nMr. Colter, the present appellant, was nominated for the election now in question, as he had been on more than one previous occasion, and he accepted the nomination.\nThere was, as there of necessity must have been, some understanding as to the mode in which the contest was to be carried on. Work had to be done. That is shown by the evidence, though proof of the fact was hardly needed. Who was to do the work? Was the candidate to do it himself personally or did he rely on the aid of others? The understanding on the subject may have been expressed or have been tacit. These contests were no new thing in the county. The association had been in operation for a number of years, and unless a change in the way of doing things was intended the plan of campaign would not be likely to be talked over at every nomination. The modus operandi was already established and sufficiently understood.\nMr. Parker, the secretary of the association, gives information as to the general character of the work to be done and the very active part taken by himself, not taken, as he tells us, by reason of any consultation with Mr. Colter or with other leading men, though he had frequent communication with Colter who would inquire how he was getting on and so forth. He was asked:\nQ. What part was Mr. Colter taking in the contest? A. Conducting his meetings, I suppose; I never attended any of his meetings.\nQ. You were seeing to the organization of the portion of the riding that you have spoken of? A. Yes.\nQ. Then Mr. Colter, so far as you know, was attending the public meetings. And was he also looking after the organization? A. Not that I know of.\nQ. Did he say that to you? A. No. I suppose he would get some person else to attend to the other portion of the riding, to do the work I was doing in the part I attended to. There is abundant evidence, apart from the necessity of the case, that many persons must have been relied on by the candidate to do the work of seeing to get voters out and whatever else an organized canvas required. These persons, whoever they were, must be held to be the agents of the candidate.\nWork had to be done. No means, apart from the organization of the association, were provided for doing it. The candidate was not doing it himself.\nMr. Colter was himself an active member of the association for six or seven years preceding 1886. Then he was nominated as candidate and went through two elections before the one now in contest under the auspices of the association. He was, therefore, familiar with the way in which things were done. The organization included local associations. There was one for the township of Walpole, which is the scene of charge 82. The associations comprise all the reformers of the locality, though only a few of them, according to Mr. Parker, usually take an active part.\nHaslett had been active at the last two elections, though he modestly says he did but very little. That little, he says, was going out and getting in voters.\nHe afterwards said that it was only at the last election that he took an active part. One thing which he did was to attend a meeting held one night in the village where he lives.\nQ. How long was that before the election? A. Probably a couple of weeks.\nQ. Who gave you notice to attend that meeting? A. Well, there was nobody gave notice.\nQ. How did you know about it? A. Well, we just met one another on the street.\nQ. Who was it told you? A. I could not say.\nQ. Was it a day meeting or a night meeting? A. Night.\nQ. And was that the meeting when the affairs of the polling subdivison were arranged? A. No. Q. What was done at that meeting? A. Just to look up the outside vote and seeing about getting it in.\nQ. What else? What about the doubtful vote at home? A. There was nothing particular done about that.\nQ. You went over the voters' list, I suppose? A. Yes.\nQ. And were doubtful men assigned to different parties to be seen after? A. No.\nQ. For what purpose, then, did you go over the list? A. Just to kind of see; have an idea how many men were outside the county.\nQ. That was the particular business? A. Yes.\nQ. And how long did the meeting last? A. Perhaps an hour.\nQ. And who was the chairman? A. I do not think there was a chairman.\nQ. Who was the secretary? A. There was no secretary.\nQ. Who had the voters' list? A. I think I had the voters' list.\nSome interest and activity are implied by the incident of his being provided with the voters' list, which was of some use for the purposes of the meeting.\nThese questions and answers of Haslett have been pressed on the part of the appellant as proving that, a meeting having been called by some one, Haslett casually heard of it, and that his being there was so casual and unpremeditated as to have no significance on the question of his position in relation to the organized work of the election. It is possible that that is what the witness meant to convey by his answers, but it is not what he said. If we take the answers literally, as reported to us, they are consistent with the notion that Haslett may himself have arranged for the meeting and invited his neighbors, and that notion would not be discredited by the circumstance that Haslett was the man who had the voters' list at the meeting.\nThe want of written or formal notices of the meeting does not strike me as a circumstance of any importance as an indication of Haslett having heard only by chance of this meeting, particularly when it is remembered that the policy of the association, in which the tactics of another association on a different side of politics are said to have been adopted, was to have no written evidence to produce on an election trial. Obviously there was some sufficient notice to bring the men together whether Haslett gave the notice or received it. The evidence as we have it certainly does not, to my mind, account for his presence at the meeting in any way which weakens the effect, whatever the effect should properly be, of the fact of his attending the meeting with his voters' list and assisting at the business for which the meeting was convened.\nIt is not my purpose to go at greater length into an examination of the evidence, though I have not failed to consider it with care, because I do not understand it to be the duty of the court to deal with it as if trying the fact as a court of first instance. We have not to disturb the finding of the trial judge unless satisfied that his finding is wrong. It rested with him, as said by Mr. Justice Grove in the passage I have quoted, to form his opinion as to whether there had or had not been in the case of Haslett what constitutes election agency. I see no reason to impute to him, in connection with that enquiry, any misapplication or straining of the law of election agency, nor can I say he arrived at a wrong decision on the facts, although on the same evidence all persons might not arrive at the same conclusion.\nIn the short reference I have made to the evidence I have touched but slightly upon the fact, which to my mind is an important one and which distinguishes most elections in this country from most of those in England, that the candidate makes no provision for doing many things which we know from common knowledge must be done. The election is in fact less the business of the candidate than of the party organisation by which he is nominated. Nor have I placed any stress upon the appointment of Haslett is scrutineer at the last election. That, by itself, occurring as it did after the act of bribery, would not prove agency at an earlier period, or agency for any other purpose than the purpose specified in his appointment. At the same time it is a fact that may fairly be considered in connection with any part he may have taken in the election work. I mean work of a systematic kind, such as meeting to go over the voters' lists or the like, not merely advocating the candidate or the cause, like the person whose agency was in question in the Prescott case[28] to which I have already referred.\nIt is urged that the extension (as it is called) of the scope of election agency to include persons like Haslett exposes candidates to risk to an unreasonable extent. The result, if it follows, seems to be due to the footing upon which party organizations have placed these matters. I have nothing to do with the merits or defects of the system as a method of collecting the suffrages of the constituencies. It is not my province to discuss it from the standpoint of either logic or politics. What I am concerned with is to ascertain whether a person convicted of committing a corrupt act in the interest of a candidate has been properly held to come within the description of agent for the candidate. If I find that a candidate who takes the field as the nominee of a party that acts through an organized association, whether the organization is strict and formal, or loose and elastic, depends upon the efforts of the association to promote his election, or relies upon such efforts, I must, as I understand the principles of the law, hold all persons accredited by the association to be the agents of the candidate. Whether a particular individual does or does not come within the description is a question of fact.\nI cannot say that I am impressed by the suggested danger of hardship to candidates or constituencies of letting the validity of an election be imperilled by the conduct of any one of so many people as may be election agents in a case like the present. The danger to the purity of election at which our legislation aims from holding a candidate free from risk from the corrupt acts of those on whom he relies for the conduct of his election, seems to be at least as great and as worthy of being guarded against.\nI agree that we should dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: A.

The appellant, in her quality of executrix of her deceased husband's will sued the respondent Harriet Elizabeth Kerr, for the sum of $6,044.22, of which $3,064 was for the amount of a notarial obligation and hypothec, dated 8th January, 1880, and given by one T. C. Fields in his quality of tutor to said Harriet Elizabeth Kerr, and $2,360.22 was for the amount of another notarial obligation and hypothec given by the said Harriet Elizabeth Kerr on the 23rd of February 1885, the appellant alleging that in the said last mentioned obligation the said Harriet Elizabeth Kerr had ratified the first obligation granted by her tutor. To this action the respondent, Harriet Elizabeth Kerr, pleaded that she was not indebted; that the obligation of the 8th of January,1880,was illegal, null and void; that Fields had never been legally authorized to borrow money from the appellant for her; that if Fields received any money from appellant it was for himself; that she had abundant means to live on and no necessity existed for borrowing more on her behalf there was no cause nor consideration given for said obligations and hypothec; that her signature to the last mentioned obligation was obtained from her by threats and violence practised upon her by George Simpson, subrogate tutor and agent of the appellant as well as trustee and heir of his late father, Robert Simpson, and by Mrs. Fields on the advice of whom she was accustomed to rely when was in a feeble condition of health, bodily and mentally.\nAt the same time the appellant brought an hypothecary action against the respondent, Mary Louisa Kerr, for the amount of the obligation granted by the deed of the 8th of January 1880 and ratified by the deed of the 23rd of February, 1885. To this action the respondent, Mary Louisa Kerr, pleaded that the obligation of the 8th of January, 1880, was illegal, null and void.\nThe Superior Court gave judgment in the action Against Harriet Elizabeth Kerr in favor of the appellant for the sum of $2380 62,being the amount of the obligation of the 23rd of February, 1885, and dismissed the action for the surplus, holding that the obligation of the 8th of January, 1880, was null and void, having been executed without the observance of the formalities required by law which constitute of minors under such circumstances; and as regards the hypothecary action the obligation which it was based being annulled it was dismissed.\nEach party appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) from the judgments of the Superior Court in the suit of Davis v. Harriet Elizabeth Kerr, and the plaintiff appealed in the suit of Davis v. Mary Louisa Kerr. Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) dismissed both actions with costs.\nThree appeals were then taken to the Supreme Court of Canada and were argued together.\nThe evidence given in support of the respondents' pleas is fully reviewed in the reports of the case in the courts below ([2]) and in the judgment of Mr. Justice Taschereau hereinafter given.\nLaflamme Q.C. for appellant.\nThe principal question which arises in these cases is :\nWas the tutor, Fields, legally authorised to execute the obligation of the 8th January, 1880; if not, was the want of proper authorization, or the irregularity which accompanied it, remedied and effaced by the ratification and confirmation by Harriet E. Kerr as mentioned in the obligation of the 23rd of February, 1885?\nThe requirements of the law (arts. 297 and 298, and 1010 C.C.) were complied with and it is proven that at least $6000 of improvements had been made on the property of the minor when the loan was applied for.\nNow the authority to whom is entrusted the care of protecting the minors, and who is invested with judicially determining the power to borrow money on behalf of minors and to sanction any loan so made, is conclusive unless there be fraud on the part of the lender, or notice given to him, or that he has direct knowledge of serious irregularities. Such authorisation must be held a complete protection for the party advancing the money which cannot be questioned by the minor or his representatives at any subsequent period. It is obvious that if the party from whom the minor seeks to obtain means which he needs is bound to guarantee the action of the judiciary, and if the minor after many years could question the correctness and the truth of the allegations sanctioned a proper tribunal no minor could find relief and protection from ruin when necessity, his manifest interests, would require the assistance and loan of capital.\nThen as to ratification I contend that under art. 1008 C.C. the Plaintiff is entitled to recover the full amount acknowledged to have been received by her unless she can prove violence or fear within the meaning of arts. 994 and 995. Upon this question the Superior Court gave judgment in favor of the appellant and the evidence fully justifies this finding.\nAs to art 1214 C.C. The true meaning of the article is the expression of the existing law on the subject and as explained by our old authorities and best commentator son the corresponding articles of the French Code. Articles 1337, 1338, clearly show that article 1214 applies to ratification in general terms as not sufficient to cover nullities unknown to the party ratifying and not disclosed in the original deed, but was never intended and cannot be intended to exact from the party obtaining the ratification a detailed mention of all the grounds of objection or irregularities which could be opposed to the original obligation.\nThe ratification set up in the present case is more an actual execution of the original obligation than a ratification proper and the free execution of a deed otherwise valid in form and substance, implies a renunciation of the right to invoke any nullities, which is equal in effect to an express formal ratification. Moreover all the conditions required by the article 1214 are fulfilled by this act of ratification in which the substance of the obligation is mentioned and specially referred to. The obligation was for and on behalf of the party ratifying who was then alleged to be a minor; the only cause of nullity would be the fact that the property was mortgaged by the tutor without the proper formalities; but two years' after the majority of the minor, she expressly ratifies the act and declares it to be binding on her. What more direct expression as to the substance of the obligation the cause of its being voidable and the intention to make it valid, can be found than what this deed of ratification contains? She knew of the existence of the mortgage, the circumstances under which it was granted. She must be presumed to have taken cognizance of it. She must be held in the same manner as if it were the ratification of an act done on her behalf without her consent and knowledge. Every authority declares that any ratification of an act done by a third party without authority is completely binding if the party in whose name the same was done thinks proper to approve of it.\nThe learned counsel cited Rolland de Villargues, Dic. du Droit Civil, ([3]); Duranton, ([4]); Toullier, ([5]); Freminville, de la Minorite, ([6]); Solon, Nullit\u00e9s, ([7]).\nAs to the case against Mary Louisa Kerr, if the mortgage should be held valid the hypothecary action would necessarily be maintained.\nHutchinson for respondent.\nThe tutor has no authority to borrow on behalf of the minor nor to hypothecate his immovable property without the authorization of the judge or prothonotary and that only in case of necessity or for the evident advantage of the minor. Arts. 297, 298 267 269 C. C. Mesl\u00e9 ([8]); Lamoignon Arr\u00eat\u00e9s de ([9]); Argou ([10]); Pothier, Obligations ([11]); Pothier, Vente ([12]); Toullier, Droit Civil ([13]).\nThe law provides that in case of necessity the judge or the prothonotary can only give the authorization required when it is established by a summary account submitted by the tutor that the moneys moveable effects and revenues of the minor are insufficient. The question therefore at once arises '. Did the tutor present an account and show that the moneys moveable effects and revenues of the minor were insufficient? Of course, with this provision of the law staring the tutor and the family council in the face some account had to be presented, and some attempt had to be made to show the prothonotary from whom the authorization was asked that the moneys moveable effects and revenues of the minor were insufficient. How was it done? Simply by resorting to\u2014falsehood.\nThe next question of importance which presents itself is to know what knowledge the appellant, who it is alleged lent this money, had of the deception that was practised upon the prothonotary, in order to get this authorization, and as to the necessity which existed on the part of the minor to borrow this money.\nIn the first place the appellant, who is an elderly lady, acted in this matter entirely through her son, George Simpson. This fact appears by her own evidence, consequently the knowledge of her agent is the knowledge of the appellant. And Greorge Simpson had full knowledge of everything that was done by the tutor with respect to borrowing this money. He was also the subrogate tutor of the said minor, Harriet Elizabeth Kerr.\nMoreover the law does not entitle a tutor to borrow money and mortgage the property of his minor as security for the loan of money with which to pay himself. Sirey Codes annot\u00e9s, ([14]); Chardon, Trait\u00e9 des trois puissances, ([15]); Demolombe Code Civil, ([16]). The learned counsel also referred to Beliveau v. Chevrefils, ([17]); Poustie v. McGregor ([18]).\nIt is, however, pretended by the appellant that even if this mortgagee given by the respondent's tutor was valueless and without effect, yet the respondent, after she became of age, ratified and confirmed it by a subsequent deed of the 23rd of February, 1885.\nIn answer to this, the respondent says :\u2014\nThat this pretended ratification cannot avail the appellant inasmuch as the first deed of the 8th of January, 1880, being voidable as above shown, it is necessary that the act of ratification should expressly recite the substance of the former obligation and set forth the cause of its being voidable, and also expressly mention that it is the intention of the parties to cover ,the nullity, which has not been done. Art. 1214.\nAs to the second obligation of the 23rd February, 1885 the respondent contends that this obligation is also entirely null and void and without effect because the respondent never received any lawful cause or consideration for the said obligation. Art. 989.\nOn the question of duress, I refer to art. 994, 995, 996 C.C.; Pothier on Obligations, ([19]); Marcad\u00e9, ([20]); Duranton, ([21]). The evidence is ample to justify the conclusion arrived at on this question of fact by the Court of Appeal.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\u2014\nTASCHEREAU J\u2014On the 2nd of January, 1880, one Thomas Craig Fields, in his quality of tutor to the defendant Harriet Elizabeth Kerr, then a minor, obtained from the prothonotary of the district of Terrebonne, acting in lieu of a judge, the authorisation to borrow from the present plaintiff the sum of $3,664 for and in the name of the defendant, upon the security of a mortgage on the properties of the defendant situated at St. Andrew's within the said district. Pursuant to that authorisation on the 8th of the same month the said tutor passed an obligation in the defendant's name in favor of the plaintiff for the said amount, and it is that amount inter alia, that the plaintiff now seeks to recover from the defendant by the present action.\nThe defendant pleads to the action that she received no consideration for the obligation sued upon; that the authorisation granted to her tutor to borrow for her the said amount and give a mortgage therefor on her property was null and void; and that the amount thereof went to pay her tutor's personal debts. She has made out that plea, in my opinion, as to a great portion of this item of the demand.\nIt appears that the plaintiff's transactions in this matter with Thomas Craig Fields were negotiated entirely through her son, one George Simpson, who was her general business agent.\nThis George Simpson carried on a general store with his brother, Moses, and the firm had on the 8th January, 1880, an account in their books against T. C. Fields, personally, for $1,381.\nThis same George Simpson was the defendant's subtutor. In December, 1879, he, apparently getting anxious to obtain a settlement from Fields of the large amount standing against him in his hooks, concocted with him, Fields, the tutor, upon the suggestion and advice of a notary named Howard whose conduct in the matter I cannot but qualify as deserving of severest censure, the means to get himself paid by this minor child of these $1,381 due to him by Fields personally under cover of a loan from his mother, the present plaintiff, to this minor.\nA family council had by law to be called for the purpose. One was assembled accordingly before that notary Howard, who knew all the parties, on the 26th Dec, 1879, at the request of the tutor, Fields, and was composed of George Simpson himself, Field's creditor, and agent of the lender, of Moses Simpson, his brother and partner, and as such also Field's creditor, of L. T. Simpson another brother and creditor for $84 of one Christie Davis their uncle and the lender's brother of one Howard, the notary's son, and two others who are said to have been then George Simpson's clerks.\nThese seven persons \u201c having been duly sworn upon the holy evangelists, and having examined the tutor's declaration, and the summary statement of accounts produced by him, and maturely deliberated together, were unanimously of opinion that it was expedient and necessary that the said tutor should be authorised to borrow from Lurena Davis (the present plaintiff) for and on behalf of the said minor, $3,664 and to mortgage \" the said minor's property as security for the said loan.\" Such are the very words of the notary's acte or proc\u00e9s verbal of the deliberations of the family council.\nThe prothonotary of the district a few days after homologated these proceedings in apparently the loosest possible manner. Acting in a judicial capacity, and bound by law to scrupulously scan every proceeding brought before him that might in any way be prejudicial to minor children's interests this officer granted the permission to mortgage this young girls property for the large amount of $3,664 without making any inquiry whatsoever, without having the family council or the tutor or the sub-tutor examined before him and even without requiring from the tutor the summary account of the minor's revenues required by art. 298 C.C. In utter disregard of the duties assigned to him in the matter and seemingly unconscious of the responsibility attached to his functions, he contented himself with relying upon the notary's proceedings, and granted the authority to borrow a large sum in this minor's name without any attempt whatever to exercise his own judgment on the merits of the application or on the necessity of the loan. A more iniquitous proceeding, a more glaring fraud against the law, is hardly conceivable ; and that it should have so readily received the sanction of two public officers in the province demonstrates, it seems to me, that the protection due to minors is not, under the system there in force, always surrounded with the proper safeguards. A family council called to protect the minor and advise on the opportunity of a loan for her, composed of two of the creditors who are to be paid from the proceeds of that loan, one of them the special agent of the lender, three of them sons of the lender, and a fourth a brother of the lender, called together on a petition of the debtor, whose debt to two of the council is to be paid from the proceeds of the loan ; all of them swearing upon the holy Evangelists that after having maturely deliberated they are unanimously of opinion that, in the minor's interest, the loan from their mother was expedient and necessary; and all this upon the petition of a tutor who is to get his share of the loan; is a proceeding so ludicrous that 1 would think it fanciful if I had not this record before me. The whole transaction was evidently nothing but a deceitful contrivance, and this to the knowledge of the plaintiff, through her agent.\nA party who lends money to a minor, through her tutor legally authorized to borrow, is not bound to see that these moneys are really expended in the minor's interest; neither has he, when in good faith, to go behind the judicial order that authorises the loan if such order on its face is legal and regular. But the plaintiff here was, through her agent, a party to the illegality and fraud against the law which entirely vitiates the authorisation to effect this loan from her. She the lender, formed, through her agent, part of the family council called to get her to determine upon oath whether or not, in the minor's interest this loan was expedient or necessary. She, through her agent, knew that the proceeds of a great part of this loan were to go to the agent himself. She, through her agent, was aware that no summary of the minor child's revenues had been submitted to the prothonotary or family council as required by law. Qui mandat ipse fecisse videtur. I am of opinion that all this a n\u00e9cessairement eu pour effet de vicier dans son essence m\u00eame la constitution du conseil de famille. Re Gielly ([22]). Fraus et dolus nemini patrocinere debent.\nI do not lose sight of the fact that Simpson, examined as a witness, swears that it was to Fields as tutor for the defendant this $1,381 was advanced, but this is directly contradicted by his own books where the amount stands charged to Fields personally, and then, were this true the fact remains that the loan to that amount was to go to him, Simpson, who formed part of the family council. And this, in my opinion, absolutely avoids this authorisation, not only as, to the $1,381, but as to the whole amount of the loan. Could it be contended, however, that the loan was legally effected as to the surplus over the $1,381, there remains the objection to this surplus that, on Field's own statement produced before the family council upon his own application, as tutor to borrow for his pupil this surplus was to reimburse him, Fields, as creditor of his pupil, for advances made and money expended for her. The illegality of this is patent. Sirey ([23]). Where the interest of a minor is to be considered and dealt with uberrima fides must be the rule and the law will neither allow proceedings to be instituted for a minor by a tutor interested in the result nor tolerate in the family council the presence of any party who has directly or indirectly an interest in the matter submitted for consideration. Towards a tutor, a sub-tutor or a member of a family council, more than to any others perhaps, the tribunals are bound to rigorously enforce the wholesome doctrine that \" no one having duties of a fiduciary character to discharge shall be allowed to enter into engagements or assume functions in which he has or can have a personal interest conflicting or which possibly may conflict with the interests of those he is bound to protect;'' or as the Privy Council tersely puts it in Bank of Upper Canada v. Bradshaw ([24]), that an agent or mandatary (and a tutor or a sub-tutor are mandataries) cannot be allowed to put his duty in conflict with his interest.\nI do not think, however, that this entails the dismissal of the whole of the action as to this item. Anyone who lends money to a tutor even not legally authorized to borrow for the minor or even to a minor himself without the intervention of his tutor has the right to recover all of this loan which he the lender proves to have been used to the advantage and benefit of the minor. This is unquestionable. I need only refer on this and other points arising on the case, to the authorities cited in Miller v. Demeule ([25]) * and to Gagnon v Sylva ([26]); Venner v. Lortie ([27]) : Demolombe ([28]); Laurent ([29]); Sirey ([30]); Sirey ([31]); Urquhart v. Scott ([32]); Payne v. Scott ([33]).\nThe issue on this item of the demand is consequently reduced to a mere question of evidence. For what amount has the defendant been proved to have benefited? The evidence of this is very meagre. There are on the one hand three witnesses who estimate the additional value given by Fields to the defendant's property at from $3,000 to $6,000. But on the other hand it is in evidence that Fields during his administration received from New York and elsewhere for the defendant divers large sums of money. So that it is impossible to tell, Fields being now dead, precisely which portion of this loan was spent on the property. Yet the plaintiff cannot recover more than what she has actually established to have benefited the defendant. That amount I cannot find to be from this record over $1,230, that is to say $1,000 paid to McIntosh on a previous mortgage he had on the defendant\u2019s property, and $230 for the outbuildings erected thereon by Fields. I would give only the legal interest, not 7 per cent., because that amount was not even authorised by the family council, and then the plaintiff recovers on the moneys disbursed for the defendant's benefit, and not on the obligation of the 8th January.\nAs to the hypothecation granted by the deed of 1880, it cannot stand even for the amount that the minor has benefited from the loan : Art. 1009 0.0. not in Code Napoleon. I refer for this to Duranton ([34]) ', Demolombe ([35]); Solon Nullit\u00e9s ([36]).\nL'hypoth\u00e8que constitu\u00e9e est nulle, lorsque les formalit\u00e9s requises n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9es, encore bien qu'elle ait en pour cause un emprunt qui a tourn\u00e9 an proftt du mineur; en cc cas, le pr\u00eat\u00eaur n'a qu'une simple action personelle; le mineur n'est point tenu en vertu d'un contrat, mais, ex lege, en vertu 1u principe d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 qui ne permtt \u00e0 personne de s'enrichir aux depens d'autrui([37]).\nSee also re Beauquis ([38]).\nThe reporter's summary of the case of Beliveau v. Duchesneau ([39])is misleading. The court there did not hold that a mortgage given by a minor is not radically null when the nullity is invoked by the minor or on his behalf.\nThe hypothecation being null it follows, of course, that the hypothecary action against Mary Louisa Kerr stands dismissed\nAs to the ratification by the defendant of this obligation of the 8th of Jan., 1880, by the deed of 23rd February, 1885, the plaintiff's contentions have been, in my opinion, rightly dismissed by the Superior Court. It was consented to by the defendant at a time when she was in complete ignorance of the circumstances under which the first obligation had been passed by her tutor, and at the instances and through the agency of the very man who had been her sub-tutor, and who thereby attempted to make her unwittingly ratify his own improper dealings in his own interest and those of his mother, the plaintiff, when acting for her, the defendant, under the guise of a friend and protector in the family council of 1879. A confirmation or ratification, either express or tacit, either under art. 1213 or under art. 1720, is not binding if the arty assenting to it was not aware of the causes of nullity or illegality of the first obligation. No one can be presumed to abandon voluntarily his rights. And no one can be held to have abandoned them when he did not know them. Sirey ([40]). \" Acquiesence and ratification must be founded on a full knowledge of the facts \" said their lordships of the Privy Council, in Banque Jacques Cartier v. Banque d'Epargnes ([41]), or, as the French courts put it in other words, l'intention \u00e9vidente de r\u00e9varer avec connaissance de cause le vice dont l'acte est atteint. And says B\u00e9darride ([42]) On ne peut renoncer \u00e0 un droit dont on n' a aucune connaissance.\nAs to the second item oftheplaintiffs'demand, $2,385.63, for so much acknowledged by the defendant to be by her due to the plaintiff by the deed of the 23rd Feb., 1885, apart from the first obligation, I think she is entitled to recover. The defendant was then of full age, and had been since 1881. This deed is expressed to be for valid consideration for advances made to her. On the defendant then was the burden of proving that the deed was false in this particular. She has entirely failed to do so. As to the contention that she consented to sign this deed only through fear and pressure, I am of opinion with the Superior Court, and Tessier and Boss\u00e9 JJ. in the Court of Appeal that she has not proved it. A plea of this nature, to destroy a solemn deed received by a public officer, cannot prevail but on the clearest evidence The only witnesses on the point are the defendant herself, whose testimony must be read out of the record her sister who is herself a defendant on an hypothecary action where the same deed of ratification is attacked by her on the same ground, and Mrs. Fields, their foster mother, whose evidence is so palpably biassed that it is not surprising that the learned judge before whom the evidence was taken did not rely on it.\nI would, on this item, restore the judgment of the Superior Court.\nAppeals of Davis v.

Remarks on an order granting such leave on appellant undertaking to ask no costs of appeal.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of Armour C.J. in favor of the plaintiff.\nThe appellant is assignee under an assignment for the general benefit of creditors, and the respondent an execution creditor, of one Kidd. The respondent\u2019s execution was placed in the sheriff\u2019s hands the day before the assignment was executed, and the sheriff seized the goods of Kidd but released them on being notified of the assignment. These proceedings were subsequently brought to determine the extent of the respondent\u2019s lien for costs under 48 Vic. ch. 26 s. 9, as amended by 49 Vic. ch. 25 s. 2, the respondent contending that the lien attaches to the full costs of suit and the appellant that it is limited to the costs pertaining to the issue of, and proceedings on, the writ of execution.\n48 Vic. ch. 26 s. 9 provides that \u201can assignment for the general benefit of creditors under this act shall take precedence of all judgments and of all executions not completely executed by payment.\u201d\n49 Vic. ch. 25 sec. 2 enacts as follows: \u201cSection 9 is amended by adding thereto the following words, \u2018subject to the lien, if any, of an execution creditor for his costs where there is but one execution in the sheriffs hands, or to the lien, if any, of the creditor for his costs who has the first execution in the sheriffs hands;\u201d and so amended the section is now sec. 9 of R.S.O. (1887) c. 124.\nThe case was argued before Armour C.J., who gave judgment for the plaintiff (respondent) thus deciding that the lien attached to the full costs of suit. His judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Burton dissenting. The defendant then appealed to this court.\nFor Q.C. for the appellant. Prior to the amending act an execution creditor had no lien for either debt or costs; Porteous v. Myers[2]. Then the amendment gave him the costs of execution so that his diligence would not place him in a worse position than other judgment creditors. This was all the legislature had in view and the act should be construed in the light of that intention. Hawkins v. Gathercole[3]; Caledonian Railway Co. v. The North British Raihvay Co.[4]; Thomas v. The Great Western Railway Co.[5].\nAylesworth for the respondent cited Allan v. The Great Western Railway Co.[6]; Scott v. The Great Western Railway Co.[7]\n(In the course of the argument the Chief Justice called attention to an order published in the record and purporting to be made by the Court of Appeal which gave defendant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court he undertaking to ask no costs of such appeal.\nHis Lordship said: \u201cThe Court of Appeal was not justified in making this order and had no right to insert any undertaking as to costs which is a matter entirely in the discretion of this court.\nMr. Foy referred to the Ontario statute requiring leave to appeal when the amount in controversy is under $1,000.\nHIS LORDSHIP.\u2014We have repeatedly stated in this court that we are not bound by that statute. The effect of this order is that the waiver of costs is a condition of the appeal. There was no necessity for an application for leave to appeal and if such leave were granted it should not be tramelled with conditions.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The matter has been discussed in the Court of Appeal and there being no reported decision that the Ontario Act is ultra vires it has been acted upon.\nHIS LORDSHIP.\u2014The matter has been before this court more than once, appeals from Ontario being objected to on the ground that leave has not been granted under the Ontario Act, and it has been stated most unequivocally that this court is not bound by the act. If it is, then each province could legislate so as to take away the jurisdiction of this court altogether In one case where the Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal this court granted it on that ground alone[8]. And in a subsequent case, where it was sought to raise the question again, we refused to hear it because it had been decided already. No person practising in Ontario, who has anything to do with this court, can be ignorant of our position in regard to that statute. I do not wish it to be imagined that we have the slightest doubt as to our jurisdiction without regard to that act, for to hold so would be to disturb numerous decisions of the court.)\nFoy Q.C. in reply.\nSIR W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The facts of the case are thus stated in the judgment of Chief Justice Armour:\nIt was admitted by the pleadings that the plaintiff, on the 15th December, 1887, recovered judgment for debt and costs against one Kidd; that on the same day he placed writs against goods and lands in the hands of the proper sheriff, and that on the same day the said sheriff seized sufficient goods of the said Kidd to satisfy the said debt and costs. It was also admitted that on the 16th day of December, 1887, the said Kidd made an assignment to the defendant for the benefit of his creditors, under the provisions of the act R.S.O. cap. 124, of all his real and personal estate. It was also admitted by the defendant that the plaintiff was entitled to be paid in full the costs of the writ of execution against goods and the sheriff\u2019s proper expenses in connection therewith, but it was denied by him that the plaintiff was entitled to be paid in full any other part of his costs.\nThe act 48 Vic. cap. 26 sec. 9, gave an assignment for the general benefit of creditors under that act precedence of all judgments and of all executions not completely executed by payment.\nThis section was amended by section 2 of the act 49 Vic. cap. 25, by adding thereto the words: \u201cSubject to the lien, if any, of an execution creditor for his costs where there is but one execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands, or to the lien, if any, of the creditor who has the first execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands,\u201d and so amended this section stands as section 9, R.S.O. cap. 124.\nI agree with the learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division and the majority of the Court of Appeal that the words used therein \u201cfor his costs\u201d mean for his whole costs of recovering judgment, issuing execution, and of the sheriff\u2019s fees thereon, and are not to be limited, as was contended, to the costs of the writ of execution against goods and the sheriff\u2019s proper expenses in connection therewith.\nI can see no ambiguity in the language used by the legislature which must be read in its plain, ordinary, grammatical meaning and so read it can, in my opinion, only mean all the costs recoverable by the creditor from the debtor under the execution. I can discover nothing in the act to limit the term costs to the costs of the execution to the exclusion of the costs in the cause.\nI can discover nothing to induce me to suppose that the legislature used the language of the enactment in any other than its ordinary, natural sense. The fact of the legislators having shown that they well understood the difference between costs in the cause and costs on the execution so far from limiting the nature of the costs exempted, assuming we should go out of the statute to discover its construction the propriety of which I very much doubt, to my mind is strongly confirmative of the contention that where it used the word \u201ccosts\u201d without any such limit it intended that word to be understood in its fair and full meaning, without limitation or application to one description of costs rather than the other, but intended it to apply alike and without distinction to all costs. I therefore think the appeal should be dismissed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given in the judgments in the Court of Appeal. TASCHEKEAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In an action brought by the respondent against one Kidd, a question of account therein was referred to Daniel Home Lizars, Esquire, local master at Stratford, under the authority, it must, I think, be presumed for it is not so stated on the appeal book, of sec. 189 of ch. 50 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario of 1887 and the Judicature Act of 1881; before the 21st November 1885 the said local master made his report or certificate whereby he found that there was due from Kidd to the above respondent, the plaintiff in the said action, the sum of $522, and he directed that the defendant Kidd should pay to the said plaintiff his costs of the said action. These costs upon the 5th of September, 1887, were taxed at the sum of $795.55. No judgment was ever entered in the said action upon the said master\u2019s report or certificate, as required by the Ontario Judicature Act of 1881, order 37, p. 281 of McLellan\u2019s Judicature Act of 1881, but subsequently to the taxation of the said costs Kidd, the defendant in that action, paid to the plaintiff therein, the now respondent, upon the said sum of $522.00 and interest thereon and the said costs, the sum of $900.00 leaving the sum of $498.50 due in respect of the said action. Upon the 15th day of December, 1887, the local registrar at Stratford entered a judgment in favor of the now respondent against the said Kidd, not upon the said local master\u2019s report or certificate for the amount found due in the action the question of account wherein was referred to him and the taxed costs of the said action, but, upon what authority does not appear, for the said sum of $498.50, stating it in the judgment roll to be for balance of costs. In the absence of any authority suggested for the insertion of this statement in the judg- ment, the question now is whether that statement so made in the judgment roll can make the said sum of $498.50 for which the judgment was entered to be costs within the meaning of the Ontario statute 49 Vic. ch. 25 sec. 9; for upon the 16th day of December, 1887, the day after the entering of the said judgment and the issue of execution thereon, the judgment debtor Kidd made to the above appellant, as assignee, a general assignment for the benefit of his creditors under the provisions of the Ontario statute 48 Vic. ch. 26 as amended by said 49 Tic. ch. 25, and the respondent now claims, against the assignee of that assignment, to be a privileged creditor of the assignor for the amount of the above judgment debt and the costs of two executions issued thereon against the goods and lands of the judgment debtor, sheriff\u2019s percentage and other fees.\nAt the time of the passing of 48 Vic. ch. 26, upon writs of execution being placed in a sheriff\u2019s hands, the judgment debtor\u2019s goods and land became liable to the satisfaction of the judgment debt, and the judgment debtor could make no valid disposition thereof to the prejudice of the judgment creditor, but the latter acquired no \u201clien\u201d upon his judgment debtor\u2019s goods or lands. He acquired simply the right of having his judgment paid out of the judgment debtor\u2019s property, and of preventing the judgment debtor making a valid disposition of any part unless he should leave sufficient to satisfy the judgment debt. Now the statute in its 9th section enacted that an assignment for the general benefit of creditors under that act should take precedence of all judgments and of all executions not completely executed by payment; the effect of this section was to deprive a judgment creditor of all right of precedence in payment of his judgment debt as to so much of the debt as remained unpaid or unrealised by execution executed; and to give precedence to the assignment for the general benefit of creditors over all judgments, even though executions issued thereon should be in the sheriffs hands to be executed.\nThis 9th section of 48 Vic. ch. 26, was amended by 49 Vic. ch. 25 sec. 2, and so amended thereafter read and reads:\u2014\nAn assignment for the general benefit of creditors under this act shall take precedence of all judgments and of all executions not completely executed by payment subject to the lien, if any, of an execution creditor for his costs where there is but one execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands, or to the lien, if any, of the creditor for his costs who has the first execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands.\nThis language, which has been introduced by way of amendment of what was clear and just, has made an alteration in the act which has occasioned some perplexity. In the provision of 48 Vic. ch. 26, there was apparent both sound reason and justice in putting all creditors of a person unable to pay his debts in full upon an equal footing as to participation in his estate assigned for the equal benefit of all. It is difficult to see why a judgment creditor, by putting an execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands a day or an hour before the execution of an assignment by the judgment debtor for the general benefit of all his creditors, and it may be for the express purpose of obtaining precedence over the assignment which the judgment creditor may have known was being prepared for execution, should obtain precedence for that portion of his judgment debt which consisted of costs; for this is the extent to which the respondent\u2019s contention must go if it prevails. So, likewise, is it difficult to perceive why, where there are several executions in the sheriffs hands against the same debtor, that privilege of precedence for costs over an assignment for the general benefit of all the judgment debtor\u2019s creditors should be granted to him who had his execution first in the sheriffs hands. No rational explanation for this preference being made in favor of the first of several execution creditors, has been or, as it seems to me, can be suggested. Then what can be the meaning of the words twice used in this amended section \u201csubject to the lien if any,\u201d of an execution creditor, or of the first of several, for his costs?\nIt is only with execution creditors whose executions are in the sheriff\u2019s hands that the section deals at all. To an execution creditor who has not yet placed his writ of execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands when the assignment for the general benefit of creditors was executed the section gives no preference. The placing of a writ of execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands did not, as already observed, give to the judgment creditor a lien upon any goods or lands of the judgment debtor. The section does not purport to create a lien which before did not exist; it simply enacts that the assignment for the general benefit of creditors immediately upon its execution shall have precedence over all judgments and all executions save only as regards any lien, if an execution creditor having an execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands has any lien, for his costs. If independently of the section the execution creditor had no such lien the section does not give him one. There is a difficulty in construing the section as treating the right, which a judgment creditor acquired by placing a writ of execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands, of preventing the judgment debtor making any valid disposition of his property unless he should leave sufficient to satisfy the judgment debt as constituting a lien upon such judgment debtor\u2019s goods or lands, for in that case as ex-pramissis the placing the writ of execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands would effectually perfect the lien, the qualification involved in the words, \u201cif any\u201d twice deliberately used in the section would be quite insen- sible. There is, as it appears to me, much force in the view taken by Mr. Justice Burton in the Court of Appeal for Ontario, namely, that the costs referred to are costs of an execution creditor in relation to his writ of execution, that is to say, costs incurred subsequently to the writ of execution being placed in the sheriff\u2019s hands, for which costs a lien may have been obtained by a levy made under the execution, as, for example, for the sheriff\u2019s possession money\u2014the taking care of and feeding cattle\u2014mileage\u2014and all other the sheriff\u2019s fees and expenses of execution, and such poundage as the sheriff might be entitled to under the 45th section of ch. 66 of the R.S.O., 1877; for such costs, if any have been incurred by actual seizure, it may with propriety be said that a \u201clien\u201d would be acquired upon the property levied upon, and a sensible construction to the section would be given by construing it as giving precedence to the assignment for the general benefit of creditors over all judgments and over all executions, subject only to the lien, if any has been acquired, for such costs by reason of an actual seizure having taken place; such costs would be actually costs of the \u201cexecution creditor,\u201d which is the term used in the section; and this construction would seem also to afford some explanation of the provision that the precedence of the assignment should be subject only to the costs of the creditor whose execution is first placed in the sheriff\u2019s hands, when there are more than one in his hands against the same judgment debtor, for it would be under the first writ placed in the sheriff\u2019s hands that most of the above costs would be incurred. But the section cannot, in my opinion, apply to the amount recovered by the judgment in the suit of Ryan v. Kidd even though we must construe the word \u201ccosts\u201d as used in the section as applying to the judgment cre- ditor\u2019s \u201ccosts\u201d included in his judgment. The term \u201ccosts\u201d as used in the section in such case must needs, in my opinion, be held to apply to the costs recovered by the plaintiff as incident to the debt or damages recovered by the judgment\u2014those costs which under the old form of entering judgment for a plaintiff it was adjudged that the plaintiff should recover \u201cfor his costs of suit by the court here adjudged of increase to the plaintiff which said monies, or debt, or damages and costs in the whole amount to .\u201d The form of entry of judgment is changed by the Judicature Act of 1881 but the substance still remains, and at No. 159 on p. 144 of McLellan\u2019s Judicature Act of 1881 the form of entry of judgment in a case similar to that of Ryan v. Kidd is given as follows:\nThe questions of account in this action having been referred to and he having found that there is due from the defendant to the plaintiff the sum of $ and directed that the defendant do pay the costs of this action. It is this day adjudged that the plaintiff recover against the said defendant $ and costs to be taxed.\nThe above costs have been taxed and allowed at $ as appears by a taxing officer\u2019s certificate dated the day of .\nNow assuming the term \u201ccosts\u201d in the 2nd section of 49 Vic. ch. 25 to apply to a plaintiff\u2019s costs recovered by a judgment entered in the above form, and not merely to his costs as execution creditor incurred subsequently to his writ of execution being placed in the sheriff\u2019s hands, it is to costs which, as in the above form, are recovered by a plaintiff as his taxed costs incidental to the recovery of a judgment by him for a debt or damages that the term must in my opinion be construed as applying. There are no such costs recovered by the judgment in Ryan v. Kidd now under consideration. The only sum recovered by that judgment as a judgment debt is the sum of $498.50; no costs are recovered as incidental to the recovery of that judg- ment debt. What appears by the judgment is that on the 5th September 1887 there was due from the defendant to the plaintiff the sum of $1,317.55 with interest upon the sum of $522 from the 28th November, 1885, and that on the 15th December, 1887, there remained due in respect of such debt the sum of $498.50 for which sum as his only judgment debt the plaintiff entered judgment, adding without any apparent authority for so doing, \u201cfor balance of costs herein.\u201d There does not appear to have been any warrant for the insertion of these words, the sole object of doing which would seem to have been to lay a foundation for the contention in the present case; neither does their insertion alter, in my opinion, the fact apparent from what is previously stated in the judgment showing that the amount for which the judgment was entered was in truth a balance of a larger sum alleged to have been previously due from the defendant to the plaintiff for debt, interest and costs, for which as a debt due to the plaintiff the judgment is entered. The insertion of these words in a judgment so entered cannot, in my opinion, make the judgment for such debt to be a judgment for \u201ccosts\u201d within the meaning of that term as used in 49 Vic. ch. 25 sec. 2, nor anything else than an ordinary judgment for a debt antecedently due as distinct from a judgment for taxed costs recovered by a judgment as incidental to the recovery of a debt or damages recovered by the same judgment, which I take to be the true construction of the term \u201ccosts\u201d as used in 49 Vic. ch. 25 sec. 2.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the appeal should be allowed with costs because, first, I think that the term as used in the above section refers to an execution creditor\u2019s costs of his writ after it is placed in the sheriff\u2019s hands and in respect of which something had been done giving rise to a lien for the costs \u201cif any\u201d so incurred; secondly, because assuming the term to be applicable to \u201ctaxed costs\u201d of suit recovered in a judgment whereby a debt or damages is or are recovered, and not to be limited to an execution creditor\u2019s costs incurred in virtue of same action taken by a sheriff under a writ of execution placed in his hands, the judgment debt recovered in Ryan vs. Kidd cannot, in my opinion, be said to be for \u201ccosts\u201d within the meaning of that word as used in 49 Vic. ch. 25 sec. 2; and thirdly, because to whatever the term \u201ccosts\u201d as used in the section may be applicable, I am of opinion that no \u201clien\u201d attaches in favor of an execution creditor upon any property of his judgment debtor until a levy or seizure should be made by the sheriff, under an execution placed in his hands to be executed, of some property of the judgment debtor to which the \u201clien\u201d can attach, and as there has been no such seizure made under the execution placed in the sheriff\u2019s hands at the suit of Ryan vs. Kidd, there has been no \u201clien\u201d acquired by Ryan for any costs to which the precedence of the assignment for the general benefit of Kidd\u2019s creditors is by the statute made \u201csubject.\u201d\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The judgment of Ryan v. Kidd for $498.50 must, I think, be considered to be a judgment for costs taxed in that action. It sets out the reference of the question of account in the action, and the award that there was due from the defendant to the plaintiff $522, and that the defendant was to pay the costs of the action; that the costs were taxed at $795.55; that $900 had been paid upon the judgment debt and interest and in reduction of costs, leaving $498.50 due in respect of the action: and adjudges to the plaintiff the sum of $498.50, being for balance of costs therein. The form of this entry may be open to criticism, but I take it that we must accept and act on the judgment as we find it.\nThe question that presents more difficulty to my mind is the proper effect to be given to the enactment R.S.O. (1887) ch. 124 section 9.\nUpon the best consideration I have been able to give to the matter, I have come to the conclusion that the view taken by Mr. Justice Burton, who dissented in the court below, and by my brother Gwynne in the judgment just delivered by him, is the correct understanding of the section.\nThe language of the enactment is satisfied, as I construe it, by giving to the execution creditor the costs incident to his execution when by seizure under it he may have obtained what is called a lien for those costs. That construction is, in my judgment, better fitted to the language employed than the construction which would give him also the taxed costs included in his judgment, which are expressly given in other circumstances by the Creditors\u2019 Relief Act to the creditor under whose writ the sale takes place for the benefit of all the creditors, while there is no reason, upon any ground of principle apparent to my apprehension, why a preference in respect of the taxed costs should be given to the creditor who happens to have put his fi. fa. in the sheriff\u2019s hands before the assignment for the general benefit of creditors. For these reasons, as more fully detailed by my brother Gwynne, and in the court below by Mr. Justice Burton, I am of opinion that we should allow the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Foy & Kelly.\nSolicitors for respondent: Idington & Palmer.\n[1] 16 Ont.

It is, therefore, no ground of objection to a winding\u2011up order that the security to be given by the liquidator appointed thereby is not fixed by the order, but is left to be settled by a master.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing an appeal from the judgment of Boyd C.[2] who made an order for winding up the Union Fire Insurance Company, under the Dominion Winding-up Act.\nOn a former appeal to this court[3] a winding-up order made by Mr. Justice Proudfoot in this matter was held defective and remitted to the court below for the petition to wind up the Union Fire Insurance Co., to be dealt with anew. The matter was then brought before the Chancellor, who made an order containing, among others, the following provisions: \u201c1. This court doth declare that the said the Union Fire Insurance Company is an insurance company within the provisions of the said act, and is insolvent under the provisions thereof, and doth order that the business of the said company shall be wound up by this court under the provisions of the said act and the amendments thereto.\u201d\n\u201c2. And this court doth further order that William Badenach, of the city of Toronto, accountant, the receiver heretofore appointed in the said case of Clarke v. Union Fire Insurance Company, be and he is appointed permanent liquidator to the estate and effects of the said company upon his furnishing security to the satisfaction of the master in ordinary of the Supreme Court of judicature for Ontario before he shall intermeddle with the said estate.\u201d\n\u201c3. And this court doth further order that it be referred to the said master in ordinary to fix the remuneration payable to the said liquidator, to settle the list of contributories, take the accounts of the assets, debts and liabilities and all other necessary accounts, and to make all necessary inquiries and reports and do all necessary acts and give all necessary sanctions to the said liquidator for the winding up of the affairs of the said company under the provisions of the said act and amendments thereto.\u201d\nShoolbred, a shareholder of the insolvent company, objected to this order on the grounds, mainly, that the Dominion Winding-up Act was not applicable to a company incorporated by the Ontario Legislature, and, therefore, no order could be made under it in this case; also that if the order could be made it was defective in leaving the security of the liquidator to be settled by the master, as the court could not so delegate the authority conferred on it by the act. Both these objections were overruled by the Court of appeal and the order was confirmed. Shoolbred then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nS.H. Blake Q.C. and McLean for the appellant referred to Merchant\u2019s Bank of Halifax v. Gillespie[4].\nBain Q.C. for the respondents cited Re Eldorado Union Store Company[5] and the cases relied on in the courts below.\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014In this case the majority of the court are of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. I should have liked more time to consider the matter, but my opinion could not affect the decision and I am not prepared to dissent from the judgment of the court.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I agree that the appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I entertain no doubt that the Winding-Up Act of the Dominion Parliament, 45 Vic. ch 23, and the acts in amendment thereof, do apply to the Union Fire Insurance Company, and that so applying those acts are intra vires of the Dominion Parliament, and I confess that I cannot understand how it can be doubted that this court was of that opinion when it made the order which was made upon the former appeal between the same parties. It cannot be conceived that after hearing an argument upon this very ground of appeal upon the former occasion, this court would have remitted the case to be dealt with by the court below, under the provisions of the statute, in accordance with the opinion of the majority of the court as to the construc- tion of the statute, if they were of opinion that the act did not apply to the Union Fire Insurance Company.\nI still am of opinion that proceedings instituted by certain creditors of that company for the purpose of having the proceedings taken by the respondent Clarke to have the assets of the company applied in liquidation of the claims of its creditors brought under the operation of the Dominion statute, 45 Vic. ch. 23, as amended by 47 Vic. ch. 39, were well instituted under the provisions of the 2nd and 3rd sections of the latter act, and I entertain no doubt that the order of the learned Chancellor for Ontario, which is the subject of this appeal, was a good and valid order under these acts as the same are amended by and consolidated in ch. 129 of the Revised Statutes of Canada.\nThe intention of Parliament in submitting all proceedings instituted for the winding up of insolvent companies under these acts to the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts in the respective Provinces of the Dominion was to leave those proceedings or cases to be dealt with in those courts by the machinery and course of procedure ordinarily in use in those courts in consimili casu, and in my opinion this intention was made sufficiently apparent by sec. 77 of ch. 129 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, and the repeal of the sub-section of that section and the substitution therefor of another sub-section by 52 Vic. ch. 32 sec. 20, does not, in my judgment, create any doubt whatever as to such having been the true construction of the said sec. 77 of ch. 129.\nThe objections taken to the form of the learned Chancellor\u2019s order appear to me to be of a purely technical character, affecting only matter of procedure, matters which are not, in my opinion, proper subjects of appeal to this court. To speak of a reference to a master of a matter which, according to the ordinary procedure of the court, comes within his ordinary duty as a delegation by a judge to a master to do what it was the duty of the judge himself to do, involves, in my judgment, a misuse of the term, a misconception of the intention of Parliament, and a misconstruction of the terms of the act in which that intention is expressed. I concur in the dismissal of the appeal with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The Union Fire Insurance Company was incorporated in 1876 by an act of the Legislature of Ontario, 39 Vic. ch. 93.\nIn November, 1881, the company was insolvent, and its license from the Ontario Government, under R.S.O. (1877,) chap. 160, was suspended.\nIn the same month of November, 1881, Clarke, one of the present respondents, instituted an action in the High Court of Justice in Ontario, asking on behalf of himself as a creditor of the company and on behalf of the other creditors to have the assets of the company realised and distributed. His position will more fully appear from the following extract from his statement of claim:\u2014\n10. By the said act of incorporation a capital stock was provided for, of which a large amount was subscribed for, taken and is now held by a large number of persons, and a portion thereof has been paid up, and the holders of the said stock are too numerous to be made parties defendants, and it would be almost impossible for the plaintiff to proceed with this cause and the expense attending the same would be very great were he compelled to make all the shareholders parties in this action, and in order to realize the amount due to the plaintiff and other creditors from the various stockholders of the said company, it would be necessary to bring a great number of actions, whereas the amount due to the plaintiff and other creditors can be realized herein with less expense and in less time.\n11. The plaintiff claims that under the circumstances it would be greatly to the advantage of the creditors of the defendants generally to have the company wound up, and the assets administered under the direction of this court, and that he and the creditors of the defendants generally cannot be sufficiently protected in their rights without the benefit and assistance of this court.\n12. The defendants have, pursuant to the statute in that behalf, deposited with the treasurer of the Province of Ontario the sum of $26,300, which deposit the plaintiff claims should be made available by order of administration on unearned premiums and on claims by the policy holders in the said company in accordance with the terms of the said statute, and notice of the failure of the said company to pay said claims after the lapse of sixty days from time it became due has been given by the plaintiff to the said Provincial Treasurer.\n13. The plaintiff claims to have it declared that the defendants are liable to have their deposit in the hands of the Provincial Treasurer administered in manner provided for in the 21st and 22nd sections of said chapter 160.\n14. The plaintiff claims to have it declared that the plaintiff and the other creditors of the company are entitled to have the assets of the company realized to pay its creditors.\n15. The plaintiff claims that an account may be taken of what is due to the plaintiff and the other creditors of the said company, and that the assets may be applied in payment of the claims of the said creditors in due course of administration, and that all the unpaid stock and other assets may be called in.\n16. The plaintiff further claims that a proper person may be continued as receiver of the property, business and moneys of the said company, with power to collect and get in all the assets of the said company, and to manage and wind up its affairs, and that proper direction may be given to the said receiver.\n17. The plaintiff further claims that the said company, its officers, servants and agents, may be restrained by the order of this court from intermeddling in the management of the property of the said company and from receiving any of the moneys or profits thereof.\nJudgment was, by consent, entered in that action for the plaintiff on the seventh of January, 1882, giving the full relief asked, and referring it to the master to take an account of the debts and liabilities of the company, to fix the priorities of the creditors, and to take an account of the assets and estate of the company. After a report by the master there was another judgment on further directions which referred it again to the master to continue the accounts and to ascertain and settle who were the stockholders of the company, and order- ed the company to make calls for enough to pay the debts.\nThe master entered upon the inquiries, and contests on various matters took place before him, but he made no report.\nThe reason for this was that proceedings were initiated under the Dominion Winding-up Acts.\nThose proceedings have led to the present appeal, which is from the judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming a winding-up order made by the Chancellor of Ontario on the 9th May, 1888.\nThat order was made six years and a-half after the institution of Clark\u2019s action, and it was upwards of eight years from the commencement of the action when this appeal was argued.\nThere had been a former winding-up order made in January, 1885, from which the present appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal of Ontario[6], where the court being equally divided in opinion the appeal was dismissed, but upon a further appeal to this court the order was vacated and the matter remitted to the High Court[7].\nI shall presently notice the ground of that decision. In the meantime I may quote an observation made with equal force and truth by one of the learned judges while expressing his opinion that upon one ground, which he designated as a purely technical and unmeritorious objection, the order ought to be reversed.\n\u201cThe only practical result of the objection,\u201d remarked Mr. Justice Osler, \u201cseems to be that the winding up of this insolvent company has been delayed for more than a year. The delay and expense which have been already incurred are a reproach to the administration of justice, the litigation having been pending for nearly five years, with the result, as we understand, that between $5,000 and $6,000 of the company\u2019s assets have been expended in costs.\u201d\nThe reproach to the administration of justice is now more glaring, for four years more have elapsed and, save as advanced by the recent hearing of this appeal, the litigation is at precisely the same stage, the former order having been replaced by that of the Chancellor, but with an inevitably large addition to the costs.\nThe Chancellor\u2019s order was made under the Winding-up Act, R.S.C., ch. 129, which came into force on the first of March, 1887. The first order was under 45 Vic. ch. 23, as amended by 47 Vic. ch. 39. In the revised statute, section 20 represents the former section 24, but with the important substitution of the word \u201cmay\u201d for \u201cmust,\u201d thus removing the ground on which it was contended that the liquidator must be appointed by the winding-up order, which was the main question on which the judges of appeal differed in opinion. This question, whether the order to wind up the business of the company and the appointment of the liquidator must be written on one paper, or might be written on two, was justly characterised by the learned judges who felt compelled to hold that the section imperatively required the two things to be embraced in the one order, as a purely technical point.\nThat first winding-up order did not appoint a liquidator, but referred it to the master to appoint one, merely continuing, as liquidator ad interim, the same gentleman who was already acting as receiver. No one supposed or contended that a permanent liquidator could be appointed under section 24, either by the winding-up order or by a subsequent order, without the prescribed statutory notice being given to creditors, &c. The objection taken to the order was because it failed to appoint a liquidator, yet, singularly enough, the case seems to have been presented on the appeal to this court, as would appear from the head note of the report and from some of the judgments delivered, as if the liquidator had been appointed by the order and (as would have been so in that case) without due notice of the intention to appoint him. The objection to the absence of the notice, upon the case thus apprehended, was a substantial objection, and was not the technical and unmeritorious one which arose and was dealt with upon the facts as they really existed, and it was upon that apprehension of the case by the majority of the judges that the order was vacated.\nThe decision cannot give much assistance in settling the disputed construction of the section. The questions now raised are not quite the same as those made under the former order, and some questions raised upon the enactment, under section 24, are excluded by the change made in section 20 of the revised statute.\nThere are two branches to the present appeal.\nFirst, it is contended that the Dominion Winding-up Act does not apply to the Union Fire Insurance Company because that company was incorporated by Provincial and not Dominion legislation; and then, assuming the act to apply to the company, it is objected that its provisions do not authorise the order made by the Chancellor.\nThe interpretation clause of the act, R.S.C. ch. 129, defines the expression \u201cinsurance company\u201d as used in the act, as meaning a company carrying on, either as a mutual or a stock company, the business of insurance whether life, fire, marine, ocean or inland marine, accident, guarantee or otherwise; and defines the expression \u201cwinding-up order\u201d as meaning an order granted by the court under that act to wind up the business of the company, including any order granted by the court to bring within the provisions of the act any company in liquidation or in process of being wound up.\nSection 3 declares that the act applies to certain incorporated companies, including incorporated insurance companies, wheresoever incorporated, and\n(a) Which are insolvent; or\n(b) Which are in liquidation or in process of being wound up, and on petition by any of their shareholders or creditors, assignees or liquidators ask to be brought under the provisions of the act.\nNo language could be more general and comprehensive or less calculated to suggest the exclusion of any class of incorporated companies, nor has any good reason been given for thinking such exclusion can have been intended.\nThe Provincial Legislatures have under section 92 of the B.N.A. Act exclusive power to make laws in relation to the incorporation of companies with provincial objects; but the body politic created by any such act of incorporation becomes, like a natural body, subject to the laws of the land. There are a number of the subjects over which exclusive legislative jurisdiction is given to the Parliament of Canada, as well as others in relation to which the Parliament may make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, the legislation on which must govern all corporate bodies as well as natural bodies; for example\u2014interest, legal tender, currency, taxation, the criminal law, and bankruptcy and insolvency.\nIn its compulsory operation upon incorporated companies the Winding-up Act is an insolvency law. Companies that are not insolvent, as well as those that are, may be brought under its operation by the effect of the second part of section 3 when they are already in liquidation or in process of being wound up. This may be on petition of creditors or assignees as well as of shareholders or liquidators; but original proceedings under the Winding-up Act can be instituted only by creditors and only when the company is insolvent.\nA wider power now exists under the Winding-up Amendment Act 1889, 52 Vic. ch. 32 (D). That act authorises voluntary winding-up proceedings at the instance of the company or a shareholder, following in this respect the 129th section of the English Companies Act, 1862, which is also followed by the Ontario Winding-up Act, R.S.O. (1887) ch. 183. But that provision for voluntary winding-up is not extended, like the winding-up act, to all corporations. It is confined by section 2 to companies incorporated \u201cby or under the authority of an act of the Parliament of Canada, or by or under the authority of any act of the late Province of Canada, or of the Provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island or British Columbia, and whose incorporation and the affairs whereof are subject to the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.\u201d\nThis obviously is intended to exclude companies incorporated by provincial legislation since confederation under the exclusive legislative jurisdiction given to the Provinces. Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba, are not named, and misapprehention as to the four provinces which have retained their anti-confederation names is shut out by the reference to the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada. Thus, the provision for voluntary winding-up is expressly confined to a class of corporations in which the Union Fire Insurance Company is not included, and the unlimited application of the Winding-up Act to the compulsory liquidation of the affairs of all insolvent corporations is made more clear.\nIt was argued that the third section of the act of 1889, which I have just quoted, went to show, by the omission of the name of the Province of Ontario, that the Winding-up Act did not apply to this Ontario company. This court may be said to have in effect decided that it did so apply when it remitted the matter to the High Court after the former appeal; and the leave to bring forward the present appeal was granted partly, if not principally, to give an opportunity to discuss the effect of the amendment act as a legislative explanation of the Winding-up Act.\nIt is clear that the act of 1889 bears on the question in no other way than to make the unlimited extent of the principal act more manifest.\nIt is, it is true, to be read with and construed as forming part of the Winding-up Act; but that is by the introduction into the statute of a set of provisions for the voluntary winding up of a limited class of corporations, to which provisions the expressions in section 3 \u201cthis act applies,\u201d &c, must be referred. The section does not qualify or supersede section 3 of the principal act. The term \u201cthis act,\u201d means and will continue to mean the amendment act, and not the whole Winding-up Act.\nThere are, in this act of 1889, specific amendments of several sections of the Winding-up Act. Those sections as amended must continue to apply to the same companies as before, although the amendments are made by an act which is declared to apply to a more limited class of companies. There is, doubtless, a want of precision in this particular, but the act can be read according to its evident intent without violence even to the literal wording. There are no restrictive words in section 3, such as \u201cshall only apply,\u201d and yet the newly introduced powers touching voluntary liquidation will be confined to the class of companies specified in section 3 because, being newly created, they have only the extent expressly assigned to them. There is, in my opinion, no reasonable doubt that the Union Fire Insurance Company is subject to the provisions of the Winding-up Act.\nThen, is the Chancellor\u2019s order authorised by the act?\nThe order declares that the company is an insurance company within the provisions of the act, and is insolvent, and then proceeds to order:\n(1.) That the business of the company be wound up.\n(2.) That Wm. Badenach, the receiver appointed in the case of Clarke v. The Company, be permanent liquidator of the estate and effects of the company upon his furnishing security to the satisfaction of the master in ordinary before he shall intermeddle with the estate.\n(3.) That it be referred to the master to fix the remuneration payable to the liquidator, to settle the list of contributories, etc., etc.\n(4.) That costs of petition, &c., be paid by the liquidator out of the assets of the estate.\n(5.) That costs ordered to be paid to plaintiff and defendants in Clarke\u2019s case, but not paid, be paid out of the assets.\n(6.) That accounts, &c., in Clarke\u2019s case stand and be incorporated with and used in the winding-up proceedings, so far as applicable.\n(7.) That parties who contested their liability in Clarke\u2019s case to be settled on list of shareholders shall be at liberty to apply to the court after the settlement of the list of contributories for the payment of such costs in Clarke\u2019s case as they may deem themselves entitled to.\nWe may simplify the consideration of the objections taken to this order by satisfying ourselves of the nature of the jurisdiction conferred on the court by the Winding-up Act.\nThe starting proposition, to the overlooking of which I attribute much if not all of the difficulty that to some judges has seemed to attend the working of the act, is that by the B.N.A. Act the constitution and organization of provincial courts, both of civil and criminal jurisdiction, and including procedure in civil matters in those courts, is a function of the Provincial Legislature.\nThere is no a priori presumption that the Parliament of Canada in passing an act upon a subject within its exclusive jurisdiction intends to encroach upon the exclusive jurisdiction of the Province. If an act is ambiguous in this particular, I take it that the construction to be preferred is that which accords with the declaration of our constitutional charter.\nAmong the subjects exclusively assigned by section 91 to the Parliament of Canada are interest, bills of exchange and promissory notes, and bankruptcy and insolvency. We should be surprised to find that Parliament assuming to enact that an action on a bill of exchange should always be tried by a judge without a jury, or tried at bar before the full court, or that interest on a promissory note must always be computed by the judge personally and not by a master or referee.\nWe should be equally unprepared to find it enacted that when a provincial court was administering an insolvency or bankruptcy act the functions and powers of its officers were to be different from those exercised in an administration action or other action within its ordinary jurisdiction.\nSuch an enactment would amount to the constitution and organization of the court by the Dominion Parliament and not by the Local Legislature.\nYet this is what I understand to be contended is the intention and effect of the Winding-up Act.\nIn my opinion the act was never so intended, but, on the contrary, the effort of the Parliament has been to leave the court to perform its functions by means of its ordinary machinery and by its ordinary procedure.\nI may refer, without repeating what I said, to the opinions on this topic which I expressed at some length in the Court of Appeal when the appeal from the first winding-up order in this matter was heard[8].\nI then alluded to amendments of the statute which seemed to me to be dictated by the desire to make it perfectly clear that the ordinary procedure of the court and the ordinary functions of its officers under the regular constitution and organization of the court, were not intended to be interfered with.\nSection 77 of the Revised Statute seemed and still seems to me sufficiently plain on this point. But questions still arose. A reference to the master was considered to be an unauthorised delegation of duties which the statute assigned to the court, and not, as in ordinary cases, the discharge of its functions by the court by its accustomed methods. That opinion found expression in the present litigation, and has, as I venture to think, contributed towards the protracting of the litigation. The term \u201cdelegation\u201d is, to my apprehension, inaccurately used in this position. It has, however, been accepted by the legislature which has again interposed to disclaim the intention imputed to it. The Winding-up Amendment Act, 1889, repeals the second sub-section of section 77 and substitutes the following:\u2014\n2. After a winding-up order is made the court may, from time to time, by order of reference, refer and delegate, according to the practice and procedure of such court, to any officer of the court any of the powers conferred upon the court by this act or any act amending the same as to such court may seem meet, subject to an appeal according to the practice of the court in like cases.\nThe repealed sub-section was, as I understand it, quite as explicit as this, but it was confined to Ontario while this is general.\nBut the amendment act does not stop here. It goes on to declare in terms that:\u2014[9].\nThe proceedings under a winding-up order shall be carried on as nearly as may be in the same manner as an ordinary suit, action or proceeding within the jurisdiction of the court.\nOne objection to the order is that the approval of the security to be given by the liquidator and the fixing of his remuneration are referred to the master. Section 24 enacts that \u201cthe court may also determine what security shall be given by the liquidator on his appointment;\u201d and section 28 that \u201cthe liquidator shall be paid such salary or remuneration, by way of percentage or otherwise, as the court directs, upon such notice to the creditors, contributories, shareholders or members as the court orders.\u201d\nThe objection is without foundation. The reference is an accordance with the ordinary procedure of the court, and the action of the master, which is always subject to appeal and revision, is the action of the court. This topic has been dealt with in the court below by Mr. Justice Osler to whose remarks it is not necessary to add anything.\nThe incorporation of the proceedings in Clarke\u2019s action was fully discussed in the Court of Appeal under the first winding-up order. I refer to my remarks as reported on that occasion[10].\nThe position described in section 3 (b) is that of this company. It was in liquidation or in process of being wound up in the action of Clarke. That action and the proceedings taken in it are set out in the petition on which both the winding-up orders were made. That petition, by two creditors of the company, asked in substance that the company should be brought under the provisions of the Winding-up Act. Clarke\u2019s action, it will be remembered, was commenced in November, 1881, and judgment was entered in it in January, 1882. The company was, therefore, in liquidation or in process of being wound up on the 17th of May, 1882, which was the date of the passing of the Winding-up Act, 45 Vic. ch. 23.\nSection 14 of the revised statute declares that:\nAny shareholder, creditor, assignee, receiver or liquidator of any company which was in liquidation or in process of being wound up on the 16th of May, 1882, may apply by petition to the court asking that the company may be brought within and under the provisions of this act, and the court may make such order; and the winding-up of such company shall thereafter be carried on under this act:\n(2.) The court in making such order may direct that the assignee, receiver or liquidator of such company, if one has been appointed, shall become the liquidator of the company under this act, or may appoint some other person to be liquidator of the company.\nThis must mean that in the cases, of which the present is one, to which the section applies the proceedings are to be taken up in the stage at which they are at the date of the order, and continued from that point under the Winding-up Act.\nIt was perhaps unnecessary to insert the directions in the order. They would have been supplied by the statute. They serve, however, to show that the order was made in view of this provision, and not merely because the company was insolvent.\nSection 20 forbids the appointment of a liquidator unless a previous notice is given to the creditors, contributories, shareholders or members in the manner and form prescribed by the court.\nIt is objected that this order of the 9th of May, 1885, was made without such notice.\nNow, setting aside the question whether the notice is required when a receiver appointed under pending proceedings is continued as liquidator under section 14, the short answer to the objection is that it is not supported by any proof of the asserted fact.\nNotice was duly given, as appears from the materials before us, for the appointment of a liquidator on the 20th of September, 1887, in pursuance of an order made on the 6th of that month. On the 20th an order was made that the matter of the petition and of the appointment should stand over till the 27th of the same month. How it came to stand further until the 9th of May is not explained. The Chancellor was doubtless satisfied that the proceeding had been properly continued or that due notice had been given. There is no reason to assume, nor is it suggested as a fact, that it was not so.\nIn my opinion the appeal fails on every ground, and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Walker & McLean.\nSolicitors for respondents, petitioners: Bain, Laidlaw & Co.\nSolicitors for respondents, creditors: Foster, Clarke & Bowes.\nSolicitor for Union Fire Insurance Co.: G.F.

J. Ritchie C.J. and Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nStatute of frauds\u2014Contract relating to interest in land\u2014Part performance.\nB., a resident of British Columbia, wrote to his sister, in England, that he would like one of her children to come out to him, and in a second letter he said \" I want to get some relation here for what property I have, in case of sudden death, would be eat up by outsiders and my relations would get nothing.\" On hearing the contents of these letters T., a son of B.'s sister and a coal miner in England, came to British Columbia and lived with B. for six years. All that time he worked on B.'s farm and received a share of the profits. After that he went to work in a coal mine in Idaho. While there he received a letter from B. containing the following : \" I want you to come at once as I am very bad. I really do not know if I shall get over it or not, and you had better hurry up and come to me at once, for I want you and I dare say you will guess the reason why. If anything should happen to me you are the person who should be here.\" On receipt of this letter T. immediately started for the farm but B. had died and was buried before he reached it. After his return he received the following telegram which had not reached him before he left for home : \" Come at once if you wish to see me alive, property is yours, answer immediately. (Sgd) B.\" Under these circumstances T. claimed the farm and stock of B. and brought suit for specific performance of an alleged agreement by B. that the same should belong to him at B.'s death.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that as there was no agreement in writing for the transfer of the property to T., and the facts shown were not sufficient to constitute a part performance of such agreement, the fourth section of the statute of frauds was not complied with, and no performance of the contract could be decreed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia affirming the judgment at the trial which refused a decree for specific performance.\nIn addition to the facts stated in the above head-note it appeared that after the death of Bridges the defendant Prevost was appointed administrator to his estate by the court and, by leave of the court, sold a portion of the real estate to one Power who is a defendant in the suit, and a part of the relief claimed is that the sale may be declared void and the administrator required to repay the purchase money to Power. This was refused but the plaintiff was held entitled to compensation which was fixed at the amount received for the land and the net proceeds of the sale of the stock and farm implements, but out of this sum the plaintiff was to pay the costs of Power and the administrator. The full court varied this judgment by ordering that the plaintiff should pay these costs generally and that he should receive a sum equal to the value of the cattle on the lands sold, a new trial to be had if the parties could not agree upon such value.\nFrom the judgment of the full court the plaintiff, Thomas Turner, and his mother, Alice Turner, one of the defendants, appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nS. H. Blake Q.C. for the appellants cited Alderson v. Maddison[1] ; Studds v. Watson[2] ; Re Maddever[3] ; McDonald v. McKinnon[4] ; Magee v. Kane[5] .\nMoss Q.C. for the respondent, Prevost, referred to Caton v. Caton[6] ; Campbell v. McKerricher[7] ; Ridgway v. Wharton[8].\nMcCarthy Q. C., and A. F. McIntyre appeared for the respondent Power, citing Finch v. Finch[9]; Shaw v. Crawford[10] ; Price v. Salusbury[11] ; Hope v. Hope[12] ; Gervais v. Edwards[13].\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014As regards the real estate, or the proceeds thereof sought to be recovered in this action, I think the court below was right in holding that the alleged agreement cannot be enforced by reason of the non-compliance with the statute of frauds, there being in this case no writing signed by the party to be charged or his agent, as required by the statute in actions on an agreement concerning lands, nor is the case taken out of the statute by evidence of part performance. As regards so much of the decree as touches the value of the stock and implements on the farm at the death of the intestate, as it has not been appealed against it will stand.\nFOURNIER J. concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Apart from the judgments in Alderson v. Maddison in the Court of Appeal[14] and in the House of Lords[15], I should have been of opinion that the present is not at all a case for the application of the doctrine of part performance taking a case out of the operation of the 4th section of the Statute of Frauds ; but in view of the above judgments in Alderson v. Maddison[16] it is impossible, without utterly disregarding those judgments, to apply that doctrine to the present case. The arguments on behalf of the plaintiff are based upon the same fallacy as that which Lord Justice Baggallay, in giving judgment in Humphreys v. Green[17], pronounced the arguments on behalf of the plaintiff in that case to rest, namely, that they relied upon the parol agreement itself to prove that the alleged acts of part performance were referable to that agreement, and I must add that there seems to have been much in the conduct of the plaintiff wholly inconsistent with the particular parol agreement, which he now insists upon, ever having been made. That the plaintiff had reasonable expectation of some benefit from his uncle's will cannot, I think, be doubted and his disappointment, no doubt, has been great, but to hold that he is entitled, upon the equitable doctrine of part performance, to the very benefit which he insists upon would be to extend that doctrine beyond what is warranted by the decided cases upon which the doctrine rests. While we may sympathise with the plaintiff in his disappointment we cannot strain the law beyond its legitimate limits for his benefit. We may, however, I think, while dismissing his appeal do so, under the circumstances, without costs, as was done in Alderson v. Maddison[18] and direct the costs of the administrator, Prevost, to be paid out of the estate of the intestate. I think, also, that so much of the order of the court below as, in the event of the parties differing upon the \" sum to be paid as the value of the cattle and increase,\" directs a new trial to be had, and all that is in the order subsequent to that direction, should be expunged from the order and that, in lieu thereof, it should be directed that it should be referred to an officer of the court to take evidence as to such value and to report thereon to the court in the ordinary manner.\nPATTERSON J. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant Thomas Turner: Theodore Davie.\nSolicitor for appellant Alice Turner: Gordon E.

Ritchie C.J. and Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nTrustees\u2014Commission to\u2014Rule of law.\nIn the Province of Nova Scotia prior to the passing of 51 V. c. 11 s. 69 the rule of English law relating to commission to trustees was in force, and no such commission could be allowed unless provided by the trust.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favor of the defendant.\nThe only question raised in this case is: Has a trustee under a will in the Province of Nova Scotia a right to a commission on the funds of the estate for his services when no provision is made therefor in the will?\nThe court below, affirming the decision of the trial judge, held that the English practice refusing such commission is not in force in Nova Scotia, and gave judgment for the defendant who claimed a commission as such a trustee. The plaintiff, an executor and legatee under the will, appealed from that decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nThe appellant in person. The rule in England refusing such a commission as is claimed in this case is well established; Robinson v. Pett[2]; Williams on Executors[3]; Lewin on Trusts[4]; Barrett v. Hartley[5].\nIn all the cases cited in the judgments delivered in the court below, as forming exceptions to the general rule, the circumstances were peculiar and they cannot be regarded as shaking the rule.\nIn none of the cases cited from the East Indies was a commission allowed to trustees, though it was allowed to executors. The West India cases were all decided under a local act.\nThen in the absence of any legislative provision governing it in Nova Scotia this case must be decided under the rule of the Chancery Court in England.\nThe application of English law to these colonies has been dealt with in Uniacke v. Dickson[6]; Doe d. Anderson v. Todd[7]; Kerr v. Burns[8]; see also Kelly v. Jones[9]; Deedes v. Graham[10].\nIt is contended that the practice has always been to allow these commissions but the law cannot be changed by a mere practice; Hamilton v. Baker[11]. Moreover the practice has not been proved. See Freeman v. Fairlie[12].\nBefore the passing of the present statute in Ontario these commissions were not allowed; Wilson v. Proudfoot[13]; Deedes v. Graham[14]. And the same has been held in the State of New York; Green v. Winter[15]; Manning v. Manning[16].\nExecutors and trustees do not stand in the same position in respect to commissions and an executor is not a trustee until he passes his accounts; Perry on Trusts[17]; Walker on Executors[18]; Conkey v. Dickinson[19]; Miller v. Congdon[20]; Prior v. Talbot[21].\nThe will provided a sum as compensation to the trustees and if it was not considered sufficient the defendant should have refused to accept the trust. By accepting it he does so subject to all the provisions of the instrument creating it and the law governing the same.\nHenry Q.C. for the respondent. There are numerous exceptions to the English rule; Brown v. Litton[22]; Forster v. Riddley[23]; and the court in England has made a distinction in respect to the colonies, assigning as a reason that it would be difficult to get suitable persons to act as trustees without compensation. See Chambers v. Goldwin[24]; Denton v. Davy[25]; Chetham v. Lord Audley[26].\nThe case of Uniacke v. Dickson[27] is a leading case in Nova Scotia and lays down a rule for the application of English law to the colonies: See also Collins v. Story[28]; Caldwell v. Kinsman[29].\nThe English rule has been held inapplicable in Massachusetts; Barrell v. Joy[30]; Gibson's Case[31].\nThe allowance in the will was to the executors and had no relation to the trusts created. See Ex parte Dover[32]; Dix v. Burford[33].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Weatherbee that the principle of the law of England that trustees were not allowed for their services when remuneration was not expressly provided for, but that the same should be gratuitous, is clearly established by the authorities, and I think the same principle is as applicable to Nova Scotia as to England, and as there does not appear to be any legislative authority or judicial decision to the contrary it must be held to be the law of Nova Scotia until the same shall be changed by the legislature. The legislature appears, prior to this case, to have dealt with the office of both executors and trustees and to have allowed a commission for his services to the former but only the costs and expenses to the latter; this is a strong confirmation of what the law was, and an equally strong intimation that the legislature did not intend to alter it; that having changed the policy of the law in respect to executors the legislature left the case of trustees untouched until 51 Vic. ch. 11 sec. 69, passed in 1888, where compensation was for the first time provided for trustees, and the provision was made applicable to trusts constituted or created either before or after the commencement of the act but not to affect any suit or other legal proceeding pending at the time of its commencement. It is difficult to conceive how the legislature could more clearly have expressed its intention to change the law in relation to the remuneration to trustees.\nUnder these circumstances I am clearly of opinion that this appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversed, and the judgment of Mr. Justice Ritchie set aside and judgment entered for the appellant for the amount claimed with costs of the trial and of both appeals.\nFOURNIER J. concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and judgment entered for the plaintiff for the reasons given by Weatherbee and Townshend JJ. in the court below.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In my opinion it is apparent upon the will of the testator that the devise of the $700 given to each of the executors therein named for his services was intended to be given to them, and if the trusts of the will should be accepted it was to be taken by them, in full compensation for all the duties of every description imposed upon them by the will in the execution of the trust purposes thereof, including that of paying over to the appellant the whole of the income to arise from the sum directed by the will to be invested for his benefit. The defendant, in my opinion, can make no claim for any sum beyond the seven hundred dollars which it is admitted he has received. This appeal, therefore, should be allowed with costs, and judgment be ordered to be entered in the court below in favor of the plaintiff for the full amount claimed by him, with costs of suit.\nPATTERSON J. concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: C.

J. Ritchie C. J. and Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nDemolition of dam\u2014Transaction\u2014Arts. 1918, 1920 C.C.\u2014Report of expert\u2014Motion to hear further evidence.\u2014C. S. L. G. c. 51.\nThe plaintiff, a riparian proprietor brought an action against one L. to compel him to demolish a dam which L. had erected on the river Mille Isles, and to pay damages for injury caused by said dam. In this action judgment was rendered ordering the demolition of the dam and payment of damages. While this judgment was in appeal an agreement for settlement was arrived at between the parties by which it was agreed that the dam should be demolished by a certain day, failing which, the judgment for demolition should be carried out. The property was subsequently sold to the defendant who bought with the full knowledge of the agreement in question and agreed to be bound by said agreement and also by the judgment as if he had been a party thereto. The defendant, however, did not completely demolish the dam, but used a portion at one end and the foundation of it throughout for a new dam. The plaintiff then brought the present action against the defendant for the-demolition of this second dam and for damages. In this action the Superior Court, after hearing a number of witnesses, appointed as expert an engineer who reported that the dam caused no injury to plaintiff's property. This report the court gave effect to, refusing a motion made by plaintiff asking leave to examine the expert and other witnesses for the purpose of showing the incorrectness of the report and dismissed the action with costs on the ground that the defendant had only exercised the rights given him by c. 51 of the C. S. L. C, ([1]) and the plaintiff had suffered no damage.\nHeld:\u2014Per Fournier, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\u2014That c. 51 of the C. S. L. C had no application, the rights of the parties being regulated by the agreement for settlement arising out of the first action which was a ''transaction \" within the meaning of articles 1918 and 1920 of the Civil Code.\nPer Fournier and Gwynne JJ.\u2014On the whole evidence the plaintiff was entitled to judgment and the appeal should be allowed. Per Ritchie C. J. and Taschereau J.\u2014The appeal should be dismissed, but in any event all the plaintiff could ask was to have the case remitted to the court of first instance to take further evidence. which was the principal ground of his appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench as stated in his factum.\nPatterson J while of opinion the law and evidence would have warranted a judgment for the plaintiff concurred in the view that under the circumstances all the plaintiff could ask was to have the case remitted.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal side) ([2]) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court in favor of the defendant.\nThe plaintiff in his declaration alleged that he \"was proprietor of a lot of land situated on the river Mille Isles and one Limoges had in 1876, erected a mill and dam on the opposite side of the river which raised the water and caused it to flow back on plaintiff's land; that an action was brought to compel the removal of said dam, which action while pending in appeal was settled by the said Limoges undertaking its removal before a certain day, and agreeing to pay all costs; that the land on which the said mill and dam were erected was subsequently sold Lo the present defendant (respondent) who, so far from carrying out the undertaking of the former owner erected another dam on the said land; and this action was brought for the demolition of the last mentioned dam and damages.\nThe defendant alleged by his pleas that the former dam was removed and that the one erected by him caused no damage to plaintiff's land. After several witnesses had been heard, the Superior Court appointed one Emile Vannier civil engineer to ascertain the following facts viz:\n\"First, if the dam constructed by the defendant, when the water overflows the dam and the flood-gates are raised causes the water to flow back on the property of the plaintiff. \"Secondly, if the dam, with the flood-spates closed, has the effect to raise the level of the water opposite the property of the plaintiff, when the water is on a level with that of the dam.\n\"Thirdly, if the dam, when the flood-gates are closed, has the effect to raise the level of the water opposite the plaintiff's property when the water does not pass over the dam.\"\nUpon the production of Vannier's report the case was inscribed for evidence and argument, and the plaintiff made several motions, amongst others a motion to be allowed to examine the said Vannier to explain his report, and to examine witnesses and to give further evidence.\nThe court rejected the motions and, adopting the report of Vannier, gave judgment in favor of the defendant, which judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. The plaintiff then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nLaflamme Q.C. for the appellant contended that he could not be deprived of his right to examine Vannier on his report and that appellant was entitled to furnish and complete the evidence as to the incorrectness and errors of the expert's report; Dalloz Juris. Gen. ([3]); he also contended that he was entitled to have the first judgment and the compromise or \" transaction e entered into between the parties completely carried out by the total, and not by the partial, demolition of the dam, and that there was ample evidence of damage. Art. 1920 C.C.\nGeoffrion Q.C. and Beaudin fosr the respondent, in addition to supporting the judgment on the facts, submitted that the old dam being removed the damage, if any began anew on the construction of the second dam, and there were no damages when the action began. Sir W. J. RITCHIE C.J. and TASCHEREAU J. were of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed, but that in any case all the appellant could ask was to have the case remitted to the court of first instance to hear further evidence, which was the principal ground of his appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench as stated in his factum before this court.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014L'appelant a demand\u00e9 par son action la d\u00e9molition d'une chauss\u00e9e faisant refluer l'eau de la rivi\u00e8re des Mille-Isles, sur sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9.

les parties demanderesse de leur c\u00f4t\u00e9 s'obligeant de discontinuer sans autres d\u00e9pens leurs actions sons l'engagement formel du dit M\u00e9dore Labelle de d\u00e9molir et enlever la dite digue le premier septembre prochain, et, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par lui d'ex\u00e9cuter la convention, les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es \u00e0\u00bb la d\u00e9molition se r\u00e9servaient le recours en dommage pour l'avenir.\nLe m\u00eame jour 23 novembre 1879 le dit M\u00e9dore Labelle vendit au d\u00e9fendeur le terrain o\u00f9 \u00e9tait assis le dit moulin avec digue, terrain et accessoires, y compris le terrain situ\u00e9 dans la paroisse de Terrebonne sur lequel \u00e9tait appuy\u00e9e la digue en question, savoir la m\u00eame propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que celle qui avait fait le sujet du litige entre les demandeurs dans les diff\u00e9rentes causes contre le dit Joseph Limoges.\nCette vente fut faite sp\u00e9cialement aux conditions mentionn\u00e9es dans l'acte d'arrangement ci-haut relat\u00e9, particuli\u00e8rement l'obligation de d\u00e9molir la digue dans le d\u00e9lai stipul\u00e9, lequel accepta le jugement comme s'il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu contre lui les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, et notamment le demandeur, renon\u00e7ant aux dommages soufferts et ult\u00e9rieurs pourvu que l'acheteur, le d\u00e9fendeur, ne fit rien pour aggraver la position des parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es et d\u00e9molisse la digue en question.\nPar son action le demandeur all\u00e8gue: que le d\u00e9fendeur n'a pas rempli les conditions stipul\u00e9es au dit acte d'arrangement et n'a pas d\u00e9moli et enlev\u00e9 la digue, ainsi qu\u2019ils'y \u00e9tait oblige, mais, au contraire, a fait de nouveaux travaux dont l'effet est le m\u00eame que le maintien de la chauss\u00e9e en question et qui, de plus, aggrave la position du demandeur et des autres int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, et a ferm\u00e9 la dite digue et par l\u00e0 \u00e9lev\u00e9 le niveau de la rivi\u00e8re et continue \u00e0 faire subir au demandeur des dommages contre lesquels la transaction en question devait le sauvegarder, et obstrue le cours de l'eau dans le but d'\u00e9lever le niveau de la rivi\u00e8re au-dessus de tels travaux et a inond\u00e9 par l\u00e0 le terrain du demandeur et lui a caus\u00e9 des dommages consid\u00e9rables.\nQue le 3 mars 1881, le demandeur, avec plusieurs autres int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, savoir les parties \u00e0 l'acte d'arrangement du 23 novembre 1879, a somm\u00e9 et requis le d\u00e9fendeur par le minist\u00e8re de maitre Germain, notaire, de se conformer aux actes ci-haut relat\u00e9s et de d\u00e9molir la dite chauss\u00e9e dans les vingt jours apr\u00e8s la signification du prot\u00eat et de payer imm\u00e9diatement au demandeur la somme de cent piastres, montant des dommages par lui soufferts \u00e0 raison de la non-ex\u00e9cution du jugement et dit acte d'arrangement, ce \u00e0 quoi le d\u00e9fendeur s'est refus\u00e9.\nLe demandeur all\u00e8gue dans son action qu'il est fond\u00e9 \u00e0 demander la d\u00e9molition de la dite chauss\u00e9e ainsi construite par le dit Joseph Limoges ainsi que les travaux additionnels faits par le d\u00e9fendeur, et \u00e0 ce qu'il soit enjoint \u00e0 ce dernier de d\u00e9molir et enlever la dite chauss\u00e9e et les dits travaux et que d\u00e9fense lui soit faite de faire aucuns travaux additionnels dans la dite rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 l'endroit ci-haut mentionn\u00e9 et \u00e0 ce qu'il soit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 payer au demandeur la somme de $500.00, \u00e0 titre de dommages pour la non-ex\u00e9cution des dits actes d\u2019arrangements.\nLe demandeur concluait \u00e0 ce que la cour ordonn\u00e2t an d\u00e9fendeur de suspendre les travaux commences et de d\u00e9molir la chauss\u00e9e on toute obstruction par lui faite dans la dite riviere et de remettre les lieux dans l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 ils \u00e9taient avant la construction de la dite chaus\u00e9e et, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par lui de se conformer au jugement, que la cour ordonne que la chauss\u00e9e en question soit d\u00e9molie aux frais et d\u00e9pens du d\u00e9fendeur et qu'il soit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 payer au demandeur la dite somme de $500.00 de dommages. L\u2019intim\u00e9 plaida 1o qu'il avait enlev\u00e9 la chauss\u00e9e et fait dispara\u00eetre les obstructions qui avaient donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 l'action intent\u00e9e par Fabien Labelle contre Joseph Limoges; 2\u00b0 qu'il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de moulin construit sur la rivi\u00e8re des Mille-Isles et autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 utiliser l'eau de la dite rivi\u00e8re pour son moulin; 3o que la chauss\u00e9e mentionn\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9claration avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9molie, que les travaux qu'il avait fait faire n'avait pas l'effet d'\u00e9lever le niveau de l'eau ni de causer des dommages, puis une d\u00e9fense en fait.\nL'intim\u00e9 n'a aucunement attaqu\u00e9 la transaction qui est la base de l'action, mais il pr\u00e9tend que l'appelant n'a aucun droit de demander la d\u00e9molition de la dite chauss\u00e9e, que son seul recours serait en dommages, s'il en a souffert, et qu'avant de pouvoir l'exercer, il \u00e9tait tenu de faire constater ces dommages par expert.\nLes parties ont proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la preuve et fait entendre chacune huit t\u00e9moins. La cause ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise a l'hon. juge Rainville, celui-ci trouvant la preuve contradictoire ordonna une expertise \u00e0 l'effet suivant :\nQue les faits en contestation en cette cause soient constat\u00e9s par expert, lequel expert apr\u00e8s avoir v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 les mesurages faits par M. Beaudry ainsi que constat\u00e9s au plan fait par lui et produit en cette cause constatera les faits suivants :\u2014\n1. Si la digue, construite par le d\u00e9fendeur lorsque l'eau passe au-dessus de la digue et que les empellements sont soulev\u00e9s, a pour effet de faire refluer l'eau sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur.\n2. Si la dite digue, les empellements enlev\u00e9s, a l'effet de faire hausser le niveau de l'eau vis-\u00e0-vis la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur, lorsquc l'eau est juste \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 du haut dc la digue.\n3. Si la dite digue, lorsque les empellements sont mis, a l'effet de faire hausser le niveau de l'eau vis-\u00e0-vis la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur, lorsque l'eau ne passe pas au-dessus de la digue.\nIl est fort \u00e0 regretter que le r\u00e9sultat de ce co\u00fbteux expertise ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s nul. Mais la preuve de l'appelant avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 suffisamment \u00e9tabli les principaux faits dont il se plaint.\nIl est en preuve que le jugement ordonnant la demolition de la lere chauss\u00e9e, jugement que l'intim\u00e9 s'est engage par l'acte d' \"Arrangement\" du 23 novembre 1879, \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter, ne l'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9. Non seulement il reste une longueur de 27pieds de cette chauss\u00e9e qui n'apas \u00e9t\u00e9 touch\u00e9e, mais il est aussi en preuve par le t\u00e9moin Fabien Labelle que la digue n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 que partiellement d\u00e9molie.\nQ.\u2014Vous avez vu comment la derni\u00e8re digue a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, vous les avez vus travailler \u00e0 cette digue ? R.\u2014Oui, je l'ai toujours vu faire, ils l'ont toujours faite malgr\u00e9 nous.\nQ.\u2014Dites-nous ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait apr\u00e8s l'arrangement ? qu'est-ce que le propri\u00e9taire du moulin a fait par rapport \u00e0 la digue ? R.\u2014Il a d\u00e9boul\u00e9 le dessus except\u00e9 un bout d'\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s vingt-cinq pieds qu'il n'a pas d\u00e9moli; la nouvelle digue a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise apr\u00e8s le bout qui a rest\u00e9.\nQ.\u2014Ils out renvers\u00e9 une partie de la digue, mais la base est rest\u00e9e n'est-ce pas ? R.\u2014Oui, le fond a rest\u00e9.\nQ.\u2014Et vingt-cinq pieds de la digue \u00e0 partir d\u00fb moulin en allant dans la rivi\u00e8re sont rest\u00e9s ? E. Oui.\nQ.\u2014Ces vingt-cinq pieds de la digue sont demeur\u00e9s intacts, on n'en a d\u00e9moli aucune partie ? E. Non.\nLa d\u00e9molition de la digue a \u00e9t\u00e9 si imparfaite que le moulin a pu, malgr\u00e9 cela continuer \u00e0 marcher, ainsi qu'il est prouv\u00e9 par Ephrem Chapleau, t\u00e9moin de l'intime et locataire du moulin en question. Voir son t\u00e9moignage page 13 de l'appendice de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nR.\u2014Lorsque la dame a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9molie dans le mois de mars mil huit cent quatre-vingt-un, il a rest\u00e9 an certain vestige dans le fond de la rivi\u00e8re, ce vestige nous donnait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s douze \u00e0 quinze pouces de niveau qui nous restait, il y avait six ou sept pouces de niveau sur vingt, il reste onze \u00e0 douze pouces c'est avec ce niveau-l\u00e1 que nous avons pu fonctionner dans la crue des eaux par le remous qu'il v avait derri\u00e8re le moulin, et lorsque le remous a arr\u00eat\u00e9 nous avons arr\u00eat\u00e9.\nQ.\u2014De sorte qu'il restait donc dix-huit \u00e0 vingt pouces de niveau ? R.\u2014Non monsieur il rest\u00e2t do onze \u00e0 douze pouces comme j'ai dit et ceci nous a permis de marcher un peu \u00e0 la crue des eaux.\nQ.\u2014Sans cela, auriez-vous pu marcher ? R.\u2014Non, monsieur.\nQ.\u2014Il vous faut une digue ? R. Certainement.\nPuisqu'il restait une partie de cette digue suffisante pour faire marcher le moulin il est clair que la pr\u00e9tendue d\u00e9molition qui n'avait consist\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 faire d\u00e9bouler, comme le disent les t\u00e9moins la partie sup\u00e9rieure de la chauss\u00e9e, est une violation du jugement qui en avait ordonn\u00e9 la compl\u00e8te d\u00e9molition, aussi bien qu'une infraction \u00e0 l'acte de transaction auquel l'intim\u00e9 s'\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 par son contrat d'acquisition \u00e0 se soumettre et \u00e0 en remplir toutes les conditions.\nNon-seulement l\u2019intim\u00e9 s'est soustrait \u00e0 cette obligation de d\u00e9molir, mais il a de plus positivement viol\u00e9 les engagements qu'il avait pris par l'acte du 23 novembre 1879, en reconstruisant une autre chauss\u00e9e \u00e0 quelques pieds de distance de la premi\u00e8re avec cette diff\u00e9rence seulement que dans la seconde il a laiss\u00e9 des espaces ouverts de distance en distance de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 faire des empellements qu'il pourrait fermer ou laisser ouverts \u00e0 volont\u00e9. L'intim\u00e9 admet ces faits dans son propre t\u00e9moignage en ajoutant qu'il a reconstruit cette chauss\u00e9e d'apr\u00e8s l'avis de l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur Rielle, celui m\u00eame sur le t\u00e9moignage duquel la cour Sup\u00e9rieure avait principalement fond\u00e9 son jugement ordonnant la d\u00e9molition.\nCette reconstruction un peu modifi\u00e9e mais dans le fait produisant absolument les m\u00eames cons\u00e9quences que la premi\u00e8re n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9videmment faite que dans le but d'\u00e9luder l'ex\u00e9cution du jugement de d\u00e9molition et l'accomplissement des obligations du compromis. Elle forme une obstruction aussi consid\u00e9rable que la premi\u00e8re dont la d\u00e9molition n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9e que pour permettre le libre \u00e9coulement des eaux.\nA cet endroit la rivi\u00e8re des Mille-Isles n'offre dans la partie au-dessus de la digue, aucune pente perceptible, et \u00e0 l'endroit o le d\u00e9fendeur a construit son moulin il y a une l\u00e9g\u00e8re d\u00e9pression du lit de la rivi\u00e8re qui donne une diff\u00e9rence de niveau de vingt pouces sur une longueur d'environ cinquante pieds. La rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 cet endroit est r\u00e9tr\u00e9cie formant au-dessus un bassin o\u00f9 l'eau est plus profonde qu'\u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 s\u00ba trouve le rapide en question, lequel est cause principalement par un barrage naturel ou une cha\u00eene de rochers qui forme obstruction \u00e0 cet endroit \u00e0 l'\u00e9coulement naturel de l'eau mais n'offre r\u00e9ellement aucune chute d'eau suffisante pour l'alimentation d'un moulin ou usine sans en exhausser le niveau au moyen d'un barrage, comme l'a fait le d\u00e9fendeur, facile \u00e0 \u00e9riger \u00e0 cet endroit \u00e0 raison du peu de profondeur de l'eau et de l'\u00e9troitesse de la rivi\u00e8re dont la largeur \u00e0 cet endroit n'est que de 1400 pieds seulement.\nLa construction de cette chauss\u00e9e a n\u00e9cessairement pour cons\u00e9quence l'\u00e9l\u00e9vation du niveau de l'eau. C'est aussi le but que voulait atteindre l'intim\u00e9 par cette construction, afin de cr\u00e9er un pouvoir d'eau pour son moulin.\nLes t\u00e9moins de l'appelant ont compl\u00e8tement \u00e9tabli les diff\u00e9rences du niveau de l'eau apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9molition de la premi\u00e8re chauss\u00e9e et constat\u00e9 une si grande diff\u00e9rence, avec le niveau pendant l'existence de cette chauss\u00e9s, qu'ils ont pu cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0 cultiver leurs terrains bas, mais aussit\u00f4t la nouvelle chauss\u00e9e construite, l'eau a repris le niveau qu'elle avait lorsque la premi\u00e8re chauss\u00e9e existait.\nQuelques extraits de ces t\u00e9moignages suffisent pour constater ce fait d'une mani\u00e8re irr\u00e9futable.\nJanvier Hardy :\nQ. Je veux savoir quel effet cette digue avaitsur le niveau de l\u2019eau ? R. Je pense que la derni\u00e8re fait autant de dommage que la premi\u00e8re.\nQ. Je voudrais savoir quelle hauteur de niveau celle qu'il a d\u00e9molie donnait \u00e0 l'eau? R. L'autre \u00e9tait b\u00e2tie un peu plus bas, celle-ci, il dit qu'il l'a faite plus basse, mais il l'a b\u00e2tie sur le plus haut du galet; 1 je pense qu'elle nous fait autant de dommage pour le moins que la deuxi\u00e8me.\nQ. Avez-vous pris note quand ils ont d\u00e9moli la seconde digue de la diff\u00e9rence du niveau de l'eau ? R. \u00e7a. faisait gros de difference, je pense que \u00e7a faisait deux pieds pass\u00e9s de diff\u00e9rence.\nQ. Sur votre terrain ? R. Oui, et sur le terrain du demandeur aussi.\nTreffl\u00e9 Leonard, marchand et propri\u00e9taire de Ste.-Rose, aucunement int\u00e9ress\u00e9 dans ce proc\u00e8s dit:\u2014 Q. Veuillez dire si vous avez connaissance de la d\u00e9molition totale ou partielle de la digue en question et dans quel tat \u00e9tait votre propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avant et apr\u00e8s la construction de la nouvelle digue? R. Depuis deux ans j'ai \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la chose parce que la chose me concernait; ayant une terre \u00e0 cet endroit, j'ai d\u00fb prendre connaissance quel effet la digue pouvait avoir vis-\u00e0-vis de mon terrain. Alors j'ai constat\u00e9 quand la digue a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9molie en partie, \u00e7a eu pour effet de faire baisser l'eau, et quand ils ont construit la nouvelle digue \u00e7a eu pour effet de faire refouler l'eau sur ma propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Ensuite une chose que j'ai remarqu\u00e9 et qui m'a fait juger que c'\u00e9tait la digue qui faisait refouler l'eau, c'est qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas tomb\u00e9 une goutte d'eau, pas de pluie du tout.\nQ. Quand la nouvelle a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 construite 1 R. Dans le mois d'ao\u00fbt ou septembre 1881; l'\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s sec et j'ai fait une marque particuli\u00e8re avec mon homme. J'ai plant\u00e9 un b\u00e2ton sur le bord de l'eau. Un des hommes de M. Chapleau m'avait dit :\u2014Si tu veux marquer l'eau on va boucher la digue aujourd'hui.\n(Par la Cour.)\nQ. Quel est cc M. Chapleau ? R. C'est l'agent de M. Filiatrault, c'est lui qui g\u00e8re le moulin. J'ai fait cette marque dont j'ai parl\u00e9 tout \u00e0 l'heure et le lendemain je suis all voir avec mon homme et j'ai constat\u00e9 que l'eau avait refoul\u00e9 d'au moins un quart d'arpent sur ma propri\u00e9t\u00e9 basse.\nQ. Sur combien d'\u00e9paisseur \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s ? R. A peu pr\u00e8s six pouces ou un pied. J'ai mis le b\u00e2ton au bord de l'eau vis-\u00e0-vis de ma prairie basse pour voir combien de grandeur l'eau viendrait couvrir, parce que je savais que j'\u00e9tais pour avoir des difficult\u00e9s avec le d\u00e9fendeur. J'ai constat\u00e9 que l'eau avait couvert an moins un quart d. arpent de ma propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sur une \u00e9paisseur d'environ un pied. J'ignorais quel dommage la digue pouvait causer \u00e0 ma propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et c'est pour cela que j'ai voulu le constater; l'individu qui m'a vendu cette terre m'a dit qu'il n'aurait jamais vendu si la digue n'avait pas exist\u00e9. Alors j'ai achet\u00e9 cette terre parce que je savais qu'il y avait un acte de pass\u00e9e par lequel la digue devait \u00eatre d\u00e9molie. J'ai pris arrangement avec le d\u00e9fendeur par acte authentique, il devait me payer cent piastres de dommage par ann\u00e9e s'il ne d\u00e9faisait pas la digue.\nQ Vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 visiter la digue dans les terres, ce printemps ? R. Oui, j'ai trouv\u00e9 la digue compl\u00e8te, moins peut-\u00eatre deux plan\u00e7ons qui n'\u00e9taient pas dans une \u00e9chappe, \u00e0 pant cela elle \u00e9tait compl\u00e8te.\nQ. L'eau passait-il pardessus la digue 1 R. Oui, le trois avril lorsque j'y suis all\u00e9.\nQ. L'eau dans la rivi\u00e8re n'est-elle pas \u00e9tale ? R. Oui, tellement que lorsqu'il vente nord-est on met un madrier dans la rivi\u00e8re et il remonte, \u00e7a \u00e9t\u00e9 essay\u00e9 derni\u00e8rement au pont du chemin de fer \u00e0 Ste. Rose. Il n'y a presque pas de niveau. Q. Trouvez-vous qu'il puisse y avoir la moindre diff\u00e9rence pour l'\u00e9l\u00e9vation de l'eau caus\u00e9e par la digue qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9molie et celle qui existe maintenant ? R. Je ne trouve aucune diff\u00e9rence, la seule qui peut y avoir est que celle-ci est plus haute.\nQ. Il y a une pente sur le galet a cet endroit ? R. Oui la rivi\u00e8re baisse l\u00e0.\nQ. De sorte 1 que vous avez constat\u00e9 d'apr\u00e8s vos observations lue la digue se trouve a produire le m\u00eame effet, parce que ce quelle a perdu en hauteur de sa construction, elle l'a augment\u00e9 par l'\u00e9l\u00e9vation de sa base ? R. Oui.\nQ. L'ancienne ne barrait pas toute la rivi\u00e8re ? R. Non il y avait un chenal.\nQ. Aujourd'hui celle qui existe la barre compl\u00e8tement ? R. Oui, l'autre digue avait un chenal.\nCe t\u00e9moignage est corrobor\u00e9 par Mr. B\u00e9lair, propri\u00e9taire du pont de St. Rose, apr\u00e8s des faits v\u00e9rifi\u00e9s et par tons les autres t\u00e9moins du demandeur.\nMr. Beaudry, ing\u00e9nieur civil, a fait l'examen sp\u00e9cial des lieux et a constat\u00e9 les niveaux depuis le barrage jusqu'\u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur, a fait un plan qu'il produit (exhibit D) qui indique les diff\u00e9rents niveaux de la rivi\u00e8re au-dessus de la digue jusqu'\u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur ainsi que l'\u00e9l\u00e9vation de la digue et de l'eau \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9poques. La premi\u00e8re visite faite par lui, fut le 7 juin 1882.\nQ. A la premiere visite que vous avez faite (7 juin) l'eau d\u00e9versait-elle sur la digue ? R. Oui, il en d\u00e9versait pardessus la digue.\nQ. De combien l'eau d\u00e9passait-elle le niveau de la digue? avait environ quatre pieds et trois pouces d'eau qui passait pardessus la digue \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque le 7 de juin.\nQ. Et \u00e0 la seconde visite ? R. Le second jour que j'y suis all\u00e9, le 15 ao\u00fbt, je n'ai pas mesur\u00e9 la quantit\u00e9 d'eau qui passait pardessus la digue mais je sais que l'eau d\u00e9versait.\nQ. Dans la troisi\u00e8me occasion avez-vous visit\u00e9 la digue et de combien l'eau d\u00e9versait-elle ? R. Le dix-huit octobre\nQ. Oui, l'eau d\u00e9versait-elle pardessus la digue ? R. Oui, il passait \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s trois pouces d'eau pardessus le niveau de la digue.\nQ. A cette \u00e9poque-l\u00e0 quel \u00e9tait le niveau sur le terrain du demandeur ? R. Le niveau de l'eau en face do la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur \u00e9tait de 93 70\nQ. De sorte qu'il n'y avait de diff\u00e9rence de niveau entre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur et la digue que cinq centi\u00e8mes de pied ? R. Oui cinq centi\u00e8mes de pied, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s un demi-pouce. Q. C'\u00e9tait l\u00e0 toute la diff\u00e9rence entre le niveau de l'eau \u00e0 la digue et le niveau de l'eau vis-\u00e0-vis la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur 1 R. Oui entre la surface de la digue et le niveau de leau vis-\u00e0-vis la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur.\n(P. 43) Le t\u00e9moin n'a Pu constater le rapide.\nQ. Vous avez pris votre point de d\u00e9part \u00e0 quel endroit ? R. J'ai pris comme point de comparaison le plancher du moulin \u00e0 farine comme \u00e9tant le point 100, et toutes les c\u00f4tes indiqu\u00e9es sur le plan et la section sont en comparaison de cc point situ\u00e9 au. dessus d'une ligne imaginaire passant dans la terre.\nQ. Le plan indique la surface de l'eau aux \u00e9poques mentionn\u00e9es ? R. Oui. Q. Par les lignes bleues ? R. Oui.\nQ. Ce que je voudrais savoir, Mr. Beaudry, c'est ceci : lorsque vous avez visit\u00e9 les lieux le 18 octobre, l'eau passait pardessus la digue, n'est-ce pas ? R. Oui.\nQ. Maintenant que donnait le niveau de l'eau en face de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur, n'est-ce pas un demi-pouce au-dessus du niveau de l'eau \u00e0 la digue. R. Oui, c'est cela.\nQ. Dans les hautes eaux l'effet du barrage de la rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 cet endroit doit \u00eatre d'augmenter le volume de l'eau au-dessus de ce barrage, n'est-ce pas ? R. Naturellement.\nQ. Les \u00e9chappes maintenant laissent cent vingt-cinq pieds, n'est-ce pas, de libre cours d'eau ? R. Oui, je crois que c'est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s la largeur des \u00e9chappas.\nQ. Et la largeur de la rivi\u00e8re, n\u2019est-elle pas de quatorze cents pieds environ en bas de l'Ile ? R. Ca doit \u00eatre \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s cela.\nDe sorte que sur cent vingt-cent pieds de laiss\u00e9s libres \u00e0 l'eau pour s'\u00e9chapper, il faut que l'eau, qui se trouve r\u00e9pandue sur une largeur de quatorze cent pieds \u00e0 un endroit plus haut, se trouve \u00e0 passer dans ces \u00e9chappes de cent vingt-cinq pieds.\nM. Rielle, le seul ing\u00e9nieur ou arpenteur produit comme t\u00e9moin du d\u00e9fendeur, d\u00e9clare que les donn\u00e9es et les niveaux de M. Beaudry sont exacts\nAyant lui-m\u00eame avis\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9 dans la construction de cette nouvelle digue ce t\u00e9moin fait tout pour \u00e9viter de donner des r\u00e9ponses cat\u00e9goriques, mais il finit par admettre qu'il n'a constat\u00e9 lors de son premier rapport qu'une diff\u00e9rence de niveau entre la digue et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur de deux \u00e0 quatre pouces. Il constate \u00e9galement que toute la chute que pr\u00e9tend utiliser l'intim\u00e9 n'offre qu'une chute de huit pouces.\nDe sorte qu'il est constat\u00e9 tant par la preuve de l'appelant que celle de l'intim\u00e9 qu'il n'existe pas plus d'un demi-pouce de diff\u00e9rence entre le niveau de la digue et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant.\nMaintenant si on enl\u00e8ve la disque on baisse par cons\u00e9quent le niveau de toute la hauteur de la digue, soit quatre pieds moins les vingt pouces que le d\u00e9fendeur pr\u00e9tend exister de diff\u00e9rence de niveau entre le pied et la t\u00eate de ce qu'il veut appeler le rapide, ce qui donne par le fait de construction de la digue un exhaussement d'eau de deux pieds six pouces en face de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant\nEn transquestion on pose \u00e0 M. Beaudry la question suivante : \u2014\nQ. Avez-vous pris le niveau en question d'abord en mesurant la surface de l'eau en bas de la digue et la surface de l'eau en haut de la digue ? R. Je ne me rappelle pas directement si j'ai pris en haut on en bas en premier lieu; mais j'ai pris la surface de l'eau en bas de la digue aussi bien qu'en haut. Ensuite j'ai mesur\u00e9 la profondeur, je l'ai d\u00e9duite de l'\u00e9l\u00e9vation de la \u00a1surface et j'ai eu l'\u00e9l\u00e9vation du lit.\nQ. Appert-il \u00e0 votre plan on dans votre rapport on dans aucun autre mesurage de l'eau en has de la digue quel est le niveau en has de la digue ? K. Oui.\nQ. O\u00fb cela, veuiller l'indiquer ? R. Vous pouvez le voir par la seconde c\u00f4te en rouge \u00e0 la droite de la section produite en cette cause; cette c\u00f4te indique la surface de l'eau en bas le la digue le 18 octobre dernier (91.05.)\n(Par la cour.)\nQ. C\u2019\u00e9tait le niveau de l'eau en has de la digue ? R. Oui votre Honneur.\nQ. Quel \u00e9tait le niveau en haut de la digue ? R. Quatre-vingt-treize soixante-et-cinq (93.65).\nQ. Ca faisait une diff\u00e9rence de ? R. De deux soixante (2.60) ou deux pieds huit pouces.\nQ. Les \u00e9chappas \u00e9taient-elles ferm\u00e9es dans le temps ? R. Je crois qu'elles l'\u00e9taient.\nQ. Votre impression \u00e9tait qu'elles \u00e9taient ferm\u00e9es s R. Pour trois, oui, et une \u00e9tait un peu moins ferm\u00e9e que les autres. Il semble que ces t\u00e9moignages si positifs \u00e9tablissent les faits principaux de l'action, la d\u00e9molition partielle seulement de la premi\u00e8re chauss\u00e9e, et la reconstruction de la seconde qui \u00e9l\u00e8ve le niveau de l'eau autant que la premi\u00e8re, et qui n'est de fait que la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition du m\u00eame fait dommageable dont la cour avait ordonn\u00e9 la suppression. Ce que la cour avait \u00e0 d\u00e9cider, c'\u00e9tait seulement de savoir si le jugement, auquel s'\u00e9tait soumis l'intim\u00e9, et qu'il s'\u00e9tait engage par acte authentique \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter doit recevoir son ex\u00e9cution; et aussi la question de savoir si par la reconstruction de la deuxi\u00e8me chauss\u00e9e il n'a pas contrevenu au jugement et enfreint les obligations contract\u00e9es par l'acte d'arrangement du 23 novembre 1879. Ces deux questions ne doivent se r\u00e9soudre que par la lecture du jugement et par celle de l'acte d'arrangement dont il s'agit de faire application aux faits de la cause. C'est inutilement que l'on cherche \u00e0d\u00e9placer la question en invoquant le chapitre 51, des Statuts Ref. B.C. Cette cause ne peut donner lieu \u00e0 aucune question concernant l'interpr\u00e9tation de cc statut. L'action de l'appelant n'est bas\u00e9e que sur un jugement et une convention civile qui n'offre aucune difficult\u00e9 d interpr\u00e9tation, Elle ne peut \u00eatre jug\u00e9e que par les tribunaux ordinaires et non par le mode indiqu\u00e9 par le ch. 51, Stat. Ref. B.C. Si nous \u00e9tions appel\u00e9s \u00e0 faire l'application de ce chapitre, il est assez probable que nous adopterions l'opinion soutenue par plusieurs jugements, que le mode nouveau, indiqu\u00e9 par le ch. 51 n'exclut pas le recours aux tribunaux ordinaires, mais je ne crois pas que nous devions entrer dans l'examen de cette question, car les parties ont d\u00e9fini leurs droits respectifs par le contrat du 23 novembre 1879, \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution duquel elles sont tenues de se conformer.\nPar cet acte, auquel l'appelant et l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9taient parties contractantes avec plusieurs autres propri\u00e9taires riverains, le proc\u00e8s, encore pendant en appel au sujet de la premi\u00e8re digue, a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9 et termin\u00e9 par une transaction acceptant le jugement qui en avait ordonn\u00e9 la d\u00e9molition avec de plus une promesse de s'y conformer, tel que rapport\u00e9 plus haut. Quoique les parties aient d\u00e9sign\u00e9 leur acte sous le nom d' \" arrangement \" et que le mot \" transaction \" n'y soit pas employ\u00e9, cet acte n'en contient pas moins une v\u00e9ritable transaction \u00e0 laquelle on doit faire application des articles du Code Civil concernant les transactions\nEn effet cet acte a tous les caract\u00e8res de la transaction, il termine une contestation alors pendante en appel entre les parties, il contient des conventions pour en pr\u00e9venir le renouvellement, et les parties s'y font respectivement des concessions et des r\u00e9serves. Toutes ces conditions \u00e9tant de celles que caract\u00e9rise la transaction, il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire pour les parties de d\u00e9clarer plus formellement leur intention de transiger L'article 1918 d\u00e9finit ainsi la transaction :\nLa transaction est un contrat, par lequel les parties terminent un proc\u00e8s d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9, on pr\u00e9viennent une contestation \u00e0 na\u00eetre an moyen de concessions on de r\u00e9serves faites par l\u2019une des parties ou par les deux\nL'article 1920 en d\u00e9finit ainsi l'effet :\nLa transaction a entre les parties l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e en dernier ressort.\nArticle 1921 :\nL'erreur de droit n'est pas une cause de rescision\nLa transaction a comme on le voit tout \u00e0 la fois le caract\u00e8re et l'autorit\u00e9 d'une convention et la force d'un jugement. Il ne peut donc en cons\u00e9quence s'\u00e9lever aucune question, m\u00eame de droit, qui pourrait avoir l'effet d'attaquer la pr\u00e9sente transaction. Elle a l'effet d'un jugement en dernier ressort. C'est en vain que l'on voudrait soulever de nouveau une contestation au sujet des droits concernant l'exploitation des cours d'eau;les parties ont accept\u00e9e le jugement ordonnant la d\u00e9molition de la entass\u00e9e et se sont obliges \u00e0 ne plus rien zaire qui pourrait renouveler la cause des dommages dont l'appelant se plaignait. Il n'y a donc plus qu'une seule question, c'est d'ex\u00e9cuter le jugement et les conditions de la transaction qui out mis fin \u00e0 cette cause de contestation entre les parties et leurs ayants cause.\nLe motif pour lequel la cour Sup\u00e9rieure dont le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la cour du Banc de la Reine, a renvoy\u00e9 l'action de l'appelant est que \" le barrage du d\u00e9fendeur (deuxi\u00e8me chauss\u00e9e) ne peut causer de dommage dans les conditions o\u00f9 l'expert Vannier l'a trouv\u00e9 dans et lors de ces quatre visites sur les lieux \" C'est la conclusion du rapport de Vannier qui a servi de motif pour baser le jugement.\nLa mission de ce dernier n'\u00e9tait pas de donner ses appr\u00e9ciations des faits de la cause, mais de constater les faits pr\u00e9cis \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l'ordre d'expertise afin de combler quelque lacune dans le travail de l'ing\u00e9nieur Beaudry. Mais si volumineux et si savant en apparence que soit ce rapport, il n'a cependant jet\u00e9 que fort peu de lumi\u00e8re sur les faits \u00e0 constater Il n'a surtout pas \u00e9tabli le point principal qui \u00e9tait de constater si, lorsque l'eau d\u00e9vers\u00e9 sur la digue elle s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve d'autant sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant. Il s'exprime \u00e0 ce sujet de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\u2014\nJe dois dire \u00e0 l'honorable cour que le fait de fermer les vannes du barrage du d\u00e9fendeur aura pour effet de faire dispara\u00eetre le rapide sans que l'eau ne s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve chez le demandeur, lorsque l'eau affleurera seulement le niveau sup\u00e9rieur du barrage; mais que pour que l'\u00e9coulement n\u00e9cessaire des eaux de la rivi\u00e8re se produise, il faudra que le niveau des eaux s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve en amont et, par cons\u00e9quent, vis-\u00e0-vis la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur en cette cause.\nIl dit bien que le fait de fermer les vannes du barrage (chauss\u00e9e), aura pour effet de faire dispara\u00eetre le rapide sans que l'eau ne s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve chez l'appelant, lorsque l'eau affleurera seulement le niveau sup\u00e9rieur du barrage. Si le rapide dispara\u00eet lorsque l'ea\u00f9 atteint seulement le niveau sup\u00e9rieur du barrage, quel est l'effet qui se produirait sur ou vis-\u00e0-vis la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant, s'il passe 6 ou 12 pouces d'eau sur la chauss\u00e9e. Il aurait d\u00fb pousser ses investigations jusque l\u00e0, puisque la question qui lui eat soumise est de savoir Si lorsque l'eau passe au-dessus de la digue et que les empellements sont soulev\u00e9s, la digue a pour effet de faire refluer l'eau sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur. Mais non il s'arr\u00eate justement en de\u00e7\u00e0 du point principal \u00e0 \u00e9clair pour laisser \u00e0 deviner ce qu'il a voulu dire par la phrase suivante : \" Mais que pour que l'\u00e9coulement des eaux de la rivi\u00e8re se produise il faudra que le niveau des eaux s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve en amont et par cons\u00e9quent vis-\u00e0-vis la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur en cette cause.\" Si cela veut dire quelque chose, c'est une admission que l'eau dolt refluer sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant lorsque le niveau de l'eau d\u00e9passe l'affleurement de la digue. Vannier avait \u00e0 constater si l'eau s'\u00e9levait sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur, il n'en fait pas mention. De combien de pieds faudra-t-il que le niveau des eaux s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve pour que l'\u00e9coulement n\u00e9cessaire se produise ? Il n'en dit rien non plus. Cependant c'est un fait constat\u00e9 par les t\u00e9moins des deux parties que l'eau passe fr\u00e9quemment pardessus la digue, et que les empellements ne sont presque jamais ferm\u00e9s.\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fillion, t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9, dit que l'eau a toujours pass\u00e9 pardessus la digue, Fran\u00e7ois Desjardins en dit autant. L\u2019ing\u00e9nieur Beaudry a constate le m\u00eame fait dans les trois occasions o\u00f9 il a fait la visite des lieux. A sa premi\u00e8re visite le 7 juin, l'eau d\u00e9versait pardessus la digue de quatre pieds et trois pouces; \u00e0 sa deuxi\u00e8me, le 15 ao\u00fbt, il a vu que l'eau d\u00e9versait encore pardessus la digue, mais il n'en a pas constat\u00e9 l'\u00e9paisseur; \u00e0 sa troisi\u00e8me visite du 18 octobre, l'eau d\u00e9versait encore de trois pouces. Enfin il s'exprime comme suit au sujet de l'inondation de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant :\u2014 Q. Veuillez nous dire si le terrain du demandeur \u00e9tait inond\u00e9 \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque? R. La partie inond\u00e9e dans le mois de juin est montr\u00e9e \u00e0 l'extrait du plan par une couleur verte.\nQ. Quelle \u00e9tait la diff\u00e9rence de niveau entre la partie inond\u00e9 et le niveau de la digue ? R. Je viens de le dire, trois pieds et quatre pouces.\nQ. Pr\u00e9tendez-vous dire que le terrain qui \u00e9tait inond\u00e9e \u00e9tait de trois pieds plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que le niveau de la digue ? R. Oui.\nQ. De sorte que la digue ne pouvait, en aucune mani\u00e8re, causer le refluent des eaux sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur ? R. Au contraire, lorsqu'il passe quatre pieds d'eau pardessus la digue, ces quatre pieds d'eau se trouve refoul\u00e9s sur le propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur. Ca se trouve un pied audessus de cette partie o\u00f9 j'ai pris le niveau; mais il y a d'autres parties particuli\u00e8rement en allant vers le nord qui sont plus passes que celles o\u00f9 j'ai pris le coup de niveau.\nIl est aussi \u00e9tabli par Fabien Labelle et plusieurs autres t\u00e9moins que les vannes ne sont jamais lev\u00e9es et qu'il n'y a pas m\u00eame d'appareil pour les monter ou descendre. Puisqu'il est si bien prouv\u00e9 que l'eau passe pardessus la digue, pourquoi Vannier n'a-t-il pas essay\u00e9 de constater l'effet qui dolt n\u00e9cessairement se produire sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant lorsqu'il passe de six a douze pouces et m\u00eame audel\u00e0 de quatre pieds d'eau sur la chauss\u00e9e. Au lieu d'\u00e9tablir un fait aussi important il se borne \u00e0 dire d'une mani\u00e8re evasive \" que chaque fois que les empellements seront ferm\u00e9s, l'eau devra s'\u00e9lever en face de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant.\" Puisqu'il est prouv\u00e9 qu'ils sont toujours ferm\u00e9s, pourquoi n'a-t-il pas constat\u00e9 l'effet qui en r\u00e9sulte non seulement en face mais sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00eame de l'appelant\nMalgr\u00e9 son silence \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, l'effet de la digue sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant n'en est pas moins parfaitement constat\u00e9 par de nombreux t\u00e9moins qui, sans \u00eatre ing\u00e9nieurs civils n'en sont pas moins comp\u00e9tents pour \u00e9tablir les faits qu'ils rapportent. Fabien Labelle dit an sujet de la diff\u00e9rence du niveau de l'eau lorsqu'il n'y avait pas de digue, apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9molition de la premi\u0141re et la reconstruction de la deuxi\u00e8me: Il y avait bien du changement, en mil huit cent quatre-vingt-un (la digue \u00e9tait d\u00e9molie) nous avons cultiv\u00e9 nos terrains has comme avant qu'il y e\u00fbt une digue; mais aussit\u00f4t la nouvelle digue batie, nos terrains ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inond\u00e9s, comme en mil huit cent quatre-vingt-deux, nos terrains ont \u00e9t\u00e9 noy\u00e9s, nous n'avons pas Pu les cultiver.\nIl est positif \u00e0 dire que la derni\u00e8re digue cause les m\u00eames dommages que l'autre, d'apr\u00e8s lui, elle cause plus de dommages, le printemps dernier il a plus souffert qu'avec l'autre digue.\nQuant \u00e0 l'effet de l'eau refoul\u00e9e par la digue voir ce qu'il dit t\nQ. Avez-vous vu de l'eau autour des b\u00e2timents du demandeur le printemps dernier ? R. Oui.\nQ. Et pendant combien de temps le terrain est-il rest\u00e9 humide et impropre \u00e0 la culture ? R. Le terrain, sur toute la partie des quatorze on quinze arpents, est rest\u00e9 humide jusqu'au quinze de juillet.\nQ. Avez-vous jamais vu cela, dans aucune autre circonstance avant la digue? R. Non; l'eau venait sur le terrain du demandeur mais pas sur une aussi grande \u00e9tendue, pas plus de six ou sept arpents, \u00e0 la fin de mal l'eau s'en allait, \u00e7a ne faisait pas de dommage.\nQ. Quel est l'effet de ce s\u00e9jour de l'eau par rappoit \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur, pendant ce temps-l\u00e0, jusqu'au mois de juillet? R. Ca fait du dommage, \u00e7a rend la terre impropre \u00e0 la culture.\nQ. Quelle \u00e9tait la valeur de ce terrain inond\u00e9, par rapport an reste de la terre, avant la digue? R. C'\u00e9tait le terrain qui avait la plus grande valeur de la terre, parce que l'eau s'en allait vite pour cultiver ce ter-rain la terre ne s\u00e9chait pas trop et on avait du loin en abondance\nQ. Combien croyez-vous que le s\u00e9jour de l'eau cause de dommage \u00e0 la terre du demandeur, par ann\u00e9e ? combien de dommage, par arpent, pensez-vous ? R. Toujours, an plus has, cinq piastres par arpent; s'il ne retirait rien du tout de ces terrains \u00e7a vaudrait plus que cela.\nQ. L'\u00e9t\u00e9 dernier, vous dites que l'eau n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 haute ? R. Le printemps dernier, la grande rivi\u00e8re n'a pas monte comme de coutume.\nQ. Veuillez dire la hauteur, \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s, que l'eau avait \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 se trouve la digue, l'eau passait-elle pardessus les plan\u00e7ons ? R. Elle passait pardessus la digue.,\nLe t\u00e9moin Labelle (Fabien) n'est pas le seul \u00e0 constater des dommages positifs sur une partie de la terre de l'appelant Janvier Hardy dit que la meilleure partie de sa terre, qu'il appelle le c\u0153ur de sa terre, est endommag\u00e9e.

Chapter 51 of the C.S. of L.C. has, in my opinion, no bearing upon the question in issue in the present case; we are not, therefore, called upon to put a construction upon that act. The question which we have to determine appears to me, to be, whether the new work constructed by the defendant in substitution for the old dam adjudged to be and agreed to be removed, is a fulfilment of the contract of transaction entered into by the defendant in order to give effect to the judgment of demolition thereof in the former suit; and the evidence, to my mind, clearly establishes that the substituted work is retained to such a height that when the gates are closed it does and must cause waters of the river to flow back upon and to flood the plaintiffs land equally as did the former dam which was adjudged to be demolished.\nThe expert, Mr. Vannier, has certainly presented, to the court a very expensive, and it may be a very able, report upon the cause and effect of eddies on running streams, but the essay which he has produced upon that subject has no reference to the point in issue, for it has never been suggested that the eddy which does exist in the river above the dam, which is complained of ever\u2014before the construction of the dam\u2014caused the waters of the river to flow back upon and to flood the plaintiff's lands as they have been flooded since the erection of the dam. Mr. Vannier's report is, unfortunately, almost wholly upon matter quite irrelevant to the question in issue, which simply is, as to the height of the dam relatively to the level of the river at the plaintiff's land, and the dam's capacity when the gates are closed to pen back the waters of the river; and upon this point Mr. Vannier\u2019s report, in answer to the 3rd question submitted to him by the Superior Court, confirms rather than displaces the evidence of all the other witnesses, which clearly establishes that the new work when the gates are closed has the same injurious effect upon the plaintiff's land as had the old dam which was adjudged to be demolished and, which the defendant has contracted with the plaintiff to demolish, at least so far as to make it incapable of penning back water upon his land to his prejudice. I am, therefore, of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment and to such a demolition of the dam or reduction of its height that it cannot by possibility cause the waters of the river at any time to flow back upon and flood the plaintiffs land and I concur that there is sufficient evidence before us to justify us not only in determining the rights of the plaintiff but also in awarding to him damages for the injury already sustained.\nThe jurisdiction of this court must be singularly defective if with all the evidence taken in this cause, we cannot adjudicate upon the real point in issue between the parties without remitting the case to the Superior Court for the cross-examination of the expert, Mr. Vannier, upon his report, when all that is relevant in it a majority of the court deem to be confirmatory of the evidence given on behalf of the plaintiff.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I agree with my brothers Fournier and Gwynne in the views of the law and evidence presented in the judgments which they have delivered. I should also agree in the conclusion to dispose of the action by a judgment for the plaintiff if it was clear to me that that judgment ought to have been given by the court below upon the appeal to that court. What was there asked at all events as the principal ground of appeal was to have the action sent back to the court of first instance for further evidence. I am satisfied that the plaintiff was entitled to that relief, and under the circumstances I am disposed to agree with those of my learned brothers who think that we should not assume to do more for the plaintiff.\nI agree, therefore, that the appeal be allowed with costs here and in the Queen's Bench, and the case sent back for further evidence.\nAppeal allowed with costs and case remitted to the Superior Court for further evidence in support of or against, the report of the expert, Emile Vannier.\nSolicitors for appellant: Loflamme, Madore & Cross.\nSolicitors for respondent: Loranger, Beaudin & Cardinal.\n[1] Now secs. 5535 and 5536 R.

Ritchie C.J., and Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COMMON PLEAS DIVISION OF THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE FOR ONTARIO.\nRailway Co.\u2014Negligence\u2014Accident to employee\u2014Performance of duty\u2014Contributory negligence.\nJ., a switch-tender of the C.S. Ry. Co., was obliged in the ordinary discharge of his duty to cross a track in the station yard to get to a switch and he walked along the ends of the ties which projected some sixteen inches beyond the rails. While doing so an engine came behind him and knocked him down with his arm under the wheels and it was cut off near the shoulder. On the trial of an action against the company in consequence of such injury the jury found that there was negligence in the management of the engine in not ringing the bell and in going faster than the law allowed. They also found that J. could not have avoided the accident by the exercise of reasonable care.\nHeld, that The Workmens' Compensation for Injuries Act of Ontario, 49 V. c. 28, applies to the C.S. Ry. Co., notwithstanding it has been brought under the operation of the Government Railways Act of the Dominion.\nHeld also, Gwynne and Patterson JJ. dissenting, that there was no such negligence on J's. part as would relieve the company from liability for the injury caused by improper conduct of their servants and the judgment of the court below sustaining a verdict for the plaintiff was right, therefore, and should be affirmed.\nAppeal by consent from a decision of the Common Pleas Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario, sustaining a verdict and for the plaintiff at the trial.\nJackson, the plaintiff in this case, was a switch tender in the employ of defendants, and the action was brought in consequence of injuries caused by an engine knocking him down when endeavoring to walk over the track to a switch in the performance of his duties. The accident, the facts of which are not disputed, are related by the plaintiff at the trial as follows:\u2014\nI was attending to my daily duties to switch engines from one track to another as was required; I was going to let in engine number 328, which was going east on the east bound main line, and I had about 100 yards to go to where I thought she wanted to get into. I was in the shanty cleaning lamps and came out of the shanty door and walked up the side of the west bound track on the outside of the rail; when I was just about four or five rails length from the shanty an engine came up behind me, a switch engine, without ringing the bell or warning me in any way, and struck me. A man by the name of Hugh McCourt halloed to me and I turned around in time for my feet to be knocked from me and I fell in front of the engine. It was the left hand, and I had no way to catch on, and I had to throw myself off; therefore my right hand went under the wheel and was taken off close to the shoulder\nCross-examination.\nQ. How far from the rails did you walk? A. On the end of the ties.\nQ. How far do the ties project beyond the rail? A. About fifteen or sixteen inches.\nQ. And you kept going on on the ends of these ties until the engine overtook you? A. Until I was going to step off to go to my switch.\nQ. The east-bound track was the one next to the shanty? A. The west-bound was the one next to the shanty.\nQ. How far is the shanty from the track? A. The shanty is about five or six yards.\nQ. Well, don't you think it was a very imprudent thing for you to do to walk on the end of the sleepers? A. How could I get across the track unless I walked there?\nQ. Were you going across the track? A. I was going to cross the track when I got to my switch.\nQ. You said you were going along the track on the outside of the rails? A. Yes.\nQ. And walking on the end of the sleepers? A. Yes, and I was going to cross the track, and how could I get to the switch?\nQ. I am asking you why you walked on the ends of those sleepers? A. Because I could not walk in any other way without being in more danger.\nQ. Why not? A. I never walked in the centre of the track.\nQ. Was there no other way of your getting to your destination except by walking on the ends of these sleepers? A. Yes; I could have crossed right over from the shanty door, but this other engine was coming along; I was keeping out of that engine's way.\nQ. Is there no space between the two tracks? A. Yes.\nQ. How wide is the space? A. A little wider than the track.\nQ. Why did you not go between the east and the west bound tracks? A. Well, of course, it was a sort of wet weather and it was drier on the ties, and I had wet feet at the time.\nQ. And you went on the ends of these sleepers because the ground was drier there? A. Yes.\nQ. That is the reason why you went? A. That is the reason.\nQ. Did you always walk on the sleepers? A. No, I never picked my way just that way. I went which way was the handiest to get to my switch.\nQ. Were you accustomed to go any other way? A. I always took the opposite track from the one I used to let the engine in on.\nQ. You took the space between the east-bound track and the west-bound track? A. No, sir, I kept outside of the west-bound track.\nQ. Do you mean outside the north side? A, Yes.\nQ. You always kept on that side? A. No, not always, for if the engine was ahead of me I would cross over ahead of the shanty right across the tracks and follow the engine on the track it was on.\nQ. Then you never walked in the space between the east and the west-bound tracks? A. Yes, I must have done that. I worked there for over a year.\nHis Lordship.\u2014It is admitted that it is the duty of the servants of the company to have the bell rung while an engine is passing through the yard?\nMr.\u2014German. Yes.\nMr.\u2014Cattanach. Yes.\nMr. German.\u2014Q. Do you know of your own personal knowledge how fast the engine was running? A.I know this that the engine had not started to leave the yard, it had not been coming up the side track when I left the shanty, but I only got five rails length when I was struck; Hugh McCourt hollered to me.\nQ. You say you did not see it coming; did you look to see? A. Yes, I looked when I came out of the shanty.\nQ. And there was no engine coming up that track? A. No; there was an engine on the east-bound track.\nQ. That you went to switch on? A. Yes.\nQ. Where would the engine that ran you down have to start from? A. Have to start about 200 yards away.\nQ. And so the time that you walked three or four rails length this engine came that distance and struck you? A. Yes. Certain questions were submitted to the jury which, with their findings thereon, are as follows:\u2014\n1. Was there negligence in the management of the engine? A. Yes.\n2. If so, what was it? A. By not ringing the bell, and to the best of our belief the engine was moving more than four miles per hour.\n3. How did the accident occur? A. Plaintiff was in the act of crossing the track to go to the switch in the performance of his duties.\n4. Could the plaintiff have avoided it by the exercise of reasonable care? A. No.\n5. Assuming that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, what do you think would be a fair sum for the company to pay him as damages? A. $45 a month, in all $1,620.\nUpon these findings judgment was entered for the plaintiff, which was affirmed by the Divisional Court on a motion to set it aside. The defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, basing their objection to the judgment on two grounds:\u2014\nFirst, that the injuries being caused by a fellow-servant of plaintiff, he could only recover by virtue of the Workmen's Compensation for Injuries Act, and that act does not apply to the defendant's company, which has been declared a work for the benefit of Canada, and brought under the operation of the Government Railways Act of the Dominion.\nSecondly, if the plaintiff could maintain an action, he was guilty of such contributory negligence as would preclude him from recovering damages.\nSymons for the appellants. As to contributory negligence see Woodley v. Metropolitan Railway Company[1]; Ryan v. Canada Southern Railway Company[2]. That the Ontario Act is ultra vires as regards this company see Darling v. Midland Railway Company[3]; Conger v. Grand Trunk Railway Company[4]; Clarkson v. Ontario Bank[5].\nS. H. Blake Q.C., for the respondent, referred on the question of negligence to Bridges v. North London Railway Company[6].\nThe constitutional question is decided by authority. Parsons v. Citizens Insurance Company[7]; Dobie v. Temporalities Board[8]; In re Toronto Harbor Commissioners[9].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014(After stating the facts as given in the judgment of Galt C.J. in the Divisional Court His Lordship proceeded as follows:)\nOn the trial the learned judge submitted certain questions to the jury[10], and on the argument the whole case turned on the fourth question submitted to the jury, namely, \"could the plaintiff have avoided the accident by the exercise of reasonable care?\" And to which as we have seen they answer \"No.\" The objection to the finding on this question is that it is not supported by any evidence and is against the weight of evidence. At the sitting of the Divisional Court the defendant moved against the verdict, which was sustained. The learned Chief Justice of that court in delivering judgment says:\u2014\nAs to the contributory negligence of the plaintiff the only ground on which this could be maintained would be if the plaintiff had not taken the trouble to look towards Montrose station before he started on the discharge of his duty; he swears positively that he did, and that when he did so no engine was visible. This question was very clear for the jury, for one witness of the name of Francis, called by the defendant who was the fireman of the engine which occasioned the injury, gave evidence which, if believed by the jury, would unquestionably have established the defence. He swore not only that he saw the plaintiff from time to time look towards the engine, but in answer to the question: \"Did you see the accident? Yes, What did you see? I saw him jump sideways on the footboard of the engine and catch hold of the rail with his right hand, stepped on with his right foot. Stepped on the footboard? Yes, with his right foot, and stumbled with his left, made the second stumble with his left foot which caused his right foot to slip off the board and he went right along side of the track and threw his arm across the rail.\" The jury did not believe this witness, and I confess I do not see how it would be possible for the accident to happen as described by this witness. The plaintiff had been so unfortunate as to lose his left arm by a former accident and how he could, after having caught hold of the rail of the engine fall in such a way as to bring his right arm under the wheel of the engine, I do not understand; his own account was as I have stated, namely, that his feet were knocked from under him, and in using his right arm to throw himself off the track his arm was crushed. It was plainly a question for the jury.\nIt was also urged that it was contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff that he did not at once, on leaving the shanty, cross the northern track and walk between the two tracks. The jury must have thought that there was no negligence on the part of the plaintiff when in discharge of his duty he availed himself (the ground being wet) of the ends of the ties in approaching the switch which was distant some 100 yards from the shanty, and speaking for myself, considering the nature of the railroad tracks, and that they were built on a narrow embankment, I think it was very natural for him to do so.\nThe motion was accordingly dismissed. An appeal was, by consent, taken direct to this court under the provisions of section 26, sub-section 2 of R. S. C. c. 135.\nHad the bell been rung, as it was admitted at the trial it was the duty of the servants of the company to have the bell rung while the engine is passing through the yard, it is difficult to conceive that the accident could have happened. The plaintiff was in the ordinary discharge of his duty. His duty required him to cross the track and he had about 100 yards to go. He was walking on the ends of the ties intending to cross the track when he got to the switch which he could not reach without crossing the track. His evidence on the point is this[11].\nI know of no rule of law which required the plaintiff to cross opposite the shanties in preference to going down the track and crossing opposite the switch. In either case he would have had to go down the track to reach the switch. It seems to me that the evidence in the case, in connection with the non-ringing of the bell and the rate of speed at which the jury find the engine was moving, could not have been withdrawn from the jury, and they having found that the plaintiff could not have avoided the accident by the exercise of reasonable care, and this finding having been confirmed by the Divisional Court, it should not now, in my opinion, be disturbed.\nI concur in the view that the Workmen's Compensation for Injuries Act applies to the appellants' Railway.\nFOURNIER J. concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. On the question of the application of the Workmen's Compensation for Injuries Act to Dominion railways, I am clear that Rowland's case was well determined.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014A servant of a railway company is, in my opinion, as liable as a stranger to be found guilty of contributory negligence when an injury occurs to him when unnecessarily walking on the railway track in a station yard, although he does so for the purpose of discharging some duty connected with his employment, which however, as in the present case, did not require him to walk upon the track in order to perform the service in which he was at the time engaged; and I am further of opinion that the doctrine of contributory negligence had better be abolished altogether if it can be held that the plaintiff was not a party contributing by his own culpable negligence to the injury which unfortunately he has received; while we sympathise with him in his misfortune we cannot, in my opinion, acquit him of having himself by his negligence contributed to his misfortune. In my opinion, therefore, this appeal should be allowed and the action in the court below dismissed.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I am of opinion that we should allow this appeal. The real question at issue was whether the injury to the plaintiff had been caused by the negligence of the defendants. It was not simply whether or not the defendants or their servants had been guilty of negligence, because they may have been guilty of negligence without that negligence being the cause of the injury. The plaintiff may have contributed to his own injury, and if he did so he cannot properly ascribe it to the negligence of the defendants. It frequently happens that the proof given of the negligence charged in actions like this will prim\u00e2 facie sustain the charge that that negligence caused the injury, and in those cases the allegation of contributory negligence becomes a separate issue. But if in proving the circumstances under which the injury occurred the plaintiff shows that he contributed to it himself, the result is that he tails to prove the essential fact that it was caused by the negligence of the defendants. In a case of that sort the defendants are entitled to a non-suit or a verdict in their favor upon the plaintiffs own showing[12].\nIt was palpable from the plaintiff's own evidence in this case that having two routes to choose between to reach the switch, one of which was safe, but somewhat muddy, and the other dangerous, he for his own convenience alone chose the dangerous one. The case might, therefore, properly have been withdrawn from the jury.\nThe position is not altered by the circumstance that the jury pronounced the opinion that the deceased could not, by the exercise of reasonable care, have avoided the accident. I might adopt, almost literally, the language of Lord Halsbury in Wakelin v. London & S. W. Railway Company[13] where he said:\u2014\nI do not know what facts the jury are supposed to have found, nor is it, perhaps, very material to enquire, because if they have found that the defendant's negligence caused the death of the plaintiff's husband, they have found it without a fragment of evidence to justify such a finding.\nThe negligence charged against the defendants was that of a fellow servant of the plaintiff. I do not rest at all upon that fact in holding against the plaintiff's right of action, because I see no reason to doubt the application to this case of the provincial statute, R.S.O. (1887), ch. 141. It is not legislation respecting such local works and undertakings as are excepted from the legislative jurisdiction of the provinces by article 10 of section 92 of the B. N. A. Act. It touches civil rights in the provinces. The rule of law which it alters was a rule of common law in no way dependent on or arising out of Dominion legislation, and the measure is strictly of the same class as Lord Campbell's Act which, as adopted by provincial legislation, has been applied without question to all our railways.\nI agree that the appeal should be allowed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Kingsmill, Cattanach & Symons.\nSolicitor for respondent: W.

The voyage was from Pubnico, N.S. to Lunenberg and\/or Halifax and the policy contained the usual clause allowing the vessel, in case of extremity, to put into and stay at, any port or ports without prejudice to the insurance\nThe vessel sailed on Dec. 15th, 1886, and on Dec 21st arrived off Shelburne harbor; the weather indicating a storm, she put in and remained in that harbor until next day when she attempted to proceed but returned to Shelburne; she did not go to sea again until Dec. 27th, when she started and again returned and remained in harbor until Jan. 3rd, when she started at midnight and a snow storm and head wind drove her back; on Jan. 4th she got as far as a place called Gull Rock when a heavy sea came on and she tried to put back, but at the entrance to the harbor in trying to tack she mis-stayed, and before an anchor would hold she struck on McNutt's Island and eventually went to pieces, the crew managing to get ashore.\nThe insurance company produced evidence by shipmasters familiar with the coast, and also from the log of a Dominion cutter then cruising in the same waters, to the effect that the vessel could have continued on her voyage at different times during the period of her stay in Shelburne, and it was also shown that other vessels bound on the same course did proceed during that period after seeking shelter in Shelburne.\nThe defendants had pleaded a number of pleas to the action, two of the defences raised being \"barratry of the master and mariners,\" and \"deviation by delay.\" The trial judge found that the vessel was designedly cast away, and gave judgment for defendants on the issue of barratry. In his judgment, which is published in full in the report of the case in the court below[2], he states that he attached little credit to the evidence of one of the witnesses., Nathan Snow, by whose testimony, mainly, barratry was established. The full court held that without the evidence of this witness the defence as to barratry must fail, but they confirmed the judgment for the defendants on the ground of deviation. From that decision the plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. Henry Q.C., and Bingay for the appellants. The only question we are called upon to argue is that of deviation, as there is no appeal against the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia that the defence as to barratry has failed.\nThe propriety of seeking a port, or sailing from it, at particular times must be left entirely to the discretion of the master, and more especially so in the case of small coasters navigating the dangerous waters of the Bay of Fundy. See The Sarah[3]; Turner v. Protection Ins. Co.[4]; The Oregon[5]; Phillips on Insurance[6]; Lawrence v. Minturn[7].\nThe only question in this case is: Did the master act in good faith? At the worst the facts only show error in judgment. Turner v. Protection Ins. Co.[8].\nBorden for the respondents. The facts have been found in favor of the underwriters by the trial judge and the full court below, and this court has invariably refused to interfere with such findings. The Picton[9]; McCall v. McDonald. (1).\nThe judgment on the ground of deviation is fully warranted by authority. Carver on Carriage by Sea[10]; Phillips on Insurance[11]; Marshall on Insurance[12]; Maryland Ins. Co. v. LeRoy[13].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J. (After stating the substance of the proceedings in the action and the nature of the appeal, His Lordship proceeded as follows): There can be no doubt that the understanding implied in the contract is not only that the voyage shall be accomplished in the track or, course of navigation in which it ought to be pursued, but also that the voyage shall be commenced and completed with all reasonable expedition, that is, with all reasonable and ordinary diligence, and that any unreasonable or unexcused delay, either in commencing or prosecuting the voyage insured, alters the risk and absolves the underwriter from his liability for any subsequent loss. No doubt it must be an unreasonable or inexcusable delay, that is, a wilful and unnecessary waste of time. In like manner as in the case of a departure from the usual course of navigation it is not necessary to prove that the peril has been enhanced, so it is equally clear that the same principle applies in case of deviation by delay.\nI think there was ample evidence to justify the conclusion arrived at by the full court, including Mr. Justice Townshend, the trial judge, who concurred with the other judges on the question of deviation. The court below thus puts the case:\nThe vessel in question the \"Village Belle,\" was a fishing schooner 40 tons burthen laden with a cargo of dry fish, which cargo was on the 30th November insured on a voyage from Pubnico to Lunenburg Halifax. The schooner, which was proved to be seaworthy and had new sails, left Pubnico on the 15th December. That night, although the wind was fair for going through Barrington Passage, she put into Doctor's Cove; she left there finally on the 20th and that evening put into Shelburne Harbor where she remained until the 4th day of January. The voyage from Shelburne to Lunenberg, to which port she was bound, could according to the evidence be made with a fair wind in seven or eight hours, and in my opinion the delay of 14 days in Shelburne Harbor was altogether unreasonable unless satisfactorily accounted for by the plaintiffs the onus being on them to do so. Capt. Lorway proved that a fair wind from Shelburne to Lunenburg would be any wind from south round westerly to north, and this is admitted by Larkin, the Master of the \"Village Belle.\" It was established by the mate of the Government cruiser \"L. Houlett\" who regularly kept the log of that vessel, that at Shelburne on the 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 26th, 27th and 28th days of December and the 2nd and 3rd days of January the wind and weather were such that the \"Village Belle\" could have continued her voyage, and it appears that one or more schooners bound to the eastward which had put into Shelburne Harbor did proceed during that period.\nIn answer to this the master of the Tillage Belle enters into no particulars\u2014admits he cannot remember how the wind and weather on each day of his stay in Shelburne were\u2014he kept no log and contented himself with stating generally that he could not proceed on his voyage, without, as the court below says, attempting to justify the delay between the 27th December and the 3rd of January.\nMichael Belliveau, one of the crew of the Village Belle, says on cross-examination \"I cannot undertake to say anything as to the wind on different days nor the weather nor as to reasons for not sailing.\" And John Wiman another of the crew, says \"I left vessel 2nd January 1887\";. on cross examination he says \"I cannot swear wind was unfavorable for our voyage the night we went to Cape Negro. I do not speak of character of wind or weather after I went into Shelburne; and then on his re-examination he says:\u2014\nThe weather from the time we left Pubnico Harbor till we got to Shelburne was so unfavorable we could not proceed on our voyage.\nBut he also says: \u2014\nCannot say what weather was on 22nd, or 23rd of Dec. nor on 24th, 25th, or 26th. I know the day before I left, Saturday, there was a heavy south east gale and continued in afternoon more southerly. I left vessel Sunday 26th January. Cannot speak of weather 28th, 29th, 30th or 31st. I remember on January 1st there was bad weather, and on Sunday there was rain all day.\nThe captain of the Dominion cutter, who was in Shelburne harbor, says that on the 28th December he rendered assistance to the schooner Ospray bound from Boston to La Have which had struck a rock off Baccarot and within a day she proceeded on her voyage, La Have being about sixty miles to eastward of Shelburne in direction of Halifax; and he says\u2014\"a fair wind from Shelburne to Lunenburg would be anything from south round westerly to north.\" He describes the wind and weather while in Shelburne from day to day and says, \"If vessel was sea-worthy nothing to prevent her proceeding on her voyage.\"\nIf such was the case it is evident that the captain's remaining in a harbor when he could have proceeded on his voyage was in this case wholly unjustifiable and amounted to a clear deviation. It is therefore impossible, in my opinion, for this court to say the court below was wrong in so holding.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Ritchie in the court below.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014To an action on a policy of marine insurance the defendants pleaded no less than sixteen pleas, two of which only were rested upon at the trial, and these two are as follows:\n\"10th. The defendants further say that after the commencement of the said voyage and before the alleged loss, the said vessel deviated from the voyage;\" and\n\"13th. The said loss occurred and was caused by the barratry of the master and mariners on board of the said vessel which was not insured against by the said policy.\"\nThe learned judge who tried the case rendered a verdict for the defendants upon this latter plea, although the only direct evidence in support of it was the evidence of one Snow, a hand on board, as to whom the learned judge said that he made an unfavorable impression upon him as to his honesty and truthfulness; but he thought that this man's evidence, notwithstanding, taken with other circumstances, such no doubt being the facts relied upon as evidence of voluntary deviation, was worth something; and he added that without any reference to Snow's evidence he came to the conclusion that the vessel was deliberately cast away by the captain, and he therefore found a verdict for the defendants upon the plea of barratry.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on the appeal was of opinion that without the testimony of Snow there was not sufficient evidence to sustain the contention that the loss was occasioned by the barratry of the master; in this opinion I concur. The Supreme Court was further of opinion that the fourteen days delay in Shelburne harbor was altogether unreasonable unless satisfactorily accounted for, and that it was not at all accounted for, and the defendants were therefore entitled to judgment upon the plea of deviation. Upon a careful perusal of the log of the Government schooner L. Houlett, the accuracy of which is testified to, and the evidence in relation to the weather during the period of that delay, the captain of the insured vessel having himself kept no log, I cannot say that the judgment of the Supreme Court upon the plea of deviation is not well founded, and the judgment of that court should, in my opinion, be maintained, and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: George Bingay.\nSolicitor for respondents: R.

J. and Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nLife insurance\u2014Application for\u2014Reference to application in policy\u2014Warranty\u2014Mis-statement.\nThe bond of membership in an insurance society insured the member holding it \"in consideration of statements made in the application herefor,\" &c., and in a declaration annexed to the application the insured agreed that the bond should be void if the statements and answers to questions in the application were untrue.\nHeld, that the application was a part of the contract for insurance and incorporated with the bond.\nThe said declaration warranted the truth of the answers to the questions and of the statements therein, and agreed that if any of them were not true, full and complete, the bond should be null and void. One of the questions to be answered was: \"Have you ever had any of the following diseases? Answer opposite each, yes, or no.\" The names of the diseases were given in perpendicular columns and at the head of each column the applicant wrote \"no,\" placing under it, and opposite the diseases named, marks like inverted commas. On the trial of an action to recover the insurance on a bond issued pursuant to this application it was found that the applicant had had a disease opposite to which one of these marks was placed.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that whether the applicant intended this mark to mean \"no.\" and thus to deny that he had had such disease, or intended it as an evasion of the question, the bond was void for want of a true answer to the question.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment at the trial for the defendants.\nThe plaintiff is administrator of one Gibson, formerly of Lawrencetown, N.S., and the action is upon a bond of membership, called in the pleadings a policy of life insurance, in the defendant company. The bond was expressed on its face to be made in consideration of statements made in the application therefor, and the application contained a declaration and warranty that the answers and statements therein were full, complete and true, and that such declaration and warranty formed the basis of the agreement between the insured and the society. The application was not, in terms, made a part of the policy, or bond, and nothing contained in it was in, or indorsed on, the bond.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Ritchie without a jury, and judgment was given for the defendants on the ground that the assured had misrepresented a material fact, having stated in his application that he never had had certain diseases, and the learned judge holding that he had one of those diseases at the time. On appeal the Supreme Court affirmed this judgment and dismissed the appeal without costs which were refused because it appeared that the defendants set up a number of defences, many of which were speculative, and that the defence was framed to suit any evidence that might be fished up at the trial. Also, that defendants had only succeeded on one of the numerous defences set up.\nFrom the judgment of the full court affirming the judgment of the trial judge the plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nBorden for the appellant. This society holds a license from the Dominion Government under the Insurance Act, R.S.C. ch. 124, and is, therefore, subject to the provisions of that act. Then the benefit of the application cannot be claimed in this case, as it is not contained in, nor indorsed on, the policy as required by sections 27 and 28 of the statute. The following sections also bear on the case, namely, sections 2, 3, 29-31 and 36-43.\nIf the declaration and warranty in the application can be used as a defence it must be shown that the alleged misrepresentation was of a material fact and that it was untrue to the knowledge of the applicant. Taylor v. Etna Ins. Co.[2]; Fowkes v. Manchester & London Life Assurance Association[3]; Jarvis v. Marine and General Life Insurance Co.[4].\nThe learned counsel also argued that the misrepresentation was not proved.\nHenry Q.C. for the respondent. If the Dominion Insurance Act applies to this company it cannot be held to repeal or abrogate the statute in Nova Scotia making the application a part of the policy.\nAs to the distribution of legislative powers for purposes of insurance see Parsons v. Queen Insurance Co.[5].\nThe learned counsel argued at length the point raised on the evidence.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The learned judge who tried this case says in giving judgment:\u2014\nIt is in evidence that the bond or policy in question in this case was issued on the application of the assured, in which he was required to answer certain questions. One of these was\u2014Have you ever had any of the following diseases? answer opposite each \"Yes\" or \"No.\" Then follows a list of diseases, arranged in seven columns; opposite the disease at the top of each column the word \"No\" is written, and below the word \"No\" opposite the names of the other diseases in each column, two marks are placed thus, \u2014\" \u2014 which marks are opposite the word \"Syphilis.\"\nAs I interpret the application., these marks mean \"no,\" and the meaning is the same as if that word had been written after the disease called syphilis. It has been proved to my satisfaction, and I find, that the assured was suffering from the disease of syphilis in 1883, and was treated for it by Dr. Bell. I find that the assured misrepresented that fact to the defendants at the time he applied for the bond or policy in question, and that such misrepresentation was material to the risk, and the fact that he had previously been suffering from the disease of syphilis should, in that view, have been communicated to the defendants at the time of the application for the policy. On these grounds I am of opinion that the plaintiff cannot succeed in this action.\nI cannot say that there was not sufficient evidence to justify the learned judge in arriving at the conclusion that Dr. Bell had treated a person by the name of Gibson for syphilis and that the person so treated had at the time of such treatment that disease, nor can I reasonably doubt under the evidence that the person so treated was the insured. The question then simply is: Did the declaration of the applicant and the answers to the questions put to the insured form the basis of the contract? Were they expressly or impliedly incorporated with the policy, that is, did it form a part of the contract that any untrue statements, omissions or suppressions contained in the application and answers should avoid the policy? If so, the authorities clearly establish that the application and policy must be construed together and together form the contract, in which case the truth of the representations and answers becomes a condition precedent to the liability.\nI cannot conceive that stronger language could be used to incorporate the application and make it part of the contract. The bond witnesseth that \"the company in consideration of statements made in the application herefor, and the payment of $7 and the receipt thereof, etc.;\" and the application provides that \"all applications must be written plainly in ink. Before forwarding the application to the home office, agents should see that all questions have been properly answered.\" To which is added this declaration or statement:\u2014\nDeclaration: It is hereby declared and warranted that the foregoing answers and statements are full, complete and true, and it is agreed that this declaration and warranty shall form the basis, and shall be a part of, the contract between the undersigned and the Mutual Relief Society of Nova Scotia, and are offered to said society as a consideration of the contract applied for and subject to all the limitations and requirements of the constitution and by-laws, all of which are hereby made part of the bond of membership, and if any of the statements, representations, or answers made herein are not true, full and complete, and if I or my representatives shall omit or neglect to make any payment as required by the conditions of said bond, then the bond to be issued hereon shall be null and void, and all the money paid thereon shall be forfeited to said society, and it is further agreed that the membership hereby applied for shall be subject to all the conditions and agreements contained in the bond of such membership.\nI think the learned judge was right in reading the word \"no\" as applicable to all the questions even if it was necessary to go so far, because if the answers are not full and complete the bond is to be void. In the examination of the deceased by the medical officer, inter alia, one question to that officer is, \"Have you carefully read the questions and answers thereto of the person applying for examination as recorded on the reverse side, and have you paid particular attention to any vague terms that may have been used therein?\" To which the medical officer's answer is \"Yes.\" To the second question, \"Has the person now or has he ever had any of the following diseases or disorders? If yes, state disease, date, duration and severity.\" Answer, \"None.\" This list includes syphilis, and to this the deceased signed his name, and the declaration signed by the applicant distinctly states that the foregoing answers and statements are full, complete and true, and in the certificate of the medical examiner he states that the applicant stated that the answers given to the questions put by him are correct. All these papers were transmitted to the company and on them he became a member and obtained the instrument on which he now sues. If this is so, any untrue representations, whether material or not, avoid the policy. See Anderson v. Fitzgerald[6].\nThe learned judge having found, and I think on sufficient evidence, that the deceased had had the disease syphilis, one of the diseases named, to which in his answer to the question \"Have you ever had any of the following diseases (including syphilis)? answer opposite each Yes or no,\" I think he answered \"No\" or did not answer at all, in either of which cases if the answer was false or the question was not answered the policy or bond was rendered void; and the correctness of the answer having been warranted by the declaration whether the untrue statement was material or not is quite unimportant as the party must adhere to his warranty.\nI therefore think the appeal should be dismissed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014(His Lordship referred at some length to the statutes incorporating the defendant company, passed in 1884, and particularly secs. 3, 9, 10 and 11. He then read the declaration in the application for membership[7] and the bond of membership issued thereon and after setting out the pleadings proceeded as follows)\u2014\nNow it cannot, I think, be doubted that the learned judge who tried the cause came to a correct conclusion when he found, as matter of fact, that the Alfred Gibson who made the application to the defendant society, upon which the bond of membership sued upon was issued, was the same Alfred Gibson who was proved before him to have had, in an aggravated form, one of the diseases mentioned in the application of a very serious nature and which, in his application, he had declared and warranted that he never had had, and that this constituted a breach of warranty in a very material point. I am of opinion, also, that the learned judge might well have held upon the evidence that Gibson had falsely declared and warranted that no proposal to insure his life had ever previously been made by him, for it was expressly proved that there had been, and that he had been medically examined upon his application to another company, and that no policy had issued thereon; so, likewise, that he had falsely warranted that he was in good health when he made his application to the defendant company. I can see no reason to doubt the evidence of Mr. Gates because of his being a member of the defendant society and one of their agents, and his evidence leads, I think, to the conclusion that when Gibson applied for membership in the defendant society he was, and that as he well knew, in bad health and remained so in and from the month of July, 1886, until his death. Between the 6th and 9th August, two days after the execution of the bond of membership, he worked for Mr Gates off and on until the 19th of August, 1886. Mr. Gates says that when he first went to work for him, on the 7th of August, he complained very much of pain in his back and side and loss of appetite, and that he got some medicine from Mr. Grates. On the 12th and 13th of August he worked for him again, and then complained of same trouble; on the 19th he complained of feeling very unwell, and looked so\u2014he seemed to be in great pain and distress\u2014Mr. Gates wanted him to go to bed. He objected, and was afraid he would die; however, they got him to bed and he got up before night. After he got round, he told Mr. Gates, as he says he thinks, that he had been subject to this kind of spells, but not so bad, before. He told Mr. Gates that he had been treated by doctors in Yarmouth and Digby, but that they did not seem to know what was the matter with him and Mr. Gates says that he did not look like a man in good health. Upon the whole there can, I think, be no doubt that the learned judge who tried the case, in the judgment which he rendered for the defendants, came to a sound conclusion.\nAs to the rectification asked for in the statement of claim no foundation is laid for it, nor in point of fact does any appear to exist. We see that the claim for \"rectification\" as it is called is rested upon ch. 124 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, but the 3rd section of that act enacts that the provisions of the act shall not apply to any company incorporated by act of the legislature of any Province forming part of Canada which carries on the business of insurance wholly within the limits of that Province by the legislature of which it was incorporated and which is within the exclusive control of the legislature of such Province, but such company carrying on the business of life insurance may, by leave of the Governor in Council, avail itself of the provisions of this act, and if it so avails itself the provisions of this act shall thereafter apply to it, and such company shall have the power of transacting its business of insurance throughout Canada; and by the 43rd section it is enacted that:\u2014\nNothing in this act contained shall apply to any society or association of persons for fraternal, benevolent, industrial, or religious purposes among which purposes is the insurance of the lives of the members thereof exclusively, or to any association for the purpose of life assurance formed in connection with such society or organisation and exclusively from its members and which insures the lives of such members exclusively.\n2. Any society or association which is declared by this section to be exempt from the application of this act may nevertheless apply to the Minister to be allowed to avail itself of the provisions of the seven sections next preceding, and upon such application being assented to such society or association shall cease to be so exempt by virtue of this section.\nThe seven next preceding sections here referred to are sections relating to life insurances, by \"Mutual or Assessment Life Insurance Companies.\" Now whether the 3rd section of this act as above extracted applies to any companies other than those incorporated simply for the purpose of carrying on the ordinary business of life insurance, and whether this 43rd section applies at all to fraternal, benevolent, industrial and religious societies incorporated by the legislature of one of the provinces of the Dominion, and if it does, what is the effect of any such company obtaining the allowance of the Minister to its availing itself of the provisions of the seven sections next preceding the 43rd, and whether such allowance would have the effect of doing away with the provisions contained in the local act even within the limits of the Province by the legislature of which the company is incorporated, are matters not necessary to be determined in the present case, for although it appears in evidence that the defendant company, incorporated by an act of the legislature of Nova Scotia, did make application under the above 43rd section of the Dominion act to be allowed to avail itself of the provisions mentioned in that section, yet no allowance to that effect was effectually granted until the assent of the Minister was published in the Canada Gazette of the 7th August, 1886, nor was it communicated to the defendant society otherwise than by such publication in the Gazette; so that until then it was not competent for the defendant society to avail itself of the provisions of the act referred to in the said 43rd section and the bond of membership now sued upon, having been issued, and the contract therein contained made, upon the 4th of said month of August cannot be subject to the provisions of the Dominion act. It is unnecessary for the like reason to consider the point raised in relation to the 27th and 28th sections of the Dominion act, the former of which, however, has application only to conditions subsequent such as those mentioned in the conditions set out on the face of the bond of membership and not to a warranty of the truth of matters upon the faith of which the contract is based; and as to the 28th section, if it applied in the present case, it is obvious that the untrue statements which are relied upon as breaches of the warranty were material to the contract. Upon the whole I am of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed.\nPATTERSON J. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Ritchie & Ritchie.\nSolicitor for respondent: Jas.

Ritchie C.J., and Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nWill\u2014Interest\u2014Contingent interest\u2014Protection against waste.\nD. was entitled to a legacy under a will provided he survived the testator's wife, and during her lifetime he brought suit to protect his legacy against dissipation of the estate by the widow.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that D. had more than a possibility or expectation of a future interest; he had an existing contingent interest in the estate and was entitled to have the estate preserved that the legacy might be paid in case of the happening of the contingency on which it depended.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment in favor of the defendants at the trial.\nThe plaintiff brings his suit to protect his right to a legacy under the will of one John Duggan, of Halifax, claiming that the estate is being dissipated. The two clauses of the will material to the case are the following:\n\"I give, devise and bequeath unto my dear wife, Johanna, all and singular my real and personal estate, property, monies, goods, chattels and effects, whatsoever and wheresoever, of every kind and description, to have and to hold the same and every part and parcel thereof to my said wife, Johanna, her heirs, executors, administrators and assigns forever.\"\n\"And my will is further that, in case there should be any child or children of my deceased brother, Maurice, formerly of Dungarven, in Ireland, living at the time of the decease of my said wife, then that such child or children should receive out of the proceeds of my said property, at her decease, the sum of three thousand pounds, Halifax currency.\"\nThe plaintiff is the only child of Maurice Duggan named in the second of the above clauses. The wife, Johanna Duggan, who is the executrix of the will, is still alive, but she has mortgaged the real estate of the testator to the respondents (Millers), to secure her personal debts, in consequence of which this suit was brought. On the trial Mr. Justice Townshend decided that the plaintiff could not maintain the suit as he had no present, but only a future and contingent, interest in the estate. The full court, on appeal, affirmed the judgment at the trial.\nE. L. Newcombe for the appellant. The cases relied upon to support the judgment in the court below did not deal with contingent interests but only with estates in expectancy depending on mere possibilities. See judgment in Davis v. Angel on appeal[1].\nThe learned counsel was stopped by the court.\nBorden for the respondent. It is only in exceptional cases that the court will interfere to protect contingent interests. Dowling v. Dowling[2]; Kevan v. Crawford[3]; Hampton v. Holman[4]; Annual Practice 1889\u201390[5].\nThe legacy is only chargeable upon the personal estate. Theobald on Wills[6]; Bentley v. Oldfield[7].\nThe whole property is given to the wife absolutely, and a later clause in a will does not take effect over such a paramount devise. The devise to the plaintiff is, therefore, void for repugnancy; Byng v. Lord Strafford[8], affirmed on appeal to House of Lords sub nomine, Hoare v. Byng[9]. In Howard v. Carusi[10] all the cases on this subject are collected. And see Percy v. Percy[11].\nThe learned counsel also referred to Davidson v. Boomer[12]; Theobald on Wills[13].\nNewcombe in reply cited Allan v. Gott[14]; Curtis v. Sheffield[15]; Cunningham & Mattinson's Pleadings[16].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think the plaintiff had more than a possibility or expectation of a future interest, but that he had a present existing contingent interest in the testator's estate and has a right to maintain an action to have his legacies secured This interest is vested by the testator's will; the enjoyment of it depends on a contingency, but the present interest does not the less exist. His right has come into existence; that right is to receive out of the testator's estate \u00a33,000, in case he survives the defendant, Johanna Duggan; and what he now seeks is simply to have that right declared and his legacy secured, so that it may be paid to him in the event of his surviving the said Johanna Duggan which seems to me to come very clearly within the language of Lord Eldon in Allan v. Allan[17] where he says:\u2014\nSome things are very clear. First, it is perfectly immaterial how minute the interest may be, how distant the possibility of the possession of that minute interest: if it is a present interest. A present interest the enjoyment of which may depend upon the most remote and improbable contingency is nevertheless a present estate; and as in the case upon Lord Berkeley's will, (Lord Dursley v. Fitzhardinge Berkeley, 6 Ves. 251,) though the interest may with reference to the chance be worth nothing, yet it is in contemplation of the law an estate and interest. On the other hand, though the contingency be ever so proximate and valuable, yet if the party has not by virtue of that an estate, the court does not deal with him.\nAnd on the following page the Lord Chancellor says,\nThere is no case in which the tenant in tail has not been considered, as between him and his issue, as having the entire interest. The statute de donis certainly does say that the estate is to go according to the form of gift, and gives the forms of writs, which are of different sorts; but I cannot find that any Formedon was ever brought by the issue during the life of the tenant in tail. That demonstrates that the estate is in the tenant in tail for the time being himself; and then the reasoning that applies to the tenant in fee, must apply to the tenant in tail.\nIn the case of Lord Berkeley's will referred to the Lord Chancellor says:[18]\nA contingent interest is not the less a present interest.\nIt would seem very clear that if the appellant is refused the relief he seeks there is but a very small, if any, chance of his realising the legacy if the contingency on which its payment is to be made should happen. I cannot think the law so helpless as to allow an executrix and trustee to waste and dispose of the trust estate for her own purposes as was done in in this case, under, as it were, the very eyes of the court, and that the court should be unable to protect the estate so as to be available, on the happening of the event contemplated, for the purposes of distribution in accordance with the provision of the testator's will.\nI therefore think this appeal should be allowed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I agree in the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice for allowing the appeal.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs. GWYNNE J.\u2014The question in this case turns upon the true construction of the last will and testament of John Duggan, deceased, in his life time the husband of the defendant Johanna Duggan. John Duggan died in the month of November, 1865, having first duly made and published his last will and testament upon and bearing date the 28th day of August, 1865, whereby, after providing for payment of his debts and funeral expenses, he devised as follows:\u2014\n2. I give, devise and bequeath unto my dear wife Johanna, all and singular my real and personal estate, property, monies, goods, chattels and effects whatsoever and wheresoever, of every kind and description, to have and to hold the same and every part and parcel thereof to my said wife Johanna, her heirs, executors, administrators and assigns forever.\nAnd my will is further that in case there should be any child or children of my deceased brother Maurice, formerly of Dungarven, in Ireland, living at the time of the decease of my said wife, then such child or children should receive out of the proceeds of my said property at her decease the sum of three thousand pounds, Halifax currency.\nNow upon the well established principle that a will must be construed so as to give effect, if possible, to every word a testator has used, I am of opinion that this devise operates as a devise to the testator's wife Johanna and to her heirs, executors, administrators and assigns forever, subject to a charge in favor of such of the children of the testator's deceased brother, Maurice, as should be living; at the time of the decease of testator's wife Johanna. It appears that the testator's brother Maurice had died ten years before the testator made his will, as the testator well knew; it appears also that when the testator made his will the plaintiff was the only child of his deceased brother Maurice who was living; so that in effect the devise to Johanna was made subject to a charge of \u00a33,000 in favor of the plaintiff, contingent upon his surviving the devisee Johanna his aunt. Now whether his charge be a present bequest vested in interest in the plaintiff subject to be divested in the event of his not surviving Johanna, or a bequest contingent upon his surviving her, there can, I think, be no doubt whatever that he has such an interest under the will as entitles him to the interference of the court to have the property subjected to the charge preserved in such a manner that it shall be forthcoming to be applied in payment of the bequest in his favor in the event of his surviving his aunt Johanna. The appeal therefore must be allowed with costs, and a decree be ordered to be made referring it to the master to enquire into particulars of the property devised, and as to the disposition thereof, and to report to the court in the ordinary manner.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014 Concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Meagher, Drysdale & NewCombe.\nSolicitor for respondent Duggan: A.

Ritchie C. J., and Fournier, Taschereau Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nDebtor and Creditor\u2014Assignment in trust\u2014Release by\u2014Authority to sign\u2014Ratification\u2014Estoppel.\nTo an action by L. against A. the defence was release by deed. On the trial it was proved that A. had executed an assignment for benefit of creditors and received authority by telegram to sign the same for L. The deed was dated 8th October, 1881, and afterwards, with knowledge of it, L. continued to send goods to A., and on 5th November, 1881, he wrote to A. as follows: \"I have done as you desired by telegraphing you to sign deed for me, and I feel confident that you will see that I am protected and not lose one cent by you. After you get matters adjusted I would like you to send me a cheque for $800\" * * * In April, 1885, A. wrote a letter to L., in which he said: \"In one year more I will try again for myself and hope to pay you in full.\" In November, 1886, the account sued upon was stated.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, Taschereau and Patterson JJ. dissenting, that the execution of the deed on his behalf being made without sufficient authority L. was not bound by the release contained therein and never having subsequently assented to the deed, or recognized or acted under it, he was not estopped from denying that he had executed it.\nHeld, per Taschereau and Patterson JJ., that though A. had no sufficient authority to sign the deed yet there was an agreement to compound which was binding on L. and the understanding that L. was to be paid in full would be a fraud upon the other creditors of A., who could only receive the dividends realized by the estate.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, reversing the judgment at the trial in favor of the plaintiff.\nThe action in this case was on an account stated and the defence that plaintiff had released his claim by deed. On the trial it was shown that defendant executed an assignment for the benefit of his creditors on 8th October, 1881, the plaintiff being a creditor. With knowledge of the assignment plaintiff continued to supply defendant with goods, and on 11th October, 1881, he wrote the following letter:\u2014\n\"Mr. Anderson,\n\"Dear Sir,\u2014Your letter of the 7th received to-day. I have every confidence in you, and hope you will continue on in business, and I shall be ready to furnish you with all the goods you want in my line. I did not feel like pressing you for funds, although I have been short and hard pushed at times so that I had to hire. I was somewhat astonished to hear the news Saturday morning that you had suspended, but I felt so sure you would not allow me to be injured that I sent the goods last Saturday that I had marked for you just before I received the news. I cannot afford to lose a cent, for I have worked hard for 20 years and just got enough to live on. I shall leave my interest in your hands and know you will see me protected. Let me know what you want me to send on next steamer. If you could get a good lot of sound Early Rose it will be a good thing; sold to-day at $2.80 per bbl., for fine stock bbls. well filled; Prolific, $2.50 per bbl.; Damson Plums $3.50 per bushel.\"\nThe defendant was authorized by telegram to sign the deed for plaintiff, and on 5th November plaintiff wrote him as follows \u2014\n\"W. C. Anderson, Esq.,\n\"Dear Sir\u2014Your letter duly to hand. I have done as you desired by telegraphing you to sign deed for me and I feel confident that you will see that I am protected and not lose one cent by you. After you get matters adjusted I would like you to send me a check for $800, as there will be six months before you will have to pay any dividend, and think it will be easier to send me a cheque for that amount. I trust you will be all straight again before next summer, so we will be able to do a large business.\"\nAfter this nothing appears to have been done in the matter until 1885. On 14th April of that year defendant wrote to plaintiff showing the condition of his affairs, and in that letter he said \"in one more year I will try again for myself and hope to pay you in full * * * If the Lord helps me you shall receive every dollar.\"\nIn November, 1886, the account sued on was stated between the plaintiff and defendant, and the action was brought in the following year. In a letter to defendant under date of 24th September, 1887, plaintiff stated that he wished to get judgment before the six years' limitation expired and wished to have his claim secured by the judgment in case of accident.\nOn the trial before Mr. Justice Townshend judgment was given for the plaintiff, the learned judge holding that there was no authority for defendant to sign the deed of assignment in plaintiff's name, and that plaintiff had done nothing since amounting to an adoption or re-delivery of the deed. The full court reversed this decision, the majority being of opinion that there was a sufficient agreement by the plaintiff, dehors the assignment, to compromise his debt. The plaintiff then appealed to this court.\nEaton Q.C. for appellant referred to Taylor on Evidence[1]; Tupper v. Foulkes[2]; Hunter v. Parker[3]; Forbes v. Limond[4].\nNewcombe for the respondent cited Field v. Lord Donoughmore[5]; Winslow on Private Arrangements[6]; Tupper v. Foulkes[7]; In re Baber's Trusts[8].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014As Mr. Justice Ritchie pertinently remarks in the court below: \"The question is not whether the plaintiff executed the deed in accordance with the principles of the common law, but whether after it was executed for him by the defendant on the strength of the telegram from the plaintiff to the defendant, desiring the defendant to sign the deed for him, he so assented to it or recognised or acted under it as to be bound by the release it contained.\" I must confess the evidence of assenting to it or recognising it appears to me to be extremely slight, and I can discover no evidence whatever of any acting under it. The only evidence of any assent or recognition of the deed is in the letter of the 24th September, 1887, in which the appellant says, \"I have written Seeton & Thompson a number of times and got no reply.\" So that it would appear that Seeton & Thompson did not recognise him as a party having a right to information in reference to the deed, if indeed the letter sought such information; but as these letters were not put in by either party I presume no inference can be drawn from them one way or the other.\nIt is to be observed, however, that the plaintiff from the first does not appear to have relied on the deed. The deed was dated on 8th October, 1881. On 11th October, 1881, the plaintiff writes this letter[9].\nOn 5th Nov., 1881, the plaintiff writes another letter, stating that he had done as defendant had desired by telegraphing him to sign the deed (5). It will be observed in this letter that although he authorizes him to sign the deed he does not look to the deed for his protection, as he says: \"I feel confident you will see I am protected and not lose one cent by you,\" And it is obvious he does not look to the deed or the assignees for payment of dividends under it, because he says: \"After you get matters adjusted I would like you to send me a cheque for $800, as there will be six months before you will have to pay any dividend, and I think it will be easier to send me a cheque for that amount.\"\nOn 14th April, 1885, defendant writes plaintiff; after stating what he had given up, he says: \"In one more year the engagements (which he had referred to) will be given up, and I will try again for myself, and hope to pay you in full;\" and again: \"If the Lord helps me you shall receive every dollar.\"\nOn the trial Joel Lawrence, a son of the plaintiff, gives this testimony:\u2014\nJoel Lawrence, sworn:\u2014I am son of plaintiff. Reside in Boston. My father resides there, and I am in his employment. I knew defendant last year. Went to see him respecting matters in dispute last November. I saw him in his store. Showed him statement of account due to my father, and wished him to sign it, so that we might have a combined account of what was due to my father. Mr. Macdonald was there. This is the account I presented to him We looked it over, and he told his clerk, Macdonald, to examine it with his books, and if correct to sign it. We went in, compared it with his books, and Macdonald acknowledged this to be a correct statement, and signed it, \"W. C. Anderson, per Macdonald,\" and I signed my name at the same time as a witness. Macdonald erased one item so as to make it agree with his books. The account as contained in this paper agrees with his books. I was looking over him while he checked it off. This was the first time I saw Anderson.\nCross-examined:\u2014Macdonald and W. C. Anderson were both clerks of Willoughby Anderson at time. He took down Charles Anderson's ledgers. I saw this account in a ledger. Saw some items. In dealings after defendant's suspension, we had overdrawn on him $170, which is the item erased. I remember the time of defendant's suspension. My father knew he had assigned to Seeton & Thomson. I did not go to see Seeton & Thomson. The defendant was examined, and does not contradict or explain away in any respect this letter, or deny in any way his liability on this account so stated. Mr. Cathcart Thomson was examined; he merely states that he was one of the assignees with Seeton, and that he was not associated in any other way in business with Seeton; that this was the only transaction; but he does not say one word as to having recognized the plaintiff in any way as a party to the deed of assignment, or that the plaintiff in any way assented to it or recognized it as binding on him.\nOn the 24th September, 1887, plaintiff writes to defendant that he felt anxious to have defendant's account fixed up, so that in case he, plaintiff, should be taken away, his wife and children should have something to show in case defendant was fortunate and had means to pay in the course of the next ten years. He says: \"I thought it would be more secure than the papers I now hold.\" He then says he has written letters to Seeton & Thomson a number of times and got no reply, and supposed he was doing right to get judgment before the six years limitation expired.\nThis certainly does not look like an assent to or recognition of the deed, or any idea that he had released the defendant from liability, and having stated the account with the plaintiff after this took place I think he should be bound by it.\nI think the judgment appealed from should be reversed and the appeal allowed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. I adopt the reasoning of McDonald J. in the court below.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I can not see in the evidence anything sufficient to estop the plaintiff from insisting that the deed of release pleaded to the action by the defendant is not his deed, and if he is not estopped from so insisting the judgment must, in my opinion, be in his favor. I am of opinion, therefore, that the appeal should be allowed with costs, and that judgment should be entered for the plaintiff in the court below for the amount of the account stated, with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The plaintiff, who is appellant, is not, in my opinion, entitled to have the judgment disturbed.\nI agree that the release cannot be treated as the deed of the defendant, because it was not executed by him nor by any authority given by deed, nor was it afterwards ratified or re-delivered as his deed.\nBut the transaction evidenced by the instrument was an assignment by the debtor of property for distribution among his creditors or such of them as should become parties to the instrument within a specified time, and by which the parties to the instrument accepted their distributive shares in full satisfaction of their respective debts. That was the operation of the release clause and the transaction was, in effect, a composition between the debtor and the creditors who became parties to the instrument.\nThe agreement to compound was a binding agreement without deed, and the plaintiff gave express written authority to attach his name as a party to the instrument.\nIt does not seem to me to admit of doubt that he could have insisted on sharing with the other creditors the dividends under the arrangement. The fact that he did not do so is relied on on his behalf as telling against his being bound by the composition. His letter of the 5th of November, 1881, which repeats the authority to sign his name to the deed, seems to show pretty plainly that he did not claim dividends because he had an understanding that he was to be paid in full, partly before the dividends were, as he understood it, to become payable, and the rest eventually. That agreement strikes me as being a fraud upon the other creditors, and the effect now claimed for the forbearance to rank under the composition is very like another way of reaching the same result.\nThe argument, as I apprehend it, is to this effect: Sign the composition agreement; let the other creditors come in on the faith of your coming in; then don't ask for dividends and you will not be bound.\nThe defence as amended pleads the execution of the agreement by written authority. It goes on to make other allegations of subsequent acts which may not be borne out by the evidence, though I am not prepared to refuse a good deal of significance to the absence of any repudiation and to the standing by while the other creditors acted on the terms of the agreement which the plaintiff had signed, but I take the plea to be sufficient to admit proof of the agreement by the signature alone.\nThe view that I take has been so well and so fully expounded in the judgments delivered in the court below by Macdonald, Weatherbee and Ritchie JJ. that it is unnecessary for me to occupy time by going over the same ground, or by examining the authorities which those learned judges discussed and acted upon. But upon the question of the right of this defendant to urge against the plaintiff the fraud upon the creditors to which the defendant was himself a party, I refer to Geere v. Mare[10], as a case at law in which a security given in pursuance of an agreement in fraud of creditors, not unlike that indicated in the letter of the 5th November, 1881, was held void as founded on an illegal consideration, and to the remarks of Malins, V.C., in McKewan v. Sanderson[11], where the principle is stated and several decisions referred to.\nIn my opinion we should dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: Horace L.

There were six legacies of \u00a350 each to other children of the testator, and these were to be paid by the devisees at the expiration of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 years respectively. The estate vested before the statute abolishing joint tenancies in Nova Scotia came into operation.\nHeld, reversing the decision, of the court below, Taschereau and Gwynne JJ. dissenting, that these provisions for payment of debts and legacies indicated an intention on the testator's part to effect a severance of the devise, and the devisees took as tenants in common and not as joint tenants.

R. 406) followed.\nOn the trial of a suit between persons claiming through the respective devisees to partition the real estate so devised evidence of a conversation between the devisees, which plaintiff claimed would show that a severance was made after the estate vested, was tendered and rejected as being evidence to assist in construing the will.\nHeld, Gwynne J. dissenting, that it was properly rejected.\nHeld, per Gwynne and Patterson JJ. that the evidence might have been received as evidence of a severance between the devisees themselves, if a joint tenancy had existed.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favor of the defendants. The plaintiffs and defendants are the representatives respectively of Joseph and James Clark, devisees under the will of one Robert Clark. The estate under the will vested before the statute abolishing joint tenancies in Nova Scotia came into operation and that statute does not affect it.\nThe clauses of the will on which the contentions raised in this case are based are the following:\u2014\n\"To my two sons, Joseph Clark and James Clark, their heirs, executors, and assigns, I give and bequeath the farm on which I now live, saving and excepting that portion of it which I shall hereinafter dispose of, together with the western half of the lot of marsh on Belle Isle which I now own, and likewise the lot of land which I lately purchased, the same being formerly a part of the estate of the late Henry Ricketson, and which I now own, together with all my right, title and interest in all the said mentioned lands. I also give and bequeath to them, my two said sons, their heirs, executors, and assigns, all the live stock which I am or may be in possession of at my decease, saving and excepting the two cows before mentioned bequeathed to my wife, together with all my farming utensils, and monies which may be due to me by note or account, and all goods and chattels of whatsoever kind which is not hereinbefore disposed of, and which I shall or may be in possession of at my decease. And I further will and ordain that my two said sons, Joseph Clark and James Clark, their heirs, executors, and assigns, shall jointly and in equal shares pay all my just debts, and likewise such legacies, as I shall hereafter appoint, will, or ordain them to pay.\"\n\"To my son Charles Clark I give and bequeath the sum of fifty pounds, to be paid to him by my sons, Joseph Clark and James Clark, at the expiration of two years after my decease, one-half to be paid in cash and the remaining half to be paid in neat stock at the market price, the same to be delivered at the barn of the said Joseph and James Clark.\"\nAnd similar legacies to five other children of the testator payable at the expiration of 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 years respectively.\nThe plaintiffs, who claim as devisees of James Clark one of the two sons named in the first of the above clauses, contend that the estate created thereby was a tenancy in common, and they bring their action for a partition of the real estate and an account of the rents. The defendants, claiming through Joseph, contend that it was a joint tenancy and James having died before Joseph the latter took the real estate by right of survivorship. The court below give effect to this latter contention and have decided in favor of defendants.\nIn the minutes of the trial the following appears:\u2014\n\"Mr. Ritchie offers evidence of a conversation between James and Joseph in 1848 to assist in construction of Robert's will made in 1842. Objected to on several grounds and rejected.\" The full court, on appeal, held it was properly rejected.\nHarrington Q.C. for the appellants. The courts in modern times lean against joint tenancies, and will lay hold of the slightest expressions as evidencing an intent to sever. See Kew v. Rouse[2], Milward v. Milward cited in Beauclerk v. Dormer[3].\nThis court has dealt with the matter in Fisher v. Anderson[4], where the authorities are fully considered.\nAs to the use of the word \"jointly\" and its effect on the construction of the will, see Booth v. Arlington[5], Miller v. Miller[6]. The learned counsel also cited the following cases on this point: Oakley v. Wood[7], Ettricke v. Ettricke[8], Joliffe v. East[9], Fleming v. Fleming[10].\nThere should, at all events, be a new trial for improper rejection of evidence to show how they treated their tenancy, and that they agreed to regard themselves as joint tenants. Harrison v. Barton[11], Williams v. Hensman[12].\nBorden for the respondents cited Cooke v. De Vandes[13], Boughton v. Boughton[14].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think the evidence offered of a conversation between James and Joseph to assist in the construction of Robert's Will made in 1842 was properly rejected.\nThe question whether James and Joseph took the estate devised to them as joint tenants or as tenants in common turns on the last clause of the devise which is as follows[15].\nIt does not appear what amount of debts, if any, the testator owed at the time of his death; judging from the whole tenor of the will one might fairly infer that they could not have been to a very large amount.\nThe legacies of \u00a350 each amounted to \u00a3350 payable half in cash in 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 years; half in cash and half in neat stock at the market price to be delivered at the barn of Joseph and James Clark. The bequests are in this form respectively[16].\nIt is difficult to understand that the testator could have intended the estate to be used by Joseph and James as joint tenants, whereby the one brother on the death of the other before the expiration of the respective times fixed for the payment of the legacies would take all the property devised and the estate of the deceased brother be trusted with the burthen of the payment of his equal share of the debts or legacies unpaid at the time of his decease, or having paid the debts and legacies the property, on his death, should survive to his brother. These provisions for the payment of debts and legacies appear to me to indicate an intention of severance sufficient to justify the conclusion that a tenancy in common and not a joint tenancy was created. Having discussed the question at length in the case of Fisher v. Anderson [17] I do not feel it necessary now to discuss the matter at greater length as I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the conclusion at which the court arrived in that case.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014One Robert Clark departed this life on the 21st of October, 1842, having first duly made and published his last will and testament, whereby amongst things he devised as follows[18].\nThe testator then devised and bequeathed as follows:\nTo my son Charles Clark I give and bequeath the sum of fifty pounds, to be paid to him by my sons Joseph Clark and James Clark at the expiration of two years after my decease, one-half to be paid in cash, and the remaining half to be paid in neat stock at the market price, the same to be delivered at the barn of the said Joseph and James Clark.\nThe testator then bequeathed like sums of fifty pounds to be paid to five others of his children respectively, in precisely similar terms as in the bequest to his son Charles, save only that the bequests to these five others were made payable respectively at the expiration of three, four, five, six and seven years after the testator's decease.\nThe question now is whether the estate in the land devised to Joseph and James Clark was an estate in joint tenancy or a tenancy in common, the defendants insisting that it was the former, and the plaintiffs, who are the appellants, that it was the latter. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in which the land devised lies, have maintained the contention of the defendants.\nApart from the provision in the will as to the payment of the testator's debts and legacies by his two sons, Joseph and James, there can be no doubt that the devise to Joseph and James of the chattel property as well as of the land, was in joint tenancy. The only question, therefore, is whether or not the clause as to the payment of the debts and legacies has the effect of converting a devise otherwise in joint tenancy into a tenancy in common. It cannot be doubted that the court will lay hold of any, even a very slight, expression in a devise as indicative of a testator's intention to create a tenancy in common rather than a joint tenancy. Sir Richard Pepper Arden, in Morley v. Bird[19], lays down the rule as it is still applied. He says there:\u2014\nUnless there are some words to sever the interest taken it is at this moment a joint tenancy, notwithstanding the leaning of the courts lately in favor of a tenancy in common. A legacy of a specific chattle, a grant of an estate, is a joint tenancy. It is true, the courts seeing the inconvenience of that, have been desirous wherever they could find any intention of severance to avail themselves of it, and their successive determinations have laid hold of any words for that purpose: \"Equally o the divided,\" \"equally,\" \"among,\" \"between,\" even in law, I believe, certainly in equity, create a tenancy in common, but without those words it is a joint tenancy.\nAnd Lord Hatherly, in Robertson v. Fraser[20], says:\nAnything which in the slightest degree indicates an intention to divide the property must be held to abrogate the idea of a joint tenancy and to create a tenancy in common.\nKew v. Rouse[21], is strongly relied upon by the appellants. There Elizabeth Wise devised a term of years of which she was possessed to her two daughters, \"they paying yearly to her son \u00a325 by quartly payments, viz., each of them \u00a312.10s yearly out of the rents of the premises during his life if the term so long continued\" but by this devise each was to pay \u00a312 10s yearly, and out of the rents accruing from the term devised, and such payments would be out of the share of each in the rents and, therefore, it was held to be a tenancy in common; but in the will under consideration the devise is that the testator's two sons, Joseph and James, to whom the real and personal property of the testator had just been devised, in language which standing alone clearly was a joint tenancy, \"shall jointly and in equal shares pay all the testator's debts and legacies, the latter in manner following, that is to say\u2014at the expiration of two years from testator's death to one son the sum of \u00a350 one half in cash and the remaining half in neat stock, at the market price, to be delivered at the barn of the said Joseph and James, and a like legacy to be paid in like manner to other children, respectively, of the testator, at the expiration of three, four, five, six and seven years after the testator's death. I cannot say that the language used in giving these bequests, so to be paid by the testator's sons, Joseph and James, indicates an intention upon the part of the testator that the previous devise of the personalty to his said sons, Joseph and James, in language which constituted a joint tenancy, should be, nevertheless, taken as a tenancy in common, and as to the realty which was devised in joint tenancy, and with which alone we are concerned, the language in which those bequests are given has, in my judgment, no effect. Indeed, the language, to my mind, seems rather to imply that the testator contemplated that his two sons, Joseph and James, would work the farm, and enjoy the benefit of the stock thereon, devised to them, in partnership together for, at least, the period of seven years after his death. But although this intention may not sufficiently appear upon the testator's will it was quite competent for the devisees to have entered into an agreement to that effect, and if they had and continued working the farm in partnership together until the death of James in 1848, then would arise a question, which is made and insisted on by the appellants, that a severance had taken place in the lifetime of James upon the authority of Jackson v. Jackson[22] and Williams v. Henseman[23]. In this latter case it was laid down by W. P. Wood, V.-C., as well recognized law, that a joint tenancy may be severed by mutual agreement, or by any course of dealing sufficient to intimate that the interests were mutually treated as constituting a tenancy in common, and that this was so in the present case was expressly pleaded by the plaintiffs' eleventh replication. The evidence which was offered upon this point should have been received. It was, I am satisfied, a mistake to treat it as having been offered for the purpose of construing the testator's will; from its nature it could not have had that effect, but might have been abundantly sufficient to establish the fact of severance of the joint tenancy by the joint tenants themselves The eleventh replication above referred to further pleaded that the life estate devised by James in his realty, to his brother Joseph in 1848, was so devised at the express request of Joseph. If this should be established, as perhaps it might have been by the evidence which was rejected, then a further question might arise, quite independently of any severance having previously taken place by agreement and conduct of the parties, whether under such circumstances persons claiming under Joseph would not be estopped from disputing the estate in remainder devised by James in the real estate which he had so devised to Joseph for life.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs, but that the case should be sent down for a new trial to have the above points dealt with.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I concur with his Lordship the Chief Justice in construing the will of Robert Clark as making his sons Joseph and James tenants in common of the real and personal property devised and bequeathed to them.\nThe general terms of the direct gift would, it is true, create a joint tenancy if uncontrolled by any other indication of the intention of the testator, but we have, in my opinion, a reasonably clear indication of his understanding that he was giving separate interests to the devisees. The debts and legacies are clearly charged upon the property by the direction that they shall be paid by the devisees, and when it is added that the two devisees shall pay them in equal shares we have in effect the charge imposed half on the interest of Joseph and half on the interest of James, or an expression of the testator's intention and understanding that the two brothers were to take the property in equal shares.\nThere would be no difficulty in the way of this construction were it not for the word \"jointly.\" Joseph and James, their heirs, executors and assigns, are to pay the debts and legacies \"jointly and in equal shares.\" I think more stress was laid on this word \"jointly\" in the court below than can have been contemplated by the testator. He evidently had in his mind that the two sons would, for a time at all events, occupy and work the farm together. This appears not only by the use of the word \"jointly,\" but by the directions in respect of the six legacies of \u00a350 each, payable respectively in two, three, four, five, six and seven years after his decease, that one-half should be payable in neat stock delivered at the barn of the said Joseph and James Clark. But if we credit the testator with having in view the technical effect of the language he was using, which is not very likely, he must have known that a joint tenancy could be severed at any time, and that he was not providing for a continued joint occupation, while at the same time a joint occupation was not inconsistent with a tenancy in common; and these very provisions for payment out of the produce of the farm recognise separate interest in the profits, interests \"in equal shares,\" which comes very close to an express recognition of interest in equal shares in the farm itself. The use of the words \"jointly\" is thus explained without weakening the force of the expression \"in equal shares.\"\nNor must we overlook the fact that the payments, jointly and in equal shares, are to be made, not only by James and Joseph but by \"their heirs, executors and assigns.\" Operation for these words might perhaps be found even if the estate were a joint tenancy in the first place and were afterwards severed by the tenants, but they do not seem to be used in that view by the testator. They rather go to negative the contemplation of either devisee taking the whole estate by survivorship.\nOn the point as to the rejection of evidence I shall merely say that while it cannot be for a moment maintained that conversations between the devisees could be used to aid in construing the will, which is noted as the ostensible object in offering the evidence, it may be regretted that the evidence was not received. It might have been evidence of a severance if a joint tenancy had existed, and it strikes one as possible that the short note that the evidence was offered to assist in the construction of the will may not fully express the object in offering the evidence which is said to have been \"objected to on several grounds and rejected,\" the grounds not being specified.\nThe point is, however, unimportant in view of the construction of the will on which our judgment proceeds.\nI agree that the appeal should be allowed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: C.

On the trial of an action to recover the insurance, evidence was given by shipowners and mariners to the effect that, according to commercial usage, the said description in the policy would include the Guano Islands, and there was evidence that when the insurance was effected a reduction of premium was offered for an undertaking that the vessel would load guano. The jury found, on an express direction by the court, that the island where the vessel loaded was on the western coast of South America within the meaning of the policy,\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the words in the policy must be taken to have been used in a commercial sense and as understood by shippers, shipowners and underwriters; and the jury having based their verdict on the evidence of what such understanding would be, and the company being aware of a guano freight being contemplated, the finding should not be disturbed.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick sustaining the verdict at the trial for the plaintiff and refusing a new trial.\nThe action in this case was upon a marine policy, insuring the \"Minnie H. Gerow\" in the sum of $5,000 for a voyage from Melbourne to Valparaiso for orders, thence to a loading port on the western coast of South America or San Francisco, thence to a port of call and discharge in the United Kingdom. * * * The vessel sailed to Valparaiso in ballast and went from there to Lobos de Afuera, one of the Guano Islands on the western coast of South America, where she loaded with guano and sailed for Falmouth. Having encountered very severe weather soon after sailing the captain took the vessel to Valparaiso where a survey was ordered and, according to the surveyor's report, it would have cost more to repair her than she would be worth when repaired. The plaintiff, thereupon, gave notice of abandonment and claimed from defendant company payment under the policy for a constructive total loss.\nThe company resisted payment on a number of grounds, but the only one urged on this appeal was that of deviation from the voyage insured, it being contended that loading at an island some miles from the mainland of South America was not complying with the policy, which specified a loading port on the coast.\nThe action was twice tried. On the first trial the jury were directed, as a matter of law, that Lobos de Afuera was a port on the western coast of South America within the meaning of the policy. A verdict having been given for the plaintiff at that trial, and sustained by the full court in New Brunswick, the company appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada and obtained a new trial on the ground of misdirection in withdrawing from the jury whether or not the policy was complied with by the vessel loading at Lobos[1]. On the second trial the matter was left to the jury by the following question being asked them: Is Lobos, a guano island, a loading port on the western coast of South America? To which they answered \"yes.\" Evidence was given at this trial by shipowners and mariners to the effect that the policy would be understood, in the shipping trade, to allow loading at the guano islands, and the plaintiff swore that when the insurance was effected the company's agent offered to make the premium 1\/8 or 1\/4 less if he was assured that the vessel would load guano at one of the islands.\nThe second jury found a verdict for the plaintiff which was again sustained by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick. The company then brought this appeal.\nStraton for the appellant. It is not sufficient in a case like this, to prove the usage of shipowners and charterers. It must be shown that the usage among underwriters would justify the voyage taken by plaintiff's vessel. McGivern v. Provincial Ins. Co.[2].\nAs to the proof of custom required see Hall v. Benson[3].\nWeldon Q.C. for the respondent referred to Robertson v. Clarke[4].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014This cause was before this court on a former occasion when a new trial was ordered on the ground that the only material question in the case, namely, whether Lobos, an island from 25 to 40 miles distant from the mainland of South America, was a loading port on the western coast of South America, under the policy which insured the vessel for a voyage from Melbourne to Valparaiso for orders, thence to a leading port on the western coast of South America or San Francisco, and then to a port of discharge in the United Kingdom, had been withdrawn from the jury. On the second trial this question was distinctly left to the jury in these words \"Is Lobos, a guano island, a loading port on the western coast of South America?\" To which the jury answered, \"Yes.\"\nI think there can be no doubt that the evidence established that Lobos was a loading port, though an open roadstead where the loading of ships with guano cargoes took place, and to which vessels frequently resorted and used for the purpose of loading. The cases cited by Mr. Justice Fraser in his very able and exhaustive judgment clearly established this.\nThen, was this a loading port on the west coast of South America within the terms of the policy? There was evidence given to show that in a commercial sense the terms a \"loading port on the western coast of South America\" would include the guano islands; the contention appears to have been that no island whatever could be such a loading port; that the terms used could only mean the mainland of South America. This was certainly a question to be determined by the usages of trade and the meaning put on them by the mercantile world, and in this case evidence was admitted to show that in mercantile acceptation \"a loading port on the western coast of South America\" included the loading ports at the guano islands, which formed a part of the territorial possessions of Peru or Chili, a portion of territory comprised under the general words South America.\nThere was the evidence of Captain Lordly, who says: \"From Valparaiso we went to Lobos de Afuera, a port on the western coast of South America.\" Captain Thompson who had been twice at different guano islands says: \"I think Lobos was a loading port on the western coast of South America.\" Captain Moran, who had loaded several times at the guano islands, considered the guano islands as loading ports on the western coast of South America. Then there was the evidence of a member of the firm of Troop & Son and of George F. Smith, large shipowners and charterers, who very clearly showed that, in a commercial point of view, a loading port on the west coast of South America would include the mainland and islands, and that the principal cargoes shipped were nitrate and guano, nitrate from the mainland and guano from the islands; and the evidence that Ranney, when the policy was effected, said to Gerow that if he would assure him that the cargo to be carried was guano instead of nitrate he would do the insurance an eighth or a quarter less, clearly showing that Ranney fully understood that the vessel had the right to load guano which could only be done at one of the guano islands.\nI know of no persons more competent to speak on this subject than experienced ship-owners and charterers and ship masters. Mr. Justice Fraser shows very clearly that there was a constructive total loss. There is nothing in the objection as to want of preliminary proof and if there was it was clearly waived.\nMr. Justice Fraser's very able and exhaustive judgment relieves me from the necessity of discussing at greater length this case. I quite agree with the court below that the verdict should not be disturbed.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The only question remaining on this action, which is one upon a policy of marine insurance for the loss of a ship of the plaintiff insured by the appellants, (a point as to whether there was a constructive total loss having been abandoned by the appellants at the hearing), is whether or not the Island of Lobos, which is a guano island, lying west of the Peruvian Coast, in South America, is a \"loading port on the west coast of South America,\" and whether the loading of the ship with guano there would be a deviation from the voyage for which the vessel was insured, namely, \"from Melbourne to Valparaiso for orders, thence to a loading port on the western coast of South America or San Francisco, then and thence to a port of call and discharge in the United Kingdom, &c.\nThe question thus raised is one of fact merely, and the rule to be applied is that in construing such a contract its terms must be taken to have been used \"in their business sense,\" as is the expression of some judges, or \"in their common and ordinary sense,\" in relation to the subject matter, as is the expression of others, or, \"in their popular and commercial sense,\" which is the expression of others, all of which Brett, Master of the Rolls, in Sailing Ship Garston Co. v. Hickey[5], deemed to be equivalent phrases. The language of Lord Herschell in Hunter v. Northern Marine Insurance Co.[6], as applied to the term \"port,\" is precisely applicable to the present\u2014and as so applied will read:\nI agree with tihe view which has been more than once expressed by learned judges that in construing such a contract as that with which we are dealing the [words] must be taken to have been used in [their] popular or commercial sense, that is to say, as [they] would be understood by shippers, shipowners and underwriters. Where there is a common understanding among such persons as to the [application of the terms used] the matter is free from difficulty.\nNow, the evidence is abundant, that among such persons there is such a common understanding which (founded apparently upon the fact that guano is one of the chief articles of export from the west coast of South America, and that it is got only upon islands such as Lobos), is that the terms used in the policy sued upon do cover a voyage to Lobos for guano and loading there. In the present case there is this further evidence, that at the time of the insurance being effected the guano islands were spoken of by the plaintiff as places to which the vessel he was insuring might be sent for guano, and that the defendants offered to insure him for a less premium than he paid if he would limit the vessel to loading with guano alone, which he could not undertake to do for she was going to Valparaiso for orders. It must, therefore, be held that the going from Valparaiso to Lobos and loading there with guano, did not constitute a deviation from the voyage for which the vessel was insured; the plaintiff, therefore, is entitled to retain his verdict, and this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be dismissed and the judgment affirmed on the grounds fully and ably discussed in the judgment of Mr. Justice Fraser in the court below, and expressed in that now delivered by my brother Gwynne.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Gilbert & Straton.\nSolicitors for respondent: Weldon & McLean.\n[1] 14 Can.

Upon the death of the assured the person to whom the policy was made payable sued the company, and at the trial it was proved that the answers given by the applicant as to his health were untrue the insurer's own medical attendant stating that insured's was a life not insurable.\nHeld, 1st, that the policy was thereby made void ab initio, and tbe insurer could invoke such nullity against the person in whose favour the policy was made payable and was' not obliged to return any part of the premium paid.\n2nd That the statements constituting the misrepresentations being referred to in express terms in the body of the policy, the provisions of secs. 27 and 28 R.S.C., ch. 134 could not be relied on to validate the policy, assuming such enactments to be intra vires of the Parliament of Canada, which point it was not necessary to decide\n3rd That the indication by the assured of the person to whom the policy should be paid in case of death and the consent by the company to pay such person, did not effect novation ; Art. 1174 C. C and the provisions contained in Art. 1180 C.C. are not applicable in such a, case. It is too late to raise an objection for the first time on the argument before the Supreme Court that the legal representatives of the assured were not made parties to the cause.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side), reversing a judgment of the Superior Court, which condemned the respondent company to pay to the appellant $2,000, amount of a policy.\nThis was an action brought by the appellant Venner against the respondent, the Sun Life Insurance Company, claiming to recover $2,000, the amount of a policy on the life of Jean Langlois, an advocate of Quebec alleged to have been effected by Langlois for the benefit of his creditor Venner, the appellant, as his interest might appear.\nThe policy, dated the 19th of January, 1886, was issued \" without conditions.\" Langlois died the 8th March, 1886, and the present action was instituted on the 24th day of August, 1886.\nThe pleas were : 1st, a general denial ; 2nd, an exception alleging fraud and misrepresentation in obtaining the policy. At the trial the misrepresentations proved to have been practised to obtain the policy were, that Langlois' answers to the questions put to him were untrue, especially as regards his state of health and his having applied to other insurance offices to procure a policy ; that the answers as given were consistent with Langlois' life being' a first-class life whilst Dr Lemieux, a witness and Langlois' own medical attend ant, stated that Langlois' was not a life insurable as the term is generally understood.\nAmyort Q.C. and Geoffrion Q.C. for appellant.\nThis was an unconditional policy issued since the Dominion statute ch. 124, sec. 27, came into force. If this Statute is intra vires of the Dominion Parliament then all the precedents contrary to the new law and all the commentators of the laws of other countries are not applicable. Henceforth no policy can be impaired for reasons other than those printed on the policy itself.\nUnder art. 2480 C.C. once the policy is issued it be-comes the contract between the parties and in this case the contract which is binding is the policy issued by the company in favour of the appellant, and not the application of Langlois. See also art. 2587 C.C.\nThe company in this case have accepted the appellant as their creditor and under art. 1180 C.C., they cannot now oppose to him the exceptions which they might have set up against Langlois. If a policy with- out conditions is made payable ab initio to a third party in good faith it cannot afterwards be annulled by reason of the false and fraudulent statements of the person whose life is insured. Clark Law of Insurance ([1]) Roscoe's Digest of Law of Evidence ([2]) ; and moreover, the company, perfectly knowing by its officers Langlois' state of health, cannot take advantage of false statements which he made in regard to it. Bigelow ([3]).\nWe also contend that in accepting the premium from Its agent when fully knowing Langlois' state of health, the company has waived all objection as to Langlois' health.\nPorter ([4]); Angell ([5]); Herbault, Assurances sur la vie ([6]); Samson Digest Law of Insurance ([7]); Bigelow ([8]).\nA policy cannot be annulled against a third party, in good faith, to whom it has been made payable ab initio. Clark Law of Insurance ([9]). Roscoe's digest of law of evidence ([10]). And in Wheelton v. Hardisty ([11]) it was held by the Exchequer Chamber that the false and fraudulent statements of the person whose life is insured and of the medical referee will not vitiate the policy, as against an innocent person who effected insurance, there being no condition that the untruth of the statement contained in the policy should avoid the policy.\nTo decide otherwise would be an act against the common law and the principles of a most elementary justice.\nThe 1180th article of the Civil Code of L.C. says :\u2014\nThe debtor consenting to be delegated cannot oppose to his new creditor the exceptions which he might have set up against the party delegating him, although at the time of the delegation he were ignorant of such exceptions.\nApplied to this case that article would read as follows : \" The company consenting to be delegated to Venner, by making the policy payable to him, cannot oppose to Venner the exceptions which it might have set up against Langlois.\"\nThen, finally, we contend that the court below declared the policy void because the legal representatives are not parties to this contestation.\nNow that Langlois is dead, that Venner has no recourse against him, can the company plead its own act, its own error, to deprive him of a legitimate claim ? Be it in good or in bad faith, the company is responsible for its own deeds, arts. 1053, 1065 C.U. The company is bound to warrant Venner a third party in good faith and make good towards him the terms of its policy. Different it might be had the policy been made payable to Langlois and by him transferred to Venner.\nLangelier Q.C. for respondents.\nUpon the facts as proved there can be no doubt that a \u00abtoss fraud had been committed in effecting this assurance. If so that vitiates the policy, and Venner has no more rights than the legal representatives of the assured would have. R.S.C., ch. 124, has no application, because the policy itself declares it is issued upon the statements contained in the application, and the provisions of art. 1180 C.C. are only applicable when there is novation. Art 1174 C.C. is the article which is applicable to the facts of this case.\nAs to return of premium. The case of Parent v. N. Y. L.. Ins. ([12]) has settled the jurisprudence of our courts on this point, and if a policy is null on account of being obtained by fraud, such nullity maybe invoked by the insurer without any return of premium paid. It is too late now to raise an objection as to whom should be parties to this contestation.\nSir W. J. Ritchie C.J. and Strong and Patterson JJ. concurred in dismissing the appeal.\nTASCHEREU J. This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, which reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, dismissed the appellant's action against the company.\nThe action is one claiming from this company the sum of $2,000 being the amount of a policy on the life of one Jean Langlois effected on 19th January, 1886, by said Langlois for the benefit of and made payable to his creditor, the present appellant, said Langlois having died on the 8th of March 1886.\nThe company pleaded to this action that the said policy had been obtained by fraud and false representations, and the judgment appealed from dismissed the action on that plea.\nAs to the falsity of the representations made by Langlois in his answers on the most material particulars to the questions put to him on the application for this policy the evidence leaves no room for doubt. The appellant himself could not but admit it and concede that if the action had been instituted by Langlois' representatives it could clearly not have been maintained.\nNow, this being so, how can the present plaintiff have more rights than Langlois himself or his representatives would have had? It is sound law (though not without exceptions to which I need not here refer) that, as a general rule nemo plus juris transferre potest quam ipse habet. Now, if, as conceded by the appellant, Langlois himself or his representatives could not have recovered upon this policy it is because this policy as held by the Court of Appeal, is null and void from its inception, or to be more correct, I should say, must be avoided with retroactive effect to its inception. It was agreed to by the company, in express words \" sur les r\u00e9pr\u00e9sentations, conventions et stipulations contenues dans la demande pour cette police.\" These representations being proved to have being utterly false in the most material particulars it follows that the company never became bound under this policy. They agreed to pay to the present appellant the sum of $2,000 at Langlois' death, but upon the express condition that if Langlois' answers, on the application were later proved to have been false, the policy would then be null and void. Such are the express terms of the application signed by Langlois.\nNous, soussign\u00e9s, d\u00e9clarons que la personne don't l'assurance sur la vie est demand\u00e9e, est \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent en bonne sant\u00e9 et n'est pas afflig\u00e9e d'aucune maladie ou maux internes; et que les r\u00e9ponses aux questions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes sont vraies et exactes. Il est de plus convenu et stipul\u00e9, que cette d\u00e9claration formera la base du contrat entre nous et la Compagnie d'Assurance Mutuelle sur la Vie, Le Soleil, de Montr\u00e9al ; et nous nous engageons aussi \u00e0 payer la prime de la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e et \u00e0 accepter la police quand elle sera \u00e9mis e par la dite compagnie ; et si quelques fausses r\u00e9pr\u00e9sentations out \u00e9t\u00e9 faites dans cette d\u00e9claration ou dans les r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 \u00eatre donn\u00e9es au m\u00e9decin examinateur en rapport avec la dite application, toutes les valeurs qui auront \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es \u00e0 la dite compagnie, pour le compte de l'assurance accord\u00e9e, seront confis qu\u00e9es et la police deviendra nulle et sans effet.\nThis is plain enough, it seems to me, and, as I have before remarked, this stipulation is in express terms referred to in the body of the policy, so that the appellant cannot invoke against the company section 27, chapter 124 R. S. C., assuming this enactment to be intra vires of Parliament and otherwise applicable, two points upon which it is not here necessary to pass.\nThe following are the articles of the code bearing on the case :\u2014\n2485. The insured is obliged to represent to the insurer fully and fairly every fact which shows the nature and extent of the risk, and which may prevent the undertaking of it, or effect the rate of premium.\n2487. Misrepresentation or concealment either by error or design, of a fact of a nature to diminish the appreciation of the risk or change the object of it, is a case of nullity. The contract may in such case be annulled although the loss has not in any degree arisen from the fact misrepresented or concealed.\n2488. Fraudulent misrepresentations or concealment on the part either of the insurer or of the insured is in all cases a cause of nullity of the contract in favour of the innocent party.\n2490. Warranties and conditions are a part of the contract, and must be true if affirmative\u2014otherwise the contract may be annulled, notwithstanding the good faith of the insured.\nThe foregoing general provisions are declared, by article 2585 to be applicable to life insurance:\n2588. The declaration in the policy of the age and condition of health of the person upon whose life the insurance is made, constitutes a warranty upon the correctness of which the contract depends. Nevertheless, in absence of fraud the warranty that the person is in good health is to be construed liberally, and not as meaning that he is free from infirmity or disorder.\nI refer to Hartigan v. The International L. Ass -Society ([13]), also to five cases in France ([14]), where it was held that: Il y a lieu d'annuler le contrat d'assurance dans l'int\u00e9ret de l'assureur lorsque l'assur\u00e9 a, de mauvaise foi, par ses r\u00e9ticences ou fausses d\u00e9clarations, d\u00e9natur\u00e9 \u00e0 son profit l'opinion du risque servant de base au contrat. Ainsi, il y a fausse d\u00e9claration de nature \u00e0 rendre l'assurance annulable lorsque l'assur\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'aucune compagnie n'avait refus\u00e9 de proprositions d'assurance sur sa vie, tandis que sur une de mande d'assurance par lui faite ant\u00e9rieurement, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9pondu que l'affaire \u00e9tait ajourn\u00e9e, ce qu'il avait interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame comme un refus. Peu importe qu'en ne mentionnant pas cette circonstance, l'assur\u00e9 n'ait fait que suivre le conseil d'un agent de Ia compagnie ([15]).\nand note thereto, also note to report of same cases in Dalozz ([16]).\nI refer also to Merger, Assurances ([17]) ; Blin, As surances ([18]) ; Gr\u00fcn & Joliat ([19]) and B\u00e9darride Dol. & Fraude ([20]). All of the last author's commentaries on art. 348 of the French Code de Commerce, on marine insurance, are clearly applicable with us to life insurance, as our code re-enacts in arts. 2485 to 2492 said art. 348 of the Code de Commerce and makes the rules as to misrepresentations or concealment applicable to all kinds of insurance. Arts. 2503, 2504, 2585.\nIt was urged for the appellant that the company should have, with their plea, offered to return him the premium they have received. But there are three conclusive answers to that contention. First in the in the agreement I have cited signed by Langlois, at the foot of his application, it is expressly stipulated that if any of his answers to the questions put to him are false, the policy shall be null and all premiums paid shall be confiscated.\nSecondly, in law even in the absence of such an agreement it has been held that\u2014\nEn cas d'annulation du contrat d'assurance pour r\u00e9ticence ou fausse d\u00e9claration accomplie de mauvaise foi par l'assur\u00e9, l'assureur n'est pas tenu de restituer les primes pay\u00e9es, Paris, 1878, Sirey. 80, 2,225, re Dominique. Thirdly, the receipt for the premium is from Langlois himself, not from Venner. Venner, it is true, is proved to have actually paid it. But he, by doing so lent so much to Langlois, or acted as his agent. So that this premium, should the company be bound to return it, must be returned, not to the appellant, but to Langlois representatives.\nAnother objection involved by the appellant is that Langlois' legal representatives should have been made parties to this contestation. It would certainly have been more regular so to do. But what interest has the appellant to raise this point ? Is not that invoking jus tertii ? Then, what prevented him from himself calling in Langlois' heirs, either in the first instance, upon his action, or subsequently when the company fyled their plea ? He never took this objection before the courts below. There is not even a word of it in his factum before this court. It is only at the last moment of the case at its final hearing, that he raises it for the first time. He has fought this company before three courts, and, at the last moment complains of not having had the proper parties en cause. Now, this cannot be done. I refer to the cases of Richer v. Voyer ([21]) in the Privy Council, and Guyon v. Lionais ([22]) in the Superior Court which I cited in Russell v. Lefran\u00e7ois ([23]) before this court on this point.\nThe appellant further contends that, though Langlois' representatives could have no action against the company yet he, the appellant is in a better position as the company cannot as against him invoke Langlois' fraud. In support of this contention the appellant relies on art. 1180 C.C. which enacts that\nThe debtor consenting to be delegated cannot oppose to his new creditor the exceptions which he might have set up against the party delegating him. This article, though not in the Code Napoleon in express terms, is the law in France to the present day. I refer for the jurisprudence to the cases cited Nos. 21, 25, under art. 1277 ([24]). The article however has no application to the present case. It applies only to a d\u00e9l\u00e9gation parfaite, and no such delegation took place between Langlois, Venner and the company. There was no novation. Venner was not for the company \" a new creditor,\" as required by article 1180. This article moreover does not apply to a conditional obligation, such as the company agreed to towards Venner. They agreed to pay Venner, as I have already remarked, upon the representations, conventions and stipulations contained in the application for the policy ? These representations were false and fraudulent ; there consequently has never existed a binding contract upon the company. It seems to be settled now in France by the Cour de Cassation that the stipulations by a insured that the insurance should be payable to a third party is nothing else but the stipulation for the benefit of a third party mentioned in Art. 1029 of the Code ([25]). It had been likewise previously determined in re Dominique ([26]) that the nullity of a policy consequent upon false it presen tations est opposable au cessionnaire et \u00e0 tous autres auants droit comme elle le serait \u00e0 l'assur\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame. In the Lesay case also, ([27]) a policy was annulled as against an assignee for false representations by the insured.\nThe fact relied upon by the appellant that Langlois died from the consequence of a fall, and not from any previous disease, cannot affect the result of the case. for doubt. The commentators, in France, are not unanimous on this point but with us art. 2487 C. C. leaves no room. And even in France, in one of the most recent cases on the question, it was held that :\nDoit \u00eatre 3.annul\u00e9 pour r\u00e9ticence le contrat d'assurance dans lequel l'assur\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 n'avoir jamais eu de maladie grave alors qu'il se savait atteint d'une maladie de la moelle \u00e9pini\u00e9re et qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 de la syphilis ; peu importe que la maladie cach\u00e9e par l'assur\u00e9 ait influ\u00e9 ou non sur son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, et peu importe aussi que le medecin d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 par l'assureur ait constat\u00e9 la bonne sant\u00e9 de l'assur\u00e9 ([28]).\nI refer also to re Syndic Lemoine V. La Caisse Paternelle ([29]) where it was held that :\nLe fait par l'assur\u00e9 d'avoir r\u00e9pondu n\u00e9gativement \u00e0 la question de savoir s'il avait eu une maladie assez grave pour n\u00e9cessiter les soins d'un m\u00e9decin, tandis qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 dans l'ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente soign\u00e9 par un m\u00e9decin pour une fluxion de poitrine et pour une phlebite, est une cause de nullit\u00e9 du contrat surtout si la maladie derni\u00e9re cause la mort de l'assur\u00e9, et se rattache pathologiquement aux maladies int\u00e9rieures non d\u00e9clar\u00e9es La dissimulation par I'assur\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 un fait de nature \u00e0 modifier l'opinion du risque, est une cause de nullit\u00e9 alors m\u00eame qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise par ignorance ou de bonne foi.\nUnder our code, by arts. 2487 and 2490, misrepresentation either by error or by design is expressly declared to be a cause of nullity. So that these decisions have a direct application to the present case.\nI am of opinion to dismiss the appeal with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The appeal must, in my opinion, be dismissed. The policy is effected by Langlois and is expressly made \" upon the representations, agreements and stipulations\" contained in the application for policy signed by him. Divers of these representations are admitted to be absolutely false, so that if the personal representatives of Langlois, who was the assured, were the plaintiffs they must have been declared to be void as obtained by the fraud and falsehood of the assured. The fact that by the policy the money payable thereunder is to be paid to Venner according to his rights thereto as a creditor of Langlois does not make Venner to be the person with whom the contract contained in the policy was made. The contract is with Langlois, the assured, and Venner can claim in no other right than as his assignee and as in his right and as the personal representatives of Langlois could not recover by reason of Langloi's fraud attending the procuring of the policy, neither can Venner.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Amyot, Pelletier & Fontaine.\nSolicitors for respondent '.

Q.\u2014Completion of railway line\u2014Evidence of\u2014Onus probandi on defendant.\nA municipal corporation, under the authority of a by-law, issued and handed to the Treasurer of the Province of Quebec $50 000 of its debentures as a subsidy to a railway company, the same to be paid over to the company in the manner and subject to the same conditions in which the Government provincial subsidy was payable under 44 and 45 Vic, ch. 2, sec. 19, viz., \" when the road was completed and in good running order to the satisfaction of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\"\nThe debentures were signed by S. M. who was elected Warden and took and held possession of the office after the former Warden had verbally resigned the position.\nIn an action brought by the railway company to recover from the Treasurer of the Province the $50000 debentures after the Government bonus had been paid and in which action the municipal corporation was mise en cause as a co-defendant, the Provincial Treasurer pleaded by demurrer only, which was overruled, and the County of Pontiac pleaded general denial and that the debentures were illegally signed.\nHeld.\u20141st, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the debentures signed by the Warden de facto were perfectly legal.\n2nd. That as the Provincial Treasurer had admitted by his pleadings that the road had been completed to the satisfaction of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, the onus was on the municipal corporation, mise en cause, to prove that the Government had not acted in conformity with the statute. Strong J. dissenting. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe respondent's action was to recover from the Treasurer of the Province of Quebec $50,000 worth of municipal debentures of the appellant, which, it is alleged, had been deposited with the said Treasurer as trustee both for appellant and a certain railway company known as the Pontiac Pacific Junction Railway Company. The debentures had been granted to the company under a by-law passed the 14th September, 1881, and were to be handed over to the company as the construction of the road progressed in the County of Pontiac, to wit, at the rate of $2,500 per mile, at the completion of every ten miles of road, \" and in the manner and subject to the same conditions in which the bonus payable under the Act passed at the last Session of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec (1880-81) is to be paid to the said company \";\u2014The company transferred the right to obtain the bonus from the Treasurer to plaintiff who alleged in his declaration that the said railway company had con-formed with the conditions of the by-law and had built within the County of Pontiac more than twenty miles of said railway, which have been completed and \"admitted to be in good running order, to the satisfaction of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council.\"\nAppellant's pleas to the action were as follows :\u2014\n1. D\u00e9fense en faits.\n2. An exception setting forth that the said debentures are and have always been illegal, null and void, as not having been issued in conformity with the said by-law or the municipal code, and because, amongst other reasons at the time they were issued and handed to the Treasurer of the Province Simon McNally who signed them, was not Warden of the County of Pontiac and had no authority to sign them, that W.J. Poupore was then such Warden, and alone had authority or power to sign such debentures, and, although in fact McNally appears to have acted, Poupore was the real Warden and in possession of the office as such.\nThe Provincial Treasurer pleaded to the action. by demurrer only, which was overruled.\nAt the trial it appeared by the minutes of the council that at a special session of the council Warden Poupore refused to sign the debentures and verbally tendered his resignation; \"in order to let some other gentleman carry out the behest of the council in signing the debentures, \"and that at a subsequent special session of the council Warden Poupore's resignation was accepted, and Mayor McNally was elected to sign the debentures, which he did.\nThe Government Engineer Light was examined as a witness and proved that he had made a report upon the completion of the road, and that he had given a certificate that the road was complete and in good running order, so far as the specifications of the Province would require.\nThe Government subsidies were paid.\nF. Langelier, Q.C., and McDougcdl for appellant.\nThe appellant was only bound to hand over its debentures when the road or certain sections of it shall have been completed and in good running order to the satisfaction of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. Plaintiff admits this to be so, as it forms the subject matter of one of the allegations of his declaration.\nNow the only legal manner in which such proof could have been adduced would have been by the production of an Order in Council establishing the \" satisfaction of the Lieutenant Governor in Council but no Order in Council is produced. On the contrary, plaintiff relies solely upon the testimony of Mr. Light, engineer acting for the Government of the Province of < Quebec, who swears that he gave a certificate to the effect that twenty miles of said. road. had. been completed, &c., &c., after an inspection he made of it. In cross-examination, he admits that a small portion was, at the time, uncompleted, but that should be set off by work of another kind not called for, but which had been performed.\nCould the company receive any amount of the bonus (subsidy) from the Government until the Lieutenant-Governor in Council be satisfied? Certainly not, according to the statute. The appellant, being in the same position as the Government in that respect, is not yet bound, and the plaintiff's action is not only un-proved, but premature, as it is to be inferred that the non-production of an Order in Council means that no such order exists. Stadacona lus. Co. v. Trudel ([1]); Pacquet v. Gaspard ([2]).\nBesides, under our law, if the county, mise en cause, or the defendant had not filed an appearance when sued, and let the case go by default, the plaintiff could not have obtained judgment without proving by production of the Order in Council that the portions of the road involved in the action had been duly completed, &c, to the satisfaction of the Lieutenant-Governor. But the Court below rules that, having appeared and filed a defence in which all the matters set forth in the plaintiff's claim are expressly denied, appellant by such fact is placed in a worse position than if it had made de-fault. Appellant respectfully urges that the holding is erroneous and subversive of our notions of procedure and evidence.\nArt. 144 of the Code of Procedure relied on by the Court of Queen's Bench will hardly bear the interpretation put upon it. It simply requires an express denial of the facts, and in this instance appellant could assuredly not make a stronger denegation than by alleging that \" all and every, &c., the facts, maters and things set forth in the declaration are false \" which naturally includes the allegation that the road was complete \"to the satisfaction, &c., &c.\" Would the denegation be any stronger by singling out some special fact set up, and stating that such fact \"is specially and expressly false?\" Appellant believes not, and maintains that its general denial is the proper and sufficient pleading, and that special averments are only required in affirmative pleadings.\nOne of the learned judges (Mr. Justice Cross) states, however, in his reasons or notes, that this point is a new issue, and was raised in appeal only.\nThe learned judge is manifestly in error here, as a reference to Mr. Justice Caron's remarks and judgment in the court of original jurisdiction will show that the point was there raised, and passed upon by the tribunal. The plaintiff, at the hearing in the Superior Court, could have applied for a re-opening of the case, in order to produce the Order in Council, but did not do so, and argued that the case was proved without it. So that he cannot now complain that this is a new issue.\nWe also contend that the bonds are worthless and never could or should legally issue. W. J. Poupore was, on the 14th September, 1881,Warden of Pontiac. By the Municipal Code, Wardens are elected annually, to wit, in March of each year ([3]).\nHis signature is subscribed to the by-law of the 14th September, 1831. The bonds purport to have been signed and delivered on or about the 13th February, 1882. \" Therefore, it would be an unmistakeable fact to any one reading the by-law that W. J. Poupore would still be Warden on the 13th February, 1882, and the only legally qualified functionary who could validly sign bonds unless in the meantime the office of Warden had become vacant by death resignation or other valid cause, and a successor appointed.\nIn the present instance Poupore did not resign. It was held that there is evidence of Poupore's resignation as Warden, but we claim that he did not resign and that it is not shown in the record. The only presumable reason the courts below could have for reaching the conclusion that Poupore had relinquished the office would appear because of what purports to be the minutes of two special sessions of the County Council of Pontiac, at the first of which, held on the 18th January, 1882, Poupore is stated to have said that \" he would rather resign than sign the debentures,\" but at which he did not actually resign and this is not sufficient Art 126, Mun. Code C.L.; Pattison v. Corporation of Bryson ([4]); Paris v. Couture ([5]), etc.\nBut respondent meets appellant's argument by a special answer, affirming that McNally was at all events the de facto officer and agent of the Corporation, appellant, and that his act, that of signing the bonds, would make them binding upon the county.\nBut such pretensions can hardly avail against the fact that there was no vacancy in the Wardenship, and that there could be but one Warden to wit, W. J. Poupore. How could McNally be a de facto officer at a period when there existed a real, a de jure officer? Poupore's refusal to sign the bonds, if that were in issue, would not give a right to appoint McNally. He, Poupore, could be compelled by action to sign such bonds, or under art. 251 he could regularly be removed from office, and somebody else legally appointed to sign them.\nIf there was no vacancy there could be no valid election, and all the proceedings surrounding McNally's pretended appointment are bad.\nGrant on the Law of Corporations ([6]); Dillon's Municipal Corporations ([7]).\nIrvine Q.C. and D. Ross Q.C. for respondent.\nThe proceedings of the council show that Poupore, who had been the warden, voluntarily resigned his office, and that his resignation was accepted, and that a regularly convened meeting for the purpose of electing his successor having been called, McNally was duly elected in his place, and took and held possession of the office without any objection, until the expiration of the term when he was re-elected and has been Warden ever since.\nEven if there were any technical defect in the election of McNally, he being in the possession of the office of Warden, and recognized as such by the council his acts in that capacity would. bind the corporation towards third parties.\nThe corporation of Pontiac have no interest in urging this objection now. They themselves placed these bonds in the hands of the treasurer to be handed to the company on the fulfilment of the conditions imposed by the by-law. These conditions have been complied with and the company are entitled to have them. If they are null by reason of any irregularity it will be time enough for the county corporation to urge it when they are called upon to pay them.\nIt was urged at the hearing before the Court of Appeals that there was no evidence of an Order of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council accepting the road This pretension was overruled by the court, on the ground that the fact of the adoption of such Order in C Council was not specially put in issue. (Art. 144, 0. TO C.P.) Moreover, there is ample evidence that the road \" is completed, and it was for the appellant to prove that the Government had not complied with the statute.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that the debentures were perfectly valid, even assuming that they were signed by a warden who was merely such de facto, and had not a strictly legal right to the office, and consequently that the peremptory exemption pleaded by the mise en cause was ill-founded and therefore properly dismissed.\nUpon the other point in the case I think the appellants' contention must be sustained and that the appeal must be allowed.\nThe debentures were, according to the express provisions of the by-law, under which they were issued, to be deposited in the hands of the Provincial Treasurer who was to hold them as trustee for the appellants and for the railway company, and was to hand the same to the company as the work of construction of the railway should progress within the limits of the appellants' county \"in the manner and subject to the same conditions in which the bonus payable under the act passed at the last session of the legislature of the Province of Quebec was to be paid to the said company.\"\nBy the Provincial Statute of Quebec 44 and 45 Vic., ch. 2, sec. 19, the Government bonus was only to be paid when certain sections of the railway had been completed, and were in good running order to the satisfaction of the Lieutenant Governor in Council.\nThe respondent in his declaration has distinctly alleged a compliance with the terms of the condition upon which alone the principal defendant in the action, the Provincial Treasurer who held the bonds upon the trusts mentioned could have been warranted in handing them over to the railway company or its cessionaries, namely, the completion of the prescribed section of the railway to the satisfaction of the Lieutenant Governor in Council. The allegation in the declaration is in these words: \"That the said Pacific Junction Railway have conformed with the condition of the said by-law and have built within the said county of Pontiac more than twenty miles of the said railway which has been completed and admitted to be in good running order to the satisfaction of the Lieutenant Governor in Council.\"\nThe appellants having pleaded the general issue (de-fense au fonds en fait) have thereby put every material allegation to be found in the action in issue and this allegation of completion to the Lieutenant Governor's satisfaction amongst others.\nIt was therefore incumbent on the respondent to prove his allegations and amongst others this allegation of the performance of a condition which was an essential preliminary of his right to demand the de-livery of the debentures.\nI am unable to assent to the respondent's contention that it was for the appellants to prove that the approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council never was in fact obtained. The burden of proof in this as in all cases Where it is expressly stipulated that liability to payment for work done under a contract, is not to arise until a third person has expressed approval of the works as in the common cases of architects and engineers' certificates under railway construction or build-ing contracts, was on the person claiming to be entitled to payment, and I can see no difference in this respect between this case and those referred to. It is true that the direct relief sought by the action is against the treasurer, but inasmuch as the latter is a mere trustee, depositor or shareholder, and as the parties substantially interested are the appellants, there is no reason why the ordinary rules as to the burden of proof should not apply in their favour. Further, I cannot agree that any admission by the treasurer should prejudice or in any way affect the appellants who have been properly put in cause as the parties really interested.\nMr. Justice Cross as appears from the judgment de-livered by him in the Court of Appeals, seems to have considered that this point of the defect in the respondent's case arising from the absence of proof that the Lieutenant Governor in Council had expressed satisfaction with the work, had not been taken in the court of first instance but from the judgment of Mr. Justice Caron, before whom the cause was originally heard, it is apparent that this was a misapprehension for the latter learned judge expressly mentions this point as having been insisted upon before him.\nIt is therefore reduced to a single question, does this record contain evidence that the Lieutenant Governor in Council had (in the words of the statute which were referentially introduced into the by-law) expressed his satisfaction that the portion of the railway in the County of Pontiac had been completed and that the same was in good running order?\nThe only evidence adduced in any way bearing on this question of the Lieutenant Governor's approval, is the report of Mr. Light, the government engineer and his deposition confirmatory of what is there stated, and the fact that the Government bonus was paid over to the railway company. It is manifest that the engineer's approval cannot be substituted for that of the Lieutenant Governor in Council, to do this would be to alter the contract of the parties. As regards the fact that the Government bonus was paid over, it does not appear that this payment was made in pursuance of any order in council or other formal act of the Lieutenant Governor in Council. The essential fact that the railway had been completed and was in running order to the satisfaction of the Lieutenant Governor should in order to comply with the terms of the contract, have been proved in some other way than by mere presumption or inference What the appellants contracted for was a formal expression of satisfaction, for this is indicated by the requirement that it was to be by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, and the proper way of establishing this would have been by showing that it was em-bodied in some order or declaration in council or other appropriate act of state. To imply an approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council from other facts and circumstances is not sufficient, inasmuch as the contract requires an express and formal executive act for which no equivalent can be substituted without imposing upon the appellants terms which they never agreed to. Had there been any actual approval in council it would have been susceptible of the easiest kind of proof by merely putting in a copy of the order certified by the clerk of the Executive Council, and in the absence of such proof it is therefore reasonable to infer that the sanction of the Lieutenant Governor was never obtained. It has been suggested that this is a mere formal and technical objection, but 1 cannot regard it as such; the appellants are only insisting on the fulfilment of the terms for which they stipulated as a condition of the grant made by them in aid of the railway, and experience has shown that public bodies such as the appellants cannot he too careful in guarding the interests of their constituents by clauses such as that contained in this by-law, and in exacting a strict compliance with the conditions on which they grant pecuniary aid to railways.\nTherefore, concurring in the opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Tessier in the Court of Queen's Bench, my judgment must be for allowing this appeal.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by\nTASCHEREAU J.: As to the second plea that the debentures were illegal, we are unanimously of opinion that it is altogether unfounded in law. The proceeding's of the council show that Poupore, who had been the Warden, voluntarily re-signed his office, and that his resignation was accepted, and that a regularly convened meeting for the purpose of electing his successor having been called, McNally was duly elected in his place, and took and held possession of the office without any objection, until the expiration of the term when he was re-elected and has been \"Warden ever since. The debentures signed by the warden de facto are perfectly legal, and the two judgments of the courts below declaring them to be so are unassailable.\nThe appellant, at the hearing, strongly urged the objection that the respondent, not having proved that by an Order in Council this road had been admitted to be in good running order, the action should on that ground alone be dismissed, on the general issue.\nI do not see anything in this contention. First the statute does not mention an Order in Council The fact that the Government bonus has been paid is, it seems to me, sufficient evidence that the road must have been completed to the satisfaction of the Lieu-tenant -Governor in Council. That bonus was payable only when the road was so completed, and we must assume, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that the Government acted in conformity with the statute.\nSecondly, it is in evidence that at a meeting of the municipal council held on the 8th September, 1886, they passed a resolution containing in effect the following '.\u2014\n\" \"Whereas, this Council has always considered and still considers the said pretended debentures to be worthless illegal, null, void, and in no way binding upon this corporation, and that they should be quashed and annulled by the courts, the Warden be and he is immediately authorised to retain counsel and to instruct them to take such steps as may be necessary to have said pretended debentures set aside and declared nulle; that the Treasurer of this Province be requested by the Warden not to hand over to the said company any portion of the said pretended debentures until their legality shall have been decided upon by the courts.\nNow this resolution which was served on the Provincial Treasurer, contains an implied admission by the appellant that the only objection against the transfer of these debentures by the Provincial Treasurer to the company was the illegality of the said debentures, and that the road must then have been completed to the satisfaction of the Lieutenant-Goveenor in Council.\nThirdly.\u2013On this record itself, the Provincial Treasurer, a co-defendant with the appellant, has unequivocally admitted that the road had been completed to the satisfaction of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, by the fact that his only plea to the respondents' action was a demurrer which has been overruled. So that judgment must now necessarily go against him, ordering him to deliver over the said debentures to the respondent.\nI do not lose sight of the fact that this is an admission by another party to the case on a separate issue, but the corporation here is not in the position of an ordinary co-defendant, but only a mise en cause. No condemnation whatever can go against the said corporation. They as mise en cause could have been admitted to prove that the admissions of the Provincial Treasurer had been erroneously or fraudulently given, and that it was not true that this railway had been completed to the satisfaction of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. with these admissions of the only real defendant on the record, on them, the mise en cause laid the burden of proving their contentions. It is wrong for the Corporation to say that if they had not appeared and pleaded to the action the plaintiff would have had to prove the completion of the road to the satisfaction of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. If the Corporation had not appeared and pleaded to the action, judgment on the merits would have gone against the Treasurer immediately on the overruling of his demurrer.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants : J.

(1887) c. 184 ss. 524, 531.\nH. was owner of, and resided on, a lot in the eighth concession of the Township of McG. and under the provisions of C.S.U.C., c. 54, an allowance was granted by the Township for a road in front of said lot. This road was, however, never opened owing to the difficulties caused by the formation of the land, and a by-law was passed authorising a new road in substitution thereof. Some years after H. brought a suit to compel the township to open the original road or, in the alternative, to provide him with access to his lot, and also to keep said road in repair and pay damages for injuries caused by the road not having been opened.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the provisions of the act, C.S.U.C., c. 54, requiring a township to maintain and keep in repair roads, etc., and prohibiting the closing or alteration of roads, only applied to roads which had been formally opened and used and not to those which a township, in its discretion, has considered it inadvisable to open.\nHeld also, that the courts of Ontario have no jurisdiction to compel a municipality, at the suit of a private individual, to open an original road allowance and make it fit for public travel.\nAPPEAL from the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division[2] in favor of the township.\nThis suit was instituted in 1885, and in his statement of claim the plaintiff alleges, in substance, that he has been for many years owner in fee of lot number eight in the sixth concession of the township of McGillivray,\u2014that the original allowance for road in that concession was in front of his lot and that he had no access to his lot over any other public road\u2014that defendants had stopped up said road and prevented him from having access to his lot by means thereof\u2014that he has been excluded from such access for many years without any compensation therefor or being supplied with other means of access to his land\u2014that defendants have not maintained said road, as was their duty\u2014that they from time to time promised to maintain and repair it but have always neglected so to do\u2014that they frequently promised him compensation for closing said road but he has never received the same; and he prayed\n1. Compensation and damages.\n2. An injunction compelling defendants to open said road or provide other means of access to his land.\n3. An injunction compelling defendants to repair said road; and\n4. General relief.\nBy the statement of defence it was alleged that plaintiff was owner of the east half of lot seven in the seventh concession of the township\u2014that the road in front of plaintiff\u2019s lot had never been opened in consequence of natural and physical difficulties rendering it impossible or, at all events, practically impossible from the great expense it would have involved\u2014that it would not have been an honest exercise of their discretion to open the road under the circumstances\u2014that another road was opened in lieu of the said road which is available to plaintiff in going to and from his lot\u2014that plaintiff acquiesced in the substitution of the new road and accepted the same in lieu of any right he might have in respect to the original allowance\u2014that plaintiff has other means of access to his lot\u2014that defendants have offered to construct a roadway from the new road to plaintiff\u2019s lot which he refused to accept\u2014and defendants submitted that it was entirely in their discretion whether the road should have been opened or not and the exercise, in good faith, of such discretion could not be reviewed by the court.\nBy his reply the plaintiff admitted that he had means of access to his land, but averred a large expenditure in order to procure the same. He also admitted defendant\u2019s offer to provide him a roadway, but alleged that they always neglected to do so. Subject to these admission issue was joined.\nOn the trial of the action the jury found that defendants had the financial ability to open the original road and that it could have been made fit for travel without encroaching on adjoining lands\u2014that it would have been a reasonable expenditure of public money to make it fit for travel\u2014that from default of defendants the plaintiff had not a convenient means of access to his lot\u2014that defendants should have opened the road, but they acted in good faith in determining not to do so; and they awarded plaintiff $1. damages.\nJudgment was entered for the plaintiff, but was set aside on motion to the Divisional Court[3], Wilson C.J. being of opinion that the plaintiff had not made out a case for the relief he asked, and Armour J. that the discretion of a municipal council in such a case could not be interfered with and that, under any circumstances, plaintiff\u2019s only remedy would be by indictment of the council. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of the Divisional Court, and the plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nR.M.

RITCHIE C.J.\u2014For the reasons given by the Court of Appeal I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014Concurred in the reasons given by Mr. Justice Gwynne for his decision.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The plaintiff in the year 1850 entered into possession of lot No. 8, in the 6th concession of the township of McGrillivray as the owner thereof in fee simple. At the time of his so entering into posses- sion of the lot the road allowance between the 6th and 7th concessions in front of the adjoining lot No. 7, by reason of a steep hill in that part of the said road allowance, was and still is utterly impassable except on foot, and no work has ever been done upon it. In front of lot No. 9, also, there was and still is another steep hill. The plaintiff and his brother, who owns lot No. 9, prior to 1862 constructed for their own convenience, with some rough timbers, what is called a corduroy bridge, across a stream which crosses the road allowance in front of lot No. 9, so as to make a footpath across the stream, and they also cut away a little piece of the hill on the east side so that a person could walk up and down the hill. The road allowance between those two hills in front of plaintiff\u2019s lot, No. 8, is comparatively level, so that if the two hills should be cut down, and the lowlands at their base filled up to the level of the road allowance in front of lot No. 8, a reasonably fair road could be made which would give free access to the plaintiff\u2019s lot; but the execution of such work would have been so difficult and expensive that the municipal council of the township, in the year eighteen hundred and sixty\u2011two, because of the great difficulty and expense attending the making the road allowance in front of those lots fit for travel passed a by-law in virtue of which they constructed a road across part of the east half of lot No. 7 and across lots Nos. 8 and 9 and part of lot No. 10 in the seventh concession of the said township, and which is described in the by\u2011law by metes and bounds and is stated to be in place of the original allowance for road between the sixth and seventh concessions, that is, in place of that part of such road allowance which lies between the terminal points of the new road. (His Lordship then set out the substance of the pleadings[17] and proceeded as follows).\nNow, by the issues thus joined, the plaintiff\u2019s case appears to be reduced to a claim by him for compensation in damages for monies alleged to have been expended by him in providing himself with means of access between his said lot No. 8 and the new road opened by the defendants by by-law as alleged in their statement of defence, or as alternative relief in lieu of such compensation, or to speak more correctly, by way of compelling the defendants to render to the plaintiff such compensation, that the defendants may be compelled (for the sole convenience of the plaintiff, and as the plaintiff insists that the defendants, notwithstanding the opening of the new road, are still in law bound) to open, and to maintain fit for travel, that part of the said original road allowance which lies between the terminal points of the new road, so as to give thereby access to the plaintiff\u2019s lot No. 8, which he could not have along such original road allowance so long as that part of it is left in its natural state. At the trial a large field of enquiry was entered upon, and questions were submitted to the jury by the learned judge who tried the case which, in the view which I take, appear to me to be not very material to the determination of the case. It did, however, appear upon the evidence of the plaintiff himself that very shortly after the opening of the new road under the by-law of 1862 he purchased the east half of the adjoining lot No. 7, for the purpose of obtaining thereby access between his lot No. 8 and the original allowance for road between the 6th and 7th concessions of the township, close to the place where the new road is made, to diverge from the original road allowance and enter upon the east half of lot No. 7, in the 7th concession. It also appeared that about the same time the council of the township offered to acquire and give to the plaintiff a road from the new road across lot No. 8, in the 7th concession, to his lot No. 8 in the 6th concession, near the place where the north-westerly extremity of that lot abuts on the original allowance for road between the said 6th and 7th concessions. The witnesses for the defendant allege that the plaintiff at first agreed, and afterwards refused, to accept this road. The plaintiff admits that the offer was made to him, but says that he insisted upon having given to him also a road along the length of his lot No. 8, and the lot to the south of him to the next concession allowance for road to the south, which I understand to be the road between the 4th and 5th concessions. Being asked if the township did not afterwards offer to give him, as he was not satisfied with the road offered to him through lot No. 8 in the 7th concession, a road along the rear of lots Nos. 9 and 10, to a side line running along lot 10, he answered \u201cyes;\u201d and being asked if he had agreed to take that road, he answered \u201cyes.\u201d Lot No. 9 belonged to plaintiff\u2019s brother, lot 10 to one Charlton. It appeared also in evidence that the township council agreed with Charlton for a road three rods in width across his lot for $46, and a deed of the land to the municipality was prepared for execution by him, but the plaintiff prevented the execution thereof by intervening and purchasing from Charlton a road of two rods in width, which the plaintiff and his brother have ever since used. Now, as to this road, the clearest evidence was given that the plaintiff had agreed to accept it, and afterwards intervened to prevent its being acquired for him by the municipality.\nHaving been asked, \u201cif he did not, after agreeing with the township to take a road through Chariton\u2019s lot, go and buy the road himself behind the township\u2019s back,\u201d he answered, \u201cyes.\u201d And being asked, \u201cwhether that was not done by him in order to prevent the township giving him that road,\u201d he answered, \u201cyes, to be sure it was, it was not much of a road, any how.\u201d But the question having been repeated, if he had not agreed to take it, he answered, \u201cyes.\u201d\nIt is then abundantly clear that the plaintiff has provided himself with access to his lot No. 8, which the township were willing and offered to give him at their expense, and which, after having agreed to accept, he himself intervened to prevent their acquiring and giving to him.\nThe question now is whether, under these circumstances, the plaintiff is entitled to the relief prayed for in his statement of claim or to any relief. The answer to this question must depend upon the provisions of the Municipal Institutions Act, ch. 54 of the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, the statute which was in force affecting the matters in issue when the new road was opened under the by-law of the municipality passed in 1862. Under the 315th section of this act the municipal council of the township of McGrillivray had jurisdiction over the original road allowances within the municipality, subject to certain provisions in the act contained.\nThe only provisions affecting the case now under consideration are those mentioned in the 318th and 321st sections, by the former of which it was enacted that no council should close up any original road allowance (or other roads) whereby any person should be excluded from ingress and egress to and from his lands and place of residence over such road, but that all such roads should remain open for the use of the persons who require the same. This section, as its language, plainly as it appears to me, intimates, refers only to original road allowances, or other roads which had already been opened, and which, therefore, should remain open for the use of the person whose lands abutted thereon.\nBy the 321st section it was enacted that no council should pass a by-law for the stopping up, widening, diverting or selling any original road allowance, or for establishing, opening, stopping up, &c., &c., or selling any other public highway, road, &c., &c., until certain notices of the intended by-law should be published in a manner prescribed in the act. By the 330th and 331st sections the council of every township municipality was empowered to pass by\u2011laws, among other things, for enforcing the performance of statute labor, or a commutation in money in lieu thereof\u2014for regulating the manner and the divisions in which statute labor or commutation money should be performed or expended\u2014for opening, making, preserving, improving, repairing, &c., &c., roads, &c., &c., within the jurisdiction of the council, subject to certain restrictions in the act contained\u2014for selling an original road allowance to the parties next adjoining whose lands the same is situated when a public road has been opened in lieu of the original road allowance, and for the site or line of which compensation has been paid\u2014and for selling, in like manner, to the owners of any adjoining land any road legally stopped up or altered by the council; and in case such persons respectively should refuse to become the purchasers at such price as the council should think reasonable then for the sale thereof to any other person for the same or a greater price. The first part of this sub-section appears to refer to the case of a new road opened by the municipality in lieu of an original road allowance or a part of an original road allowance, which had never been opened and made fit for public travel, and the second part to roads which had been opened but which should be legally stopped up or altered by the council; then by the 333rd section it was enacted that in case a person is in possession of any part of a Government allowance for road laid out adjoining his lot and enclosed by a lawful fence and which has not been opened for public use by reason of another road being used in lieu thereof, or is in possession of any Government allowance for road parallel or near to which a road has been established by law in lieu thereof, such person shall be deemed to be legally possessed thereof, as against any private person until a by-law has been passed for opening such allowance for road by the council having jurisdiction over the same; but by the 334th section no such by-law should be passed until notice in writing should be given to the person in possession, at least eight days before the meeting of the council, that an application will be made for opening such allowance. Then by the 337th section it was enacted that every public road, street, bridge and highway in a municipality shall be kept in repair by the corporation, and that the default of the corporation so to keep in repair shall be a misdemeanor punishable by fine in the discretion of the court, and that the corporation shall be further civilly responsible for all damages sustained by any person by reason of such default but the action must be brought within three months after the damages have been sustained. Then by the 343rd section it was enacted that the council of every township might pass by-laws for the stopping up and sale of any original allowance for road or any part thereof within the municipality and for fixing and declaring therein the terms upon which the same may be sold and conveyed, but no such by-law shall have any force unless passed in accordance with the three hundred and twenty-first section of the act, nor until confirmed by a by-law of the council of the county in which the township is situate, at an ordinary session of the county council, but no sooner than three months nor later than one year after the passing thereof.\nThese are the only sections of the act affecting the plaintiff\u2019s rights as they stood when the new road was opened under the by-law of 1862, and from them it sufficiently, I think, appears that after the opening of the new road under the by-law of 1862, in substitution for the impracticable part of the original concession road allowance in front of lots 7, 8 and 9, which had never been opened, the municipality could not have been compelled at the suit of the plaintiff to pass a by-law for the opening of, or to open, the said piece of the said original road allowance in lieu of which the new road had been opened.\nIf any direct injury resulted to a private individual from any obstruction placed in a public travelled highway, whether on land or on water, which injury was other and greater than that occasioned to, or suffered by, the general public, the person so injured had his remedy by action at common law for damages, and in equity by injunction to restrain the continuance of the obstruction causing the injury. There is no lack of cases which establish this proposition. But that is a jurisdiction very different from that of a court assuming to dictate to a municipality established under the Municipal Institutions Acts from time to time in force in that part of Canada, formerly constituting the Province of Upper Canada, now the Province of Ontario, the times when, the places where, and the manner in which the council of the municipality should exercise its legislative jurisdiction over the original road allowances placed under their control. Hitherto no jurisdiction has ever been asserted by any court in that part of Canada now constituting the Province of Ontario to compel any one of the municipalities existing therein, at the suit of a private individual, to open an original road allowance, and to make it fit for being travelled upon as a public highway, and, in my opinion, no such jurisdiction exists in any court save under and in virtue of the jurisdiction conferred by ch. 23 of the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, and which is now exercised by the High Court of Justice for Ontario, whereby a plaintiff may obtain a judgment, in an action instituted at his suit, for a writ of mandamus to issue commanding the defendant to fulfil any duty in the fulfilment of which the plaintiff is personally interested.\nWhen the council of the municipality of the Township of McGillivray passed the by-law of 1862, and opened thereunder the new road which was substituted for that part of the original road allowance which was, in the opinion of the council, impracticable and unsuitable for a public highway, they were acting in the legitimate exercise of the jurisdiction vested in them by statute, and thereupon the new road so opened assumed the place of the piece of the original road allowance in lieu of which it was opened, and the municipality became subjected to the duty of maintaining and repairing it in the place and stead of the piece of the original road allowance for which the new road was substituted, and was authorized by the statute to sell, by a by-law to be passed for the purpose, the piece of the original road allowance to the owners of the adjoining lands of which the plaintiff was one; such owners, moreover, might have enclosed the half opposite to their respective lots, and have retained possession thereof against all persons, unless and until a by-law should be passed by the council for opening the same, which by-law could not be passed without notice to the persons in possession. I have already said that, in my opinion, an original road allowance which never had been opened did not come within the above 318th sec. of chapter 54 of the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada\u2014that such section applied only to roads which had been opened and by which a person had had access to his land, of which access the section enacted that he should not be deprived, but that, notwithstanding the opening of a new road in the place of the old, the latter by which any person had had access to his lands should remain open for the like purpose; but assuming that section to apply to the case of a part of an original road allowance, like that in question here, which never had been opened, but in substitution for which, because of its unsuitability for a public highway by reason of natural obstacles existing there, a new road had been opened under a by-law, the council never has as yet assumed to exercise any jurisdiction or right to close it. It remains still in its former condition unless it has been taken possession of and enclosed by the respective owners of land fronting upon it, as it might have been under the statute which, it is moreover to be observed, imposed no obligation upon the municipality to provide other access for the plaintiff to his lot. This want of such a provision in the statute appears to have been considered a defect for the legislature in 1873, in the Consolidated Municipal Institutions Act of that year, 36 Vic., ch. 48, imposed a restriction upon the right of the municipality to close up any public road or highway by the 422nd section of that act by which it was enacted as follows:\u2014\nNo council shall close up any public road or highway whether an original allowance or a road opened by the Quarter Sessions or any municipal council, or otherwise legally established, whereby any person will be excluded from ingress and egress to and from his lands or place of residence over such road, unless the council, in addition to compensation, shall also provide for the use of such person some other convenient road or way of access to his said lands or residence. And this section has been further amended by sec. 544 of ch. 184 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario of 1887 which, in addition to the above re-enacted verbatim, enacts as follows:\u2014\nIf the compensation offered by the council to the owner of the lands, or the road provided for the owner in lieu of the original road as a means of ingress or regress, is not mutually agreed upon between the council and the owner or owners, as the case may be, then in such case the matters in dispute shall be referred to arbitration under the provisions of this act respecting arbitration.\nNow, the only duty or obligation owed by a municipality in respect of these road allowances within its jurisdiction is such duty and obligation as has been imposed and is regulated by the Municipal Institutions Acts for the time being in force, and that duty or obligation is owed to the general public. It may be admitted that the plaintiff in the present case, as the owner of a lot of land fronting on the piece in question of the original concession road allowance, has a personal interest in the fulfilment of whatever duty, if any, still remains imposed by statute upon the municipality of the township of McGrillivray in relation to such part of the said original road allowance in the interest of the general public; but apart from such duty, if any, so imposed, the township municipality owes no duty to the plaintiff or to any one in respect of such road allowance. The plain result, as it appears to me, of what has been done by the municipality under statutory authority is, that upon the opening of the new road under the by\u2011law of 1862, in lieu of that piece of the original concession road allowance between the 6th and 7th concession of the township of McGillivray which, in the opinion of the council of the municipality, was wholly unsuitable for being opened as a public highway, the municipality ceased to owe and does not now owe any duty to any person to open that part of the said original road allowance for which they have provided a new road by way of substitution; and as the statute, under which the municipality proceeded, imposed no obligation upon them to render any compensation to the plaintiff under the circumstances he is not in a position to maintain an action for damages or any other relief against the municipality. The piece of road allowance in question, although it never has been opened, has never been closed by the municipality; it remains still in the condition it always has been, and if sec. 544 of ch. 184 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, of 1887, applies to an original road allowance which never has been opened, and if the council of the municipality should ever pass a by-law to close the piece in question, the plaintiff may perhaps then be able to claim \u201ccompensation and also some other convenient road or way of access to his said lands and residence\u201d in the words of that section; but in such case in the event of any difference arising between the plaintiff and the municipality upon the matter it would have to be settled by arbitration under the provisions of the act, ch. 184, and not by action; the relief provided by sec. 544 is incidental only to the closing of a public road or highway by a municipality which can be done only by a by-law to be passed for the purpose under the provisions of the statute in that behalf.\nIt was suggested, but hardly argued and, indeed, it could not well be contended, that the injury to his land of which the plaintiff complains comes within the 531st sec. of the above ch. 184, which enacts that\nevery public road, street, bridge or highway shall be kept in repair by the corporation, and on default of the corporation so to keep in repair the corporation shall, besides being subject to any punishment provided by law, be civilly responsible for all damages sustained by any person by reason of such default, but the action must be brought within three months after the damages have been sustained. But if the municipality is, under the circumstances above set forth, under no obligation to open the piece of road allowance in question, the latter cannot be a piece of road or highway which, under this section, they are bound to keep in repair.\nWhether an indictment could be sustained in any case against a municipality under this section as for default in keeping in repair an original road allowance which had never been opened for travel it is unnecessary to determine, for it appears, I think, to be clear that the damage of which the plaintiff complains is not damage within the meaning of this section, namely, \u201cdamage sustained by reason of such default.\u201d The damage to the plaintiff\u2019s land of which he complains has always existed,\u2014it arises from the natural conformation of the land at the place in question, and is attributable to that cause, whereas damages sustained by reason of the default of a municipality within the meaning of the 531st sec. of ch. 184 Revised Statutes of Ontario must, as it seems to me, be damages directly attributable to a cause of damage occasioned by the default of the corporation and for the existence of which cause they are therefore responsible.\nFor the above reasons I am of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Meredith & Meredith.\nSolicitors for respondent: Meredith & Cox.\n[1] 15 Ont.

Banc of Toronto (12 App. Cas. 575) and Severn v. The Queen (12 Can. S.C.R. 70,) distinguished.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side) ([1]) confirming a judgment of the Superior Court which had dismissed the appellants s petition for a writ of prohibition. The petition had for its object the obtaining of a writ of prohibition enjoining the recorder's court and the city of Montreal from proceeding in the case before the said recorder's court, wherein the city of Montreal was complainant and the said appellant defendant. The complaint was to the effect that appellant, a butcher, had illegally exposed for sale on a private stall, outside of the public meat markets, meat ordinarily bought and sold on public meat markets, without having obtained a license from the city council the whole in violation of by-law No. 131, intituled, \"By-law Concerning Markets \" then in force in the city of Montreal l the petition, praying for the writ \u2022 of prohibition, alleged that the by-law, in virtue of which the city of Montreal was proceeding against the appellant, was ultra vires and, consequently, had no legal existence. The Corporation of Montreal answered the petition by pleading that the by-law and the statute upon which it rests are legal and constitutional and valid to all intents and purposes.\nThe by-law and the statute in question are referred to at length in the judgments of the court hereafter given.\nGeoffrion Q.C. and Madore for appellant.\nEven if the statute is intra vires of the legislature the by-law is ultra vires and not authorised by the statute; 1st, because by sec 78 of 39 Vic. ch. 52, the business tax upon butchers is limited to 7\u00bd per cent. and if it had been the intention to impose a tax over and above this business tax the legislature would have said so in special terms; 2nd, because the words \" such sum as may be fixed by such by-law,'' 37 Vic. ch. 51, sec. 123, must be understood as only giving authorisation to impose such fee as will cover the necessary expenses for issuing the license and that. fee has been fixed by sec. 49 of the by-law at $2.00; 3rd, because it imposes upon a certain class of the community a burden of taxation heavier than that of other citizens.\nThe learned counsel cited Dillon (1); Walker v. City of Montreal (1), Cooley on Taxation (1); Cooley on Constitutional Limitations (1) 39 Vie ch. 52 (P.Q.)\nEthier for respondent.\nThere can be no question now as to the constitutionality of the statute.\nAs to the second point raised by the appellant that having paid the 7\u00bd per cent. business tax levied under 39 Vic. ch. 52 he is not bound to pay another tax as a butcher * this tax of 7\u00bd per cent. is a business tax levied on all traders, and the other is a specific duty levied on private butchers' stalls, and the Legislature has conferred in plain terms on the corporation the privilege of exacting and collecting both.\nThe doctrine of inequality of taxation or unreasonableness of taxation has taken rise in England where unincorporated bodies were recognised by the courts when they had held and exercised privileges from time immemorial and their by-laws were acknowledged as binding on the corporators, provided such by-laws were reasonable, uniform and not oppressive. In the United States' constitution there are to be found provisions which have induced the American courts to declare null and void by-laws considered as unequal, unreasonable or unjust. On the contrary, in the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the Local Legislatures have the whole municipal system under their control, and it cannot be presumed by the courts that they exercise that control unreasonably or unjustly. Attorney General v. The City of Montreal (1); Mallette v. City of Montreal (1); Corporation of Three Rivers v. Major (1); Dillon on Corporations (1).\nSir W J RITCHIE C J. concurred with. TASCHEREATU J .\nSTRONG J.\u2014This was a proceeding in prohibition to restrain the recorder's court from proceeding to hear and determine an action instituted by the city of Montreal against the present appellant to recover the fine imposed for an infraction of a by-law of the city, which required all persons exposing meat for sale in any private stall or shop outside of the public meat markets to take out a license for which license the sum of two hundred dollars was, by the same by-law, required to be paid. The appellant who was, at the time of the action being brought, keeping a private stall for the sale of butcher's meat at the corner of St. Denis and St. Catherine streets in the city of Montreal, refused to submit to the by-law and to pay the license fee of $200 for the year from May 1886 to May, 1887.\nThereupon, the city instituted an action in the recorder's court to recover the fine prescribed for breach of the by-law, upon which the appellant took proceedings in Prohibition, making the recorder's court and the city both parties, defendants. A writ to appear and answer having been granted by the Superior Court, the city pleaded thereto, first, a peremptory exception insisting that the appellant was precluded from raising any objection to the by-law imposing the fee for the license inasmuch as the city was entitled to the benefit of the prescription enacted by sec. 12 of 42 and 43 Vic. ch. 53, the period of three months from the date of the passing of the by-law having elapsed before the commencement of the action. Secondly the city pleaded a general defense on the merits insisting on the validity of the by-law and on the constitutionality of the statute pursuant to which it was passed.\nThe appellant having filed an answer and replication the parties went to proof and the cause was subsequently heard before Mr. Justice Mathieu, in the Superior Court, who dismissed it, and the appellant having taken an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench that court affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court. The present appeal was then taken to this court.\nBy the Provincial Statute, 37 Vic. ch. 21, sec. 123, sub-sec. 27, the city of Montreal is authorized\nTo establish and regulate public markets and private butchers' or hucksters' stalls, and to regulate license or restrain the sale of fresh meats, vegetables, fish or other articles usually sold in markets.\nBy sub-sec. 31 of the same section it is enacted that the city shall have power\nTo order that all kinds of live stock, and all kinds of provisions and provender, whatsoever, usually bought and sold in public markets that may be brought to the said city for sale, shall be taken to the public markets of the said city and there exposed, and that neither the said live stock, nor the said provisions or provender, shall be offered or exposed for sale, or to be sold or purchased elsewhere in the said city than on the said public markets; bat the city Council may, if they deem it advantageous, by a by-law to be passed for that purpose, empower any person to sell, offer or expose for sale in any place beyond the limits of said markets or market stalls of the said city meat, vegetables and provisions usually bought and sold on public markets upon such person obtaining a license for that purpose from the said council for which he shall pay to the city Treasurer such sum as may be fixed by such by-law, and by conforming with the rules and regulations contained in the said by-law.\nAnd by sub sec. 32 of the same section further power was given to the city\nTo impose a duty on all private marts in the said city or that may hereafter be established therein for the sale of cattle. provisions or provender or of anything else whatsoever that is usually sold on public markets with power to regulate and fix the said duty as regards each particular mart as the said council may see fit. On the 9th of June 1882 the city Council of Montreal passed a by-law which contained amongst others the following provisions. By section 44 it was enacted that:\u2014\nNo person shall sell or expose for sale in any private stall or shop in the city outside of the public meat markets aforesaid any meat, fish, vegetables or provisions usually bought and sold on public meat markets unless he shall have obtained a license from the said council as before provided.\nSection 45;\nThe said council upon the recommendation of the market committee may from time to time issue license under the hand of the mayor to persons who desire to sell or expose for sale in such private stalls or shops outside of the said public meat markets as shall be designated in such licenses any such meat, fish, vegetables or provisions provided the place so designated be not less than five hundred yards distant from the centre of any of the said public meat markets.\nSection 46;\nFor each and every such license there shall be paid to the city Treasurer by the person applying for the same at the time of his making such application, the sum of $200.\nSection 47;\nAll licenses so issued shall expire on the first day of May after the date thereof unless sooner revoked and shall he renewable every year at the discretion of the said council.\nAnd section 95 of the same by-law was in the words following :\u2014\nAny person violating and contravening any of the provisions of tins by-law, for which a penalty is not hereinbefore provided, shall for each offence be liable to a fine and, in default of immediate payment of said fine and costs, to an imprisonment, the amount of said fine and the term of said imprisonment to be -fixed by the Recorder's Court at its discretion, and any person who shall violate any such pro-vision of the said by-law shall moreover be liable to the penalty mentioned in this section for each and. every day that such violation or contravention shall last which shall be held to be a distinct and separate offence for each and every day as aforesaid; provided that such fine shall not exceed forty dollars and the imprisonment shall not be for a longer period than two calendar months fox each and every offence as ' Aforesaid ; the said imprisonment, however, to cease at any time before the expiration of the term fixed by the said Recorder's Court upon payment of the said fine and costs\nThe first pretension of the appellant is that sec. 46 of the by-law requiring the payment of $200.00 for a license to sell meat outside the public markets is not authorized by the statute, and is therefore in excess of the powers of the council and absolutely null and void. The argument in support of this proposition is that sub.-sec. 31 of sec 123 of the statute is to be interpreted as conferring powers of police regulations only and not taxing powers; that the sum to be fixed by the by-law as that to be paid for the license is not intended as a tax or impost for revenue purposes, but merely as an indemnity for the expense and trouble of issuing the license; and that the sum of $200 is for that purpose excessive in amount. There is no force whatever in this argument. Had the city council only possessed the police power (and it would have been restricted to that if the mere power to regulate, and for that end to license, had been conferred without any express provision authorizing the exaction of a sum to be paid for the license) there might have been some color for this contention; but when we find the legislature authorizing the city council to impose such charge for the license as it should think reasonable without any reference to the payment being by way of indemnity, as a fee for the trouble and expense involved in issuing the license an interpretation which would restrict the words in which the statute is expressed in the way contended for would be nothing short of legislation and is therefore entirely inadmissible\nThe language of the statute being such as it is it would be impossible for any court, without arrogating to itself the power of revising and controlling the acts of the council, a jurisdiction for which no authority can be derived either from statute or common law, to say that the fee to be paid must be limited in amount to a sum which should appear to the court to be reasonable as a mere remuneration for the labor and expense of issuing the license. Such a construction of the statute is not only not warranted by its language, but would moreover be most objectionable as conferring on a court of justice an unusual and inconvenient jurisdiction which it could never satisfactorily exercise. If, however, the Legislature had itself no authority to confer upon the city council other than police powers, such an interpretation as that just referred to might have been unavoidable, but, as it will appear when we come to consider the constitutional validity of the statute, the Legislature did possess the power not only to authorize the city to regulate, and indeed to prohibit altogether, the sale of meat out of market as an exercise of the police power, but also the power to impose a tax in aid of a revenue for municipal purposes by means of licenses issued to persons upon whom privileges in this respect might be conferred. These considerations lead to the conclusion that it is impossible to say that the words\" for which he shall pay such sum as may be fixed by the by-law,\" are not to be construed in their ordinary, primary meaning as conferring on the city council absolute and unrestricted power and discretion as regards the amount to be paid for the issue of any licenses they may think fit, by a by-law duly passed, to sanction.\nAs regards the objection that the amount required to be paid is so excessive as to be prohibitory the plain answer is in the first place, that it has not been made to appear that it is prohibitory, that there is nothing to show that the advantage to be derived from the privilege of selling out of market may not be such that this license fee is relatively moderate and fair; and in the next place even if the charge were exorbitant and prohibitory the council have power, if they should think it advantageous to the city so to do, to prohibit sales out of market altogether, and having this power they may, if for any reason they choose to do so, exercise it by imposing a license fee so large in amount as to be in effect a prohibition. Further, it may be answered that although it might be an objection to the exercise of a mere power to regulate, excluding all powers not only to prohibit the sale out of market but also to tax by means of licenses for revenue purposes, yet when the power of taxing is conferred it never can be objected to an instance of its exercise that the tax imposed is prohibitory in its operation in all such cases the amount of the tax must rest exclusively in the discretion of the body possessing the power to impose it.\nOn the whole, upon the only admissible interpretation of the statute I conclude that the city Council were by it invested with all the powers they assumed to exercise by the by-law.\nNext it is pretended that the 31st sub-sec, to which the authority of the council to pass the by-law must be ascribed is itself ultra viraus of the Provincial Legislature. It is said that the 92nd section of the British North America Act does not confer on the Provinces the right to invest a municipal council with powers of taxation such as this enactment assumes to confer upon the city of Montreal. The answers to this relied upon by the learned advocates for the city are, I think, clear and conclusive. For myself I prefer to select one of these grounds and to rest my judgment exclusively upon that.\nIt may be that since the decision of the Judicial Committee in the case of Lamb v. The Bunk of Toronto (1), a tax for municipal purposes, to be collected by means of a license imposed upon a person carrying on a specific retail trade as a condition of being permitted to carry it on in a particular manner, or in a particular place as in the present case, is not to be regarded as an instance of indirect taxation If this is so it would of course, be conclusive of the question of legislative authority which has been raised in the present case but, without in the slightest degree presuming to depart from any decision of the Privy Council, I am prepared for the purposes of the present judgment to assume the correctness of the appellant's contention that this is an indirect tax and to deal with the case upon that basis.\nThen looking at the case in this way I have no hesitation in ascribing the authority of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec to pass the provision of the statute now impugned to the 9th sub-section of section 92 of the British North America Act. The words of that section are as follows, \"Shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer, and other licenses, in order to the raising a revenue for provincial, local, or municipal purposes.\" If it were necessary to do so I should be prepared to hold that the words \" other licenses \" include such licenses as the Legislature have empowered the city of Montreal to impose by the terms of the statutes now under consideration. It never has been decided by any court of appeal that the words other licenses\" are to have no meaning whatever, and that the clause is to be restricted to the four named but incongruous cases of \"shops saloons taverns and auctioneers.\" The case of Severn v. The Queen (1) did not decide this but merely determined that a construction which would include licenses to brewers under the words \"other licenses\" was inadmissible for the reason that it would conflict with the exclusive power to regulate trade and commerce which was vested in the Dominion. And even as regards this construction of the 9th sub-sec. if the decision in Severn v. The Queen (1) has not been over-ruled observations not in accordance with it are certainly to be found in the later decisions of the Privy Council. I do not, however, base my opinion on these words other licenses \" being comprehensive of a license tax such as this but on what appears to me to be the indisputable ground, that this is a shop license power to authorize the imposition of which is in so many words conferred on the Provincial Legislatures by sub-sec. 9 of sec. 92. There is nothing in the context restraining the meaning of the word \" shop \" to any particular species of shop, or to a shop in which any specific commodity is dealt in, and that being so there is nothing whatever to exclude from its operation a shop such as that kept by the appellant for the sale of butchers' meat. This seems, by itself, conclusive of the question of constitutional validity, and to preclude all objections to the statute.\nAs to the point that tie by-law imposes double taxation inasmuch as the appellant was in addition to this license tax, liable to pay the general business tax of 7\u00bd per cent. on the annual value of the premises in which he carried on his business, there is manifestly no weight in it either as an independent ground for at-tacking the validity of the by-law, or as having incidentally an influence on the construction which ought to be put upon the statute. The two taxes are imposed on entirely different subjects; one is a personal tax payable for the right to exercise a particular privilege by way of exemption from a general law the other is a general tax in respect of the property upon which any trade or occupation is carried on. The two taxes are, therefore, not identical, and the imposition of both can in no sense be regarded as double taxation.\nIt seems to be extremely doubtful, to say the least, if the writ of prohibition was the appropriate remedy in the present case. That writ is only applicable to restrain an excess of jurisdiction by inferior courts. The recorder's court would not however have exceeded its jurisdiction even though the by-law might have been bad or the statute extra vires if it had proceeded to hear and determine the action instituted by the city. If any court had jurisdiction the recorder's court had it; the appellant's defenses therefore, that the by-law and statute were invalid, did not, strictly speaking, constitute objections to the jurisdiction, but were, rather, objections on the merits to the foundation of the action in point of law\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J. By its charter the city of Montreal is authorized by section 123 sub-sec. 27 to \" establish a and regulate public markets and private butchers' or \" hucksters' stalls * and to regulate license or restrain \" the sale of fresh meats vegetables, fish or other \" articles usually sold on markets; \"\u2014Then, by sub-sec. 31: \"To order that all kinds of live stock and \" all kinds of provisions and provender whatsoever, usually bought and sold in public markets, that may \" be brought to the said city for sale, shall be taken to \" the public markets of the said city and there exposed; a and that neither the said live stock nor the said pro-\" visions nor provender, shall be offered or exposed for \" sale or to be sold or purchased elsewhere in the said ' city, than on the said public markets; but the city council may, if. they deem it advantageous, by a by-\" law to be passed for that purpose, empower any \" person to sell, offer or expose for sale, in any place \" beyond the limits of said markets or market stalls of i the said city, meat, vegetables and provisions usually bought and sold on public markets, upon such person \" obtaining a license for that purpose from the said\" council for which he shall pay to the city treasurer \" such sum as may be fixed by such by-law, and by c conforming with the rules and regulations contained i in the said by-law.\"\nRelying on these dispositions, the council of the city of Montreal passed, on the 9th of June, 1882, a by-law called u by-law concerning markets\" bearing No. 131, which, among other dispositions, enacts as follows :\u2014\nArticle V. Private Stalls.\nSec. 44. No person shall sell or expose for sale in any private stall or shop in the city, outside of the public meat markets aforesaid, any meat, fish, vegetable, or provisions usually bought and sold on public meat markets, unless he shall have obtained a license from the said council, as hereinafter provided.\nPigeon, the appellant, having been sued before the recorder's court, in Montreal, for having exposed meat for sale in a private stall, without a license, in violation of the dispositions of the aforesaid by-law, took out a writ of prohibition to enjoin the said court from further proceeding in the cause on the ground that the said by-law was null and void and that the court had no jurisdiction. The two courts below unanimously quashed the writ of prohibition, and the appellant now asks the reversal of these judgments. I am of opinion that his appeal should be dismissed. His contentions are altogether unfounded.\nAs to the constitutionality of the sections above referred to in the city of Montreal's charter there is no room for controversy, and the appellant himself, though he had alleged in his declaration that these sections were unconstitutional, very properly, in his factum and at the hearing before us abandoned that ground of his action. He contends now not that the statute is ultra vires of the Quebec legislature, but that the by-law under that statute and upon which he was sued before the recorder's court is ultra vires and not authorized by this statute.\nHe attempts to support that contention on two grounds, in the following words which I take from his factum:\nOur contention is, that the part of the above by-law concerning private stalls is ultra, vires inasmuch as the city charter does not authorise the city of Montreal to impose upon private stalls a tax for revenue purposes, but only gives it the power, as mentioned in sub-sec. 27 of sec. 123, to regulate, licence or restrain the sale of fresh meats, vegetables, fish, or other articles usually sold on markets.\nWe claim that the words \" such sum as may be fixed by such by-law \" in sub-sec. 31, must be understood as giving an authorisation to impose such fee as will cover the necessary expenses for issuing the license : and that it is not such an authorisation as is required to give to a municipal corporation the power of taxing.\nThe last reason which we urged against the by-law and for which we claim it must be declared void, is that it imposes upon a certain class of the community a burden of taxation heavier than that of the other citizens. After having paid seven and a-half per cent. of the value of his premises, Pigeon might have carried on any trade or business corner of St. Denis and St. Catharine streets; but so soon as he wants to keep a butcher stall he has to pay, if the by-law is valid, a further sum of two hundred dollars.\nThe first ground is based upon the fact that the sum fixed by the council for a license to sell in a private stall amounts to $200. The council, argues the appellant, has taken undue advantage of its power to license and regulate, and has illegally, under pretence of licensing and regulating, imposed a tax. But sub-sec. 31 expressly gives to the council unlimited powers as to the amount of the license to sell outside of the public market, \"such sum as may be fixed by such by--law.\" How could we, in face of these words declare the by-law illegal because the sum fixed is too high?\nThe city council, under these sections, has the exclusive power to grant or refuse and fix the amount of these licenses and the exrcise of this power cannot be controlled in any way by course of justice.\nThe second ground of objection taken by the appellant against the validity of this by-law is also untenable. The seven and a-half per cent. of the annual value of his premises he paid as a business tax under another by-law, which is a tax imposed on all business men generally. The $200 for a license for a private stall is the price of a privilege, the privilege of selling meat outside of the public markets.\nHad the appellant succeeded in having this section of the by-law relating to private stalls declared illegal, this would not have given him the right to sell meat in his private stall. The only consequence would be that no one at all could legally get a license in Montreal to sell outside of the public markets under sec. 13 of the by-law which enacts that:\nSec.13. No person shall sell or offer, or expose for sale, in or upon any street, lane, yawl, or in any store, shop, dwelling, or other place in the city than one of the meat markets (public or private) established by this by-law, any kind of butchers' meat, fresh pork, turkeys, geese, ducks, poultry, fish, fruits, grain, produce or effects usually brought to and sold on public markets\nI am of opinion we should dismiss the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The case appears to me to be free from doubt, and the judgment of the court appealed from to be quite correct. Whether there is or is not a double tax levied by the city of Montreal in the present case does not seem to me to be before us although I do not see any objection to the corporation charging a business tax of 7\u00bd per cent on the value of the rental of the premises, where, under a license to sell meat outside of the public market a butcher carries on his trade in addition to the sum paid for the privilege of selling outside of the public market, and for which privilege the statute authorizes the municipality to charge a license fee of any amount they think fit. The appellant in the proceeding in the recorder's court, which is sought to be prohibited, is charged with selling meat outside of the public market of the city of Montreal without having obtained the leave of the corporation to do so; that such an act can be prohibited by by-law under a penalty, in case of breach, and that a suit for the recovery of such penalty is within the jurisdiction of the recorder's court to adjudicate upon, cannot be doubted.\nThe appeal must therefore be dismissed.\nPATTERSON J. concurred with TASCHEREAU J.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Laflamme, Madore & Cross.\nSolicitor for respondents : Rotier Roy.\n[1] 33 L.C.J. 221.\n"

Prescription of six months enacted by c. 109. sec. 27 R.S.C. 2. Besides the general issue a special denial that the fire had been set by their engine and that even if said fire was caused by sparks from the engine the defendants were guilty of no negligence but on the contrary, had used every precaution and diligence possible in the running of said engine.\nFrom the evidence it appeared that the train was composed of fifteen loaded cars and that when the train was passing respondents' buildings, situated within fifty feet from the line of rails there was an unusual quantity of sparks emitted by the engine, because there was too heavy a load for the engine to draw on such an up-grade and that the sparks set fire to respondents' buildings. It also appeared by the evidence that at this particular part of the railroad, the railroad is narrowed in order to save the expense of expropriating and paying for the building, through parts of which the railway boundary line would have passed had it been at its full width.\nBrosseau for appellant and Robinson Q.C., and Geoffrion Q.C. for respondents.\nOn the argument counsel for the appellant did not insist on the plea of prescription, but argued at some length that the appellant company were not liable having used every precaution and diligence possible in the running of the engine.\nSir W. J RITCHIE C.J. The question raised in this case was a pure question of fact and there was, in my opinion, ample evidence to justify the respective courts in coming to the conclusion at which they have arrived. I do not see how they could have come to any other conclusion Therefore I think this appeal should be dismissed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. It is very evident from the evidence that the fire was set by sparks, which were emitted from the appellant company's locomotive, several witnesses who were present saw the sparks and state that the fire broke out immediately. On this question of fact there can be no doubt that the judgments appealed from should be confirmed.\nThere was another question raised by the pleadings, viz. prescription, but on the present appeal the counsel for appellant did not rely upon that. I will only add that I concur fully in the judgment of Mr. Justice Cimon on this point, whose judgment was concurred in by the Court of Queen's Bench.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am also of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by the judges of the Court of Appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In the argument before us this case resolved itself into a mere question of fact, namely, whether certain premises of the plaintiff, at St. Laurent which were burned down on the 24th August 1883 were set fire to by an engine of the defendants, running upon that part of the Canadian Pacific Railway which lies between St. Martin's and Montreal the learned judge who tried the case found the fact in the affirmative in favour of the plaintiff and certainly the evidence was abundantly sufficient to support that judgment. There was a plea of prescription upon the record as to which, although the point raised by it was not pressed before us, it may perhaps be as well to say that, in my opinion, neither sec. 27 of ch. 109 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, nor sec. 287 of 51 Vic. ch. 29, have any reference to an action like the present, which is for damage, not occasioned by reason of the railway, but by reason of sparks being suffered to escape from an engine running upon it, by the default and neglect of the company whose engine causes the damage which, as in the present case, may not be the company owning the railway. The provision in those sections that the defendants charged with having caused damage by reason of the railway may prove that what was done in pursuance of and by the authority of the act, or of the special act, shows that what is meant is damage done by the railway itself and not by reason of the default or neglect of the company owning the railway, or of a company having running powers over it, by reason of insufficiency in the construction of the engines used, or of negligence in the manner of running them upon the railway. This latter damage is no more damage \"sustained by reason of the railway\" than damage to goods being carried upon the railway by reason of negligence in the manner of running a train is. I concur that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The only question argued was one of fact, and it is only on that question that I give any opinion.\nI agree that the appeal must be dismissed. Indeed, I noted my opinion at the argument that it might properly have been dismissed on Mr. Brosseau's statement of the evidence.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Lacoste, Bisaillon, Brosseau & Lajoie.\nSolicitors for respondents : Lunn & Cramp.\n"

C.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench. (Appeal Side) for Lower Canada, affirming a judgment of the Superior Court condemning the appellant to pay the respondent five hundred dollars damages and ordering the demolition of a dam.\nThe plaintiff brought an action against the defendant, in the Superior Court, at Bedford, alleging that by deed of sale dated 30th October 1873 before Lefebvre notary Luke Holland Knowlton sold him a certain piece of land described in the declaration at full length, supposed to contain about 200 acres of land, including such parts as may be covered by the waters of Brome Lake being* lot number 18 in the 7th range of the said township, and the residue of lot number 17 in the eleventh range.\nTint by another deed of the 30th October 1873 passed before Lefebvre, notary, Thomas A. Knowlton sold to the plaintiff a certain piece of land in the said township, parts of lots number 16 and 17 in the eleventh range therein described.\nThat the defendant is and was proprietor of several lots of land described in a deed of sale amongst others lot number 24 in the 10th range of lots in the township of Brome, as having acquired the same on the 27th day of August, 1878, at a sale under the authority of justice at the office of the Registrar of the County of Brome under a writ of execution issued out of the Superior Court, in which The Trust and Loan Company were plaintiffs, and one Charles Gr. Jones defendant. That the only outlet by which the waters of Brome Lake flow passes through said lot number 24 owned by the defendant, bordering upon said lake, through which outlet flows a large stream. That when the flow of the water of the said lake is not obstructed, and the water is allowed to assume its natural level, the same does not rise sufficiently to overflow or to saturate any of plaintiff's property.\nThat during the year 1881 the defendant, under the pretence that he was improving said outlet, and in order* to construct mills built and caused to be built across said outlet, where the same passes through his said lot a dam of such height and strength as to dam UD and stop the flow of the waters of the said outlet and of the said lake, causing the waters to rise above their ordinary and natural level, and to overflow a large tract of land surrounding the said lake. That in consequence of the increased rise of the water caused by the dam so erected by the defendant the water overflows a large quantity to wit ; 40 acres of plaintiffs farm which borders the said lake rendering the same useless and unfit for agriculture and this since the year 1881, causing damages to the amount of $1,200,00, with additional damages to the walks and grounds of the plaintiff to an amount of $200,00, and to the wood lands so overflowed to an amount of $200,00; total amount of damages, $1,600.00. The plaintiff further alleged that defendant has failed to erect any mill or manufacture in connection with said dam the same having been put up for the malicious purpose of impeding the flow of the waters and to damage plaintiffs property.\nPlaintiff fyled with his action a plan showing the extent of the injury caused to this property by such overflow of water. Plaintiff concluded that the defendant be condemned to demolish and lower said dam so as to reduce the level to its natural course and be prohibited in future from impeding the natural plan of the water, and to pay the amount of damages claimed\nThe defendant pleaded to the action, first, by a general denegation; secondly, the defendant specially alleged that the dam referred to in plaintiffs declaration was erected and constructed upon the water-course, running through and across defendants land, and constructed for the purpose of turning the water dower to account for the operation of mills and manufactures, and for working and operating machinery.\nThat a dam was constructed for that purpose to the height and of the dimension of the existing dam more than 50 years ago, and long prior to the acquisition by the said plaintiff of the lands and tenements described in his declaration, and during all that time, to wit, for 40 years' and upwards, the said defendant, both by himself and his auteurs occupied, possessed, and enjoyed openly, peaceably and publicly the right to use and enjoy the said water course as improved by the said dam and the dam which it replaced, whereby he acquired a prescriptive right thereto, which prescription the defendant invokes.\nAfter issue joined, the parties proceeded to their evidence, and the two course below, upon the weight of evidence, found that the appellant's dam caused a considerable rise in the waters of the lake which overflowed a portion of the respondents property, and that the appellant had not put up any mill or machinery to utilize the waters of the lake in connection with the dam he had built and condemned the appellant to pay $500 damages and to remove the dam, if not used within a year.\nLaflamme, Q. C, for appellant, relied on Consolidate Statutes of Lower Canada, Oh. 51, and contended that respondent never had actual possession of the land overflowed except as it then stood covered by water, and that the dam with its appurtenances was the absolute property of the appellant for over thirty years. Art. 2242, C.C.\nGeoffrion, Q.C., and Duffy, for respondent, contended that defendant\u2019s his are restricted to those of an ordinary owner under a sheriff's deed of sale, and that there is no proof of any title as a connecting link between him and his predecessors respecting their alleged rights in plaintiff's land. That as there are no mills, machinery or works to be operated by the clam the servitude has ceased, and the dam cannot be maintained independently. That by Article 501 C.C., plaintiff is entitled to ask the demolition of the dam. That so long as there are no mills, works or machinery operated by this dam it is not within the provisions of Oh. 51 C.S.L.C, and that statute cannot be opposed to the demolition of the dam. Sir W. J RITCHIE O.J.\u2014I can see no reason for interfering with the judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Province of Quebec and am of opinion the same should be confirmed, and the appeal dismissed.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Le 30 octobre 1873 l\u2019intim\u00e9 a ach\u00e9t\u00e9 par acte notari\u00e9, de Luke Holland Knowlton et Thomas .A.

L\u2019intim\u00e9 a examine seize t\u00e9moins pour \u00e9tablir les faits de sa declaration. Il r\u00e9sulte clairement do cette preuve que le barrage en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit vers 1832 pour la creation d'un pouvoir d'eau qui a servi \u00e0 faire mouvoir des moulins de diverses esp\u00e8ces construits par les auteurs de l'appelant. Quelques ann\u00e9es avant 1887, les moulins qui \u00e9taient alors en operation furent d\u00e9truits, et le barrage laiss\u00e9 dans un \u00e9tat de grande d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration exigeant des reparations dispendieuses lorsque I appelant acheta cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la vente faite par le sh\u00e9rif de Bedford. Cette question de fait concernant l'existence du barrage et l'exploitation des moulins pendant un rand nombre d'ann\u00e9es ne souffre aucune difficult\u00e9. Les faits sont trop positivement prouv\u00e9s pour essayer de les contredire. Mais l'appelant se fondant sur son occupation du barrage et du site des moulins pendant au del\u00e0 de 50 ans, pendant lesquels le niveau de l'eau a demeur\u00e9 \u00e0 la m\u00e9me hauteur pr\u00e9tend par cette possession avoir acquis le droit de continuer sa jouissance de ce pouvoir d'eau, \u00e0 l'exclusion des propri\u00e9taires dont les fonds sont converts par l'eau, et avoir \u00e9teint par la prescription leur droit de recouvrer des dommages resultant de l'\u00e9l\u00e9vation du niveau de l'eau; ou, en d'autres mots, apr\u00e9s avoir admis l'\u00e9tat de chose actuel pendant plus de cinquante ans, ne s'\u00eatre jamais servi de leur propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00e9me virtuellement d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9 durant toute cette p\u00e9riode, un acqu\u00e9reur subs\u00e9quent peut-il demander la d\u00e9molition du barrage ou r\u00e9clamer des dommages pour sa reconstruction ?\nIl est vrai que l'\u00e9tat dans lequel se trouvait ces propri\u00e9t\u00e9s a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 le m\u00e9me depuis la construction du premier barrage en 1832, \u00e0 l'exception du fait rapporte par James Davis, un t\u00e9moin de l'intim\u00e9. Il rapporte que Knowlton qui a poss\u00e9d\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9 avant que celui-ci en ait fait l'acquisition, s'\u00e9tant plaint de la hauteur du barrage Jones l'avait r\u00e9duite, et qu'elle n'avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9, depuis, \u00e9lev\u00e9e \u00e0 sa hauteur actuelle.\nCe t\u00e9moin est le seul \u00e0 faire mention de ce fait et se trouve contredit par tousles autres t\u00e9moins appel\u00e9s par l'appelant qui prouve que la hauteur du barrage a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 la m\u00e9me.\nIl est \u00e0 remarquer crue l'appelant n'a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans F. son plaidoyer aucun titre, et qu'il base la prescription qu'il invoque, uniquement sur le fait que lui et ses auteurs ont poss\u00e9d\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du barrage en question pendant plus de trente ans, et que pendant\u2014\u00e0 peu pr\u00e9s\u2014tout ce temps le terrain de l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00baouvert par l'eau comme ii l'est aujourd'hui Lorsqu'il en a fait l'acquisition du sh\u00e9rif en 1873 le terrain est d\u00e9crit dans son titre comme \u00e9tant couvert par l'eau dans une grande partie de sa surface.\nMais sur ce terrain, ainsi couvert d'eau, l'appelant n'a jamais fait aucun acte de possession \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire. Seulement la construction de son barrage faisant \u00e9lever le niveau de l'eau dans le lac la surface s'en trouvait submerg\u00e9e mais ceci n'\u00e9tait que la cons\u00e9quence non d'un acte commis par l'appelant sur le terrain de l'intim\u00e9 mais- de la construction du barrage \u00e9lev\u00e9 sur son propre terrain. Pour avoir droit de maintenir ce barrage il lui faut absolument un titre suivant l'article 549 C.C \"Nulle servitude ne peut s'\u00e9tablir sans titre; la possession m\u00e9me imm\u00e9moriale, ne suffit pas \u00e0 cet effet.\" Cependant l'appelant pretend que le ch. 51 C S. B. C, d\u00e9rogeant au droit commuble, en per-mettant au propri\u00e9taire des terrains que traverse des cours d'eau d'y construire pour l'usage de moulins de manufactures et d'usines, des \u00e9cluses ou barrages ou autres travaux qui font refluer les eaux sur les terrains voisins constitue pour lui un titre suffisant pour lui donner le droit de maintenir son barrage et de faire refluer leseaux du lac sur le terrain de l'intim\u00e9. En effet ce statut a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 par les tribunaux comme ayant \u00e9tabli cette servitude l\u00e9gale en faveur du d\u00e9voloppement de l'industrie manufacturi\u00e9re. Mais d'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 ce statut pourvoit aux moyens d'indemniser les propri\u00e9taires des terrains submerg\u00e9s par les travaux faits en vertu de cette autorisation. Il \u00e9tablit m\u00e9me un mode de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation des dommages caus\u00e9s et oblige, dans le d\u00e9lai de six mois, le propri\u00e9taire des travaux \u00e0 payer les dommages au voisin dont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 souffre par le refoulement des eaux, sous peine d'\u00eatre condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9molir ces travaux. Nul douce que si l'appelant eut allegu\u00e9 et prouv\u00e9 qu'il avait adop\u00e9\u00e9 des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s pour faire fixer l'indemnit\u00e9, il aurait pu invoquer le statut, comme \u00e9tant la base de son droit et comme suffisant pour justifier son plaidoyer de prescription. Mais il ne s'est nullement pr\u00e9valu des dispositions du statut pour faire fixer l'indemnit\u00e9, il ne peut en cousequence en r\u00e9clamer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice \u00e0 moins d'avoir accompli les conditions qui v sont attach\u00e9es. Ii est vrai que les dispositions de ce statut ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme impossible d'ex\u00e9cution, par suite d'une omission dans la loi municipale qui n'a pas pourvu \u00e0 la nomination des experts qui doivent faire l'\u00e9valuation; mais si le mode indiqu\u00e9 ne pouvait \u00eatre employ\u00e9, rien n'empecnait le recours ordinaire aux tribunaux. L'appelant aurait Pu faire des offres de la valeur des dommages et s'adreser aux tribunaux pour les faire declarer suffi. sant\u00e9s. Mais loin de l\u00e0 l'appelant ne semble aucunement s'\u00eatre occup\u00e9 de la question d'indemnit\u00e9; le barrage ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 construit depuis si longtemps, il a cru qu'il en avait acquis le droit par sa longue possession. C'est une erreur; la possession imm\u00e9moriale ne suffisait pas pour cela. Sur ce point la jurisprudence est conforme \u00e0 la loi (1).\nDans son factum en appel, l'appelant, semble avoir abandon\u00e9e le plaidoyer de prescription invoqu\u00e9 pour maintenir son droit de servitude. Il le transforme en plaidoyer de prescription de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du sol de l'intim\u00e9 recouvert par l'eau que son barrage y fait refouler. Ii d\u00e9clare\nIt is not a question of servitude, requiring a title for its maintenance but it is a question of property.\nCe changement de terrain n'am\u00e9liore nullement sa position; ii se met par l\u00e0 dans une position contradictoire. Apres avoir invoqu\u00e9 une servitude sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9, il pr\u00e9tend maintenant qu'il en a acquis la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par prescription. Mais sa pretention d'\u00eatre le propri\u00e9taire du terrain recouvert par l'eau n'est pas mieux \u00e9tablie que son droit de servitude.\nEst-ce en vertu d'un titre qu'il est devenu propri\u00e9taire de ce terrain ? Non, il n'en produit pas. Est-ce par prescription trentenaire ? Avant de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re question, il faut d'abord faire remarquer que la procedure ne lui donne pas le droit de modifier sa position comme il veut le faire; il n'a point plaid\u00e9 qu'il a acquis la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 . du terrain de l'intim\u00e9 par prescription et la loi ne lui permet pas d'en invoquer le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice sans l'avori plaid\u00e9 sp\u00e9cialement. C.C., art. 2188.\nMais en admettant m\u00e9me que son plaidoyer de prescription qu'il a plaid\u00e9 pour soutenir son droit de servitude peut lui servir pour \u00e9tablir une prescription de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9 recouverte par l'eau que son barrage y fait refluer, il lui faut au moins prouver qu'il \u00e9tait dans les conditions n\u00e9cessaires pour acqu\u00e9rir la prescription. Pour cela ii lui aurait fallu prouver conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'art. 2193 qu'il avait eu une possession continue de ce terrain, non interrompue, paisible, publique, non equivoque et \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire. Mais loin del\u00e0, l'appelant ou ses auteurs n'ont jamais en aucune possession quelconque de ce terrain, et l'intim\u00e9 ni ses auteurs n'en ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9s. Cette pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant est absolument sans fondement. Ii n'a pas plus prescrit la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9 qu'il n'a acquis de servitude sur son terrain. Sa d\u00e9fense est tout \u00e0 fait mal fond\u00e9e.\nL'intim\u00e9 a fait la preuve de son dommage que la cour a fix\u00e9 \u00e0 la somme de $500. Cette preuve est suffisante pour justifier le montant qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure dont le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par celui de la Cour du Bane de la Reine. Je suis d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2011I am also of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nAs to the respondent's right of action, I am of opinion that the appellant having no mill or machinery operated by this dam he cannot invoke the provisions of ch. 51 C.S L.C. It must be understood that we express no opinion as to whether, in a proper case, the right of action is taken away or not by that statutory enactment.\nAs to the facts of the case the two courts below having, upon the weight of evidence, found in favour of the respondent we cannot interfere There is nothing in this case to take it out of the well settled rule on such appeals. The facts so found are that the appellant's dam causes a considerable rise in the waters of the lake and thereby the overflow and saturation with moisture of a portion of the respondent's farm. Now, the appellant cannot base his claim to the right of so overflowing the respondent's farm on a right of servitude as he has no title (and he now admits it), but contends that he has the actual right of property in the overflowing of the respondent's farm as incidental to his property of the dam. I fail to see anything in this case to support such a view of the facts and of the law applicable to the facts. The appellant is claiming nothing else than a right of servitude on the respondent's farm. It was nothing else at its origin, and has not been changed into anything else by length of time. The respondent is full owner of his farm, and of every foot of it, and the claim to a right to overflow any part of it is nothing but a claim to a right of servitude. The formal judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench is elaborately drawn, and utterly unassailable.\nGWYNNE and PATTERSON JJ. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Laflamme, Madore & Cross.\nSolicitors for respondent: O' Halloran & Duffy.\n"

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nLessor and lessee\u2014Eviction\u2014Entry by lessor to repair\u2014Intent\u2014Suspension of rent\u2014Construction of lease.\nA lease of business premises provided that the lessor could enter upon the premises for the purpose of making certain repairs and alterations at any time within two months after the beginning of the term, but not after except with the consent of the lessee. An action for rent under the lease was resisted on the ground that the lessor had been in possession of part of the premises after the specified time without the necessary consent whereby the tenant had been deprived of the beneficial use of the property and had been evicted therefrom. On the trial the jury found that no consent had been given by the lessee for such occupation and that the lessee had no beneficial use of the premises while it lasted.\nHeld, per Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ., reversing the judgment of the court below, 1. that the evidence did not justify the finding of no assent; that an express consent was not required, but it could be inferred from the acts and conduct of the lessee.\n2. The two months' limitation in the lease had reference to the entry by the lessor to commence the repairs and not to his subsequent occupation of the premises, and the lessor having entered upon the premises within the prescribed period he had a reasonable time to complete the work and his subsequent occupation was not wrongful.\nPer Taschereau and Gwynne JJ. that assuming assent was necessary the evidence clearly showed that the lessor was on the premises after the 1st of July with the assent of the lessee; he had a right, therefore, to remain until such assent was revoked which was never done.\nPer Patterson J., that interference by a landlord with his tenant's enjoyment of demised premises, even to the extent of depriving the tenant of the use of a portion, does not necessarily work an eviction; a tenant may be deprived of the beneficial occupation of the premises for port of his term, by an act of the landlord, which is wrongful as against him, but unless the act was done with the intention of producing that result it would not work an eviction.\nPer Ritchie C. J. and Strong J., approving the judgment of the court below, that the jury having negatived consent by the lessee, and the evidence showing that the acts of the landlord were of such a grave and permanent character, as to indicate an intention to deprive the tenant of the beneficial enjoyment of a substantial part of the premises, they amounted to an eviction of the tenant which operated as a suspension of the rent.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick refusing to set aside a verdict for the defendant and order a new trial.\nBy an indenture under seal made by and between Robert E. Ferguson and Alfred B. Sheraton, dated the 6th of May, 1882, Ferguson leased to Sheraton certain land in the city of St. John, with all buildings thereon, then occupied by one Warwick and T. and A. Likely, to hold for ten years, commencing on the 1st of May, 1883, that is, at the termination of the leases of said Likely and Warwick, for the sum of $2,800 for each and every year and after the same rate for every part of a year, in four equal quarterly payments in each year, the first payment to be made on the 1st of August, 1883. The material part of this lease, so far as the present enquiry is concerned, is as follows:\n\"It is also hereby mutually agreed upon by and between the parties hereto that the said Robert E. Ferguson and his legal representatives, agents and servants, if he or they should think proper or expedient, may enter upon the said land and premises herein demised for the purpose of repairing, altering or improving the same or any part thereof, at any time either between the date of this indenture and the first day of May, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-three, and for two months thereafter, but not after that time except with the approbation or consent of the said party of the second part or his legal representatives. It is also to be fully and clearly understood by and between the parties hereto that the nature and extent of any repairs, alterations or improvements which the said Robert E. Ferguson or his legal representatives may make upon the said land and premises is to be left and is left entirely and unreservedly to the judgment and decision of the said Robert E. Ferguson and his legal representatives. (But the said Robert E. Ferguson may here state in outline [in parenthesis] what his present intentions are as to said alterations, repairs and improvements, namely, that he intends removing the structures in the rear of the front or main building on the said land and replace the same with a brick structure, with stone foundation, to connect with said main building, and that in the interior, floors may be laid and the walls and ceilings of shop flat, and the two flats over the shops, may be plastered or sheathed with boards in the said addition to the said main building. That stairways may be constructed from one flat to another on all the floors. That an elevator or hoist may be placed on the premises. That drain may be re-cut or new drain made from a point in said proposed addition through the said main building, under the floor of one of the shops in the same, to the front on said street, thence to the sewer leading to the 'main' on said street. And also, that the floor in premises occupied by said Warwick as aforesaid, in the shop part, may be renewed. And also, plumbing may be re-done and gas pipes put in said addition.) It is to be understood also that the said Alfred B. Sheraton and his legal representatives are to make at his and their own expense and risks any and all improvements and repairs which he or they may require during the term of this lease in or upon the said demised premises, over and above what the said Robert E. Ferguson and his legal representatives may make, as above indicated, and to keep the said premises, after such improvements are made, both those of said Robert E. Ferguson and his representatives, and Alfred B. Sheraton and his representatives, in good and sufficient repairs and condition during the term of this lease.\"\nThe defendant Troop and one H. C. Lawton, by an instrument under their respective hands and seals on and annexed to said lease, agreed with plaintiff as follows:\u2014\n\"In consideration of the letting of the premises above described and of the sum of one dollar, to me in hand paid, the receipt whereof I. H. D. Troop, and I. H. C. Lawton, hereby acknowledge, I do hereby become surety for the punctual payment of the rent and performance of the covenants in the above written agreement mentioned to be paid and performed by the said Alfred B. Sheraton for himself, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, in the manner of above agreement, and if any default shall be made therein, I do hereby promise and agree to pay unto the said Robert E. Ferguson, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, such sum or sums of money as will be sufficient to make up such deficiency and fully satisfy the conditions of the said agreement, without requiring any notice of non-payment or proof of demand being made. Given under my hand and seal this sixth day of May, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two.\"\nOn this last instrument the present action is brought against the defendant Troop, the plaintiff alleging that Sheraton entered into and occupied the premises under the lease and became tenant of the plaintiff under the terms of the said lease, and then avers default in payment of rent, and that at the commencement of the suit there was due to the plaintiff $1,400 for two quarters rent. To recover this amount the action was brought.\nTo this defendant pleaded a number of pleas substantially that the tenant was evicted by the landlord from a portion of the demised premises, and the case turns upon whether or not there was an eviction.\nThe repairs were not completed by the first of July and the plaintiff claimed that the delay was caused by the tenant asking for additional improvements. The tenant, in giving evidence at the trial, denied that he ever verbally consented to plaintiff remaining after the 1st of July, but it was sworn that he had insisted upon everything being finished by October, in time for an exhibition which was to be held then.\nThe jury found that the property was not fit to be occupied up to the first of November and that no consent was given by the tenant or his surety for the plaintiff remaining in possession after the time stipulated. The tenant left the premises in September. On these findings of the jury a verdict was entered for the defendant and affirmed by the full court of New Brunswick.\nThere was a former trial of this case, the verdict in which was set aside and a new trial ordered[1].\nGilbert Q.C. for the appellant. There can be no eviction of a tenant unless it appears that the landlord had an intention to evict. Upton v. Townend[2]; Saner v. Bilton[3].\nWeldon Q.C. and Barker Q.C. for the respondent referred to the report of the case in the court below (1) and to the following cases. Upton v. Townend (2); Smith v. Raleigh[4]; Reeve v. Bird[5]; Morrison v. Chadwick[6]; Neale v. McKenzie[7]; Egerton v. Page[8]; Sherman v. Williams[9].\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014It is clear beyond all doubt that by the acts of the landlord the tenant was deprived of the enjoyment of a considerable portion of the premises demised to him, and that in consequence thereof the lessee, after notice that he considered himself evicted, abandoned the premises. The question then is: Did the acts amount to an eviction of this part of the demised premises so as to operate as a suspension of the rent?\nWilliams J. in Upton v. Townend[10] says:\u2014\nConsidering how frequently transactions of this sort are taking place it is somewhat remarkable that so little is to be found in the books upon the subject of eviction. There clearly are some acts of interference by the landlord with the tenant's enjoyment of the premises which do not amount to an eviction, but which may be either mere acts of trespass or eviction according to the intention with which they are done. If those acts amount to a clear indication of intention on the landlord's part that the tenant shall no longer continue to hold the premises they would constitute an eviction.\nChancellor Kent, in a note to the 3rd vol. of the Commentaries[11] says:\u2014\nAny act of a grave and permanent nature done by the landlord with the intention and effect of depriving the tenant of the enjoyment of any portion of the demised premises is an eviction in the modern sense which suspends the entire rent while it lasts, and there cannot be a doubt that the question whether the act is of that character and done with that intent is for the jury.\nCiting Upton v. Townend & Greenlees[12]; Royce v. Guggenheim[13]; Skally v. Shute[14]. And he goes on to say, there can be no doubt that the eviction by the landlord of his tenant from a part of the premises creates a suspension of the entire rent[15].\nIt is clear that the entry by the landlord up to the 1st of July was not with any such intention because it was under the express terms of the lease, so that we have to ascertain whether the acts subsequent to the 1st of July by the landlord were not of such a grave and permanent nature as to amount to an eviction.\nIf the subsequent acts of interference with the tenant's rights rendered it incompatible for him to hold according to the terms of his demise, and those acts were done with the intention of not permitting the tenant to enjoy for the time being the premises as he was entitled to enjoy them, and they were of a serious and continuous character, or as Chancellor Kent expresses it of a grave and permanent nature, then they would, in my opinion, amount to an eviction because the tenant would be thereby deprived of the occupation of the thing demised, and there would be a substantial interference in the enjoyment of the premises by the tenant whereby he would be deprived of the perfect and convenient use of the subject matter of the demise so as to entitle him to say he had not had the enjoyment of that to which he was entitled.\nThe plaintiff claims the right to continue in possession after the first of July by and with the consent of Sheraton and contended that he was to have four months from the first of May to make and complete his improvements; in fact he says that October was fixed upon though he was not to be bound at all as to time. This was unequivocally denied by the tenant and, as the learned Chief Justice in his charge says, the important question the jury had to decide was whether or not Sheraton gave permission to continue the work after the first of July 1883. So the great and material question was whether or not after the first of July 1883 Ferguson had the right to continue and make the improvements on the property. On this point the learned Chief Justice says: \u2014\nThe parties are as far apart as can well be. Sheraton tells you that he gave no consent of that kind whatever; that during the period when Ferguson had a perfect right to be there\u2014that is before the first of July\u2014he remonstrated with him on the slow way in which he was carrying on the work, that he had not sufficient men employed to do the work within the time, and could not do it within the time, but Ferguson always said there was plenty of time and that he would have it done in time.\nThe learned Chief Justice goes on to say:\u2014\nThat is the contention on the part of Sheraton. If there is any part of the evidence you desire read to you I will read it or cause it to be read for you. On the other hand Ferguson says that on or about the first of May, when Sheraton's term commenced, and when he had the right to go in as tenant, they had a conversation, that it was then spoken of that it would require at least four months to do the work instead of two\u2014that is the work Ferguson desired to do there\u2014and the first of October was spoken of, and Sheraton said he would like it done because the Exhibition would take place shortly after that time, and he says more, he says that he told him he could take his own time and did not confine him down to the first of October, and that it might require longer, and that he could take what time he liked. (Reads evidence of Sheraton from record.) (The stenographer reads direct examination of Ferguson from record and part of cross-examination from short-hand notes).\nThis question was left distinctly to the jury and the conclusion to be arrived at depended solely on whether the jury believed the plaintiff or the tenant, and the learned Chief Justice then goes on to say:\u2014\n3. Did the plaintiff continue his work on the property after the 1st July with the consent of Sheraton?\nThis is the important question; they are directly opposed in their testimony to each other, and you must judge between them which is the most likely to be correct. By the terms of the lease I think the fair inference is that two months were supposed to be long enough to make these intended improvements, and he gave himself that power, but then he reserved another right conditionally, if Sheraton would give him permission to continue afterwards, after the 1st of July. It appears to me that putting that term there indicated that he rather thought he would get through his work during that time. They are directly opposed to each other on that, and you must consider which has given the most reasonable kind of evidence. It is always a hard matter to do, but you must find against one party or the other\u2014see which is the most probable. It would seem to be a wild agreement for Sheraton to make, that he would allow the property to be occupied by his landlord for the period of five months to make these improvements, he having no beneficial use of the property at that time, and pay $700 a quarter; and then on the other hand there was one expression of Sheraton's which did strike me as being a little singular, and which seemed to bear out Ferguson, that is about having it in time for the exhibition, and he stated that he was anxious to have it ready for October for the exhibition; you must weigh all these things. Then as to anything said by Sheraton after the 14th of August, you will bear in mind that after that notice he was acting under advice of counsel; he had consulted Dr. Barker, or at all events he was advised as to what his rights were, and it would be very singular that being in that position and coming fresh from Dr. Barker's with that notice in his hand, that he would make any admissions to cut down his rights in the matter; it is, however, for you to decide between these parties.\nTo this question, No 3 the jury say he did not. Then the question is put: 4. Did Sheraton agree that plaintiff might have until the 1st of October to complete his work? To which the jury replied: he did not.\nNo. 6. Did Sheraton consent after giving notice of the 14th of August that the plaintiff should continue on and do the work? To which the jury replied, no.\nThe jury were also asked to find:\u2014\n1. Was the property fit to be occupied for the purpose for which Sheraton leased it between the 1st August and the 1st November, 1883? It was not.\n2. Was the property fit to be so occupied between the 1st November 1883, and 1st February, 1884? It was not.\n5. Did the defendant (Troop) in August, 1883, assent to, or request the plaintiff to remain and finish the work? No.\nThis question was left to the jury at the request of plaintiff's counsel and the plaintiff was expressly contradicted by Troop. This, perhaps, is more important in reference to the credit to be given to the plaintiff's evidence than as bearing on the case directly.\nThe Chief Justice says:\u2014\nYou will bear in mind that there is no contradiction to the fact that he did remain after the 15th September, but there is evidence that although he did go out\u2014it is contended on the part of Sheraton that even down so late as the former trial it was almost in the same condition as when Sheraton left on the 29th of October, and that it was not in a position for beneficial occupation\u2014that is the front shop; that is one of the claims set up.\nUpon these findings the Chief Justice ordered judgment to be entered for the defendant.\nUnder the lease it is my opinion that the landlord was bound to enter and finish the improvements before the first of July unless he could show a clear and express consent of the tenant that he should longer occupy; I think it would be quite unsafe and improper to allow the express terms of the lease, a sealed instrument, to be altered by any such loose conversations as plaintiff relies on; but when the jury have found in direct opposition to his testimony, and had the witnesses before them, and were, no doubt, well acquainted with both parties and chose to believe the tenant in preference to the landlord, it would be against all precedent to disturb their finding. The landlord relying on his claim of right to continue in possession until October, after the letter of the 14th of August, and doing so, and thus keeping the tenant intentionally out of possession from the 1st of July, or certainly from the 14th of August, until October, was in my opinion more than a mere trespasser and his acts were of such a permanent and continuous character as to show an intention of depriving the tenant of the beneficial and perfect enjoyment of a substantial part of the premises, at least for a time, and this was such a wrongful dealing with the property that it could not be beneficially occupied by the tenant, and doing this under a claim of right, what intention could he have had but to deprive the tenant of the beneficial use, enjoyment and occupation of the property from the 1st of July to October as he claims he had a right to do? Sheraton might have chosen to rest on his rights but it certainly cannot be said that he did so after the letter of the 14th of August when he was acting under legal advice. If Sheraton had the right to leave the premises when he did we have no right to speculate on the motives which may have prompted him to remain quiescent until the 14th of August. The jury disbelieved the evidence of the plaintiff and believed the evidence of the tenant, and that evidence very clearly shows that Sheraton was deprived by the wrongful acts of the landlord of the beneficial occupation of a portion of the premises, and as the landlord had no right to occupy or continue to occupy after the first of July for the purpose of repairs, his acts amounted to an exclusion of Sheraton from the possession of the premises under a claim of right; such acts being of a grave and permanent nature can it be said that they do not clearly indicate an intention that the tenant should no longer continue to hold those portions of the premises of which the landlord was in possession because the tenant could have no beneficial enjoyment of them during the time he was occupying, as the jury found, wrongfully?\nI think, therefore, the tenant having been intentionally deprived of the possession of a part of the premises by the landlord the rent was suspended and the obligation to pay the rent ceased until the tenancy was restored.\nThe case was before the court on demurrer, has been twice tried and I should not be willing to send it to another trial unless I was satisfied there had been clear misdirection, or that there was no evidence to justify the verdict of the jury, of which, accepting the evidence of the tenant, there was ample. In my opinion there was been litigation enough. The charge of the learned Chief Justice on the second trial was entirely satisfactory.\nSTRONG J.\u2014Concurred in the judgment of the court below.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014For the reasons given by my brother Gwynne I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The issues were brought down for trial at the circuit court for the city of St. John, in January, 1885, before Mr. Justice Fraser, who charged the jury that under the terms of the lease the plaintiff had a right to enter upon the demised premises to make repairs and alterations, and that it was not material whether the work took two months or four months, as with Sheraton's consent the plaintiff could remain after the 1st of July, and that it was for them to say whether down to the 14th of August he had this consent. He directed them that if the plaintiff began to make improvements he must continue to complete them, and he said that what the defendant claimed was that there had been an eviction of Sheraton, and he left it to the jury to say whether the plaintiff remained on the premises after the 1st day of July for the temporary purpose of making repairs or with the intention of permanently depriving Sheraton of the enjoyment of the whole or any part of the leased premises; and he directed them that in the latter case there had been an eviction but otherwise that it was only a trespass. The jury upon this charge rendered a verdict for the plaintiff. Upon a motion to set aside this verdict and for a new trial the Supreme Court of New Brunswick set aside the verdict and granted the new trial upon the ground of misdirection in the above charge and held that, under the terms of the lease, the plaintiff had no right after the 1st of July, 1883, to enter at all upon the demised premises or to make any repairs thereon, and that if he did so, and in doing so excluded Sheraton from the beneficial occupation of any part of the premises, it would be an eviction to that extent\u2014and that, in fact he had no right to undertake the making of any repairs unless he should finish them by the 1st of July\u2014that this agreement in the lease might be altered as between Sheraton and the plaintiff so as to release the plaintiff from its terms, but that if this was done without the defendant's consent he would be discharged, and that, as to the defendant, the court was obliged to act solely on the written agreement (in the lease) as the defendant never consented to any alteration of it. The case accordingly came down again for trial at the St. John March Circuit of 1888, when the defendant claimed the right and was permitted to begin, which he did, by calling the tenant, Sheraton, as a witness on his behalf, for the purpose of establishing by him that he was evicted from a part of the premises by the plaintiff, whereby the rent reserved as issuing out of the whole of the demised premises became suspended. Upon this allegation of eviction the defence was wholly rested.\nSheraton testified that upon the 1st and 2nd of May, 1883, he entered into possession of the demised premises, and that their condition at that time was very bad. It will be convenient now, bearing in mind this statement, before proceeding further with his evidence, to draw attention to the terms of the lease under which he entered upon possession of the premises which, at the time of his entry, he admits to have been in a very bad condition. He was informed by the lease that one Likely was tenant of one part, and one Warwick was tenant of another part, of the premises until the 1st of May, 1883, when Sheraton's term was to commence, and it appears by Sheraton's lease that the leases, under which Likely and Warwick respectively held possession, were placed in Sheraton's hands for his perusal before he executed and accepted the lease to himself, and that he was informed that Warwick was the owner of all the shelving in the shop leased to and occupied by him, and of part of that which was in the rooms on the floors above that shop; and that he, as such owner, had a right to remove and take away that shelving. The demising clause in the lease to Sheraton witnesseth:\u2014\nThat the said Robert E. Ferguson, for the consideration hereinafter mentioned, does hereby lease, demise, and let unto the said Alfred B. Sheraton, a certain parcel of land, situate on King street in the said city, known and distinguished on the map or plan of the city as lot No. 389, with all the buildings thereon standing, excepting as hereinafter specified, in regard to propositions for improvements, and a clause in the lease of one Warwick, now in possession of part of said demised premises, namely, that he is owner of all the shelving in the shop, and part of same in floors above said shop, (the fixtures belonging to and now found in that part of said demised premises, occupied at present by T. & H. Likely, belong to the said Robert E. Ferguson) to hold for the term of ten years, commencing the 1st day of May, 1883, (that is at the termination of the lease of the said Likely and Warwick) the said Alfred B. Sheraton agreeing to the terms and conditions of this the within lease, subject to the said existing leases and tenancies, (the said Warwick's and Likely's leases having been handed to the said Alfred B. Sheraton by the said Robert E. Ferguson to read and if he should think proper to copy the same previous to the execution and delivery of this indenture).\nNow, with respect to the above words, \"with all buildings thereon standing, excepting as hereinafter specified, in regard to propositions for improvements,\" it is to be observed that subsequent provisions in the lease leave it quite optional with the plaintiff, whether he should or not make any of the improvements which are outlined, as the expression is, in the lease. Sheraton enters into a covenant that he will at the expiration of the lease peaceably yield up to the plaintiff\nall and singular the premises, and all future erections, additions and improvements that may be made to and upon the same during the term of this agreement in as good order and condition, in all respects, (damage by fire and other unavoidable casualties alone excepted) as the same now are, or may be put into by the said Robert E. Ferguson or his legal representatives provided the said Robert E. Ferguson or his legal representatives do actually make the improvements hereinafter outlined.\nThen the clause in which they are outlined is as follows[16]:\nThis clause in the lease seems in very plain language to have left it entirely and unreservedly to the judgment and decision of the plaintiff, whether he should or should not make all or any of the suggested alterations and improvements thus outlined, and in case the plaintiff should eventually resolve not to make some or any of them there is no provision in the lease for any reduction in the rent, so that if the plaintiff should conclude not to make any of them, or some of them, the lessee would still be liable for the whole rent, and, in addition to furnishing the premises which had been occupied by Warwick with fixtures in lieu of those which he should remove under the clause in his lease in that behalf, would be obliged to make at his own expense such of the outlined alterations and improvements as the plaintiff should conclude not to make, and as should be necessary for the complete beneficial enjoyment of the demised premises by the lessee. Bearing in mind then, the statement of Sheraton, that at the time of his entering into possession of the demised premises, on the 1st or 2nd May, 1883, they were in a very bad state of repair, and in view of the nature of the proposed alterations as outlined in the lease, we may safely conclude that such alterations, or some of them, were actually necessary, and that it was manifestly of the utmost importance to the lessee, and wholly in his interest, that the plaintiff should make the outlined alterations, and that to induce him to do so, and to enable him to complete them, the utmost facilities should be given to him by Sheraton, whatever length of time might reasonably be necessary for that purpose. These considerations afford, I think, some assistance in enabling us to construe the clause in the lease giving to the plaintiff license of entry upon the demised premises for the purpose of making the suggested alterations and improvements. That clause is as follows:\nIt is also hereby mutually agreed upon by and between the parties hereto, that the said Robert E. Ferguson and his legal representatives, agents and servants, if he or they should think proper or expedient, may enter upon the land and premises herein demised for the purpose of repairing, altering or improving the same, or any part thereof, at any time, either between the date of this indenture and the first day of May, 1883, or for two months thereafter, but not after that time except with the approbation or consent of the said party of the second part, or his legal representatives.\nNow, the words in this clause,\nat any time between the date of this indenture and the first day of May, 1883,\nare wholly irrelevant and insensible, because during all that time the premises were under lease to Likely and Warwick, so that Sheraton could not, during that period, grant any license to the plaintiff to enter upon the premises for any purpose. We must, therefore, in order to construe the clause, leave out of it this period and these words; and as the license purported to be granted by Sheraton could only operate from and after the first day of May, 1883, we must read the clause as providing only from that day, and by a slight transposition and appropriate collocation of its members it will read thus:\nIt is also hereby mutually agreed upon by and between the parties hereto, that the said Robert E. Ferguson and his legal representatives, servants and agents, if he or they should think proper or expedient, may, at any time within two months after the first day of May, 1883, but not after that time except with the approbation or consent of the said party of the second part or his legal representatives, enter upon the said land and premises herein demised, for the purpose of repairing, altering or improving the same or any part thereof.\nNow, there is not a word in the clause prescribing any time within which the repairs, alterations or improvements which should be commenced should be completed. The clause does not say that the plaintiff may, within two months after the 1st May, 1883, enter and complete such repairs, alterations or improvements as he may make on the demised premises, but that within the period named he may enter upon the demised premises; for what purpose? solely for the purpose of repairing, altering and improving the premises. The license does not authorize an entry for any other purpose; but whether the repairs, alterations or improvements to be undertaken consequential upon such entry would require six months or any lesser period for their completion, the lease does not profess to prescribe. The period within which the license to enter should operate (unless supplemented by further approbation or consent of the lessee) is limited, and the sole purpose for which such entry is permitted is defined, namely, for the purpose of repairing, altering or improving the demised premises; but what these repairs, alterations or improvements should be is undefined, and necessarily so, for they are left to the sole judgment and will of the plaintiff; and these being undefined and left to the judgment and will of the plaintiff, the time within which such as the plaintiff might resolve to undertake should be completed, must necessarily be undefined also; and must, therefore, extend to such time as might be reasonably necessary for the completion of such repairs, alterations and improvements as should be undertaken. And this appears to me to be the true construction of the lease\u2014namely, that the plaintiff could, after the 1st day of July, 1883, continue to enter upon the demised premises for the completion of repairs, alterations and improvements commenced within two months after the 1st day of May, 1883, and for such length of time as might be reasonably necessary for such completion without any further \"approbation or consent\" of the lessee beyond what was implied in the license granted by the lease.\nNow Sheraton's evidence was adduced by the defendant for the purpose of establishing the eviction which the defendant had pleaded, and his examination-in-chief proceeded wholly upon the assumption that the plaintiff had no right whatever to enter upon the demised premises after the 1st July, 1883, or to make any repairs or improvements whatever thereon after that day, although for the purpose of completing work begun before the 1st day July, unless he should obtain the consent of Sheraton expressly given for that purpose and Sheraton swore that he never did give such consent. It may be said that every day that the plaintiff was occupied in executing repairs and improvements commenced by him he necessarily made a distinct entry upon the demised premises, but, as I have already said, the true construction of the lease appears to me to be that there was an implied license already granted by the lease without any further approbation or consent of the lessee to enter from day to day so long as was reasonably necessary for the completion of repairs and improvements commenced within two months after the 1st of May, 1883; however, whatever may be the true construction of the lease in this respect, the words of the lease are\nBut not after that time except with the approbation or consent of the said party of the second part (the lessee).\nNow, such approbation or consent may be implied as well as expressed, and it may be implied from divers circumstances without a word being said for the purpose of conveying in express terms such approbation or consent, as for example, if during the progress of the work by the plaintiff, after the first of July, the lessee should make suggestions as to the mode in which he would like certain of the repairs and improvements (in progress of being made by the plaintiff) executed; or if he should, while repairs contemplated by the plaintiff were in progress of execution, request the plaintiff to undertake for the benefit of the lessee an improvement which the plaintiff had not contemplated, and which the plaintiff, upon such request of the lessee, should undertake to do, the completion of which would delay for an undefined period the completion of the works which the plaintiff had in progress of execution; or if, during the progress of the repairs and improvements by the plaintiff, the lessee should be urging him to expedite his work in order that the lessee might have the full enjoyment of the demised premises with the repairs and improvements completed by a distant specified day; or if the lessee was himself continuing to make repairs and improvements not within the improvements contemplated by the plaintiff during the same time, and after the 1st of July, as the plaintiff was proceeding with the repairs and improvements he was making; from all these and the like circumstances a jury might well imply that the plaintiff had the approbation of the lessee to continue with his work to completion after the first day of July, equally as if he had the lessee's express consent to that effect given verbally or in writing.\nNow, Sheraton in his examination in chief says that the plaintiff continued working on the premises until the middle of August, when he applied for the rent due the 1st August, and that he, Sheraton, sent the rent and a letter dated the 14th August, which had been framed for him by counsel, and to which I shall have occasion to refer by and bye; he also said that he told the plaintiff several times after the first day of July that it would be worth a great deal to him, Sheraton, to have the place completed at the time of the exhibition in October, and that he impressed this upon the plaintiff, and that it would not be done at the rate the plaintiff was going on.\nBeing then asked if he ever assented to the plaintiff remaining in or on the premises for the purpose of making the repairs beyond the 1st of July, he answered \"I do not know what you mean by assent; do you mean a verbal assent?\" to which the counsel for the defendant, who was examining him, saying \"yes\" he answered \"then I never did.\" Being then asked, \"did he consent to it in any other way? he answered, \"the only way is that I did work myself after the 1st July, and I don't know how you would construe that.\"\nUpon cross-examination he repeated that he was anxious to have all the work done in time for the exhibition in October and that he urged the plaintiff to get it done by that time\u2014that he did so several times, and that the plaintiff repeatedly told him he would have the work done in time. He said further that it was in the month of July that he urged the plaintiff about getting the work done and that he was not prepared to say that he did not do so, also, in August. Being then asked again if he did not in any way assent to the plaintiff staying on the premises after the 1st day of July he answered\u2014\"I explained that before; I distinctly deny ever giving him a verbal consent.\" Being then asked \"if that is true what is the sense or meaning of wanting him to have the work done before the exhibition in October\" he answered \"You will have to draw your own inference from that, I cannot say and being asked, whether it was not in the month of August when a Mr. John Ferguson was working on the Likely building for Sheraton that he spoke to the plaintiff about getting done by exhibition time he answered:\nI cannot say, I do not know that I went to work in August, with the view of getting it done by that time but with the view of getting my work done; up to that time I had no idea of quitting the premises.\nSheraton also said that immediately after he had entered into possession under the lease the plaintiff began to make the repairs and improvements indicated in the lease, and that he commenced by taking down the wooden building in the rear, fronting on Market Street, that he took out the windows on the King Street front of the \"Likely\" building and cut down the work underneath the window so as to make an opening down to the level of the street, to enable cars to go in and out, which did go in and out, carting out the materials from the excavation under the new building to be erected in lieu of the wooden one taken down.\nThis work was done in order to make the excavation under the new building, which eventually, was excavated to the depth of 14 or 15 feet below the level of Market Street, upon which the new building fronted; in doing this work the fixtures in the \"Likely\" shop were taken down. These fixtures, including shelves, counters and certain show windows taken out of the Likely building to let the carts get through to the rear, Sheraton asked for and received the plaintiff's permission to take away to the Warwick shop, and to use them for the purpose of fitting up that shop which Sheraton was fitting up himself. With the fitting up of that shop the plaintiff had nothing to do, and, consequently, Sheraton would have to supply for fitting up the Likely shop, when it should be in a condition to be fitted up, such articles as he had been thus permitted to remove to the Warwick shop.\nAs to the upper window taken out of the front of the Likely shop by the plaintiff Sheraton contemplated having it put in differently from what it had been; his proposed alteration in that window required a difference in the glass.\nSheraton says that he asked the plaintiff if he should make the alteration whether the order could be included in an order of the plaintiff's, and he said he did not go down to one Thorne and cancel the plaintiff's order for glass, but he admitted that he did go to Thorne about the glass he intended to put in himself, but that he found his estimate too high and could not do it; he said, further, that he did not think he spoke to the plaintiff about altering that glass until after the first of July. Being asked if he did not offer to pay the plaintiff ten per cent. on the cost of the glass if the plaintiff should get it he answered, \"I said if he spent $1,000 on such improvements as I would indicate I would pay ten per cent., and that glass was part of it. I forget what else there was, but there was something about shelving, about the vault there was a separate understanding.\" It thus appears that Sheraton in the month of July contemplated, as necessary to the complete enjoyment of the demised premises for his purposes, certain improvements in addition to those then in progress of being made by the plaintiff requiring an outlay of about $ 1,000, upon which he expressed himself to be willing to pay 10 per cent. in addition to the rent, but he said that he and the plaintiff came to no conclusion about the $1,000, as the plaintiff refused to do it. He admits that there was a separate understanding about a vault, what it was he did not state. He admitted also that at his request the plaintiff agreed to put in water closets, and that he thinks there was an agreement as to the cellar, but what it was either he does not state; neither vault, water closets or cellar are indicated in the lease. He also said that he was not prepared to swear that it was not at his request that the back wall of the front building was pulled down, but that he did not think it was.\nIt appeared that the excavation to put in the water closets was in rock which had to be blasted, and he admitted that no one could deny that it would take more time and more expense to excavate the cellar and put in the water closets than if the foundation of the new building had been put on the rock. It is to be observed that to have placed the foundation on the rock would have been a compliance with the improvements as indicated in the lease, while the building of the water closets necessitated a deep drain from them.\nSheraton also said that both he himself and the plaintiff went on working until August; that about the 14th August, the date of the letter he sent to the plaintiff, he Sheraton, was working at the Likely buildings, fixing the ceiling\u2014putting in joists\u2014and that up to that time he did not know that he made any objection to the plaintiff remaining carrying on the works he was executing, beyond remonstrating about the time he was taking\u2014that up to that time he had no idea of quitting the premises. He had already said, as we have seen, that during the month of July he was repeatedly urging the plaintiff to expedite his work, so that the alterations and improvements in progress of being made might be completed by the time of the exhibition in October. Now the suggestion of the plaintiff is, that in truth it was not any delay on the part of the plaintiff in proceeding with the repairs and improvements be was making that was the cause of Sheraton's sudden change of mind and conduct and of the letter of the 14th of August, but that Sheraton's failure in his business, by reason of his having been unable to negotiate an arrangement with his English creditors, was the sole cause of the letter of the 14th of August and of Sheraton from that date ceasing to execute the work which he himself had to execute and, until then, was executing, and of his finally, two days before the next quarter's rent becoming due, abandoning the demised premises as no longer of any use to him by reason of his failure in his business.\nUp to that time he had no idea, as he himself admitted, of quitting the premises; and he said that he would not swear whether or not it had ever occurred to him that he was not going to stay on the demised premises until he found that his negotiations in England had failed. Being asked whether the whole cause of the difficulty with the plaintiff was not that if he could have gone on straight with his business there would have been no difficulty and that he would not have left his answer was \"I would have sued him for damages.\" Being then asked what remained to be done on the 14th of August, that is which the plaintiff had to do except the furnishing of the stairways his answer was \"all the stairs had to be built,\" but whether the stairs in the lower store were or were not almost finished on the 14th of August he could not remember.\nNow, from the above, it may reasonably be inferred that Sheraton's failure to come to an arrangement with his creditors, and the writing of the letter of the 14th of August, which was framed by counsel for Sheraton, were contemporaneous occurrences.\nBeing then asked whether, after the letter of the 14th August, he did not on that day or the day after meet the plaintiff and have a conversation with him in relation to its contents he answered, \"I do not remember.\" Being pressed with a repetition of the question whether he did not meet the plaintiff on King street and speak about the letter he answered still, \"I do not remember.\" Being still pressed whether the plaintiff did not then ask him if he wanted him to quit work, he answered that he did not think he replied anything to him, as he was then acting under the advise of his counsel and held his tongue.\nIn this answer there is something which certainly seems to give great weight to the suggestion of the plaintiff as to the real cause of the difficulty being the fact of Sheraton's failure to arrange with his creditors, and his consequent determination as an unavoidable necessity that he should leave the premises, in which but for that failure he would have carried on his business, and not any wrong committed by the plaintiff, whether of the nature of eviction or of any other nature. We find Sheraton and the plaintiff working upon the premises during the whole of the month of July, Sheraton, as he himself says, repeatedly, during that period, urging the plaintiff to expedite his work so that the premises might be completed by the time of the exhibition in October. We find the plaintiff during this month executing at Sheraton's request or suggestion some work which the plaintiff had not undertaken to execute or contemplated executing himself, and which necessarily delayed the completion of the work he had contemplated executing, and was in progress for a period of time not specified. In the month of August they continue working, each at his own part of the work, which was in progress, and all that passes between Sheraton and the plaintiff was this urgency on the part of the former upon the latter to expedite his work when suddenly, and contemporaneously with Sheraton finding that he can make no arrangement with his English creditors, and that his failure in his business is inevitable, he consults counsel who drafts for him this letter of the 14th of August, and gives him advice as to his future conduct towards the plaintiff, which would seem to have been to the effect that he should be guarded as to having any conversation with the plaintiff upon the subject of the letter, for this, I think, is the fair inference to be drawn from Sheraton's last answer above stated.\nThe letter, which was written by Sheraton's counsel for his signature and signed by him, was in the shape of a notice addressed to the plaintiff in the terms following\u2014and this is the first time that any idea of anything in the nature of an eviction had taken place appears to have occurred to Sheraton.\nI hereby notify you that as you have not finished the improvements to the premises as you were to do, and thus kept me out of the possession of the premises, and evicted me from them, I pay the quarter's rent due the first August instant under protest, not waiving my rights, to avoid distress. I give you notice that I now claim your conduct amounts to an eviction, and that the rent is suspended and that I shall hold you liable for all damage which I have sustained or may by reason of my not being permitted to occupy the premises. I wish to inform you that the damage is serious and that you will be held responsible.\nThe first sentence in this letter would have been disingenuous in the extreme, it would have been unfounded in point of fact, if the language had proceeded from Sheraton himself, who had knowledge of the fact that all that had passed between himself and the plaintiff up to the day upon which the notice was written was that Sheraton was repeatedly urging the plaintiff to expedite his work so that all that had to be done might be completed by the time of the exhibition in October, for that he was most anxious to have it all done in time for that exhibition, as he himself has sworn in his evidence, but it appears that the language was merely that of counsel putting a legal construction upon the terms of the lease apart from anything which had taken place between Sheraton and the plaintiff; while the notice insists that Sheraton had already been evicted, whereby the rent became suspended, it proceeds to say that he, nevertheless, pays the quarter's rent which fell due on the 1st of Angust although, by the eviction, if any such had taken place, the rent having thereby become suspended none was due or payable. Whether there had been an eviction, as insisted upon in that notice, is still the question in this action; for the determination of that question, we have, however, the light which has since been thrown upon the case by the evidence given by Sheraton himself in this action, from which the above passages have been extracted.\nNow the plaintiff in most express terms contradicted the evidence of Sheraton as to there having been no express agreement between them as to the time the plaintiff should have for completion of his work. He said that prior to the month of May it was talked of between them that it would take four months to complete the contemplated work, and that in the month of May, when the work was first begun, they had another conversation upon the subject, which resulted in an agreement, that in consideration that Sheraton intended occupying the upper shop, as his doing so would make a longer time necessary, the plaintiff should have an additional month, namely, to the 1st of October. This, he said, came about in this way: in conversation Sheraton said that plaintiff would have plenty of time to do the work as he, Sheraton, had taken the Foster store for another year. He said that it would be better and easier to do the work in the summer, that this would go to the 1st of September; then he spoke about occupying the upper store for gents' furnishing goods which he said were on the way. Plaintiff thereupon said that would naturally retard the work, which could not be carried on so well if Sheraton should occupy the upper store. They then named another month, namely, until the 1st October, and thereupon plaintiff said that he would try to get done by the 1st. of October, but that he did not like to be bound down to anytime as something might occur to prevent him, and that he then asked Sheraton if he was satisfied to that, and that he replied yes, he was satisfied. He said that this was their arrangement as to time, and that there was no other in reference to time except about the exhibition which he said came up.\nThis is the substance of so much of the plaintiff's evidence as was in direct contradiction to that of Sheraton. His original intention, he said, as to the rear building, was to lay its foundation on the rock, that is about eight feet below the level of Market street, and he proceeded to do so, but while he was excavating a trench for this purpose Sheraton requested him to excavate a cellar and to put in water closets, which he did; this necessitated an excavation under the building of a further depth of seven feet, and a deepening of the drain from the building, and as the excavation was all in rock it took until the 21st July to complete it. Sheraton also asked the plaintiff to build a vault which he agreed to do if Sheraton would supply the doors, which he agreed to do, but failing to do so the plaintiff did not build the vault. He said further that it was after the middle of July that Sheraton made to him the proposition of which he spoke as to certain improvements to be indicated by him to cost about $1,000, and that plaintiff declined to make the advance for him. He said, further, that they both went on with their respective work upon the premises, Sheraton continually making suggestions to the plaintiff, until the 13th of August, on which day news came of Sheraton's failure to make arrangements with his creditors, and Sheraton knocked off his work as soon as he heard this news and never did any more, and the next day, namely, the 14th August, served plaintiff with the notice of that date. The plaintiff further said that at the time of his receipt of this notice the rear building was finished with the exception of some windows which had not yet been all put in, and that all plaintiff's work was completed except the stairs, which were not yet put up, and some other matters of a very trifling nature, and he said that upon receipt of the notice he went the next day to Sheraton and asked him what he meant by the notice; he said,\nI said to him, Sheraton, that note you wrote I can hardly tell what the meaning is, and I have taken it to my lawyer, and he advised me to come up and ask you if you want me to go on with the work or knock off; and he said, \"I do not want to stop work,\" and I was going off with that, and then I asked him if he wanted me to go on with the work, and then he would not say anything one way or the other, and I went away.\nThe plaintiff, however, resolved to go on with the work. One Wetmore, who had a contract for the stairs, went on with them, and the plaintiff with the little trifling things of which he spoke, and which were additional to what he had outlined in the lease. Substantially, all was completed on the 14th of August except the stairs and the windows in the rear building on Market Street. In the middle of September the stairs and everything were completed except the windows in one row on the lower flat of the building on Market Street, which were not put in because Sheraton wanted to have doors there instead but had not gotten a permit from the city, which was necessary for the purpose, so plaintiff securely boarded up the spaces and finally, in the middle of September, left the premises and Sheraton in exclusive occupation thereof, which he did not leave until the 29th of October, when, as he himself said, \"I then went out taking everything with me.\"\nI have thus extracted the whole of the evidence which appears to me to have been at all material.\nAt the close of the evidence the learned counsel for the plaintiff contended, among other things, that under the terms of the lease the plaintiff had a right to enter for the purpose of making the contemplated improvements at any time before the first day of July, 1883, and that he was entitled to a reasonable time to make the improvements, taking into consideration the nature and character of the improvements.\nThis contention was overruled, as it needs must have been by the judge presiding at the trial upon the authority of the judgment of the Supreme Court granting the new trial; the question is, however, now open before us upon this appeal. Then he contended that if not entitled to the rent for the two quarters ending on first November, 1883, and the first of February, 1884, he was, at all events, entitled to the latter; and, further, that the evidence was uncontradicted that the plaintiff was continuing his work with Sheraton's consent from the 1st of July until the 14th of August, and that being so he was entitled to remain, if necessary, for the completion of his work, or at least until Sheraton should require him to leave; and that his offering to leave on receiving the letter of the 14th of August, if Sheraton desired it, was all that was required; and he insisted that there was no intention on the part of the plaintiff to deprive Sheraton of the use of any portion of the premises; that the plaintiff was remaining merely to complete work he had undertaken; that Sheraton did not complain of his being there, and did not seek to make any beneficial use of the premises on which plaintiff was working until such work should be completed; that when the entry is lawful the mere remaining beyond a specified time for the purpose of completing work, to perform which the entry was made, is no eviction and that the non-completion of work by a landlord within a specified time agreed upon is no answer to a claim for rent reserved, but is the subject only of a cross-action; and he asked the learned judge to charge the jury that to constitute eviction there must be something of a grave and permanent character done by the landlord with the intention of depriving the tenant of the enjoyment of the demised premises.\nThe learned judge charged the jury that after the 1st of July the plaintiff had no right to set a foot upon the property, and continue upon it, without the consent of Sheraton; that the right which he had under the terms of the lease was a right reserved to go in between the 1st of May and the 1st of July and make improvements; but that they had to be done by the 1st of July, and that if they were not completed, then he had no right to continue making them after the 1st of July without the consent of Sheraton, and upon this point, he said[17]:\nAnd he left it to the jury to say whether or not the occupation the plaintiff had, after the 1st of July, was with the consent of Sheraton or without his consent, and that if he did not consent, and the plaintiff went on doing the acts he did after the 1st of July, claiming he had a right to do it, then that would amount to an eviction; and he added that according to the view Mr. Gilbert, the plaintiffs counsel, took of the law, it would have to be done with the intention of depriving the tenant of the enjoyment of the property, but the learned judge said:\u2014\nThat necessarily follows if a landlord claims a right to go in and make improvements, and his going in deprives the tenant of the benefical use and occupation of the property, it seems to me that satisfies all the law requires to make out an eviction.\nHe then submitted certain questions to the jury upon their answers to which he would enter the verdict reserving leave to plaintiff's counsel to move to enter a verdict for the plaintiff, so that he might have an opportunity of moving the court upon all his points, and that the right of the parties should be reserved for the consideration of the court, and the verdict properly entered accordingly. The questions submitted the jury were as follows:\u2014\n1. Was the property fit to be occupied for the purpose for which Sheraton leased it between the 1st of August, and the 1st of November, 1883?\n2. Was the property fit to be occupied between the 1st November, 1883, and the 1st February, 1884?\n3. Did the plaintiff continue his work on the property after the 1st of July with the consent of Sheraton?\nIn submitting this question, he said:\u2014\nThis is the important question, they (that is Sheraton and the plaintiff) are directly opposed to each other, and you must judge between them which is the most likely to be correct. It is always a hard matter to do, but you must find against one party or the other\u2014see which is most probable.\n4. Did Sheraton agree that the plaintiff might have till the 1st of October to complete his work on the property?\n5. Did the defendant, in August, 1883, assent to or request the plaintiff to remain and finish the work?\nAfter submitting these questions to the jury the learned counsel for the defendant asked that the following question might be submitted to the jury, and the learned judge submitted it without any further comment or directions in addition to what he had already said in his charge to the jury.\n6. Did Sheraton consent, after giving the notice of the 14th August, that the plaintiff should continue on and do the work?\nEvery one of these questions, the jury answered in the negative, whereupon a verdict was entered by direction of the learned judge for the defendant, reserving leave to the plaintiff to move the court to have a verdict entered for the plaintiff for the whole amount claimed, or for such part, if any, as the court above should think fit, as had been agreed between the parties.\nIn pursuance of the case so reserved the plaintiff's counsel moved the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in the following term to enter a verdict for the plaintiff for the full amount claimed, namely, $1,400, being two quarters rent, or at least for $700, being the quarters rent from the 1st of August to the 1st of November, on the ground that the tenancy being admitted, and the amount of rent also, and the non-payment thereof, and the defence being \"eviction\" by the landlord, the acts of the landlord relied on by the defendant as constituting an eviction are not such acts as in law amount to an eviction, and, therefore, the pleas are not sustained; or, for a new trial for misdirection, and that the verdict is against law and evidence, and the weight of evidence.\nUpon that motion, the Supreme Court of New Brunswick made the rule following:\nOn hearing Mr. Gilbert Q.C. in support of an application fora rule to set aside the verdict for the defendant in this cause, and enter a verdict for the plaintiff pursuant to leave reserved, or for a new trial and Mr. Gregory on the same side, and upon hearing Mr. F. E. Barker Q.C. contra, and Mr. Gilbert in reply, and the court having taken time to consider, it is ordered that the rule to set aside the verdict for the defendant, and to enter a verdict for the plaintiff, or for a new trial be refused.\nIt is from this rule of the court that the present appeal is taken. In the view of the points specially submitted to the court by the learned counsel for the plaintiff at the trial, and in view of the leave reserved upon the agreement of the parties that the whole case should be reserved, so that the rights of the parties might be determined by the court, and the verdict entered accordingly, the whole of the matters in controversy, including those specified in the motion in relation to a new trial, arise and are involved in the motion made upon the leave reserved.\nNow there can be no doubt, I think, that the contention of the learned counsel for the plaintiff at the trial was well founded, namely, that the evidence was uncontradicted, and, in fact, was that of Sheraton himself, that between the 1st July and the 14th August the plaintiff was doing the work he was engaged in on the demised premises with the approbation or consent of Sheraton, within the meaning of the clause in the lease in that respect, even assuming the true construction of the lease to be that put upon it by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick when granting the new trial, and which was also the construction which the learned Chief Justice, who tried the case, put upon the terms of the lease.\nSheraton, it is true, denied having given any \"verbal consent,\" but the manned in which he gave that evidence, and the stress which he always laid upon the word \"verbal,\" when denying having given his consent to the plaintiff remaining at his work on the premises, showed a manifest intention to qualify his denial, and seemed to convey the impression that he himself well knew that the plaintiff's so remaining was not against the will of Sheraton, but was with his approbation and implied consent. A slight consideration of some of the evidence thus given by Sheraton will show that the only inference possible to be deduced from facts of which he gave evidence was, that in remaining on the premises continuing to carry on the work in which he was engaged the plaintiff was doing so with the approbation and consent of Sheraton, although he may have been dissatisfied with the progress the plaintiff was making; and that, in fact, the plaintiff's so continuing with his work was so much in the interest, and for the benefit, of Sheraton that if he had not done so Sheraton would have had just ground of complaint against the plaintiff, and it might be for very heavy damages.\nSheraton says that some time in the month of July he told the plaintiff, while the latter was carrying on his work on the demised premises, that it would be worth a great deal of money to him to have the premises completed at the time of an exhibition which was to take place in the following October; that he told the plaintiff several times in the month of July that he was most anxious that all should be done in time for this exhibition; that he impressed this repeatedly on the plaintiff, and that it never would be done at the rate plaintiff was going on; and to this language of his, he said, the plaintiff repeatedly said he would have it done in time; and Sheraton was not prepared to say that something of the like was not said in August also. Then, again, it was while the plaintiff's work was in progress in July that Sheraton told the plaintiff of an alteration he, Sheraton, proposed making in the front window which the plaintiff had taken out in order to get at the rear to erect the rear building in lieu of the old wooden one; and that he asked the plaintiff if his, Sheraton's, order for the glass which would be required for that alteration could be included in an order of plaintiff's. It was in July also while the plaintiff's work was in progress (both that indicated in the lease, and other work, namely, the water closets which Sheraton admitted the plaintiff had undertaken at his request, and the deepening of the drain necessary therefor, and the excavation of the cellar which, although he denied in one place that it was executed at his request, yet says in another, \"I think there was an agreement as to the cellars, there was as to the water closets), that Sheraton made the proposition to the plaintiff that if the plaintiff would spend $1,000 on such improvements as Sheraton should indicate he would pay the plaintiff 10 per cent. thereon.\nSheraton further said that he himself, at work which he had to do, and the plaintiff at the work he was doing, went on executing their respective work throughout July and into the month of August, until, in fact, about the 14th of August, when first he conceived the idea of leaving the premises and sent to plaintiff the notice of that date, and during all this time he said that he could not say he had ever made any objection to plaintiff remaining on the premises at the work he had in progress save remonstrating with him on the time he was taking, in other words, remonstrating with him on what appeared to Sheraton to be the slow progress he was making, and urging him to use greater expedition in order to have the premises completed at the time of the exhibition in October, and being asked what remained to be done on the 14th August (when the idea of leaving the premises first occurred to him), of the work the plaintiff was doing, all that he could specify was that the stairs had to be built.\nNow, upon this evidence, it is very clear that the case did not turn simply upon the question whether Sheraton or the plaintiff was telling the truth, the former in asserting that he had never given his verbal consent to the plaintiff continuing with his work after the first of July or the latter in asserting that express verbal consent was given by Sheraton, first for four months, that is to the 1st September which was afterwards extended to the 1st October, and the learned Chief Justice, who tried the case, therefore erred in so submitting the case to the jury, and resting it as he did in very distinct terms upon the view the jury might take of the veracity of Sheraton and the plaintiff respectively upon this single point. He should, in my opinion, have drawn the attention of the jury in a marked manner to the above points which I have extracted from Sheraton's evidence, and have told them that his \"approbation or consent\" within the terms of the lease could be implied from Sheraton's acts and conduct equally as if an express verbal consent had undoubtedly been given as sworn to by the plaintiff; and that the acts and conduct of Sheraton above referred to, and admitted and testified by himself, were abundantly sufficient to establish such approbation and consent. It is, in my opinion, inconceivable that upon such a charge any jury could be found to render a verdict that the plaintiff had remained at his work subsequently to the first of July tortiously and against the will of Sheraton, or otherwise than with his approbation and consent. No jury could be so obtuse as to pronounce the plaintiff to have been continuing with his work all through the month of July and into the month of August tortiously to Sheraton and against his will, when the latter was, as he admits he was, during that period, repeatedly telling the plaintiff that he, Sheraton, was most anxious to have all done in time for the exhibition in October, and urging the plaintiff to go on more expeditiously than he appeared to Sheraton to be doing in order that all should be done by that time, and when, during the same period while the plaintiff's work was in progress, Sheraton was asking the plaintiff to do for him, at a cost of $1,000, other work which Sheraton himself wanted to have done but which the plaintiff had not contemplated doing or undertaken to do; and when the plaintiff, also during the same period, was at Sheraton's request doing other work upon the premises than that indicated in the lease, which increased the cost to the plaintiff and caused delay in the progress of his work; for this is the substance of Sheraton's evidence as I have extracted it. A verdict rendered upon such evidence, pronouncing the continuance of the plaintiff at his work to have been, at any time subsequently to the 1st July, against the will of Sheraton, and tortious to him, could not possibly be permitted to stand. The contention of the learned counsel for the plaintiff was therefore well founded, to the effect that it was established by uncontradicted evidence, and that the evidence of Sheraton himself, that during all the time between the 1st of July and the fourteenth of August the continuance of the plaintiff on the demised premises, carrying on the works in which he was there engaged, was beyond all question with the approbation aud consent of Sheraton. Under these circumstances it was quite irrelevant whether or not Sheraton after the 14th of August gave any further consent, for the learned Chief Justice stated his opinion to be, in which opinion I entirely concur, that if the plaintiff was working at the demised premises after the 1st of July, with the permission of Sheraton, that permission would continue and the plaintiff would be entitled to proceed with his work until the permission should be revoked and so countermanded. And this does not appear to have been ever done. The notice of the 14th August certainly did not do so; that notice simply insists upon an eviction of Sheraton having been already committed by the plaintiff, for which contention there was not in reality, as I have already shown, any foundation. Sheraton's complaints up to that time had not taken the shape of any objection to the plaintiff being upon the demised premises carrying on his work but were pointed solely to what Sheraton considered to be the \"very slow and dilatory manner,\" as he called it in his evidence, in which the plaintiff had been proceeding with his work; and he asserts in the notice that the non-completion of the work had already caused him great damage for which he would hold the plaintiff responsible. This intimation, instead of amounting to a prohibition to the plaintiff completing his work, would seem rather to be given by way of urging the plaintiff to expedite the completion of his work, further delay in which would naturally be calculated to enhance any claim for damages which Sheraton might have against the plaintiff by reason of delay in the completion by him of his work; all of which that then remained unfinished, as specified by Sheraton himself was, as we have seen, the stairs. Again, Sheraton said that he could not remember whether or not he had had a conversation with the plaintiff in relation to the contents of the notice upon the 14th of August or the next day. After that time he said \"I was acting under the advice of counsel and held my tongue,\" and he did not remember the plaintiff asking him if he wanted the plaintiff to stop working, adding \"for the place would not be of much use to me if he stopped work;\" and the question being repeated and pressed whether he had not some conversation with the plaintiff in relation to the notice of the 14th August within a day or two after that date his only answer was, \"I do not remember,\" and \"I do not think I replied anything to him at all, as I was then acting under the advice of my counsel.\" The plaintiff, in his evidence, says that he had a conversation with Sheraton, which he detailed, within a day after the receipt by him of the notice, and that in that conversation he asked Sheraton if he wished him (the plaintiff) to knock off work, and that Sheraton replied he did not want to stop work, and that plaintiff asked him if he wished the plaintiff to go on with the work. This is the time probably which is alluded to by Sheraton when he said, \"I was acting under the advice of counsel and held my tongue,\" for the plaintiff says that to that question Sheraton would not say anything one way or other. But laying aside the plaintiff's statement of the occurrence, and resting wholly upon Sheraton's evidence as I have done as to the work done in July, it is quite clear that Sheraton never did direct, or apparently wish, the plaintiff to proceed no further with his work after the 14th of August, or at any time; and that he entertained the opinion that not his proceeding with his work to completion, but his ceasing to do so, or delay in doing so, would have the effect of doing injury to him, for, as he himself observed, \"the place would not be of much use to me if plaintiff stopped his work.\" The plaintiff accordingly did proceed with his work, and according to his own evidence, which is not in any respect disputed, he completed all that he intended doing by the middle of September, and left Sheraton in exclusive possession of the whole of the demised premises, and it is not pretended that from that time the plaintiff entered upon any part of the demised premises, or in any manner interfered with Sheraton's exclusive occupation of any part thereof during any part of the period for which the rent which is the subject of this action accrued due.\nIt was also quite irrelevant to the issue between the parties whether or not the property was fit to be occupied for the purpose for which Sheraton leased it between the 1st of August and 1st of Nov., 1883, and between the 1st of Nov., 1883, and the 1st of February, 1884. There can be no doubt that the premises could not have been wholly occupied for the purpose for which Sheraton had leased them while the necessary repairs and improvements were in progress, both those which the plaintiff was engaged in making and those which Sheraton himself had to do in order to put the premises into that condition which was necessary for the complete enjoyment by Sheraton of the whole of the demised premises, but the plaintiff could not in any form of action be made responsible for any defect in the condition of the premises which could be attributed to the default of Sheraton himself, and that he had himself been in default in respect of the repairs and improvements he had to make, and was making, in order to put the premises into such a condition that he could beneficially enjoy them, there can be no doubt; for, from the 14th August, he ceased proceeding with the work in which he was then engaged and never did any more, having then conceived the idea, which he subsequently carried into effect, of wholly abandoning the premises. Moreover, the mere fact of the premises being in a bad condition during the period named could not itself afford any evidence of the plaintiff having evicted Sheraton from any part of the demised premises and having kept him evicted therefrom during the whole of the period named, all which is averred by the defendant in his pleas of eviction, and all is necessary to be proved in order to afford any defence to this action, for in the case of an eviction from a part of demised premises if that part be restored to the tenant before the falling due of the current rent at the time of eviction the rent as reserved by the lease is payable. In the present case it is undisputed that the plaintiff, by the middle of September, 1883, completed all the repairs and improvements he contemplated making, the nature and extent of which was by the express terms of the lease left entirely and unreservedly to his judgment and decision, and that he then wholly abandoned any occupation which he ever had of any part of the demised premises, and thenceforward Sheraton had uninterrupted occupation of the whole of the said premises without any let or hindrance of the plaintiff. By abandoning such occupation Sheraton could not determine the tenancy or get rid of his obligation under his covenant to pay rent and to keep the premises, after the improvements should be made, both those of the said plaintiff and of Sheraton himself, in good and sufficient repair and condition. The defendant, therefore, has wholly failed to establish that he is discharged from liability as to any part of the rent sued for by reason of the defence of eviction set up in his pleas. It was argued before us that even though there was no eviction, nevertheless, the defendant was released and discharged from his guarantee by reason of the matters pleaded in the third of the pleas above set out, but such a case does not appear to have been urged at the trial, where the whole case was rested upon the alleged eviction; and indeed, in point of law there is no foundation for the contention before us that the defendant could be released and discharged from his guarantee by the matters therein alleged, assuming them to be true, for the defendant's guarantee is to pay the rent covenanted to be paid by the tenant during the continuance of the term demised by the lease, or so much thereof as the tenant should make default in paying, and nothing can discharge or release the defendant from this his covenant unless it be an actual release executed to himself, or such acts and conduct of the lessor towards his tenant as should constitute a discharge or suspension of the rent as regards him, and the plea avers nothing which constitutes a determination of the tenancy or a discharge or suspension of the rent as reserved by the lease and payable by the tenant. If there was no eviction, there was no suspension of rent and no discharge of the liability of the defendant under his covenant to pay so much of the rent reserved by the lease as the tenant should make default in paying. So that in fact the whole case rested, as it was treated at the trial to rest, upon the question of eviction.\nIn the view which I have taken it may be unnecessary to determine whether or not the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick is well founded, which, as I understand it, in substance declares the continuance by the plaintiff upon the demised premises after the 1st of July without Sheraton's consent, although for the sole and actual purpose of continuing to completion the repairs and improvements outlined in the lease and already commenced, would constitute an eviction in law and suspension of the rent. But I am of opinion that judgment cannot be supported. The judgment seems to me to go farther than any case hitherto decided, and I do not think that the court has given sufficient consideration to the fact that the plaintiff had really no more possession of the demised premises, or of any part thereof, than he would have had if he had been a mere stranger executing the work he was engaged in under a contract with Sheraton and, in such case, such possession could hardly be held to be sufficient to be the basis upon which eviction could be rested; so, likewise, I think it did not receive sufficient consideration that Sheraton was himself equally in possession of the same part of the demised premises as was the plaintiff, and for the like purpose of making repairs and improvements equally necessary for the beneficial enjoyment by him of the demised premises as were those which the plaintiff was making, so that it appears to me to be difficult to conceive what particular act of the plaintiff constituted an eviction of Sheraton from premises upon which and upon the same part of which he was himself making necessary repairs and improvements, equally as was the plaintiff.\nFor the above reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and a rule be ordered to issue in the court below setting aside the verdict for the defendant and directing a verdict and judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for the full amount of the two quarters rent claimed, namely, $1,400, together with interest thereon from the commencement of action, and costs of suit.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014Robert E. Ferguson, the plaintiff, made a lease to Alfred B. Sheraton, dated the sixth of May, 1882, demising premises in the City of St. John for a term of ten years to commence on the first of May, 1883, at the yearly rent of $2,800, payable in quarterly instalments of $700. The defendant became surety for Sheraton. This action is brought to recover from the defendant, as such surety, two quarters' rent which fell due, according to the terms of the lease, on the first of November, 1883, and the first of February, 1884.\nThe defence relied on is that before either of these gales of rent became due the plaintiff evicted Sheraton from the demised premises, or that he evicted him from a part of the premises and Sheraton gave up possession of the rest.\nAt the trial of the action certain questions were given in writing to the jury and were answered in writing. The learned Chief Justice who presided at the trial directed a verdict for the defendant with leave to move. The plaintiff moved to have the verdict entered for him or for a new trial. His grounds are fully set out in his notice of motion which I shall refer to by and by. The motion was refused, and this appeal is from that decision.\nThere are some provisions in the lease to Sheraton which I find by no means easy to understand. They have been the occasion of much of the difficulties that have led to this litigation. There is a covenant by the lessee to yield up at the expiration of the lease\u2014\nAll and singular the premises and all future erections, additions and improvements that may be made to and upon the same during the term of this agreement in as good order and condition in all respects\u2014damage by fire and other unavoidable casualties alone excepted\u2014as the same now are or may be put into by the said Robert E. Ferguson or his legal representatives, provided the said Robert E. Ferguson or his legal representatives do actually make the improvements hereinafter outlined.\nNothing turns directly on this proviso which, as expressed, would seem to qualify the whole covenant. It would probably have to be read as touching only the subject immediately preceding it, viz., improvements made by the lessor, and it might be necessary so to understand it to make it consistent with the covenant to repair which comes farther on in the deed.\nFollowing the proviso there is this remarkable stipulation:\u2014\nIt is hereby mutually agreed upon by and between the parties hereto that the said Robert E. Ferguson and his legal representatives, agents and servants, if he or they should think proper or expedient, may enter upon the said land and premises herein demised for the purpose of repairing, altering or improving the same or any part thereof, at any time either between the date of this indenture and the 1st day of May, 1883, and for two months thereafter, but not after that time except with the approbation or consent of the said party of the second part or his legal representatives. It is also to be fully and clearly understood by and between the parties hereto that the nature and extent of any repairs, alterations or improvements which the said Robert E. Ferguson or his legal representatives may make upon the said land and premises is to be left and is left entirely and unreservedly to the judgment and decision of the said Robert E. Ferguson and his legal representatives. (But the said Robert E. Ferguson may here state in outline (in parenthesis) what his present intentions are as to said alterations, repairs and improvements, namely, that he intends\u2014)\ngoing on to specify works of considerable extent in removing structures, building others, altering, draining, &c., &c., and adding the following, which is what I have spoken of as the covenant to repair:\nIt is to be understood also that the said Alfred B. Sheraton and his legal representatives are to make at his and their own expense and risk any and all improvements and repairs which he or they may require during the term of this lease in or upon the said demised premises, over and above what the said Robert E. Ferguson and his legal representatives may make, as above indicated, and to keep the said premises, after such improvements are made, both those of said Robert E. Ferguson and his representatives, and Alfred B. Sheraton and his representatives, in good and sufficient repairs and condition during the term of this lease.\nWhen the lease was made the premises, on which were two shops, were let to other tenants, T. & H. Likely having one shop and one Warwick the other. The terms expired only on the 1st May, 1883, when Sheraton's term was to begin. The parties to the lease apparently contemplated the possibility of the lessor doing part or the whole of his projected work on the premises during the existing terms of Likely and Warwick. The provision which, in form, imports a consent by Sheraton to his lessor entering upon the other tenants looks rather anomalous, but probably takes that aspect only from being inartificially expressed. Its purpose may have been to preclude any objection on Sheraton's part to the alteration of the premises between the execution of the deed and the commencement of the term, as well as for at least two months longer.\nFor the plaintiff it has been argued that the limit of the two months from the first of May, 1883, was only in respect of the entry to commence the improvements, and that, having entered within that time, or afterwards with the consent of the lessee, the lessor was authorized to remain in occupation as long as might be reasonably necessary to carry the works to completion. There is, to my mind, a good deal in favor of that reading of the deed. The language employed\u2014\"if he or they should think proper or expedient to enter upon,\" &c., \"at any time either between,\" &c.\u2014bears strongly in that direction. It would have been easy to say that whatever works the lessor decided upon must be completed within the limited time, if that was what was meant. I see no good reason for inferring that a joint occupation by the lessor and lessee was contemplated.\nThe lessee could not well occupy the premises for the purpose of his business while the outlined improvements, or, at all events, while some of them, were in progress. The entry permitted by the agreement I should take to be practically, or for business purposes, an exclusion of the lessee, and I do not take the entry to be repeated from day to day while the improvements were going on. The lessor was at liberty to enter for the purpose of making the improvements. When they were made he would, of course, withdraw, but in the meantime there would not be repeated entries\u2014the entry was once for all. One is inclined to ask: Why, if the tenant is excluded from the use of the premises while the landlord is making his improvements, should he continue to pay rent? The question does not touch the point of the construction of the permission to enter. Rent was to be paid for the whole term. Some part of the term, be it two months or more, was to be, or might be, occupied by the works done by the landlord. The tenant would enjoy the advantage of the improvements without increase of rent, but he was to pay rent for the whole term.\nThe plaintiff lost no time in beginning his building operations as soon as the tenancy of Likely and Warwick expired, but he did not finish them within the two months. I understand the evidence to be that he had not completed all that he had proposed to do even in February, 1884, but there is evidence that he had ceased work on the premises sometime in September, 1883.\nThe quarter's rent due on the 1st of August, 1883, was paid on the fourteenth of that month, the tenant giving at the same time the written notice that he claimed that the conduct of the plaintiff amounted to an eviction and that the rent was suspended; but the tenant, who had himself been making some alterations, did not retire from the premises until the end of October, two or three days before the November quarter's rent fell due.\nThe facts found by the jury, upon which the verdict for the defendant was directed, appear by the following questions put by the learned Chief Justice, and the answers appended by the jury.\n1. Was the property fit to be occupied for the purpose for which Sheraton leased it between the 1st August and the 1st November, 1883? It was not.\n2. Was the property fit to be so occupied between the 1st November, 1883, and 1st February, 1884? It was not.\n3. Did the plaintiff continue his work on the property after the 1st July with the consent of Sheraton? He did not.\n4. Did Sheraton agree that the plaintiff might have till the 1st October to complete his work on the property? He did not.\n5. Did the defendant (Troop) in August, 1883, assent to, or request the plaintiff to remain and finish the work? No. 6. Did Sheraton consent, after giving the notice of the 14th August, that the plaintiff should continue on and do the work? No.\nSome of these answers are palpably contrary to the evidence. No. 3 in particular is irreconcilable, to my mind, with the evidence of Sheraton himself, who was careful to say only that he gave no verbal consent. He seems to me to have given his testimony with fairness and candor, not attempting to disguise his consciousness that he was proving a very distinct consent at dates later than the 1st of July though he may not have given it in so many words, or, as he puts it, giving no verbal consent. I shall not, however, take up time by discussing the findings, but shall, for the purpose of this argument, accept them as they appear, because they stop short, in my judgment, of establishing the eviction on which the defence is based.\nThe plaintiff's notice of motion was in these terms:\u2014\nTAKE NOTICE, that the plaintiff will move the court, on the first day of Easter Term next, or as soon after as counsel can be heard, as by leave reserved, to enter a verdict for the plaintiff for the full amount claimed, i.e., $1,400, being two quarters' rent, or at least for $700, being the quarter's rent from the 1st of August to the 1st November, 1883.\nOn the ground\u2014\nThe tenancy being admitted and the amount of rent also and the non-payment thereof, and the defence being \"eviction\" by the landlord, the acts of the landlord relied on by the defendant as constituting an eviction, are not such acts as in law amount to an eviction, and therefore the pleas are not sustained.\nFailing above mentioned motion, motion will be made for a new trial, on the following grounds:\n1st. Misdirection.\n(a.) That the great and material question was: Whether or not after the 1st July, 1883, Mr. Ferguson had the right to continue and make improvements on the property.\n(b.) In directing that Ferguson was bound to have the improvements he indicated completed before the 1st July unless Sheraton consented to an extension of time.\n(c.) In not directing the jury that to constitute an eviction there must be something of a grave and permanent character done by the landlord with the intention of depriving the tenant of the enjoyment of the demised premises.\n(d.) In not directing the jury, that Ferguson having entered lawfully on the premises for the purpose of completing the indicated improvements, the mere remaining there for a longer period than the time contemplated for the purpose of completing the work he had commenced would not amount to an eviction, unless such remaining in was done with the intention of depriving the tenant of the enjoyment of the demised premises.\n(e.) In not directing the jury, that Ferguson having lawfully entered for the purpose of making the indicated improvements, if he merely remained there for a longer period solely for the purpose of completing the work he had commenced, and with no other ulterior view, such remaining beyond such time would not amount to an eviction.\n(f.) In not directing the jury, that as Ferguson had left the premises by the middle of September, Sheraton occupying a portion and noways hindered from occupying the whole from that time out, there could not be any eviction during the quarter from the 1st November to 1st February.\n(g.) In not directing the jury, that Ferguson having lawfully entered for the purpose of making the improvements he had indicated, the fact of his remaining longer than he contemplated was no answer to an action to recover the rent, but that if Sheraton had sustained damage thereby he had his remedy in an action for damages.\n(h.) In leaving to the jury the first and second questions, they being immaterial to the issues and tending to lead the jury to the conclusion that Ferguson was bound to complete all he had indicated, and to have them completed by the 1st July.\n(i.) In not leaving to the jury the question: \"Did Ferguson remain in contrary to Sheraton's wish after the 15th September?\"\nI am strongly inclined to the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to succeed upon all the grounds here taken. I do not propose to discuss them at any length, and I am sensible of the difficulties attending some of them, particularly as regards the construction of the two months limitation. If my view of that clause is correct no further question can be made on this record, whether Sheraton would or would not have any claim for damages or other relief by reason of any inconvenience or loss he may have been put to from the length of time taken up by the plaintiff's work. That time may or may not have been unreasonable. No question of fact on that subject was submitted to the jury.\nBut setting aside for the moment this disputed question of construction, and adopting the findings of the jury that negative any consent by Sheraton or by the defendant to the occupation of any part of the premises by the plaintiff after the first of July, I am unable to see that an eviction, working a suspension of the rent, is established.\nThe doctrines settled by the most recent decisions may be taken from Wm. Saunders[18], under Salmon v. Smith, where it is said:\nIt is now well settled that that sort of eviction [i.e., expulsion by title paramount or by process of law] is not necessary to constitute a suspension of the rent, because it is established that if the tenant loses the benefit of the enjoyment of any portion of the demised premises by the act of the landlord the whole rent is thereby suspended. An eviction may now be taken to mean this: not a mere trespass and nothing more, but something of a grave and permanent character done by the landlord with the intention of depriving the tenant of the enjoyment of the whole or of a portion of the demised premises. Therefore, the question of eviction or no eviction depends on the circumstances, and is in all cases to be decided by the jury.\nThe whole of this language is that of Jervis C.J. in Upton v. Townend[19] where the importance of the intent, as a fact found, is emphasized, as e.g.:\nIf that may, in law, amount to an eviction, the jury would very naturally cut the knot by finding whether or not the act done by the landlord is of that character, and done with that intention.\nThere is no finding of this crucial fact in the present case. It is not involved in any of the facts found, and if I correctly apprehend the charge of the learned Chief Justice as reported to us I think the necessity for it cannot have been present to his mind. After quoting from the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Palmer at a former stage of the case the learned Chief Justice went on to remark: \u2014 Now when he says permanent I do not understand that to mean permanent in this sense that it was to last as long as the lease lasted and put an end to it, but something that would deprive the tenant for a considerable time of the use and occupation of the property leased. If that was the effect of what Ferguson did, and it was done without the consent of Sheraton, well I should say that would amount in law to an eviction, because the tenant does not get what he was paying his rent for, because he does not get the beneficial occupation of the property for the term, let it be a quarter or less, or a month, and that would justify a jury in finding there was an eviction.\nNow, I take it to be indisputable that a tenant maybe deprived of the beneficial occupation of demised property for some part of his term by an act of the landlord which is wrongful as against his tenant but which does not necessarily amount to an eviction. Such an act may be what is spoken of in the passage quoted from the judgment of Jems C.J. as a mere trespass. It may be an act which is not technically a trespass, as in the case of an entry to do repairs of the nature, e.g., of those in Saner v. Bilton[20], but where, from the repairs occupying more time than anticipated, the tenant is kept out for an unreasonable time. The charge fails to distinguish such cases from acts which are not only of a grave and permanent character but which are also done with the intention of depriving the tenant of the enjoyment of the whole or of a portion of the demised premises. This oversight reappears in the judgment of the court in banc delivered by Mr. Justice Tuck, but there the fallacy is more in the application of the law than in the statement of the rule. After alluding to the former decision in the case which compelled the court to hold that the repairs and alterations were, by the terms of the lease, to be completed before the 1st of July, 1883, he said:\nThat being so, the next important question to determine is whether the plaintiff did upon the premises, after the first of July, what amounted to an eviction. That, in my opinion, was for the jury, with proper direction as to what in law would constitute an eviction. If by the lease the plaintiff was bound to have the improvements completed and the premises tenantable by the first of July, and he failed in this and continued to occupy and make repairs, so that Sheraton, without his consent, and as the inevitable result of the plaintiff's action, was deprived of the beneficial use and occupation of the whole or some part of the demised premises, this would be evidence upon which a jury would be warranted in finding an eviction. Such acts would be evidence of an intention to evict, for a person is presumed to intend what must be the natural result of his own action.\nThe cogent fact that the jury did not find, and were not asked to find, viz. whether or not there was an eviction, seems to be overlooked in these observations. The fact that the tenant was deprived of the enjoyment of the premises or of some part of them by the act of the landlord would, no doubt, be a fact admissible in evidence on the issue as to the intent with which the act was done, but it would be only one fact to be considered by the jury along with all the other evidence that bore on the issue.\nThere is no conclusive presumption from a certain effect following an act, or even necessarily following it, that the act was done with the intention to produce that effect. In this case, if the question had been left to the jury, with a proper direction as to the importance of the motive or intention, I should not anticipate a finding that the alleged acts were done with the intention of depriving the tenant of the enjoyment of the premises. The motive in entering on the first or second of May cannot be said to be in controversy. It was obviously for the purpose provided by the lease; and while one cannot say that the jury might not see or suppose there were reasons for attributing the delay in completing the works to a design to keep the tenant out, and not to accidental or unforeseen causes or honest miscalculations, or to the extension of the works in some respects at the instance of the tenant, of which there is evidence, I should not expect the former view to be taken. The evidence, as I read it, taking even that of Mr. Sheraton by itself, greatly preponderates in favor of the latter conclusion. I go so far as to consider that the issue of eviction or no eviction might properly have been withdrawn from the jury on the ground that the entry was in accordance with the terms of the lease, and that there was not, under the circumstances, evidence on which they could reasonably find that the prolonged occupation of the premises by the plaintiff was with the intention of depriving the tenant of the enjoyment of them.\nIt is only repeating what I have already said to remark that this holding does not touch the right of the tenant to compensation for loss or inconvenience which the landlord may have caused and may be unable to justify. Even in case of an eviction the tenant has that remedy in addition to the suspension of the rent, as was pointed out by Coltman J. in Morrison v. Chadwick[21].\nSome proceedings on the part of the tenant Sheraton which have been proved in evidence have no bearing that I can perceive on the issue in the action, at least in favor of the defendant. The payment of the August rent when, if the finding of the jury has the effect attributed to it, the eviction took place in July certainly does not help the defence. The first inference from it, an inference pretty clearly indicated by direct evidence, that of Sheraton as well as others, is that Sheraton assented to what is now called an entry after the 1st July. I do not understand on what principle the contention which runs through the defence is based that a consent to exceed the time relied on as the limit under the lease, and not itself limited to any definite time, could be recalled at the will of the tenant so as to make the continuance of the operations an eviction. Nor do I appreciate the importance attached by the defence to the fact of Sheraton having quitted the premises in October, 1883. The suspension of the rent, if there was any eviction from part of the premises, was anterior to and irrespective of the abandonment of the premises by the tenant, while at the same time the lease continued to subsist after the abandonment as well as before it. Morrison v. Chadwick[22]. I should be disposed to ascribe these proceedings rather to the business difficulties that are said to have occurred to Sheraton in or about the month of August, 1883, than to any apprehension of their advantage with regard to the lease from the plaintiff. Those are, however, matters aside from the questions before us.\nOn the grounds that on the correct construction of the lease the continuance of the plaintiff's occupation of the premises for the purpose of the additions and alterations for a reasonable time after the 1st July, 1883, was not wrongful; and that even if that be not the correct construction of the document, there has been no eviction shown or found by the jury; I am of opinion that the rule asked for by the plaintiff ought to have been granted and judgment given him for the amount claimed with costs, and that we should allow the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: A.

An order made by a judge of the court appealed from giving defendants \"leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada leaving it to plaintiffs to dispute the right of appeal in the Supreme Court,\" even if considered as an enlargement of the time for giving notice, will not give the court jurisdiction if no notice is given pursuant to such enlargement.\nThe time for giving notice under s. 41 can be extended as well after as before the twenty days have elapsed.\nHeld per Strong J.\u2014In s. 42 of the act, providing that under special circumstances the court appealed from or a judge thereof may \"allow an appeal\" although the time limited therefor by previous sections has expired, the expression \"allow an appeal\" means only that the court or judge may settle the case and approve the security.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick refusing to set aside a verdict of the plaintiffs and order a non-suit or new trial.\nThis was an action originally brought against one Henry Vaughan which was tried at a circuit court in New Brunswick, and resulted in a verdict for the plaintiffs. The defendant moved to have the verdict set aside and a non-suit or new trial ordered. In May, 1889, judgment was pronounced refusing the motion. The defendant had died in October, 1888, and probate of his will was granted in the same month, but no suggestion of his death being entered upon the record the judgment on defendant's motion was ordered to be entered as of a date prior to October, 1888. The solicitor for the defendant did not obtain authority from the executors to appeal from the judgment on his motion in time to give notice of appeal within twenty days from the time that judgment was pronounced. When the authority was obtained he applied to a judge of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, not for an extension of the time to give notice, but for leave to appeal, and the following order was made:\u2014\n\"I do order that the defendants have leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada in this cause leaving it to the plaintiffs to dispute the right of appeal in the Supreme Court of Canada.\"\nNo notice of appeal was given under this order though some time before it was made a notice was given in the name of the original defendant.\nThe cause was inscribed for hearing before the Supreme Court of Canada, and the plaintiffs having given notice of their intention to do so, moved to have the appeal quashed for want of notice under sections 41 of the Supreme Court Act[1].\nWeldon Q.C. and Hazen supported the motion.\nC. A. Palmer contra.\nSir W. C. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014I am sorry that I cannot agree with the view of my brother Patterson. This is a question of our jurisdiction under the statute, and we have always been very particular before hearing an appeal to satisfy ourselves that we have a right to hear it. In this case I think the jurisdiction is entirely wanting, for notwithstanding all my brother Patterson says, in respect to the order being in effect an extension of the time, and even supposing that it is so, the very ingredient is wanting to give us jurisdiction, namely, the notice itself. Can we say that an appeal will lie in this case in direct opposition to the statute which expressly declares that no such appeal shall lie unless the notice provided for is given? We are without jurisdiction for want of notice, not for want of the time being extended. The extension that should have been asked for was an extension of the time to give the notice, not of time to appeal.\nI do not agree with the Supreme Court of New Brunswick that notice cannot be given under section 41 of the act after the twenty days' have expired, for this court has held the contrary; but in all cases it is necessary that the notice shall be given. It must be given in a case such as this within twenty days from the time that judgment is pronounced, for we have held that in common law cases the time runs from the pronouncing of the judgment. A different rule prevails in equity causes where the minutes have to be settled before judgment can be entered.\nThis judgment was pronounced in May, 1889; the original defendant died and his will was proved in October, 1888; no suggestion of his death was entered for some months after which was not the fault of the attorney, but of his clients, who had ample time to consider as to whether they should wish to appeal or not in case judgment was given against them, but who took no steps for two months after it was pronounced. From the first of June, 1889, they had an opportunity to apply to extend the time but did not do so. When the application was made Mr. Justice Tuck made the following order:\u2014\nI do order that the said defendants have leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada in this cause, leaving it to the plaintiffs to dispute the rights of appeal in the Supreme Court of Canada. I read that order differently from the way it was read by my brother Patterson; I read it that Judge Tuck gave leave to appeal and left it to this court to say whether due notice was given and the appeal thereby perfected or not, and left it entirely open to the respondents to show that the necessary steps had not been taken, that is, that notice had not been given under section 41 nor the time extended for giving it.\nI therefore think we have no jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. I should have preferred to allow the matter to stand over to enable the appellant to make an application to the court below to extend the time he paying the costs of the motion, but the majority of the court think that the appeal must be quashed and doing so will work no particular injury to the appellants who will not be prevented thereby from still making the application.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I agree in what has been said by the Chief Justice. It is incumbent on the appellants to bring themselves within the provisions of section 41 of the statute, and nothing done by a judge of the court below can preclude the respondent from objecting that notice was not given, as required by that section, within twenty days after the decision appealed from or such further time as the court or a judge may allow. Mr Palmer has not insisted, and could not upon the affidavits before us have insisted, that the provision referred to has been complied with. Not only was no notice given within the prescribed time of twenty days, but even if we were to consider the allowance of the security to operate as an enlargement of time (which, however, I am of opinion it was not) no notice of appeal was given pursuant to such enlargement.\nI am clearly of opinion that this objection is open in this court inasmuch as it is a matter for us to deal with as affecting our jurisdiction, and nothing that has been done by the court below can preclude us from entertaining it.\nThe 42nd section of the act authorises the court below under special circumstances, to \"allow an appeal\" though the time limited by the other provisions of the act has expired. I understand the expression \"allow an appeal\" simply to mean the settlement of the case and the approval of the security.\nThe appeal must be quashed, but as there is, according to decisions in this court and analogous English authorities, power to extend the time after the twenty days have elapsed, it would, if I may say so, seem to me not unreasonable that it should be done in this case; and I venture to express the hope that the court in New Brunswick, or a judge thereof, will see their way clear to granting an extension.\nFOURNIER J. concurred in the judgment quashing the appeal.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014It seems to me that the interpretation given to sec. 42 by my brother Patterson, though there is much force in it, would involve the repeal of that part of section 41 which says that notice shall be given. It appears by the order of the judge in the court below, and it is admitted, that no notice was given, and I cannot agree that section 42 does away with the necessity.\nSo far as appears before us from the order of the court below I think there is no jurisdiction, and I cannot see that under the circumstances the appellants are deserving of a great deal of consideration. In my opinion the only thing that we can do is to quash the appeal with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014It seems to me that the time has been extended in effect by the court below, and that the appeal is properly before this court. The objection made is a technical one which I do not think should prevail. The circumstances of the case were very peculiar. Judgment was pronounced two years after the argument of the rule. The defendant had then been dead for six or seven months, and the plaintiffs could not avail themselves of their judgment, there being no defendant, except by obtaining leave to enter judgment nunc pro tunc. If the time for giving notice were to count from the nominal time of entering the judgment there could have been no appeal. There is no question of surprise. Two notices of appeal were, in fact, given, but were ineffective because the executors had not been made parties to the record. By sec. 41 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act the court appealed from, or a judge thereof, may extend the time for giving notice. Here we have the judge's order approving of the security containing these words: \"I do order that the defendants have leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada in this cause.\" I take that to be a sufficient extension of the time; no form of order is prescribed. It is true, the judge adds, \"leaving it to the plaintiffs to dispute the right of appeal in the Supreme Court of Canada,\" but this, if not entirely nugatory as I think it is, may serve to allow this court to say that the appeal is before it. Section 42 gives power to allow an appeal under special circumstances after the time limited by the statute. It may not, in strictness, apply to this case, but the circumstances are certainly special, and would call for the exercise of the power under section 42, if it applied. I am not sure that it would not apply, but I think that there has been a sufficient extension under section 41.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: C. A. Palmer.\nSolicitors for respondents: Hazen & Straton.\n[1] R. S. C. ch. 135.\n"

RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I agree in the judgments prepared by Mr. Justice Taschereau in these cases.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I concur in the judgment which has been prepared by my brother Taschereau, and I only , desire to add a few words to guard against any misconstruction of my acquiescence in that judgment, as: it may be invoked as a precedent in future cases, \u2022 especially in cases arising in the Provinces subject to the English system of law.\nThe actions in the present case seek to make the trustees personally liable for the debts of the railway company incurred in the purchase of rolling stock. This I am clear, cannot be done and, therefore, \u00ed agree in dismissing the appeal. I also entirely concur in the view of my brother Taschereau as regards the loss of the vendor's privilege by reason of the cars and rolling stock having become, under the express provision of the law, immoveables by destination.\nWhat I desire to explain, however, is this. In assenting to the judgment of the court dismissing these appeals I do not by any means intend to preclude myself in future, should the question be raised in proper form and in an appropriate case, from considering whether the principle which is now universally recognised in the United States as to the applicability of current earnings to current expenses, incurred either whilst or before railway property comes under the control of the court by being placed at the instance of mortgagees in the hands of a receiver, in preference to mortgage creditors whose security has priority of date over the obligation thus incurred for working expenses, should be adopted by our courts. This doctrine is now firmly settled in the United States where railway mortgages exactly resemble those in use with us and which do not at all resemble the securities of debenture holders under the English system of securities for borrowed capital ; and the practice referred to is so pregnant with justice, good faith and equity that there may be found strong reasons for applying it here when the question arises. It certainly does not arise in the present case where the defendants are not receivers but trustees, and where it is sought to recover a personal judgment against them, which is entirely inadmissible.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014By the Quebec Act 43-44., Vic, ch. 49 (1880) the South Eastern Railway Company, being in financial difficulties was authorized to issue mort-gage bonds to a certain amount, and for the purpose of securing the payment of the same and interest thereon, to convey its railway, franchise and all its property, tolls and income to trustees to be named, when required, by the shareholders of the company.\nBy section 4 of the said act it was enacted that in any such deed of conveyance, the company and the trustees might stipulate as to who should have the possession, management and control of the said railway receive the tolls and income thereof, and dispose of them as well before as after default in the payment of said mortgage bonds or of the interest thereof, with power also to stipulate how. in case of such default, the company might be divested of all interest, equity of redemption claim or title to the said railway franchise, and other property so conveyed, and how the same might become vested absolutely in the said trustees in satisfaction of the said bonds.\nBy section 5, the said trustees were empowered, upon default in the payment of tie bonds, or of any interest coupons, to take possession of and run operate, manage and control the said railway as fully and effectually as the company might do the same. Section 7 enacts that the said conveyance shall he to all intents, valid, and create a first lien, privilege and mortgage upon the said railway.\nSection 10 enacts that neither the present proprietors of the said road, nor those contemplated under the said act, shall have the power to close or cease running the said road.\nOn the 12th August, 1881, mortgage bonds having been issued by the company a deed of trust was u executed by which the said railway was conveyed by the company to the present respondents as trustees, for the purpose of securing the payment of the said bonds, as contemplated by the said act. It was stipulated in the said deed that the company should remain in full possession of the said railway, as if the deed had not been passed, until ninety days after default of payment of said bonds or interest thereon after which ninety days the said trustees were empowered to enter into possession. The deed then provides that in case of default of payment, during six months, the trustees may become full owners of the road, after certain notices and lapse of time therein specified.\nThis deed was registered in March, 1884.\nUnder the terms of this deed the company continued in possession of the railway, until the 5th October, 1883. when interest on the said mortgage bonds being overdue for more than 90 days, upon the request of the said trustees, the company gave them up the possession and control of the railway, voluntarily and in good faith, as alleged in the appellant's declaration.\nThese trustees are the respondents in this court, defendants in the Superior Court. They are sued by the appellant for work done for and materials delivered to the company from the 9th of May, 1882 to September 20th, 1883, that is to say after the execution of the deed of trust aforesaid but before they, the trustees, came in possession on the 5th October, 1883.\nThey pleaded to this action, that they are not liable for the appellant's claim, and that there is no privity F of contract between them and the appellant. They also pleaded res judicata, but abandoned their contentions on that point at the hearing before us.\nThe Superior Court gave judgment for the appellant on the ground, \" that the deed of trust to the respondents constituted a pledge of this railway with the T statutory power, against the common law rules concerning pledges, to leave the pledge in the hands of the pledge as long as the interest on the bonds was paid as accrued, that as in law the pledger is bound to the preservation of the thing pledged, under Article 1973, Civil Code, the respondents, as such pledgees, were bound to satisfy the appellant's claim, which is for work and materials necessary for the working of the said railway.\"\nThe Court of Appeal reversed that judgment and dismissed the appellant's action upon the ground that the work done and the materials sold which he claims in his action were not furnished or done to or for the respondents, but to and for the company, to whom alone he had given credit\nThe appellant now appeals from this last judgment.\nSince the judgment of the Superior Court was given in this case, the Privy Council has, in a case of Redfield v. Wickham ([20]) given an authoritative opinion on the construction of the Quebec Statute of 1880, under which the respondents are now in possession of this railway. The only observation of their lordships, however, which can have any bearing on this present case is the following :\nTheir lordships do not doubt that the effect of the trust conveyance of 12th of August, 1881, followed by possession in terms of the deed' was to vest the property of the railway and its appurtenances in the appellants and to reduce the interest of the South Eastern Company to a bare right of redemption.\nThe appellants there were the trustees, respondents in the present case.\nThese remarks of their lordships however have perhaps, no direct application here, because, clearly, their lordships thereby refer solely to the conveyance to the trustees when followed by their possession, whilst the appellant's claim is for goods sold to the company when the company was still in possession, before the trustees exercised their right to take possession.\nThis raises the question not determined by the Privy Council, as to the nature and legal character of the possession by the company after the deed of trust of 1881 till the 5th October, 1883 ? A question which, of course I need consider here only as its solution may affect the present case.\nNow, conceding with the Superior court for the sake of argument, that the deed of 1881,as long as the company retained possession, constituted a pledge, (which, of course, implies that the company also remained proprietor,) it is evident that this pledge was not for the benefit and in the interest of the company's creditors generally, but only and exclusively for the benefit and in the interest of the mortgage bondholders. The appellant contends however, and the Superior Court gave countenance to that contention, that, as under article 1973, the debtor is obliged to repay to the creditor the necessary expenses incurred by him, the creditor, in the preservation of the thing pledged, the respondents are here liable towards him, the appellant, because such was the nature of the materials sold and the work done by him for the company. I cannot adopt this view of the case. It is true in fact and admitted in the record that the work done and materials sold by the appellant were necessary for the working of the railway ; but, assuming there was a contract of pledge, the company being allowed, exceptionally by the statute, to remain in possession of the thing pledged, though, at common law, the pledgee must have the possession, it follows that article 1973, can have no application whatever to the appellant's claim. In the first place it is not the creditor here who has incurred expenses for the preservation of the thing pledged by his debtor and still belonging to his debtor, but it is the debtor who, according to this theory, allowed to remain in possession of the thing pledged, has incurred the expenses for the preservation of his own property. In the second place, if these expenses were recoverable at all against the trustees, it is the company, and the company alone, who could recover them. I cannot see on what principle the appellant, a third party can have an action against the trustees on that contract of pledge if such contract there ever existed before the trustees'' possession. The appellant contracted with the company and the company alone. To the company alone he gave credit He sued the company and obtained judgment for these very same advances he now claims from the trustees. This fact it is true, is not by itself a bar to his present action, but is as full and complete evidence as can be had that his dealings were with the company. There is no lien de droit: there was no privity of contract between the appellant and the trustees, and I cannot see that any legal liability ever was created in his favour against the trustees by this contract of pledge, if it ever existed for the sum now claimed.\nThen this article 1973 C. C. upon which this argument is based, seems to me the very enactment that proves its unsoundness. This article says that the pledger is always responsible for the expenses incurred for the preservation of the thing pledged, even when the thing pledged is in the pledgee's possession. By what reasoning can it be contended that when, as here, by exception, the pledger retains possession, these expenses will then fall, not on the pledger, but on the pledgee ? I cannot see it. I take this article to lead to the very opposite conclusion, and, when applied to this case, to clearly throw on the u company alone all the expenses now claimed from the trustees.\nI have so far considered the deed of 1881, as creating till the 5th of October, 1883, a contract of pledge with the possession and title in the pledger.\nI have done so, howeyer, only argumentatively. I cannot see in the deed, as long as the company remained in possession, a contract of pledge. Possession by the pledgee is such an essential feature of that contract that there cannot, in my opinion, exist, any such thing as a contract of pledge with the pledge in the pledger's hands.\nNow if the deed of trust of 1881, as argued in the alternative by the appellant, is to be considered as an actual sale, one by which the title to this railway became vested immediately in the trustees with equity of redemption, even before default of payment of the interest on the mortgage bonds and before they exercised their right to take possession of it, is the appellant's action maintainable ? In that case the respondents are the vendees, allowing their vendor to remain in possession. The vendor in possession incurs expenses for the preservation of the thing sold, say, expenses absolutely necessary, and of which the vendees must eventually benefit. He incurs these expenses, and contracts for them in his own name with third parties. He himself may perhaps, then, under certain circumstances, have an action against his vendee for the re-imbursement of the monies so expended for his benefit though, as a general rule, till delivery, the property is at the vendor's risks and charges as a depositary but would F this give to those who have contracted with him the vendor, in his name, for these expenses, a right of action ( against the vendee personally, for the payment thereof? I should say, clearly not ; and, to apply this to the present case, supposing that the company might maintain an F action against the trustees for the expenses necessarily t; incurred on the road after the deed of 1881 and before the 5th October, 1883, yet I cannot see that this would give to the appellant, a third party, the right to claim from the trustees the advances he made to the company or in other words, the right to be paid by any one else than by the party he dealt with. Whether in such a case the appellant would have under art 1031 C. C., the right to exercise the company's action against the trustees is a question which does not arise. He claims to act here in his own name and to exercise his own personal right of action. And for the same reason I may as well immediately remark, the appellant's attempt to have his action considered as one de in rem verso ([21]), cannot help him. The action de in rem verso would, under the facts disclosed in the present case be an action by and in the name of the company against the trustees. The doctrine upon which such an action rests cannot be invoked by the appellant to create a lien de droit between him and the trustees\nTo follow Mr. Laflamme's able argument for the appellant, I have so far considered the deed of trust of 1881, before the respondents came into possession, either as creating a pledge or as an actual and complete sale of this railway, and I have said why, in my opinion, admitting it to be either one or the other the appellant has no action against the trustees. I need hardlv remark the contradiction between these two grounds of reasoning. If a pledge, the railway company remained the owners. If, a sale, the trustees became owners. Was that deed, however, anything else than a mortgagee or hypothec of of this railway, as long as the company remained in possession, within of course the sense and meaning that these words have in the Province of Quebec, where the hypothec is a kind of pledge in which the pledger retains both ownership and possession of the thing pledged in contradistinction to the contract of pledge, pignus, where the pledgee is put in possession, the title remaining in the pledger. It seems to me impossible to see in that deed, as interpreted in the light of the statute of 1880, anything else than a hypothecation of this railway in favour of the bondholders, not precisely the hypothecation of article 2016; 0. C, but with the exceptional right, given by the statute, of the mortgagee to enter into possession, in default of payment, after the exercise of which right the contract between the parties became one of nantissement, with of course, droit de r\u00e8tention, till paid, joined to the hypothec. The term \"sold\" is used in the deed, it is true. But the statute of 1880 authorizes only to convey as security. Transporter, says the French version. Then a deed called a sale may be nothing else but a contract of pledge : Ross v. Thompson ([22]) ; Farmer v. Bell ([23]) ; Canada Paper Company v. Cary ([24]).\nNow what is a hypothec, or rather its origin at common law ?\nTroplong ([25]) answers :\nL'on en vint donc par la suite \u00e0 \u00e8tablir qu'une simple convention suffirait pour que le d\u00e9biteur engage\u00e2t son fonds, sans en abandonner la possession \u00e0 condition toutefois de devoir en \u00eatre dessaisi, en cas de non paiement au temps fix\u00e9 par le contrat. Ce fut un \u00e9tablissement que le droit pr\u00e9torien emprunta \u00e0 la civilisation grecque. Aussile terme dont on se sert pour exprimer cette convention est-il purement grec.\nThis is, in my opinion, precisely the nature of the contract that has taken place between the parties here. The company were to remain in possession as long as they satisfied, as accrued, their liabilities to the bondholders. They might never have lost the possession, Ta and have continued to work the railway themselves, the railway, however, by the authority of this statute, all the time remaining vested in the bondholders or in the trustees for them till the complete satisfaction of their bonds, in 1901, as security therefor. I must confess that I can see nothing else in .this deed, before the trustees took possession, than a hypothecation of the railway, which hypothecation took the character of an antichresis, when the trustees took possession, or, to use the English law terms of their Lordships of the Privy Council, in the Redfield case ([26])\u2014a conveyance by a debtor to his creditor, coupled with possession, with right of redemption, in security of a debt ([27]). New as before remarked, it is for a debt contracted by the company, before default, and during the possession of the company, for the company, that the appellant now sues the trustees. That the mortgagee is Personallv liable for the debts created by the mortgagor in possession upon the property mortgaged could not be contended for. Yet the appellant goes that far, when he argues that the company, during the interval between the deed of trust of 1811 and the 5th October, 1883, were the agents or mandataries or negotiorum gestor of the trustees. A word now, as to the question of privilege, upon which the appellant at the hearing strenuously relied. Admitting, for the sake of argument, that he had a privilege on the railway for his claim, under arts. 1996 and 2009, C. C., as being for work done in the common interest of the creditors I cannot see how this can support his action. 1st There is no question here of preference or priority amongst creditors. 2nd. The privileged creditor has no personal action against the tiers d\u00e9tenteur of an immoveable affected by a privilege, but only a real action. 3rd. The privilege given for the expenses incurred in the common interest of the creditors cannot be exercised against a subsequent purchaser, or pledgee in possession, if it has not been registered.\nIt is true that art 2084 as does art. 2107 of the French Code, exempts such a privilege from the necessity of registration, but this must be read as applying merely to the respective rights of the creditors amongst themselves when a distribution of the price of sale of the property takes place. It has no application to subsequent purchasers or pledgees of the property, whose titles are registered. Art. 2056 ([28])\n4thly The trustees for the bondholders have by the act of 1880 confirmed in this respect by the act of 1881, 44-45 Vic. c. 43 the first lien and privilege on this rail-way with the droit de r\u00e9tention, till all arrears due on these bonds are paid. Consequently, the plaintiff, if he has this privilege attached to expenses made in the interest of the mass of the creditors, which, undoubtedly under art 1996 would include those incurred for the preservation of this railway, cannot have the benefit of his privilege, before disinteresting the bondholders. Being vested by the statute and the deed with the droit de retention, as a first lien and privilege the bondholders, and the trustees for them cannot be deprived F of it till they are entirely paid ([29]). This question does not directly arise in this case, however, as the appellant's action is merely a personal action against the F trustees. I have noticed it solely in answer to the appellant's contention as to the rank of his privilege under the code. It is clear, to my mind, that the statute of 1880 has given to the bondholders a privilege which carries priority to the appellant's claim, whatever rank his privilege would have had under the code, and, consequently, if the appellant was at all entitled to invoke his right of privilege in support of his action, he could not do so without having, as a condition precedent, paid all the bondholders ([30]). It has been argued for the appellant that the statute merely says that the conveyance shall be \" a first charge,\" and that this does not mean the first charge. But to my mind there is no ground whatever for that distinction. A first charge must mean second to none.\nSome of my remarks in the next case may apply to this one.\nI would dismiss the appeal\nONTARIO CAR COMPANY v. FARWELL.\nTASCHEREAU J. In this case the same trustees are sued by the Ontario Car Company, for cars sold on credit, to the South Eastern Railway Company, to the amount of over $45000 after the deed of trust of 1881 and before the 5th October 1883 that is to say as in the preceeding case, before the trustees were put into possession of the railway. Here also, as in the previous case, the Superior Court gave judgment for the plaintiffs, now appellants, and the Court of Appeal reversed that judgment. I need not repeat here my reasoning in the previous case, which applies almost entirely to this one. The two however are not precisely identical. Here, the Car Company's action prays as follows:\nThat the transfer and delivery of the said cars by the said company to the defendants and their predecessors be declared fraudulent, null and void and be set aside That the indenture of mortgage of the 12th. of August, 1881, the resolution of the shareholders authorizing the same, and the foreclosure and taking possession thereunder upon the 5th of October 1883, be also declared fraudulent null and without effect and be set aside so far as respect the said cars. That the said South Eastern Railway Company be impleaded to hear said transfer, indenture resolution and foreclosure set aside and hear the final judgment thereon. That the trustees, defendants, be adjudged and condemned to pay and satisfy the plaintiffs the sum of $45,556.97, damages for the use and detention of said cars from the 5th October 1883 to this date with interest.\nThat the defendants be ordered not to use and be enjoined and prevented from holding or using, said cars or any of them, as long as said plaintiffs shall not be p\u00e0id therefor the sum of $455556.97 with interest, and be condemned to surrender and deliver the said cars within fifteen days from the final judgment to be pronounced in the case in as good order and condition as when taken by the said trustees to a guardian to be named by said court, and that the same be sold in satisfaction of the plaintiffs' claim, and in default of so doing and failing to deliver the same that they be adjudged and condemned to pay jointly and severally the said sum of $45556.97.\nBy these conclusions, the car company do not ask for a direct personal condemnation against the trustees Neither do they claim the cars themselves, they merely claim a jus ad rem on them and that they be sold, en justice in satisfaction of their claim. It is only on the failure by the trustees to deliver up these cars so that they be so sold, that the car company ask, that they, the trustees, be condemned to pay the plaintiffs' claim. And I cannot see that it would have been possible in any case, upon these conclusions, to condemn the trustees to pay the amount claimed, without option, as the Superior Court has done.\nThis action, I notice, was instituted in December, 1886, over 3 years after the trustees entered into possession of the railway. The argument of counsel at bar had led me to understand that the car company based their action on a claim to a right of privilege, as unpaid F vendors. There is not a word of it, however in their declaration. The only grounds of their conclusions are that the deed of trust of 1881 and the delivery of possession in 1883, were fraudulent, null and void and strange to say, though the general issue was pleaded, only one witness was examined by the plaintiffs and that one, merely as to the necessity of these cars for the working of the railway. An admission covering certain facts is to be found in the record but there is nothing in it that can be connected in any way whatever, that I can see, with the plaintiffs' allegations of fraud. The insolvency of the railway company, in 1888, when they bought these cars, is admitted, but I fail to see that the trustees authorized by Act of Parliament to take possession of the railway, and everything connected with it, including these very cars, as security towards the bondholders, can be said to have participated in a fraud, when they did the very thing the statute was passed to authorize. If a fraud at all, all I can say is, that it was a fraud authorized by statute, and a statute enacted precisely because the railway company was insolvent. It is not even proved that when they entered into possession on the 5th October, 1883, the trustees were at all aware of the car company's claim against the railway company.\nUpon the general issue alone the plaintiffs' action it seems to me fails. But were it otherwise on that first plea, and taking it for granted that it may be gathered from the general allegations of their declaration that their claim is based on their privilege as unpaid vendors on the defendants' exception, by which they plead the privilege and mortgage given by the statute on this railway and all its rolling stock in favor of the mortgage bondholders, the result must be the same.\nIt is clear that by the deed of trust of 1881, as I said in the previous case, the railway and everything connected with it became a security towards the bond-holders with a first lien, privilege or mortgage on everything thereby conveyed, either moveable or immoveable comprising all cars, locomotives, tenders, etc., etc., then owned by the company, or that might from time to time thereafter be acquired by the company. Now the very cars upon which the plaintiffs claim a right became, by operation of the statute, at the very moment they came into the railway company's possession, and whether they are to be considered as moveable or immoveable property, affected and charged as security to the bondholders, with right of priority over all other creditors, including the privileged unpaid vendor. And even if it might be contended that this privilege and lien did not so attach immediately at the moment the railway company bought these cars and added them to their rolling stock, it seems to me unquestionable that, when on the 5th of October; 1883 the trustees got possession of them with the railway, as pledgees by antichresis, as additional security to their statutory mortgage, their droit de r\u00eatention became a first charge and lien, with priority over every other creditor, even the unpaid vendor, and that consequently the trustees cannot be dispossessed, except upon payment of all accrued interests on these bonds. Article 2001 C. C.\nTo give the plaintiffs a right of preference over the trustees or to deny to the trustees the droit de r\u00e9tention on these cars, would clearly be setting the statute at naught. Under article 1543 civil code, (article 5811 Revised statutes) the right of an unpaid vendor to demand the rescission of the sale of moveable things can only be exercised while the things sold remain in the possession of the buyer. The railway company here the buyers, not the trustees. The contention that they, the company, acted merely as agent or negotiorum gestor for the trustees is untenable. I have referred to this point in the previous case. The railway company was then the owner in possession with a statutory mortgage on the property in favor of the bondholders. When the statute gives to the trustees a lien or mortgage on the railway, it clearly implies that the trustees were not, at first, to be owners. One does not require a lien or mortgage on his own property for the payment of his claims. Then the statute and the deed provide when and under what circumstances the trustees might become later absolutely owners of the railway. This also implies that they were not yet owners, and still further there was no price of sale, so there was no sale ; pretium is a requisite of this contract as much as res et consensus. The fact that trustees for the bondholders benefited by the sale of these cars to the railway company does not help the plaintiffs. A hypothecary creditor always benefits from the improvements made and expenses incurred by his debtor on the property hypothecated.\nAs to the unpaid vendor's right of revendication, under article 1998, civil code, it clearly cannot be claimed by the plaintiffs. 1st, because they had given delay to the railway company for the payment of these cars. 2nd because those cars are now in the hands of a third party. 3rd because they are too late. Articles 1998 1999 civil code and cases cited in de Bellefeuille's code under these articles; Rhode Island v South Eastern ([31]). I need not dwell on this any longer however as the action here is not one of revendication.\nBut further are these cars now moveable property y It is a well established jurisprudence that the rolling u stock of a railway is immoveable property and part of the freehold. The appellants argue, however, that the immobilisation of a moveable does not operate against its unpaid vendor. Admitting this to be so, and the weight of authorities now seems to incline that way, the rule applies only between the vendor and the vendee as long as the vendee is in possession of the thing sold, but does not operate against a third party who comes into possession of an immoveable to which are attached moveable things which by law are immoveable par destination, nor against a mortgaged creditor I think that the point is now not Open to discussion. I refer to the cases of Chr\u00e9tien ([32]) and Camus ([33]) in that sense. So that, putting aside the general rule that \" les meubles n'ont pas de suite ([34]), \" on this other consideration I do not see how the action can be supported. The immobilisation takes effect against an unpaid vendor in favor of the mortgaged creditor, even if the buyer is still in possession. Marcad\u00e9 ([35]), says :\u2014\nLa seconde question est de savoir si la resolution de la v\u00e9nte mobili\u00e9re qui est impossible quand le meuble vendu est pas\u00e9\u00e9 dans les mains d'un tiers de bonne foi qui l'a achet\u00e9 ou re\u00e7u en gage est \u00e9galement impossible quand cc meuble est devenu immeuble par destination et qu'il se trouve soumis au droit d'un cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire de l'acheteur Mr. Troplong (addit. au No. 465) et plusieurs arr\u00eats d\u00e9cident que la r\u00e9solution peut encore avoir lieu L'acheteur disent-ils en substance n'a pas pu transf\u00e9rer plus de droits qu'il n'en avait lui-m\u00eame ; or la transformation du meuble en immeuble par destination ne met pas cet acheteur \u00e0 l'abri de l'action du vendeur la preuve en est dans l'article 593, puisque la loi, apr\u00e8s avoir prohib\u00e9 en principe, dans l'article 592 la saisie ex\u00e9cution des meubles immobilis\u00e9s par destination, la permet dans cet article 593, au vendeur non pay\u00e9. Cette dectrine nous parait inexacte, et nous pensons, avec Mr. Duvergier (1439) et des arr\u00eats post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 ceux indiqu\u00e9s ci-dessus, que l'action r\u00e9solutoire n\u2019est pas admissible ici\nIl est tr\u00e8s vrai Que du vendeur \u00e0 l'acheteur l'immobilisation dont il s'agit ne nuit en rien au droit de ce vendeur, mais il en est autrement entre le vendeur et le tiers qui acquiert un droit sur le meuble vendu, et il est faux de dire que le tiers ne puisse pas avoir plus de droits que n'en aurait l'acheteur Mr Troplong reconnait que vu l'effet de la possession de bonne foi sur les choses mobili\u00e8res, celui \u00e0 qui le meuble aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 revendu par mon acheteur serait \u00e0 l'abri de mon action en resolution, tandis que mon acheteur, lui, s'il avait encore le meuble, ne pourrait pas s'en garantir.\nLe tiers peut donc avoir plus de droits que l'acheteur, et c'est tout simple, puisque c'est un effet de la bonite foi de ce tiers, bonne foi dont l'acheteur qui ne paye pas ne saurait argumenter. Si celui \u00e0 qui le meuble a \u00e9t\u00e9 revendu est \u00e0 l'abri de l'action r\u00e9solutoire s'il en est de m\u00eame du cr\u00e9ancier dont ce meuble est devenu le gage mobilier pourquoi en serait-il autrement de celui dont il est devenu, par son immobilisation, le gage hypoth\u00e9caire ?\nLe droit de ce dernier n'est pas moins favorable et c'est avec raison que la jurisprudence se fixe dans ce sens !\nSee in the same sense, Pont ([36]) ; Aubry & Rau ([37]) also say :\nIl importe peu, quant aux immeubles par destination, que les objets r\u00e9put\u00e9s tels aient d\u00e9j\u00e0 exist\u00e9 en cet \u00e9tat au moment de l'\u00e9tablissement de l'hypoth\u00e8que, ou que le propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 ne les y ait attach\u00e9s que plus tard. On doit en conclure que le vendeur d'objets mobiliers, par exemple de machines incorpor\u00e9es par l'acheteur \u00e0 l'immeuble hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9, ne peut exercer ni l'action r\u00e9solutoire ni le privil\u00e9ge \u00e9tabli, par le No. 4 de l'art. 2102 an detriment des cr\u00e9ancisrs hypoth\u00e9caires de ce dernier, qu'ils soient ant\u00e9rieurs on post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la vente.\nSee also Zachariae ([38]) and Dalloz ([39]). According to these authors, these cars are now immoveable property, as forming part of the railway, and. the trustees' mortgage and privilege on the railway extends to them even if they the trustees, were not vested with the possession.\nA case of Detouche c. Neustadt ([40]), in the Cour de Cassation is in point.\nSee also Philion v. Bisson ([41]) and article 2017, civil code\nBut if they are moveables, the plaintiffs are not in a better position.\nLe droit de r\u00e9solution et le privil\u00e8ge supposent que l'acheteur est encore en possession de la chose ([42]).\nThe Colebrook Rolling, Mills v. Oliver ([43]), Thibaudeau v. Mills ([44]).\nSee also Laurent ([45]); B\u00e9darride Achats et Ventes ([46]).\nArticle 1996, civil code, relating to disbursements incurred for the preservation of the property has been cited by the appellants, but it hardly applies to the facts of this case. But should it apply the statute here again intervenes, and sets at rest all possible controversy as to the relative rank of the claim for these expenses, or that of the unpaid vendor's and that of the trustees, by enacting that the trustees shall be first.\nAnother point upon which there can be no doubt, is that when the vendor has given credit the pledgee's claim has priority over the vendor's ([47]).\nAnd again :\u2014\nLa r\u00e9solution de la vente mobili\u00e8re la poursuite du vendeur non pav\u00e9 ne peut avoir lieu contre un tiers \u00e0 qui le meuble a pass\u00e9 de bonne foi en gage ([48]).\nArticle 417 civil code, which enacts that the proprietor must re-imburse to the possessor the necessary expenses incurred on the property, was also invoked by the plaintiffs and is referred to by the Superior Court, but it has no application. The expenses here were made F by the railway company as owners in full possession and for themselves. The plaintiffs sold these cars to the railway company, and, on that sale, they have no personal action against the trustees. This article, if it applied at all, would give an action to the railway F company against the trustees, but cannot give one to the car company.\nArticles 1043 and 1046 civil code were also relied upon by the Superior Court. This last article enacts that he whose business has been well managed by a negotiorum gestor is bound, 1st, to fulfil the obligations that the negotiorum gestor has contracted in his (the person whose business has been well managed) name, 2nd., to indemnify him for all the personal liabilities which he has assumed and 3nd., to reimburse him all necessary or useful expenses. In the Wallbridge case, the Superior Court treated the railway company pending their possession after the deed of trust, as the negotiorum gestor of and acting for the trustees. This, in that case, under article 1046, would have given an action to the railway company against the trustees, but not to the plaintiff. The railway company did not contract with the plaintiff Wallbridge in the trustees' name, and it is not pretended that they did. Then the railway company were not negotiorum gestor at all for Wallbridge, as I said in that case. In the present case, the Superior Court, another judge presiding, held that it is the Ontario Car Company that was the negotiorum gestor for the trustees. I cannot adopt that view of the facts. I cannot see how the Ontario Car Company, by the simple fact of selling cars to the railway company acting for itself became the negotiorun gestor of the trustees. By this line of reasoning the bondholders, instead of a security on this railway, would have been liable to all the expenses even before getting the control and revenue.\nAs to the plea of res judicata. It appears on this record that, in previous actions, the present plaintiffs attempted seizure en revendication of these very same cars, and that by judgments, which are now chose jug\u00e9e, these seizures were quashed on the ground that these cars were now immoveable property, as forming part of the rolling stock of this railway.\nLe vendeur qui a succomb\u00e9 sur la demande en revendication d'objets mobiliers, est-il ensuite recevable \u00e0 former une demande en r\u00e9solution de la vente des m\u00eames objets ? Non, suivant la Cour de Cassation, ([49]).\nThe annotator however brings strong arguments against that decision, and I do not determine this question of res judicata I would hesitate, however to say that it is not res judicata between the parties that these cars now form part of the freehold. The seizures were quashed on that only ground.\nL'autorit\u00e9 de. la chose jug\u00e9e s'attache aux motifs d'un jugement quand ils out \u00e9t\u00e9 sanctionn\u00e9s par le dispositif ([50]).\nIt might perhaps have been contended that the plaintiff'' action was nothing else but the action Pauliana, to set aside the deed of August, 1881, as made in fraud of creditors. Articles 1039 and 1040 however would have been in their way, apart from the statute of 1880. passed for the very purpose of authorizing that deed. That is probably why they have not attempted to support their action, as one of that character.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nSince I wrote down these reasons for my conclusion it has been suggested by my colleagues that, as the deed puts upon the trustees the obligation to pay the running expenses of the road, they are liable for the appellants' claim. But I cannot adopt this conclusion.\nI. I read the deed as stipulating that the trustees, after they come into possession, shall be bound to pay the expenses of the road incurred during their possession, but cannot see that they covenanted to pay the expenses incurred or expended by the company itself during the possession by the company.\nSuch a construction of the deed would put on the trustees all the debts incurred by the company, even those incurred prior to the deed of trust.\nIf this was the true construction the statute of 1881 would have been altogether unnecessary, and I take that statute as a legislative interpretation that the bondholders' lien has priority over all other creditors whatever.\nBy this construction, the enactment which gives to the mortgage bond holders a first lien on the road and all its appurtenances is set at nought.\nThis construction has not been thought of, even by the appellants and is inconsistent with their declaration and particularly with their conclusions, as were it to prevail, it would necessarily entail a direct condemnation against the trustees for the amount claimed, with execution, of course, against the railway itself and all its appurtenances, a condemnation which in this case would clearly be ultra petita.\nEven if that was the true construction of the deed, the appellants' action should fail for want of privity of contract : as it is clear that a covenant between the company and the trustees that the trustees should pay the expenses incurred by the company would not give. to the appellants a right of action against the trustees. GWYNNE J.\u2014The decision in these cases must depend upon the construction to be put upon the terms and provisions of the trust indenture by way of mortgage, executed by the South Eastern Railway Company, under the authority of the Quebec Statutes, 43 and 44 Vic., ch. 49, and 44 and 45 Vic., ch. 43. y By the former of these acts the company was author ized to issue certain bonds and, for the purpose of securing the payment of the same and interest thereon, to convey the railway, franchise and all property, rights and interests owned, possessed or enjoyed by it, and the tolls, income, profits, improvements and renewals thereof and additions thereto, to trustees in trust for that purpose and it was enacted that the trustees to whom such conveyance should be made should be designated by the shareholders at a meeting of the shareholders authorizing the issue of said bonds, and that the said conveyance should be made in such form as the shareholders at such meeting should direct, and that the company and the said trustees might therein, among other things, stipulate as to who should have possession, management and control of the said franchise and other property therein conveyed, and receive the tolls and income thereof and how the same should be applied and disposed of, while such bonds should be outstanding, as well before as after default should be made in the payment thereof, or of any of the coupons thereto attached and might make such other provisions therein, not contrary to law, as might be considered necessary or convenient for the purposes of such trust '. and the trustees were by the act authorized upon default being made in payment of the said bonds or coupons, to take possession of and run, operate, maintain, manage and control the said railway and other property conveyed to them as fully and effectually as the company might do the same; and it was further enacted that the said conveyance should be to all intents valid and should create a first lien privilege and mortgage upon the said railway and other property thereby conveyed : and it was expressly declared that neither the said company, who were the proprietors of the road at the time of the passing of the said act nor those contemplated to become proprietors under the act, namely the trustees, and, eventually, the bondholders, should have power F to close or cease running any part of the said road. Under the authority of these acts the trust indenture therein referred to was executed by the company to certain trustees therein named whereby after recital of the issue of the bonds authorised by the act the company granted, bargained and sold to the trustees, the railway of the company as the same was then located and constructed, and as the same might thereafter be located and constructed and all branches thereafter to be built and all the lands &c,, &c., then owned or that thereafter might be acquired by the company for the uses of the railway, together with the franchises of the company and all rights secured to the company by its charter, and also all cars, locomotives tenders, wood, ties, steel and iron rails, tools, machinery, supplies, and personal property of every description then owned by the company, or that might from time to time thereafter be acquired by the company for the purpose of operating and maintaining the said railway and transacting the business thereof, and also all the right title and interest of the company in two certain railways, called the Newport and Richford railways and the Lake Champlain and St. Lawrence Junction railway to have and to hold to the trustees upon the trusts thereinafter specified and, among such trusts upon trust, that until default should be made in the payment of the said bonds or of some portion of the interest thereon, and such default should continue for the space of 90 days the company should be entitled to retain possession of all . of the railway property, rights and interests thereby conveyed and to run, operate and manage the same, and to take and receive all and. singular the tolls : receipts income and profits of the same and the business thereof for their own use, benefit and advantage, in all respects as fully and absolutely as if the indenture had not been made; but that upon such default happening then the trustees should be entitled, and have the right, to take and receive immediate possession of the said railway, and all the property, rights, and interests by the said indenture conveyed and to run, operate, and manage the same, and to take and receive all and singular the tolls receipts income and profits of the same and the business thereof, as fully and absolutely as the company might otherwise do, and use, pay out, and disburse said tolls, receipts, income and profits in the payment and settlement of all expenses of running, operating, managing, and maintaining the said railway and other property, rights and interests thereby conveyed, including all rents due for the use of any and all railways and property leased to the company, as specified in the leases thereof, or agreements in respect thereto, and all expenses and liabilities incurred by the trustees their successors and assigns in that behalf and a reasonable compensation to them for their services:! and also all expenses of renewing, repairing, and increasing the said railway and other property for the purpose of keeping the same in good condition for the transaction of the business thereof; and all taxes and assessments on said property thereby conveyed, and all legal claims thereon arising from the operating of said railway, including damages caused by accidents, and all other charges, and the balance of said tolls, receipts, income and profits, after paying or providing for the payment of all and singular the expenses and payments afore-said, to use, pay out and disburse semi-annually to the owners and holders of the bonds aforesaid, and the residue, after paying all such bonds to the company.\nNow in the month of November, 1883, the plaintiff, Wallbridge recovered a judgment in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec against the South Eastern Railway Company for the sum of $7970.00 and G interest for lumber and ties supplied to the company, for the necessary use and working of the railway, between the months of August, 1881, and September, 1883, and the plaintiffs, the Ontario Car and Foundry Company, in the month of July, 1884, recovered three several judgments against the railway company for the sum in the whole of $45,566.97, exclusive of interest for,\u20141. 200 railway platform cars delivered to the railway company in the month of February, 1883, for the necessary use and working of the railway. 2. for 50 coal cars delivered to the company in the month of May, 1883, for the like necessary use and working of the railway, and,\u20143. for 20 cattle cars delivered to the company in the month of July, 1883, for the like necessary use and working of the railway. On the 5th October, 1883, the trustees under the said trust indenture took possession of the railway and of all the above material and plant so as aforesaid supplied for the necessary use of the railway ; and made use thereof under the provisions of the said act 43 and 44 Vict. ch. 49, and of the said trust indenture in operating and working the said railway which, by the act, they were under the obligation to continue to run and operate, and the question is whether, for the purpose of obtaining satisfaction of the said judgments which still remain wholly unsatisfied, the parties who supplied the materials and plant above described, and which was all necessary for the working of the railway, have any remedy against the trustees personally, or against the receipts, income, and profits coming to their hands from the working of the railway and the use of the said material and plant.\nThat the bondholders in whose interest and for whose benefit the trustees are operating, as they are by he act obliged to keep the railway in operation, have obtained the benefit of the plant and material in question there can be no doubt ; and as deriving the benefit, it is not unreasonable that some provision for such a case should have been made in the trust indenture ; it would certainly, I think, be but just and equitable that there should be, and the only question appears to me to be whether there has been. If the material and plant had not been provided by the company, the trustees, I apprehend there can be no doubt would have taken possession much sooner than they did, and, upon taking possession, in order to operate the railway as they were obliged by the statute to do in the interest of the bondholders must needs have supplied themselves with the material and plant; and, in that case they must have been personally responsible, to whomsoever should supply it, for the price thereof: but the material and plant in question having been delivered to the railway company before the trustees took possession, although the latter, as trustees of the bondholders, derive all the benefit and could not continue to operate the railway without such material and plant they, cannot, I agree in thinking, be made personally responsible. It was argued, that the true construction of the trust indenture is that the company's possession of the railway, after the execution of the indenture prior to the railway being taken possession of by the trustees, was as agents merely of the trustees, in whom the property was vested by the trust indenture and that therefore the trustees should be held to be liable for material and plant, necessary to keep the railway in operation, provided for the benefit FA of the trustees by their duly authorised agents ; but this contention cannot be entertained in face of the express provision in the trust indenture that until F default the company should be at liberty to retain their possession of the railway, &c, &c., &c., for their own use, benefit, and advantage, as fully and absolutely as if the indenture had never been made The statute however enacts that it is whatever the c conveyance,\" that is, the trust indenture, provides for, that shall become a first lien privilege and mortgage upon the railway and other property thereby conveyed. Now, the trust indenture in express terms provides for many things as being payable out of the income and receipts from the railway before anything shall be paid to the bondholders\nThe trustees, on behalf of the bondholders are by the statute bound to keep the railway in operation, consequently all claims and expenses incurred by the trustees in their operating the railway became a first charge upon the income and receipts coming to their hands, as a necessary incident upon the obligation imposed upon them to keep the railway in operation, without any express declaration in relation to such claims and expenses. However, the trust indenture apparently, cx majori cautel\u00e2, does declare the trust purposes towards which the trustees shall apply the income and receipts coming to their hands, namely :\u2014\n1st. in payment of all expenses of running, operating, managing and maintaining the railway and other property vested in them by the trust indenture including all rents due for the use of any railway leased to the company. 2nd. In paying reasonable compensation to themselves for their services\n3rd. In payment of all expenses of renewing, repairing and increasing the railway and other property for the purpose of keeping the same in good condition for the transaction of business.\nNow these trust purposes so declared seem to cover and include everything having relation to expenses and claims arising from the operating of the railway by the trustees. But the trust indenture provides further, that the trustees, out of the income coming to their hands from the railway, shall pay :\n4th. \" All taxes and assessments, and all legal claims on the property thereby conveyed, arising from the operating of the railway, including damages caused by accidents and all other charges.\"\nAll charges and claims of the nature comprised under this last head which should arise or accrue during the period that the trustees should be operating the railway, had already been provided for in express terms ; the question, therefore, appears to me to be resolved simply into this ; is this provision to be construed also as wholly and solely relating to claims and charges arising while the railway is being operated by the trustees? To my mind, there appears to be a difficulty in so construing it, for, as already observed, the previous provisions in express terms provided for the application of the income by the trustees towards the payment of every one of the items enumerated under this 4th head, if they occurred while the railway was in the possession of and operated by the trustees ; the implication, therefore, would seem to be that what is here provided for cannot be limited, at least, to matters occurring wholly during the period that the railway is so operated. Sufficient provision had already been made for the payment of all taxes accrued during the possession of the railway by the trustees, as expenses necessarily incident to their running, operating, managing and maintaining the railway and other property in good working order and condition. Now, assuming taxes to have accrued due and payable before the trustees took possession, which still remained unpaid after they had taken possession, they surely would be F justified under this provision of the trust indenture in paying out of the income coming to their hands all taxes which were over due before they took possession. Taxes, it may be said, stand on a peculiar footing\u2014 granted\u2014but in this sentence in which this provision as to taxes is made the other charges mentioned are connected by the copulative \" and all legal claims,\" &c., &c., &c. Is there., then any reason why the trustees should not in like manner under the language of this provision, be justified in paying and if justified, liable to be compelled to pay, out of the income coming to their hands \" all legal claims arising from the operating of the railway, including damages caused by accidents and all other charges, \" which had occurred in connection with the operating of the railway prior to their taking possession and which then still remained unpaid? As, for example, supposing that while the railway was worked by the company the wages and stipend of those engaged in working it had not been paid in full but that a portion had been suffered to fall into arrear would not the trustees upon their taking possession and finding such wages and stipend to be in arrear, be justified under this provision in the deed, in paying such arrears by degrees out of the income and receipts coming to their hands? Again, supposing that an accident had occurred on the railway a day, a week or a month or more before the trustees took possession which accident had caused damages to individuals the amount of which had not yet been ascertained, or that it had been ascertained but not yet paid, when the trustees took possession, would not the trustees be justified, under this provision in the trust indenture, in applying, and if justified, could they not be compelled to apply, some portion of the monies coming to their hands towards payment of such damages ? And if they would be so justified and could be compelled so to do why should they not be equally justified in paying, and be equally F liable to be compelled to pay all other charges which, like those in the present case are for the direct improvement and beneficial increase in the value of the property vested in the trustees, and absolutely necessary for the operating of the railway by them on their taking possession, although such charges accrued due and payable three months or more or it might he only a week or a day before the trustees should take possession ?\nThe peculiar language of the trust indenture in defining the trust purposes to which the trustees are authorized and directed to apply the income and receipts coming to their hands, present a great difficulty, as it appears to me, in limiting the authority and direction to matters accruing wholly while the railway is in the possession of the trustees, and being worked by them, but if the plaintiffs be entitled to relief in virtue of the provision of the trust indenture, under consideration, it would be by an equitable decree framed with due regard to the other necessary appropriations of the in-come, in accordance with the provisions of the trust indenture a decree which could not be made in the present actions which are not framed for that purpose, but are framed solely for the purpose of obtaining judgment against the trustees personally, which, as I have already said, I-concur in thinking that the facts and law do not warrant. I must concur, therefore, in dismissing' the appeals.\nPATTERSON J.\u2011I concur in dismissing these appeals on the grounds stated by my brother Taschereau. I also agree with the views expressed by my brother Gwynne whose opinion I have read, so far as they affect the present actions in which the trustees personally are charged.\nI am not prepared to express an opinion as to the trustees being justified, and being compellable in any other form of action to provide for claims such as those of these plaintiffs. By the terms of the mortgage deed, they are to hand over from time to time to the company all surplus income not required for the payment of the overdue bonds and coupons. Such surplus moneys, if any such should be forthcoming, would form a fund to which these plaintiffs could have recourse. But to construe the trusts as including among the specified charges debts incurred before the trustees took possession of the road, thus giving those debts priority over the bonds and coupons would seem to be in effect abandoning the limit of $12,000 a mile or $2,000,000 in all, affixed by the statute to the borrowing powers accorded to the company, and so far impairing the security offered to purchasers of the bonds.\nI should, therefore, require to consider maturely the suggestion that the income in the hands of the trustees was chargeable with debts of this class in any form of action, before venturing an opinion upon it.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Laflamme, Madore & Cross.\nSolicitor for respondent: Jas.

Ritchie C.J. and Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nBill of sale\u2014Registry\u2014Defective affidavit\u2014Assignment for benefit of creditors\u2014Writ of execution\u2014Signature of prothonotary\u2014Seal of court.\nAn assignment of personal property in trust to sell the same and apply the proceeds to the payment of debts due certain named creditors of the assignor is a bill of sale within sec. 4 of the Nova Scotia Bills of Sale Act (R.S.N.S. 5th ser. c. 92) not being an assignment for the general benefit of creditors and so excepted from the operation of the act by see. 10.\nThe omission of the date and the words \"before me\" from the jurat of an affidavit accompanying a bill of sale under s. 4 of the said act makes such affidavit void and the defect cannot be supplied by parol evidence in proceedings by a creditor of the assignor against the mortgaged goods. Gwynne J. dissenting.\nPer Gwynne J. Sec. 4 of the act only applies to bills of sale by way of chattel mortgage and not to an assignment absolute in its terms and upon trust to sell the property assigned.\nIn the Province of Nova Scotia writs of execution need not be signed by the prothonotary of the court. It is the seal of the court which gives validity to such writs, not the signature of the officer.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment in favor of the plaintiff at the trial.\nThe defendant is sheriff of the County of Halifax, N. S., and the action is brought for the possession of goods seized under an execution which the plaintiff claims under a deed of assignment to him from one Eaton, against whom the execution was issued, for the benefit of creditors. The points raised and argued in the case were the following: 1. That the execution under which the sheriff justified was improperly issued, not being signed by the prothonotary of the court.\n2. That the affidavit attached to the assignment and required by the Bills of Sale Act was defective, the jurat containing no date and the words \"before me\" being omitted, in consequence of which the deed could not be registered and would not operate as against subsequent creditors.\n3. That the assignment itself was void for containing preferences to creditors and a resulting trust in favor of the debtor.\nR.S.N.S. 5th ser. ch. 942 contains the following provisions:\u2014\nSec. 1. Every bill of sale of personal chattels, made either absolutely or conditionally, or subject or not subject to any trust * * * shall be filed with the registrar, etc.\nSec. 4. Every bill of sale or chattel mortgage of personal property, other than mortgages to secure future advances, * * * shall hereafter be accompanied by an affidavit of the party giving the same, or his agent or attorney duly authorized in that behalf, that the amount set forth therein as being the consideration thereof is justly and honestly due and owing by the grantor * * * * *; otherwise such bill of sale or chattel mortgage shall be null and void as against the creditors of the grantor or mortgagor.\nSec. 10. In constructing this chapter the following words and expressions shall have the meanings hereby assigned to them, unless there be something in the subject or context repugnant to such construction, that is to say:\nThe expression \"bills of sale\" shall include bills of sale, assignments, transfers, and other assurances of personal chattels, and also powers of attorney, authorities or licenses to take possession of personal chattels as security for any debt, but shall not include the following documents, that is to say, assignments for the general benefit of the creditors of the person making or giving the same * * *.\nThe assignment in this case, made by Chas. L. Eaton to the respondent Hubley, contained the following declaration of trust after the usual words of conveyance which included all the household goods and furniture and all other personal estate and effects of the assignor:\u2014\n\"To have and to hold the said land and premises and the said personal estate upon trust to sell and dispose of the same at such time and manner as to him shall seem best and collect in the money therefor, upon trust to pay the costs and expenses incurred by him on respect of these presents, and ten per centum of the gross proceeds to the said party of the second part in payment for his labor and responsibility herein, and the residue of said trust moneys in the payment of the following amounts to the persons, creditors of said Charles L. Eaton, named herein without any preference of payment, namely; The said Andrew Hubley, $100, Benjamin Hubley $400, Thomas Ritchie (interest $45, city taxes and water rates now $38), Gordon and Keith $12, Doctor Cowie $60, John McLearn $8.35, R. N. McDonald $12.16, Williams and Manual $14.40, Hessian and Devine, $4.10, and the balance, if any, to the said Charles L. Eaton.\"\nThe assignor, Eaton, made an affidavit as required by the above section 4 of the act the jurat to which was as follows:\n\"Sworn to, at Halifax, in the County of , Halifax this day of September, 1887.\nJ. Parsons. A Commissioner of the Supreme Court, County of Halifax.\"\nThe assignment with this affidavit attached was filed as a bill of sale under the above act.\nOne James Jack having recovered judgment for a debt due to him by the said Eaton issued execution and caused the goods covered by the assignment to be seized thereunder. The present action was then brought against the sheriff.\nThe court below held that the assignment was not one for the general benefit of creditors and therefore came within the act, and that whether or not the affidavit was void for the defect in the jurat the plaintiff was entitled to recover as the execution issued by the defendant was void for want of the signature of the prothonotary.\nThe defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nRoss for the appellant. Under the practice established by the Judicature Act, in 1884 the signature of the prothonotary is not required to writs. See R. S. N. S. 5 Ser. Order 40 and rules p. 903. Rule 14 gives the form of execution which was followed in the present case.\nIf the writ should have been signed the omission of the signature is an irregularity only and does not make it void.\nThe jurat to the affidavit annexed to the deed of assignment is defective in two respects. The words \"before me\" are omitted, which has been held fatal in many cases. The Queen v. Bloxham[1]; Graham v. Ingleby[2]. And the day of the month was left blank, which has also been held bad. In re Lloyd[3]; Duke of Brunswick v. Harmer[4]. The deed is void under the statute of Elizabeth. In the ease of The Union Bank of Halifax v. Whitman[5] an assignment for benefit of creditors was set aside as creating preferences to which unpreferred creditors could not be asked to assent. The present deed is open to the same objections as were made to the deed in that case.\nEaton Q. C. for the respondent. The question as to the form of the execution is one of practice in the court below with which an appellate court will not interfere.\nThe Judicature Act did not expressly alter the practice which had been followed for many years previously, and will not be held to alter it by implication.\nThat the writ is void, and not merely irregular, is supported by Hooper v. Lane[6].\nAs to the objection to the affidavit it is submitted that a different rule prevails in respect to affidavits required by statute and those used in judicial proceedings. See Ex parte Johnson[7]; Cheney v. Courtois[8]; Moyer v. Davidson[9].\nPerjury could be assigned before jurats were used. Cheney v. Courtois (4); Hollingsworth v. White[10].\nNo question can arise as to the registration of the deed as plaintiff was in possession.\nA deed is not void merely for containing preferences. Whitman v. Union Bank of Halifax (1) does not so decide, and the deed in that case was of a peculiar character. Nor is a resulting trust fatal. If there had been nothing else in Whitman v. Union Bank (1) but a a resulting trust the deed would not have been set aside.\nRoss, in reply, cited Ex parte Parsons[11], and Newlove v. Shrewsbury[12], on the question of possession avoiding the necessity of registry.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014The first question that arises in this case is: Was this deed of assignment an instrument which required to have an affidavit attached? If it was, was the affidavit so attached a compliance with the statute, or if it was not were the executions under which the sheriff levied, valid executions?\nAs to the first question, the court below appears to have considered that the instrument not being for the general benefit of creditors, the statute required that to be valid against an execution creditor the provisions of ch. 92 R.S.N.S. 5th ser. must be complied with, and that therefore there should have been an affidavit; in this I quite agree with the court below.\nSecondly: Was the affidavit in this case a compliance with the statute? I think it was not; it was without date and the words \"before me\" were omitted. I have no hesitation in saying that the omission of the date and the words \"before me\" are fatal, and I quite agree with Mr. Justice Ritchie that\nWhen the legislature required an affidavit to be filed with the bill of sale they meant a document that had all the requisites of an affidavit according to the common law and the well recognized practice of the Superior Courts.\nThese omissions are not mere matters of form. In addition to the cases cited in the court below I may mention as to the want of a date Re Lloyd[13], and The Duke of Brunswick v. Slowman[14], and as to the absence of the words \"before me\" as Lord Denman remarked in The Queen v. Bloxham[15]:\nThe objection is not ambiguity but insufficiency.\nAnd again: I think this is not an irregularity which can be waived; a defect of jurisdiction is shown and the objection is one which we cannot avoid giving effect to.\nAnd in the same case Coleridge J. says:\nThe objection is not a mere irregularity but affects the jurisdiction.\nBut I do not think it necessary to refer to the effect of such omission in affidavits at common law, or those used in judicial proceedings based on the practice or rules of the court. We have a statutory enactment by which we must be governed; the statute ch. 92 R.S.N. S. 5th ser. expressly provides by the 11th sec. that the affidavits mentioned in secs. 4 and 5 shall be as nearly as may be in the form in schedules A and B respectively, and the following is the form of jurat in said schedules:\nSworn to at , in the county of this day of , A.D. 18 , (Sgd.) A.B. Before me,\nHow can it be said that this affidavit is as nearly as may be in the forms of schedules A and B. respectively? Certainly the date and the words \"before me\" are material ingredients in affidavits. If these can be omitted why may not the place where sworn be likewise dispensed with, and so the whole jurat be got rid of? I cannot think the words \"as nearly as may be\" were intended to permit material and substantial omissions and departures from the forms given, but rather referred to the material facts set forth in the body of the affidavit, which, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, cannot be, or are not, in the exact words of the affidavit given, but are, as nearly as may be, substantially the same. The jurat, unless strictly as provided for, cannot be \"as nearly as may be,\" for the substantial requisites of the jurat are entirely omitted. How can this affidavit be said to be a substantial. equivalent to the form when it cannot be said to have the same legal effect? The cases of Parsons v. Brand and Colson v. Dickson[16], on the English Bills of Sale Act, show how rigidly the Court of Appeal held parties to a strict adherence to the provisions of the statute and to a compliance with the forms prescribed. In those cases Lord Justice Cotton said:\nThere was nothing in the act itself requiring that the names, addresses and descriptions of the attesting witnesses should be added. The question was, whether either of these bills of sale complied with the requirement of sec. 9\u2014that they should be made in accordance with the form in the schedule to the act.\nAnd the court held that the bills of sale did not comply with what that section required, but were void for want of the addresses and description of the attesting witnesses as required by the form in the schedule. And see Bird v. Davey[17].\nAnd I am quite clear that this deficiency cannot be supplied by parol evidence. If this could be done, and the date established, and the person before whom sworn and his authority to take affidavits can be shown by parol testimony, why may not the whole jurat be dispensed with and even the signature of the attesting party himself?\nI cannot, however, agree with the court below that the execution under which the sheriff justifies is void because, though sealed with the seal of the court, it is not signed by the prothonotary. It appears to me to be utterly useless to go back a hundred years to ascertain what the practice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia then was; though this may be a very interesting antiquarian study for those who have the time to pursue it I fail to see that it has any practical bearing on the case we are now considering, because the whole matter of the practice of suing out writs has been in modern times the subject of special legislation. By the first series R.S.N.S. (1857) ch. 133, it was provided\u2014\nThat all writs should be signed by the prothonotary with his name and the date of their issue and be subscribed with the name of the attorney or party by whom they are sued forth, and shall be directed to the proper officer and be in the form theretofore used.\nWhen the statutes were again revised in 1859, the second series, this section was omitted; so also in the third and fourth series this provision was likewise omitted, clearly showing, to my mind, that the legislature did not deem the signing of the prothonotary necessary; in the fifth series, 1884, there is the strongest possible confirmation of this view, with reference to writs of summons:\nEvery writ of summons shall be issued out of the office of one of the prothonotaries. Every writ of summons shall be sealed by the officer issuing the same and shall thereupon be deemed to be issued.\nThen we have the provisions with reference to executions as follows:\u2014\n20. A writ of execution, if un executed, shall remain in force for one year only from its issue, unless renewed in the manner hereinafter provided, but such writ may at any time before its expiration, by leave of the court or a judge, be renewed by the party issuing it for one year from the date of such renewal, and so on from time to time during the continuance of the renewed writs, either by being marked with a seal of the court, and having indicated the date of the day, month and year of such renewal, or by such party giving a written notice of renewal to the sheriff, signed by the party or his solicitor, and bearing the like seal of the court and date; and a writ of execution so renewed shall have effect, and be entitled to priority, according to the time of the original delivery thereof.\nThe production of a writ of execution, or of the notice renewing the same, purporting to be sealed and marked as in the last preceding rule mentioned, showing the same to have been renewed, shall be suffirent evidence of its having been so renewed.\nAll this showing, to my mind, beyond all doubt, that the proper authentication of the execution was the seal of the court, not the signature of the prothonotary; and I think it cannot be doubted that the seal of the court is the proper authentication of all acts of the court and not the signing of the prothonotary. This is evidenced by order 59, sec. 2, applicable to copies and other documents, which declares that\nAll copies, certificates and other documents appearing to be sealed with a seal of the court, used by the prothonotary, shall be assumed to be authenticated copies or certificates or other documents issued by the prothonotary, and may be received in evidence, and no signature or other formality except the sealing with the prothonotary's seal shall be required for the authentication of any such copy, certificate, or other document.\nThen section 10 provides:\nThe forms contained in the appendices shall be used in or for the purposes of the prothonotary's office, with such variations as circumstances may require.\nThe form for an execution is the following:\nTITLE OF CAUSE.\nSeal a writ of execution directed to the sheriff of to levy against C.D., the sum of $ and interest thereon at the rate of $6 per centum per annum from the day of (and $ costs) to judgment (or order) dated day of X. Y.\nSolicitor for party on whose behalf writ is to issue.\nTherefore, in my opinion, it is unquestionably the seal which is necessary to the validity of the writ and gives it vitality, and not the signature of the prothonotary. But assuming, for the sake of the argument, that the signature of the prothonotary is necessary his omission to put it to an execution in all other respects regularly issued, as this appears to have been, would amount to no more, in my opinion, than an irregularity and render the writ voidable and not void, and the execution would be a good and valid instrument until set aside which has not been attempted to be done in this case. The following authorities may be referred to on this point:\nChitty's Practice of the Law[18]: The sealing or resealing seems to be considered more important than signing. Original writs issued out of the Court of Chancery, were not only in the King's name, but sealed with his great seal, but mesne process founded thereon always issued under the private seal of the particular court, and not under the great seal, and are tested, not in the King's name, but in the name of the chief justice, or chief baron of the particular court. The seal at present is the same as heretofore. In the King's Bench and Common Pleas the sealing of the writ is considered of principal importance, and is the act which completes its authenticity.\nBacon's Abridgement.\u2014Sheriff M.[19].\n2. That he cannot dispute the authority by which writs issue, nor object to any irregularity in them. Neither the sheriff nor his officers are to dispute the authority of the court out of which any writ, process, or warrant issues, but are at their peril truly to execute all such writs, &c., as are directed to them by the King's judges and justices, according to the command of the said writs, and hereunto they are sworn.\nAnd in Burt v. Jackson[20] Tindall C.J. says:\u2014\nAlthough by the rule of M. T. 3 Will. 4 the filacer is entitled to certain fees for signing writs, it does not therefore follow that he must sign them.\nIn Frost v. Eyles[21], on a motion to set aside a proceeding for irregularity, the name of the filacer not being on a common capias, the court held the proceedings regular, the addition of the filacer's name not being necessary. In Wilson v. Joy[22], it was held that the omission of the name of the chief clerk of the King's Bench on a writ of summons is but an irregularity, and Taunton J. said:\nI think it is sufficient if the writ of summons is conformable to the form given in the schedule of the act.\nAnd the same rule appears to prevail in the United States. In Benjamin v. Armstrong[23] Tilghman C. J. says as to the writ not being signed by the prothonotary: The omission in this case is but an informality; the writ derives authenticity from the seal of the court.\nLessee of Boal v. King[24]. Judge Lane delivered the opinion of the court:\nNo principle is more definitively settled than that the process of a court having a seal can only be evidenced by its seal, which is the appointed mode of showing its authenticity. Without it, a majority of the court hold such process void. The cases in 19 Johns. 170, 5 Cow. 550, and 5 Wend. 133, show the necessity of a seal to writs.\nThe affidavit then being clearly necessary and being, as I think, substantially defective, and the executions having been regularly issued, I think this appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in all the courts below.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am in favor of allowing this appeal for the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal in this case should be dismissed with costs. The bill of sale under consideration does not appear to be avoided by the statute of Elizabeth, and as to the alleged defect in the affidavit filed with the bill of sale, assuming an affidavit to have been necessary in the present case, I do not consider that we are bound by the decision in The Queen v. Bloxham[25] and such like cases, or that they apply in the circumstances of the case before us. In that case a writ of certiorari was quashed because the words \"before me\" were not inserted in the jurat of the affidavit upon which it had been issued, although the name of a commissioner for taking affidavits was inserted at the foot of the jurat. The Court of Queen's Bench held that they had no jurisdiction to grant the certiorari upon such a document. Without evidence of the matter relied upon in the affidavit filed upon a motion for a certiorari the court clearly had no jurisdiction to grant the writ. It was by affidavit alone that the matter necessary to give the jurisdiction could be laid before the court. The court had the right to determine the sufficiency or insufficiency of the mode in which such matter was laid before it, and as it held that the affidavit was defective and could not be amended, there was no matter laid before the court so as to give it jurisdiction to interfere by granting the certiorari. But in the case of these bills of sale, when a question arises affecting their validity, it is raised in a suit in court upon the trial of which evidence upon oath taken in the ordinary way in suits inter partes can be given showing, as matter of fact, that the affidavit was duly sworn before it was filed. The courts in Nova Scotia are not governed in a matter of this nature by the rules by which the Court of Queen's Bench was governed in The Queen v. Bloxham[26]. In an issue in a cause in court whether an affidavit was filed with the bill of sale, the question would be one of fact, to be tried in the ordinary way, upon evidence taken in the cause in court upon the issue joined therein; upon the trial of such an issue the judge presiding could not as a point of law, because of the absence of the words \"before me\" from the jurat, exclude the evidence, for example, of the commissioner whose name was at the foot of the jurat, to the effect that he had administered the affidavit, and that in point of fact it was sworn before him. The Queen v. Bloxham (1) is no authority that upon such an issue such evidence can be excluded; it is, in my judgment, an authority only to the effect that the Court of Queen's Bench in England had no jurisdiction to entertain a motion upon matter which can only be brought to its notice by affidavit, unless the words \"sworn before me\" are inserted in the jurat above the name of the commissioner by whom the affidavit was administered, when the affidavit purports to have been administered by a commissioner, for the same court has held that an affidavit sworn before a judge at chambers will be received on a motion in court although the words \"before me\" do not appear in the jurat. In The Queen v. Bloxham[27] the court held that the defect in the jurat was not amendable although a defect of a somewhat similar nature had been amended by the court, and they pronounced the document upon which the certiorari had been obtained as no affidavit at all and, as such, to have been absolutely void. No such rule of law prevails in the Province of Nova Scotia. Oh. 104 of the Revised Statutes, 5th series, order 36, prescribes all that is necessary to be done by a commissioner in administering an oath taken before him in order to the filing of an instrument, and the words \"before me\" are not there mentioned as necessary to be inserted to give validity to the affidavit, and sec. 14 of that act enacts that:\nThe court or a judge may receive any affidavit for the purpose of being used in any cause or matter notwithstanding any defect by misdescription of parties or otherwise in the title or jurat or any other irregularity in the form thereof.\nSo that the defect in the jurat which, in The Queen v. Bloxham, (1) was pronounced to occasion nullity is, by the law of Nova Scotia, declared to be no nullity, and if not nullity in an affidavit upon which a motion is made in court how can it possibly exclude evidence upon an issue joined inter partes, to show that the affidavit before it was filed was duly administered? Or upon what principle can we hold the case of The Queen v. Bloxham (1), an incontrovertible authority in the Nova Scotia courts governing a case like the present? But, further, the point upon the omission of the words \"before me,\" from the jurat of the affidavit under consideration, does not, as it appears to me, apply in the present case; ch. 92 of the Revised Statutes 5th series, makes a distinction between bills of sale which are absolute or upon trust to sell, and those which are in the nature of chattel mortgages only, to secure by mortgage a debt due to the grantee. Section 1 of the act is the section within which the bill of sale in the present case comes, for it is a bill of sale absolute in its terms and on trust to sell\u2014it requires no affidavit to be filed with it as sec. 4 does with the bills of sale there mentioned which are, as it appears to me, bills of sale by way of chattel mortgage only. The affidavit required by this section shows that the section applies to chattel mortgages only. It enacts that every bill of sale, or chattel mortgage, of personal property, other than certain excepted chattel mortgages, shall be accompanied by an affidavit of the party giving the same that the amount set out therein, as the consideration thereof, is justly due and owing by the grantor to the grantee, showing that the instrument which this affidavit is to accompany is a chattel mortgage securing a debt due to the grantee or mortgagee from the grantor or mortgagor.\nLastly, upon the question as to the validity of the writs of execution under which the appellant claims title to the goods in question, as at present advised I am disposed to regard that as a question of practice and procedure which the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia was itself competent exclusively to determine and the most competent court for the determination of a question of that kind, namely, the essentials necessary and in use, according to the practice of the court, to constitute a valid writ of execution issued by the court, and I do not feel disposed to question, unless absolutely necessary, the judgment of the full court upon this question, and in the view which I take upon the other point it is unnecessary that I should express a conclusive opinion upon the point.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I am happy to say that I find no difficulty in concurring with his lordship the Chief Justice in holding that the writ of fi-fa is not void for want of the signature of the prothonotary. There is a regular judgment, followed by a writ of execution which is sealed with the seal of the court, and in all respects in full compliance with the directions of the judicature act and the orders under the act. If the sheriff is not protected in executing that writ, even if it was the duty of the prothonotary to sign the writ, the law will not be administered, as it strikes me, on the same principle as in the cases of Carrait v. Morley[28] and Hargreaves v Armitage[29] referred to by one of the learned judges in the court below.\nI think he is protected under any of the views of the question of practice which have been presented to us.\nIf we assume, what at present I think would be an incorrect assumption, that the rule which governs these matters in Nova Scotia is to be found in the regulations adopted by the Executive Council in 1749, we find a direction that \"all original process, and all executions, and all process whatsoever, belonging to any matter prosecuted in the general court, be issued from the secretary's office, signed by the clerk of the court, and also be returned into the same office;\" and further, \"that all writs be in the same form as in England.\"\nI borrow the quotation as abbreviated in Leary v. Mitchell by Mr. Justice Ritchie, copies of whose judgment have been furnished to us by the respondent. The order deals of course with writs, one essential of which is the seal.\nA writ, breve, is said to be a formal letter of the King, in parchment, sealed with a seal, &c., &c.[30].\nI understand the regulations to be, as correctly expressed by Mr. Justice Ritchie, \"regulations in respect to the court.\" They provide for the administrative service, but leave the substantial requirements of the writ to follow the English law. No doubt it would be irregular to issue process from any office but that of the secretary, or to return it into any other office, or to omit the signature of the clerk, but those would be venial irregularities. In Leary v. Mitchell the question was only one of irregularity.\nIn his judgment in the case now in hand Mr. Justice Ritchie refers to Hooper v. Lane[31] which turned a good deal upon an arrest made under a document which had been placed in the hands of the sheriff as a writ of capias, but which in Hooper v. Lane (2) was conceded to be void. The learned judge understands the defect to have been that\u2014to quote his own words:\u2014\nThe capias under which the arrest was made was in regular form, properly tested and sealed, but did not have an extra mark or stamp called signing, which was required for the validity of a writ of capias or mesne process.\nWith great respect for the learned judge who has given us, on other branches of this appeal, the assistance of much learning and industry, I am unable to read Hooper v. Lane (2) as he has done. It was an action against the sheriff for negligence in not executing a good capias which the plaintiff had put in his hands against one Bacon. The misadventure was caused by the sheriff having arrested Bacon on the other document, from which arrest he was discharged by a judge's order. What we know of the void writ we learn from the bill of exceptions in the case, and that is that a piece of parchment purporting to be a capias against Bacon at the suit of one Aramburn, indorsed for bail, had been brought to the sheriff's office by an attorney's clerk. The piece of parchment was produced at the trial, purporting to be a writ of capias issued out of the Court of Exchequer at the suit of Aramburn, but it was not duly signed or marked by the sealer of writs, nor had a pr\u00e6cipe thereof been taken to the office of the court according to the practice of the Exchequer. The point in the case was the sheriff's liability for negligence in so acting on this document, which is spoken of not as a void writ only but as no writ at all, as to leave the plaintiffs' good writ unexecuted until Bacon was gone. It was not that the so called writ, which came into being we are not told how, was worse for want of the signature, but that the sheriff had been misled by what was not only worthless in fact but had not on it the indicia of genuineness which a signature would have afforded. The case does not appear to me to touch our subject.\nI suppose, though I have not verified the supposition, that the practice of the Exchequer referred to in the Bill of Exceptions was under a general rule. The rules of Hilary Term, 1832, which applied to all three courts, did not, I believe, regulate the issue of mesne process. They did provide, as to executions, that\nIt shall not be necessary that any writ of execution should be signed; but no such writ shall be sealed till the judgment paper, postea or inquisition has been seen by the proper officer.\nI observe a Common Pleas case, in 1833, Burt v. Jackson[32], the headnote of which is:\nIt is not necessary for the filacer to sign his name to a writ of summons; if he impress upon it the stamp of court it is sufficient, although the rule of Mich. 3 Will. 4, r. 2, allows fees to be taken for signing as well as for sealing the writ.\nAnd approaching a little nearer to the remote date of the order in council, there is this note of an anonymous case in 1814[33]:\nReader moved to set aside proceedings for irregularity, stating that an old copy of writ had been used, with the names of clerks of the court subscribed who were no longer so. Bayley J. That is an immaterial part.\nI have looked rather extensively into the subject, and I have not seen any reason for considering the regulations of the order in council otherwise than directory, and as being matters of practice. It may not add to this to say that they strike me as coming within Order LXVIII., as \"rules of practice for the time being in force.\"\nWe are told that ever since the Judicature Act of 1884 has been in force the practice of signing executions, which had continued from 1747, has been discontinued, signature by the prothonotary not being in terms required by that act which follows in this respect the English rule expressed in the rule of Hilary, 1832, and continued under the Judicature Act 1875.\nA question is made whether the rule of the Judicature Act has superseded the practice as it was before.\nThe practice inaugurated so long ago by the order in council was adopted and continued under the provincial legislation, as has been explained to us, the rule under the statute in the first series of revised statutes requiring in express terms the signature of the officer, and in the later series down to the fourth that express enactment being dropped, but the form appended to the statute continuing to indicate, by a place for the signature, that the practice was to be the same. Of course, whatever has been said as to the directory character of the legislation when it was under the order in council is, to at least as great an extent, applicable to it under these statutes.\nThe provisions of ch. 94 of the fourth series of the Revised Statutes, which included those in question, remain in force only so far as not altered by the Judicature Act[34]. The excepted provisions, some of which relate to executions, are pretty numerous, but those regulating procedure cannot be among them. The mode of issuing executions is one of those things dealt with by the orders under the Judicature Act, and it would be anomalous to hold that an isolated provision of the old statutory rule of practice or procedure, such as that which directs the prothonotary to sign executions, survives to supplement those of the new system.\nThe objection to the assignment by reason of the omission of the words \"before me\" in the jurat of the affidavit is one that I should gladly deal with as it has been ably dealt with in the court below if I could distinguish the case of Parsons v. Brand[35], to which his lordship the Chief Justice called my attention when it appeared in the Times Law Reports. I regret to say that I cannot distinguish it. By section 11 of the Nova Scotia Bills of Sale Act the affidavit required by sections 4 and 5 shall be as nearly as may be in the forms in schedules A and B respectively. Those forms require the commissioner or person before whom the affidavit is taken to certify that it was sworn \"before me.\" Omit those words and the certificate is merely his certificate that it was sworn, which is not as nearly as may be to the same effect. By sec. 4 the mortgage or bill of sale is to be null and void as against creditors unless the prescribed affidavit of bona fides is made, and sec. 11 is imperative that it shall be as nearly as may be in the given form. This is undistinguishable from the English act of 1882 which provides in sec. 9 that the bill of sale shall be void if not made in accordance with the form in the schedule to the act, the form in the schedule containing the words \"add witness's name, address and description.\" The absence of these particulars was held fatal to the bill of sale attacked in the case of Parsons v. Brand[36], for reasons which I can neither controvert nor hold inapplicable to the statute or the facts before us. Some of the decisions in Ontario which have been cited have gone as far as liberal construction of the facts would allow to uphold defective affidavits in cases of this kind, but no case has gone the length we are asked to go in this case and, besides, they have no provision in Ontario like that of the 11th section of the Nova Scotia act. It has been contended that the statute does not, under the circumstances, require this assignment to be accompanied by the affidavit or, indeed, to be registered. I am afraid the circumstances must be somewhat strained to arrive at that conclusion. The first section requires that, at the risk of losing priority over creditors, &c., every bill of sale shall be filed whereby the assignee shall have power, either with or without notice, on the execution thereof or at any subsequent time, to take possession of the property. It cannot be doubted that this bill of sale comes within that category. Possession was not given at the time it was made, and the right to take possession depended on the terms of the deed. The definition of a bill of sale is similar to that contained in the English bills of sale acts, 1878 and 1882, and is illustrated by several decisions; the latest of which is the case of Mills v. Charlesworth[37] which was decided since the argument of this appeal.\nThe first section of the Nova Scotia statute does not require the affidavit now in discussion, but it is required by the 4th section in all cases except those excepted by the tenth section. Assignments for the general benefit of creditors form one exception, but assignments for a select number of creditors, like the deed before us, are not excepted.\nBut it is said that possession was taken by the assignee. His statement is that about two months after the date of the assignment of the 15th of September, 1887, which is the one on which the questions arise, he received another which the assignor, who was in the United States, had executed in order to include all his creditors, but which could not be registered for want of affidavits sworn before a proper person. On receiving that deed the assignee went to the house of the assignor, whose wife was still living there, and removed one piece of furniture to his own house. Two or three days afterwards he took an inventory of all the furniture in the house but permitted the wife to remain in possession and use of it in the house, and she was in possession of it when the sheriff seized.\nThis taking of possession was only formal, there was no actual change of possession.\nWhat the effect of taking actual possession and retaining it might have been I do not think we are called on to consider for the purpose of this case, and I should not venture to do so without more acquaintance than I have at present with the course of decisions in Nova Scotia under this statute.\nThe statute departs from the English bills of sale Acts of 1854 and 1878[38] which furnished the language, at least, in which some of its enactments are partly framed by providing that a bill of sale of the class described in the first section shall take effect, as against persons whom we may in general terms call creditors, only from the time of its registration, in place of the provisions of the English acts that it shall be null and void to all intents and purposes whatsoever so far as regards the property or right to the possession of any personal chattels comprehended in it which at or after the time of the bankruptcy, &c., shall be in possession or apparent possession of the person making such bill of sale, &c. But, while thus dropping the reference to \"apparent possession,\" it retains the definition of those words in the interpretation clause which is borrowed, with slight modifications, from the English statutes. We have thus \"apparent possession\" of an assignor contrasted with \"formal possession;\" and although there is nothing in the statute to declare the effect of the giving or taking of possession, either apparent or formal, we may at least regard the interpretation clause as recognizing the two kinds of possession which may have to be distinguished from each other when questions of possession happen to arise in connection with the working of the act.\nThe formal possession that was taken gave the assignee no better title to the goods than he already had. He had title by the deeds. A delivery by the assignor might perhaps have operated as a conveyance at common law to cure defects, if any there were, in the instruments under which he held, but the assignor did not make any delivery. He executed the deeds, being himself at a distance from the goods, and the assignee thereby acquired the right to take possession or, as expressed in the first section, the power to take possession. The deeds were thus of the category dealt with by the first section and which, under the fourth, were null and void against creditors. The case of Davies v. Jones[39], which was cited by Mr. Eaton, turned on the character of the possession. The assignor sold his goods or stock in trade and went away, and the assignees put an agent of their own in possession to carry on the business for them, and added to the stock. They retained a relative of the assignor in their service in the shop and kept the assignor's sign over the door. The question of \"apparent possession\" was held to be one of fact. It was held that there had not been a mere formal possession but a bon\u00e2 fide sale, an actual delivery, and a complete change of possession, and that it was not within the statute at all. I do not see that that case can aid the argument. Nor can Graham v. Wilcockson[40], another case which was cited. It was an interpleader issue relating to household goods which a landlord had bought from his tenant, taking them in payment of rent, taking possession of them, and then letting them to the tenant at a weekly rent. The tenant signed a paper acknowledging payment for the goods by way of the rent account, and the only question argued in the case was whether the paper was a bill of sale or only a receipt. It was held to be a receipt and therefore not to require registration.\nThe result is that while I am clearly of opinion, for reasons similar to those which I gave at some length in Whitman v. Union Bank of Halifax[41], that the assignment is not bad under the 13 Eliz. c. 5, I have to concur in holding it void under the Nova Scotia Bills of Sale Act for want of a sufficient affidavit of bona fides.\nI agree that we must allow the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Ross, Sedgewick & McKay.\nSolicitors for respondent: Eaton, Parsons & Beckwith.\n[1] 6 Q.

J. Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nPartnership\u2014Fraud against partners\u2014Use of firm name\u2014Promissory note\u2014Authority to sign\u2014Notice to person talcing.\nE. was a member of the firm of S. C. & Co. and also a member of the firm of E. & Co., and in order to raise money for the use of E. & Co. he made a promissory note which he signed with the name of the other firm and indorsing it in the name of E. & Co. had it discounted. The officers of the bank which discounted the note knew the handwriting of E. with whom the bank had had frequent dealings. In an action against the makers of the note C. pleaded that it was made by E. in fraud of his partners and the jury found that S. C. & Co. had not authorized the making of the note but did not answer questions submitted as to the knowledge of the bank of want of authority.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that the note was made by E. in fraud of his partners and that the bank had sufficient knowledge that he was using his partners' names for his own purposes to put them on inquiry as to authority. Not having made such inquiry the bank could not recover against C.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia setting aside a verdict at the trial for the defendant, Creighton, and ordering a new trial.\nThe action was on a promissory note. The defendant Creighton entered an appearance and pleaded that the note was made by his partner Esson without his knowledge or consent and used by Esson for his own private purposes. The evidence at the trial showed that Esson was also a member of the firm of Esson & Co., which was largely indebted to the plaintiff bank, and the note was endorsed by Esson, in the name of the firm, to the bank to reduce such indebtedness. Certain questions were submitted to the jury which, with their findings, are as follows:\u2014\n1. Did the defendant Creighton authorise Wm. Esson to sign the note in question with the name of S. Creighton & Co.? No.\n2. Where the proceeds of the note appropriated by the plaintiff bank, at the request of William Esson, to the payment of the indebtedness of Esson & Co. to the plaintiff bank? Yes.\n3. Was the firm of Esson & Co., when this note was discounted, financially embarrassed, and did the cashier of the plaintiff bank know this? Yes.\n4. Had the plaintiff bank, at the time this note was discounted, notice that William Esson had no authority to sign the name of the firm of S. Creighton & Co. to this note? Don't know.\n5 Was the plaintiff company or its officers aware, when this note was discounted, of circumstances connected with the business transactions of the firm of Esson & Co. with the plaintiff bank which would, or ought to, raise in the mind of the cashier of the bank a reasonable doubt as to the authority of William Esson to sign this note? Yes.\n6. Had the firm of S. Creighton & Co. ever given authority to William Esson or the firm of Esson & Co. to sign notes for them in the management of the business of the firm of S. Creighton & Co.? No.\n7. Had the firm of S. Creighton & Co. ever given authority to William Esson or to Esson & Co. to sign notes in the name of S. Creighton & Co. and appropriate the proceeds to the credit of Esson & Co? No.\n8. Did the cashier of the plaintiff bank discount this note with the intention and purpose to appropriate the proceeds to the reduction of the account of Esson & Co. with the plaintiff bank? Yes.\n9. Was the cashier of the plaintiff bank justified, from his former dealings with Samuel Creighton of the firm of Creighton & Co., in believing that William Esson was authorised in signing this note for the firm of Creighton & Co? No.\nThe following additional questions were submitted at the instance of plaintiffs' counsel:\n10. Did the plaintiff bank or the manager know when the note was discounted that the firm of S. Creighton & Co. was not indebted to the firm of Esson & Co? Don't know.\n11. Did the plaintiff bank in discounting the said note know that Esson, made the note in fraud of his copartner? Don't know.\n12. Did the plaintiff bank give value for the said note? They did by placing the proceeds to the credit of Esson & Co.\n13. Did Esson when, or shortly before, the note was offered for discount inform the manager of the bank that the firm of S. Creighton & Co. was indebted to the firm of Esson & Co.? Don't know.\n14. Did the plaintiff bank pay the proceeds of the said note to Esson or to Esson & Co.? To Esson & Co.\nUpon these findings judgment was entered for the defendant. On motion to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia this judgment was set aside and a new trial ordered, the majority of the court being of opinion that it was essential that the jury should find upon the fact whether or not the bank knew, when discounting the note, that it was made by Esson in fraud of his copartner, and that the jury having answered \"don't know\" to questions involving such knowledge there was no such finding and no verdict could be entered. The defendant appealed from the judgment ordering a new trial.\nNewcombe for the appellant. The fact that the bank had sufficient knowledge of want of authority in Esson to make the note to put them to inquiry before discounting it is sufficiently found by the questions answered. See In re Richards[1]; Leverson v. Lane[2]; Kendall v. Wood[3].\nRussell Q.C. for the respondents. There is a distinction between a partner ostensibly acting on his own behalf or acting as agent for a lesser firm. Ames Select Cases on Bills and Notes[4].\nThe rights of a third party taking such paper will vary according to the form of the instrument. See ex parte Bushell[5]; Ridley v. Taylor[6].\nNewcombe was not called upon to reply.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014We do not think it necessary to hear further argument in this case. I think the evidence and findings of the jury afford sufficient material to establish that Esson signed the note in question in the name of the firm of Creighton & Co. without the authority of his co-partners, that he endorsed it in the name of Esson & Co.\u2014whether with or without authority is not material\u2014and that he took it to the bank and had it discounted, and I am of opinion that the bank had a fair intimation that Esson was using the name of the firm, of which Creighton was a partner, for his own private purposes, which was an illegal transaction; therefore, I think it should have put the bank on inquiry as to Esson's authority, and the facts shown threw on the plaintiffs the burthen of showing that the transaction was a right and proper one. Had they made the inquiries they should have made they would have seen that Esson was using the name of Creighton & Co. without authority, and that they should not have discounted the note. Not having made such inquiries the loss should not fall upon Creighton, the partner whose name was unlawfully used, but upon the bank.\nThe judgment of the learned Chief Justice at the trial rightly stated the law, and I cannot think there could be a doubt in anybody's mind as to its correctness. The appeal should be allowed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014There were two firms with two partners common to each, the firm of Creighton & Company composed of Creighton (the present appellant) Esson and Anderson; this firm carried on business as lumber merchants at Liscomb; then there was the firm of Esson & Company, composed of Esson & Anderson, which carried on business as general merchants at Halifax. The circumstance that there were in the present case two partners instead of one common to each firm constitutes the only difference between this case and those of Leverson v. Lane[7], and Re Riches[8], in both of which the facts were that the name of the firm was, in fraud of the partnership, attached by one partner to securities which he applied for his own individual benefit. The circumstances that there are here two partners who are members of each firm is, of course, wholly immaterial.\nEsson made the note sued upon payable to Esson & Co. and signed to it the name of Creighton & Co. and endorsed it in the name of Esson & Co. The respondents then discounted it and placed the proceeds to the credit of Esson & Co. who kept an account with them\nThe law applicable to such a state of facts was laid down with great clearness by Lord Westbury L. C. in re Riches[9], to be as follows:\u2014\nIf an individual partner gives directly to his private creditor the paper of his firm for his own individual benefit, and thus uses the credit of the firm for his own private purposes, in that case such partner is guilty of fraud.\nSuch a transaction, Lord Justice Lindley says (Lindley on Partnership)[10].\nIs fraudulent against the firm whose name is affixed to the paper even if the partner using it does not himself sign the name of the firm; a fortiori when he does sign it.\nSee also Smith's Mercantile law[11]; Leverson v. Lane[12]; re Riches (1).\nThe person who accepts the paper having, from the very nature of the transaction, prim\u00e2 facie notice that the partner in applying the security of the firm for his own private ends is acting beyond the scope of his authority as a partner, and is thus committing a fraud upon the other partners, is put upon inquiry, by which it is meant that he takes the paper at his peril and cannot afterwards protect himself by saying that he had not notice of the particulars of the fraud upon the firm. In other words, the party taking the bill or note has cast upon him the onus of establishing that no fraud was perpetrated by proving that the transaction was with the assent of the other partners or in some way for the benefit of the firm.\nIn the case of The Bank of Commerce v. Moul[13] the bank when it took the note had no notice that the partner from whom it received it was using it for his own purposes, for it was found as a fact in that case that the manager of the bank did not know that McCarthy, the fraudulent partner, was a member of the firm. It is beyond doubt in the present case that the bank through its officers, Mr. Pitcaithly and Mr. McIntyre, had notice that the signature of Creighton & Co. to this note was signed by Esson. They had had dealings with Esson and well knew his handwriting. The case on that point of evidence is as strong as it possibly could be. The bank must, therefore, when the proceeds of the discount were applied by placing them to the credit of Esson & Co., have been aware that the paper and credit of Creighton & Co. were being used by Esson, one of the partners in that firm, for the benefit of Esson & Co., a firm in which, as they knew, Creighton had no concern or interest. The case is thus brought directly within the principles laid down by Lord Westbury and by the Court of Common Pleas in the authorities already quoted; it was, therefore, for the bank, if they could, to shew that Creighton, the appellant, had assented to such a use of the name of his firm, or that the latter firm had reaped the benefit of the transaction, but this they have wholly failed to do. The judgment of Mr. Justice Townshend in the court in banc and that of the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia at the trial were, consequently, in all respects right both as regards the conclusion arrived at and the reasons assigned.\nMr. Russell has argued the appeal with great ingenuity but he has, I think, failed to establish that the case is not covered by the English authorities before referred to which, as appears from the work of Lord Justice Lindley as well from the late Edition of Smith's Mercantile Law, are now universally recognised as having established a settled principle of commercial law.\nThe judgment must be that the appeal should be allowed and that an order discharging the rule for a pew trial be entered in the court below, and the judgment for the defendant which was pronounced by the Chief Justice at the trial restored with costs to the appellant in all the courts.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I think the judgment should be for the defendant, and that the appeal should be allowed, for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Townshend in the court below.\nTASCHEREAU and GWYNNE JJ. Concurred.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I also concur. I read the case with some care before the argument and do not think there is any reason for delaying the judgment.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: E. L.

Ritchie C.J. and Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOYA SCOTIA.\nAction\u2014Notice of\u2014Contractor to build Government Railway\u2014Government Railway Act, 44 Vic. ch. 25, s. 109\u2014Construction of term \"employee.\"\nSec. 109 of the Government Railway Act of 1881, (44 Vic. ch. 25), provides that \"no action shall be brought against any officer, employee or servant of the department, [Railways and Canals], for anything done by virtue of his office, service or employment, except within three months after the act committed, and upon one month's previous notice in writing.\"\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, Ritchie C. J. and Gwynne J. dissenting, that a contractor with the Minister of Railways and Canals, as representing the crown, for the construction of a branch of the Intercolonial Railway, is not an \"employee\" of the department within this section.\nHeld, per Patterson and Fournier JJ., that the compulsory powers given to the Government of Canada to expropriate lands required for any public work can only be exercised after compliance with the statute requiring the land to be set out by metes and bounds and a plan or description filed; if these provisions are not complied with, and there is no order-in-council authorizing land to be taken when an order-in-council is necessary, a contractor with the crown who enters upon the land to construct such public work thereon is liable to the owner in trespass for such entry.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favor of the plaintiff.\nThis was an action for trespass on plaintiff's land. The defendants were contractors with the Dominion Government, represented by the Minister of Railways and Canals, for the construction of a branch of the Intercolonial Railway at Dartmouth, N. S. The plaintiff's land was expropriated by the Government for the purposes of the railway, and an action was brought in the Exchequer Court and damages recovered therein by the plaintiff in respect of such expropriation, and to the present action the defendants pleaded that the plaintiff having admitted the right of the crown to expropriate the land could not now claim that the entry by defendants, which was for the purpose of executing the work for which the expropriation was made, was a wrongful entry. Another defence pleaded was that the defendants, by virtue of their contract, were employees of the Department of Railways and Canals within the meaning of sec. 109 of the Government Railways Act of 1881, and entitled to notice of action which they had never received.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia decided the case in favor of the defendants upon this latter ground, reversing the judgment of the Chief Justice at the trial who had awarded the plaintiff $100.00 damages. The plaintiff then brought the present appeal.\nWallace for the appellant referred to Abbott's Law Dictionary under the word \"servant\" and Bouvier title \"employ\u00e9,\" to show that defendants were not \"employees\" under the statute.\nBorden for the respondent, cited on the same point Lowther v. Earl of Radnor[2]; Ellis v. Sheffield Gas Co.[3]; Water Co. v. Ware[4]; and contended that as the crown was in possession of the land no action would lie against the defendants who were on the land merely as the servants or agents of the crown, citing Carr v. United States[5]; The Davis[6]. Sir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014Sec. 109 of the Government Railways Act is as follows: \u2014\nNo action shall be brought against any officer, employee or servant of a department for anything done by virtue of his office, service or employment, unless within three months after the act committed and upon one month's previous notice thereof in writing, and the action shall be tried in the county or judicial district where the cause of action arose.\nIn this case there was no notice of action; the Government undertook to perform certain work which, as they could not do it personally, they agreed with, that is to say they employed, the defendants for a certain consideration to do it. Whether the agreement was in the nature of a contract in writing or verbal for a fixed sum or otherwise to do certain specified work, can it be said that those who agreed to do the work were not employed to do it? And if so, how can it be said they were not employees of the parties for whom they were to do the work? Though those who actually did the work may properly be called contractors, as between the Government and themselves, how did that make them the less persons employed to do the work and, therefore, the less employees of the Government? By what process of reasoning can it be said that the contractors in this case were not employed to do this work, and did not become employees of the crown, or that what they did was not done by virtue of their office, service or employment? By the terms of their contract what they were employed to do was:\nTo provide all and every kind of labor, machinery and other plant, articles and things whatsoever necessary for the due execution and completion of all and every the works set out or referred to in the specifications annexed, &c. in the manner required by, and in strict conformity with, the said specifications and drawings relating thereto and the working and detail drawings which may from time to time be furnished, (which said specifications and drawings were thereby declared to be part of the contract) and to the complete satisfaction of the chief engineer for the time being having control over the work. The said contract gave the chief engineer, with the sanction of the Minister, liberty at any time, before the commencement or during the construction of the works, or any portion thereof, to order any work to be done or to make any changes which he might deem expedient in the grades, width of cuttings and fillings, nature, character or position of the works or any part or parts thereof, or any other thing connected with the works, or connected with such changes, &c., and provided that the contractors should immediately comply with all written requisitions of the engineer in that behalf, but that they should not make any change in, or addition to or omission or deviation from, the works unless directed by the engineer, and should not be entitled to any payment therefor unless first directed in writing by the engineer to make such changes, etc., nor unless the price to be paid for any additional work was previously fixed by the Minister in writing, and the decision of the engineer as to whether such change or deviation increased or diminished the cost of the work and the amount to be paid or deducted therefor, as the case might be, should be final, and the obtaining of his certificate should be a condition precedent to the right of the contractors to be paid therefor. If any such change or alteration should, in the opinion of the engineer, constitute a deduction from the works his decision as to the amount to be deducted on account thereof should be final and binding. The engineer by the said contract was the sole judge of the work and material in respect to both quantity and quality, and his decision in respect to disputes with regard to work or material, or as to the meaning or intention of the contract and the plans, etc., was to be final.\nThe contract also provided that a competent foreman should be kept on the ground by the contractors during all the working hours to receive the orders of the engineer, and should the person so appointed be deemed by the engineer incompetent or conduct himself improperly he might be discharged by the engineer, and another should at once be appointed in his stead. Such foreman should be considered the lawful representative of the contractors and should have full power to carry out all requisitions and instructions of the engineer.\nSec. 12. All machinery and other plant, material and things whatsoever provided by the contractors for the works hereby contracted for, and not rejected under the provisions of the last preceding clause, shall from the time of their being so provided become, and until the final completion of the said works shall be, the property of Her Majesty for the purposes of the said works, and the same shall on no account be taken away 01 used or disposed of except for the purposes of the said works, without the consent in writing of the engineer.\nSec. 13. If the engineer shall at any time consider the number of workmen, horses or quantity of machinery or other plant, or the quantity of proper material respectively employed or provided by the contractor on or for the said works, to be insufficient for the advancement thereof towards completion within the limited time, or that the works are, or some part thereof is, not being carried on with true diligence, then in every such case the said engineer may by written notice to the contractors require them to employ or provide such additional workmen, etc., as the engineer may think necessary, and in case the contractors shall not thereupon within three days or such other longer period as may be fixed by any such notice in all respects comply therewith then the engineer may, either on behalf of Her Majesty, or if he see fit may as the agent of and on account of the contractor but in either case at the expense of the contractors, provide and employ such additional workmen, etc., as he may think proper, and may pay such additional workmen such wages and for such additional horses, etc., such prices as he may think proper, and all such wages and prices respectively shall thereupon at once be repaid by the contractors, or the same may be retained and deducted out of any moneys at any time payable to the contractors.\nSec. 28. Her Majesty shall have the right to suspend operations from time to time at any particular point or points or upon the whole of the works, and in the event of such right being exercised so as to cause delay to the contractors, then an extension of time equal to such delay or detention, to be fixed by the Ministers as above provided for, shall be allowed them to complete the contract, but no such delay shall vitiate or avoid this contract or any part thereof.\nSec. 35. In the event of it becoming advisable in the interests of the public to suspend the work hereby contracted for or any portion thereof, at any time before its completion, and to put an end to this contract, the Minister for the time being shall have full power to stop the work and cancel this contract, on giving due notice to that effect to the contractors.\nThese provisions clearly show that the whole work was performed under the control and immediate superintendence of the Government and appear to me to bring this case directly within the case of Newton v. Ellis[7]. In that case it was claimed as in this case that the contractor was entitled to notice under 11 & 12 Vic. ch. 63, sec. 139, which is as follows:\u2014\nAnd be it enacted, that no writ or process shall be sued out against or served upon any Superintending Inspector or any officer or person acting in his aid, or under the direction of the general Board of Health, nor against the local Board of Health, or any members thereof or the officer of health, clerk, surveyor, inspector of nuisances, or other officer or person whomsoever acting under the direction of the said local board, for anything done or intended to be done under the provisions of this Act, until the expiration of one month next after notice in writing shall have been delivered to him, or left at their or his office, or usual place of abode, clearly and explicitly stating the cause of action, and the name and place of abode of the intended plaintiff, and of his attorney or agent in the cause; and upon the trial of any such action the plaintiff shall not be permitted to go into evidence of any cause of action which is not stated in the last mentioned notice and unless such notice be proved the jury shall find for the defendant; and every such action shall be brought or commenced within six months next after the accrual of the cause of action, and shall be laid and tried in the county or place where the cause of action occurred, and not elsewhere, and the defendant shall be at liberty to plead the general issue, and give this Act and all special matter in evidence thereunder, and any person to whom such notice of action is given as aforesaid may tender amends to the plaintiff, his attorney or agent, at any time within one month after service of such notice.\nIn fact the present case appears to me to be stronger, for here the word \"employee\" is specifically used which is not the case in the statute referred to.\nIn Newton v. Ellis[8], Lord Campbell C. J. says:\u2014\nI am of the opinion that the defendant was a \"person\" acting under the direction of the local board in doing what the declaration complains of. The declaration complains of his wrongfully, negligently and improperly making or digging a hole or cutting, and continuing it without placing a sufficient light, whereby the plaintiff was injured and his carriage broken. The contract shews that the defendant was acting under the direction of the board; he contracted with them to make the well; and in this particular contract there is a stipulation which removes all doubt. We are not bound to lay down any general rule; the contract here requires all to be done to the satisfaction of the surveyor and by his direction; and Mr. Bittleston very properly admits that the surveyor is for this purpose indentified with the board. That is not all; the surveyor has power to interfere; he may dismiss any workman if he is dissatisfied with the way in which the workman performs the works. The defendant was emphatically a person acting under the direction of the board.\nColeridge J.:\nThere are two things which have been perhaps a little confounded. The question where the work has been done by an independent contractor or by a servant relates only to the liability of the principal. But, so far as regards the effect of a clause such as the one now in question, what the contractor does is done under the direction of the party with whom he contracts for that purpose.\nIn Ellis v. Sheffield Gas Co.,[9]. Lord Campbell C. J. says:\u2014\nI am clearly of opinion that if the contractor does the thing he is employed to do, the employer is responsible for that thing as if he had done it himself.\nHe also says:\nIt would be monstrous if a person causing another to do a thing were exempted from liability for that act merely because there was a contract between him and the person immediately causing the act to be done.\nIn Hole v. Sitting-Bourne and Sheerness Railway Co.[10]. Pollock C. B. says:\nI am of opinion that the rule must be discharged. The short ground on which my judgment proceeds is, that this does not fall within that class of cases where the principalis exempt from responsibility because he is not the master of the person whose negligence or improper conduct has caused the mischief. This is a case in which maxim qui facit per alium facit per se applies. Where a person is authorized by act of parliament or bound by contract to do particular work he cannot avoid responsibility by contracting with another person to do the work. In Ellis v. The Sheffield Gas Consumers Co.[11] Lord Campbell said it is \"a proposition absolutely untenable that in no case can a man be responsible for the act of a person with whom he has made a contract. I am clearly of opinion that if the contractor does the thing which he is employed to do the employer is responsible for that thing as if he did it himself.\" Here the contractor was employed to make a bridge, and he did make a bridge, which obstructed the navigation. The case then falls within the principle laid down in Ellis v. The Sheffield Gas Consumers Co. (1).\nWilde B.:\nBut when the thing contracted to be done causes the mischief, and the injury can only be said to arise from the authority of the employer because the thing contracted to be done is imperfectly performed, there the employer must be taken to have authorized the act and is responsible for it. The present defendants were authorized to take land for the purpose of their railway, and to build a bridge over the Swale. Instead of erecting the bridge themselves they employed another person to do it. What was done was done under their authority. In the course of executing their order the contractor, by doing the work imperfectly, obstructed the navigation. It is the same as if they had done it themselves. It is not distinguishable from the case where a landowner orders a person to erect a building upon his land which causes a nuisance. The person who ordered the structure to be put up is liable, and it is no answer for him to say that he ordered it to be put up in a different form.\nHow then can there be an employer and not an employee? I am very clearly of opinion that the contractor in the present case is an employee within the meaning of sec. 109 of the Government Railways Act of 1881, and therefore entitled to the notice provided for by that section, and not having received such notice the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. I therefore think that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am in favor of allowing the appeal for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Patterson in his judgment in this case.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am also of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This case would appear to be by way of supplementary claim to that in Kearney v. The Queen, in which the present appellant obtained in this court the sum of $5,131.60 by way of compensation, in lieu of $2,012.00 with interest on $1,512.00 from the 23rd August, 1884, awarded to her by the Exchequer Court for the same land, for entry upon which this action was brought, taken by the Dominion Government for the Dartmouth Branch of the Intercolonial Railway, and which has been constructed upon the land so taken.\nA statement of the facts will serve, I think, to show the utter absence of all merit in the plaintiff's claim, which, if she shall succeed, will afford a marked instance of the triumph of the merest technicality against the justice of the case.\nBy an act passed by the legislature of the Province of Nova Scotia, upon the 19th day of April, 1883, 46 Vic. ch. 33, the municipality of the Town of Dartmouth was empowered to enter into an agreement with the Government of Canada represented by the Minister of Railways of Canada, or with the Government of Nova Scotia represented by the Commissioner of Works and Mines for the province of Nova Scotia for the time being, for the payment to such Government of a sum not exceeding $4,000.00, for a period not exceeding twenty years, or in the alternative a sum not exceeding two thousand dollars per annum for a period not exceeding forty years, in the event of the Intercolonial Railway or a line of railway connected therewith being extended into the Town of Dartmouth to a point to be determined in such manner as should be approved by the town council. With the view apparently of giving effect to this act of the legislature of Nova Scotia, the Parliament of Canada by the act 46 Vic. ch. 2, passed on the 25th May, 1883, granted a sum of\n$110,000 for a branch of the Intercolonial Railway to Dartmouth, provided the Municipality of Dartmouth undertake the payment to the Government of the amount of $4,000 per annum for twenty years, or so much of that amount as may be required in addition to the net revenue to pay four per centum per annum on the sum expended.\nIt appears that on or about the 12th of June, 1883, an agreement in accordance with the provisions of the above statute, 46 Vic. ch. 2, in relation to the grant of the $110,000 was entered into between the Government of Canada and the Corporation of Dartmouth. Thereupon the Minister of Railways, thinking himself to be justified in proceeding to have a survey made for the purpose of determining the route of the proposed branch railway, and of acquiring the right of way, proceeded to act under the provisions of the Dominion acts, 31 Vic. ch. 12, 35 Vic. ch. 24, 37 Vic. ch. 15, and 44 Vic. ch. 25, certain sections of which acts appeared to him to afford ample authority for every thing done or authorized to be done by him in the circumstances as they then existed.\nBy the 10th sec. of 31 Vic. ch. 12, among the works there enumerated as placed under the control and management of the Minister of Public Works, are:\nThe railways and rolling stock thereon, and also the works acquired or to be acquired, constructed or to be constructed, repaired or improved at the expense ot Canada.\nBy the 22nd section the Minister is empowered to authorise: The engineer, agents, servants, and workmen employed by or under him to enter into and upon any ground to whomsoever belonging and to survey and take levels of the same, and to make such borings and sink such trial pits as he deems to be necessary for any purpose relative to the works under his management.\nThen by the 24th section it is enacted that:\nThe Minister may at all times acquire and take possession for and in the name of Her Majesty of any land or real estate, etc., the appropriation of which is in his judgment necessary for the use, construction and maintenance of any public work, etc., and he may for such purpose contract, and agree with all persons possessed of or interested in such land, real property, etc., and all such contracts and agreements shall be valid to all intents and purposes whatever.\nBy the 26th section it is enacted that:\nThe compensation agreed on between the parties or awarded in the manner hereinafter set forth, shall be paid for such land, real property, etc., to the owners within six months after the amount of such compensation has been agreed on or awarded.\nBy the 27th section it is enacted that:\nWhen any such owner refuses or fails to agree for conveying his estate or interest in any land, real property, etc., the Minister may tender the reasonable value in his estimation of the same with notice that the question will be submitted to the arbitrators hereinafter mentioned, and in every case the Minister may, three days after such agreement or tender and notice, authorise possession to be taken of such land, real property, etc., so agreed or tendered for.\nBy the 34th section:\nIf any person or body corporate has any claim for property taken or for alleged direct or consequential damage to property arising from the construction or connected with the execution of any public work undertaken, commenced or performed at the expense of the Dominion, etc., such person or body corporate may give notice in writing of such claim to the said Minister, etc., who may, within thirty days after such notice, tender what he considers a just satisfaction for the same with notice that the said claim will be submitted to the decision of the arbitrators acting under this Act, unless the sum so tendered is accepted, etc.\n2. But before any claim under this or any other section of this Act shall be arbitrated upon the claimant shall give security to the satisfaction of the arbitrators or any one of them for the payment of the costs and expenses incurred by the arbitration, in the event of the award being against such claimant or of its not exceeding the sum tendered as aforesaid.\nBy the 35th clause the Minister may refer any of the clauses aforesaid either to one or any greater number of arbitrators as he may see fit, subject, however, in the case of a reference to one arbitrator or to a less number than the full board to an appeal to the full board which is provided for by section 44.\nBy the statute 35 Vic. ch. 24, passed on the 14th June, 1872, the above 10th section of 31 Vic. ch. 12 is amended and extended, for it is enacted thereby that every work of the nature of any of those mentioned in the 10th section of 31 Vic. ch. 12:\nAcquired or to be acquired, constructed or to be constructed, extended, enlarged, repaired or improved at the expense of the Dominion of Canada, or for the acquisition, construction, requiring, extending, enlarging or improving of which any public money has been or shall be hereafter voted and appropriated by Parliament, and every work required for any such purpose, is and shall be a public work, under the control and management of the Minister of Public Works, and all the provisions of the said Act, and of any Act amending it, do and shall apply to every such work as aforesaid, and all the powers, privileges and duties thereby vested or assigned to the Minister of Public Works may be exercised by the said Minister in relation to any and every such work, subject always to the exceptions made in the said tenth section of the said Act, etc. Provided that this Act shall not apply to any work for which money has been appropriated as a subsidy only.\nBy 37 Vic. ch. 15, passed on the 26th May, 1874, it was enacted that from and after the 1st day of June, 1874:\nThe Intercolonial Railway shall be a public work vested in Her Mujesty, and under the control and management of the Minister of Public Works, etc.\nAnd further that the powers of the commissioners appointed under the act 31 Vic. ch. 13, respecting the construction of the Intercolonial Railway thereby transferred to the Minister of Public Works, should\u2014\nas respects the said Intercolonial Railway and works be in addition to any powers the said Minister may as such have with respect to the same as a public work, under 31 Vic. ch. 12, and the Minister may in any case relating to the said railway and works exercise any powers given him by either of the said Acts, and applicable to such case.\nThen by 42 Vic. ch. 7, 1879, the Public Works Department was divided into two departments, namely, the Department of Railways and Canals, presided over and managed by an officer designated \"Minister of Railways and Canals,\" and the Department of Public Works, presided over and managed by an officer designated \"Minister of Public Works,\" and it was thereby enacted that the Minister of Railways and Canals should have the management, charge and direction of all railways, and works and property appertaining or incident thereto, which were, or immediately before the coming of the act into force might be, under the management and direction of the Department of Public Works, and to the same extent and under the same provisions, subject to those of the act, and that the Minister of Railways and the officer acting under him should, as respects the works under his charge and direction, have all the powers and duties which at the time of the act coming into force should be vested in the Department of Public Works as formerly constituted, and that the Minister of Railways and the officers acting under him as to such works as should be under his charge should be deemed to be successors in office of the former Minister of Public Works and the officers acting under him or his department. This act, in pursuance of a provision in that behalf in the act, came into force by proclamation upon the 30th May, 1879.\nNow, upon the organization of the Department of Railways and Canals under this act, it cannot, I think, be doubted that the Intercolonial Railway and all works thereafter to be constructed by public money of the Dominion must be regarded as being public works under the control, direction and management of the Minister of Railways, and that, unless there be some express provision in some subsequent act of Parliament, plainly and in unequivocal terms enacting to the contrary, upon the perfection of the arrangement between the Government of Canada and the Corporation of Dartmouth, as provided in 46 Vic. ch. 2, the Minister of Railways became invested with all the powers contained in 31 Vic. ch. 12, and which were necessary for the purpose of determining the site by survey and of acquiring the right of way for the construction of the Dartmouth branch of the Intercolonial Railway as a public work of the Dominion of Canada without any powers or authorities whatever additional to those contained in 31 Vic. ch. 12.\nUpon the 21st of March, 1881, The Government Railway Act, 44 Vic. ch. 25, was passed. That act increases rather than diminishes the powers vested in the Minister by 31 Vic. ch. 12, 35 Vic. ch. 24 and 37 Vic. ch. 15.\nThe 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th sub-sections of sec. 5 of 44 Vic. ch. 25 correspond with sec. 22 of 31 Vic. ch. 12. By this 5th section and sub-sections it is enacted that:\nThe Minister shall have full power and authority by himself, his engineers, superintendent, agents, workmen and servants\u2014\n1. To explore and survey the country through which it is proposed to construct any Government railway;\n2. And for that purpose to enter into and upon any public lands or the lands of any corporation or person whatsoever;\n3. To make surveys, examinations or other arrangements on such lands necessary for fixing the site of the railway, and to set out and ascertain such parts of the land as shall be necessary and proper for the railway;\n5. To enter upon and take possession of any lands, real estate, streams, waters and water-courses, the appropriation of which is in his judgment necessary for the use, construction, maintenance or repair of the railway. Then the 15th sub-section of this section 5 made provision for the Minister contracting with the owners for the land required, corresponding with the provisions of sec. 27 of 31 Vic. ch. 121, and the 17th sub-section made this aditional provision that the Minister should have full power\u2014\nAt any time to change the location of the line of railway in any particular part for the purpose of lessening a curve, reducing a gradient or otherwise benefiting such line of railway or for any other purpose of public advantage; and all and every the provisions of this act shall refer as fully to the part of such railway, so at any time changed or proposed to be changed, as to the original line.\nThen the 10th section of 44 Vic. ch. 25 enacted that:\nWhere no proper deed or conveyance to the crown is made and executed by the person having the power to make such deed or conveyance, or where a person interested in such lands is incapable of making such deed or conveyance, or where for any other reason the Minister shall deem it advisable so to do, a plan and description of such lands, signed by the Minister, his deputy or secretary, or by the superintendent, or by an engineer of the department, or by a land surveyor duly licensed and sworn in and for the province in which the lands are situate, shall be deposited of record in the office of registry of deeds for the county or registration division in which the lands are situate, and such lands by such deposit shall thereupon become and remain vested in the crown;\n2. In case of any omission, mis-statement or erroneous description in such plan or description, a corrected plan and description may be deposited with like effect;\n3. Such plan and description may be deposited at any time either before entry upon the lands or within twelve months thereafter.\nSection 11 made binding all contracts at the price agreed upon for lands which might be purchased for the railway\nbefore the setting out and ascertaining of the lands required if they should be set out and ascertained within a year from the date of the contract even although land may, in the meantime, have become the property of a third party.\nThen sec. 15 of 44 Vic. ch. 25 made provision for tender of compensation, and arbitration if tender should be refused, corresponding with sec. 27 of 31 Vic. ch. 12, and sections 27, 28, 30 and 31 of 44 Vic., all relating to arbitration, correspond severally and respectively with sections 34, 35, 37 and 38 of 31 Vic. ch. 12.\nActing under the powers vested in the Minister by the several sections of the acts above referred to the Minister, after the agreement of the 12th June, 1883, between the municipality of Dartmouth and the Dominion Government, as contemplated by the above extract from the Dominion Statute 46 Vic. ch. 2, had been entered into, proceeded to have a survey made for determining the route of the proposed railway, and had it staked out upon the ground in the usual manner for designating the line of the railway by stakes planted in the ground showing the centre line of the railway. The plaintiff was then approached by persons acting under the authority of the Minister with the view of making a contract with her for the purchase of the portion of her land required for the railway. She appears to have, at first, expressed herself as willing to take $200, and afterwards to have demanded $1,000, and finally to have refused to enter into any arrangement without the approbation of her solicitor who appears to have advised her to agree to nothing but to insist upon such compensation as should be awarded to her under the statutes in that behalf. Upon the 3rd of April, 1884, the Minister had a tender made to her and a notice served upon her in accordance with the provisions of section 27 of 31 Vic. ch. 12, and of section 15 of 44 Vic. ch. 25. In this notice the land mentioned as taken was described as embracing a width of twenty feet throughout the plaintiffs lot on each side of the centre line of the railway \"as shown on the plan filed in the office of the Chief Engineer at Moncton.\" At this time the engineer was, however, making a slight alteration in the width of the land proposed to be taken; no alteration was made in the centre line as staked upon the ground, but only in the width of the land taken on either side of such centre line. This location of the railway appears to have been finally completed before the 9th of April. 1884, by a plan and description of the land as taken which were filed in the office of the registrar of deeds for the county of Halifax, in pursuance of the provisions of sec. 10 of 44 Vic. ch. 25, on the 13th of August, 1884, wherein the land as taken upon the 9th of April, 1884, is described as follows:\u2014\nNow, it is hereby declared and made known that the said lands are described as follows, that is to say: Beginning at a point where the centre line of the Dartmouth Branch Railway intersects the northern boundary line of the lot belonging to the said Maria Kearney, thence southerly following the several courses of the said centre line a distance of one hundred and forty-eight feet, embracing a width of twenty feet on the eastern and fifteen feet on the western side of the said centre line, thence southerly a further distance of two hundred and fifty feet along the said centre line embracing a width of twenty feet on each side of the same, thence southerly a further distance of five hundred feet along the said centre line, embracing a width of thirty feet on the eastern and twenty-five feet on the western side of the same; thence southerly a further distance along the said centre line of two hundred and forty-one feet more or less, or to the southern boundary line of the said lot, embracing a width of twenty-five feet on each side of the said centre line, the whole containing an acre and twenty-six hundredths of an acre, more or less, being land and land covered with water as shown on annexed plan colored red.\nWhether any notice was served upon the plaintiff showing this trifling variation from the land as described in the notice served upon her on the 3rd of April does not appear. Most probably the slight variation was deemed to be quite immaterial as it seems to have been, for the plaintiff in any arbitration must have recovered compensation for the land actually taken however erroneously it had been described in the notice served upon her on the 3rd of April; and if she had found any difficulty upon that point she herself could have taken the initiative under the 34th section of 31 Vic. ch. 12, or the 27th section of 44 Vic. ch. 25, to have compensation awarded to her for the land actually taken, to shew which the Department of Railways must have produced their locating plan. Upon the 9th of April the Department of Railways telegraphed to Mr. Compton, an official arbitrator residing at Halifax, directing him to take the evidence in the plaintiffs case for submission to the full board; this telegram was supplemented by a written authority to Mr. Compton from the department, signed by the secretary, and dated the 17th of April, 1884, as follows:\nSir,\u2014With reference to the claim of Mrs. Widow Kearney, in the matter of the expropriation of certain land for the purposes of the Dartmouth Branch Railway, you are hereby instructed to take the evidence in the case, and submit the same to the full board of arbitrators for award upon the claim under the powers conferred by the act 31 Vic. ch. 12. I write this in confirmation of telegram sent you on the 9th instant.\nIn the meantime Mr. Compton, acting upon the authority of the telegram of the 9th of April, had given notice to the plaintiff's solicitor, and also to a gentlemen acting as counsel for the Dominion Government, that he would hold his court at the 17th of April to take the evidence. On that day the plaintiff and her solicitor and the counsel acting for the Dominion Government attended, and the court was opened by Mr. Compton. A surety was then offered by and on behalf of the plaintiff to sign with her the necessary bond as required by the 34th section of 31 Vic. ch. 12, and the 27th section of 44 Vic. ch. 25; the surety tendered not having been approved the case was adjourned to the following day, when plaintiff's solicitor attended and produced and tendered a bond duly executed in his presence by the plaintiff and a surety, and bearing date the 17th day of April, 1884. This bond was approved and accepted and was subject to the condition following:\nWhereas Maria Kearney of Dartmouth, N. S., hath preferred a certain claim against the Civil Government of Canada for a certain piece or parcel of land lying and being in the town of Dartmouth, in the county of Halifax, and Province of Nova Scotia, taken by the Government of Canada for the purposes of the Dartmouth Branch of the Intercolonial Railway. Whereas the claimant cannot agree with the Honorable Minister of Public Works of Canada, (acting in the capacity of representative of Our Sovereign Lady Victoria), with regard to the said claim, the same has been referred to the full board of official arbitrators of Canada, appointed under and by virtue of the act of the legislature of Canada, 31 Vic. ch. 12.\nAnd whereas by the said act it is expressly required that before any claim shall be arbitrated upon the claimant shall give security to Her Majesty to the satisfaction of the arbitrators, or any one of them, for the payment of the costs and expenses incurred by Her Majesty in the arbitration in the event of the costs on such arbitration, or any part thereof, being awarded against the said claimant, or of the award not exceeding the sum tendered by the said Minister to the said claimant.\nThe plaintiffs solicitor having then stated that he was not ready with his witnesses, and having applied to the official arbitrator for an adjournment, the case sat adjourned \"until such time as the arbitrator can conveniently resume it.\" In point of fact it never was resumed by the official arbitrators, nor was any reason suggested why it was not. The plaintiff and her solicitor perhaps thought, as is generally found to be the case, that a much larger sum is usually awarded after the work is completed than would be awarded, or than may be asked, if the arbitration should take place before the work is commenced. However, nothing further was done in the arbitration until after the 31st October, 1887, when, in pursuance of the provisions of the Dominion Statute, 50 & 51 Vic. ch. 16, the case was transferred to the Exchequer Court for adjudication by the judge of that court to whom was submitted all the evidence taken in the present action, and the result has been that, upon appeal to this court from the judgment of the learned judge of the Exchequer, the plaintiff has succeeded in recovering for the land the sum of $4,000 together with interest thereon from the 23rd of August, 1884, as already stated, for land for which she had expressed herself, in April, 1884, as willing to take $1000.\nIn the meantime the Department of Railways by the Minister of Railways, upon the 22nd of July, 1884, entered into a contract with the defendants for the construction of the railway, and after having, upon the 23rd day of August, 1884, caused a plan and a description of the land taken from the plaintiff to be duly registered in the registry office of the county of Halifax, authorized and directed the defendants afterwards, and on or about the 18th day of September, to enter upon the land of the plaintiff so taken and to do the several acts which they did, and for which this action was commenced upon the 30th of September, 1884.\nIt is unnecessary to set out the pleadings which display no small amount of prolixity and irrelevancy, for the whole substance of the case is that the action for an alleged wrongful entry upon the plaintiff's land, and for doing such acts as were done by the defendants between the 15th and 30th September in constructing the railway,\u2014to which action the defendants plead, first in justification, that the Minister of Railways had authority to enter upon and take the plaintiff's land for the construction of the Dartmouth branch of the Intercolonial Railway, and to do and to authorize to be done the acts complained of, and that the defendants, by the direction and command of, and as the agents and servants of, the Minister entered upon the land and there did the thing complained of; and secondly, that the defendants did what they did as the servants and employees of the Department of Railways, and that no notice in writing of this action was ever given to them as required by the 109th sec. of 44 Vic. ch. 25.\nThe case proceeded at the trial upon the contention, in which the learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia who tried the case concurred, that as it appeared that an order in council authorising the construction of the Dartmouth branch was not made until the 12th December, 1884, none of the acts authorized by the Minister prior to that date were legal, and he rendered a verdict for the plaintiff for $100. Upon appeal from that judgment the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversed it and ordered judgment to be entered for the defendants upon the ground that they were entitled to have had, but had not, notice of action. From this judgment the present appeal is taken.\nThe Minister of Railways certainly appears to have received the impression or formed the opinion that in November, 1884, an order in council was necessary, but in this opinion or impression I think he was mistaken. Both he and his advisers seem to me to have lost sight altogether of 35 Vic. ch. 24 and 46 Vic. ch. 2, and also to have misconceived the object and the effect of the 6th sec. of 44 Vic. ch. 25.\nIt cannot, I apprehend, admit of a doubt that the 6th sec. of 44 Vic. ch. 25 did not effect a repeal of 35 Vic. ch. 24; neither can it be doubted that if this 6th section had never been enacted the Minister would have had complete authority to construct the Dartmouth branch as a public work of the Dominion of Canada under the powers vested in him by 35 Vic. ch. 24, in connection with 46 Vic. ch. 2, and that for such purposes all the provisions of 44 Vic. ch. 25, as well as 31 Vic. ch. 12, would apply in maintenance and support of the acts of the Minister Now, the object and effect of the 6th sec. of 44 Vic ch. 25, seems to me to be this: It authorises the Minister of Railways, without any order in council or any other authority whatever, to construct a branch line of the Intercolonial Railway, provided such branch should not exceed one mile, and it makes applicable to the construction of such a branch all the provisions applicable to the acquiring the necessary land and to the complete construction of the work. Now if the Dartmouth branch railway had not exceeded one mile in length the Minister could have constructed it upon his own responsibility without the assistance of any previous appropriation by Parliament for the purpose such as was granted by 46 Vic. ch. 2; and if a sum of money had been appropriated for such a branch by a Parliamentary grant the Minister would have that appropriation as an additional authority under the powers vested in him by 35 Vic. ch. 24, as justifying him in all his acts for the purpose of constructing such a branch. But the section 6 further provides that the Minister may, by and with the authority of the Governor in council, and without any other authority, construct a branch railway not exceeding six miles in length, and this authority may be exercised without any previous appropriation of any sum by Parliament for such a branch. This is a power given to the Governor in council ex mero motu, to construct a branch in connection with a Government railway without any previous appropriation for the purpose or any other Parliamentary sanction whatever. But the vesting such a special authority in the Governor in council does not detract one iota from the authority vested in the Minister by 35 Vic. ch. 24, when an appropriation is made by an act of Parliament for the construction of a branch line between two places whether they be or be not more than six miles apart from each other. The 46 Vic. ch. 2 shows that the Dartmouth branch of the Intercolonial Railway was a line known to Parliament. It required no order in council to bring it into existence.\nBy 44 Vic. ch. 25, it is enacted that all the provisions of that act shall apply to all railways vested in Her Majesty, and that are under the control and management of the Minister of Railways. The word \"railway\" as used in the act is declared to mean every railway and property connected therewith under the management of the department.\nBy 37 Vic. ch. 15 the Intercolonial Railway, with all property thereunto appertaining, is expressly declared to be a public work vested in Her Majesty and under the control and management of the Minister.\nBy 35 Vic. ch. 24 every railway for the construction of which any public money shall be appropriated by parliament is declared to be a railway and public work under the control and management of the Minister.\nUpon the passing, therefore, of 46th Vic. ch. 2 the Branch of the Intercolonial Railway to Dartmouth became a railway vested in Her Majesty and under the control and management of the Minister, to which all the sections of 44 Vic. ch. 25, relative to the acquiring title to lands for the purposes of the railway, as well as all the like sections of 31 Vic. ch. 12, are made applicable wholly apart from and independently of anything in the 6th section of 44 Vic. ch. 25. I am of opinion, therefore, that for the protection and justification of the Minister, in doing and authorising to be done every thing that was necessary for the construction of the Dartmouth Branch Railway, an order in council under the said 6th section was not necessary; and that upon registration in August, 1884, of the plan and description of the plaintiff's land, which was required for that purpose, that land became vested in Her Majesty for the use of the Dominion Government under section 10 of 44 Vic. ch. 25, and the plaintiff's rights were converted into a claim for compensation, the proceedings to obtain which it was quite competent for the plaintiff herself to have initiated under the 27th section of the act, which she might have done at any time and no doubt would have done if she or her advisers had not formed the opinion, in which they have been justified by the result, that it would be to her advantage to delay proceedings towards arbitration until after the work should be completed. I am of opinion, therefore, that it clearly appeared that the acts of the defendants under the authority of the Minister were justified, and that for this reason the verdict should have been for the defendants. But I am also of opinion that the defendants were entitled to notice of action. If the Minister was authorised in causing the acts complained of to be done, the defendants were justified as acting by his command and as his servants. If the Minister was not justified he was himself equally responsible as the defendants for the acts of the defendants, and he would have been entitled to notice of action, and as the defendants acted under the authority of the Department of Railways and the Minister and employed by them to do what they did, as they would be justified as the servants and employees of the department if the Minister had been justified, so are they equally the servants and employees of the department and the Minister if the Minister was not justified and equally with him entitled to notice. He who does a thing by the command and authority of another, and employed by such other, is surely, as regards the act authorized, both in law and common sense, rightly described as the servant and employee of the person employing him.\nI am of opinion, therefore, for the above reasons, that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The plaintiff brought this action on the 30th September, 1884, charging the defendants with trespassing on her lands, and claiming $8,000 damages. The pleadings, which do not err on the side of needless brevity, need not be noticed in detail.\nThe defendants, by indenture dated the 22nd day of July, 1884, entered into a contract with Her Majesty Queen Victoria, represented by the Minister of Railways and Canals of Canada, to construct a railway of five or six miles, being a branch of the Intercolonial Railway, the work to bo completed to a named point on or before the 15th September, 1884, or if extended the whole contemplated distance then to be completed on or before the 1st November, 1884.\nThis branch railway was a work which the Minister of Railways and Canals was authorized by the 6th section of the Government Railways Act, 1881, to construct, but only by and with the authority of the Governor in Council. The order in council was essential whenever such a branch railway exceeded one mile in length.\nAn order in council was passed, but not until the 12th December, 1884, which was after the contract time for the completion of the whole work and after the commencement of this action.\nThe entry upon the lands of the plaintiff of which she complains was made in September, 1884.\nThe action was tried in 1886, before the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia, who gave judgment for the plaintiff with $100 damages.\nThe defendants moved against that judgment, and it was reversed by a majority of the court on the ground that the defendants were entitled, under section 109 of the statute of 1881, (44 Vic. ch. 25), to a notice of action which had not been given. Two of he learned judges of the court held that opinion, the learned Chief Justice dissenting.\nSection 109 is thus expressed:\nNo action shall be brought against any officer, employee or servant of the Department for anything done by virtue of his office, service or employment unless within three months after the act committed, and upon one month's previous notice thereof in writing, and the action shall be tried in the county or judicial district where the cause of action arose.\nThe question was whether these contractors were employees of the Department of Railways and Canals within the intention of the enactment.\nThe dispute is over the word \"employee\" which has of late years found a place in our popular vocabulary, and has now been adopted in Dominion legislation.\nIn the absence of any definition in the interpretation clause of the statute we have to find what the word means.\nSeveral dictionaries have been quoted from in the judgments delivered in the court below. In those of them within my reach I do not find the word \"employee,\" but I find the French term \"employ\u00e9,\" in the masculine form, inserted as a word that retains in English speech its French meaning of one who is employed.\nThat is doubtless the term intended by the legislature.\nIn fact we find the two expressions used convertibly, as e. g. in section 112 \"any officer or servant of, or any person employed by the department,\" and in section 121 \"any officer or servant of, or person in the employ of the department,\" obviously denoting the same persons described in sections 64, 74, 82, 106 and 109, as officer, servant or employee of the department.\nThe word as used in the statute means, in my opinion, \"servant\" and nothing more. It is, perhaps, inserted to save the feelings of those servants who do not like to be called servants, or by way of concession to the tendency of the day to understand the word servant as expressive only of service of a lower or quasi menial grade. Section 120 illustrates this. It provides for the \"punishment of every person wilfully obstructing any officer or employee in the execution of his duty,\" obviously including under the term \"employee,\" persons who might be called servants without fear of resentment on their part\u2014switchmen for example\u2014and proving that words \"employee or servant\" are used to denote one class and not two classes of retainers.\nThus the statute is its own interpreter. The \"employee or servant of the department\" is not a contractor like these defendants who agree with Her Majesty to provide materials and labor, and to execute such works as the construction of a branch railway. There is not often occasion to speak of contractors in the Railway Act, but the term does occur once or twice. In section 104 the contractor is called \"contractor\" in provisions relating to his contract, and section 99 provides for attesting on oath accounts sent in by \"any contractor, or person in the employ of the department,\" distinguishing between contractor and employee.\nThen we have section 121 giving to the informer a moiety of pecuniary penalties imposed by the act, \"unless he be an officer or servant of, or person in the employ of, the department,\" where the persons in the employ, or employees, must mean those regularly employed about the railway. A better definition, and one which effectually excludes contractors, is supplied by sections 112 and 113, viz: persons employed at regular wages. Section 112 makes a misdemeanor of the wilful contravention of any rule, order or regulation of the department by \"any officer or servant of, or any person employed by, the department,\" if injury ensues to property or person; while, if the contravention does not cause injury, then, by section 113, \"the officer, servant or other person guilty thereof shall thereby incur a penalty not exceeding the amount of thirty days' pay,\" etc.\nIt is, to my mind, manifest from the light thrown by the statute itself upon the sense in which the word \"employee\" is used that the view of the learned Chief Justice in the court below is correct, and that the protection of section 109 is not intended to extend to persons in the position of the present defendants.\nI should have arrived at the same conclusion if section 109 had been the only place in the statute where the expression in debate was found. It would, in my judgment, be impossible on the one hand to extend the meaning of the term \"employee,\" so as to include contractors, even if they were nominally contractors with the department in place of being contractors with the Queen, and on the other hand to narrow the force of the term so as to exclude the liability of the employer for injuries caused by the negligence of the employed. It is now familiar law that a person employing a contractor is not usually liable for injuries caused by his negligence. The cases on the subject will be found collected, and discussed in a pleasant style, in Shirley's Leading Cases,[12], under Reedie v. London and N. Y. Railway Company[13] And see Evans on Principal and Agent[14].\nI have no idea that the ordinary rule on the subject is to be reversed when Government railways are concerned, but that would, as I apprehend, be the result of the judgment now in review. If the contractor is an employee or servant then the master is liable for injuries caused by his negligence or want of skill.\nI do not think we derive assistance in finding the force of the terms \"employee or servant,\" as used in our section 109, from the decisions under section 139 of the English Public Health Act, 1848, or section 106 of the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 25 & 26 Vic. ch. 102. The former act requires notice of action before process is sued out against any superintending inspector, or any officer or person acting in his aid or under the direction of the General Board of Health, or against the Local Board of Health or any member thereof, or the officer of health, clerk, surveyor, inspector of nuisances, or other officer or person whomsoever acting under the direction of the Local Board of Health. A person who agreed to sink wells under a contract with a local board which contained provisions found in most contracts of the kind, and found in the contract of the present defendant with Her Majesty, that the work should be done to the satisfaction of the surveyor of the board who had power to require the contractor to reject and remove materials, &c., and to discharge foremen or workmen with whom the surveyor might be dissatisfied, was held in Newton v. Ellis[15] to be a person acting under the direction of the board, and therefore entitled to notice of action. That decision was followed by others, both under the Public Health Act, 1848, and under the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, section 106 of which is essentially the same as section 139 of the earlier act, but includes \"contractor\" among the persons enumerated as entitled to notice. (See Davis v. Curling[16], Hardwick v. Moss[17], Poulsum v. Thirst[18], Wilson v. Mayor of Halifax[19], Whatman v. Pearson)[20].\nThese enactments differ so materially from our section 109, which extends its protection only to \"any officer, employee or servant of the department,\" as to leave them without influence on the controversy except as they tend to show that my understanding of the effect of section 109 correctly interprets the intention of the legislature; because, with the two English statutes before them, one of which was held by force of the words \"acting under the direction of the board,\" to include a contractor under the ordinary form of contract, and in the other of which the contractor was expressly named, notwithstanding the presence of the words \"acting under their or any of their directions,\" the legislature has not adopted the same or, in my judgment, any equivalent phraseology. We must, as it seems to me, interpret our statute by itself, and, for the reasons I have endeavored to explain, I am unable to hold that this defendant is, within the meaning of section 109, an officer, employee or servant of the department.\nIt has been contended that the acts of the defendants were legally authorised. That contention was unsuccessfully advanced at the trial before the learned Chief Justice, and was dealt with in the judgment then delivered by him. Before the court in banc the judgments turned altogether on the objection to the want of notice of action, and no opinion is reported to have been expressed on the other grounds of defence.\nThe points have been ingeniously argued before us by Mr. Borden for the defendants, but without creating in my mind any doubt of the soundness of the judgment which decided them against his clients\nThe fundamental difficulty in his way is the absence of legal authority to enter on the lands of the plaintiff in September, 1884.\nOne answer, suggested rather than seriously argued, is that an order in council was passed after action commenced which professed to ratify what had been done.\nNo authority has been produced which supports the contention. The order in council, which under the Government Railway Act 1881, section 6, might have been issued to authorise the construction of this branch railway, would have taken the place of an act of Parliament. The Governor in Council would have, in making such an order, been exercising a power vested in him by the legislature.\nThe order made in December, 1884, could operate only from its date. It was not like the ratification of something done in the name or professedly on behalf of another. It is too plain to require elaborate demonstration thatt he act which can be effectually ratified so as to affect the rights of a stranger must be one which the person who ratifies it could himself have lawfully done. The prior mandate to which the ratification is equivalent must be a mandate that could lawfully have been issued.\nIt was argued that the Minister of Railways and Canals had power to enter or authorise the defendants to enter upon this land without an order in council by virtue of certain powers given to the Minister of Public Works by 31 Vic. ch. 12, and which it is said have been transmitted to the Department of Railways and Canals. Works constructed at the expense of Canada are, by section 10, vested in Her Majesty. The Minister is empowered, by section 24, to acquire and take possession of in the name of Her Majesty any land necessary in his judgment for the construction or maintenance of any public work, and if the owner refuses or fails to agree for conveying the land the Minister may, by section 27, tender the reasonable value in his estimation, with a notice to arbitrate, and may after three days authorise possession to be taken.\nWithout stopping to discuss the question whether these provisions are now applicable to railways which are the subject of separate legislation, we notice that the minor premiss in each syllogism is not proved. It is not proved that this land was the property of Her Majesty under section 10. There was, in 1883, included in the estimates an item of $110,000 for a branch of the Intercolonial Railway to Dartmouth, but the grant was contingent on action to be taken by the municipality of Dartmouth. I do not know that such action was taken, and it is clear enough that the plaintiff's land had not been bought from her at the expense of Canada, or from any other source, when she brought this action. If there was any right of entry under the Public Works Act it must have been under section 27. But here the minor premiss is that there was a public work for which the land was wanted, and we are brought back to the absence of the order in council by which alone the Dartmouth branch became known to the law, but months had to elapse before such an order existed.\nAn argument has been pressed for the defendants founded on steps that were taken towards arbitration, and another is rested on the filing of a plan and description. Let us note together the facts touching these two matters.\nA notice to arbitrate was given to the plaintiff on the 4th of April, 1884. These dates are material. It described the land proposed to be taken, and for which $150 was offered, as running all across the plaintiff's lot at the uniform distance of twenty feet on each side of a line marked on a plan filed in the office of the Chief Engineer at Moncton as the centre line of the railway. There were either one or two meetings of the arbitrators. The plaintiff attended, and she executed the bond required by the statute. The last meeting was on the 18th of April, when the arbitration was adjourned, and it was never resumed.\nIt is provided by the Government Railways Act, 1881, section 10, that\nLands taken for the use of Government railways shall be laid off by metes and bounds; and where no proper deed or conveyance thereof to the crown is made and executed by the person having the power to make such deed or conveyance, or where a person interested in such lands is incapable of making such deed or conveyance, or where for any other reason the Minister shall deem it advisable so to do, a plan and description of such lands signed by the Minister, his Deputy or Secretary, or by the Superintendent or by an Engineer of the Department, or by a land surveyor duly licensed and sworn in and for the province in which the lands are situate, shall be deposited of record in the office of the registry of deeds for the country or registration division in which the lands are situate, and such lands by such deposit shall thereupon become and remain vested in the crown.\nNo part of the plaintiff's land was laid off by metes and bounds. There were stakes planted by the engineers, but they were merely to show the centre line of the railway.\nThe plan referred to in the notice to arbitrate was never deposited of record in the office of the registry of deeds, but another plan with a different description was prepared, omitting part of the land covered by the first description and including some land which the first description did not include. That plan was deposited in the registry office on the 13th of August, 1884, and the entry on the land was in September. It is admitted that the second description included the locus in quo.\nIt is argued that the effect of the deposit of the plan was, under section 10, to vest the lands in the crown, making the entry lawful and confirming the right of the plaintiff to her claim for compensation. I am inclined to think that that would be so if the section had been fully complied with, but I have not examined the statute closely enough to speak more decidedly on the point. It seems clear, however, that the plan and description must be of territory laid off by metes and bounds. It is upon \"such lands\" that the statutory conveyance operates, and the essential work on the ground is here wanting. The point made respecting the attempt at arbitration is that the plaintiff is estopped by her conduct from disputing the right of the crown to enter.\nI confess my inability to perceive any particular in which the doctrine of estoppel has any application to the facts, but the change from the plot of land respecting which the tender was made and the arbitration initiated, to the different, or partly different, plot to which the dispute now relates, puts all question of the arbitration out of sight.\nIn a case very recently decided by the Court of Appeal, in re Uxbridge and Rickmansworth Railway Co.[21], there are some observations made by Lord Justice Cotton which are not inapplicable to one or two phases of the case before us. The private act of the Railway Company there required the subscription of a certain amount of capital before the company was authorised to exercise its compulsory powers; in our case the order in council was necessary.\nThe capital there had not been subscribed, as here the order in council was not passed.\nNevertheless treaties had gone on with landowners not unlike what occurred with the present plaintiff.\nThe direct question to which the observations of the Lord Justice were addressed was whether or not the compulsory powers of the company had been exercised. Incidentally he had to touch upon the effect of the failure in the preliminary requisite of the subscription of capital, a question similar to that respecting the obligation of a railway company to file plans and surveys before exercising any statutory powers, on which the decision to a great extent turned in Corporation of Parkdale v. West,[22]. The report of the Uxbridge Railway case is very long. The observations to which I refer are the following, and will be found at p. 563; Then has there been an exercise of the compulsory powers? In my opinion there has not. It is very true the power to give notice to treat is included in that group of sections, in the Lands Clauses Act, headed \"and with respect to the purchase and taking of lands otherwise than by agreement, be it enacted as follows: \"Then there follows a direction that the promoters of the undertaking shall give a notice to treat in respect of the lands they require to take. But although the direction to give notice to treat is included within that group of clauses, there may never be any step taken as regards the exercise of compulsory powers: because if the company have not got their capital subscribed they cannot exercise any compulsory powers, and the notice to treat, as was the case in one instance here, may be merely a step taken towards an agreement with the landowner, in order to ascertain whether he is willing to make the contract with the railway company, the company saying: 'I want the land; will you sell it to us?' In my opinion it cannot be said that that alone is an exercise of compulsory powers. We are not deciding this for the first time, because it was decided in 1870, in Guest v. Poole and Bournemouth Railway Company[23], that notice to treat was not an exercise of compulsory powers. It was said that that was not necessary to the decision of the case\u2014that the actual decision was only that the company could not give the notice; but all the judges (and they were judges of considerable authority), in their judgments say that giving the notice was not an exercise of compulsory powers. And in the events which have happened here service of the notice to treat is shown not tu have been an exercise of the compulsory powers. It is very true it is a step towards the exercise of the compulsory powers; that is to say, the compulsory powers as regards the purchase of land cannot be exercised until the notice to treat has been given; but they cannot be exercised unless the capital has been subscribed. Subscribing the capital is not an exercise of the compulsory powers, although it is a necessary step towards the exercise of those powers; and in the same way a notice to treat is not an exercise of the compulsory powers, though it is a step that must be taken before the compulsory powers can be exercised and put in force.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: T.

Sweeny v. The Bank of Montreal (12 Can. S.C.R. 661; 12 App. Cases 617) referred to and followed. Taschereau J. dessenting.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side) (1) affirming a judgment of the Superior Court dismissing the appellant's action with costs.\nThis was an action brought by the appellant, as tutor of the minor child, issue of the marriage of Patrick Thomas Gibb and the late Helen Raphael, to recover certain stock of the Major Manufacturing Company, held by Patrick Thomas Gibb in trust for the minor and transferred, in breach of his trust to respondent.\nFrom 1879 to first February 1884 Patrick Thomas Gibb and Edward J. Major were partners in the firm of Major & Gibb. Gibb married Miss Helen Raphael in January, 1880, after executing a marriage contract, of record by which he made over to her and her heirs inter alia, a gift of ten thousand dollars, household furniture, and all the moneys coming to him as one of the residuary legatees of the Estate of the late Beniah Gibb: Gibb received from this Estate subsequent to his marriage various sums of money at different times. In November, 1880, Helen Raphael died intestate, leaving the minor child Helen Raphael Gibb her sole heir-at-law. In the books of the firm of Major & Gibb a portion of the money therein invested ($1,315.67) was credited to Estate Gibb the rest appears to have been included in a different account. This did not include the money that Gibb had received from the Beniah Gibb Estate subsequent to his marriage.\nIn February, 1884, the business of Major & Gibb was merged into a joint stock company, under the name of the Major Manufacturing Company, the partners in the former Company, for their capital, receiving an equivalent in shares of the Major Manufacturing Company. To effect this the defendant Gibb subscribed for three allotments of stock:\n1st. Thirteen shares in his name \"in trust, representing $1,300.00.\n2nd. Twenty-four shares in his own name representing $2,400.00.\n3rd. Three shares in his own name, representing $300.00. The thirteen shares were distinctly subscribed for in trust. It was not made clear that the additional shares were subscribed for in trust but subsequent to the subscription the words in trust appeared appended to the name.\nIn the ledger of the Major Manufacturing Company, this stock was credited at the formation of the Company in two accounts: P. T. Gibb in trust, $2,700.00; and Estate Gibb. $ 300.00.\nRespondent was appointed Managing Director of the Company, which position he held from its formation till after the transfers.\nOn the 20th February 1885 Gibb transferred three shares of this stock to respondent and on the 16th March 1885 he transferred to respondent the remaining thirty-seven shares, as follows: THE MAJOR MANUFACTURING!- CO., (Limited).\nTransfer No. 6.\nFor value received from James McFarlane, I, P. T. Gibb, of Montreal, do hereby assign and transfer unto the said James McFarlane, three shares, amounting to the sum of three hundred dollars in the capital stock of the Major Manufacturing Company (Limited), subject to the rules and regulations of the said Company;\nWitness my hand, at the Company's Office this twentieth day of February, eighteen hundred and eighty-five.\nWitness: (Signed) P. Thos. Gibb, in trust. (Signed) C. F. Bingham.\nI do hereby accept the foregoing transfer, this 20th day of February, 1885.\nWitness : (Signed) James McFaRlane.\n(Signed) C. F. Bingham.\nTHE MAJOR MANUFACTURING CO. (Limited.)\nTransfer No. 7.\nFor value received from James McFarlane,I,P. Thos. Gibb of Montreal, do hereby assign and transfer unto the said James McFarlane, thirty-seven shares, amounting to the sum of three thousand seven hundred dollars, in the capital stock of the Major Manufacturing Company (Limited), subject to the rules and regulations of the said Company.\nWitness my hand, at the Company's Office, this 16th day of March, 1885.\nWitness: (Signed) P. Thos. Gibb, in trust. (Signed) C. F. Bingham..\nI do hereby accept the foregoing transfer this 16th day of March, 1885.\nWitness : (Signed) James McFarlane.\n(Signed) C. F. Bingham.\nThe words in trust in the foregoing transfers were added by P. T. Gibb in answer to the following letter written by Mr. Macfarlane to Mr. Gibb. : \u2014\nMontreal, March 23rd, 1885.\nTo Mr. P. T. GIBB,\nCare 646 Craig Street.\nDear SIR,\nWe beg to call your attention to the fact that your transfers of forty shares of this Company's Capital Stock recently made to James McFarlane, are slightly irregular, and in your interest it is well that you should call at as early an hour as convenient and make the necessary corrections to same.\nYours truly,\nThe Major Manufacturing Company\n(Signed). JAMES McFARLANE,\nMan. Dir.\nThere was evidence given at the trial that the respondent Vice-President and Manager of the Major Manufacturing Company inspected the books, and that he was aware that P.T. Gibb held the shares in trust for his child and that the words \"in trust\" in 2nd and 3rd allotments of stock had been added subsequently by Gibb, in order to protect the interest of his minor child.\nDAVIDSON, Q.C., $ MacLellan for the appellants.\nGEOFFRION Q. C., and Smith for the respondents.\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C. J.-It is clear that under art. 297, C.C., a' tutor without authorization of the judge or prothonotary, granted on the advice of a family council is not allowed to alienate or hypothecate the immoveable property of a minor, nor is he allowed to make over or transfer any capital sum belonging to the minor or his share and interest in any financial commercial or manufacturing joint stock company. See also arts. 298 and 299 C. C.\nThe sale or transfer in this case was made without any such authorization. This brings the matter down. to the simple question : Were the shares or any of them the property of the minor ? I think there can be no doubt that the thirteen shares subscribed \" in trust \" were the property of the minor held by her tutor in trust for her. Although the words \"in trust \" were not added at the time of the subscription of the 37 shares, they were subsequently added in the books of the company, and stood, at the time of the transfer to defendants in such books in the name of Patrick Thomas Gibb in trust. The transfer of the 16th of March, appears to have been made to plaintiff by the signature of Gibb without the addition of these words. On the 23rd, the defendant discovering this irregularity and necessarily knowing from the books and his position in the company that the shares were not held by Gibb in his own name, but in trust, addressed the following letter to Gibb : \u2014\nMontreal, 23rd March, 1885.\nTo Mr. P. T. Gibb,\nCare 646 Graig Street.\nDear SIR,\u2014We beg to call your attention to the fact that your transfers of forty shares of this company's capital stock, recently made to James McFarlane, are slightly irregular, and in your interest, it is well that you should call at as early an hour as convenient and make the necessary corrections to same.\nYours truly,\nThE Major Manufacturing Co.\n(Signed) James McFarlane.\nMan. Dir.\nand the words \" in trust\" were accordingly added.\nI think it is sufficiently clear that the amount of these shares was received by Gibb as part of the property belonging to the minor, and if it was, his adding the words\" in trust \"in the books of the company was just what he should have done for it would have been most unjust that the property of the minor should have been taken by him to meet his individual liability.\nInasmuch, then, as I think it was sufficiently shown that this stock represented the property of the minor and was held by Gibb in trust for her and that the defendants took the transfer of it with knowledge that it was not held by Gibb as his own property but \" in trust,\" therefore the transfer was void and the defendant must account for the shares to the plaintiff the present tutor. I cannot distinguish this case from that of Sweeny v. The Bank of Montreal (1) decided in this court, and subsequently approved by the Privy Council (1).\nI therefore think the appeal should be allowed.\nFOURNLER J.-The present appellant (plaintiff in the court below) in his capacity of tutor to Helen Raphael Gibb daughter of Patrick Thomas Gibb, one of the defendants in the court of first instance, brought an action against the respondent and the said Patrick Thomas Gibb for a decree to set aside and annul a transfer, made by the said defendant Patrick Thomas Gibb, to said respondent, Macfarlane, of forty shares in the capital stock of the joint stock company known as the \" Major Manufacturing Company,\" and obtain the said shares for the said minor.\nIn January 1880 Patrick Thomas Gibb married Helen Raphael, and by his contract of marriage he made over to her and her heirs inter alia a grift of ten thousand dollars household furniture and all moneys coming to him as one of the residuary legatees of the estate of the late Beniah Gibb.\nAt the time of his marriage he received certain moneys from his wife which he invested in the partnership firm of Major & Gibb, composed of himself and Edward J. Major. Subsequent to his marriage he received certain other sums from the estate Beniah Gibb, as is evidenced by the receipts signed by him, and to be found in the case at pp. 76, 78 and 80 and which moneys were also invested in the firm of Major & Gibb.\nIn November, 1880, Helen Raphael died intestate, leaving the minor child, Helen Raphael Gibb, her sole heir-at-law.\nIn the books of the firm of Major & Gibb, a portion of the money therein invested ($1315.67) was credited to Estate Gibb. This did not include the money Gibb had received from the Estate Beniah Gibb subsequent to his marriage.\nAfter his wife's death Gibb did not take any steps to have a tutor appointed to his minor child or to have an inventory made of his late wife's estate.\nIn February, 1884, the business of Major & Gibb was amalgamated with the business of the respondent, and formed into a joint stock company under the name of the Major Manufacturing Company, the partners of the old firm receiving an equivalent in stock for their capital. To effect this Gibb subscribed for three allotments of stock. 1st. Thirteen shares in his own name \u201cin trust\u201d, representing $1,300.\n2nd. Twenty-four shares in his own name representing $2,400.\n3rd. Three shares in his own name representing $300.\nThe thirteen shares were subscribed for \"in trust\" The subscription list and books of the company show that the twenty-four shares were also held \" in trust,\" but whether the words \"in trust\" were added on subscribing or at a subsequent date is not very clearly proved. The subscription for the three shares never had the words \"in trust\" appended.\nBut in the ledger book of the company this stock was credited at the formation of the company in two accounts, \" P. T. Gibb, in trust, $2,700,\" and \" Estate Gibb, $1,300.\"\nOn the 20th February, 1885, one year after the respondent had commenced to act as Managing Director, Gibb transferred three shares of this stock to respondent and on the 16th March 1885, he transferred to respondent the remaining thirty-seven shares. Appellant contends that the shares which he claims by his action are the property of his pupil, and that they were held \"in trust\" for her by her father, who had no right or authority to sell the said shares, and that the sale of these shares was fraudulent and collusive\nThe respondent alone contested the action, alleging in his pleas that the stock was acquired by him in good faith, that no trust attached to the stock, that the words \"in trust\" were added by Gibb to the subscription list after the allotment of the stock for the purpose of preventing Gribb's creditors from attaching the stock as private stock, and that Gibb was the sole and absolute owner of the shares. The appellant in answer to respondent's pleas said that the stock was always held \" in trust\" and that the shares were so entered in the Company's books, and in the books of the firm of Major & Gibb; that it was known to respondent that Gibb was not the owner, and that Gribb had no power or authority to sell the stock. Respondent filed no answer or replication to appellant's answers to pleas.\nThere is evidence that in her lifetime Mrs. Gibb loaned to her husband the sum of $1315.77 which sum was credited to her in the books of the firm of Major & Gibb. Upon her death, there being no will, the property in that account belonged to her child, and it was credited in consequence in the books to \"Estate Gibb.\" This same amount, less $15.67, was carried forward into the books of the Major Manufacturing Company. It is clear, therefore, that it was with these moneys that Gibb subscribed for the first thirteen shares, amounting to $1,300, moneys which he had received from his wife and which belonged to his child. The twenty-seven shares were also subscribed for with moneys received from the estate of Beniah Gibb, and these moneys having been transferred to Helen Raphael by Gibb's marriage contract, they became the property of the minor, the sole heir of Mrs. Helen Raphael Gibb. Having no right or property in the moneys, he invested them in this way for the benefit of his child. It is true he was not regularly appointed tutor to his daughter, but his management of the business of the minor assimilates his position to that of a quasi-tutor, or least to that of a negotiorum gestor (1). He had sufficient control over these moneys to administer and take charge of them and invest them in such a way as not to mix them with his own private funds. By placing them \u201cin trust\" without disclosing the name of his cestui que trust, he nevertheless gave positive notice to all persons interested that these shares were not his property. He, himself, states in his evidence that he did so in order to protect the interest of his minor child. The statute authorizing \"trusts\" does not enact any special form in which it should be written in order to create a trust it is sufficient that the intention of creating a trust is made manifest and clear. Upon this point of the case there can be no doubt, for we have the positive statement made by Gibb that he added the words \"in trust \" because knowing he had private debts, he wanted these moneys to be free from seizure, as a portion of them did not belong to him. As to the portion belonging to the minor (and she was the real owner of the greater portion), nobody can reproach Gibb for having done his duty by placing them \"in trust,\" for his object in doing so was both legal and honest. There can be no doubt, therefore, that his intention was clearly to create a trust, for of the three subscriptions he made, there is only one in his name without the addition of the words \u201cin trust\u201d and in the transfer he made, he gave notice that they were all held \"in trust.\" When. therefore he added the words \" in trust\" as he did when he subscribed for the thirteen shares ($1,300), it is clear he wanted to create at trust,\" and by doing so, he did not in any way alter his mode of dealing with these moneys which belonged to his child and formed part of his mothers estate; he thereby publicly made known the quality and capacity in which he had always held the shares. He was simply a trustee * that is what is meant by the words \" in trust.\" Taylor v. Benham (1):\nThe ordinary sense of the term \" in trust \" is descriptive of a fiduciaries or technical trust; and this sense ousrnt to be retained until the other sense is cleary established to be that intended by the testator. Every person who receives money to be paid to another, or to be applied to a particular purpose to which he does not apply it, is a trustel\nIn King v. Mitchell (1), Mr. Justice Story said:_\nThe ordinary sense of the term \" in trust \" is descriptive of a fiduciary estate or technical trust\nThe fact that Gibb represented his child's interests in the Major Manufacturing Company clearly appeared by the entries in the company's books, for it described his interest as follows: \" P. T. Gibb in trust \" and \" Estate Gibb,\" and by the general knowledge that the directors and officers of the company had that the trust was for his child or his wife's estate, as Mr. Charles Bingham positively swears in his deposition.\nGibb did not contract in his own personal name for these shares with the company, but as representing the minor, and that with the knowledge of the respondent and therefore the contract which was executed was one between the company and the representative of the minor. This investment of the minor's moneys made with notice to the respondent could not be displaced. Gibb had no doubt the power and authority to act on her behalf in getting the stock, but once he had it he could no longer deal with it as he pleased, but he lost control of it and became immediately subject to the \"provisions contained in articles 297 and 298 of the Civil Code, which prevent a tutor from making or transferring any shares belonging to minor in any joint stock company without the authority of a judge or prothonotary.\nNot only is the transfer null as being in direct contravention with the terms of article 297 of our Code, but also because the respondent knew perfectly well that the shares in question did not belong to Gibb, that they were the absolute property of his minor child, they having been secured with moneys belonging to her mother, and for which moneys Mrs. Raphael Gibb had been credited in the books of the firm of Major & Gibb. As to the shares amounting to $2,700\u2014they also being credited to the minor under the entry of \" P. T. Gibb in trust,\"\u2014it is clearly and positively proved that respondent had full knowledge of the fact that this entry was made in those books in order to show that they belonged to the minor. Respondent had, prior to the formation of the Major Manufacturing Company, closely examined the accounts of the partnership firm of Major & Gibb. He had also on several occasions looked into the account books and examined the financial standing of the Major Manufacturing Company, of which he was vice-president and managing director. Not only was he in a position to ascertain to whom the shares belonged, but there is abundant evidence that he had personal knowledge of the fact that they belonged to the minor child of P. T. Gibb, and had been subscribed for With her moneys. With the full knowledge of this fact he could not be ignorant of the provisions of the law which prohibit the transfer or alienation of shares belonging to a minor without the previous authorization of a judge, and therefore that the transfer he obtained without complying with this formality was absolutely null and void.\nI do not think it is necessary for me to give here extracts from the evidence to show that respondent was well aware of the minor's rights and interests in these shares for it is uncontroverted and positive. But there is one fact of record which dispels any doubt which might arise on this question, it is that respondent, having got a transfer of these shares signed by Gibb in his own name, without the words \"in trust,\" got Gibb, on the 23rd March, 1885, to add the words \" in trust \" in order to show that it was trust property he was alienating. How can he now contend for a moment that these shares were not shares in trust ? It would be acting in bad faith and claiming contrary to his own title.\nIt is evident that having full knowledge that the shares were the minor\u2019s property, he should not have accepted a transfer of them unless Gibb had previously got authority from a judge to sell them. In any event there was sufficient to show by the words \"in trust\" that Gibb's title was not absolute and it was for respondent to inquire whether he had authority to sell as it was decided by this court in the case of Sweeny v. Bank of Montreal. (1)\nNotwithstanding the contrary opinion which has been expressed, I think the principles of law applicable to the facts of this case are the principles of law which we thought should be applied in the case Sweeny v. The Bank of Montreal (1).\nIt has been attempted to distinguish the two cases by stating that in the Sweeny case the cestui que trust had approved of and accepted the investment made of the moneys whilst the minor in this case could not accept the investment. The plea of minority cannot avail the respondent. It is true, that Gibb, the father of the minor child, was not her tutor; but the evidence clearly establishes the fact that he had assumed the functions of tutor and had during the whole of this transaction acted for and on behaf of his minor child. In such a case the law imposes on the party who assumes the functions of a tutor, the same responsibility as if he were duly appointed. He is what we call a quasi-tutor or protutor. Having acted as such and done an act to which the law imposes the same responsibilities as if it had been done by a tutor, he cannot afterwards act otherwise than as a tutor would, i. e., it is impossible for him to dispose of these shares once acquired otherwise than by conforming to the formalities imposed on a tutor by articles 297-298, Civil Code.\nIn any case Gibb acted as the negotiorum gestor of his minor child, and by Art. 1043 C.C. he is responsible for his administration. It is true that at her majority the child might repudiate the investment and make her father responsible for any loss the investment might cause to her. But until then there is a subsisting contract which must have its whole effect.\nThese formalities not having been complied with the sale and transfer of these shares is null, and the appellant should be condemned to pay their value to the appellant in his capacity of tutor.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. There is no trust whatever disclosed by the evidence in this case, and I fully agree in the finding of the two courts below on that question of fact. As to the three shares, there is no room for controversy. They were subscribed for, and always remained in Gibbs own name. The twenty-four shares were also only subscribed for in Gibb's own name. Subsequently, however he added to them the words \"in trust.'' His reason for doing so, he says, was to secure them from his creditors. Now, this fraudulent contrivance cannot have changed the ownership of these shares in favor of his child, or of anyone else. The two courts as to these twenty-four shares and the three shares were unanimous in the dismissal of the action. There were, however, dissenting opinions in the court of Appeal as to the other thirteen shares, but I think the majorty were right. These shares were subscribed for in trust, it is true, but Gibb was never a trustee. He was simply a debtor of his wife first, and later of his child and these shares so subscribed for could never be considered as a payment of his indebtedness. They were an offer of payment, a \"pollicitation\" which could always be withdrawn till acceptance. The company might have became altogether insolvent, and every cent on these shares a dead loss and yet Gibb would have continued to remain his child's debtor. The loss would have been for him and for him alone. And this is so as to the other twenty-seven shares as well as for these thirteen.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I concurred with Fournier J.\u2014that the appeal should be allowed.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I am of opinion that we should allow the appeal, not only in respect of the thirteen shares for which the two dissenting judges in the court below thought the plaintiff entitled to succeed but for the whole forty shares.\nGibb had borrowed from his wife $1355.67. That I understand to have been in 1880 the year after the firm of Major & Gibb was formed. The money was credited in the books of the firm to Mrs Gibb. She died in November 1880 and the account afterwards was headed \"Estatte Helen Gibb,\" the name being that of the infant daughter who became entitled in succession to her mother.\nGibb had another account in the ledger of his firm in his own name which showed $2,700 or thereabouts at his credit as capital in the business.\nBy his marriage contract he covenanted to settee on his wife $10000. She was to have the interest of that sum during her life and at her decease the principal was to belong to her child or children; and he also made over to her whatever amount should be received by him as one of the residuary legatees under the will of the late Beniah Gibb.\nHe did receive as residuary legatee certain sums, all or part of which he put into the business. Those sums he says were $1,583, and they together with other moneys of his own made up the $2,700. He did not pay over the $10,000 by any direct payment.\nThat was the position of things in 1884, when the defendant McFarlane united his business with that of Major & Gibb, and the joint stock company called the Major Manufacturing Company was formed.\nThe capital of the two partners in the firm of Major & Gibb was converted into shares in the capital stock of the new company.\nThe shares were $100 each.\nGibb subscribed for thirteen shares in the name\n\"Estate Gibb,\" which represented the $1,315.67, at the credit of the minor, less $15.67, which was paid him in cash to make even money.\nHe also subscribed in his own name as P. T. Gibb, for two allotments of twenty-four shares and three shares, representing $2,400 and $300, I don't think his reason for separating those two subscriptions is explained.\nSoon after the subscribing of these shares and it would seem within a very few days, Gibb wrote the words \"in trust\" in the stock book after the $2400 subscription, but not after that for $300, and he caused the same note \"in trust\" to be made in the ledger of the company against the whole twenty-seven shares.\nHis object in doing this is twice spoken of by him in his evidence. When examined on the 21st of October 1887, he stated to counsel for the defendant that when the words \"in trust\" were added he had many private creditors, but was not afraid at that time that they might attach the stock for his debts and that the money he owed was not more than he expected to be able to pay; and again on the 23rd of January, 1888 he said the words \u201cin trust\" were added in the following way : He was owing some money outside of his business and he added the words so that in case any one came down on him they could not touch this money as a portion of it did not belong to him. From these references to creditors it seems to have been considered by Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9, and I suppose by the other learned judges in the Queen's Bench, that the transaction was fraudulent as against the creditors of Gibb. I think too much effect was given to what was said. No creditor is stated to have been interfered with. It is not at once apparent how the marking the shares in trust would have affected creditors more than selling them to the defendant. But the reason given by Gibb that the fund did not altogether belong to him was quite consistent with what we learn from the evidence. I think, however, that the plaintiff's right may be put on stronger ground at all events as to the amount beyond the sum of $1,583 which came from the estate of Beniah Gibb.\nGibb was debtor to the minor in the sum just mentioned and in the further sum of $10000. I do not understand why he was not at liberty to appropriate the twenty-seven shares towards payment of his debt. It is true that he did not express in the books the name of the person interested in the trust but he tells us that he had the protection of the plaintiff in view. He may have thought in the first place of protecting her in respect of the Beniah Gibb money if that is the proper understanding of the answers to which I have adverted, but he was her debtor in respect of the $10,000 to the same extent. Her claim to the whole stood on the same footing under the marriage contract of her mother.\nNor do I perceive the importance, under all the circumstances of the omission to note in the stock list when the subscription for the twenty-four shares took place, the word \"in trust\" which were afterwards inserted in the list as well as in the ledger or the insertion of those words against the three shares in the ledger alone and not in the stock-list\nIf the view I have intimated as to the right to designate those twenty-seven shares as held in trust for the minor who was creditor of her father is correct the time when they were so designated cannot be material so long as it was before the shares were dealt with.\nThe use of his individual name in the subscription could not disable Gibb from afterwards devoting the shares to the payment of his creditor.\nA very important fact in the discussion is of course the fact of notice to the purchaser of the designation of the shares in trust. On that point the evidence was regarded as defective in the court of first instance with regard to all the shares and I think by all the learned judges who heard the case in the Queen's Bench with regard to the twenty-seven shares.\nIt is with diffidence that I venture to express a different apprehension of the effect of the evidence, but having regard to the facts that the purchaser was managing director of the company; that the evidence of his acquaintance with the contents of the books is as direct as it well could be short of actual demonstration, and agrees with what was his duty as managing director and that he wrote at the suggestion of the book-keeper asking Gibb to come and correct an irregularity in the transfer book of the forty shares the irregularity being the omission, which Gibh promptly supplied, of the words \" in trust\", the inference of fact that he had full knowledge, seems to me, to be lrresistible.\nMr. Justice Cross discussed this question of notice in reference to the thirteen shares, but otherwise it does not seem to have been dealt with in the Court of Queen's Bench where the opinion of Mr. Justice wait was probably adopted. The point made in the Queen's Bench was principally that the minor could not become the owner of the shares unless they were accepted in her name by some one authorised to act for her As expressed by Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9:\u2014\nOr cette cr\u00e9ance de Ia fille contre la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Major & Gibb n'a Pu par la seule volont\u00e9 du p\u00e9re, m\u00eame s'il \u00e8tait \u00e0 cette date tuteur de son enfant, \u00eatre convertie en a propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'actions dans la nouvelle com-pagnie par actions. II fallait quelqu'un d'autoris\u00e9 pour agir ainsi au nom de la mineure, et disposer ainsi de son bien. Le P\u00e9re ne \u00e9tait pas, et si nous prenons Ce qu'il nous dit pour vrai et que nous admet-tions qu'en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 ces treize actions \u00e9taient souscrites pour sa fille, il n'y avait pas l\u00e0 contrat entre lui et elle. Il y avait bien offre de sa part, mais la mineure n'avait pas accept\u00e8 et personne ne l'avait fait Pour elle. C'\u00e9tait tout au plus un e simple manifestation de la volont\u00e9 du d\u00e9biteur telle qu'elle existait alors, mais qui pouvait \u00e9tre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9e ou retiree par lui en tout temps avant acceptation par l'enfant. Le contrat ne devenait parfait que si l'enfant devenue majeure, ou son tuteur pour elle durant sa minorit\u00e9, trouvait Ia transaction avan-tageuse et l'acceptait. Pans le cas contraire ils Povaient la r\u00e9pudier, et avant l'acceptation le trust n'\u00e9tait pas complet.\nThis is said with special reference to the thirteen shares, but applies to all the others.\nThe proposition seems to me to be fallacious and opposed to the doctrine acted on in this court in Bank of Montreal v. Sweeny (1).\nIt may be that the daughter was not bound to accept the shares, and could have insisted, as against her father, on payment of her money, but she was at liberty to adopt the transaction and accept the shares. Gifts inter viros by article 787 of the Civil Code, do not bind the donor nor produce any effect until after they are accepted, but I do not understand the principles which govern gifts to apply to this transaction. It was not a gift that Gibb was making. His object was to apply the property in satisfaction, pro tanto, of a debt. For that purpose he earmarked the shares as the property of his daughter and creditor. That had always been so with regard to the $1300 and ii was so also with regard to the $2700 from a date earlier than the transaction with the defendant. The defendant took the shares thus earmarked, and if not absolutely the property of the minor, at least designated for her acceptance in case she elected to accept them. I attach much significance in support of this view, to the action of the defendant in requiring the words \" in trust\" to appear in the transfer to him. That was not the declaration of a new trust on which the defendant was to hold the shares. For that purpose he would not have required the intervention of Gibb. The addition of the words was made because the book-keeper called attention to the fact that the transfer, as first executed, did not recognise the title of Gibb as being merely the limited ownership of a trustee.\nOn these general grounds and on the authority of The Bank of Montreal v. Sweeny ([1]) I concur in allowing the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs\nSolicitors for appellant : Mac Master & McGibbon.\nSolicitors for respondent : MacLaren, Leet, Smith & Smith.\n[1] 12 Can. S.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier and Gwynne JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nSolicitor practising without certificate\u2014Allowing name to appear as a member of firm\u2014Estoppel.\nM., a solicitor who had not taken out the certificate entitling him to practice in the Ontario courts, allowed his name to appear in newspaper advertisements and on professional cards and letter heads as a member of a firm in active practice; he was not, in fact, a member of the firm, receiving none of its profits and paying none of its expenses, and the firm did not appear as solicitors of record in any of the proceedings in their professional business. The Law Society took proceedings against M. to recover the penalties imposed on solicitors practising without certificate, in which it was shown that the name of the firm was indorsed on certain papers filed of record in suits carried on by the firm.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court below, that M. did not \u201cpractise as a solicitor\u201d within the meaning of the act imposing the penalties (R.S.O. (1877) c. 140) and that he was not estopped, by permitting his name to appear as a member of a firm of practising solicitors, from showing that he was not such a member in fact.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] which suspended the appellant from practice as a solicitor and imposed a penalty of $40 for practising without a certificate.\nThe solicitor of the Law Society moved the Queen\u2019s Bench Division of the Divisional Court for an order suspending the appellant from practice as a solicitor until he paid the fees due to the society and a penalty of $40. The affidavit read in support of the motion stated that appellant practised during the year 1885 as senior member of the firm of Macdougall, Macdougall & Belcourt, and returns were produced from officers of the court in Ottawa and L\u2019Orignal showing the appellant\u2019s name among the solicitors practising in those courts for the said year.\nThe affidavit of the appellant in opposing the motion, and the evidence of J. M. Macdougall, were to the effect that while appellant\u2019s name appeared on the professional card of the firm, on the office sign, and in the advertisements, appellant had nothing to do with the firm business, received no share of its profits, and that his name was not used in any process issued or proceedings in suits carried on by the firm, all of which was done in the name of N. A. Belcourt; that the appellant had his own business as consulting barrister with which the firm had nothing to do; and that any solicitor\u2019s business offered to appellant was handed over to the other parties, who took all the profits resulting therefrom.\nThe professional card of Macdougall, Macdougall & Belcourt was put in evidence and was as follows:\u2014\n\u201cMacdougall, Macdougall & Belcourt, Avocats, Procureurs, &c., Scottish Ontario Chambers, Ottawa, Ontario.\nHON. WM. MACDOUGALL, C.R., FRANK M. MACDOUGALL, N.A. BELCOURT, L.L.M., Notaries Public.\nAgents pour les affaires de la Cour Supr\u00eame, du Parlement et des D\u00e9partements du Canada, &c. Les affaires de la Province de Qu\u00e9bec recevront l\u2019attention personnelle de Mr. Belcourt, membre du Barreau d\u2019Ontario et de celui de Qu\u00e9bec, et Commissaire pour cette derni\u00e8re Province.\u201d\nThe Queen\u2019s Bench Division held, and its decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, that the appellant was practising as a solicitor within the meaning of section 21 of \u201cThe Act respecting Solicitors,\u201d R.S.O. (1877) ch. 140, which section is as follows:\u2014\nSec. 21: \u201cIf any attorney or solicitor practises in any of the said courts, or in the county courts, without such certificate in each and any year of his practice, he shall be liable to be suspended from practice for any such offence in all of such courts for a period of not less than three nor more than six months, and to continue so suspended until his fee upon the certificate for the year in which he so practised without certificate is, together with the penalty of $40, paid to the treasurer of the Law Society, and the proceedings for such suspension may be taken in any of the said Superior Courts.\u201d\nBelcourt for the appellant. The statute is not violated by an uncertificated person advertising himself as a solicitor; he must practise as a solicitor in the High Court or in a County Court.\nPractising as a solicitor in this section means doing some act, as issuing a writ, entering an appearance or doing some other act in one\u2019s own name usually performed by a solicitor. See Law Society v. Waterloo[3]; Barnard v. Gostling[4]; Davis v. Edmonson[5].\nOne act of practice would not be sufficient. Re Horton[6].\nOn the construction of the statute, the fees being for revenue purposes only it should be stringently construed. Graff v. Evans[7], Ex parte Swift[8], Gordon v. Dalzell[9], Ford v. Webb[10], Stephenson v. Higginson[11].\nMarsh Q.C. for the respondents. If the partnership had been a true one the appellant would, clearly, have come within the terms of sec. 20 of the act. But the fact that there was no real partnership is immaterial. Our statute prohibits practising by uncertificated persons without the qualification in the English Act by the words \u201cfor fee or reward.\u201d\nThe statute is disciplinary as well as for purposes of revenue, and looks to the protection of the public.\nEdmonson v. Davis[12], and Dockings v. Vickery[13], were cited.\nSIR W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014Mr. Macdougall swears that:\nIn or about the month of November, A.D. 1884, my son, F.M. Macdougall, a barrister and solicitor in the Province of Ontario, entered into partnership with N.A. Belcourt, a barrister and solicitor in the said Province, and the said partnership or firm have since practised and are now practising as barristers and solicitors in the city of Ottawa.\nThat I have never read, or been made aware of the particular terms or stipulations of the said partnership agreement and have not now, and never had any pecuniary or other interest in the same.\nI have not for many years past practised as an attorney or solicitor in the courts of Ontario and have no desire or intention to do so.\nMr. Frank Macdougall is the only witness called on behalf of the Law Society. He positively swears that the firm of Macdougall, Macdougall & Belcourt consisted of Frank Macdougall & Napoleon Belcourt; that the Hon. William MacDougall had nothing whatever to do with the firm; that he had nothing to to with the firm\u2019s business at all; that the profits of the business are shared between Mr. Belcourt and himself; that William Macdougall\u2019s name appeared on the business card of the firm and on the letter headings, but he did not practice at all; that when they required counsel they give him a preference. And he also testifies as follows:\nQ.\u2014Does it (appellant\u2019s name) appear in any advertisement? A.\u2014Yes, I think so.\nQ.\u2014And on some papers filed in the courts? A.\u2014I think not. I am prepared to say that no writ has ever been issued by the firm of Macdougall, Macdougall & Belcourt. The writs are issued, and have always been issued in the name of Belcourt, so far as it is possible for me to say. That is the usual course of procedure.\nQ.\u2014I suppose the papers are endorsed in the firm\u2019s name? A.\u2014Yes, on the outside of the papers the firm style is used in endorsation.\nQ.\u2014And that is the way in which the business is carried on? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Have you William Macdougall\u2019s permission to use it in this way? A.\u2014In this instance, no.\nQ.\u2014It was ratified by him? A.\u2014Acquiesced by him.\nQ.\u2014He has always been aware of it? A.\u2014Undoubtedly; it is painted on the windows.\nQ.\u2014Stuck on the sign? A\u2014His name personally doesn\u2019t appear; but the style of the firm does; there is a sign at the front of the office with the firm name, and Mr. Macdougall\u2019s own name appears in that with that of myself and Belcourt.\nMr. Frank Macdougall made the following statement.\nAt the time of the partnership there was no intention that he should have any interest or any connection good, bad or indifferent with the firm; Mr. Macdougall has never done any business for the firm except as counsel, and has nothing whatever to do with the ordinary work of the office even when present; he has a business of his own in which the firm has no interest or connection whatever.\nBY MR. READ:\u2014\nQ.\u2014What is that business of his own? A.\u2014Advisory counsel for the Northwest Telegraph Company, counsel business exclusively; he has a separate business as advising counsel, and otherwise with which we have no connection; and furthermore we have received from him business to be done by our firm which he, as a barrister, could not do\u2014acting as a solicitor.\nQ.\u2014How much business? A.\u2014In two years past three or four cases.\nQ.\u2014And did you give him any share in the profits of that business? A.\u2014No. The writs having been issued in the name of Belcourt the subsequent proceedings would necessarily be carried on in his name. I think the mere endorsement of the name of the firm on the back of papers is no part of the proceedings in a cause, and consequently such an endorsement cannot be considered a practising. in the courts. The appellant\u2019s name was not used in issuing the writs, and except this endorsement I cannot discover that his name was used in any proceedings in any court. So far as there is any evidence all the proceedings in the courts were in the name of Mr. Belcourt, a duly qualified solicitor; therefore, I think that the evidence that the appellant practised entirely fails.\nThis being clearly a penal enactment no penalty should be inflicted under it unless the case is clearly within the spirit and letter of the statute imposing the penalty. I think the penal clauses of the act, R.S.O., (1877) ch. 140, do not apply to the appellant; that he is brought neither within the letter nor the spirit of the act and, therefore, no penalty has been incurred.\nI entirely agree with Chief Justice Armour and Mr. Justice Burton in the views they have taken of this case, and do not think it necessary to add any thing to what they have so clearly expressed.\nI think this appeal should be allowed with costs in this court and in the courts below.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This was originally an application to the Queen\u2019s Bench Division on behalf of the Law Society for an order that the present appellant, the Hon. William Macdougall, a solicitor of the Supreme Court of Ontario, should be suspended from practice for a period of three months and continue suspended until the fees due by him to the Law Society and a penalty of $40 should be paid. In support of the motion an affidavit of Mr. Walter Read, the solicitor of the Law Society, was filed as well as the deposition of Mr. Frank Macdougall, taken before an examiner, and in answer to the motion the appellant\u2019s own affidavit was read. The undisputed facts appearing from this evidence are as follows:\nIn or about the month of November, 1884, the appellant\u2019s son, Mr. Frank Macdougall, a barrister and solicitor, duly called to the bar and admitted to practise in the Province of Ontario, entered into partnership with Mr. N.A. Belcourt, also a barrister and solicitor for the same province.\nThere were no written articles of partnership but, as Mr. Frank Macdougall states in his deposition, there was a distinct verbal agreement of which an unsigned written memorandum was made. By the terms of this agreement the partnership business was to be carried on by, and the profits divided exclusively between, Mr. Frank Macdougall and Mr. Belcourt.\nThe name and style adopted by this firm was \u201cMacdougall, Macdougall & Belcourt,\u201d and it is admitted that by the first name of Macdougall the present appellant was meant to be indicated. \u00c0 printed business card in the French language used by the firm was produced, and upon it the following names appear, viz.: Hon. Wm. Macdougall, C.R., Frank M. Macdougall and N.A. Belcourt, L.L.M. The before-mentioned style of the firm was also painted upon the office window and on a sign affixed in front of the office, and appeared in newspaper advertisements. It is sworn that the appellant never interfered in or took any part in the business of the firm, and never derived any benefit from it, and it is not pretended that he in any way contributed to its expenses and disbursements. The appellant used for his own private business affairs a room in the offices of the firm, which was assigned to him by the partners in consideration of certain telephone accommodation which he enjoyed as counsel for a telegraph company, and which he permitted the firm to use for their own convenience. Mr. Frank Macdougall says he had no express consent or permission from his father to use his name in the style of the firm, but he says the appellant knew it was used in the way mentioned and acquiesced in it.\nIt is distinctly stated by Mr. Frank Macdougall in his deposition that the appellant\u2019s name in no way appeared in any of the legal proceedings carried on by the firm, save in so far as that \u201con the outside of the papers the firm\u2019s style was used in endorsation.\u201d Further, Mr. F. Macdougall says he thinks the firm\u2019s name was not used in papers filed in the courts, and he adds:\nI am prepared to say that no writ has ever been issued by the firm of Macdougall, Macdougall & Belcourt. The writs are issued and have always been issued in the name of Belcourt so far as it is possible for me to say. That is the usual course of procedure.\nMr. Frank Macdougall also in the course of his examination made the following voluntary statement:\nAt the close of the partnership there was no intention that he (the appellant) should have any interest or any connection, good, bad or indifferent, with the firm. Mr. Macdougall has never done any business for the firm except as counsel, and has nothing whatever to do with the ordinary work of the office even when present; he has a business of his own in which the firm has no interest or connection whatever.\nIt is admitted that the appellant did not take out any certificate as a solicitor and attorney for the year 1885.\nThe statutory provisions applicable are contained in the Revised Statutes of Ontario, (1877,) cap. 140, and are as follows:\nSection 16, sub-section 1. Each practising attorney and solicitor shall obtain from the Secretary of the Law Society annually, before the last day of Michaelmas Term, a certificate under the seal of said Society, stating the Superior Courts in which he is practising attorney or solicitor.\nSub-section 4. The Law Society shall determine what fees shall be payable for such certificates.\nSection 20. If any attorney or solicitor, or any member of any firm of attorneys or solicitors, either in his own name or in the name of any member of his firm, practises in any courts of Queen\u2019s Bench, Chancery, or Common Pleas, without such certificate being taken out by such attorney or solicitor, and by each member of his firm, he shall forfeit the sum of $40, which forfeiture shall be paid to the Treasurer of the Law Society for the uses thereof, and may be recovered in any of the said courts.\nSec. 21. If any attorney or solicitor practises in any of the said courts, or in the county courts, without such certificate in each year of his practice he shall be liable to be suspended from practice for any such offence in all of such courts for a period of not less than three nor more than six months, and to continue so suspended until his fee upon the certificate for the year in which he so practised without certificate is, together with the penalty of $40, paid to the treasurer of the Law Society, and the proceedings for such suspension may be taken in any of the said Superior Courts.\nThe certificate required by the 16th section is clearly for revenue purposes; in other words, it is a tax imposed upon solicitors who practise in the courts for the benefit of the Law Society by which the funds so raised are to be devoted to purposes which are no doubt highly beneficial to the profession of the law, and in which the public also are indirectly interested. These clauses are, therefore, to be construed strictly for the double reason that they are enactments for fiscal purposes, and also because they impose penalties and forfeitures.\nThe inquiry upon which the decision of this appeal must depend is, therefore, whether the evidence establishes that the Honorable William Macdougall practised in any of the courts without having taken out a certificate.\nWhat the effect of an uncertificated solicitor sharing profits with one duly qualified might be, under this statute, is a case we are not called upon to consider, inasmuch as it is distinctly proved and not disputed that the appellant received no part of the profits or emoluments of the firm or pecuniary advantage of any kind from its practice. It would, however, be impossible to hold such an arrangement by itself to be illegal practising by the unqualified person in the face of decisions by which it has been held perfectly legal to agree that a share of profits shall be paid to the widow of a deceased partner, or even to an unqualified solicitor, provided such person does not participate in the profits in consideration of his acting or taking proceedings as a solicitor. Scott v. Miller[14]; Candler v. Candler[15]; Sterry v. Clifton[16]; Lindley on Partnership.\nThe only way in which I can conceive a solicitor can be said to practise as such in the courts is by exercising the functions of a solicitor, by taking on behalf of a client some of the regular steps of procedure in an action or some other judicial proceeding.\nCan it then be said that Mr. Macdougall, by permitting his name to be used in the manner disclosed by the evidence, practised in either of the courts (or divisions) of Queen\u2019s Bench, Common Pleas or Chancery?\nI am of opinion that allowing his name to be used in the business card, in newspaper advertisements and on the office signs did not, upon any reasonable principle of construction which can be applied to the statute, constitute a practising. As I have before said the English cases show that sharing the profits of a solicitor\u2019s business with a disqualified person is not illegal when that person does not so share the profits in consideration of his acting as a solicitor. Then the use of the name of a disqualified person in the style of the firm, as in the case of a former partner who has retired from the practice of the profession, cannot possibly be considered by itself as a practising as a solicitor; that practice is common in England, and prevails not merely in the case of a retired partner but in the case of deceased partners as well. The new business is carried on in the name of the old firm for the sake of the goodwill associated with it. In short the name of the firm is nothing; the real question is: Did the disqualified person perform functions which the law says he shall not perform without having taken out a certificate? In the case reported in 4 Esp. relied on in both the Queen\u2019s Bench Division and the Court of Appeal, it is not for a moment pretended that the use of the name of the defendant in the style of the firm, nor the holding himself out generally as a practitioner by announcing himself as a partner, amounted to practising, but what was held to constitute the illegal act was that he had held himself out to the world as the attorney in a particular cause. In the present case the firm might never for the whole year which would have been covered by the certificate, the want of which is complained of, though carrying on a large business in other respects, have been once called upon to act as solicitors in any of the courts; how, in that case, would it have been possible to say they practised in the courts within the meaning of the 20th section of this act?\nThat there is nothing wrong in itself in qualified solicitors adopting as the name of their firms a style not exclusively composed of the proper names of actual acting partners is so apparent from the common practice which prevails as to it that no one would think of impugning the practice. An instance of it referred to in the judgment of Mr. Justice Burton is familiar to all of us who come from the Ontario Bar. The late Hon. Robert Baldwin, a distinguished attorney general of that province who also for a long time filled the office of treasurer of the Law Society, and who was a scrupulous observer of professional propriety, for years carried on practice under the name of Baldwin & Son, long after the death of his father Dr. Baldwin who was indicated by the first name in the style of the firm; and if I do not mistake, the late learned Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, Sir Adam Wilson, together with his partners, also for some years practised under the same name and style of Baldwin & Son.\nThese instances do not of course amount to anything like authority, but they do show very strongly what the opinion of men of high honor and eminent members of the profession as to the proper construction of the statute has been. I can see nothing, therefore, in the advertising and public announcement of the firm\u2019s name which amounts to practising within the meaning of the statute.\nIt remains to consider whether the endorsement of the partnership name on papers in actions actually instituted, and in other proceedings taken in the courts, is to be deemed a practising by the appellant. Assuming for the moment that this is the case I should, if we were driven to decide the point, feel bound to hold that the evidence before us was insufficient to warrant an order for suspension or a conviction for the penalty. We have no proof of any actual instance in which papers were so endorsed, but we have only the general statement of Mr. Frank Macdougall which ought not, I think, to be considered sufficient in a penal proceeding like the present; however, as it appears that the case can be disposed of on a broader ground, one which will afford a more complete vindication of the appellant, it is fairer to him not to rest the judgment on this point.\nHad it appeared that the actual proceedings in the courts had been taken in the name of the firm I should have had grave doubts if this would not have brought the appellant within the statute, though even in that case much might, I think, have been said, which we need not now discuss, in his favor. It is, however, stated by Mr. Frank Macdougall that in the formal proceedings in the courts Mr. Belcourt\u2019s name has always been used as the attorney of record, and not that of the firm. It is true that he only speaks of cases in which the firm have acted for plaintiffs and does not, in terms, allude to cases in which they have appeared as attorneys for the defence, but I understand him to speak generally, and at all events no instance was adduced by the respondents in which the firm appeared or took any proceedings as attorney of record for defendants.\nThis being so, are we to consider the mere endorsement of the writ with the style of the firm to amount to a practising as a solicitor by the appellant? I can see in such an endorsement nothing more than an announcement that a firm, carrying on its business with this name, were acting for the party on whose papers the announcement appeared, and nothing implying that every person whose name appeared in the style of the firm was personally engaged in conducting the proceedings. If the firm\u2019s name had been used in the formal proceedings, as for instance, if the pr\u00e6cipe for a writ had been signed, or an appearance entered, in the name of the firm that might possibly have been regarded as an actual exercise of professional functions by every one of the members whose names thus appeared on the files of the court.\nAs regards authority I entirely agree with Chief Justice Armour and Mr. Justice Burton that Edmunson v. Davis[17] is distinguishable. There the language of the statute was different and, as far as we can gather from the somewhat vague report, the defendant in that case, the unqualified attorney, actually appeared as one of the attorneys of record in the action in which it was alleged he had acted as an attorney. But even if the language of the statute applicable in that case had been identical with that of the 20th and 21st sections of the present statute, and even though the acts relied on as being in breach of the statute had been precisely similar to those here, I should, considering that the decision was a mere nisi prius ruling, reported in a book of so little authority as Espinasse,[18] have declined to follow that case, and I should have persisted in what I have already declared to be my own opinion of the proper construction and application of this statute.\nFor the foregoing reasons, which are the same as those stated in the judgments of Mr. Justice Burton and Chief Justice Armour, I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed and that an order refusing the motion should be substituted for that made by the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, with costs to the appellant in all the courts.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The question raised by this appeal is whether the appellant is or is not, under the circumstances of the case, a person who is subjected to the penalties of ch. 140 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1877, intituled \u201cAn Act respecting Attorneys at Law.\u201d By the 1st section of the act it is enacted that\u2014\nUnless admitted, and enrolled, and duly qualified to act as an attorney or solicitor, no person shall act as attorney or solicitor in any superior or inferior court of civil or criminal jurisdiction in law or equity, or before any justice of the peace, or as such sue out any writ or process, or commence, carry on, solicit or defend, any action, suit or proceedings, in the name of any other person, or in his own name.\nBy the 16th section\u2014\nEach practising attorney and solicitor shall obtain from the Secretary of the Law Society annually before the last day of Michaelmas Term, a certificate under the seal of the said Society, stating the Superior Courts in which he is a practising attorney or solicitor.\nBy the 20th section\u2014\nIf any attorney or solicitor, or any member of any firm of attorneys or solicitors, either in his own name, or in the name of any member of his firm, practises in any of the courts of the Queen\u2019s Bench, Chancery, or Common Pleas, without such certificate being taken out by such attorney or solicitor, and by each member of his firm, he shall forfeit the sum of forty dollars, which forfeiture shall be paid to the Treasurer of the Law Society, and may be recovered in any of the said courts.\nBy the 21st section\u2014\nIf any attorney or solicitor practises in any of the said courts, of Queen\u2019s Bench, Chancery, or Common Pleas, or in the County Courts, respectively, without such certificate, in each or any year of his practice, he shall be liable to be suspended from practice for any such offence in all of such courts for a period of not less than three nor more than six months, and to continue so suspended until the fee upon his certificate for the year in which he so practised without certificate is together with a penalty of forty dollars paid to the Treasurer of the Law Society, and the proceedings for such suspension may be taken in any of the said Superior Courts, and upon the vote being made absolute for such suspension in any of the said Superior Courts, such attorney or solicitor shall be suspended from practice in the other courts in the same manner and for the same period as if the rule had been made absolute also in each of the said courts.\nThe question before us arises under this 21st section of the act. Upon a motion by the respondents to the Divisional Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Ontario that the appellant should be suspended from practice for a period of three months and continue suspended until certain fees claimed by the society to be due by the appellant to them and a penalty of forty dollars should be paid, that court, Mr. Justice Armour dissenting, made an order whereby it was ordered that the said appellant be suspended from practice for a period of three months, and continue so suspended until the fees due by him to the Law Society, together with a fine of forty dollars, be paid, and that the appellant should also pay the costs of the said application to be taxed.\nUpon appeal from this order by the appellant his appeal was dismissed and the order affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, Mr. Justice Burton dissenting.\nThere is no dispute as to the facts of the case which briefly are as follows: The appellant had been a duly qualified attorney and solicitor and barrister, practising in the Ontario courts, but prior to the year 1885 he wholly ceased practising as an attorney and solicitor, and confined his practice to the profession of barrister and counsel only, and for this reason he did not take out any certificate as a practising attorney and solicitor for the year 1885, and it is for his not having taken out a certificate in that year that the order under consideration was made. In that year a son of the appellant, being a duly qualified attorney and solicitor, and who had duly taken out his certificate as such for the year 1885, entered into partnership with a Mr. Belcourt, also a duly qualified and certificated attorney and solicitor, practising in the same courts of Ontario. The appellant\u2019s son and Mr. Belcourt having thus formed a partnership between themselves in the business of attorneys and solicitors, without any prior application to the appellant for his leave and without his authority, styled the name of their firm\u2014\u201cMacdougall Macdougall & Belcourt,\u201d and published cards stating the firm to consist of the appellant, his said son and Mr. Belcourt. The appellant became aware of this having been done and did not make any objection to his son and Mr. Belcourt so using his name, but in point of fact he was not, nor was it ever intended that he should be, a member of the firm, nor had he, nor was it ever intended that he should have, any interest therein or in the profits thereof. All the business of every description carried on in the courts was conducted personally by, and in the name of, Mr. Belcourt. The appellant never in any way took any part in any business conducted by the firm or personally interfered in any such business. His name simply appeared in connection with the advertisements published by his son and Mr. Belcourt of the style of the firm in the names of Macdougall, Macdougall & Belcourt. The learned counsel for the respondents in his argument before us admitted that the appellant had not practised as an attorney or solicitor in the year 1885, in the popular sense of the word, but he nevertheless contended that he had within the meaning of the act; but there is nothing whatever in the act which indicates that the word practises as used therein is used in any other sense than the ordinary or popular sense of the word. It is the popular sense which is to attributed to all words in an act of Parliament, unless the contrary plainly appears upon the face of the act.\nHe contended that the appellant having permitted without complaint his name to be published as a member of the firm he would be liable to a client of the firm, who should have a good cause of action against the firm, and that in like manner and for the like reason he would be liable to the penalties by the act attached to his not taking out a certificate; but the liability to a person who, having employed the firm upon the faith of the appellant being a member of it as he was published to be, was damnified by any act or default of the firm, would arise by reason of the estoppel which under the circumstances the law would impose upon him preventing him from setting up the truth that in point of fact he was not a member of the firm. No case has been cited, and if one had been found no doubt the learned counsel for the respondents would have cited it, wherein it has been held that the doctrine of estoppel applies to prevent a person, against whom proceedings are taken under a penal statute to recover or inflict penalties, from shewing the truth, namely, that in point of fact and truth the thing had never been done to the doing of which the penalties sought to be recovered or inflicted were attached.\nIt was admitted that, in point of fact, all the acts of practising, with the doing of which the appellant is sought to be connected, were personally and directly done by Mr. Belcourt who was duly licensed to practice, but it was contended that Mr. Belcourt\u2019s acts were the acts of the appellant because of the latter having suffered his name to be used as it was. This is but another mode of insisting that having suffered his name to be so used he is, even in penal proceedings, estopped from shewing the truth. It was also argued that although Mr. Belcourt was the person who himself personally did each and every one of the acts relied upon as the acts of a practising attorney or solicitor yet that he, and every member of his firm how many soever they should be, are severally liable to the penalty imposed by the 20th section, and from that premise it was contended that he was liable under the 21st section. Whether Mr. Belcourt himself would be liable under the 20th section may possibly depend upon the true determination of the question whether or not he would be estopped from showing what is now admitted to be the truth, namely, that in point of fact the appellant was not nor was ever intended to be a member of the firm, but we are not dealing with the 20th section nor does it throw any light upon the true construction of the 21st that does not appear in the 21st itself, the language of which is, in my opinion, sufficiently clear, and deals with persons who, in the ordinary and popular sense of the word, do actually practise as attorneys or solicitors either alone or in partnership with others. All that the facts, in my judgment, warrant us in concluding that the appellant did was, not that he practised at all as an attorney or solicitor in the year 1885, but that he suffered his son and Mr. Belcourt, who did practice in partnership together as attorneys and solicitors, to publish his name as if he was a member of their firm, although in point of fact he was not nor was ever intended to be; that was not, in my opinion, an act to which the statute has annexed any penalty. The appeal must, therefore, be allowed with costs and the order of the Divisional Court of Queen\u2019s Bench discharged and in lieu thereof an order be ordered to be issued from the said court dismissing the application made to it with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: N.A.

Levi v. Reed, 6 Can. S.C.R. 482, and Gingras v. Desilets, Cassels's Digest 117, followed. (Taschereau J. expressing no opinion on the merits.)\nAPPEAL and cross-appael from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side) partly confirming a judgment of the Superior Court and reducing the amount awarded by the Superior Court from $2,000 to $500.\nThis was an action for slander and libel against Dun, Wiman & Co , who carry on in this country a mercantile agency for collecting information concerning persons in trade and commerce. The appellant complained that through false and incorrect reports made by the respondents to the firm of Hurteau & Brother, one of their subscribers as to his commercial standing and especially as regards hypothecs on his real estate he suffered heavy loss and was brought almost to the verge of bankruptcy and ruin. He claimed $10,000 damages. The respondents pleaded that the communication was privileged; that they were merely the agents of their subscribers for obtaining the information which they communicated to them\u2014also that they sent a report correcting the preceding false reports. The material facts are as follows (1):\nCossette the appellant was the owner of a saw and planning mill at Valleyfield, was doing a large business and was a contractor of large buildings, such as churches, market halls, &c., and to carry on his business and contracts he required a large credit in business circles, especially amongst the lumber merchants.\nHis credit was perfect up to February 1886, and all his circumstances of the most favourable character\nAmongst Other contracts, he had one for erecting a church at Longueuil, the cost of which was about one hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\nAbout the middle of February 1886, Hurteau & Brother lumber merchants of Montreal and the main suppliers of the appellant, seeing that the requirements of his affairs had caused the appellant to augment lately his purchases on credit by about five thousand, ($5,000.00) whilst his ordinary credit was already about twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00), and that new orders from him were coming in more frequently, applied to the agency of respondents, of which they were subscribers, in order to obtain additional information as to appellant's exact position as far as his real estate was concerned.\nThe appellant Cossette had always represented to them that his immovables were clear of mortgages and encumbrances. But they wanted to ascertain the fact in such a way as to leave no room for any doubt or anxiety.\nIt being customary to add a fee to their annual subscription to obtain a certificate from the registry office, they applied to the respondents for \"a special report from the Registry Office,\" offering to pay whatever additional cost might be required.\nIn conformity with that demand, the respondents provided them with a report which read as follows :\nFebruary 27th, 1886.\u2014Find by the valuation roll of Valleyfield that he has three lots in Valleyfield No. 1, Cadastral No. 589 valued at $700. At Registry office find sale by limitation, to Elizabeth Anderson of this lot and several other; mortgages for $4,000 payable to Antoine Leduc. Another for $6,000 to the corporation of St. Anicet, sale dated 1st April 1885, so that there is an encumbrance of $10,000 not discharged. This amount was due by the late Alex. Anderson.\nNo.2. Cadastral 788, on which is the mill, valued at $3,200 by valuation roll, mortgaged for $160. Two dollars per year rent, rente fonci\u00e8re non rachetable.\nNo 3. Cadastral 851, valued at $1,200 clear. His stock on lot 788 is valued by the corporation at $10,000.\u20143,400,500, N.Y.\nIn consequence of that report Hurteau & Brother began to curtail Cossette's credit, but applied again to the respondents assuring them that the report could not be correct, and asking for an additional and more minute inquiry.\nThe respondents then applied to Mr. Joron, a notary public, their local agent at Valleyfield, for information, and on the 18th March, 1886, he reported as follows:\nHe owns personally and alone a large mill and all the property for his woodyard would say that that property, taking its location, should be worth from $15,000 to $20,000, on which we are sure there was no mortgage a year and a half ago. This gentleman has been doing a fine business, and the following statement, which is altogether true, will show it : In 1883, a gentleman by the name of Emile Prevost, who is now the proprietor of the London Bros.' mill in this town, went into partnership with Mr. Cossette with a capital of $1,500. During twenty-two months that he was with him he increased his capital to $200 or $300 more. At the end of twenty-two months they separated, and though he had to pay interest on the surplus and capital put in by Mr. Cossette he got, when retiring, $6,000 cash from Mr. Cossette for his share in the partnership. Mr. Cossette has been continuing to do a good, a very good business, since and if we understand well he has been particularly lucky in a contract which he has made for wood last summer at some place near Three Rivers Mr Cossette owns some property beside that; he has his private house, worth about $2,500, and some other vacant lots; would think that should he get out of business at the present time, he could realize a sum varying from $15,000 or $20,000, or perhaps $25,000. He is one of the joint contractors of the Longueuil church; he has built the market hall here and has done good work; also the Roman Catholic church, in partnership with Mr. E. Prevost, and there also they have succeeded in doing splendid work. He is an active young man, married, about 32 or 35 years of age, of regular habits, honest and attentive to business. We understand that he has always kept his mill and wood insured.\nThe respondents did not act on this but on the 29th March, 1886, persisting in their report, as far as appellant's real estate was concerned, they added, gratuitously, the following report :\nMarch 29, 1886.\u2014The valuation given in last report is considered about correct. He is not considered worth much over and above liabilities. He is a Pontifical Zouave. Began with no capital. Had to compromise in 1877 or 1878 with Ross, Ritchie & Co., lumber dealers Three Rivers. Started manufacturing at Valleyfield with Emile Prevost. They made some money, but last year separated, and he paid Prevost $6,000 cash. Prevost, who is a smart fellow, then bought London Bros.' saw mill, and since then they have been at loggerheads. Last year Cossette bought a large amount of lumber, without capital, and has now most of it and cannot dispose of it. Looks for public honors. Has tried for the mayoralty several times. His business manager is not considered capable, is said to be extravagant, and has failed when in business for himself. The impression is considerable care should be exercised in credit transactions\u2014 3400-500\u2014N.Y.\nThe consequence of this report was that Hurteau & Brother closed down upon Cossette. An order which he had received for lumber was not executed. Without assigning any reason, they refused to give him Any further credit, and notified him that he would have to pay up the whole of his indebtedness. He wrote asking for the renewals which he had been in the habit of getting. They refused, and forced him to pay $12,000. To meet this sudden call upon him he was obliged to realise at once and to sacrifice a portion of his property. His mill at Valleyfield was burned down about this time; but it appeared that he had a very small amount of insurance and the defendants hastened to apprise Hurteau & Brother of this fact. Hurteau & Brother then investigated Cossette's affairs and found that the report made by the defendants was untrue; that he had had no mortgage upon his property. It appeared that the agent of the defendants had made a mistake as to the numbers of the properties, the three properties indicated as belonging to him were in reality not situated near his mill but at the other end of the town, and did not belong to Cossette at all, nor were they entered in his name, and the mistake could only arise from gross carelessness. Hurteau & Brother then found that they had done an injustice to Cossette, and offered him all the money necessary to rebuild his mill. The Town of Valley-field, however, came to his relief, and advanced money for the purpose of re-building the mill.\nTwelve days after the institution of the action the respondents, having heard of the falsity of their reports, informed Messrs. Hurteau & Brother of their mistake.\nEvidence having been taken as to damages suffered the Superior Court awarded the appellant $2,000 damages but on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench the damages were reduced to $500.\nIn the Supreme Court, when the case came up for argument Mr. Justice Taschereau stated that he thought a question of jurisdiction arose as to the amount in controversy. Counsel for the appellant and respondents, being desirous to obtain a final decision on the merits of the appeal, agreed to argue the case subject to the objection taken by the Court as to the jurisdiction.\nBelcourl for appellant :\nThe jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec and of France, as a matter of principle, admits of no distinction as to the responsibility that mercantile agencies incur by giving inaccurate information, no matter whether this information be given to all their customers or to only one or two subscribers (1).\nInformation furnished for pay, as a business matter, and not gratuitously, cannot be confidential.\nIn the present case the communications were not confidential even from the point of view of American and English jurisprudence, because : 1. The character of a communication is to be determined by its nature and object, and not by the purely accidental fact of its being made to only one or a few persons. Each and every one of the subscribers could have obtained it. It was not information collected for the exclusive use of Hurtean & Brother but for the use of the subscribing public. 2. Inaccurate and libelous facts were given that had not been asked for. 3. It was very easy to verify the information given. 4. It cannot be shown how these reports could have been made in good faith.\nFrom this tissue of falsehoods it is evident that there was malice either on the part of the respondents' employees at Montreal or on the part of their correspondent at Beauharnois.\nCossette might have been ruined had not an accidental circumstance (a fire) brought about the discovery of the untruthfulness of these reports. The amount of damages granted by the Superior Court ($2,000) not being excessive the Court of Appeal should not have changed it. Levi v. Reed (1); Gingras v. Desilets (2).\nBy condemning Cossette to pay all the costs of the appeal the Court of Appeal decided that Cossette should have nothing at all.\nLash Q.C. and Girouard Q.C. for the respondents.\nUnder the circumstances the communications complained of were privileged. Todd v. Dun, Wilman & Co, (1) : Waller v. Lock (2); Paterson on The Liberty of the Press (1) ; and the occasion being privileged, to use that term, the onus of showing express malice and absence of good faith rested on the plaintiff. Clark v. Molyneux (1); Mc lnter v. McCullough (1); Spill v. Maule (1) Fountain v. Boodle (1).\nThis case should be decided according to the principles of the English Law, and a privileged communication according to the law of England is stated in Strike on Slander (1), and cases quoted. These principles have been generally adopted by the courts of the Province of Quebec, which shows most conclusively that in matters of this kind the English law must prevail; Ferguson v. Gilmour (1); Poitevin v. Morgan (1); Durette v. Cardinal (1); Pacific Mutual Insurance Co. v. Butters (1); see also Dewe v. Waterbury (1); Carsley v. Bradstreet (2).\nAs to the French jurisprudence the last decision is that of Wallaerd v. Wys (1) in 1884 referred to by the appellants. But it can hardly be cited as favorable to his pretention. Here is the Juge : Lorsqu'il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les reseignements fournis sur la situation ou le credit des n\u00e9gocianss, par une agence de renseignements commerciaux, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s et libell\u00e9s par l'agence confidentiellement, dans les limites informations permises, et sans intention de nuire aux n\u00e9gociants sur le compte desquels les correspondants de l'agence prenaient des informations, il n'y a faute et responsabilit\u00e9 encourue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des n\u00e9gocianes qui se plaignent des renseignements fournis, que si ces renseignements sont notoirement inexacts. :\nIf we compare this last decision with the one given in 1862, we can safely conclude that the jurisprudence of the Tribunaux de commerce is in a fair way of reform and progress. As in England, they are slowly but surely bending the law to the usages of society.\nIt is perfectly evident that there is not much difference between the French and the English law on the subject of mercantile agencies and of its privileges and immunities. As remarked by Mr. Justice Cross in Carsley v. Bradstreet, the difference will be found more in the practical application of the law than the principles themselves. The French jurisprudence is perhaps more favorable to the agency acting, as the appellants did in this instance, upon a special request from an interested subscriber, and in a private and confidential manner. The communication being then confidential no action for damages is possible under the French law unless actual malice be proved. So says Mr. Justice Cross, quoting Gateau des Injures (1) : What in France would be considered a confidential communication would not give a title to a claim for reparation unless dictated by actual malice, while in England the same idea has given rise to a multitude of fine distinctions elaborated by the judges under the term of privileged communications.\nOne word as to the measure of damages. The report of the 29th of March could not have caused any damage, as it only reached M. M. Hurteau & Fr\u00e8re on the very day they discovered the mistake it contained. The report of the 27th of February, no doubt, caused some inconvenience to the appellant, but no serious injury as its confirmation had not been obtained. The books of the appellant were produced in court and they showed that the appellant, who at the time was doing a business of about $35,000 a year, was sustained by means of renewals of his paper; and judging from the books it does not seem that he was specially harassed in February and March, 1886, in consequence of the report of the 27th of February. The appellant had made heavy purchases in November and December for the Longueil church from Hurteau & Fr\u00e8re, all on time. Three notes to Hurteau & Fr\u00e8re became due between the 27th of February and the day of the fire, one for $1,31761, dated the 24th November, 1885, at 3 months; another for $1,950, and a third one $2,000, given in December, at 2 and 3 months and due in February and March, which were all renewed. From the books, no note was paid to these parties during that time. Judging from the statement of his monthly sales, as given by Edmond, the appellant does not seem to have suffered in that particular; indeed, his cash sales amounting to less than a couple of hundred dollars a month is a sure indication of a small general business. The judge in the court below seemed to have taken into consideration the damage done to the appellant as the partner of one Pr\u00e9fontaine for the construction of the Longueuil church. But it is evident that the court cannot consider the damage, if any, suffered by C Cossette & Pr\u00e9fontaine. When we consider that Mr. Carsley, with immense interests at stake amounting to millions of dollars, was only awarded $2,000 for a false and damaging communication published to the entire mercantile community, not only by means of their printed circular, but also by the medium of newspapers to which it had been given, it is almost impossible to resist the conclusion that the amount awarded is excessive. When examined sur faits et articles, appellant was unable to make a statement of his loss. To the question: Pouvez-vous chiffrer le montant des dommages que vous avez soufferts par suite de ces rapports, he answers: Le montant des dommages sera prouv\u00e9 dans la cause. Je. consid\u00e8re que ce ne serait pas cinquante mille piastres qui m'indemniseraient de tout ce que j'ai en \u00e0 souffrir. Quant aux d\u00e9tails, je ne puis pas les donner \u00e0 present. These details were never given and no special damage has been proved. The case was investigated according to the old system of enqu\u00eate, and the judge of the court below was not in a better position than the judges of this court to appreciate this question of damages.\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014The action in the present case is one of damages against a mercantile agency for slander, libel and defamation contained in false and malicious reports.\nThe judgment appealed from to the Supreme Court has been rendered by the Court of Queen's Bench Montreal, on the 26th of March, 1889, partly confirming a judgment of the Superior Court of Montreal, dated the 12th November, 1887, and partly reducing the amount awarded by the court of first resort.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench having reduced the amount of the judgment of the Superior Court to $500 the question has now been raised whether this court has jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. I think it certainly has, because it appears to me that the question before us is not as to $1,500 but simply whether the plaintiff has a right to have the judgment obtained by him in the Superior Court for $2,000 restored. Therefore the question we have to determine is: Did the Court of Queen's Bench do right in interfering with the judgment of the Superior Court, which awarded the plaintiff $2,000 damages? As I think they did wrong we should now reverse that judgment and give the judgment the Court of Queen's Bench should have given, that is to say instead of varying we should affirm the judgment of the Superior Court; and therefore the right of the plaintiff to hold his judgment in the Superior Court for $2,000 was the question before the Court of Queen's Bench and is the matter now in controversy before us in this court. Under these circumstances the case to my mind is clearly appealable.\nThe agreement under which the information complained of was furnished to Hurteau & Brother is as follows :\nTERMS OF SUBSCRIPTION TO THE MERCANTILE AGENCY.\nMemorandum of the agreement between Dun, Wiman & Co., proprietors of the mercantile agency on the one part, and the under-signed, subscribers to the said agency, on the other part, viz :\u2014\nThe said proprietors are to communicate to us, on request for our use in our business, as an aid to us in determining the propriety of giving credit, such information as they may possess concerning the mercantile standing and credit of merchants, traders, manufacturers, &c, throughout the United States and the Dominion of Canada.

GIROUARD,\nAvocat des D\u00e9fendeurs.\nThe information asked for by Hurteau & Brother was in reference to the real estate of the plaintiff and to incumbrances or hypothecs thereon (if any) and to that alone. This by a proper and careful examination at the Record Office could easily have been obtained and of this Cossette would have had no cause to complain and if a truthful answer bad been returned to this enquiry by no possibility could Cossette have been dandified for two reasons; first, because the records are for the purpose of being examined; secondly, had they been examined with any degree of reasonable care, they would have shown that the plaintiff's property was unincumbered.\nThe following is the first report complained of:\u2014\nFIRST REPORT.\nOCTAVE COSSETTE,\nSawmill, Valleyfleld, Que.\nFebruary 27, 1886.\u2014Find by the valuation roll of Valley field that he has three lots in Valleyfield; No. 1, cadastral No. 589, valued at $700. At Registry Office find sale by licitation, to Elizabeth Anderson, of this lot and several others; mortgages for $4,000, payable to Antoine Leduc. Another for $60000 to the Corporation of St. Anicnt, sale dated 1st April, 1885, so that there is an incumbrance of $10,000 not discharged. This amount was due by the late Alex. Anderson.\nNo. 2 Cadastral 788 on which is the mill, valued at $3,200 by valuation roll, mortgaged for $160. Two dollars per year rent: rente fonci\u00e8re non rachetable.\nNo. 3 Cadastral 851 valued at $ 1,200, clear. His stock on lot 788 is valued by the Corporation at $10,000. 3,400 500\u2014N.Y.\nall of which is entirely false from beginning to end.\nAfter attention had been called to this report, on the 29th March a second report was made as follows s\nMarch 29th, 1886.\u2014The valuation given in last report is considered about correct. He is not considered worth much over and above liabilities. He is a Pontifical Zouave. Began with no capital. Had to compromise in 1877 or 1878, with Ross, Ritchie & Co., lumber dealers Three Rivers. Started manufacturing at Valleyfield with Emlle Pr\u00e9vost. They made some money, but last year separated, and he paid Pr\u00e9vost $6000 cash. Prevost, who is a smart fellow, then bought Loudon Bros.' sawmill, and since then they have been at loggerheads. Last year, Cossette bought a large amount of lumber, without capital and has now most of it and cannot dispose of it. Looks for public honors. Has tried for the mayoralty several times. His business manager is not considered capable; is said to be extravagant and has failed when in business for himself. The impression is considerable care should be exercised in credit transactions. 4400\u2014 500 N.Y.\nOn March 18th the defendants had received, through Mr. Dawes, the chief clerk of their agency in Montreal, the following very favorable report :\nMarch 18 1886.\u2014He owns personally and alone a large mill and all the property for his woodyard; would say that that property, taking its location should be worth from $15,000 to $200000, on which we are sure there was no mortgage a year and a half ago. This gentleman has been doing a fine business, and the following statement, which is altogether true, will show it : In 1883, a gentleman by the name of Emile Pr\u00e9vost, who is now the proprietor of the Loudon Bros.' mill in this town went in partnership with Mr. Cossette with a capital of $15000. During twenty-two months that he was with him he increased his capital to $200 or $300 more. At the end of twenty-two months they separated, and though he bad to pay interest on the surplus and capital put in by Mr. Cossette, he got, when retiring, $6000 cash from Mr. Cossette for his share in the partnership. Mr. Cossette has been continuing to do a good\u2014a very good\u2014business since, and if we understand well, he has been particularly lucky in a contract which he has made for wood last summer at some place near Three Rivers. Mr. Cossette owns some property besides that; he has his private house, worth about $2,500. and some other vacant lots; would think that, should he get out of business at the present time, he could realize a sum varying from $15,000 to $20,000, or, perhaps, $25,000. He is one of the joint contractors of the Longueuil Church. He has built the market hall here, and has done good work; also, the Roman Catholic church, in partnership with Mr. E. Pr\u00e9vost, and there, also, they have succeeded to do splendid work. He is an active young man, married, about 32 or 35 years of age, of regular habits, honest and attentive to business. We understand that he has always kept his mill and wood insured.\nWhich, however, was not furnished to Hurteau & Brother, but which the defendant's clerk says was read to the book-keeper of Cossette, but which Cossette's book-keeper denies, claiming that only a portion of it was read, namely, to the $6,000 mentioned therein. On the 29th March, notwithstanding this favorable report of the 18th March, and notwithstanding that their attention had been called to the report of the 27th February, the report of the 29th March, above set out, was made; and on April 13, 1886, Cossette having called on the defendants, the following entry was made by them in their books :\nCossette, Octave\u2014Saw-mill and lumber, Beauharnois Valleyfield, Que., Canada\u2014J. E. L., April 13, '86\u2014Calls and states that our report of Feb. 86, in re his property is incorrect, that he does not own the properties there mentioned; but his properties are cad. Nos. sub. div. 141-d., JL 41-c, 141-8. 141-10, 141-11, 141-12, 141--3, in parish of Ste. C\u00e9cile, which cost $2,400, and are mortgaged for $1,200; cad. Nos. 137, 138 and 141, in Valleyfield; bought from sheriff for $1,440, clear half of Nos. 507, 508, on which was his mill, lately burned, clear of incumbrance, and he shows us certificates from registry office, which carry out his statement as to properties. Denies also that he ever compromised with Ross, Ritchie & Co.; says he had bought two barges of lumber for them which he instructed them to send him in charge of a tug, but they did not follow out his instructions, and allowed them to sail without the tug, the barges got caught in a gale of wind and foundered, the amount of the purchase was $1,600, and he paid Ross, Ritchie & Co. $800, which he considers was more than they were entitled to as they had not carried out his instructions.\nAnd it was not until a month after, namely, the 17th May, 1886, that they reported that\nCOSSETTE, OCTAVE.\u2014Mill and Lumber, Valleyfield. Beauharnois County, Quebec, Canada.\nW. W. J., May 17, 1886.\u2014Having sent for a special inquiry by messenger to the Registry Office at Beauharnois, we have learned that our report of his real estate position in February last was a mistake and altogether erroneous, the wrong cadastral numbers having been taken. Mr. Cossette's statement of April 13, in correction of our report seems to be a statement of facts apparently. We have also written Ross Ritchie & Co., of Three Rivers, who confirm Mr. Cossette's statement as to the settlement of the barge load matter referred to in previous reports, and by enquiry at the Insurance Companies, we learn that the loss sustained through his fire in April was between 15 and $20,000, and on this he received an insurance of about $3200 the Royal and the Insurance Association being the only two companies interested. Mr. Cossette has been granted a bonus of several thousand dollars from the town and stands well among fair judging men. He is. a good energetic business man and doing quite well. 3400\u2014500\u2014N. Y.\nIt may be that as between Hurteau & Bro. and the agency that they were not authorised to communicate to Cossette the information furnished, and there may have been a breach of contract on the part of Hurteau & Bro., but this is a question the agency and the employer must, I think, settle between themselves. It is clear, however, that the information was given to be acted upon, and was acted, upon to Cossette's detriment, and but for his mill being burnt would, if not contradicted, have resulted in his utter ruin. It is difficult to understand, if acted upon, how it could be kept from the knowledge of the party injured; he would necessarily require to know why confidence had been lost in him and if not informed of the reason how could he correct the information, if erroneous, and withheld from him? I am unable to understand what duty the agency was under to supply information to their customers except in virtue of the contract between them by which, for a valuable consideration, they undertook to do so. But even as between them-selves, could it have been contemplated that false information should he supplied?\nBut apart from this contract in reference to the plaintiff in this case with other third parties what duty was there on the part of the agency to inter-meddle with the plaintiff's property, affairs or business? And if they did so intermeddle, was there not a higher duty due to the party inquired of that the information supplied in reference to him should be true? When-ever, by culpable negligence or the want of proper precaution not truthful but false information is supplied, whereby a third party is damnified in his business, property or credit, why should the party so injured by the wrongful act of the agency not be indemnified for the loss he has sustained by the injury done him by the agency who by their act caused the damage?\nIn this case no proper precautions appear to have been exercised. Surely no man has a right to propagate a false statement, injurious to the credit of another without having satisfied himself of its truth or falsity before adopting and promulgating it as truthful and useful information. Would it not be a most dangerous and unreasonable doctrine to hold that a man's reputation and credit could be destroyed by secret false information, furnished, as it were, behind his back, and the knowledge of which is withheld from him and the truth of which the agency is under no obligation to guarantee? Cossette does not appear to have had any connection or contract with the agency. They had no interest in his business, but appear to have intermeddled with it for certain reward, paid them without his authority, and made statements unfounded in fact, in reference thereto, with a view to such statements being acted upon and which were acted upon to his injury. There was no duty, as I have said, cast on the agency to furnish this information except their contract to do so, to which Cossette was no party. They furnished it voluntarily for pure gain. I cannot conceive that if a man who for gain and reward voluntarily intermeddles with another man's business, and issues false reports in reference thereto to be acted upon by the party receiving it, is in any way privileged so to do; if he does it I think he does it at his peril. I by no means intend to dispute the proposition in English law, that a communication made bon\u00fb fide on any subject matter in which the party communicating has an interest, or in reference to which he has a duty, is privileged if made to a person having a corresponding interest or duty, although it contains criminatory matter which, without this privilege, would be slanderous and actionable (1). This company may be and probably is useful to the mercantile world, but it is clear its usefulness must depend on the care they take to promulgate only truthful information. I think therefore the damage in this case was caused solely by the fault of the agency; that there was on their part and on the part of those whom they employed the greatest and most culpable negligence, carelessness and impropriety without taking any reasonable or proper precautions to ascertain the truth of the statements.\nBut apart from discussing this question on general principles or principles applicable to English law, I think that this case, if ever a case did, clearly comes within Articles 1053 and 1054 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada which provide as follows :\n1053. Every person capable of discerning right from wrong is responsible for the damage caused by his fault to another, whether ly positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of skill.\n1054. He is responsible, not only for the damage caused by his own fault, but also for that caused by the fault of persons under his control and by things which he has under his care.\nBut in addition to all I have said the agency attempted to discredit Cossette entirely apart from the information asked for. Thus, on March 28 1886, after they had in their possession the report of the 18th March, of their own mere motion they reported that Cossette was not considered worth much over and above liabilities, an unfounded and incorrect statement. That he was a Pontifical Zouave. What that had to do with his credit it is difficult to discover, unless it was by way of disparagement, of the truth of which, however, there is no evidence. That he began with no capital; that he had to compromise in 1877 or 1878 with Ross, Ritchie & Co. lumber dealers in Three Rivers. A statement quite untrue and no attempt to show that the agency had any grounds whatever to justify or excuse this statement. That he last year bought a large amount of lumber without capital and has now the most of it and cannot dispose of it,'' of the truth of which likewise no evidence was offered. That he looks for public honors, of which there was no evidence. Has tried for the mayoralty several times which is contradicted by the evidence, and is not sufficient to disparage the credit of Cossette. The report goes on to attack his credit through his business manager thus: His business manager is not considered capable; is said to be extravagant and has failed when in business for himself, without showing in any way the truth of this or where or how this information was obtained, and winds up with the impression is considerable care should be exercised in credit transactions.\nConsidering that the only information asked for was a report of the amount of mortgages or hypothecs affecting Cossette's real property, if evidence of malice was required in this case, which I do not think it was, I can scarcely conceive that stronger evidence of malice could be shown than these volunteered, unasked for and reckless statements, without a title of evidence to show that defendants even believed them to be true, or that they had any reason whatever for thinking or believing them to be true.\nThis leaves the case then a mere question as to the amount of damages to which Cossette is entitled. The court of first instance arrived at the conclusion that the plaintiff had established his claim to $2,000. I cannot say that this is a wrong conclusion. In a case of this kind we have no means of weighing m very nice scales the exact amount of damages the plaintiff may have sustained. A grievous wrong was clearly done him, calculated to wreck his business and utterly ruin his credit. He has conclusively shown that in fact for the time being it had that effect, and therefore he was entitled to very substantial damages. He has clearly shown, from his business being entirely disarranged, and his credit, for the time being, utterly destroyed, he was, for the purpose of raising money, compelled to sell his property below the ordinary rate. The general evidence shows he lost $1,500 to $2,000, though it is true that the specific items of this loss were not shown; that he also lost by reason of Hurteau & Bro.'s refusal to supply him with lumber, it is stated, four or five hundred dollars, and was otherwise, beyond all doubt, greatly damaged in his business and credit. If we were to allow the judgment now appealed from, which not only reduced his judgment of $2,000 to the comparatively trifling sum of $500 and which judgment also has mulcted him in the costs of the appeal court, to stand, it is obvious that he will be, after paying those costs, practically without the slightest remuneration for the wrong done him and this without any fault or wrong on his part. I therefore think the appeal should be allowed, and the judgment of the Superior Court restored, and also that the cross-appall be dismissed, with costs to the appellant in this court and in all the courts.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014L'appelant en cette cause \u00e9tait demandeur en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure dans une action en dommage de $10,000.00.\nLa cour rendit jugement en sa faveur pour la somme de $2000.00.

Pratt (1) est aussi invoqu\u00e9 contre le droit d'appel en cette cause. Le Conseil Priv\u00e9 a confirm\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle qu'il avait adopt\u00e9 dans la cause de McFarlane et Leclaire et d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le droit d'appel du d\u00e9fendeur est d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par le montant accod\u00e9 au demandeur. Cette decision n'est applicable qu'\u00e0 un d\u00c9fendeur condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 moins de $2,000. Elle n'est pas applicable \u00e0 un demandeur qui a obtenu un jugement fixant ses dommages \u00e0 $2,000 et qui demande \u00e0 \u00eatre r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9 dans les droits acquis par ce jugement. L'appel est ici pour $2,000. Pour pr\u00e9tendre que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'appel est moins de $2,000, il faudrait prouver qu'il a acquiesc\u00e9 au jugement dont il se plaint Il a fait pr\u00e9cisement le contraire et son int\u00e9r\u00eat est en entier pour les $2,000. Peut-on pr\u00e9sumer que le jugement qui n'accorde que $500, est plus correct que celui qui accorde $2000. C'est \u00e9videmment lecas de regarder au jugement et \u00e0 la procedure pour d\u00e9cider qu'il doit y avoir appel. En cons\u00e9quence je suis d'avis qu'il y a appel.\nAu m\u00e9rite je suis du m\u00eame avis que le juge en chef.\nL'appelant constructeur et propri\u00e9taire de moulin \u00e0 scie, a poursuivi les intim\u00e9s qui font affaires, en la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al et ailleurs comme agence commerciale et de renseignements concernant la position et la solvabilit\u00e9 des commer\u00e7ants, pour la somme de $10,000, pour avoir fourni \u00e0 MM. Hurteau et fr\u00e9re, avec lesquels il \u00e9tait en affaires pour un montant consid\u00e9rable de faux renseignements au sujet de son credit et des hypoth\u00e9ques gr\u00e9vant ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s immobili\u00e8res.\nLes intim\u00e9s ont plaid\u00e9 que les renseignements fournis \u00e0 Hurteau et fr\u00e9re, souscripteurs \u00e0 leur agence ne l'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 qu'en vertu d'une convention d\u00e9clarant que ces renseignements sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme priv\u00e9s, confidentiels et donn\u00e9s sans garantie quant \u00e0 leur exactitude. Que ces renseignements out \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s de bonne foi par les intim\u00e9s qui les croyaient corrects et forment en consequence une communication privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e qui ne pent donner lieu \u00e0 une action en dommage contre eux.\nCette action est fondee sur les articles 1053 et 1727 C.C. Toute personne capable de discerner le bien du mal, est responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 par sa faute \u00e0 autrui, soit par son fait, soit par imprudence, n\u00e9gligence ou inhabilit\u00e9\nLe mandant est responsable envers les tiers pour tous les actes de son mandataire faits dans l'ex\u00e9cution et les limites du mandat; except\u00e9 dans le cas de l'article 1738 et dams le cas ou par la convention ou les usages du commerce, le mandataire en est seul responsable.\nLe mandant est aussi responsable des actes qui exc\u00e8dent les limites du mandat lorsqu'il les a ratifi\u00e9s express\u00e9ment ou tacitement.\nL'exception mentionn\u00e9e en cet article n'a aucun rapport quelconque aux fait de la pr\u00e9sente cause. La question de savoir si c'est le droit fran\u00e7ais on anglais qui doit servir de r\u00e8gle dans le cas present est plus que oiseuse. Lorsque la loi s'explique aussi clairement qu'elle le fait dans les deux articles pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s le doute n'est pas permis. Dans la cause de Carsley v. Bradstreet (2).\nL'honorable juge Loranger dont le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 en appel dit :\nIt has been said by the plaintiff's counsel that the French Law must apply, and so do I rule.\nCette d\u00e9cision est aussi br\u00e8ve quejuste.\nEn f\u00e9vrier et mars 1886, l'appelant avait des contrats importants pour la construction d'\u00e9glises et autres grands \u00e9difices et faisaient des affaires consid\u00e9-rables et prosp\u00e8res pour lesquelles ii avait besoin de tout son credit. Ses relations d'affaires principales \u00e9taient avec la maison Hurteau et fr\u00e8re marchand de bois envers lesquels il se trouvait alors endett\u00e9 en la somme de $23000. Ceux-ci ayant constat\u00e9 que depuis quelque temps les besoins de fournitures de bois de l'appelant avait beaucoup augment\u00e9, et que ses demandes devenaient plus fr\u00e9quentes, jug\u00e8rent \u00e0 pro-pos de demander \u00e0. l'agence mercantile des intim\u00e9s dont ils \u00e9taient souscripteurs, des informations sur sa position et surtout au sujet de ses immeubles qu'il leur avait toujours repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s comme exempts d'hypoth\u00e8que. Sur le rapport de leurs agents et employ\u00e9s ils inform\u00e8rent faussement Messieurs Hurteau et fr\u00e9re que les immeubes de l'appelant \u00e9taient grev\u00e9s au mon- tant de plus de $10,000 d'hypoth\u00e9que, et leur firent rapport de plus qu'il avait derni\u00e9rement compromis avec un de ses cr\u00e9anciers, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Ross, Ritchie et Cie, ce qui \u00e9tait aussi faux que l'existence des hypoth\u00e8ques rapport\u00e9es comme affectant ses immeubles.\nLe 29 mars 1886 les intim\u00e9s persistant dans les assertions mensong\u00e8res de leur rapport pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, firent le suivant sans aucune demande ni sollicitation de la part de Hurteau et fr\u00e8re (1).\nChaque proposition contenue dans ce rapport est une fausset\u00e9 manifeste. Au lieu de corriger leur premier rapport qui avait indiqu\u00e9 comme dues, par l'appelant des hypoth\u00e8ques affectant des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qui ne lui avaient jamais appartenu, on dirait qu'anim\u00e9s d'un violent d\u00e9sir d'exercer quelque vengeance particuli\u00e9re, ils se plaisent \u00e0 entasser les fausset\u00e9s les unes sur les autres sur le compte de l'appelant afin de le ruiner; on le repr\u00e9sente comme ne valant gu\u00e8re plus que le montaut de ses dettes, ayant commenc\u00e9 les affaires sans capital et compromis en 1877 ou 1878 avec Messieuss Ross Ritchie et Cie, marchands de bois de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res On rapporte aussi de pr\u00e9tendues difficult\u00e9s qu'il a eues avec un nomm\u00e9 Prevost qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 son associ\u00e9, qu'il avait achet\u00e9 l'ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente une quantit\u00e9 de bois consid\u00e9rable dont il ne pouvait plus se d\u00e9faire, qu'il recherchait les honneurs publics, et avait essay\u00e9 plusieurs fois de se faire \u00e9lire comme maire, que son g\u00e9rant d'affaires manquait de capacit\u00e9s, \u00e9tait extravagant et avait failli en affaire pour son compte; qu'enfin on ne saurait \u00eatre trop prudent avec lui\n(1) Sec p. 226. dans les affaires \u00e0 cr\u00e9dit. Tous les faits de ce rapport sont faux et calomnieux. Rien n'\u00e9tait plus facile pour eux que de s'assurer de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. En s'adressant au bureau d'enregistrement, ils auraient eu de suite un certificat correct des hypoth\u00e8ques qui pouvaient exister contre l'appelant. C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment dans ce but quills ont \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9s, et c'est un acte impardonnable de n\u00e9gligence grossi\u00e9re et coupable de leur part que d'aller chercher leurs renseignements sur ce sujet ailleurs que dans ces bureaux. Mais ii y a encore un fait plus inexplicable de leur part, c'est que pendant que les intim\u00e9s communiquaient \u00e0 MM. Hurteau et fr\u00e8re et \u00e0 leurs bureaux d'agences, cet inconcevable rapport, ils \u00e9taient en possession do la preuve de toutes les fausset\u00e9s qu'il contenait par le rapport de leur agent r\u00e9gulier \u00e0 Valleyfield, le notaire Joron, en date du 18 mars 1886 d\u00e9clarant les faits suivants : \u2014\nCe rapport qui contredit directement et prouve la fausset\u00e9 de toutes les assertions de celui du 29 mars \u00e9tait en la possession des intimes depuis onze jours, lorsqu'il donnait encore communication du rapport mensonger du 29 mars.\nLes consequences des faux rapports que les intim\u00e9s soutenaient avec tant de persistance ne tard\u00e8rent pas \u00e0 se produire; Hurteau et fr\u00e8re qui \u00c9taient les principaux fournisseurs et avanceurs de fonds de l'appelant, d\u00e9cid\u00e8rent de lui refuser credit et de le forcer de payer son compte. Pendant que l'appelant avait le plus besoin d'avances pour l' ex\u00e9cution de ses contrats et qu'il ordonne de nouveaux chargements de bois, il se volt refuser l'ex\u00e9cution de ses commandes; les billets qui deviennent dus doivent \u00eatre pay\u00e9s en entier et des renouvellements lui sont refus\u00e9s. Et cela dans le temps de la construction de l'\u00e9glise de Longueuil, lorsque son cr\u00e9dit aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre le double de ce qu'il \u00e9tait, il se voit r\u00e9duit de $25,000 \u00e0 $12,000 dans le mois d'avril. Ili fut alors oblig\u00e9 de d\u00e9ployer toute son \u00e9nergie et d'employer toutes ses ressources, r\u00e9aliser \u00e0 sacrifice afin de maintenir son credit et \u00e9viter la ruine dont ii ne fut sauve que par un accident. Au milieu de toutes ses difficult\u00e9s, son moulin et sa manufacture furent d\u00e9truits par un incendie. Sur ses entrefaites Hurteau se rendit \u00e0 Valleyfield pour s'enqu\u00e8rir de la position de l'appelant qu'il trouva satisfaisante apr\u00e8s examen des livres de compte, et apr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre enquis de faits rapport\u00e9s contre lui, et dont il constata l'enti\u00e8re fausset\u00e9. Gr\u00e2ce an montant de ses assurances et \u00e0 la confiance que MM. Hurteau reprenait en lui, I'appelant put \u00e9viter la d\u00e9route compl\u00e8te de ses affaires. Mais les intim\u00e9s ne firent absolument rien pour r\u00e9parer les torts qu'ils avaient commis \u00e0 son \u00e9gard; ils ne firent aucune contradiction de leurs faux rapports et ne donn\u00e8rent jamais \u00e0 M. Hurteau communication du rapport de Mr. Joron, qu'apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9manation de l'action en cette cause. A l'enqu\u00eate le montant des dommages \u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 diversement \u00e9valu\u00e9; fix\u00e9 \u00e0 une somme consid\u00e9rable par quelques t\u00e9moins et \u00e0 beaucoup moins par d'autres, la cour faisant.une appr\u00e9ciation mod\u00e9r\u00e9e de la preuve a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 le montant de ces dommages \u00e0 la somme de $2,000. Sur appel \u00e0 la Cour du Banc de la Reine le montant de la condamnation a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duit \u00e0 la somme de $500. Cossett\u00e9 a appel\u00e9 de ce jugement et demande \u00e0 faire r\u00e9tablir celui de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. La seule question \u00e0 decider sur le present appel est celle du montant des dommages qui devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9.\nLes intim\u00e9s ont invoqu\u00e9 leurpr\u00e9tendue bonne foi dans la communication des renseignements, mais outre que la bonne foi ne peut \u00eatre une excuse des dommages caus\u00e9s par leur imprudence, n\u00e9gligence on incapacit\u00e9, ii y a une preuve positive de la n\u00e9gligence grossi\u00e8re et coupable de leur agent dans la collection des renseignements En prenant comme appartenant \u00e0 l'appelant des lots qui ne lui appartenaient pas et en faisant rapport \u00e0 Hurteau et fr\u00e8re qu'ils \u00e9taient grev\u00e9s d'hypoth\u00e8qnes, leur agent a n\u00e9cessairement agi par malice, imprudence, n\u00e9gligence grossi\u00e8re ou incapacit\u00e9, car il \u00e9tait facice d'obtenir du bureau d'enregistrement des renseignements certains. Ce fait seul suffirait pour rendre les intim\u00e9s responsables du dommage cause. Mais ind\u00e9pendamment de cela il est prouv\u00e9 qu'ils avaient en mains le rapport du notaire Joron, un de leurs agents \u00e9tablissant la fausset\u00e9 de toutes les informations qu'ils avaient communiqu\u00e9es \u00e0 MM. Hurteau et fr\u00e8re et quills n'en Firent aucune communication qu'apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivis. Ceci forme une preuve de malice et d'intention de faire tort \u00e0 l'appelant que rien ne contredit dans la preuve des intim\u00e9s.\nLa pr\u00e9tention des intim\u00e9s que leur communication \u00e0 Hurteau et fr\u00e8re \u00e9tait confidentielle et que la nature d'une telle communication les exempte de responsabilit\u00e9 pour dommage est inadmissible. Elle est contraire \u00e0 la loi et \u00e0 la jurisprudence \u00e9tablie.\nIl est inutile d'aller chercher soit dans le droit anglais soit dans le droit am\u00e9ricain la solution de cette question. Les principes de ces l\u00e9gislations n'\u00e9tendent pas la responsabilit\u00e9 aussi loin que les art. 1053 1054 du code civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Des articles ne font pas de la malice un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la responsabilit\u00e9, ni de la bonne foi une exemption de cette responsabilit\u00e9. Pour qu'il y ait responsabilit\u00e9, il suffit qu'il y ait faute imprudence, n\u00e9gligence on inhabilit\u00e9.\nLe quasi-d\u00e9lit,(dit Laurent) (1), existe d\u00e8 qu'ily a faute la plus l\u00e9g\u00e8re, la moindre imprudence suffit; telle est la tradition, telle est la doctrine telle est la jurisprudence. Pour qu'il en f\u00fbt autrement dans le cas de renseignements inexacts, il faudrait une exemption \u00e9crite dans la loi, et il est inutile d'ajouter que la loi ne fait aucune exemption \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et absolue de l'art. 1382 (correspondant \u00e0 notre article 1053). Sans doute la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise consid\u00e8re comme privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e certaines confidences, telles que celles qui sont faites dans certains cas, comme par exemple les informations donn\u00e9es par un ma\u00eetre au sujet ' du caract\u00e8re d'un serviteur qu'il a eu \u00e0 son service, par un marchand au sujet d'un commis. Mais ces informations sont donn\u00e9es gratuitement \u00e0 titre de service. De plus toutes les communications que l'on desire garder secretes ou confidentielles ne peuvent pas \u00eatre faites pour r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, Sirez Rev. Gen. (2), et non pas vendues comme une marchandise \u00e0 tant par rapport ou souscription annuelle \u00e0 des rapports fournissant r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des renseignements sur les affaires des commer\u00e7ants C'est un genre d'affaire adopt\u00e9 par les agences commerciales qul font ce commerce de renseignement, moyennant consid\u00e9ration p\u00e9cuniaire. La jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise consid\u00e8re ces agences mercantiles, quant a la responsabilit\u00e9 civile, sur le m\u00eame pied que tout autre commerce. Des d\u00e9cisions nombreuses out \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues par les tribunaux fran\u00e7ais sur cette question. Le factum de l'appelant en contient plusieurs auxquelles il serait facile d'en ajouter d'autres.\nLa Cour de Li\u00e8ge a rejet\u00e9 cette th\u00e9orie de pr\u00e9tendu privil\u00e8ge des lettres et rapports (2), des agences commerciales en se fondant sur le motif qu'elles faisaient profession de vendre des renseignement d'affaires aux marchands.\nJournal des tribunaux de commerce pour l'ann\u00e9e 1885, p. 302, pour l'ann\u00e9e 1877, (Yol. 26,) p. 16.\nDans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, ii y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 plusieurs decisions \u00e0 ce sujet. Carsley v. Bradstreet (1); and in Appeal (1): Girard v. Bradstreet judgment of Justice McKay, confirmed in Appeal in 1875 (15 February) (1).\nLe jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure avait condamn\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 $2000 mais la Cour du Banc de la Reine l'a r\u00e9duit \u00e0 $500. C'est sur ce point que repose principalement le present appel. Lorsque l'on consid\u00e8re toutes les circonstances qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9es plus haut, peut-on dire que la condamnation \u00e0 $2,000 soit exag\u00e9r\u00e9e. Certainement non. D'abord la preuve testimoniale, non seulement justifie ce montant, mais la n\u00e9gligence grossi\u00e8re et coupable dans la collection des renseignements, la persistance malicieuse des intim\u00e9s \u00e0 en faire usage pendant qu'ils en connaissaient la fausset\u00e9 d'apr\u00e8s le rapport du notaire Joron, sont des circonstances qui auraient justifi\u00e9 un plus fort montant de dommages.\nPour reformer ce jugement quant au montant ii faudrait d\u00e9montrer qu'il y a eu erreur de fait ou de droit ou partialit\u00e9 de la part du juge. Il n'v a absolument rien de tel dans ce cas comme la Cour du Banc de la Reine la reconnu en admettant la responsabilit\u00e9 des intim\u00e9s et en les condamnant \u00e0 $500 de dommages. Les deux cours n'ont diff\u00e9r\u00e9 que sur l'appr\u00e9ciation des dommages laiss\u00e9s \u00e0. l'arbitrage des juges, c'est le cas de faire l'application de la r\u00e8gle qu'aucune erreur n'\u00e9tant d\u00e9montr\u00e9e le jugement doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9.\nCette question de la difference d'appr\u00e9ciation des dommages par les cours Sup\u00e9rieuee et d'Appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 soulev\u00e9e devant cetre cour, dans les causes de Levi v. Reid (1) et dans celle de D\u00e9silets v. Gingras (1). Dans ces deux causes la cour se fondant sur les autorit\u00e9s du droit fran\u00e7ais et pour les raisons contenues dans ces deux jugements auxquels je r\u00e9f\u00e8re a r\u00e9tabli le montant des dommages tels quills avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fixes en premier lieu par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Pour les m\u00eames raisons je suis d'avis que le jugement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine 611 cotte cause doit \u00eatre r\u00e9form\u00e9 et le montant de $2,000 de dommages accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appelant, en premier lieu, par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure soit r\u00e9tabli En cons\u00e9quence, l'appel doit \u00eatre allou\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion to quash this appeal. The case is not appealable. The plaintiff, now appellant, obtained a judgment for $2,000 in the Superior Court. The defendants thereupon brought an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, where they succeeded in getting the judgment reduced to $500. The plaintiff now appeals to this court from the Court of Queen's Bench. Upon this appeal, the only controversy clearly is as to the $1,50.0 which the Court of Queen's Bench reduced from the judgment of the Superior Court. Now it seems to me that we cannot entertain the appeal. The right principle on which to establish what is the amount in contestation when the amount is the limit of the right of appeal is, as laid down by the Privy Council in Macfarlane v. Leclaire (1) reaffirmed in Allan Pratt (1) that the judgment appealed from is to be looked at as it affects the interests of the party who thinks he is prejudiced by it, and who seeks to relieve himself from it by appeal. Here, the appellant only complains of that part of the judgment which deprived him of $1,500. This judgment clearly affects his interests as to $1,500 only and he only appeals from a judgment of $1,500. Upon his appeal there can be no contestation whatever as to the $500 for which the appellant succeeded in the court below.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I entertain no doubt that this is an appealable case. The plaintiff recovered judgment in the Superior Court in the Province of Quebec for $2,000 damages in an action for libel. The only defence offered to the action was that the matter complained of, although admitted to be false, was a privileged communication as having been made in the course of their business by the detendangs as commercial agents for the purpose of obtaining information concerning persons engaged in trade to a person who had employed them to obtain for him certain particular information as to the condition of and charges upon certain real property of the plaintiff. The defendants appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court to the Court of Queen's Bench at Montreal in appeal insisting that no action lay against them upon the ground that the communication complained of was privileged and that although it was in point of fact untrue it was made in good faith and without actual malice. The falsehood of the matter complained of was, it may be observed, attributable to very gross carelessness upon the part of the persons employed by the defendants to obtain the information which they were asked to obtain for the person who had requested them to obtain the information. The Court of Appeal held the judgment of the Superior Court to be free from error upon the ground for which the appeal had been taken, namely, that the matter complained of as a libel was a privileged communication, made bon\u00e2 fide and without actual malice, but they reduced the damages to $500 and condemned the now appellant to pay the costs of the appeal, although he had succeeded upon the ground of error taken to the judgment of the Superior Court. From this judgment the plaintiff now appeals and the question before us is whether or not the Court of Appeal at Montreal did or did not err, in our opinion, in rendering that judgment. We are bound to give the judgment which, in our opinion, that court should have given, and to do so the same question must be before us as was before it, namely, whether the plaintiff was not entitled, and is not therefore still entitled, to retain the judgment which was rendered in his favor by the Superior Court for $2000, and whether the Court of Appeal at Montreal has not erred in interfering to deprive him of that judgment and to substitute therefor a judgment for $500. This is, to my mind, clearly a question involving a sum of $2,000 as the amount in litigation.\nThen upon the merits, while concurring with the Court of Appeals and the Superior Court that the action well lay I am of opinion that the Court of Appeals did err in reducing the damages. Whatever privilege the defendants might have insisted upon if the information they had given to their client had been confined to the particular matter they were requested to obtain information upon (as to which, or as to the effect which their great negligence which occasioned that information to be false should have on the question of privilege I express no opinion) it is clear that the defendants wholly voluntarily communicated to their client matter which was not only absolutely without foundation in point of fact, and gravely and injuriously affecting the character and solvency of the plaintiff, but was altogether outside of the matter they were asked to obtain information upon, which was simply as to the charges upon a particular piece of property belonging to the plaintiff, a piece of information which could have been obtained by a search upon the piece of land in the Registry Office, and which by reason of the gross negligence of an agent employed by them was not done.\nUpon the question of reduction of damages I am of opinion that the cases of Gingras v. Desilets (1) and of Levi v. Reid (1) in this court must be taken as establishing the principle which is well settled in England and conformable with sound sense, namely, that no court has any right to reduce the verdict of a jury as to damages where a jury is the tribunal, or of a judge adjudicating without a Jury, on the ground of the damages being excessive in cases in which, like the present, the damages recoverable are not ascertainable by the application of any rule prescribing a measure of damages, or are not determinable by precede calculation, unless the damages awarded be so excessive, having regard to the evidence, as to shock the understanding of reasonable persons; to be so outrageous, in fact, that no reasonable twelve men, if the tribunal be a jury, could give; and that no judge, if a judge be the tribunal, could rationally give, that is without like shock to the understanding of reasonable persons. The question is not what damages the judge sitting in appeal thinks he would have given if he had tried the case, but whether the judge who did try the case can with propriety be said (as in the case of a jury) to have acted altogether beyond the bounds of reason in awarding the amount of damages which he has awarded. This cannot well be said in the present case, for some of my learned brothers think the damages given by the learned judge of the Superior Court to be reasonably moderate in their view of the evidence. Not having tried the case I cannot for my part precisely say what damages I should have given if I had tried it : I think it sufficient to say that in my opinion the Court of Queen's Bench in appeal should not set aside a judgment on the ground of excessive damages, or have reduced the amount awarded in the present case unless upon the ground that the amount awarded by the Superior Court was altogether and palpably beyond the bounds of reason; and this cannot, I think, with any propriety be said in the present case, whether I should or should not have given the same amount myself if I had tried the case.\nI think, therefore, that the appeal must be allowed with costs of this court and of the Court of Appeals in the Province of Quebec, and that the judgment of the Superior Court should be restored.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014 It is not, and cannot be, disputed that, in construing the 29th section of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act., R.S.C., ch. 135, we are bound by the principles enunciated and acted on by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Mac-farlane v. Leclaire (1), in 1862 and in \u00c1llan v. Pratt (1), in 1888. That section declares that no appeal shall lie from any judgment rendered in the Province of Quebec in any action, &c, wherein the matter in controversy does not amount to the sum or value of $2,000, unless under circumstances which do not exist in this case. The decisions cited show that the controversy to be considered is that which is carried to this court, and which is not necessarily co-extensive with that originally entered upon. Whatever ambiguity there may seem to be in the section may be made to disappear, without doing any violence to the language, by simply bringing the word wherein into more direct connection with the word appeal l as e. g. : No appeal wherein the matter in controversy does not amount to the sum or value of $2000 shall lie, &c.\nIt is very usual to find that the value in controversy on an appeal is less than that which was originally in contest, and we have in Macfarlane v. Leclaire an instance where the value to the appellant was much higher than it could have been to the respondent. There are many cases where the limitation founded on the amount in controversy seems to act unequally between the parties, as when a plaintiff claiming more than $2,000 obtains judgment for less. In that case the defendant could not appeal, while if the defendant had succeeded the limitation would not have stood in the way of an appeal by the plaintiff. Macfarlane v. Leclaire affords an example of this occasional absence of reciprocal power to appeal, and shows that it does not as has been sometimes thought, tell against the construction now given to section 29.\nThe principle, as stated by Lord Chelmsford in Macfarlane v. Leclaire and repeated by Lord Selborne in Allan v. Pratt, is that the judgment is to be looked at as it affects the interests of the party who is prejudiced by it and who seeks to relieve himself from it by appeal.\nIn this action the plaintiff Cossette, claimed $10,000 damages. The court of first instance awarded him $2,000. From that judgment the plaintiff did not appeal. The defendants appealed, and on their appeal the Court of Queen's Bench sustained the plaintiff's right of action but reduced the damages to $500.\nFrom that judgment there are two appeals to this court.\nThe plaintiff appeals, complaining of the deduction of $1500 from his damages and the defendants appeal on the ground that the judgment ought to be altogether in their favor.\nIf these two appeals could properly be treated as one appeal it might be plausibly urged that the whole amount of $2,000 was in controversy. I. cannot however see my way to that position. The effect would be to put us in the position of the Court of Queen's Bench hearing the appeal from the Superior Court, whereas we have to review the judgment of the Queen's Bench only. The appeals from that judgment are separate appeals. The defendants by their appeal seek to be relieved from the judgement for $500. That is the extent to which their interests are affected by the judgment.\nThe plaintiff's case is that his interests are affected to the extent of $1500 by the deduction of that amount from his damages. Thus the amount in controversy on the one appeal is $1,500 only, and on the other $500 only.\nI think, therefore, that both appeals are unauthorised.\nI should be better leased to come to a different conclusion. Not that I object to the limitation of the right of appeal; I think it is founded on wise policy, and should be frankly given effect to in all proper cases, But, having considered the appeals on their merits, I am satisfied that the courts decided correctly when they sustained the plaintiff's right of action. Nor would I have been disposed to disturb the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench with regard to the amount of damages. The appeal to us is from that court only, and having regard to the fact that the damages, though technically unliquidated, are nevertheless brought by the evidence to some extent within the range of approximate calculation, and the court has in the exercise of its undoubted jurisdiction, and after a careful consideration of such data as are available fixed the amount at $500 I should hesitate before saying that the judgment was wrong in this particular. At the same time the award of the costs of the appeal against the plaintiff who successfully repelled the attack upon his right of action, though the court estimated his damages on a different scale from that which seemed proper to the judge who tried the action, strikes me as harsh and even unjust and in order to relieve the plaintiff from that hardship I should be strongly tempted to concur with those of my learned brothers who think that the plaintiff's appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Superior Court restored.\nOn the question of jurisdiction, however, I am of opinion that both appeals should be quashed without costs\nAppeal allowed with costs and judgment of the Superior Court restored\nSolicitors for appellant; Trudel, Charboneau & Lamothe.\nSolicitors for respondents : Girouard & DeLorimier.\n"

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Fournier, Gwynne and Patterson J.J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nMortgage\u2014Rate of interest\u2014Fixed time for payment of the principal\u2014\u201cUntil principal and interest shall be fully paid and satisfied.\u201d\nA mortgage of real estate provided for payment of the principal money secured on or before a fixed date \u201cwith interest thereon at the rate of ten per centum per annum until such principal money and interest shall be fully paid and satisfied.\u201d\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that the mortgage carried interest at the rate of ten per cent. to the time fixed for payment of the principal only, and after that date the mortgagees could recover no more than the statutory rate of six per cent. on the unpaid principal. St. John v. Rykert (10 Can. S.C.R. 278) followed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas Division and the ruling of a referee appointed to take an account of the amount due on defendants\u2019 mortgage.\nThe single question raised on this appeal was as to the construction of a covenant in a mortgage for payment of interest. Such covenant provided that the mortgage would be void on payment of the principal sum \u201con or before the first day of June, 1884, with interest thereon at the rate of ten per cent. per annum until such principal money and interest shall be fully paid and satisfied, such interest being payable and to be paid quarterly.\u201d There was also a provision that interest at the same rate should be paid on any instalment of interest in default, the same to be compounded and added to the principal half yearly.\nThe plaintiffs in this action were the mortgagor and the beneficiaries under certain insurance policies given as collateral security to the mortgagee, and the action was brought to redeem the said policies. A reference having been ordered to take an account of the amount due on the mortgage the referee, in taking such account calculated the interest at ten per cent. up to the first of June, 1884, and from that time he only allowed interest at six per cent., and did not compound the interest after that date. The defendants appealed to the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas Division, claiming the interest as provided in the mortgage up to the time of taking the account. The ruling of the referee was affirmed by the Chief Justice, and on further appeal to the Court of Appeal his judgment was also confirmed. The defendants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nDelamere Q.C. for the appellants. The courts below decided against us on the authority of St. John v. Rykert[2], but this case may be distinguished. St. John v. Rykert2, was a case of a promissory note on which judgment had been recovered. The peculiarly strong words of our covenant distinguish it from that case and from Peck v. Powell[3].\nThe following cases were cited as instances of similar covenants: King v. Greenhill[4]; Popple v. Sylvester[5]; Ex parte Fewings[6]; Ex parte Furher. In re King[7]. Beck for the respondents. In St. John v. Rykert2, the words were \u201cuntil paid,\u201d which cannot be construed differently from those in this case, \u201cuntil fully paid and satisfied.\u201d In Archbold v. Building and Loan Association[8], Mr. Justice Street similarly construes the words \u201cuntil fully paid off and satisfied.\u201d And see Re European Central Railway Co.[9]; Powell v. Peck3; Wilson v. Campbell[10].\nIt was urged that the mortgage should be construed most strongly against us in accordance with the rule fortius contra proferentem but that rule has no force at the present time. Elplinstone on deeds[11]; Taylor v. Corporation of St. Helens[12].\nSIR W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The defendants admit the allegations in the first paragraph of the statement of claim contained, and say that the said mortgage is in the words and figures following, that is to say:\u2014\nThis indenture made in duplicate the 31st day of May, 1881, in pursuance of the act respecting short forms of mortgages, between Alexander Grant of the city of Toronto, in the county of York and Province of Ontario, barrister-at-law, and Annie Grant of the same place, wife of the said Alexander Grant, hereinafter called the mortgagors of the first part, and the People\u2019s Loan and Deposit Company, hereinafter called the company of the second part.\nWitnesseth, that in consideration of seven thousand five hundred dollars, now paid by the company to the mortgagors, (the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged), the mortgagors do grant and mortgage unto the company (their successors and assigns) forever, all and singular that certain parcel or tract of land and premises situate, lying and being in the city of Toronto aforesaid, on the north west corner of Duke and Parliament streets, in the said city, being composed of part of lot fifteen, the whole of lot sixteen and part of lot seventeen, according to plan 7 A, and being ninety-four feet on Duke street, and extending along the westerly limit of Parliament street two hund- red and four feet: Provided this mortgage to be void on payment at the office of the company in the city of Toronto of $7,500 in gold coin if so demanded, on or before the 1st day of June, 1884, with interest thereon at the rate of ten per cent per annum until such principal money and interest shall be fully paid and satisfied, such interest to be paid quarterly, on the 1st day of June, September, December, and March, the 1st payment thereof to be made on the 1st day of September next, together with all fines imposed by the company on, the mortgagors on account of default in payment according to the company\u2019s rules, and taxes and performance of statute labor: Provided that on default of payment for two months of any portion of the interest hereby secured the whole of the principal hereby secured shall become payable at the option of the company.\n\u201cShall be fully paid and satisfied\u201d necessarily refers to the time fixed for payment, viz.: \u201cOn or before the 1st of June, 1884, and the interest to be paid quarterly on the 1st of June, September, December and March, the first payment thereof to be made on the 1st day of September next;\u201d in other words, until fully paid and satisfied according to the times fixed in the deed. I can see nothing in these words to show any intention to extend the time of payment of principal or interest beyond the respective times named in the mortgage. The last gale day would be the 1st June, 1884. It is quite an error to say there is any provision in this mortgage for post diem payments. There is no payment provided for after the 1st June, 1884, on which day, if not paid before, the principal and interest then due is made payable. There was no contract to pay beyond the period for which the money was borrowed.\nI think the rate of interest allowed by the referee as damages was, under the evidence before him, most reasonable. Independent of the fact that as a general rule interest by way of damages should be the statutory rate of interest it is quite impossible to distinguish this case from St. John v. Rykert[13]. There the words were \u201cwith interest at the rate of two per cent. per month until paid.\u201d What possible difference is there between \u201cuntil paid\u201d and \u201cuntil fully paid and satisfied?\u201d If the money secured is \u201cpaid\u201d is it not \u201cfully paid?\u201d And if the debt is \u201cpaid\u201d is it not \u201csatisfied?\u201d The debt cannot be \u201cpaid\u201d without being \u201cfully paid and satisfied\u201d; the terms \u201cpaid\u201d and \u201cfully paid and satisfied\u201d are equivalent terms, the meaning being precisely the same, the only difference being that in the one case one word, and in the other four are used to express the same idea.\nSTRONG J.\u2014On the 31st of May, 1881, Alexander Grant (one of the present respondents) and Annie Grant his wife, since deceased, by indenture of that date, mortgaged certain land and hereditaments to the appellants to secure the repayment of $7,500 lent and advanced by the appellants to the mortgagors and interest thereon; and by an indenture of the same date the respondent, Alexander Grant, assigned to the appellants three policies of assurance on his own life, viz.: a policy for $4,000 in the Canada Life Assurance Company and two policies, each for \u00a3499 19s. sterling, in the Eagle Insurance Company, as further and collateral security for the same loan. These several securities were subject to the following proviso for redemption:\nProvided this mortgage to be void on payment at the office of the company, in the city of Toronto, of $7,500 in gold coin if so demanded, on or before the 1st day of June, 1884, with interest thereon at the rate of ten per cent. per annum until such principal money and interest shall be fully paid and satisfied, such interest being payable and to be paid quarterly, on the 1st day of June, September, December and March, the first payment thereof to be made on the 1st day of September next, together with all fines imposed by the company on the mortgagors on account of default in payment according to the company\u2019s rules, and taxes and performance of statute labor; Provided that on default of payment for two months of any portion of the interest hereby secured the whole of the principal hereby secured shall become payable at the option of the company.\nThe mortgage deed also contained the following clause:\nAnd it his hereby declared that in case the company satisfies any charge on the lands, other than a certain mortgage at present held by the Canada Life Assurance Company, the amount paid shall be payable forthwith with interest at ten per cent. per annum, and in default the power of sale hereby given shall be exercisable, and in the event of the moneys hereby advanced or any part thereof being applied to the payment of any charge or incumbrance, including the said mortgage of the Canada Life Assurance Company, the company shall stand in the position of, and be entitled to all the equities of, the person or persons so paid off.\nThere was also inserted in the mortgage a power of sale as follows:\nProvided that the company, in default of payment for two months, may without any notice enter upon and lease or sell the said lands for cash or credit.\nPrior to the execution of the before mentioned mortgage, and on the 13th of June, 1877, the respondent, Alexander Grant, and his wife had mortgaged the same lands and premises to the Canada Life Assurance Company to secure the sum of $6,000 and interest at eight per cent., and had assigned to and deposited with the last mentioned company the same policies of assurance as collateral security for that amount, and such mortgage and deposit and assignment of policies were subsisting securities at the date of the execution of the mortgage and assignment of policies to redeem which the present action was instituted and were, in fact, paid off out of the loan advanced by the appellants. The mortgage to the Canada Life Assurance Co. was subject to the following proviso:\nProvided this mortgage to be void on payment of six thousand dollars in gold, with interest at eight per cent. as follows:\u2014The said principal sum of six thousand dollars at the expiration of one year from the date hereof, with interest in the meantime, payable half- yearly on the thirteenth day of December and the thirteenth day of June, at the rate of eight per cent. per annum, and on payment of all sums of money which may be requisite, or which the said mortgagees, their successors or assigns, may pay or expend for premiums of insurance against loss by fire in terms of the covenant hereinafter contained, or for premiums upon the several policies of insurance upon the life of the said Alexander Grant hereinafter mentioned, with interest at the rate aforesaid upon such premiums and taxes and performance of statute labor.\nSubsequently to the mortgage to the Canada Life Assurance Company, and on the 28th February, 1879, an indenture was executed to which Alexander Grant and his wife and the Canada Life Assurance Company were the only parties, whereby the time for payment of the money thereby secured was extended until the 13th of December, 1881.\nThe appellants were, by the express terms of the mortgage of the 31st of May, 1881, subrogated to all the rights of the Canada Life Assurance Company in respect of their securities paid off as before mentioned. By the deed of assignment by the Canada Life Assurance Company to the appellants, which was dated the 2nd day of June, 1881, and to which Alexander Grant and his wife were parties, it was admitted that the amount then due to the Canada Life Assurance Company and assigned to the appellants was the sum of $7,025 for principal and interest, and $400 for expenses.\nOn the 24th of August, 1877, prior to the date of the appellant\u2019s mortgage but subsequent to the mortgage to the Canada Life Assurance Company, Alexander Grant by endorsement upon the policies under his hand declared, pursuant to the statute in that behalf, that the said policies, and the sums payable thereunder, should be for the benefit of his wife for her natural life, and on her decease to such of his children as should be living at the time of the death of his said wife in proportions more fully set out in the endorsement. Mrs. Grant having died, the respondents other than Alexander Grant are, as the children of Alexander Grant, who survived his wife, absolutely entitled to the policies and the monies payable thereunder at the death of Alexander Grant, subject only to such charge thereon as the appellants may be held to be entitled to.\nDefault having been made in the payment of the principal money secured by the mortgage of the 31st May, 1881, the appellants, on the 28th of July, 1888, sold the mortgaged lands for the sum of $10,360, and this amount of purchase money was received by them from the purchaser. The respondents other than Alexander Grant thereupon tendered to the appellants the sum of $120, and demanded a re-assignment of the policies. This demand having been refused by the appellants, who claimed a much larger sum to be due than the amount tendered, this action was instituted to compel a re-assignment of the policies. The action having come on to be heard upon a motion for judgment before Mr. Justice Rose on the 28th day of May, 1889, it was ordered and adjudged that it be referred to the registrar of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division for inquiry and report, pursuant to R.S.O. cap. 44, sec. 101.\nThe referee having heard evidence and considered the accounts laid before him subsequently made his report, dated the 27th June, 1889, whereby he found and reported that the mortgage security in the first paragraph of the statement of claim mentioned fell due on 1st June, 1884, and that the defendants were not entitled to any interest after that date under the terms of the contract in the mortgage security contained or under any contract; and the referee assessed the appellant\u2019s damages at the rate of six per cent. per annum on the unpaid principal moneys from 1st June, 1884 until they received payment. The referee further found that the several insurance policies in the indenture in the second paragraph of the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim mentioned were, on the 24th day of August, 1877, assigned by Alexander Grant to the plaintiffs other than himself, who are now entitled to those policies; and that the plaintiff, Alexander Grant, by the indenture in the second paragraph of the statement of claim mentioned, assigned the policies to the defendants as collateral security for the indebtedness under the mortgage in the first paragraph of the statement of claim mentioned, and to secure the repayment of any premiums the defendants might pay in respect of the policies, but the plaintiffs, other than Alexander Grant, were not parties to such assignment to the defendants and were not bound thereby; and that the defendants had advanced in payment of insurance premiums upon the life insurance policies assigned to them, as in the second paragraph of the statement of claim mentioned, the sum of $253.53, and that they were entitled under the terms of the said assignment to the sum of $24.79 interest thereon, making together the sum of $278.32, from which sum the sum of $181.59, due by the defendants, having been deducted, there was left a balance of $96.73 due to them in respect of life insurance premiums which were a charge on the said life policies; that under and by virtue of a certain indenture of mortgage, dated the 13th day of June, 1877, made by the said Alexander Grant and Annie Grant to the Canada Life Assurance Company, the said Alexander Grant and Annie Grant mortgaged the said lands to the Canada Life Assurance Company to secure $6,000 and interest; that by assignment dated the 13th day of June, 1877, the said Alexander Grant assigned to the Canada Life Assurance Company by way of collateral security the three several insurances policies hereinbefore referred to; that the said mortgage to the Canada Life Assurance Company was paid off by the defendants out of the moneys advanced upon the security of their said mortgage, and the defendants obtained an assignment thereof, and of their charge on the said life policies, from the Canada Life Assurance Company by way of collateral security for their mortgage hereinbefore mentioned; that the plaintiffs, before the commencement of this action, tendered to the defendants the sum of $120 in payment of the amount due to them under the assignment in the statement of claim mentioned, and also tendered to the defendants a re-assignment of the policies for execution and demanded possession of the policies, but the defendants refused to accept that sum or to give up possession thereof; and that the plaintiffs are entitled to redeem the policies, and to the possession thereof, and to have the same re-assigned to them on payment of the sum of $96.73.\nFrom this report the present appellants appealed, assigning the following grounds of appeal:\n1st. That the official referee should have allowed the defendants interest on their mortgage security at the rate mentioned in the mortgage from the date of the mortgage until actual payment, both because such rate is so reserved and made payable by the mortgage and because the evidence shows that, subsequent to the expiration of the term for payment fixed by the mortgage, the plaintiffs agreed to pay such rate if the immediate payment of the mortgage money was not enforced, and because, in any event, the defendants would be entitled to interest at the rate reserved in the mortgage as damages for breach of contract in not paying the same as therein reserved.\n2nd. On the ground that the plaintiffs, other than Alexander Grant, have no interest in the policies, and that the said Alexander Grant is precluded from redeeming them by his contract.\n3rd. Because the evidence shows that, as between the parties to the action, the mortgage to the Canada Life Assurance Company is still unsatisfied, and that the policies in question are held by the defendants as security therefor.\nThis appeal having come on to be heard before the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas Division that learned judge, on the 27th September, 1889, gave judgment dismissing the appeal with costs. From this order the appellants then appealed to the Court of Appeal, by which latter court the appeal was also dismissed with costs. From this last order the present appeal has been brought.\nThe declaration of 2nd August, 1877, made by Alexander Grant by endorsement on the policies, clearly had the effect attributed to it by the referee in his report of vesting the policies and the monies thereby assigned absolutely in the respondents other than Alexander Grant in the event, which has occurred, of Mrs. Grant\u2019s death. The original enactment which was in force at the date of the endorsed declaration, and of which sec. 5 of ch. 136 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1887, is a reproduction, provides that such a declaration shall be deemed a trust for the children according to the interest expressed or declared, and that so long as any object of the trust remains, the money payable under the policy shall not be subject to the control of the father or his creditors, or form part of his estate when the sum secured by the policy becomes payable. It follows from this that no dealings with the policies by Alexander Grant and his wife subsequent in date to the 2nd of August, 1877, can in any way prejudice or affect the rights of their children, the other respondents, and that in this respect the finding of the referee is unimpeachable. Therefore, as against the respondents other than Alexander Grant, the appellants are not entitled to a charge upon these policies more extensive than that which was imposed by the mortgage of the 13th of June, 1877, in favor of the Canada Life Assurance Company, and all charges and dispositions of the policies by Alexander Grant subsequently made are inoperative and void as against the respondents other than himself. The last named parties were, therefore, strictly entitled to redeem and have a re-assignment of these policies upon payment to the appellants of the original mortgage debt to the Canada Life Assurance Company of $6,000, together with interest calculated according to the terms of the proviso contained in the mortgage deed, together with any premiums on the policies which may have been paid by the mortgagees, and any proper allowances in respect of costs and expenses\u2014less the amount of payments made by the mortgagors to the original mortgagees, and less a due and ratable proportion of the purchase money received from the sale of the lands and of the payments made by the mortgagors to the appellants. The referee has not, however, taken the account on this principle, but according to the terms of the appellants\u2019 mortgage of 1881, which was less favorable to the respondents (other than Alexander Grant) than the principle of accounting to which they were in strictness entitled. They have not, however, appealed from the referee\u2019s decision.\nThe learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas Division, and the Court of Appeal rest their respective decisions on the authority of the cases of Powell v. Peck[14] and St. John v. Rykert[15], and in the former case of Powell v. Peck the Court of Appeal followed the deci- sion of this court in St. John v. Rykert. In St. John v. Rykert it was held that upon a promissory note by which interest was reserved at the rate of 24 per cent. per annum \u201cuntil paid,\u201d interest at the rate so reserved was not recoverable by way of damages after the day of payment, and that from that time interest could only be recovered at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum. This decision was founded on the case of The European Central Railway Company[16], and upon the explanation and approval of it by Mr. Justice Fry in the later case of Popple v. Sylvester[17]. See also re Roberts[18]. Mr. Justice Fry in the last named case distinguished it from that of The European Central Railway Company as follows, he says:\u2014\nI ought perhaps to make a remark upon the case of The European Central Railway Company. There the covenant being to pay the principal sum with interest until repayment thereof the court held that these words meant until the day fixed for payment, and therefore they held that there was no covenant to pay beyond the day fixed for repayment of the principal. Here I have held that there is an express covenant to continue the payment of interest so long as the security should continue. That case therefore has no application.\nThe material words of the debentures in question in the case of European Central Railway Company were \u201cthe principal sum to be paid on the 11th day of October, 1865, and the interest to be payable in the meantime half-yearly until the repayment thereof[19].\u201d Following the case of the European Central Railway Company and Mr. Justice Fry\u2019s comment on it, it was determined in St. John v. Rykert that the words \u201cuntil paid\u201d were equivalent to the expression \u201cuntil repayment\u201d in the case in the English Court of Appeal. In Powell v. Peck14 interest was reserved at 8 per cent. per annum \u201cuntil payment in full.\u201d Proudfoot J. allowed interest by way of damages at 6 per cent. only, after the day fixed for payment, and the Court of Appeal unanimously refused to interfere with his decision, holding that interest was only payable under the contract up to the date fixed for payment of principal, and that the rate of subsequent interest allowed by way of damages was discretionary and ought not to be interfered with. This case is valuable for a very able discussion of the principles involved and a full examination of the authorities contained in the judgments of Mr. Justice Burton and Mr. Justice Osler. For myself, I agree with the rule as to interest by way of damages there laid down except in one respect. I cannot assent to the suggestion of Mr. Justice Osler (not, however, acted on in the case under consideration) that in foreclosure and redemption actions more than 6 per cent. might be given by way of damages. Creditors have it in their power to stipulate for liquidated damages in case of default, and in my opinion if they do not do so they must, in the silence of their contract, be content with the statutory rate of 6 per cent which, in the face of the express enactment of the statute, is not to be exceeded unless a larger rate of subsequent interest is actually contracted for. The defeasance clause in the mortgage of 1881 on the footing of which the referee seems to have taken the account, is that the \u201cmortgage should \u201cbe void on payment on or before the 1st of June, \u201c1884, with interest thereon at the rate of 10 per cent. \u201cper annum until such principal and interest shall be \u201cfully paid and satisfied.\u201d I entirely agree with the Court of Appeal and the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas Division that no sensible distinction can be made between these words and those used in the English case referred to, and in St. John v. Rykert and Powell v. Peck; the words in the last case in particular \u201cuntil payment in full\u201d being the exact equivalent of those used in the present case.\nAs I have before indicated, however, the mortgage to the Canada Life Assurance Company of the 31st May, 1877, is that which alone can affect the children of. Mr. Grant who claim under the statutory declaration endorsed on the policies, and the defeasance clause in that instrument is expressed even more strongly in favor of the respondents than that in the appellants\u2019 own mortgage. In this first mortgage the proviso reads: \u201cProvided this mortgage to be void on payment of $6,000 with interest at 8 per cent., as follows: the said principal sum of $6,000 at the expiration of one year from the date hereof, with interest in the meantime payable half-yearly.\u201d The words, \u201cin the meantime,\u201d here used, bring this case exactly within the terms of the debentures in the case of The European Central Railway Company, and are conclusive to show that there was no contract to pay interest ultra the day fixed lor payment of the principal.\nThe case before us is, therefore, a much stronger one for restricting the recovery of interest at the stipulated rate to the day fixed for payment of the principal than any up to this time before the Ontario courts.\nSince the foregoing portion of this judgment was written my attention has been called by the appellants\u2019 counsel to the case of Mellersh v. Brown[20]. I have read the report of that case, and after the most careful and attentive consideration I have been able to give it it appears to me that so far as it has any bearing at all on the present case it is an authority for the respondents rather than for the appellants. The principal question in Mellersh v. Brown was whether the mortgagee of a reversionary interest in personal property was to be restricted to a recovery of arrears of interest for six years in analogy to that provision of the statute of limitations which prescribes that in the case of money charged on land the mortgagee or chargee shall be limited to six years\u2019 arrears. It was held that no such analogy could prevail, a decision which has no application whatever to the question we have to deal with in the present appeal. There is nothing in the judgment in this case of Mellersh v. Brown touching the question raised in the appeal before us beyond this: The learned judge who decided that case, Mr. Justice Kay, held that interest subsequent to the day fixed for payment, and, therefore, recoverable only by way of damages, was to be at the rate of 5 per cent., not, however, because that was the rate reserved by the mortgage deed, but because it was the usual and current mercantile rate of interest. So far, therefore, the case is a strong authority for the respondents here. In England there is no statutory provision as to the rate of interest, except as to judgment debts which, by statute 1 & 2 Vic., c. 110, sec. 17, are to bear interest at 4 per cent. per annum. Here, however, we have the statute (now R.S.C. c. 127, sec. 2) fixing the rate of interest in all cases where interest is recoverable, and where by the contract a rate is not expressly stipulated for, at 6 per cent. per annum. The words of this enactment are clear:\nWhenever interest is payable by agreement of the parties or by law, and no rate is fixed by such agreement or by law, the rate of interest shall be six per cent. per annum.\nIt follows that interest recoverable by way of damages in this country cannot exceed a yearly rate of six per cent.\nFurther, this case of Mellersh v. Brown is an authority, if any can be required in addition to the cases before cited, that when by the contract interest is stipulated for up to a certain day fixed for payment of the principal the contract is not to be considered as providing by implication for the payment of subsequent interest at the same rate.\nIt is true that the judgment in the case of Mellersh v. Brown contains certain dicta from which it might, perhaps be inferred that the rule restricting subsequent interest to the current mercantile rate would not apply to a suit for redemption, and the learned judge certainly does quote the dictum of Lord Justice Cotton in re Roberts having reference to the same point. That, however, can have no application in the present case for the reason already mentioned, that we are here bound by a statute which prescribes an absolute rate for such cases which cannot be exceeded. Further, the case of Cook v. Fowler, the appeal in which embraced two causes one of which was a redemption suit, and the note to Mounson v. Redshaw[21] seem to have escaped observation. According to the last of these authorities the rule that interest post diem solutionis is recoverable only by way of damages is said to apply as well to money secured by a mortgage deed as to other contracts reserving interest payable at a day certain; and it results from Cook v. Fowler that no distinction is to be made between redemption suits and actions or proceedings instituted by the creditor for the recovery of the debt. And in the face of the well established principle that the price of redemption is to be the same in a redemption as in a foreclosure suit[22], it would be difficult if the case turned on that to maintain that there was any foundation for the distinction suggested. It is sufficient, however, for the present purpose, to say that in the Province of Ontario the rate of subsequent interest recoverable by way of damages is fixed by the statute at six per cent., and that that rate cannot therefore be exceeded.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I only add in concurrence with this judgment of Mr. Justice Strong that it is, in my opinion, too plain to admit of any argument to the contrary that there is no covenant in the mortgage in question for payment of any interest beyond the day named in the proviso for avoiding the mortgage by payment of the principal, and that, therefore, beyond that day interest given as damages must be governed by the statute referred to by my brother Strong.\nPATTERSON J. concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Delamere, Reesor, English & Ross.\nSolicitors for respondents: Beck & Code.\n[1] 17 Ont.

Ritchie C.J., and Strong, Taschereau, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nArbitration and award\u2014Award made final by submission\u2014Motion to set aside\u2014Grounds of objection.\nAn award will not be set aside on the ground that a memo., furnished by the arbitrator to the losing party after its publication, showed that the accounts between the parties were adjusted upon a wrong principle, the defect, if any, not being a mistake on the face of the award or in some paper forming part of, and incorporated with, the award, and there being no admission by the arbitrator himself that he had made a mistake.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] and refusing to set aside an award in favor of Lemay & Son.\nThe facts of this case are fully set out in the reports of the decisions appealed from. The following statement contains all that is necessary for the purposes of this report:\u2014 McRae & Co. were contractors with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for the construction of certain pile and trestle bridges on the line of the railway east of Port Arthur, on the north shore of Lake Superior and Lemay & Son were sub-contractors for the construction of portions of the same work. After the contract was completed a dispute arose between McRae & Co.s and the railway company in reference to the quantity of timber supplied under the contract, the difficulty arising from the use of the term \u201cboard measure\u201d as the basis of payment. This dispute ended in a suit against the company which was settled during the trial, and the present suit was brought in which the same contest arose as to what was meant by \u201cboard measure.\u201d In this suit the parties agreed on a reference to arbitration, and a submission was signed which referred \u201cto the arbitration, award and final end and determination of George H. MacDonnell,\u201d all matters of account and counter-claim in the action in question, and all matters in difference between the parties E.F. Lemay & Son, and John A. McRae & Company. The arbitration resulted in an award being made in favor of Lemay & Son.\nMcRae & Co. moved to set aside the award on the grounds of the improper admission of evidence of verbal agreements varying the contract between the parties, of wrong computation by the arbitrator to ascertain the amount due the plaintiffs and not awarding payment on the basis of board measure, and of the discovery of new evidence. The affidavits in support of the motion stated that after the award was published the solicitor of McRae & Co. had a conversation with the arbitrator who informed him that a written memo, which he produced, showed his reasons for the different findings in his award, and how he arrived at the figures and results stated therein, but that he had not published these reasons as his decision was to be final. It was claimed in support of the motion that this memo showed that the arbitrator had proceeded on a wrong principle in making up the accounts between the parties and also that he had departed from his original intention as to his award.\nIn support of the ground of the discovery of new evidence taken in the motion, the affidavits stated that an important witness had been sick during the progress of the hearing before the arbitrator, and it was only ascertained a day or two before the motion was made that material evidence could be given by another person who had not been called as a witness.\nThe application to set aside the award was refused by the Divisional Court, and the decision of that court was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. From the latter decision an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nChristopher Robinson, Q.C., and A. Ferguson, Q.C., for the appellants, cited the following authorities: In re Dare Valley Railway Co.[3]; East and West India Docks Co. v. Kirk[4]; James v. James[5]; Kent v. Elstob[6].\nS.H. Blake Q.C., and Keefer for the respondents referred to Dinn v. Blake[7], Ching v. Ching[8], Flynn v. Robertson[9], Hogg v. Burgess[10], Doed. Oxenden v. Cropper[11].\nSIR W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014This was a voluntary submission, without any provision therein for an appeal from the award; the reference could scarcely be larger, \u201cthe said action and all matters of account and counter claim therein, and all matters in difference between the parties.\u201d The case of Hodgkinson v. Fernie[12], clearly enunciates the law that where matters in difference are referred to an arbitrator he is constituted the sole and final judge of all questions both of law and fact, the exceptions to the rule being cases where the award is the result of corruption or fraud, or where the question of law arises on the face of the award or upon some paper accompanying and forming part of the award, which is approved of in Dinn v. Blake[13], where another exception is stated, viz.: where the arbitrator himself admits that there is a mistake, which, in the case before us, the arbitrator does not admit.\nThe award is good on its face. The draft award or memo relied on handed to the defendant\u2019s solicitor, was neither delivered with the award, nor did it form any part of it. Neither this draft award nor the oral admissions of the arbitrators can be used for setting aside the award.\nThis is not the case of an application to revoke the submission. See Dinn v. Blake13, Leggo v. Young[14].\nI agree with the reasons given by Mr. Chief Justice Armour for refusing to set this award aside, and also with him that no proper case is made for remitting the award to the arbitrators on the ground of the discovery of new evidence.\nFor the reasons given, and on the authorities cited by Chief Justice Armour and Mr. Justice Osler, I think the decision in the court below correct, and that this appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This is an appeal against an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming an order of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, refusing a motion to set aside an award upon the ground of mistake on the part of the arbitrator.\nIn my opinion there is no foundation whatever for the appeal.\nNothing in the law relating to arbitrations and awards is better established than the rule that the court will not set aside or otherwise interfere with an award on the ground of mistake in the arbitrator either as regards the law or the facts, except in certain well defined cases.\nThese exceptions are, first, where the mistake appears on the face of the award, or in some paper which forms part of the award and is by reference incorporated with it. Secondly, in cases where the arbitrator himself states:\nThat in his opinion he has made a mistake of law or fact and was desirous of the assistance of the court, and willing to reserve his decision on the point on which he believed himself to have gone wrong.\nFor the first of these rules, the authority of the cases of Hodgkinson v. Fernie[15]; Dinn v. Blake[16]; Flynn v. Robertson[17]; Holgate v. Killick[18]; Re London Dock Company v. Trustees of Shadwell[19], may be quoted. For the second position besides the before mentioned cases of Dinn v. Blake17, and Flynn v. Robertson18; Mills v. The Master, etc. of the Mystery of Bowyers[20], may be referred to.\nIn the present case there is nothing on the face of the award or in any paper forming part of it showing any mistake, nor has any mistake been admitted by the arbitrator. It has been attempted to demonstrate that there has been a mistake by producing a draft award which the arbitrator, after he had published his award, handed to the appellants\u2019 solicitor and by arguing from what there appears that the arbitrator must have been mistaken, and also by an affidavit of the appellants\u2019 solicitor of what was stated to him by the arbitrator after the publication of the award. These are totally insufficient grounds for interfering with the award. In Lockwoody v. Smith[21] Martin B. says:\nThere must be some grounds given us to suppose that the arbitrator is satisfied that there has been a mistake.\nNothing before us indicates that the arbitrator in the present case is under any such impression or that he thinks he has in any respect committed an error; for all that appears to the contrary if the award was now referred back to him he would again make one exactly similar.\nIf any illustration of the wisdom of the rule referred to could be required it would be afforded by the course which was taken on the argument of the present appeal which resolved itself into nothing less than an appeal at large from the arbitrator\u2019s decision on the law and facts; therefore to entertain such an application would be, in effect, to supersede altogether the functions of the arbitrator whose arbitrament the parties had agreed should be final.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons given by his Lordship the Chief Justice.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Concurred.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I cannot see my way to hold the appellant entitled to be relieved from the award of which he complains.\nThe submission is by an order made by consent of parties in an action in which the present respondents are plaintiffs and the appellants defendants. There is no agreement contained in the submission that the award shall be subject to appeal under the Ontario Statute, and there is no motion to refer back the award to the arbitrator for reconsideration. The present motion is merely to set aside the award.\nThe appellants were contractors with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for the construction of a part of the railway. The respondents were sub-contractors under them for the construction of certain pile and trestle bridges, and they were to be paid\u2014with some exceptions which do not effect this contract\u2014a price per thousand feet (board measure) for the timber, round or flatted, put into the work. The price covered the work of construction as well as the supplying of the timber, which was to be procured along the line where practicable and within reasonable hauling distance.\nThe dispute is over the amount awarded to the respondents, which the plaintiff alleges to be more than a measurement of the timber by \u201cboard measure\u201d will justify.\nThe award adjudges that the respondents are indebted to the plaintiffs in $9,900.52, without giving any details as to how that sum is arrived at, but the arbitrator had at one time intended to have made his award in a different shape, and had prepared a draft award giving full details of the process by which the result of $9,900.52 was reached. That draft was afterwards seen by the parties or their solicitors and is brought before the court with an affidavit showing how it was obtained and stating conversations with the arbitrator.\nIt is objected on the part of the respondent that under the established law relating to motions to set aside awards that are good on their face, the draft award and the conversations mentioned in the affidavit cannot properly be taken into consideration by the court. To decide that objection would involve a discussion of some questions of fact as well as of law, including a divergence in one or two particulars between the arbitrator and the respondents\u2019 solicitor in their accounts or their understanding of the conversations, &c., referred to in the affidavits filed. In my judgment that discussion is unnecessary, because I think that, even with all the materials presented by the appellant before us, we must agree with the courts below in holding that the arbitrator did not exceed his jurisdiction.\nThe term \u201cboard measure\u201d is not one that explains itself. It is shown to be a term in use among lumbermen, and among them to denote the number of square feet of 1-inch boards which a log of given length and diameter is estimated to be capable of producing. Mr. Pinkerton, a partner in the appellant firm and himself an engineer, speaks of it in his evidence, and he seems to show that a lumberman would probably make his estimate by means of Scribner\u2019s tables, though the actual yield might vary according to the thickness of the saw. One of his answers is:\nI have looked over Scribner; he gives a table, and it is pretty hard to arrive at a rule, because some saws are thicker than others, as a band saw will not waste as much as a circular saw, so there could not be any rule on that point.\nThe appellants by no means conceded that \u201cboard measure\u201d according to Scribner\u2019s tables satisfied their contract with the railway company. They claimed the cubic contents of each piece of timber, and the company\u2019s engineers measured and certified on that basis. The company insisted on \u201cboard measure\u201d by the lumbermen\u2019s scale, which, as Mr. Pinkerton explains, is much less than the cubic contents of the log, because you lose the slabs and saw cut.\nOn this dispute the appellants brought an action against the company which was compromised during the trial without a decision on the meaning of \u201cboard measure\u201d in these contracts.\nThe respondents claimed against the appellants another mode of computation, at least as to a considerable part of their work. They had three contracts, each for a different section of the railway. On one section there was timber available to supply the sizes, 12 inches square being the largest required. There is no difference between the measurements by which the respondents claimed and those of the appellants on that section. The same thing is said to be true of the first forty miles of the second section, but after that the available timber was smaller, and smaller sizes than the company\u2019s contract required were used and accepted by the company\u2019s engineers. It is, as I understand, with regard to these smaller timbers that the principal dispute exists. The respondents were not satisfied to be allowed merely the cubic contents of each stick, and of course were farther from submitting to the lumbermen\u2019s board measure. Their claim was for the full sizes of timbers required by the contract, although smaller sizes were used and accepted. As expressed by one of the Lemay family in his evidence before the arbitrator\u2014\nThe timber that was used as 12 by 12 was measured 12 feet to the running foot; timber used as 8 by 12 was measured at 8 feet to the running foot.\nThe dispute as to this made of computation was one of the matters in difference referred to the arbitrator. He does not appear to have adopted the respondents\u2019 method of making their computations. He takes their measurements which were made as just noticed, and says:\nBut from the evidence I am satisfied that a large percentage of the timber measured as 12 inches in diameter was not that size. In fact John W. Lemay says in his evidence that some of it was not more than 9 inches in diameter at the small end. For me to arrive at the exact amount that should have been allowed it would be necessary to have all the bridges re-measured. This is an impossibility, as many of the structures have already been filled in with earth by the railway company, and to do what I consider fair and right between the parties a deduction of 30 per cent. should be made from the above figures in the measurements made by plaintiff\u2019s witnesses Beauvais and Lemay.\nThen he gives the figures which bring out the amount of the award. In doing this he makes the deduction of 30 per cent., not from measurements of Beauvais and Lemay but from the excess of their measurements over those put in on behalf of the appellants. I do not understand that to be an error as was urged at the bar. I understand the error to be in failing to express his meaning clearly. There are three reasons for so thinking. There is first the arbitrator\u2019s own figures. Then there is the fact that to deduct 30 per cent. from the gross measurements would reduce the measurements below those of the respondent; and lastly there is the affidavit of the solicitor who obtained the draft award and who talked the matter over with the arbitrator. He says the arbitrator\u2014\nfurther stated to me that he considered there was no evidence whatever before him as to what system of measurements was, or was to be, adopted on the second and third contracts except the evidence of Ross and Lemay, and that as the work was all filled in, and he could not discover the actual measurements, he was obliged to dispose of the question of measurement of timber without any evidence and according to his own ideas of right and justice, and that he accordingly took Lemay\u2019s measurement, allowing thirty per cent. off the excess or difference between Lemay\u2019s and McRae\u2019s claims to make up for the fact that Lemay admitted that part of the timber was only nine inches in diameter.\nI have carefully examined the cases cited to us and a number of others, and I do not see that either on authority or on principle we should be warranted in setting this award aside.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: A.

Judgment was obtained against the said firm but was not registered so as to bind their real estate, and other creditors having also obtained, and registered, judgments against the same parties the real estate was all taken to satisfy them and the plaintiff was unable to obtain his money, and he brought an action against the solicitor to recover the amount of his judgment as damages for negligence in not registering.\nOn the trial the issue mainly turned upon whether or not the solicitor had received special instructions to register. The plaintiff's agent, who had originally instructed the defendant, swore that when told by the defendant that judgment had been signed he asked if he could get the money and was told that he could not, that nothing could be done except register the judgment against the property. He asked if that made any difference and was told that if he did not register he could not get the money after the property was sold, whereupon he said \" if that's the case have it registered.\" A few days after he saw the defendant again and asked if the judgment was registered and the defendant said that it was.\nThe defendant did not deny the truth of this statement by the agent but thought that the first conversation took place after the other judgments had been registered against the firm of Kwong Lee & Co. and, therefore, too late to carry out the instructions. The agent, on the other hand, swore positively that it was in time.\nThe trial judge, in his charge to the jury, stated as his opinion that the original retainer of the defendant made it his duty to take the necessary steps to obtain the fruits of it, but he left to them the question whether or not special instructions had been given with respect to it. The jury found for the plaintiff with damages to the amount of the judgment debt. The defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nPrior to the obtaining of the p\u00ecaintiff\u00a7s judgment a receiver had been appointed to the estate of Kwong, Lee & Co. in a suit between two of the partners. The defendant contended before the court below that as the assets would have to be distributed ratably by the receiver the omission to register the judgment was immaterial.\nChrysler for the appellant.

Ricknell[7].\nAs to burden of proof see Re Kerr[8].\nChristopher Robinson Q.C. for the respondent cited Plant v. Pearman[9], and Harrington v. Binns[10].\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014There can be no doubt that an attorney is liable for negligence in the discharge of his duty whereby his client has sustained damage, and I think an attorney is bound to bring to the exercise of his profession a reasonable amount of knowledge, skill and care in connection with the business of his client. It is quite clear in this case that there was no want of knowledge, because it is equally clear that the attorney well understood the necessity and value of the registration of this judgment and undertook to have it done, and lulled the client into a false security by telling him that he had done it, whereas, in fact, he most negligently and carelessly, without any apparent excuse, has failed to do what he had undertaken, whereby the client has lost the amount of his judgment which the evidence clearly shows would have been secured to him if the attorney had done his duty and registered the judgment as he was instructed and undertook to do.\nNo question arises in this case as to the retainer ceasing with the judgment. I think the question necessary to establish the defendant's liability was substantially left to the jury ; the jury were fully justified in arriving at the conclusion that the attorney distinctly undertook to register the judgment and that he stated that he believed this had been done when, in point of fact, he had entirely neglected to do so. He had registered a judgment for another client after the date of the Pun Pong judgment, which registration secured the payment of the former judgment, showing conclusively that the loss of the amount of the Pun Pong judgment resulted from his omission and negligence.\nUnder these circumstances I think the judgment of the court below was quite right, and this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia impugned in this appeal was in all respects right and that it must be affirmed.\nA good deal was said in the course of the argument in the court below about an order for a receiver granted in a suit of Fan v. Fan, which was a partnership suit between the partners composing the firm of Kwong, Lee & Co., the defendants in the action which the appellant was retained by the respondent to prosecute, and about the effect of that order for a receiver on the priority of judgment creditors and their right to be paid out of the debtor's lands according to the order in point of date of their registration. It requires no demonstration to show that all this had nothing to do with the matters in dispute. No order or decree in the suit of Fan v. Fan could possibly affect creditors of Kwong, Lee & Co., who were not parties to the partnership suit, and it is preposterous to talk of the lands of the partnership being made equitable assets as regards judgment creditors of the firm. The court below were, therefore, right in disregarding this argument.\nThe real questions in the case are : First, whether in point of law a retainer of the appellant to bring the action did or did not make it his duty to register the judgment. And if this is to be answered in the negative then : Secondly, did, or did not, Nee Mook, the agent for the respondent, give the appellant the special instructions to register which he swears he did give ? It appears to me that both these questions must be answered favorably to the respondent. Upon the evidence of Mr. Prevost there can be no doubt that if the respondent's judgment had been registered prior to the registration of the judgment for $46,214 recovered by Goetz's against Kwong, Lee & Co., and registered on the 21st July, 1886, it would have been paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the lands of the judgment debtors.\nIt is, however, insisted that a retainer to prosecute the action did not make it the duty of the appellant to register the judgment, and for this the case of Darling v. Webber[11] is relied on as an authority. That case, however, so far as the point actually decided in it goes, does not support the appellant's contention ; the question there was not as to the duty of the attorney who recovered the judgment to register it but as to his duty to re-register at the expiration of the statutory period when the original registration was vacated by the lapse of time. It was held it was not the duty of the attorney so to re-register This may, however, well be consistently with its being the duty of the attorney to effect registration originally on the recovery of the judgment. It is true that there are dicta contained in the judgment of Darling v. Webber which, emanating from a court of such high authority as that which decided that case, are entitled to the most respectful consideration. I am of opinion, however, that consistently with the authorities it cannot be held that a retainer to prosecute an action to judgment terminates with the recovery of the judgment, nor that such a retainer does not by itself make it the duty of the attorney or solicitor without further instruction to proceed after judgment and endeavor to obtain the fruits of the recovery.\nIn Lady de la Pole v. Dick[12] it was held that solicitors continued to represent their client after judgment, without any further retainer, for the purpose of appealing against the judgment, and this decision proceeded upon the principle that the retainer of the solicitor does not terminate with the judgment but continues thereafter, in the case of the solicitor of the party recovering the judgment for the purpose of obtaining the fruits of it, and in the case of the solicitor of the party condemned by it for the purpose of defending him against the execution. The authority on which this decision proceeded seems to have been an old case of Laurence v. Harrison reported in Styles[13] where Rolle C.J. propounds the law in the terms just stated. In Bevins v. Holme[14] the law is stated by Parke B. as follows:\u2014\nWe think he was right in contending that the original retainer was not determined by the judgment but continued afterwards so as to warrant the attorney in issuing execution within a year and a day or afterwards in continuation of a former writ of execution issued within that time, and also to warrant his receiving the damages without a writ of execution, the weight of prior authority being against the decision of Heath J. in Tipping v. Johnson[15].\nAnd in two passages in Lush's practice[16] which, as well as the before mentioned authorities, were cited by counsel arguendo in De la Pole v. Dick[17], we have the high authority of the late Lord Justice Lush in favor of the view that the retainer continues until the judgment is satisfied, and for holding that the case of Tipping v. Johnson[18] to the contrary must be considered as no longer of authority. The cases of Plant v. Pearman[19] and Harrington v. Binns[20] cited in the respondent's factum also support the same conclusion.\nIf the rule to be deduced from these cases and authorities is now the law in England I think it ought, a fortiori, to be considered as applicable here. When a client retains a solicitor to collect a debt he makes no distinction between the services required for that end before judgment and those to be rendered after judgment ; the retainer is, in the view of the client, not merely to establish the right by bringing the action and recovering the judgment, stopping there, but to get the money. What is expected of the solicitor is that he should do just what the witness (Nee Mook) says he told Mr. Hett, the appellant, he wanted him to do in the present instance, viz., in the words of the witness, \"attend to the case.\" And attending to the case, in my opinion, would, even if the English authorities were not as decisive as they are, include the perfecting of the judgment as a charge on the judgment debtor's lands by registering it in any county or other division for registration purposes in which there might be reasonable grounds for presuming that the judgment debtor had lands,\nBut even if the original retainer had not made it the duty of the appellant to register the respondent would still have been entitled to retain the judgment in his favor now impeached, inasmuch as it is plain from the evidence upon which the jury, under the direction of the learned judge who presided at the trial, found for the respondent that the appellant received special instructions from Nee Mook, the respondent's agent, to register the judgment. The witness, Nee Mook, says that this was soon after the judgment was recovered and, therefore, sometime anterior to registering Goetz's judgment. Mr. Hett, the appellant, cannot fix the date of these instructions but thinks it was too late. It is clear, however, that any presumption as regards the date must be against the appellant. It was his duty as a solicitor to keep proper books containing regular records of the proceedings in cases which he was conducting as a solicitor, and as the agent representing the client swears to a particular date it does not lie in the mouth of the solicitor to say he cannot recollect the date of the instructions and that he has no entry to refer to from which it can be accurately ascertained. The appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014It is to be regretted that any question as to whether the original retainer of a solicitor by a client to commence an action for the recovery of a debt involves an undertaking by the solicitor to register the judgment when recovered in the office for registration of titles affecting lands for the purpose of charging the judgment upon the lands if any there be, of the judgment debtor, was ever introduced into this case for, as pointed out by Mr. Justice Gray in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, that question was not raised upon the record. The allegation of the plaintiff in his state- ment of claim was that after the recovery of the judgment the plaintiff gave his solicitor express instructions to register the judgment, and that the solicitor in disregard of such instructions neglected to do so whereby the plaintiff suffered damage. The defendant, in his statement of defence, expressly denied that allegation, and he denied that he ever was instructed to register the judgment. He denied also that the plaintiff had, by any negligence of the defendant, lost the fruits of his judgment, or that if the judgment had been registered the plaintiff would have recovered the amount, or that the plaintiff had suffered any damage from the non-registration thereof. Upon issue joined on these points the case went down to trial, and the whole of the evidence offered by the plaintiff thereat was addressed to the establishment of this special instruction alleged to have been given to the solicitor after the recovery of the judgment, and of his undertaking to comply with such instruction and his subsequent assurance that he had, in fact, done so. That the learned judge who tried the case was of opinion that the original retainer to bring the action did involve an undertaking by the solicitor, and did impose upon him the duty to register the judgment when obtained, appears clearly from his judgment pronounced upon the plaintiff's motion for judgment after verdict; and that he expressed that opinion in his charge to the jury also abundantly appears, I think, from that charge as reported on the appeal case before us ; but that the case was not left to the jury as resting upon that expression of the learned judge's view of the law appears also from the remainder of the charge. If the case had been rested upon the learned judge's opinion of the law upon that point there would have been nothing to leave to the jury but the question of damages, if any, which may have been sustained by the plaintiff, whereas it appears, by the report of what took place at the trial, that the whole contention was as to the truth of the allegation of the plaintiff in his statement of claim that the defendant had been specially instructed, after the judgment had been obtained, to register it, and upon this point the learned judge charged the jury as follows :\u2014\nIt strikes me, if you believe the evidence of the Chinaman, that he did get the suggestion to register from Mr. Hett. Mr. Hett confirms this as far as his memory goes, though it appears to be very unsettled upon some points, except as to the general idea, so forcibly pressed on us by his counsel, as to the necessity of doing what was expected of him.\nWell, this Chinaman learned from Mr. Hett, when the judgment was obtained, he could not get the amount of his judgment until after the property had been sold, and then, he swears distinctly, registration was mentioned. Mr. Hett himself says he mentioned registration to him. If this did take place at that time then clearly there was a dereliction of duty on Mr. Hett's part for which he is liable in damages ; but if you find that the evidence does not amount to that, though it appears to me to do so, you are sole judges of the fact. Though I give you an impression of my opinion, if it does not coincide with your own judgment you are to pay no attention to mine, but your duty in such case is to act entirely on your own conviction. A man ought not, in that view, to undertake the work if he can see that it would not succeed, or if he does not see some reasonable chance of its succeeding. Nor does the evidence show you whether if the judgment had been registered at that time it would have succeeded or not. Are you or are you not satisfied, from the receiver's evidence, that if he had registered it, when it was got, against the real estate he would have got the money? That is before you, mind, for the purpose of ascertaining your conclusion. If upon the evidence you are of that opinion then I think it was a dereliction of duty not to have registered the judgment.\nAnd again:\nThe defendant must have thought that there was some advantage in registering the judgment in the Law Registry office which would ensue to the benefit of his client from his having told Nee Mook he had done so. If he really did so at the time he is said to have done so, he must have thought there was an advantage in it that would accrue to the benefit of his client. I can easily imagine, and I should wish no word I say to carry more weight than it deserves, but it is very conceiv- able and easy to imagine that a gentleman of the occupation and business of the defendant in this case, not having been in the habit of keeping a diary, might easily not be able to charge his memory specially with the dates and times at which these important conversations are stated to have taken place.\nThat they did take place at the times stated, it is for you to say ; but if they did take place at the time, then the obligation he was under to see after the registration of this judgment was binding at that time upon him. The learned counsel for the defence says it could only have been after notice of the sale, and several other things, that registration was suggested, and that it was then too late. Is that reasonable? Does it strike you in the face of the evidence as a proper point to take?\nNow there can, I think, be no doubt that the case was thus distinctly left to the jury as resting upon the truth or falsity of the evidence of the Chinaman, Nee Mook, who had sworn very distinctly as to the time, and as to the conversations between him and the defendant when the special and precise instructions to register the judgment were given by Nee Mook as agent of the plaintiff to the defendant, and the performance of the instructions was undertaken by him. As to the evidence of this Chinaman the defendant himself said that he would not swear that it was incorrect, although he had no recollection of it. And again he said:\nI do not think I told him anything but that I would register, or told him I had registered.\nAnd again he said:\nI keep no diary as to interviews or attendances; nothing to refresh my memory as to this case.\nAnd again:\nI speak only from recollection.\nNow, upon this evidence there cannot be any doubt that the jury had sufficient to justify their adopting the evidence of the Chinaman, nor do I think there can be any doubt that it was upon his evidence they rendered their verdict, and I cannot think that the expression of opinion by the learned judge of the extent of the first retainer to bring the action operated to induce them to render their verdict as founded upon that opinion, and not upon the evidence of the Chinaman, to which their attention was so directly drawn both during the whole progress of the taking of the evidence and by the charge of the learned judge. It would, I think, have been better that no expression of opinion upon the point had been given, as it was quite unnecessary in the case, for although it be admitted that the original retainer is not exhausted by entering judgment it may well be still a question whether it involves the duty of registering the judgment in the land registry office, which, if it be a duty, might result in involving the client in great and unnecessary expense, as for example if it should appear that the judgment debtor had no lands to be affected by such registration. However, I express no opinion upon the point, as it is not necessary that I should\u2014it must still remain an open question. All that it is necessary to decide in the present case is, that I do not think there is shown any such probability of the jury's attention having been withdrawn from the real point in issue, or that in rendering their verdict they were influenced by the judge's expression of opinion instead of by the evidence upon the point which was actually in issue to call for a new trial.\nThat the damage was sufficiently proved, there can be no doubt, if the special retainer to register was established, as I think we must, upon the evidence, hold that it was. The case will be a warning to the defendant not to act in the future so loosely as he admits he has been in the habit of doing in matters of such importance, not only to his clients, but to himself.\nI think the appeal must be dismissed, and with costs. PATTERSON J.\u2014I also am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014I wish to make an observation in respect to the duty of solicitors to register judgments independent of instructions, having had a large experience in New Brunswick, and knowing that in that province there are certain expenses connected with such registration as a judgment would have to be registered in every county. In my office a judgment was never registered unless information was given by the client that there was property in a particular county, but execution was issued within a year and a day.\nIn this case I think the solicitor had special instructions to register the judgment which was the reason I did not make these observations before.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for Appellant: J.P.

(1887) c. 53 s. 37\u2014Reference back to arbitrators for re-consideration and re\u2011determination.\nIn the Province of Ontario the governing statute as to the time for applying to set aside an award which has been made under a rule of court, or to remit it to the arbitrators for re\u2011consideration and re-determination, is R.S.O. (1887) c. 53 s. 37, and it is not required that the application should be made before the last day of the term next after the making of the award as provided by 9 & 10 W. 4 c. 15 s. 2. Gwynne J. dissenting.\nAn award may be remitted to arbitrators for re-consideration and redetermination under the Ontario statute though the result of the re-consideration may be to have the award virtually set aside by a different, or even contrary, decision of the arbitrators.\nThe court is justified in remitting an award to the arbitrators if fraud or fraudulent concealment on the part of the persons in whose favor it is made is established, or if new evidence is discovered which, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, could not have been discovered before the award was made.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] varying the order of the Divisional Court by which the proceedings were remitted to arbitrators for further reference.\nThe appellants, Green & Co., are assignees of policies of insurance against fire issued by the respective respondents to C.W. & J. Henderson, a firm carrying on a general business at Wingham, Ont. The property insured haying been lost, and a dispute having arisen in respect of such loss, the matter was referred to arbitration under a clause in the policy, the arbitrators chosen being Judge Chadwick, of Guelph, and Judge Davis, of London. The submission contained in the policy provided that in case they could not agree upon an award the arbitrators chosen should appoint an umpire and such umpire should make an award upon the evidence taken before the two arbitrators without calling the witnesses before him or hearing the parties. Evidence was taken by the arbitrators and they being unable to agree Judge Woods, of Stratford, was chosen as the umpire, and an award was published adjudging that appellants were entitled to receive from the several companies the aggregate sum of $4,000 with interest. The submission to arbitration was then made a rule of court according to a provision therein contained.\nThe several companies afterwards commenced actions to set aside the award as being fraudulent. These actions were discontinued and other actions instituted for the same purpose. Then, ten months after the award was made, the respondents moved the Divisional Court to set the award aside and to remit the matter to the arbitrators for re-consideration and re-determination. The grounds of such motion were that the umpire had not decided the matter on the statements of the arbitrators as required by the submission; that the owners of the property insured did not make a full statement of the property saved but fraudulently concealed a portion thereof and claimed that it was burnt, and gave false testimony in respect to it; and that new evidence had been discovered as to such fraudulent dealing and perjury. This motion was heard by Mr. Justice Rose, who made the following order:\u2014\n\u201cIt is ordered that the matter of the said submis- sion be referred back to the said arbitrators and umpire to take evidence and inquire and report as to whether any of the goods insured, and if any to what extent, were not destroyed by fire, either by reason of salvage, fraud or concealment on the part of the assured or by reason of any other cause, and that in respect of the question so remitted the reference and proceedings thereon be governed by the terms of the original submission herein.\u201d\nThe respondents appealed from this order with a view of having the matters sent back to the arbitrators without any restriction as to the evidence to be taken, and the appellants, by way of cross-appeal, sought to have the application to set aside or remit the award dismissed. The Court of Appeal varied the order of Mr. Justice Rose by ordering the case to be sent back on the terms of the original submission. From that decision this appeal was brought.\nAylesworth and Hellmuth for the appellants.\nThe application to set aside the award was made too late and the court had no jurisdiction to entertain it. By 9 & 10 Will. 3 ch. 15 sec. 2 such an application had to be made before the last day of the term next after the making of the award. Terms were abolished in Ontario by 44 Vic. ch. 5 sec. 18[2] but the statute expressly provides that in cases where they were previously used for determining the measure of time in which any act should be done they are still to be referred to for the same purpose. This is also the case in England under the Judicature Act, 1873. College of Christ\u2019s Hospital v. Martin[3]. In Kean v. Edwards[4] Armour C.J. held that an award must be moved against within the time corresponding to the term after it was made.\nBetween July, 1887, when the award was made, and May, 1888, the time of moving to set it aside, some three terms would have elapsed under the old system.\nIt will be urged that the award is not set aside but only remitted to the arbitrators, and therefore it is not within the statute. As to that the motion is to set aside, and the effect of the order is, practically, to set it aside. The arbitrators may refuse, and cannot be compelled, to act further, and the time for bringing an action on the policy has elapsed. The case of Leicester v. Grazebrook[5] is relied upon by the respondents. That case is opposed to a long line of decisions and has not been considered of sufficient importance to appear in the regular reports. Moreover, the case has no application as matters were presented to the court which are wanting in the present case. See also Zachary v. Shepherd[6].\nRespondent\u2019s counsel was called upon to argue the question of jurisdiction.\nBain Q.C. for the respondents.\nBy R.S.O. (1887) ch. 53 sec. 37, the court may, from time to time, or at any time, remit matters referred, or any part of them, to the arbitrators for re-consideration.\nThe authorities show that it is within the discretion of the court to deal with an award of arbitrators and the question is whether or not the discretion will be exercised in each case as it comes up.\nThe following authorities were cited. Russell on Awards[7]; Burnand v. Wainwright[8]; In re Dare Valley Ry. Co.[9]; Warburton v. Haslingden Local Board[10]; Caswell v. Groucutt[11]; Gartside v. Gartslde[12].\nAylesworth and Hellmulh on the merits.\nThe evidence charged to be false is that of Henderson who had no interest in the proceedings but to set an award aside on such ground the false testimony must be that of the party seeking to enforce it. Scales v. East London Waterworks Co.[13]; Pilmore v. Hood[14].\nThe respondents having chosen their remedy by bringing an action cannot afterwards ask for a summary order.\nThe fraud should be established in a proceeding where the appellants could have means of protecting themselves; it cannot be tried out in this way. Mills v. Society of Bowyers[15].\nBain Q.C. for the respondents cited Redmond on Awards[16]; Abouloff v. Oppenheimer[17].\nSTRONG J.\u2014This matter was originally a reference to arbitration of a claim for loss under a policy of insurance against fire on a stock of dry goods granted by the respondents in favor of Messrs. C.W. & J. Henderson, which claim had been assigned by the Hendersons to the present appellants, Green & Co.\nThe technical objection insisted upon by the appellants, and which at the hearing of the appeal seemed to make it very difficult to support the decision appealed against, has not, on further consideration, appeared to me to be insurmountable.\nThe enactment of 9 & 10 Wm. 3 c. 15, which enabled a party to a submission made a rule of court to apply to set aside an award upon the ground that the same was procured by \u201ccorruption or undue means,\u201d provided the application was made before the last day of the term following the making of the award, would have become, as regards the limitation of the time for moving, literally inapplicable when, by the Judicature Act, terms were abolished, if it had not been for the 56th see. of the act, which provided that the division of the year into terms might still be referred to for the purpose of determining the time within which any act was required to be done. College of Christ v. Martin[18]; Giles v. Morrow[19]; Kean v. Edwards[20].\nBy section 37 of the act respecting arbitrations and references (Revised Statutes Ontario 1887, cap. 53) it is enacted that when the submission has been made a rule of court\nthe court or a judge may at any time and from time to time remit the matters referred, or any or either of them, to the reconsideration of the arbitrator or arbitrators or umpire, as the case may require, upon such terms as to costs and otherwise as to the court or judge seem proper.\nThis section is almost a verbal reproduction of sec. 8 of the English C.L.P. Act of 1854.\nIn exercise of the jurisdiction thus conferred an application was made to Mr. Justice Rose in May, 1888, more than three terms after the publication of the award,\nfor an order to declare that the award in this matter is void and invalid and should be set aside and to remit the matters referred to the re-considtration and re-determination of the original arbitrators mentioned in the said submission.\nThis motion was supported by voluminous affidavits to the effect that since the publication of the award new evidence had been discovered showing that valuable goods, which were claimed to have been destroyed by the fire, had not, in fact, been so destroyed, but had been concealed and not accounted for by the insured.\nI do not propose to enter into any consideration of the evidence upon the merits of the application, but I may say at once that I entirely agree with the court below that these affidavits and the cross-examination had upon them, as well as the cross\u2011examination of the appellants\u2019 witnesses, make out a prim\u00e2 facie case of fraud amply sufficient to warrant a re-consideration of the case referred, if the rules of procedure will admit of such a disposition of the matter; and further, that it sufficiently established that this evidence has been discovered since the award, and could not, by reason able diligence, have been discovered before.\nMr. Justice Rose disposed of the motion by making an order referring it back to the arbitrators and umpire:\nTo take evidence and inquire and report as to whether any of the goods insured, and if any to what extent, were not destroyed by fire either by reason of salvage, fraud or concealment on the part of the assured, or by reason of any other cause.\nThis order was varied by the Court of Appeal by directing a general reference back to the arbitrators for re-determination and re-consideration upon the terms of the original submission to be substituted for the limited reference back directed by Mr. Justice Rose. From this order of the Court of Appeal the present appeal has been taken to this court.\nThere can be no doubt that if it was not for section 37 of the Ontario Arbitration Act already extracted there would, in consequence of the lapse of time, have been no jurisdiction to interfere with the award by simply setting it aside.\nThe validity of the order under appeal must, therefore, depend altogether upon the extent of jurisdiction conferred upon the court below by the 37th section.\nIt was argued with great force and ability by Mr. Aylesworth for the appellants that inasmuch as the order under appeal would, in the event of the arbitrators upon a re-consideration of the matters referred coming to a different determination from that contained in the original award, have the effect of setting it aside altogether the application to refer back involved a proceeding which the statute of William the 3rd expressly required to be made not later than the term following the publication of the award. I cannot accede to this argument. In every case in which the matter of the submission under the statute is sent back to the arbitrator for re-consideration the consequence may follow that the award will eventually be superseded and thus, virtually, set aside by a different, possibly a directly contrary, decision of the arbitrator. If, therefore, the objection put forward were to prevail the result would be to strike the words \u201cat any time\u201d contained in section 37 out of the statute altogether. This would be a virtual repeal of the enactment, and no authority has suggested that it can be done. Upon the only admissible construction sec. 37 must, following the plain words in which it is expressed, be taken as authorising an order remitting the reference to the arbitrator, although the application is not made within the limit of time prescribed by the statute of William.\nIt is obvious that there is a wide difference between the jurisdiction conferred by the statute of William and that arising under the 37th section of the Arbitration and Awards Act. Under the former the award could only be absolutely set aside, with the effect of annulling the submission altogether and remitting the parties to their strictly legal rights and remedies before the ordinary tribunals, but under the reference back authorized by the latter act the arbitrator chosen by the parties (in the case of a voluntary submission) would be still left to deal with the case, the submission would be kept alive and the ultimate decision would thus remain with the conventional tribunal selected by the parties. These considerations may well have induced the legislature to impose less strictness as regards time in cases coming under the modern enact- ment than that which was applied by the express limitation contained in the former act. The conclusion is, therefore, that both upon authority and principle, when a proper case is made for a reference back under the 37th section the application is not restricted as to time by the limitation prescribed by the statute of Wm. 3 for moving to set aside an award. This was decided by the case of Leicester v. Grazebrook[21] referred to in the judgment of the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal, and I see no reason to doubt the correctness of the report of that case. All that is required is that the application must be made with reasonable promptitude, and it is, in my opinion, shown that that condition was complied with in the case before us.\nThe question is then reduced to this: What is to be considered a proper case for exercising the jurisdiction given to the courts by the 37th section?\nUpon this head the authorities undoubtedly show that, for some reason, the English courts have by their decisions very much restricted the operation of the 8th section of the C.L.P. Act of 1854, corresponding to the 37th section of the Ontario Act. The reason of this seems to have been a repugnance to entertaining applications which might, in any way, involve a review of the arbitrators\u2019 decision in the nature of an appeal.\nIn the case of Hodgkinson v. Fernie[22], decided in 1857 by a court composed of judges of the highest authority, it was said that the jurisdiction to refer back under the statute was intended to be limited to cases in which that power would, before the statute, have been exercised under a clause to that effect contained in the submission, and was, therefore, to be restricted to cases of fraud and to cases of mistake of fact or law either apparent on the face of the award or on some paper referentially incorporated with it or volun- tarily acknowledged by the arbitrator; and this statement of the law was expressly approved by the same court in the late case of Dinn v. Blake[23]. As these decisions do not seem to have been called in question in any later reported case I am of opinion that we must accept them as establishing the construction of the statute in this respect, and, therefore, as authorities which we must follow in deciding this appeal.\nThen, to apply the law thus propounded, I am of opinion that the present case does come within the rule which is laid down in the cases cited as to what constitutes a proper case for a reference back to the arbitrator for reconsideration.\nIn Hodgkinson v. Fernie[24], Williams J. says:\u2014\nThe law has for many years been settled, and remains so at this day, that when a cause or matters in difference are referred to an arbitrator, whether a lawyer or layman, he is constituted the sole and final judge of all questions both of law and of fact. Many cases have fully established that position where awards have been attempted to be set aside on the ground of the admission of an incompetent witness, or the rejection of a competent one. The court has invariably met these applications by saying: \u2018you have constituted your own tribunal, you are bound by its decision.\u2019 The only exceptions to that rule are cases where the award is the result of corruption or fraud, and one other which, though it is to be regretted, is now I think firmly established, viz., where the question of law necessarily arises on the face of the award or upon some paper accompanying and forming part of the award.\nAnd at the conclusion of his judgment the same judge says:\nThis provision of the statute was intended merely to introduce into every order of reference the clause familiarly known as Mr. Richard\u2019s clause. Nobody ever dreamt that the introduction of that clause into the order had the effect of altering the law as to the decision of the arbitrator being conclusive.\nIn the same case Willes J. says[25]: It seems to me that the 8th section was simply intended to enable a court to send back a case to the arbitrator in all cases where otherwise, by reason of the want of a clause for that purpose, they would have been precluded from so doing.\nThe judgment of Williams J. has been generally received as a correct statement of the law and was expressly approved in the case of Dinn v. Blake[26]. Although it is not so said directly, yet I understand Mr. Justice Williams to imply, that in a case of fraud, meaning thereby, of course, fraud or fraudulent concealment by one of the parties, or by some one identified with a party, a reference back under the 8th section would be proper; and it is apparent from the following passage in the judgment of Brett J. in Dinn v. Blake26, that the last named judge also understood it in that sense.\nIn Dinn v. Blake26, Mr. Justice Brett, says:\u2014\nThis is a reference under the C.L.P. Act. Before that act there was some fluctuation of opinion as to the question in what cases an award might be referred back; and after the act it was asserted that the powers of the court were larger than they were before. In the case of Hodgkinson v. Fernie[27], both questions, viz., as to when there was power to refer back and as to the effect of the statute, were considered, and the law was clearly declared in the judgment of Williams J. He lays it down that the award cannot be sent back and the arbitrator forced to review it merely on the ground that there has been a mistake of fact or of law. The exceptions he mentions to the rule are where there has been corruption or fraud, and where it appears on the face of the award that there has been a mistake of law or fact.\nThen, taking these authorities as furnishing the criterion by which we are to ascertain in the present case if there was jurisdiction to send back the award for re-consideration by the arbitrators, I am of opinion that the evidence is amply sufficient to make out a prim\u00e2 facie case of fraud and fraudulent concealment on the part of the Hendersons under whom the present appellants claim. It is shown that goods of consider- able value were concealed in such an unusual way as to indicate a deliberate intention to defraud, some of these goods having been actually packed away in the coffins in an undertaker\u2019s shop. But, as I said before, I do not intend to discuss the evidence, and I content myself with the observations on it already made, and with saying that I entirely agree in the view of it taken by the Court of Appeal. I think there would be a great failure of justice and a great defect in the law, if a case like the present could not be ordered back for review by the arbitrators.\nThere is, in addition to the ground of fraudulent concealment of the goods, another distinct ground upon which the order appealed against can be supported. In the extracts already made from the judgments delivered in Hodgkinson v. Fernie27 it is, as already mentioned, said that the measure of jurisdiction under the 8th section was the extent of the power to refer back under the clause which it was the practice to introduce into submissions and orders of reference before the statute was passed. In the case of Burnand v. Wainwright[28] Wightman J., under a clause of the kind just mentioned, referred the case back to the arbitrator on the ground of the discovery of new evidence material to the inquiry, although there were no circumstances of fraud or concealment shown. In the case of Davenport v. Vickery[29] a similar order was made under like circumstances. These cases have never, so far as I can discover, been overruled or dissented from, though it is true that Willes J., in his judgment in Hodgkinson v. Fernie27 mentions the case of Burnand v. Wainwright28 and says he expresses neither \u201cassent nor dissent\u201d from the doctrine there laid down. I think we may, therefore, assume these cases to be still law. Then, if the standard by which we are to measure the jurisdiction in the present case depends on what could have been done under the conventional clause irrespective of the statute, these cases show that apart from the question of fraud, and on the distinct ground of the discovery of new material evidence, no want of diligence or promptitude in discovering it being imputable to the respondents, the case ought to be referred back, and a fortiori ought it to be so dealt with when these newly discovered facts go to show that a fraud was practised by the parties under whom the appellants claim.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J. concurred.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by my brother Strong.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014(After stating the facts of the case His Lordship proceeded as follows):\u2014\nIt was enacted by 9 & 10 Wm. 3 c. 15 sec. 2 that\nany arbitration or umpirage procured by corruption or undue means shall be adjudged and esteemed void and of none effect, and accordingly be set aside by any court of law or equity, so as complaint of such corruption or undue practice be made in the court where the rule is made for submission to such arbitration or umpirage before the last day of the next term after such arbitration or umpirage made and published to the parties.\nBy the Ontario Judicature Act of 1881, 44 Vic. ch. 5 sec. 18, it was enacted that:\nThe division of the legal year into terms shall be abolished so far as relates to the administration of justice, and there shall not be terms applicable to any sitting or business of the high court of justice, or of any commissioners to whom any jurisdiction may be assigned under this Act, or of any commissioners of assize, but in all cases in which, under the law now existing, the terms into which the legal year is divided are used as a measure for determining the time at or within which any act is required to be done the same may continue to be referred to for the same or the like purpose, unless and until provision is otherwise made by any lawful authority.\nThis enactment is taken verbatim from the Imperial Statute, 36 & 37 Vic. c. 66 sec. 26. Now, if the statute of William III is to apply to the motion made in the present case by the insurance companies, the last day for making complaint of the corruption or undue practice charged was Friday, the ninth day of September, 1887.\nBut it is contended that it is not the statute of William III that governs the present case, but the 164th section of the Upper Canada Common Law Procedure Act, ch. 22, C.S.U.C, which was taken from section 8 of the Imperial Common Law Procedure Act, 17 & 18 Vic. ch. 125, and which is now the 37th sec. of ch. 53 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1887, and is as follows:\u2014\nIn case, in a reference to arbitration, whether under this Act or otherwise, the submission is made a rule of the high court or a county court, the court or a judge may, at any time, and from time to time, remit the matters referred, or any or either of them, to the re\u2011consideration of the arbitrator, or arbitrators, or umpire, as the case may require, upon such terms as to costs, or otherwise, as to the court or judge seem proper.\nWe must be governed in a case like the present by the decisions of the English courts upon the Imperial statute in pari materi\u00e2.\nIt is to be borne in mind that the sole grounds of the motion as stated in the notice of motion are: 1st, misconduct in the umpire in deciding without hearing the statements of the arbitrators as required by the submission; and\n2nd, which is the main ground and the one upon which the Court of Appeal for Ontario has proceeded, on fraudulent concealment by C.W. and J. Henderson, the insured through whom Green & Co. claim, of a portion of the property saved from the fire, and fraud and perjury committed by them in the evidence given by them on the hearing before the arbitrators. Now in the English courts it has never been adjuged or contended that the above section of the common law procedure act had either the effect of extending the time for moving to set aside an award as having been procured by fraudulent and corrupt means within the statute of William, or of authorising the reference back of an award procured, as the award in the present case is alleged to have been, by corrupt means including fraud and perjury, and which if so procured the statute of William declared should be adjudged to be void and of none effect and should be set aside by the court in which the submission was made a rule, so as complaint should be made within the time prescribed by the statute. No case has been found in the English courts, where the reference back of an award alleged to have been procured by corruption and undue means was ever granted or asked for as being within the provisions of the above cited section of the common law procedure act; but on the contrary the intent of the legislature in enacting that section, as declared in the cases which have been adjudged upon it, is clearly, I think, established to be that a reference back in a case like the present is not a thing which is authorised by the section. In Hodgkinson v. Fernie[30] Cockburn C.J. was of opinion that the section of the C.L.P. act in question was only intended to apply to cases where the court sees grounds for setting aside the award, but where the mistake might be set right by sending the matter back to the arbitrator:\nIt is true, he says, the section gives the court authority in any case where reference shall be made to arbitration at any time, and from time to time, to remit the matters referred, or any or either of them, to the re-consideration and re-determination of the said arbitrator upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as to the said court or judge may seem proper.\nI am, however, clearly of opinion that it was not intended by that enactment to alter the general law as to the principles upon which the courts had been in the habit of acting in determining whether they would or would not set aside awards, but merely to give the court power to remit the matter to the arbitrator for re-consideration in all cases, though the submission should not contain that extremely useful clause giving them that power where it turned out that there was a fatal defect in the award, but of such a nature as not to render it expedient to set aside the award, and thus render nugatory all the expense that had been incurred under the reference. I see nothing \u201con the face of the award\u201d that would have justified the court in interfering to set it aside, and therefore, I think it is not a case in which jurisdiction to send it back is conferred upon us by sec. 8 of 17 & 18 Vic. ch. 125.\nAnd in that case Williams J. says:\nThis provision of the statute was intended merely to introduce into every order of reference the clause familiarly known as \u201cMr. Richards\u2019 clause.\u201d\nCrowder J. says:\u2014\nThe intention of the 8th section evidently was to give the court the same power in all cases to send back an award for re-consideration, as they before had only in those cases where the submission or order contained a special provision to that effect.\nAnd Willes J. declares his opinion to be precisely to the same effect. So in Holland v. Judd[31], in 1858, the same court as had decided Hodgkinson v. Fernie[32] sent back an award which was, upon the face of it, defective in the arbitrator,\u2014a county court judge,\u2014not having certified how he disposed of the several issues in the cause. In Hogge v. Burgess[33] the Court of Exchequer refused to remit the matter of an award to have a correction made in a matter in which it was contended the arbitrator was mistaken both in law and in fact because no defect appeared on the face of the award, and Martin B. giving judgment referring to Phillips v. Evans[34], says: Alderson B. says it is safer to abide by the general rule of not allowing awards to be set aside for mistakes. That was clearly the old rule, and we have now to deal with an act of parliament operating upon these proceedings by compulsory reference. It is well known that up to a certain period there was no power to send back an award to an arbitrator; the clause for that purpose was first introduced by the late Mr. Vaughan Richards, and it enabled the court to remit the matters referred to the arbitrator instead of setting aside the award.\nThe legislature, he then says, acting on that state of things enacted the 3rd, 7th and 8th sections of the common law procedure act, and after setting out these sections he says as to the 8th:\nIt seems to me that is nothing more than enacting that the clause introduced by Mr. Richards shall apply to all orders of reference made under the 3rd section.\nAnd Channel B. there says:\nThe 8th section gives the court or a judge no more power than they would have had under an ordinary reference, that is, they may remit in compulsory references, where in references made by consent they might have sent back the matters to the arbitrator.\nIn Lord v. Hawkins[35] the award was bad upon its face, and the order was made in 1857 to remit the matters in difference under a special agreement in the submission to that effect. In Mills v. Bowyers\u2019 Society[36] the object of the 8th sec. of 17 & 18 Vic. ch. 125, was declared to be:\nTo enable the court, where any error formal or otherwise had occurred which would vitiate an award, to send it back if they thought fit to the arbitrators \u201cto correct such error,\u201d instead of setting the award wholly aside.\nAnd it was further held that:\nIf a mistake had been made in the award not apparent on the face of it, and such mistake is admitted in an affidavit by the arbitrators, such an admission is sufficient to authorize the court to refer it back under the statute, as it was to set aside the award under the former practice.\nAnd so also that: Although the arbitrators insist that they have made no mistake, but state the principle upon which they made the award, and the court is of opinion that such principle is not consistent with the reference, the court may remit the matter.\nIn Morris v. Morris[37], in 1856, the award was remitted to the arbitrator to enable him to correct a defect appearing on the face of the award. In Aitken\u2019s Arbitration[38], in 1857, the award was remitted to enable the arbitrator in like manner to correct a defect appearing on the face of the award.\nIn Flynn v. Robertson[39] in 1869, the arbitrator had, by mistake, made an award in favor of the defendant instead of the plaintiff; the mistake was admitted by both parties and by the arbitrator who explained the circumstances under which it had occurred, and the award was remitted to him to enable him to correct the mistake. In re Dare Valley Railway Company[40] in 1868, the court remitted an award back to an arbitrator, it having appeared from a paper produced by the arbitrator, in explanation of his award, that there had been a mistake made by him as to the subject matter referred to him, and in point of legal principle affecting the basis on which the award was made. But in Dinn v. Blake[41], in 1875, the Court of Common Pleas held that the court will not, in case of a mistake, send back an award without an assurance from the arbitrator himself that he is conscious of the mistake and desires the assistance of the court to rectify it. It is there expressly laid down that an award, good upon its face, is final, and cannot be interfered with by the court except only in cases where there is corruption on the part of the arbitrator or excess of jurisdiction, or where the arbitrator himself admits that there is a mistake and, as it were, craves the assistance of the court in setting it right.\nBy the above cases it appears, I think, to be well established that the jurisdiction conferred by the C.L.P. Act upon the courts to refer back awards and the matters in difference to the re\u2011consideration and re-determination of arbitrators was a remedial jurisdiction conferred by way of substitution for the jurisdiction formerly exercised by the courts to set aside awards for defects appearing on the face of the award, excess of jurisdiction or acknowledged mistakes in the award, and the jurisdiction so conferred is limited to the like cases as before the passing of the C.L.P. Act it had been exercised in by agreement contained in the submission to arbitration, namely:\n1. Where some defect appears on the face of the award which, in order to make the award unobjectionable, should be rectified;\n2. Where, although no defect appears on the face of the award, a mistake has been made by the arbitrator, which he admits having made in such a manner as to display, as it were, a desire to be enabled by the court to rectify;\n3. Where the arbitrator has exceeded his jurisdiction; or\u2014\n4. Where the arbitrator states the principle upon which he has proceeded and the court is of opinion that such principle is not consistent with the reference.\nNow, whether or not the above heads cover all the cases in which the courts can exercise jurisdiction to refer back an award, there can be no doubt that the motion to refer back authorized by the Common Law Procedure Act is in substitution for the motion to set aside the award for certain particular grounds of objection under the old practice, and there has been no case found of a reference back, or of an application for that purpose where, the objection to the award was that it had been procured by the corruption, fraud and perjury of one of the parties to the arbitration, or of a witness. Indeed, such a motion could not, in my judgment, be entertained for a moment, because, as the jurisdiction to refer back is a remedial jurisdiction, substitutional for the jurisdiction formerly exercised to set aside the award for certain grounds of complaint not going to the merits of the matters in difference, it would be destructive of the principle upon which the jurisdiction to refer back is founded if it should be absolutely necessary to adjudge the award to be fraudulent and void as a preliminary step to referring it back, as it would be, and as has been done in the present case, where the objection to the award is founded upon the allegation that it had been procured by the fraud, corruption and perjury of one of the parties thereto, or of a witness, and so irremediable. The notice of motion is not for an order to refer back the award for its amendment in some particular in which it appeared upon its face to be defective, or for anything done by the arbitrators in excess of jurisdiction, or for any mistake which needed correction, but for an order whereby it should be \u201cdeclared,\u201d that is adjudicated, that the award is void and invalid as having been procured by the fraud, corruption and perjury of the assured, and for that reason should be set aside, and to remit the matters referred to the re-consideration and re-determination, &c., so that unless the award should be declared to be void for the reasons stated in the notice of motion and should therefore be set aside there was nothing asked to be, nor in point of fact was there anything to be, referred back. And if the award should be set aside, as that could be ordered only as a consequence of the court pronouncing the award to be void as having been procured by the fraud, corruption and perjury of the assured, who were, and in the nature of things could be, the only witnesses upon the points in respect of which the fraud and perjury was charged to have been committed, it would be a mere delusion to refer back the matters in difference for re\u2011consideration by the arbitrators accompanied by a judgment that the testimony upon which the award was founded was false and perjured, and therefore not to be received or entertained. The object of the insurance companies in making the motion would, therefore, seem to have been, as its effect undoubtedly was, to operate, not as a motion to refer back within the meaning and under the provision of the C.L.P. Act in that behalf, but simply as a motion to have the award adjudged to be void and invalid as having been procured by the fraud, corruption and perjury of the Hendersons, the parties insured. The learned Chief Justice of Ontario, in his judgment in the Court of Appeal, says that the evidence before the learned judge before whom the motion was made either amounted to nothing or \u201cwas a case of actual, personal, wilful fraud,\u201d and he might have added \u201cperjury on the part of the assured.\u201d\nIf, then, the award was open to objection upon this ground it was quite unnecessary to move to set it aside, for if void for the reasons stated it never could be enforced, and if, notwithstanding that the award was void, a motion to set it aside should be made the court had no jurisdiction to entertain it as not having been made within the time prescribed by 9 & 10 Wm. 3 c. 15. Upon this point there does not seem to be any contradiction in the cases. In North British Railway Company v. Trowsdale[42], it was held, in 1866, that a motion to set aside an award could not be made even with consent of the parties after one term after the publication of the award\nIn re Corporation of Huddersfield and Jacomb[43], it was held, in 1874, by Malins V.C., and affirmed by the Court of Appeal[44], that a motion to set aside an award must be made within the time prescribed by the statute 9 & 10 Wm. 13, c. 15, but that the service of notice of motion was a sufficient commencement of complaint to satisfy the provisions of the statute.\nIn College of Christ v. Martin[45] it was held, in 1877, by the Court of Appeal, consisting of Cockburn C.J., and Bramwell and Brett, Lords Justices, affirming the judgment of the Q.B. Division, that notwithstanding that terms were done away with by 36 & 37 Vic. c. 66 s. 26. they are used still as a means of determining the time within which proceedings to set aside an award must be taken, and that in the particular case, as the 8th of May was the last day upon which, under 9 & 10 Wm. 3 c. 15, the proceeding must have been instituted, the court had no jurisdiction to entertain a motion made after that day. And in Smith v. Parkside Mining Company[46], it was held in 1880 by the Exchequer Division following in re Corporation of Huddersfield and Jacomb43, that the service of a notice of motion was a complaint made in the court before the last day of the term after the publication of the award and that therefore the statute of William 3 had been complied with and the court had jurisdiction to entertain the motion to set aside the award. This is an instructive case because the objection to the award was of a technical character, viz., want of finality appearing on the face of the award, and the case was, therefore, one in which an application to refer back the award for amendment under the provision of the C.L.P. Act in that behalf might have been made; and the court, after determining that the proceedings to set aside the award had been taken within the time prescribed by the statute of William, and after having heard the motion, refused to set aside the award but themselves made an order referring it back for amendment, thus showing that where a motion is made to set aside an award the statute of William must be complied with, and that where an order is made under the provisions of the C.L.P. Act to refer back the award is not set aside and the reference back is substitutional and wholly remedial.\nIn the present case the judgment appealed from appears to have proceeded wholly upon the assumption that all of the above cases, showing a concurrence of all the courts as to the law where the application is to set aside an award, are overruled by the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division in Leicester v. Grazebrook[47], decided in 1879. It is obvious from Smith v. The Parkside Mining Co.[48] that the Exchequer Division were not of that opinion in 1880, when the judgment in Leicester v. Grazebrook47 was recent; but apart from the difficulty of conceiving that Cockburn C.J., Lush and Manisty JJ. sitting in the Queen\u2019s Bench Division could have contemplated that they were making a decision in the slightest degree at variance with the judgment of Cockburn C.J. himself, sitting with Lords Justices Bramwell and Brett in the Court of Appeal in Christ College v. Martin,[49] or with the judgment of Malins V.C. in L.R. 17 Eq. affirmed in ap- peal by Lords Justices James and Mellish, in 10 Ch. App. 92, a reference to the meagre report of Leicester v. Grazebrook[50] shows that the motion was not at all to set aside an award but the ordinary case of a motion, under the C.L.P. Act, to refer back the award for the correction of some technical defect in the award, the nature of which is not even stated in the very meagre report of the case; but that it was the ordinary case of a reference back for the correction of some technical defect is apparent from the fact that there does not appear to have been any objection to the reference back as soon as it was decided that the application was not too late. The case was evidently one of an application by the party in whose favor the award was made for the purpose of having rectified some technical defect appearing on the face of the award and not an application by the party against whom the award was made, as in the present case, to have the award declared void as having been procured, as alleged, by fraud, corruption and perjury, and it can have no application in the present case.\nBut, even if the application had not been too late, and if, therefore, the court had had jurisdiction to entertain a motion to set aside the award, I am of opinion that the grounds upon which the application was rested, and has been maintained, were of such a nature as to have required a trial of the complaint with the intervention of a jury in an ordinary action raising the precise issue whether or not the award had been procured by the fraud, corruption and perjury charged. If the award, which, it must be borne in mind, was in favor of Green & Co., is to be avoided by the evidence of John Henderson, taken eight months after the making of the award, in which he now asserts that both he himself and C.W. Henderson were guilty of wilful and corrupt perjury in the evidence given by them upon the arbitration, the parties to be affected by such evidence, and who are not even suggested to have been privy to the perjury whereof Mr. John Henderson now accuses himself and C.W. Henderson, should surely have the opportunity given them of questioning the truth and bona fides of Mr. John Henderson\u2019s later evidence, and of taking the opinion of a jury upon the question whether the perjury was committed in the evidence given on the arbitration or in that given eight months after by Mr. John Henderson and used by the insurance companies on their application to have the award declared to be void. The language of Lords Justices James and Thesiger in Flower v. Lloyd[51], although disapproved of by the Court of Appeal in Abouloff v. Oppenheimer[52], as applied to the case of an action instituted to avoid a judgment upon the allegation of its having been obtained by fraud and perjury of the party in whose favor it was rendered, seems to me, when applied to the present case, to be singularly appropriate, and so applied, it would read much as follows:\nAssuming the alleged fraud and perjury to have been committed by C.W. and J. Henderson, as is now alleged by the latter, can such fraud and perjury be established in such a manner as to be acted upon judicially to the prejudice of Green & Co., in whose favor the award was made, upon a motion made to the court to declare the award to be void for such fraud and perjury? Has the court on motion jurisdiction to declare, or which is the same thing to adjudicate, that an award had been procured by fraud and perjury, and was, therefore, void to the prejudice of the person in whose favor the award was made and who was a stranger to the fraud and perjury charged? These questions would require very grave consideration before they are answered in the affirmative. Where is litigation to end if judgment obtained in an action or an award obtained on an arbitration fought out adversely upon the very question of fraud, the charge of which is now repeated, could be declared to be void upon the ground of fraud and perjury, on the inquiry in relation to it, on a mere motion before a judge? Perjuries, falsehoods, frauds, when detected, must be punished and punished severely, but can such grave charges, after having been once tried, be re-opened even upon the confession of one of several parties accusing himself and others of fraud and perjury, and be substantiated (to the prejudice of a party who is a stranger to the fraud and perjury), otherwise than in an action instituted in the ordinary manner, wherein an issue as to the existence of the fraud and perjury charged shall be joined between the parties sought to be prejudiced by their being substantiated, who, in the present case, are Green & Co., and the parties seeking to be benefited thereby, who are the insurance companies?\nIn my opinion these questions can only be effectually answered either in an action brought by the insurance companies, or one of them, of the nature of the actions commenced by writs of summons in November, 1887, and discontinued, or in an action by Green & Co. upon the award, if the court below should think fit, upon their motion to enforce the award, to decline doing so, and should leave them to their action upon the award. But for the reasons already given I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs, and that the motion made in the court below by the insurance companies should be ordered to be refused with costs. PATTERSON J.\u2014The facts on which the questions in dispute mainly turn may be briefly stated.\nA firm of C.W. & J. Henderson insured their stock of merchandise with several insurance companies. A fire occurred. After the fire, and before the loss was adjusted, the Hendersons assigned their claims upon the policies to John Green & Co. Disputes arising respecting the loss, a submission to arbitration was entered into between the several insurance companies, C.W. & J. Henderson and John Green & Co. The arbitrators were Judge Chad wick of Guelph and Judge Davis of London, who, if they disagreed, but not unless they disagreed, were to appoint an umpire who was to decide the matters in difference upon the statements of the arbitrators and such reference to the evidence as he should think proper, and make his award without hearing the parties or examination of witnesses before him.\nThe arbitrators disagreed and appointed Judge Woods of Chatham as umpire.\nThe umpire made his award on the 28th of July, 1881.\nThe submission was made a rule of the High Court of Justice, Queen\u2019s Bench Division, at the instance of John Green & Co., and in June, 1888, over ten months after the making of the award, the insurance companies moved for an order to declare that the award was void and invalid, and that it should be set aside, and to remit the matters referred to the re\u2011consideration and re-determination of the original arbitrators mentioned in the submission.\nThe principal ground of the motion was the alleged recent discovery that the Hendersons had by deliberate fraud concealed a part of their goods which they had saved from the fire, and that their proofs of loss and also their evidence before the arbitrators were fraudulently false in relation to the amount of their loss.\nThe motion was heard before Mr. Justice Rose, who made an order:\nThat the matter of the said submission be referred back to the said arbitrators and umpire to take evidence and inquire and report as to whether any of the goods insured, and if any to what extent, were not destroyed by fire, either by reason of salvage, fraud or concealment on the part of the assured or by reason of any other cause, and that in respect of the question so remitted the reference and proceedings thereon be governed by the terms of the original submission herein.\nFrom that order the companies appealed to the Court of Appeal, contending that the award ought to be set aside and the whole matter remitted back to the arbitrators.\nThe appeal was allowed and an order made that\nthe matter of the submission between the parties above-named be referred back to the arbitrators for re-consideration and re-determination upon the terms of the said original submission; and that all questions of costs, in respect of such reference back, shall be reserved till after the determination of the said matters so referred back.\nBefore the Court of Appeal the respondents (who are appellants in this court) were not content to support the order of Mr. Justice Rose. They insisted, by way of cross-appeal, and they now insist, that the motion ought to have been altogether dismissed because of the lapse of time since the making of the award, and because the case presented was one for simply setting aside the award and not for referring the matter back to the arbitrators. Their answer to a motion to simply set aside the award would have been the conclusive one that, under the statute 9 & 10 Wm. III, ch. 15 the motion could not be later than the term following the making of the award.\nA good many of the numerous cases which touch, more or less directly, the subjects of the contest have been brought to our attention in the course of the learned and thorough discussion at our bar. I shall not find it necessary to refer to many of them. I do not think the solution of the questions in dispute requires much more than a careful attention to the statutes on the subject of arbitrations, and I think that the questions are correctly solved by the judgment now in review.\nIt is familiar law that when parties submitted a dispute to arbitration, choosing their own tribunal, a court of common law could not set aside the award until the act of 9 & 10 Wm. III ch. 15 gave power to do so when an award was procured by corruption or undue means, provided it was complained of before the last day of the term following the making of the award.\nIt is also familiar law that in all cases but exceptional ones the courts met applications to set aside an award by saying \u201cYou have constituted your own tribunal; you are bound by its decision.\u201d The only exceptions to that rule, as stated by Williams J. in Hodgkinson v. Fernie[53], were cases where the award was the result of corruption or fraud, and one other, viz., where the question of law necessarily arose on the face of the award or upon some paper accompanying and forming part of the award.\nI shall have to refer again by-and-bye to this statement of the law.\nHodgkinson v. Fernie53 is relied on principally as a leading decision that an award will not be referred back to the arbitrator for any cause for which it could not properly be set aside. It is not my purpose to inquire whether that rule is universal and not subject to exceptions. Cases such as Flynn v. Robertson[54] and others, some of which are there cited, suggest a contrary opinion, but the inquiry is not, in my judgment, at present called for, as I shall presently show.\nThe 8th section of the English C.L.P. Act, 1854, which first gave power to refer back an award, was represented in Ontario by R.S.O. (1877), ch. 50 sec. 213 or R.S.O., (1887), ch. 53 sec. 37, which gave power to the court of which the submission was made a rule, or a judge, to\nat any time and from time to time, remit the matters referred, or any or either of them, to the re-consideration and re-determination, [these last two words are omitted in R.S.O., 1887] of the arbitrator or arbitrators or umpire as the case may require, upon such terms, &c.\nThere is here no indication of any limit to the discretion of the court on deciding for what reason an award shall be sent back. On the contrary the expressed purpose of sending it back, viz., for re-consideration and re-determination by the arbitrator, is opposed to the idea that the determination evidenced by the document, however erroneous it may be demonstrated to be, must be sacredly respected, as it also is to the idea that the only purpose in sending back an award must be for the performance of the quasi ministerial duty of correcting some apparent error by correctly expressing the determination previously arrived at. It is for reconsideration and re-determination.\nIn the present case the charge is that the award was procured by fraud. Whether or not that charge is substantiated by the evidence adduced on the motion is a matter that we can scarcely be expected to discuss very critically. It was for the court below to deal with on the evidence, and it cannot be held that the evidence did not fully justify the view taken by the court. There was no reason why the re-consideration should not be by the originally appointed arbitrators. No suggestion of unfairness or other personal objection to them was made.\nNow, taking Hodgkinson v. Hernie[55] to be a leading case on the subject, how does it apply to the immediate question? We have good authority for applying to the referring back of an award the law there laid down with more direct reference to setting aside an award. I find the remarks of Williams J., to which I have adverted, quoted by Brett J. in Dinn v. Blake[56] as if immediately addressed to the question of referring back an award. This is his language:\nIn the case of Hodghinson v Fernie[57] both questions, viz., as to when there was power to refer back, and as to the effect of the statute, were considered, and the law was clearly declared in the judgment of Williams J. He lays it down that the award cannot be sent back and the arbitrator forced to review it merely on the ground that there has been a mistake of fact or of law. The exceptions he mentions to the rule are where there has been corruption or fraud, and where it appears on the face of the award that there has been a mistake of law.\nA third exception is spoken of by Brett J. and the learned judges who sat with him, as established by the later cases of Mills v. Bowyers\u2019 Company[58] and Flynn v. Robertson[59], viz., when the arbitrator admits his mistake. In Dinn v. Blake[60] the application to refer back an award on the ground of the arbitrator being mistaken in his law was refused because the mistake was not admitted by the arbitrator and did not appear on the face of the award.\nThe case is a distinct authority for the proposition that, under the rule stated in Hodgkinson v. Fernie[61] as interpreted and applied in Dinn v. Blake60, an award may be referred back to the arbitrator for the same causes, including fraud in procuring the award, for which it may be set aside.\nWe have then to consider if the motion in this case was in time.\nIt appears to have followed the discovery of the fraud with reasonable promptness. The statute leaves the question of time at large. The expression is \u201cat any time and from time to time,\u201d giving to the courts a discretion unfettered by any statutory limit but necessarily governed, as in every case of judicial discretion, by what is under the circumstances reasonable.\nThat is the understanding evidenced by the case of Leicester v. Grazebrook[62], in which a divisional court consisting of Cockburn C.J. and of Lush and Manisty JJ. made an order to refer back an award after the time limited by the statute of William had elapsed, affirming the discretion of the court to do so when the delay was reasonably accounted for.\nWe have no report of the decision except a short note in the Law Times. It does not seem to have found its way into the Weekly Notes. It was probably one of the many cases which are merely the application to particular facts of rules that are already familiar in practice. It is useful, however, as a reported instance in which the phrase \u201cat any time and from time to time,\u201d was construed by its own force, and without qualifying it by any limitation borrowed from the statute of William.\nIt has long been my opinion that for some cause possibly the inertia arising from the intimate association in the legal mind of the statute of William III and its limitations with the subject of arbitration, the provisions of the Common Law Procedure Acts have not always been administered with as much liberality as the statutes would have justified. One notable example of this is the application to compulsory references of some of the stricter doctrines appropriate to voluntary references where the parties really appoint their own tribunal. These stricter rules of practice, adopted or continued under the C.L.P. Acts in England, were, as a matter of course, followed in Upper Canada under the C.L.P. Act of 1856, and the old measure of sanctity continued to be ascribed to awards, whether made on compulsory or voluntary references, until the important relaxation provided by the provincial legislature by giving an appeal from awards in some form, and in most cases of arbitration. The order now in appeal is in the spirit of the day, which tends to bring the subject of arbitration more under the supervision and control of the courts than formerly, and to place it more fully on a footing with other forms of litigation.\nI take the English Arbitration Act, 1889, to be also an advance in the same direction, and to remove whatever necessity may have seemed to exist for construing one enactment by reference to another. The act embodies the provisions of the C.L.P. Act and those of the act of Wm. III now in discussion. It provides in the 10th section, in the most general terms, that in all cases of reference to arbitration the court or a judge may from time to time remit the matters referred or any of them to the re-consideration of the arbitrators or umpire. Note in passing the omission of the redundant words \u201cand re-determination,\u201d which, as already pointed out, were dropped in Ontario two years earlier[63]. One provision of section 11 is that where an arbitrator or umpire has misconducted himself, or an arbitration or award has been improperly procured, the court may set aside the award. No time for this proceeding is limited by the statute, the limitation being left to the more flexible machinery of the general orders of the court[64].\nIn my opinion the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be affirmed and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for Appellants: Hellmuth & Ivey.\nSolicitors for Respondents: Bain.

(1887) c. 184 s. 477\u2014Functions of county court judge.\nThe council of the City of Toronto, under the provisions of R.S.O. (1887) c. 184 s. 477, passed a resolution directing a county court judge to inquire into dealings between the city and persons who were or had been contractors for civic works and ascertain if the city had been defrauded out of public monies in connection with such contracts; to inquire into the whole system of tendering, awarding, carrying out, fulfilling and inspecting contracts with the city; and to ascertain in what respect, if any, the system of the business of the city in that respect was defective. G. who had been a contractor with the city and whose name was mentioned in the resolution, attended before the judge and claimed that the inquiry as to his contracts should proceed only on specific charges of malfeasance or misconduct, and the judge refusing to order such charges to be formulated he applied for a writ of prohibition.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, Gwynne J. dissenting, that the county court judge was not acting judicially in holding this inquiry; that he was in no sense a court and had no power to pronounce judgment imposing any legal duty or obligation on any person; and he was not, therefore, subject to control by writ of prohibition from a superior court.\nHeld, per Gwynne J. that the writ of prohibition would lie and in the circumstances shown it ought to issue.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Robertson[2], who ordered a writ of prohibition to is- sue to restrain the judge of the county court of the county of York from proceeding with an inquiry against the plaintiff.\nThe Municipal Corporations Act[3], provides by sec. 477, as follows:\n\u201cIn case the council of any municipality at any time passes a resolution requesting the judge of the county court of the county in which the municipality is situate, to investigate any matter to be mentioned in the resolution and relating to a supposed malfeasance, breach of trust, or other misconduct on the part of any member of the council or officer of the corporation, or of any person having a contract therewith in relation to the duties or obligations of the member, officer, or other person to the municipality, or in case the council of any municipality sees fit to cause inquiry to made into or concerning any matter connected with the good government of the municipality or the conduct of any part of the public business thereof; and if the council at any time passes a resolution requesting the judge to make the inquiry, the judge shall inquire into the same, and shall for that purpose have all the powers which may be conferred upon commissioners under the act respecting inquiries concerning public matters; and the judge shall, with all convenient speed, report to the council the result of the inquiry, and the evidence taken thereon.\u201d\nUnder this provision, the council of the city of Toronto passed resolutions reciting that one Lackie, an officer of the corporation, had been guilty of malfeasance and breach of trust in his position of inspector of materials furnished for work done for the city by contractors, and specifying instances of such malfeasance, one of them being that the plaintiff had been allowed to furnish material inferior to that called for by his contract, and the county court judge was directed to make an inquiry with a view of ascertaining the truth of the allegations against Lackie, and also:\n\u201c2. To investigate and inquire into every matter and thing connected in any manner with the past or present relations which may have existed or do exist between the city of Toronto, contractors and officials, and other persons who are or who have been connected with this corporation, and which relations might or may tend to unduly influence the action of the said officials and persons in favor of said contractors when dealing with them on behalf of the city.\u201d\n\u201c3. To investigate and inquire into and ascertain whether contractors or other persons wrongfully obtained from the city of Toronto payment of moneys by deception, fraud or other unlawful means, and if so, who are the parties, and to what amount were such moneys obtained unlawfully.\u201d\n\u201c4. To investigate and inquire into the whole system of tendering, awarding, carrying out, fulfilling and inspecting contracts made with the city of Toronto, and to ascertain whether the present system and conduct of that part of the public business has been or is defective, and that the said county judge do report to this council on as early a day as possible the result of the inquiry into the matters and things referred, and the evidence taken therein.\u201d\nThe judge proceeded to hold an inquiry as directed by these resolutions, and notice was given to plaintiff that certain contracts in which he had been interested would be taken up and investigated on a day named. The plaintiff and his counsel attended the inquiry in pursuance of this notice and claimed that specific charges of misconduct should be formulated which the judge refused to direct.\nEventually the plaintiff, on being informed that the judge intended to proceed to Chicago and take evidence of a witness there who had formerly been in plaintiff\u2019s employ, applied to Mr. Justice Robertson for a writ of prohibition to restrain from further prosecuting the inquiry otherwise than as to the acts and conduct of Lackie, the officer of the corporation named in the resolution. Mr. Justice Robertson granted the writ[4], but his decision granting it was afterwards reversed by the Court of Appeal[5]. From the judgment of the latter court the plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and T.P. Gall for appellant. As to prohibition generally see Rex v.

RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I am clearly of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Appeal, in reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Robertson who had granted a writ of prohibition in this case, was right and should not be disturbed. The proceeding before the county court judge was, in my opinion, in no sense a judicial proceeding. The city was empowered by law to issue the commission to the county judge to make the inquiries directed in this case. The object of such inquiry was simply to obtain information for the council as to their members, officers and contractors, and to report the result of the inquiry to the council with the evidence taken, and upon which the council might in their discretion, if they should deem it necessary, take action. The county judge was in no way acting judicially; he was in no sense a court; he had no powers conferred on him of pronouncing any judgment, decree or order imposing any legal duly or obligation whatever on the applicant for this writ, nor upon any other individual. The proceeding for prohibition in this case was, therefore, wholly unwarranted, and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER and TASCHEREAU JJ. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014By sec. 477 of the Municipal Act, ch. 184, of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, it is enacted that[22]\nNow, the powers thus imported into the above act from the act respecting inquiries concerning public matters, ch. 17 R.S.O., are:\nThe power of summoning before the judge any party or witnesses, and of requiring them to give evidence on oath, orally or in writing, or on solemn affirmation if they be parties entitled to affirm in civil matters, and to produce such documents and things as the judge shall deem requisite to the full investigation of the matters referred to him to inquire into; and the same power to enforce the attendance of witnesses, and to compel them to give evidence and produce documents and things as is vested in any court in civil cases; but no party or witness shall be compelled to answer any question by his answer to which he might render himself liable to a criminal prosecution.\nNow, it is to be observed that the person authorized to make whatever inquiry is authorized is designated in his official character only as \u201cthe judge of the county court of the county in which the municipality is situate,\u201d and the subjects which he is, by the statute, authorized in this very exceptionable manner to inquire into, and the powers which are vested in him in relation to such matters, are, as it seems to me, twofold; the first affecting the persons whose conduct is to be inquired into, and the second affecting the system, practice, or procedure in use in the conduct of the affairs of the municipality, with a view to the improvement of such system, practice or procedure, if necessary, for the good government of the municipality It is with the first of these alone, namely, the powers vested in the corporation and the judge as affecting persons, that we are concerned in the present case. With reference to the persons affected by the act the resolution which the council is authorized to pass in order to put in motion against them the functions by the act vested in the judge is a resolution requesting him to investigate some matter to be mentioned in the resolution of the nature of malfeasance, breach of trust, or other misconduct supposed to have been committed either by a member of the council, or by some officer of the corporation, or by some person having a contract with the corporation. Legislation of this nature so open to abuse as, in view of the matters in contestation here, and of the construction put upon it on behalf of the respondents, it appears to me to be, should, in my judgment, be so construed as as to confine the powers proposed to be conferred by the act within the strictest construction of its letter. Now, in order to give to the judge any jurisdiction to exercise any of the powers vested in him by the act the resolution of the council must, as it appears to me, specify some act, matter or thing, either in the nature of malfeasance, breach of trust, or other named misconduct, which is charged as supposed to have been committed by some named member of council, or officer of the corporation, or person having a contract with the corporation. A resolution, for example, requesting the judge to inquire whether any malfeasance, breach of trust or other misconduct had been committed by any member of council or officer of the corporation, or any person having a contract with the corporation, would be absolutely void, and under such a resolution the judge would not become vested with any jurisdiction over any person under the act. To call into action the functions vested in the judge by the act some specific matter, act or thing of the nature of malfeasance, breach of trust, or other misconduct must, in my judgment, be mentioned in the resolution as being alleged as supposed to have been committed by some named member of council, officer of the corporation, or person having a contract with the corporation, and no other person is affected by the resolution, nor is any of the above persons, except as to such matters as are specifically stated in the resolution as being supposed to have been committed by some or one of the persons named in the resolution as and being either a member of the council, an officer of the corporation, or person having a contract with the corporation. The act does not, in my opinion, authorize any inquiry in this extraordinarily exceptionable manner into the conduct of a person who had been, but no longer was at the time of the resolution being passed, a member of the council or officer of the corporation, or into the conduct of J any person who may have had, but no longer had when the resolution invoking the judge\u2019s jurisdiction was passed, any contract with the corporation, nor into the conduct of any person, although having then a contract with the corporation, in relation to a contract which such person previously had had, but which was then finally determined. It was not the object of the act, in my opinion, that this exceptionable jurisdiction should be invoked for the purpose of inquiry into the conduct of persons having had contracts with the corporation which were completed and finally settled, it may be for years; for if the jurisdiction extends to affect a contract which had been closed and determined six months previously, it might equally be invoked in relation to the conduct of a person who had had a contract with the corporation which had been closed five or ten years previously to the passing of the resolution of council, to put in action the jurisdiction of the judge.\nThen, again, in order to exercise such jurisdiction as is vested in the judge by the act he is empowered to summon before him any party and witnesses, and to require them to give evidence on oath or affirmation, and to produce such documents as the judge shall deem necessary for the full investigation of the matters referred to him; and for that purpose, all the powers vested in any court in civil cases are vested in him, including committal for contempt, for disobedience of the summons or subpoena issued by the judge,\nbut no party or witness shall be compelled to answer any question by his answer to which he might render himself liable to a criminal prosecution.\nThe word \u201cparty,\u201d as twice used in the above sentence as applied to sec. 477 of ch. 184 R.S.O, plainly means, in my opinion, the member of council, officer of the corporation, or person having a contract with the corporation, who is charged with having committed some malfeasance, breach of trust or misconduct \u201cin relation to some duty or obligation,\u201d due by such party to the municipality, and whose conduct in breach of such duty or obligation is to be inquired into. The power thus vested in the judge of summoning any party before him is one which, in my opinion, it is imperative upon him to exercise before he can acquire any jurisdiction to inquire into the charge or complaint against such person referred to the judge to be inquired into, because it is contrary to the principles of natural justice, and to the course pursued \u201cby any court in civil cases,\u201d that any person should be subjected against his will to any jurisdiction in any person to inquire into his conduct in respect of any matter, and to have evidence taken against him, unless he should be given notice of the particular nature of the charge or complaint made against him, and which he has to meet, and of the time and place of the taking of the evidence against him in relation thereto. As the statute vests in the judge the same powers as are vested \u201cin any court in civil cases,\u201d it must be intended that these powers shall be exercised in the same manner as those powers are exercised by all courts of justice in civil cases.\nThen upon the evidence given upon oath after due inquiry made the \u201cjudge\u201d is required to report to the council the result of the inquiry, and the evidence taken thereon. Now, what possible meaning can be attached to these words, \u201cthe result of the inquiry,\u201d unless it be the opinion or judgment formed by the \u201cjudge\u201d as to the just and legal conclusion from the evidence, which the \u201cjudge,\u201d as a person qualified by His judicial mind to give, is to report to the council, namely, whether the malfeasance, breach of trust, or other misconduct charged against the person whose conduct in relation to some duty or obligation owed by him to the municipality has been inquired into by the \u201cjudge,\u201d has or has not been established by the evidence; in other words, whether the party accused was or was not in the opinion and judgment of the \u201cjudge,\u201d proved to have been guilty of the malfeasance, breach of trust or other misconduct whereof he was accused? If he was, although true it is that the judge was not empowered to inflict any punishment as consequential upon the opinion or judgment which he had formed as to the guilt of the accused, still the corporation, upon whose behalf the inquiry was made, had such power, as for example, by removal from office of an officer of the corporation, if the accused was an officer of the corporation, or by disqualifying a person having a contract with the corporation, if such a person was the accused, from having any other contract with the corporation. So that although the judge was not himself empowered to inflict any punishment upon the accused as a consequence of his being, in his opinion and judgment, guilty of the malfeasance, breach of trust or misconduct charged, still, as the result of the conclusion so arrived at by the judge, the accused would be subjected to serious consequences affecting his reputation and his business, and to injuries of a pecuniary nature which the corporation might inflict as the result of the opinion and judgment formed by the judge upon the evidence. Now, as regards the observations of Lord Justice Brett in The Queen v. The Local Government Board[23], that learned Lord Justice did not say that the jurisdiction of the superior courts over persons vested with limited authority by parliament is confined to cases in which the limited authority is in the nature of a power to impose some obligation upon individuals, and if that was a principle that he was laying down there cannot, I think, be any doubt that the power to subject individuals to pecuniary loss or obligations at the hands of others as the result of the actions of the persons invested with the limited authority would be equally within the principle. But the learned Lord Justice laid down no such principle. He was dealing simply with the case then before the court, and applying his observations to it. The Penarth Local Board had power in certain circumstances to impose pecuniary obligations upon individuals and in the particular case had done so. The person affected had appealed to the Local Government Board, insisting that this Board had a right to review the action of the Penarth Board, and to bind or loose the obligation imposed by the Penarth Board, and invoked the interposition of the Local Government Board to relieve the appellant from the action of the Penarth Board. The latter Board moved for a prohibition. The Court of Queen\u2019s Bench refused the writ. The Penarth Board appealed, insisting that the Local Government Board had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The Solicitor-General, on behalf of the Local Government Board, contended that the latter was not a judicial tribunal, that its functions were not of a judicial nature, and that, therefore, prohibition would not lie. It is to this contention that the Lord Justice adresses himself. After saying that it was asserted by the Solicitor-General upon behalf of the Local Government Board, among other things,\nthat the Board was not a body against which a prohibition can lie, that is, if they exceed their jurisdiction they are not a tribunal or set of persons against whom prohibition will lie at all,\nhe says that, in the view he took of the case, it was not necessary to decide that point, such view being that the statute did give an appeal to the Local Government Board in the case, and that in entertaining the appeal, they would be acting within their jurisdiction, and he adds:\nI think I am entitled to say this, that my view of the power of prohibition at the present day is that the court should not be chary of exercising it, and that wherever the legislature entrusts to any body of persons, other than to the superior courts, the power of imposing an obligation upon individuals [that being the case then before him], the courts ought to exercises, as widely as they can, the power of controlling those bodies of persons if those persons admittedly attempt to exercise powers beyond the powers given to them by act of parliament.\nThe learned Lord Justice, in this manner, intimated his opinion to be that whether the persons exercising limited statutory authority be a judicial tribunal or be invested with judicial functions, in which case there could be no doubt that prohibition should lie if they exceeded their jurisdiction, or be a body of persons not exercising judicial functions but having statutory power to impose an obligation upon individuals, as in the case before him, prohibition would lie against such persons if they should exceed their jurisdiction equally as it would against persons, or a tribunal, exercising judicial functions with limited authority. Now, it is impossible, in my opinion, to entertain the contention that \u201cthe judge,\u201d in exercising the functions vested in him by the act under consideration, was not acting judicially. The matter is referred to him in his official name only\u2014\u201cthe judge of the county court.\u201d The matter authorized to be referred to him is in the nature of a complaint against a member of council, or officer of the corporation, or a person having a contract with the corporation, for some malfeasance, breach of trust or misconduct supposed to have been committed by such person in relation to some duty or obligation due from him to the municipality; the matter so referred requires a due inquiry, under oath; the judge is empowered to summon before him the party and witnesses, and to exercise all the powers vested in any court in civil cases for enforcing the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents, and being so empowered he is, in my judgment, bound to exercise the powers so vested in him in the same manner as they are exercised by a court of justice in civil cases. Upon the close of the inquiry, \u201cthe judge\u201d is bound to report to the corporation the judgment or opinion formed by him as to the charge or charges referred to him upon the evidence taken before him, and the result of that judgment or opinion, if unfavorable to the accused, may injuriously affect his character, reputation and business prospects, and subject him to pecuniary losses at the hands of the corporation; under all these circumstances, I cannot for a moment entertain a doubt that the judge was, by the act, invested with judicial functions in respect of the matter to be inquired into and reported on by him, and was required to proceed in a judicial manner, and that, therefore, he is subject to prohibition if he exceeded his jurisdiction, or did not exercise his jurisdiction in accordance with the due and ordinary course of procedure in courts of justice. The language of Lord Justice Fry, in Leeson v. The General Council of Medical Education[24] is, in my judgment, precisely applicable in the present case.\nWhat the statute under consideration authorizes, in substance, is that upon a resolution of council being passed requesting the judge of the county court to investigate some complaint of malfeasance, breach of trust or other misconduct mentioned in the resolution as having been committed by either a member of the council, an officer of the corporation, or a person having a contract with the corporation, in relation to the duties and obligations owed by such person to the municipality, the judge shall institute a due inquiry into such charges, upon oath, and for conducting such inquiry he is invested with the same powers as are vested in any court in civil cases to enforce the attendance of witnesses, the production of documents, & c., &c, and upon the close of the inquiry, he is required to report to the council the result of the inquiry. That is to say, he is to report his judgment upon the evidence of the guilt or innocence of such accused person of the charges or charge alleged against him in the resolution of council. Such report, if unfavorable to the accused, cannot fail to be attended with consequences injurious to his character and to his business prospects and pecuniary interests. Moreover, the corporation would have it in their power to give effect to the judge\u2019s report by removal of the officer, if the officer of the corporation was the accused person, or by disqualifying the person from ever having another contract with the corporation, if the accused person\u2019s business was that of a contractor and if he was a person having a contract with the corporation. A person who may be so injuriously affected in his pecuniary interests, his reputation and business prospects by the judgment formed by a \u201cjudge\u201d upon such an inquiry had before him must be entitled to have the inquiry conducted in a judicial manner, and \u201cthe judge\u201d presiding and making the inquiry and required to report his conclusions or opinion or judgment, or whatever else the result may be called, to the council who have power to act upon it must, beyond all doubt, in my opinion, be considered to be acting in a judicial capacity.\nIn the particular resolution before us it was an officer of the corporation who was accused of having been guilty of malfeasance, breach of trust, gross negligence and other misconduct, specially named in relation to his duties as such officer, namely, as inspector of works, and the judge was required to inquire and report to the council whether these charges were true or false. The resolution of council which prescribed the jurisdiction of the judge is as follows:[25] The resolution refers to the judge.\n1st. Certain specific matters charged upon, and affecting the conduct of, a named officer of the corporation; and\n2nd. Requests an inquiry into the general system pursued by the corporation in relation to the letting of contracts. The personal charges which the resolution of council purports to authorize the judge to inquire into and to report upon seem to me, I confess, very plainly to involve an inquiry into matters of a criminal nature amounting to charges of larceny, or obtaining money upon false pretences, and a conspiracy between Lackie, the officer, named, and Godson, and others not named but whom the judge was to identify and report their names, to defraud the corporation. If the judge should report that the charges were established before him, and such report should be well founded upon the evidence, it cannot, I think, be doubted that persons guilty of the matters charged would be liable to prosecution by indictment. Now, the Provincial Legislatures have, by their constitutions, no power whatever to legislate in any manner in relation to criminal matters otherwise than by establishing courts of criminal jurisdiction. How, then, can it be contended for a moment that when an act of a Provincial Legislature authorises the judge of a county court eo nomine to inquire into and to report upon matters involving charges of a criminal nature the judge can act otherwise than in his judicial capacity, and as a court of criminal jurisdiction\u2014a court of limited jurisdiction, it is true, but as a court of criminal jurisdiction specially constituted as such for the express purpose named? The only person named in the resolution, as being subjected as a party to the inquiry required to be instituted by \u201cthe judge\u201d is an officer of the corporation, William Lackie, into whose conduct, as inspector in relation to the particular matters specified in the resolution, the inquiry is directed. Whether all the charges made against him are made with that precision which would, under the terms of the statute, give the judge jurisdiction over him, personally, as an accused party guilty of some malfeasance, breach of trust, or misconduct in relation to the duties and obligations owed by him to the municipality, we are not concerned at present to inquire, for all that we have to deal with is the jurisdiction assumed to be exercised over Godson, the appellant in the present case, and with respect to him it is to be observed that not one of the personal charges referred to the judge to investigate and report upon is made against him as a party personally brought under the jurisdiction of the judge, and into whose conduct the statute has authorized any inquiry to be made, otherwise than in connection with the charges specified against Lackie. He is, it is true, named, and liable to be called and examined as a witness in relation to the charges secondly, fifthly, sixthly and eighthly made against Lackie, the officer of the corporation, subject to the qualification contained in the statute that he shall not be compelled to criminate himself. Lackie is the only person named in the resolution as having been guilty of any malfeasance, breach of trust, or other misconduct in relation to the duties and obligations which, as an officer of the corporation, he owed to the municipality, and the only person, therefore, into whose conduct in respect of the charges made, the \u201cjudge\u201d is, by the express provisions of the statute, authorized to make any inquiry. Godson is neither a member of council or officer of the corpora- tion, nor, so far as appears, a person having a contract with the corporation. The reference with respect to Lackie, under the paragraph of the resolution numbered \u201c1,\u201d however objectionably vague it may be in some respects, as to him is confined expressly into the truth or falsity of the charges previously recited in the resolution as made against him; it in no way affects Godson as a person whose conduct is submitted to the jurisdiction of the judge under the terms of the statute. The reference under the paragraph No. \u201c2\u201d is, in my judgment, altogether too vague to give the judge jurisdiction over any person. That reference does not appear to be authorized by the statute at all, for there is no allegation therein of any malfeasance, breach of trust, or other misconduct supposed to have been committed by any member of council, officer of the corporation, or a person having a contract with the corporation, such persons being the only persons whose conduct is, by the statute, submitted to and brought under the jurisdiction of \u201cthe judge.\u201d Paragraph No. 3 appears to be objectionable for the same reason, and because it professes to submit an inquiry whether frauds have been committed upon the corporation by some person or persons not named. Paragraph No. 4 relates to the system of awarding contracts, with which we are not concerned in the present case; and the result is that, in my judgment, Godson is not, by the resolution of reference, brought at all under the jurisdiction of \u201cthe judge,\u201d as a party having a contract with the corporation, or otherwise, and liable to have any conduct of his inquired into, either as being misconduct in relation to any duty or obligation owed by him to the municipality, or otherwise than as incidental to the charges against Lackie.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the learned judge of the county court erred in the conclusion arrived at by him in the very inception of the inquiry instituted by him under the above resolution of the council of the city of Toronto, that he was not acting in a judicial capacity in the exercise of the authority vested in him by the statute.\nIt appears by the affidavit of the appellant filed upon his motion for a writ of prohibition, and it is not denied, that at the opening of the investigation instituted by the judge he intimated that it was intended in the course of the investigation to inquire into different contracts and dealings which the appellant had had with the city of Toronto, and that he refused to direct any particulars of any charges of misconduct to be delivered to him. I am of opinion that the learned judge erred here also. 1st. Because no charges against Godson were within the terms of the statute as for malfeasance, breach of trust or other misconduct committed by him either as a member of council, an officer of the corporation or a person having a contract with the corporation, referred to the judge to be inquired into, and therefore the learned judge had no jurisdiction to institute the threatened investigation against Godson, and 2nd,\u2014if he had jurisdiction it was contrary to natural justice that any charge against him should be made the subject of inquiry which was not duly notified to him to enable him to meet it. The learned counsel for the corporation appears to have taken what appears to me to be a singular view of the object and intent of the statute, for instead of regarding it as authorizing only an inquiry into some named charge against named persons of having been guilty of some malfeasance, breach of trust or other misconduct in violation of certain duties and obligations owed by such persons to the municipality, he seems to think that what the Legislature contemplated was a sort of secret fishing inquiry to be made by a judge for the purpose of ascertaining whether, at any time, any malfeasance, breach of trust, or other misconduct had been ever committed by any person formerly, but no longer, a member of council, or by any person formerly, but no longer, an officer of the corporation, or some person who formerly had, but no longer had, a contract with the corporation, for he says, in an affidavit filed by him, that he was informed by the judge that his duties would be to assist the judge, and under his direction, so far as might be necessary, to make inquiries and ascertain what evidence could be obtained bearing upon the matters under investigation and to cause the same to be brought before the judge, and he adds:\u2014\nIt has been and will be necessary in the progress of the said investigation to call witnesses whose evidence I cannot beforehand ascertain, and to inquire into matters where the facts are only partially known or even only suspected, and if I were compelled to take counsel for the parties interested in the results of this investigation into my confidence beforehand, and to disclose to them the object I had in view in making the said inquiries, and calling the said evidence, I have strong belief the result would be to defeat the object the investigation has in view.\nThe object of the investigation, and of the legislature in authorising the investigation authorized by it, would thus seem to be assumed to be that the judge of the county court should be empowered, with the assistance of a counsel employed by the corporation, to make inquiries whether any charge of malfeasance or misconduct can be discovered against a person who formerly had had a contract with the corporation, in relation to such contract, although such person is not charged, in the resolution of council which puts the judge in motion, with any malfeasance or misconduct in relation to such contract, instead of being simply to investigate such charges of malfeasance or misconduct as are mentioned in the resolution of council and with being guilty of which the person therein also mentioned is accused. I can only say that I am surprised that any person should construe the terms used in the statute as justifying such a species of investigation.\nThen, we find that the first inquiry made by the learned judge was not at all into any one of the charges mentioned in the resolution as made against Lackie, and which were referred to the judge to inquire into, but for the purpose of discovering whether any complaint could be made against Godson in respect of a certain contract which he had had with the corporation in relation to what is called the Eastern Avenue Bridge. The learned judge, Mr. Justice Robertson, before whom the motion for prohibition was made, and who had before him all the evidence taken before the judge of the county court, says that in 71 pages of large foolscap type writing taken upon this inquiry there was not a title of evidence that Lackie had anything whatever to do with the subject then under inquiry. I entirely concur with Mr. Justice Robertson that this inquiry into the Eastern Avenue Bridge contract and work was altogether in excess of the jurisdiction vested in the judge, and that Godson was not bound to have submitted to it. He did, however, submit to it, and does not therefore now complain of it, but he does object to being exposed to any similar investigation into his conduct in respect of contracts he has had with the corporation which are not referred to the judge by the resolution of council under which he is proceeding. He appears to have been willing to have had his conduct in respect of such contracts investigated by the learned judge, although not brought within his statutory cognizance under the resolution of council, if only he should be given notice beforehand of the nature of any charge against him which is proposed to be investigated, but this having been refused, and because of some other extraordinary assumption of authority upon the part of the learned judge, he applied for the writ of prohibition.\nAfter the close of the investigation, which as I have said was, in my opinion, unauthorized, into the conduct of Godson in connection with what is called the \u201cEastern Avenue Bridge,\u201d Godson again applied for particulars of all charges against him, if the judge should assume to investigate any, and was again refused, and, thereupon, he declined to submit to or attend upon the investigation any longer. Thereafter, in his absence, a person whom Mr. Justice Robertson, not inappropriately it would seem, judging from a letter of his to Godson dated the 10th January, 1888, terms the \u201cInformer Cooper,\u201d is examined. With reference to this person it may be observed that this letter of his of the 10th January, 1888, seems to justify Godson\u2019s declaration on oath, that he believes it to have been written with the view of extorting blackmail from him, and further, that although from the letter itself the council of the municipality, by several of its members, appear to have been placed in possession of the information possessed, or alleged to be possessed, by this man Cooper before they passed the resolution of council of the 12th March, 1888, yet they did not make, in that resolution, any charge of malfeasance or misconduct against Godson, nor authorize any investigation into any such as having been committed by him in relation to any contract he had with the corporation. Again, after Godson had so withdrawn from attending the investigation which was instituted by the judge, and at the close of the month of May, 1888, a letter is written by the counsel acting for the corporation, under the direction of the judge, to the gentlemen who had acted as counsel for Godson on the inquiry to which he had submitted into the \u201cEastern Avenue Bridge\u201d matter as follows:\nDEAR SIRS,\u2014I hereby notify you that on Monday, at 2 p.m., I will make a special application to His Honor Judge McDougall to go on Wednesday to some place in the States to take the evidence of James Hardy in the investigation now pending in re the Board of Works. A large portion of the evidence taken is now ready and can be obtained from the reporter, Mr. Clarke, and the balance will be ready on Monday, and will, I think, sufficiently inform you of the points upon which I propose to examine Mr. Hardy. I also notify you that it is impossible to bring Mr. Hardy here, and if you desire to cross\u2011examine him, I will ask the judge to rule that you will have to do so immediately after the examination-in-chief is concluded. Yours,.............. .\nAnd on the 1st of June, 1888, the following:\nI propose to make an application to His Honor Judge McDougall to-morrow, to allow Mr. Cross to examine certain accounts in Mr. Godson\u2019s books, other than those that have been referred to in Cooper\u2019s evidence to date. By direction of His Honor, I give you notice that such application will be made. Yours,............... .\nThis assertion of a right to examine the books of a man in business, not for any evidence upon any specific matter as to which a contestation was pending in a court of justice, but to enable the corporation of the city of Toronto to discover whether they could find there any foundation whereon to raise a suspicion, or to rest a complaint, of some misconduct having been committed by Godson in relation to some contract he may have had with the corporation in years past, or to enable them to discover whether the information obtained from Cooper was reliable, seems to me, I must confess, to involve a most singular misapprehension of the statute in virtue of which the right was claimed. The statute invested the judge with only the same powers to compel production of documents as were possessed by courts of justice in civil cases; but it never has been heard that a court of justice exercised the right which has been here claimed over Godson\u2019s books unless in respect of some matter in contestation, or some litigation to which the person whose books are sought to be inspected is a party litigant, or without giving him an opportunity of stating whether he had any books in his possession containing any entries therein in relation to the matters in issue.\nThe Mr. Hardy referred to in the former of the above letters written by the counsel acting for the corporation, and whose evidence was proposed to be taken in Chicago against Godson, against whom no charge had been made, and in relation to some matters not specified, is another person who, as Godson swears, was in his employment formerly, and having been discharged by him, had attempted by threats to levy blackmail from him, and had written to him a threatening letter an extract from which he annexed to his affidavit.\nIt appears from the judgment of Mr. Justice Robertson that the evidence taken in this manner from Cooper and others extends over 143 pages of type-writing, and from the above letters from the counsel acting for the corporation, to the gentlemen who had been acting as counsel for Godson in the Eastern Avenue Bridge matter, it appears that a portion of this evidence, at least, how much we are not informed, related to charges made, not by the corporation, but by the witness Cooper and others against Godson personally. It is under these circumstances that he moved for the writ of prohibition, and I must say that I entirely concur with the able judgment of Mr. Justice Robertson, that a clear case for the interference of a court of justice by prohibition has been made out, and this, in my opinion, quite apart from the judgment in the case of The Queen v. Squier[26].\nOtherwise than as a witness against Lackie the learned judge did not, in my opinion, become invested with any jurisdiction over Godson, or acquire any authority to compel an inspection of his books in the manner asserted, which could have been for no other purpose than to fish for some ground of complaint against Godson, not to investigate one made against him for in the resolution of council none was made.\nIt is no answer now to the motion for the writ of prohibition to say as to the examination of Mr. Hardy in Chicago that the learned judge, after Mr. Justice Robertson had rendered his judgment, gave up the idea of taking Hardy\u2019s evidence in Chicago, and that his evidence has been otherwise obtained; this is but a portion of the grounds upon which the motion for prohibition rested, for if the investigation against Godson personally, against whom no charge has been made, is unauthorized, he surely must have a right to prevent his character from being assailed, and it may be defamed in this manner by malevolent persons with a corrupt intent. He must surely have a right also to claim relief from having his whole time occupied in watching, and that, too, it may be at very great expense, proceedings instituted, apparently, not to carry out the object expressed in the resolution of council but for the purposes of opening up all the transactions which Godson may have had with the corporation over a course of years, with the view to ascertain whether he may have been guilty of some misconduct in relation to some or one of those transactions; with the view, in short, of fishing for evidence, if any could be found, whereon to rest a charge against him. This is not, in my judgment, what the statute contemplated and has authorized, and as the learned judge has, in my judgment, clearly exceeded his jurisdiction in so instituting an inquiry into Godson\u2019s conduct, and as the counsel acting on behalf of the corporation still insist upon the right of carrying on the investigation in the manner it has been carried on, save only as to the taking of evidence outside of the Province of On- tario, I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs, and that the writ of prohibition should be issued in accordance with the judgment of Mr. Justice Robertson, prohibiting the judge to proceed in investigating any charges against, and from reporting upon the conduct of, Godson personally otherwise than in so far as his conduct in relation to the particular matters charged against Lackie, mentioned in the resolution of council of March 12th, 1888, warrants and requires.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I concur in the views expressed by the judges of the Court of Appeal, and am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Beatty, Chadwick, Blackstock & Galt.\nSolicitor for respondent, City of Toronto: C.R.W.

In 1880 F. having resigned F. S. was appointed Chief Engineer of the Intercolonial Railway and investigated amongst others the respondent's claim, and reported a balance in his favor of $120,371. Thereupon the respondent amended his petition and made a special claim for the $120,371, alleging that F.S.'s report or certificate was a final closing certificate within the meaning of the contract, which question was submitted for the opinion of the court by special case. This report was never approved of by the Intercolonial Railway Commissioners or by the Minister of Railways and Canals under 31 Vic. ch. 13 sec. 18. The Exchequer Court, Fournier J. presiding, held that the suppliant was entitled to recover on the certificate of F.S. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada,\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court, 1st. Per Ritchie C.J. and Gwynne J., that the report of F. S., assuming him to have been the Chief Engineer to give the final certificate under the contract, cannot be construed to be a certificate of the Chief Engineer which does or can entitle the contractor to recover any sum as remaining due and payable to him under the terms of his contract, nor can any legal claim whatever against the Government be founded thereon. 2nd.

S's. certificate.\nPer Strong and Taschereau JJ. (dissenting) that F.

That the office of Commissioners having been abolished by 37 Vic. ch. 15, and their duties and powers transferred generally to the Minister of Railways and Canals, the approval of the certificate was not a condition precedent to entitled the suppliant to claim the amount awarded to him by the final certificate of the Chief Engineer.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1];\nThe proceedings in this case were commenced in December, 1879, by a petition of right, by which the respondent claimed to recover a large sum of money under a contract made with him and the Commissioners of the Intercolonial Railway for the construction of section 18 of that railway.\nIn October, 1885, the respondent amended his petition of right by inserting paragraph 27a, which is as follows:\n\"27a.\u2014The Chief Engineer of said railway on or about the twenty-second day of June, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, duly certified to the Minister of Railways and Canals that the extra and additional works and other matters claimed for in the foregoing paragraphs hereinbefore contained, had been executed and done as extra and additional to the extent mentioned in Schedule \"C\" to this petition, and that the amounts in Schedule \"C\" hereto should be paid in respect thereof by your Majesty to your petitioner, and also certified that the original contract work had been executed, and that there should be paid by your Majesty to your petitioner in respect thereof the amount mentioned in said Schedule \"C\" and said Minister has not disapproved of said certificate, but has, as such Minister unduly, arbitrarily and improperly withheld his express approval of said certificate although a reasonable time for approving or disapproving thereof has elapsed, and your petitioner, not waiving but insisting upon his right to be paid the amount claimed in Schedule \"B,\" submits and claims that in any event he is entitled to be paid the amount set forth in Schedule \"C\" as aforesaid, and that the want of an express approval in writing of said certificate by the said Minister, as aforesaid, should not under the circumstances alleged be permitted to be pleaded or to avail as a defence to the claim for payment of the amount mentioned in said Schedule \"C.\"\n\"Your petitioner prays that his said claims may be adjudicated upon, upon the merits as to the facts, and that he be paid whatever amount upon inquiry shall be found due to him in respect thereof and interest and costs, and that if upon any defence of a purely technical or legal character pleaded herein, it is held that yonr petitioner cannot recover in respect of Schedule \"B\" hereto, then that your petitioner be paid the amount claimed in Schedule \"C\" herein and interest and costs.\"\nBefore proceeding upon the merits of the Petition of Right a special case was prepared for the opinion of the court and the following statement of admission signed by both parties:\n\"Statement of admission by both parties:\nThe only question to be argued, at this stage of the case, is as to whether the suppliant is entitled to recover on the certificate or report of Shanly referred to in clause 27a of the Petition of Right, reserving to the suppliant the right, if the court decide against him on that question, still to proceed on the other clauses of the petition for the general claim.\nIt is admitted:\n1. That the contract alleged in petition, paragraph one, was entered into as therein alleged, copy of which contract is produced marked \"A.\"\n2. That the suppliant began and prosecuted the works, and executed a large amount of work in respect of the contract and section 18 of the Intercolonial Railway.\n3.

Re R. H. McGreevy. Section 18.\nSir,\u2014Herewith I submit my report upon the claim made by Mr. McGreevy, for extra and additional work done by him under his contract, in the years 1870-1-2-3-4 and 5, which has been referred to me for investigation.\nThe original lump sum for which he contracted to complete the work was $648,600, being at the rate of $32,430 per mile for 20 miles, subject, however, to certain additions or deductions as the case might be, and as set forth in the contract.\nThe contract was entered into in July, 1870, and was to be completed in July, 1872, but owing to various causes, amongst others, as alleged, the difficulty in procuring men, it was not finally brought to a close until the end of 1875, and even then, not being quite completed, the Government after that date expended some $7,500 in addition to the payments previously made, as reported by Mr. Brydges in 1877.\nMr. McGreevy in May, 1877, filed a petition of right, by which he claimed a sum of $603,000 for extras; subsequently, in 1879, by schedule \"B,\" a copy of which is attached hereto (sheet \"A\"), he makes a claim for $839,557.40 for extra work over and above the lump sum of his contract, and including a sum of $45,000 as an alleged balance due on the contract proper.\nAfter carefully investigating the nature and foundation for the claim, and going fully into the evidence produced on behalf of the claimant and of the crown respectively, the full report of which as taken down in shorthand marked \"E,\" Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, is herewith submitted, I have come to the conclusion, owing to various unforeseen difficulties, and in view of the contract being for a lump sum, where the contractor was to assume all risks from weather, increase in the cost and scarcity of labor, the great difficulty in such a country of ascertaining previous to tendering the real nature of the material to be excavated, or the facilities for the procuring of stone, timber, &c., for building, most of which had to be brought from a great distance, that the deductions and additions provided for by the contract should be waived, and the lump sum on a final settlement be adhered to and allowed, together with certain items claimed by Mr. McGreevy as extra to and not properly belonging to the contract, and as set forth in sheet \"A\" herewith numbered 10, 11, 12, 18 and 19 respectively. All the other items mentioned in sheet \"A,\" except 20 and 21, afterwards referred to, I consider to be clearly covered by the contract and specification, and that no allowance should be made for them.\nItem 10. Second-class masonry built as first-class.\nFrom a personal examination of nearly all the structures referred to, as well as from the weight of the evidence produced in support of the claim, and given by skilled engineers and mechanics, most of whom were in the employment of the Government at the the time the work was being carried on, I am inclined to think that the claim is fairly established, in so far as the quantity so built is concerned; the price, however, should be only $6, not $9, per cubic yard, the former being the difference in the schedule rates, between first and second-class masonry; see sheet \"C\" attached hereto. I therefore recommend payment as follows of this item: 4,617 cubic yards, at $6, $27,702.\nItem 11, Portland cement used as ordered instead of hydraulic cement. This claim is fully supported by the evidence as to the fact, and it generally agrees that the additional cost was $1.50 per cubic yard; I would therefore pronounce it proved, and recommend payment therefor: 8,892 cubic yards, built in Portland cement, at an extra cost of $1.50 per cubic yard, $13,338. Item 12. Crib wharfing. Claim based upon the fact that the plans were entirely changed and enlarged from those exhibited at the time the tender was put in, and in fact that double the material then called for had to be used; that is, I think, fully proved in evidence, and I therefore recommend that payment be made proportionally at the rate of 75 cents per cubic yard, which is equivalent to $3 per lineal foot as tendered (see sheet \"C\" attached hereto) on the original plan. The total quantity is proved at 160,000 cubic yards, or say 20,000 lineal feet, containing 8 cubic yards per foot, less estimated and allowed in final estimate 80,600 cubic yards\u201479,400 cubic yards at 75 cents per cubic yard, $59,550.\nItem 18. Iron pipes in place. This item is properly extra to the contract, and I treat it as such. A price per lineal foot is stated in the schedule to the tender, but no mention is made of it either in the specification or bill of quantities. The length laid down, as shown by Mr. Grant's final measurement, is 424 lineal feet, and the quantity of masonry and concrete used is, I think, admitted, as is also the quantity of masonry saved by the substitution of the pipes for stone culverts. The account will then stand thus:\n424 lin. ft. iron pipes at $25\n$10,600\n352 c. yds. 1st class masonry at $14.\n4,928\n425 c. yds. concrete at $5\n2,225\n$17,753\nLess\u20142nd class masonry saved, 1,308 c. yds. at $8\n10,464\nRecommended to be paid\n$ 7,286\nItem 19. Iron pipes delivered but not used by the contractors.\nThis claim is not disputed, it having been recognized by Mr. Schreiber in his final estimate of November 1875. There seems to have been 219 lin. feet, 10 inches say 220 feet, left on the ground and taken by the Government. This would make as nearly as possible 100,000 lbs., which I have valued at 4 cents per lb.\n100,000 lbs. iron, pipes at 4 cts per lb\n$4,000\nThe foregoing items aggregate\n$111,879\nLump sum of contract\n648,600\nTotal amount with extras\n$760,479\nThere now only remains to be dealt with items 20 and 21.\nItem 20. Damage and delay at Millstream Bridge.\nThe evidence in support of this item, principally that of Mr. Grant and Mr. McGreevy himself, fails to make out, in my opinion, the case, and Mr. Bell and Mr. Fleming for the crown most emphatically deny that there were any grounds for such a claim, I cannot therefore recommend its being entertained.\nItem 21. Two additional miles over the length (20 miles) tendered for.\nIt was so obvious that the lump sum of $648,600 was based on a distance of 20 miles, and not 18 as claimed, the mileage price, $32,430 being distinctly mentioned, that in an early part of the investigation Mr. McGreevy through his counsel consented to withdraw it.\nThe principal witnesses to the above items were for item 10, Messrs. J. D. Cameron, Charles Odell, A. L. Light, Peter Grant and R. A. McGreevy, in support; and Messrs. Bell and Fleming against.\nFor item 11, Messrs. Cameron, Lourie, Imlay, Grant, and McGreevy in support; and Messrs. Bell and Fleming against.\nFor item 12, Messrs. Michaud, Odell, Townsend, Grant and McGreevy in support; and Messrs. Bell and Fleming against.\nItems 18 and 19 not disputed. Evidence documentary. On the general principles and interpretation of the contract, Mr. C. J. Brydges was called and examined by the crown. He referred chiefly to a report made by him on this case in June, 1877, in reply to the petition of right, recommending that the strict letter of the contract be adhered to, this doubtless is perfectly correct in law, but I cannot help thinking that the present is a class of case where a little equity may very properly be introduced.\nI have nothing further to add, the claim for extras to the extent of $111,879 has I think, been satisfactorily proved, which sum added to the lump sum of the contract $648,600 which I have before recommended, should be retained makes a total of $760,479 from which must be deducted the sums already paid to the contractor, or otherwise expended by the Government on the works, amounting to $640,108, leaving a balance in favour of the contractor of $120,371 as shown on sheet \"D,\" to which sum I think he is fairly entitled.\nI am, sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n(Signed) F. Shanly,\nChief Engineer, I. C. R.\"\nThe case having come on for trial, several witnesses were examined by the crown to prove that the report or certificate forwarded by Mr. Shanly had not been treated by the Minister of Railways and Canals, as a final certificate and that it had been repudiated and witnesses were adduced by the suppliant to show that Mr. Shanly's reports on other claims had been paid approved and the amount he had awarded had been paid.\nThe Exchequer Court of Canada, Fournier J. presiding, held that the certificate or report of Mr. F. Shanly was sufficient to entitle the suppliant to proceed before the court in order to recover the amount awarded to him by said certificate or report.\nThe parties having been heard subsequently before the judge, and the suppliant's counsel having declared that he renounced his claim for any surplus claimed by his petition over and above the amount certified to in the next report or certificate of Mr. F. Shanly, judgment was given for the suppliant for the sum of $65,058 and costs and the petition as to the excess was dismissed.\nThe crown then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nC. Robinson Q C. and Hogg Q. C. for appellant, and Girouard Q.C. and Ferguson Q.C. for respondent.\nThe statutes and clauses of the contract which bear upon the case are referred to at length in the report of the case in the Exchequer Court Reports[2], and in the judgments hereinafter given.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014The following is the statement of admission by both parties to this appeal:\n\"The only question to be argued at this stage of the case is as to whether the suppliant is entitled to recover on the certificate or report of Shanly referred to in the clause 27a of the petition of right, reserving to the suppliant the right, if the court decide against him on that question, still to proceed on the other clauses of the petition for the general claim.\"\nThe suppliant does not seem to contend that he was not bound to have, under the contract, a final certificate of the Chief Engineer, but he alleges that the certificate given by Mr. Shanly was such final certificate and that he was not bound to obtain the approval of the Minister, standing in the place of the Commissioners with whom the contract was made, as to the certificate of Mr. Shanly. This, in my opinion, cannot bo considered, in any sense of the term, such a certificate as the contract and the statute contemplate and which the crown, on a strict legal interpretation of the contract, has a right to insist upon. Mr. Shanly, as his report or certificate shows, has come to the conclusion, for certain reasons such as \"owing to various unforeseem difficulties, and in view of the contract being for a lump sum where the contractor was to assume all risks from weather, increase in the cost and scarcity of labor, the great difficulty in such a country of ascertaining previous to tendering the real nature of the material to be excavated, or the facilities for the procuring of stone, timber, etc., for building, most of which had to be brought from a great distance, that the deductions and additions provided for by the contract should be waived.\"\nAnd at the conclusion of the report he says:\u2014\nOn the general principles and interpretation of the contract Mr. C.J. Bydges was called and examined by the Crown. He referred chiefly to a report made by him on this case in June, 1877, in reply to the petition of right recommending that the strict letter of the contract be adhered to. This, doubtless, is perfectly correct in law, but I cannot help thinking that the present is a class of case where a little equity may very properly be introduced.\nWhat does the contract require?\nOn the complet on of the whole work to the satisfaction of the engineer a certificate to that effect shall be given.\nAnd section 18 of the Intercolonial Railway Act provides that\u2014\nNo money shall be paid to any contractor until the Chief Engineer shall have certified that the work for, or on account of, which the same shall be claimed has been duly executed, nor until such certificate has been approved by the Commissioners.\nAssuming Mr. Shanly to have been the Engineer in Chief entitled to give the final certificate under the contract it is, in my opinion, quite impossible to suppose that Mr. Shanly could have thought that he was giving such a certificate. What right had he to waive the provisions of the contract? What right had he to depart from the strict letter of the contract which he, himself, says it was perfectly correct, in law, to adhere to? What right had he to introduce what he is pleased to term a little equity into the case? Or what right has any court to eliminate from this case the express provisions of instruments intended to protect the public revenues of the country and prevent the payment of any moneys to contractors until approved of by the commissioners or the Minister of Railways now representing the Commissioners? The contract must be read in connection with this provision which cannot, in my opinion, be ignored. So far from Mr. Shanly's report being treated as a final certificate and approved of, the evidence of the Minister of Railway, representing the Commissioners, is distinct and positive that so far from being approved of it was distinctly repudiated, and instead of being accepted a commissioner was appointed to enquire into and report on suppliant's claim with others before the commissioner. The suppliant appeared, and, with the crown, produced witnesses, and which Commissioner awarded the suppliant a certain sum which was paid him, and, in my opinion, this should have ended the matter.\nHad it been expressly stipulated by the contract that the money should be paid on the final certificate without the approval of the Commissioners or Minister, &., would not this provision, being in direct violation of the statute, be void, and the contract be governed by the statute which gives them no power to dispense with this important stipulation?\nUnless I am prepared to go back on the case of Jones v. The Queen[3] and to hold that was wrongly decided, which I am by no means prepared to do, I must hold that the suppliant has failed to establish his case and that this appeal must be allowed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The questions to be primarily decided on this appeal are: First, whether Mr. Frank Shanly was at the time he made his report or certificate of the 22nd June, 1881, the Chief Engineer of the Intercolonial Railway; and secondly, whether that certificate is to be regarded as a final and closing certificate within the meaning of the contract. The learned judge who presided at the hearing of this petition of right in the Exchequer Court decided both these points in favor of the suppliant and I am of opinion that his decision was in these respects entirely right.\nThe Order in Council of the 23rd June, 1880, was made upon the report of the Minister of Railways and Canals, stating that Mr. Sanford Fleming declined the appointment and recommending that Mr. Shanly be appointed to be Chief Engineer of the Intercolonial Railway. The Order in Council by which the recommendation of the Minister of Railways and Canals was approved by the Governor General constituted the instrument of appointment by virtue of which Mr. Shanly held the office and exercised the authority and performed the duties appertaining to it. This Order in Council certainly states that \"the engagement should be understood to be of a temporary character,\" but it is not suggested that Mr. Shanly's appointment had been revoked or his tenure of office in any way interfered with at the time he made the certificate or report of the 22nd June, 1881. This Order in Council therefore, in my opinion, invested Mr. Shanly with all the powers which, as was provided by the contract between the crown and the Suppliant were to be exercised by the Chief Engineer of the Inter-colonial Railway, at least so far as the same remained unperformed by his predecessor in office. Had the Engineer originally appointed died it cannot be doubted that it would have been competent for the Governor General in Council to appoint a successor who could properly perform such functions remaining unperformed as the contract assigned to the Engineer, and I can see no reason why there should be any difference in this respect between a vacancy so caused by death and that which was actually caused by the resignation of Mr. Fleming. There is nothing in the appointment of Mr. Shanly which is not in strict conformity with the provisions of the act respecting the construction of the Intercolonial Railway. (31 Vict. c. 13) sec. 4 of which is as follows:\nThe Governor General shall and may appoint a Chief Engineer to hold office during pleasure who under the instructions he may receive from the Commissioners shall have the general superintendence of the works to be constructed under this act.\nAs I have said I see no reason why, in the case of the death of the original Chief Engineer during the progress of the works or after their completion, a Chief Engineer should not be appointed by whom the certificates required by sec. 11 of the contract might well be given. The fact that the works were not constructed under the superintendence of such secondly appointed Chief Engineer would not, as it seems to me, make any difference; and if such a new appointment might be made in the case of the death of the original Engineer no reason can be suggested why the same course might not be followed in the case of his resignation or refusal to accept a re-appointment.\nNext we have to inquire whether the report or certificate of Mr. Shanly dated the 22nd June, 1881, was a final and closing certificate such as is required by the 11th section of the contract. I am of opinion that it was. The Intercolonial Railway Act (31 Vic. c. 13 sec. 18) provides that:\nNo money shall be paid to any contractor until the Chief Engineer shall have verified that the work for or on account of which the same shall be claimed has been duly executed, nor until such certificate shall have been approved of by the Commissioners.\nThe eleventh clause of the contract is as follows:\u2014\nAnd it is further mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto that cash payments equal to eighty-five (85) per cent of the value of the work done approximately made up from returns of progress measurements will be made monthly on the certificate of the Engineer that the work for, and on account of, which the sum shall be certified has been duly executed and upon approval of such certificate by the Commissioners. On the completion of the whole work to the satisfaction of the Engineer a certificate to that effect will be given, but the final and closing certificate including the fifteen per cent. retained will not be granted for a period of two months thereafter. The progress certificates shall not in any respect be taken as an acceptance of the work or the release of the contractor from his responsibility in respect thereof, but he shall at the conclusion of the work deliver over the same in good order according to the true intent and meaning of the contract and of the said specifications.\nIt will be observed that this clause makes mention of three different certificates, first those which are called \"progress certificates,\" to be given by the Engineer during the continuance of the work, being based on an approximate estimate of the work done and which, subject to a deduction of 15 per cent., were to be paid at once on the approval of the Commissioners. With these Mr. Shanly had, of course, nothing to do. Then there was a certificate which was to be given upon the completion of the whole work, a certificate that it had been so completed to the satisfaction of the Engineer. And lastly, there was a third certificate to be given by the Engineer, which is denominated the \"final and closing certificate\" and which was to include the 15 per cent. retained from the progress estimates. This last mentioned certificate is clearly a separate and distinct certificate from that secondly mentioned, for it is expressly provided that it is not to be granted for a period of two months after the completion of the works, while the second certificate is to be granted immediately upon completion. There is no reason, however, why these two certificates should not be blended in one, provided two months have elapsed after the completion of the works. I can see, therefore, no reason why we should not consider Mr Shanly's report as embracing both these certificates. As regards the completion of the works the report of Mr. Shanly is not very formal, but no one who reads the third paragraph of it can doubt that what he says implies that the works had been wholly completed to his satisfaction some years prior to the date of his report, and therefore much longer than two months before he gave his \"final and closing\" certificate, which, in my opinion, is also to be found in this report.\nThis brings us to the very important question: What meaning is to be attached to these words \"final and closing certificate?\" No doubt they at first seem general and vague but when taken and considered with reference to the other provisions of the contract I think they will be found not so vague as to be insusceptible of a reasonable interpretation.\nWhat then was this \"final and closing certificate\" to contain? It could not have been intended to relate to the completion of the work, for that was to be dealt with by the second certificate which it was for the Engineer to give as soon as the work was completed, whilst the final and closing certificate was not to be given until two months after, completion. It would have been entirely unnecessary and superfluous for the purpose of ascertaining the balance due to the contractor if the contract price was to be strictly adhered to and that was to be the sole measure of the contractors' remuneration, for that price being what is called a lump sum was written in the contract itself, so that the balance due to the contractor would have been ascertainable by a mere deduction of the aggregate of the payments made on progress certificates from the contract price, and no certificate from the Engineer would be required for that purpose there being no measurements or quantities to be taken, and such a calculation could be more appropriately and easily made by the officers who had charge of the accounts of the works than by the Engineer. We must, therefore, find some other object for the certificate in question than any of these purposes. Now the words \"final\" and \"closing,\" even strictly construed, indicate that this certificate was to put an end to some matters which might remain open or in dispute after all questions relating to the completion and sufficiency of the work had been concluded by the other certificate as to final completion, and when the ascertainment of the balance remaining due in respect of the contract price was reduced to a mere matter of calculation, a simple sum of addition of the amounts paid from time to time in progress certificates and of the subtraction of the result from the fixed contract price.\nThen what could possibly remain open or in dispute between the contractor and the crown but claims made by the former in respect of additional or extra work performed by him in excess of that required by the specifications? This is the only possible object or purpose for which a \"final\" and \"closing\" certificate could have been required, the bringing to an end and closing claims for work performed extra the contract. And when we consider that as the contractor was not entitled to be paid a dollar even of the unpaid residue of the contract price until he procured a certificate of the Engineer which (as many cases decided in this court relating to contracts on this same Intercolonial Railway have established) was an indispensable condition precedent to his being paid, it was not unreasonable or unfair, more especially when we remember that the Engineer's certificate was originally to be approved by the Commissioners, that the contractor should have the benefit of a conclusive determination of claims made by him, just as the crown reciprocally had the right to have any complaints which it might make of defaults on the part of the contractor adjudicated upon in the same way by the Engineer before he gave his certificate respecting the completion of the works. Moreover, such a clause is of such universal use in building and railway construction contracts that a contract which did not contain a similar provision would be out of the usual course. I should, therefore, if this clause eleven stood alone, having regard to the fact that the contract price was a fixed sum and not one to be ascertained by the measurement of quantities and work, have considered that it was intended to give to the Engineer (subject to the approval of the Commissioners) the most full and absolute power to determine what claims of the contractor should be admitted and what should be rejected. It is, however, suggested that inasmuch as claims for extra work are expressly excluded by clause nine of the contract it was impossible that the final and closing certificate of the Engineer could have any reference to such claims. I cannot, however, accede to this view. No doubt the ninth clause is framed in terms which would, if there was nothing more in the contract, disentitle the contractor to make any claim for what was strictly \"extra work,\" that is work incidental to that which was called for by the specifications, not, however, to work which was entirely additional, but if there had been added to that clause an exception in express words of such claims for extras as the Chief Engineer by his final and closing certificate (to be approved by the Commissioners) might allow, there could have been no doubt but that a claim like the present would not be excluded by the ninth clause.\nThen in construing the contract we are not only entitled but bound to have regard to the whole of it, and not to adopt a narrow construction derived from a single clause; it is, therefore, according to sound rules of interpretation open to us to consider whether such an exception as I have just supposed is contained in some other part of the instrument under consideration. And we may be bound to read such an exception into the contract even though it is not contained in express words but is to be derived from clear and necessary implication. These are general principles of construction which no one can dispute, and the only difficulty (if any there be) which can arise here, is in their application to the instrument we have to construe. Now if we had found in the eleventh clause in connection with the provision for this \"final and closing certificate,\" words indicating that it should be conclusive as regards claims for extra and additional work, we should have no alternative open to us but to construe them as an exception to the rigorous exclusion of any claim fo extras contained in the ninth clause. No one will deny that the ninth clause would in the case I put be thus controlled and cut down. Then if from necessary implication we find that the only reasonable and sensible meaning which can be given to these words describing the Engineer's certificate as one which is to be \"final and closing\" that is conclusive of some matters which were in controversy between the contractor and the crown, and if it is demonstrated that there could be no other matters to which this final certificate by the Chief Engineer could possibly apply we do shew by necessary implication that this certificate was by the plain intention indicated by the contract to be one embracing just such claims as have been dealt with by Mr. Shanly in his certificate and report, and consequently we are bound to read the eleventh clause as containing an exception to the ninth clause by expanding the words \"final and closing,\" to mean just what would have been meant if it had been expressly said that the certificate was to be conclusive as to extras.\nAs this contract was to be performed in the Province of Quebec I am of opinion that it should properly be construed according to the law of that Province. Having, however, satisfied myself that this would be the strict and proper construction of the contract according to the rules applied by English courts in the construction and exposition of written instruments, I need not refer to the far wider and more liberal principles applied by courts administering French law in the interpretation of contracts and in arriving at the intentions of the parties when clauses of a harsh or unusual nature are under consideration. Therefore Mr. Shanly having been, as I have already said, \"The Chief Engineer,\" within the contract and the statute I am of opinion that his certificate did not include matters beyond his jurisdiction, and that in all other respects the document in the form of a letter or report signed by him and dated the 22nd of June, 1881, complied with the requisites of a final and closing certificate as called for by the eleventh clause of the contract.\nIt is, however, provided by the 18th section of the act (31 Vic. c. 13) that no money shall be paid except upon the certificate of the Chief Engineer \"nor until such certificate shall have been approved of by the Commissioners,\" and it is objected that there has been no such approval in the present case. Of course, the first and obvious answer to this objection is that there were no Commissioners to give their approval when Mr. Shanly made his certificate. It is, however, said that by the statute 37 Vic. ch. 15, the Minister has been substituted for the Commissioners. It is true that the powers of the Commissioners are generally transferred to the Minister, but according to well understood principles of statutory construction a statute will never be interpreted as having the effect of varying a contract and imposing new obligations and conditions on a contracting party unless such an intention is indicated by express words. Moreover the object of the approval of the Commissioners seems to have been to ensure financial control by them of the moneys voted by parliament for the construction of the railway, and this purpose would be subserved by other general provisions relating to all public works after the work came under the control of the Department.\nAs regards the objection that the suppliant waived his rights by going before the Commissioners of inquiry, I cannot assent to that. He appeared before that board under a most emphatic and distinct protest which was amply sufficient to protect him in that respect.\nThe acceptance of the money awarded by the Commissioners amounting to $84,075 cannot, in the face of the protest already mentioned, taken in connection with the letter of the suppliant to the Minister of Railways, dated the 18th of April, 1884, and the terms of the receipt of the 5th of May, 1884, signed by him upon the payment of the money, constitute any waiver or abandonment of his right to maintain this petition of right.\nI am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed and the judgment of the Court of Exchequer affirmed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred with Strong J. GWYNNE J.\u2014In this case the respondent, by petition of right, claimed to recover from the Dominion Government a large sum of money under a contract made with him under the act respecting the Intercolonial Railway for the construction of section 18 of that railway. The question now before us arises under the paragraph in the Petition of Right numbered 27a, which is as follows[4].\nThe work mentioned in this schedule \"C,\" and the amount claimed in respect thereof are, and the schedule itself is, as follows:\u2014\n4,617 c. yards masonry at $6\n$27,702\n8,892 do do in Portland cement, extra price, $1.50\n13,338\n9,400 c. yards crib work at 75c\n59,550\nIron pipes in culverts\n7,289\nIron pipes not used\n4,000\n$111,879\nContract price, lump sum\n648,600\nTotal\n$760,479\nAmounts deducted by Chief Engineer (in his certificate referred to in paragraph 27a) as payments on account according to report of Mr. Brydges. 1877\n640,108\nBalance\n$120,371\nNow, the only right in virtue of which the respondent could assert any claim against the Dominion Government is the contract set out in his petition of right for the construction of the portion of the Intercolonial Railway therein mentioned. Three paragraphs in that contract, namely, the 4th, 9th and 11th are material. The contract was for the complete construction of section 18 according to specifications thereto annexed for the lump sum of $648,600.\nThen it was provided by the above paragraphs as follows:\u2014 4. The Engineer shall be at liberty at any time before the commencement or during the construction of any portion of the work, to make any changes or alterations which he may deem expedient in the grades, the line of location of the railway, the width of cuttings or fillings, the dimensions or character of structures, or in any other thing connected with the works whether or not such changes increase or diminish the work to be done or the expense of doing the same, and the contractor shall not be entitled to any allowance by reason of such changes, unless such changes consist in alterations in the grades of the line of location, in which case the contractor shall be subject to such deductions for such diminution of work or entitled to such allowance for increased work (as the case may be), as the Commissioners may deem reasonable, their decision being final in the matter, &c., &c., &c.\n9. It is distinctly understood, intended and agreed that the said price or consideration of $648,600 shall be the price of and be held to be full compensation for all the works embraced in or contemplated by this contract, or which may be required in virtue of any of its provisions or by-law; and that the contractor shall not upon any pretext whatever be entitled by reason of any change, alteration or addition made in or to such works or in the said plans and specifications, or by reason of any of the powers vested in the Governor in Council by the said Act entitled: \"An Act respecting the construction of the Intercolonial Railway,\" or in the Commissioners or Engineer by this contract or by-law, to claim or demand any further or additional sum for extra work or as damages, the contractor hereby expressly waiving and abandoning all and any such claim or pretention to all intents and purposes whatsoever, except as provided in the 4th section of this contract.\n11. And it is further mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto that cash payments equal to 85 per cent. of the value of the work done, approximately made up from returns of progress measurements, will be made monthly on the certificate of the Engineer that the work for and on account of which the same shall be certified has been duly executed and upon approval of such certificate by the Commissioners. On the completion of the whole work to the satisfaction of the Engineer, a certificate to that effect will be given, but the final and closing certificate including the fifteen per cent. retained will not be granted for a period of two months thereafter. The progress certificates shall not in any respect be taken as an acceptance of the work or the release of the contractor from his responsibility in respect thereof, but he shall at the conclusion of the work deliver over the same according to the true intent and meaning of the contract and of the said specifications. It is obvious, I think, from this contract that the certificate of the Chief Engineer on the completion of the whole work, that the work had been completed to his satisfaction, implied that it had been accepted as completed in accordance with the provisions of the contract. Such a certificate could operate so as to entitle the contractor in virtue of it alone to recover whatever balance of the lump sum agreed upon remained unpaid only in case no alterations whatever should have been made under the above fourth paragraph. In that case the balance due was easily ascertainable by deduction of the amounts paid under the progress estimates from the bulk sum for which the whole work had been agreed to be completed; but, in case any alterations had been made under the fourth paragraph nothing would be payable to the contractor in virtue of such a certificate of the Chief Engineer, nor until the calculations necessary to be made and approved in accordance with the provisions of the fourth paragraph should be made and approved as therein provided, for it is expressly agreed that the contractor shall have no claim whatever in such a case except under the provisions of the said fourth paragraph, and that the \"final and closing certificate\" shall not be granted until the expiration of two months after the Engineer shall have given his certificate that the work has been completed to his satisfaction.\nIn the case before us the claim is that many alterations had been made within the provisions of the fourth paragraph of the contract, so that the certificate of the Chief Engineer that the work had been completed to his satisfaction would not in itself entitle the contractor to recover any part of the amount claimed by him in his petition of right. He could only recover whatever sum, if any, should be ascertained as being due to him upon a calculation being made in accordance with the provisions of the fourth paragraph, and so far from anything having ever been found due to him under that paragraph in excess of what he has already received, it appears, incidentally, that the Commissioner, the late Mr. Brydges, in 1877, reported that he had been overpaid; but, however this may be, the contention now is that the contractor, in June, 1881, became entitled in virtue of a report then made to the Minister of Railways by the late Mr. F. Shanly, then Chief Engineer of the Intercolonial Railway, to recover the sum of $120,371.\nNow, Mr. Shanly became Chief Engineer of the Intercolonial Railway under the circumstances and for the purpose hereinafter stated.\nIn the month of June, 1880, the Minister of Railways presented to his Excellency the Governor General in Council a report in the terms following:\u2014\nOttawa, 21st June, 1880.\nThe undersigned has the honor to report that a letter has been received from Mr. Sandford Fleming wherein he states that for reasons given he is under the necessity of declining the position of Chief Engineer of the Intercolonial Railway and Consulting Engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway to which by Order in Council of the 22nd May last he has been appointed.\nThe undersigned accordingly recommends that authority be given for the appointment of Mr. Frank Shanly, C.E., as Chief Engineer of the Intercolonial Railway for the purpose of investigating and reporting upon all unsettled claims in connection with the construction of the line, and that his salary while so engaged be fixed at $541.66 a month, the engagement being understood to be of a temporary character.\nRespectfully submitted,\n(Signed) Charles Tupper,\nMinister of Railways and Canals.\nThis report was approved by His Excellency in Council on the 23rd June, 1880, and thereupon Mr. Shanly became Chief Engineer of the Intercolonial Railway for the purpose above stated.\nAt this Lime the only question pending between the respondent and the Government was whether there was any, and if any what, amount remaining due by the Government to the respondent under his contract for the construction of the Intercolonial Railway which had been in possession of and operated by the Government for some time.\nA mere certificate given by Mr. Shanly that the work had been completed to his satisfaction would have had, as already shewn, no operation in itself, nor would it have been of any use for the purpose of determining the point in difference between the respondent and the Government, namely, whether there was any, and if any what, sum still remaining due to the contractor under and in accordance with the provisions of his contract.\nAssuming the Government to have been willing to accept Mr. Shanly's own calculation made in accordance with the provisions of the fourth paragraph of the contract in substitution for the approval and decision of the Commissioners as required by that paragraph, or that the Minister of Railways was competent to do what by that paragraph was submitted to the decision of the Commissioners, still Mr. Shanly never did, in point of fact, make any calculation such as was directed to be made by the above fourth paragraph. Indeed, from his report it is obvious that he never understood that he was appointed for the purpose of giving, and that in point of fact he never contemplated giving and never did give, any certificate for the purpose of entitling the respondent thereunder to recover any part of the amount claimed by him as being due to him under the terms and provisions of the contract. So far from contemplating giving a certificate either that the work had been completed by the respondent, or that there was any sum remaining due to him under and in accordance with the provisions of the contract, he shews upon his report that the work had never been completed by the respondent, but that the Government had completed it themselves; and further that his report upon the respondent's claim submitted to him for investigation is not based upon the provisions of the contract, but upon the assumption that those provisions are waived; thus showing the report to be intended as a confidential communication and suggestion to the Government and not as a basis upon which any legal claim of the respondent under the terms of his contract could be rested. In that report, Mr. Shanly says:\nHerewith I submit my report upon the claim made by Mr. McGreevy for extra and additional work done by him under his contract, in tie years 1870-1-2-3-4 and 5, which has been referred to me for investigation.\nHe then proceeds\u2014\nThe original lump sum for which he contracted to complete the work was $648,600, being at the rate of $32,430 per mile for 20 miles, subject however to certain additions or deductions as the case might be set forth in the contract. The contract was entered into in July, 1870, and was to be completed in July, 1872, but owing to various causes (amongst others as alleged, the difficulty in procuring men,) it was not finally brought to a close until the end of 1875, and even then not being quite completed the Government after that date expended some $7,000 in addition to the payments previously made as reported by Mr. Brydges in 1877.\nNow, it is to be observed that the contractor could substantiate no claim whatever for any extras, nor for any alterations by way of addition to the work as described in the contract, except under the provisions of the above fourth paragraph, which required that an estimate should be made of the value of any alteration which caused a diminution of the work as contracted for, and that the amount thereof should be deducted from the value of any increase or addition in order to arrive at the final amount payable under the contract. No calculation of such a nature was ever made by Mr. Shanly. On the contrary, he suggested that, for reasons stated in his report, \"the deductions and additions provided for by the contract should be waived,\" and in accordance with this suggestion he makes a recommendation that sums of money, named in his report, should be paid to the contractor, composed partly of items claimed by the contractor for increased work under paragraph four, without any calculation of, and deduction for, diminution of work caused by alterations as provided by that paragraph, and partly of items which Mr. Shanly pronounces to be for work which he calls extra to and outside of the contract, although the contract expressly provides that no extra whatever shall be charged or claimed for otherwise than under the provisions of the said paragraph four, and he explains why he makes this recommendation in the following paragraph at the close of his report:\u2014\nOn the general principles and interpretation of the contract Mr. C. J. Brydges was examined by the Crown. He referred chiefly to a report made by him on this case in June, 1877, in reply to the petition of right, recommending that the strict letter of the contract be adhered to; this doubtless is perfectly correct in law, but I cannot help thinking that the present is a class of cases where a little equity may very properly be introduced.\nIn this report, which has never been adopted or approved by the Government or by the Minister of Railways, assuming him to be competent by his approval of such a report to give it any binding effect under the contract, Mr. Shanly very clearly shows that he never contemplated giving, and never did give, the contractor any certificate for the purpose of entitling him to recover from the Government any sum of money as remaining due to him under the terms of his contract, but that his report was simply a recommendation or suggestion to the Government that they should for the reasons stated by him, waive the contract altogether, and pay the contractor the sum named by Mr. Shanly in his report, not as being found to be due to the contractor under his contract, but as an act of grace and favor on the part of the Government.\nSuch a report, it is obvious, cannot be construed to be a certificate of the Chief Engineer which does or can entitle the contractor to recover any sum as remaining due and payable to him under the terms of his contract, nor can any legal claim whatever against the Government be founded thereon.\nThe respondent's claim, therefore, as asserted in his Petition of Right, which is and only could be founded upon the terms of his contract, wholly fails.\nThe appeal, therefore, must be allowed and with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014I think Mr. Shanly was Chief Engineer of the Intercolonial Railway for the purposes of the contract, He came literally within the terms of the statute, 31 Vic. ch. 13, s. 4, and I see no reason, in the lapse of time between the completion of the contract work and his appointment, or in the fact that he had not personal cognizance of the work during its progress, for reading any qualification into the language of the statute or of the order-in-council of the 23rd of June, 1880, by which he was appointed Chief Engineer of the Intercolonial Railway.\nThe same objections might have been taken in case the Chief Engineer who had held that office during the whole progress of the works had died immediately after their completion without having certified that they had been completed to his satisfaction, and Mr. Shanly had been at once appointed.\nI do not think it was necessary in order to entitle the contractor to payment of the amount of the final certificate that the certificate should have the approval of the Minister of Public Works or of the Minister of Railways and Canals. If I should attempt, as we have been invited to do by counsel on both sides, to form a judgment as to the importance of that certificate, either absolutely or more particularly in comparison with the progress certificates, I should undertake a task for which I confess my incompetence. I can only construe to the best of my ability the contract and the statutes.\nThe terms of the 11th section of the contract require the approval of the commissioners to the engineer's certificate for payment of the progress estimates, and entitle the contractor to payment of the final estimate, with the 15 per cent. retained from the progress estimates, on the certificate of the engineer, as doubtless the engineer's certificate is meant when it is said, \"on the completion of the whole work to the satisfaction of the engineer a certificate to that effect will be given,\" nothing being said of the commissioners.\nThe need for the approval by the commissioners depends on the Intercolonial Railway Act, 31 Vic. ch. 13, s. 18, which enacts that\nNo money shall be paid to any contractor until the Chief Engineer shall have certified that the work for or on account of which the same shall be claimed has been duly executed nor until such certificate shall have been approved of by the commissioners.\nMy brother Fournier has given, in his judgment in the Exchequer Court, his reasons for holding that section 18 ought not to be read as affecting this contract, at all events, so far as to require the commissioners to approve of the engineer's final certificate as an essential to the contractor's right to payment. I do not think he goes so far as to consider that the engineer's certificate is not essential though it is not declared in direct and express terms to be essential in section 11 of the contract. Those express terms are only found in section 18 of the statute.\nI appreciate the force of my learned brother's reasoning while I am not able entirely to adopt it. I think section 18 must be read as governing all payments to contractors for work in the construction of the Intercolonial Railway. It would probably have applied to money payable on progress certificates as well as on final certificates, but, inasmuch as its language is better fitted to final certificates, speaking of the work for or on account of which the money is claimed having been duly executed, it was prudent in drafting the contract to make it clear that the progress estimates were not to be paid unless the engineer's certificate was approved of by the commissioners, and I should not infer from that that the commissioners intended when they made the contract, or deemed they had power, to dispense with their approval of the final certificate.\nBut on the 25th of May, 1874, the Act 37 Vic. ch. 15 was passed. It repealed the third section of the Intercolonial Railway act which had declared that the construction of the railway and its management until completed should be under the charge of four commissioners, with so much of any other part of the act as authorised the appointment of any commissioner or commissioners for the construction and management of the railway, or the continuance of any such commissioner in office, or as might be in any way inconsistent with that act. Therefore when the work was finished, in December 1875, it had become impossible to procure the approval by the commissioners of the engineer's final certificate. If the act of 1874 had gone no further the necessity for any certificate except that of the engineer could not have been asserted. But the act went on to constitute the Intercolonial Railway a public work, vested in Her Majesty, and under the control and management; of the Minister of Public Works, and to transfer to and vest in the Minister all the powers and duties assigned by the former act to the commissioners. Did this act substitute the Minister for the Commissioners for all purposes in relation to this contract? I think not.\nTo make the Minister's approval of the engineer's certificate a condition precedent to the right of this contractor to demand his money would be to vary the contract. The contractor could properly say non h\u00e6c in f\u00e6dera veni, and it will not be assumed that the legislature intended to add a term to an existing contract without a plain legislative declaration to that effect. There is nothing in this statute of 1874 to indicate such an intention. On the contrary it can much more reasonably be held to be the intention that the provisions of section 16 of the Public Works act, 31 Vic., ch. 12, should afford a sufficient check upon the payment of money on account of the railway as well as on account of other public works. Why should two systems be looked for in the same department? Section 16 provides that no warrant is to be issued for any sum of the public money appropriated for any public work under the management of the Minister, except on the certificate of the Minister or his deputy that such sum ought to be paid to any person named in the certificate in whose favor a warrant may then issue.\nThis enactment seems to be in the nature of a departmental administrative regulation which does not touch the legal existence or validity of any claim or the claimant's right to be paid. It may not be beyond question that section 18 of the Intercolonial Railway Act, properly construed, was anything more, though, referring as it did to the engineer as well as to the commissioners, while the contract in its turn is expressed to be in all respects subject to the provisions of the act, the argument for reading the section into the contract appears to me insuperable.\nI agree with my brother Fournier, though I may not reach the conclusion by precisely the same process of reasoning, that the contractor is entitled to be paid on the final certificate of the Chief Engineer without approval of the certificate by the Minister.\nThe remaining question is whether he has a sufficient certificate.\nThe certificate is to be to the effect that the whole work has been completed to the satisfaction of the engineer. That is the provision of the 11th clause of the contract, and it is merely repeated without addition by the words of the 18th section of the statute, \"duly executed\" meaning executed according to the contract, or to the satisfaction of the engineer.\nI hold without hesitation that Mr. Shanly's report involves in it, and is, a certificate to the effect that the whole work has been completed to his satisfaction.\nBy the whole work I do not understand that specified in the contract without omissions or diminution. I mean all that by the contract the contractor undertook to do, which was the specified work varied as it might be under the 4th clause of the contract which provided as follows:\u2014\n4. The engineer shall be at liberty at any time before the commencement, or during the construction of any portion of the work, to make any changes or alterations which he may deem expedient in the grades, the line of location of the railway, the width of cuttings or fillings, the dimensions or character of structures, or in any other thing connected with the works, whether or not such changes increase or diminish the work to be done, or the expense of doing the same, and the contractor shall not be entitled to any allowance by reason of such changes, unless such changes consist in alterations in the grades of the line of location, in which case the contractor shall be subject to such deductions for such diminution of work, or entitled to such allowance for increased work (as the case may be) as the commissioners may deem reasonable, their decision being final in the matter. But while the certificate thus satisfies the terms of the contract what does it entitle the contractor to receive? The contract price and the allowances in respect of alterations of grade are not left to the arbitrament of the engineer. His final certificate, whether we look at the 11th clause of the contract or the 18th section of the statute, deals solely with the execution of the work. He does not settle the price to be paid.\nMr. Shanly's report relates principally, and as far as fixing prices is concerned may be said to relate altogether, to extra work and materials outside the contract. I do not know that any of the extra cost arose from alteration in the grades of the line, but if it di the commissioners and not the engineer were charged with the duty of settling the allowance for it.\nThis aspect of the question does not appear, as I gather from perusing the judgment delivered in the Exchequer Court, to have been pressed there, and I do not think it was made prominent on the argument before us. But it cannot be overlooked when we are asked to say if the suppliant is entitled to recover on Mr. Shanly's certificate or report, which is the question submitted to us.\nI believe, as I think I have shown, that on the other points discussed I substantially agree with my learned brother, but the question submitted should, in my opinion, for the reason last given, be answered for the crown, and I therefore think we should allow the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: O'Connor & Hogg.\nSolicitor for respondent: A.

RITCHIE C.J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for the Province of Quebec (appeal side) dated the 8th of October, 1890, quashing a writ of error to try the validity of a verdict for murder given against the plaintiff in error, Jean Baptiste Hermenegilde Morin, at the session of the Court of Queen's Bench (crown side) held at Mont magny, in the district of Montmagny, on the 26th day of March, 1890, and subsequent days.\nThe ground upon which the appeal to this court is based is thus stated in the assignment of errors, being in effect the same statement of it as that contained in the record as returned to the writ of error:\n\u201cThat at the time of the last criminal assizes at the district of Montmagny commenced on the 26th of March last the said Jean Baptiste Hermenegilde Morin was accused of the murder of one Fabien Roy in virtue of an indictment presented by the grand jury of the said district;\"\n\" That the said Morin pleaded not guilty to the said indictment, and, after trial had before a jury, was found guilty of the said charge of murder and was condemned by virtue of the sentence of the said court passed on the first of April last to be hanged on the 16th May instant \" \" That the said verdict, the said sentence, the proceedings at the said trial, the proof made in connection therewith, the swearing and the choosing of jurors, the orders judgments and action of the said court of Queen's Bench for Montmagny are illegal, null and of no effect, and tainted with legal error, the whole as is hereinafter shown :\"\n\u201cBecause at the time of the swearing of the jurors and the calling of their names according to the panel the crown, by its representative, caused to stand aside the greater part of the jurors called, and thus caused to stand aside, among others, Louis S\u00e9n\u00e9chal, Joseph Pouliot, Fran\u00e7ois V\u00e9zina, Augustin V\u00e9zina, Fran\u00e7ois Pouliot, Louis Collier, Salomon Brochu, Joseph La brecque, Evariste Leclerc, Joseph Caron, Adolphe Leclerc and Edmond Duquet, all jurors duly qualified :\"\n\u201cBecause all the said panel of jurors had been gone through and called even to and inclusive of the last name thereon:\"\n\" Because the clerk of the crown recommenced to call the names of the jurors on the said panel who had not been sworn, and called anew the person named Louis S\u00e9n\u00e9chal who had been caused to stand aside by the crown at the time of the first calling of his name :\"\n\" Because the crown, by its representative, wished airain to cause to stand aside the said Louis S\u00e9n\u00e9chal but the said accused by his advocate objected thereto and contended that the crown could not cause to stand aside and challenge the said S\u00e9n\u00e9chal except for cause:\" Because, contrary to law the court dismissed the objection of the said accused and permitted the crown to cause the said S\u00e9n\u00e9chal to stand aside without giving and showing cause :\"\n\" That the said causing to stand aside of the said S\u00e9n\u00e9chal, and the said decision are illegal and tainted with error :\" \" That the said causing to stand aside of the said S\u00e9n\u00e9chal, objections and decisions were put in writing and made part of the record in said cause :\"\n''That the same proceedings, objections, decisions and recording thereof were made as to the jurors fol lowing .Joseph Pouliot, Fran\u00e7ois V\u00e9zina, Augustin V\u00e9zina, Fran\u00e7ois Pouliot, Louis Collier, Salomon Bro chu, Joseph Labrecque, Evariste Leclerc, Joseph Caron, Adolphe Leclerc and Edmond Duquet.\"\nThe assignment of errors was endorsed as follows:\n\" Original assignment of errors filed this 1st October, 1890. Assignment of errors had and replied to instanter and hearing ordered Saturday next.\"\n\" Writ quashed. Tessier J. dissentiente.\"\nThe questions which arise in this case turn on the true construction of sections 259, 164 and 266, R.S.C. c. 174 which enact\nSec.259. Every court before which any person is convicted on indictment of any treason, felony or misdemeanor, and every judge within the meaning of \" The Speedy Trials Act,\" trying any person under such Act may, in its or his discretion, reserve any question of law which arises on the trial, for the consideration of the justices of the court for Crown cases reserved, and thereupon may respite execution of the judgment on such conviction, or postpone the judgment until such question has been considered and decided.\nSec.164. In all criminal trials four jurors may be peremptorily challenged on the part of the Crown but this shall not be construed to affect the right of the Crown to cause any juror to stand aside until the panel has been gone through, or to challenge any number of jurors for cause.\nSec 266 No writ of error shall be allowed in any criminal case unless it is founded on some question of law which could not have been reserved, or which the judge presiding at the trial refused to reserve for the consideration of the court having jurisdiction in such cases.\nIt is very obvious that while by section 259 of the Procedure Act c. 174, a judge may reserve any question of law which arises on the trial there may be, under section 266, questions of law which could not be reserved, that is, questions not arising on the trial for which a \"writ of error may lie. The first question to be determined then is Was this a question arising on the trial l To determine this we must ascertain when the trial begins. To do this it will be necessary to examine the mode of procedure in criminal cases.\nMr. Archbold in his work on pleading and evidence in criminal cases says as to the arraignment ([1]) :\u2014\nArraignment.\u2014The arraignment of prisoners, against whom true bills for indictable offences have been found by the grand jury consists of three parts : First, calling the prisoner to the bar by name; secondly, reading the indictment to him; thirdly, asking him whether he be guilty or not of the offence charged. It was formerly the practice to require the prisoner to hold up his hand, the more completely to identify him as the person named in the indictment, but the ceremony, which was never essentially necessary, is now disused; and the ancient form of asking him how he will be tried is also obsolete\n* * * *\nChallenge of Jurors ([2]).\u2014When a sufficient number of prisoners have pleaded and put themselves upon the country, the clerk of the arraigns addresses the prisoners thus: \"Prisoners, these good men that you shall now hear called are the jurors who are to pass between our sovereign lady the Queen and you upon your respective trials; (01 in a capital case, upon your life and death); if, therefore, you or any of you will challenge them or any of them you must challenge them as they come to the book to be sworn and before they are sworn, and you shall be heard. The officer then proceeds to call twelve jurors from the panel, calling each juror by name and address. Hereupon, and after a full jury has appeared (R. v. Edmonds, 4 B. & Al. 471) the proper time occurs for the defendant to exercise his right of challenge, or exception to the jurors returned to pass upon his trial.\n* * * *\nThe usual, and in general the proper course where the panel is exhausted by the challenges of the prisoner and the crown or of either before a full jury remains is to call over the whole panel again in the same order as before, but omitting those peremptorily challenged by the prisoner; and then, as each juror again appears whichever party challenges must show cause. If no sufficient cause of challenge be shown the jurors are then sworn. R. v. Geach C. & P. 499.\nThen comes the giving the prisoner in charge to the jury, as to which Mr. Archbold says at the next page :\nGiving the prisoner in charge of the jury.\u2014In cases of treason and felony the crier (at the assises) makes proclamation in the following form : \" If any one can inform my Lords the Queen's Justices, the Queen's Attorney General, or the Queen's Sergeant ere this inquest taken\" [this is in my opinion before it is taken] between our Sovereign Lady the Queen and the prisoners at the bar of any treason, murder, felony or misdemeanor committed or done by them or any of them, let him come forth and he shall ho heard; for the prisoners stand at the bar upon their deliverance. Cro. Cir. Com. 6 (10th ed.); 2 B. & Ad. 256.\nWhen this proclamation has been read Mr. Chitty in his work on Criminal Law ([3]). says :\nThe trial commences in the manner we shall presently consider.\nAnd in the next chapter 14, he treats of the trial evidence and verdict and says :.\nThe jury having been thus assembled in the jury box and sworn the clerk bids the prisoner hold up his hand for purposes of identification this is not now used) and addressing the \"jury says : \"Look upon the prisoner, you that are sworn and hearken to his cause.\"\nHe then describes the proceedings on jury trials much as Mr Archbold does which commences by giving the prisoner in charge to the jury thus :\nThe clerk of arraigns then calls the prisoners to the bar and says :\u2014 Gentlemen of the jury, the prisoner stands indicted by the name of A. B. for that he on the &c., (as in the indictment to the end). Upon this indictment he has been arraigned and upon his arraignment he has pleaded that he is not guilty.\nMr. Chitty adds :\n\" And for his trial bath put himself upon God and the country which country you are. Your charge, therefore, is to inq uire whether he be guilty or not guilty and to hearken to the evidence.\nMr. Chitty adds : When the prisoner is given in charge to the jury the counsel for the prosecution or if there be more than one the senior counsel opens the case to the jury stating the legal facts upon which the prosecution relied.\nThen, and not till then, does the trial, in my opinion, commence.\nLord Campbell in Mansell v. The Queen ([4]) says;\nAfter prisoners have had their challenges, the oath of the juryman is : \" You shall well and truly try and a true deliverance make, between our sovereign lady the Queen, and the several prisoners you shall have in charge.\" When the prisoner is given in charge to the jury, by that jury he must be tried, and in felony or treason the jury cannot separate till they have found their verdict.' But (as often happens at the assizes) before a particular prisoner who has had his challenges is given in charge to the jury, the court rises and the jury separate. Next morning a new jury is called when the prisoner again has his challenges; and possibly there may not be one individual upon the second jury that was sworn on the first \u25a0 yet all this is regular.\nIn Regina v Faderman ([5]) the counsel for the prisoner says '.\u2014\nBy statute 11 & 12 Vic. c. 78 sec. 1 any question of law may be reserved for this court which shall have arisen on the trial The trial commences as soon as the prisoner is called on to plead.\nParke B. says :\u2014\nProperly there is no trial until the issue is joined. This I take to mean until the prisoner is given in charge to the jury.\nAlderson B. says :\u2014\nYou say the trial begins with the arraignment; how then do you explain the question which is put to the prisoner after arraignment : How will you be tried ? At what point in the proceedings did the trial by battle begin? Trial is a very technical word.\nThis being so I think we are, in a case such as this, not to enlarge its signification and treat it in a popular or general sense, but to give the term a strict construction\nIt is clear that if the question did arise on the trial, we have no jurisdiction to hear it. In the following case where a party pleaded guilty it was held it could not be heard on a case reserved. The Queen v. Clark ([6]).\nThis case was considered by Cockburn C. J., Martin and Bramwell BB., and Mellor and Montague Smith JJ. No counsel appeared on either side.\nCockburn C. J. :\nIn this case we have no jurisdiction. It was not a question arising on the trial; for the man pleaded guilty, and he must be taken to know the law. The power to state a case for the consideration of this court only applies to questions of law which arise on the trial.\nI have been referred to the case of Regina v. Brown ([7]), where the prisoner was convicted upon his own confession. It is not stated in the case that the prisoner pleaded guilty, nor whether he had been given in charge to the jury and had on his trial confessed to offence. The court held that the point did arise on the trial It is difficult to see how if the prisoner pleaded guilty when arraigned, the case could be distinguished from Regina v. Clark (1) but the court thus distinguished it .*\n\"'We think therefore that this court has jurisdiction to entertain the case and we think it notwithstanding Regina v. Clark (1). It is to be observed that that case is not directly in point, because there the indictment was good, though the facts stated in the depositions did not support it. The prisoner having pleaded guilty to the indictment the court thought that the point did not arise at the trial. The distinction in the present case is that the objection was not as to the sufficiency of proof, but arose upon the indictment itself. It was an objection which might have been taken without the proof being gone into We should not have shrunk from differing from the decision in Regina v. Clark (1) if that case had been directly in point. It is not and therefore we do not actually differ from it.\nWe are of opinion 1st\u2014That we have jurisdiction to entertain this case, and 2ndly\u2014that upon the facts and clearly upon the general law, the boy was properly convicted upon his own confession of an attempt to commit an unnatural offence.\nIt is to be remarked that this case was decided with- out the court having the assistance of counsel, and that the case of Regina v. Faderman ([8]) was not cited or referred to in which Lord Campbell thus speaks :\nWe all think that this court has no jurisdiction to entertain tins question. We are asked to review a judgment for the crown given on demurrer and to reverse it if we think it wrong. The only power we have is derived from the statute 11\u201412 Vic. ch. 78. That act gives us no such power the word \" convicted \" there used means convicted by a verdict. Trial means trial before a jury. \"We have no power in case of a judgment on demurrer. It would be dangerous if We had for as it is clear that no writ of error lies from our judgment we should by hearing this case be depriving the prisoner of a right which he would otherwise be entitled to.\nUntil a full jury is sworn there can be no trial, because until that is done there is no tribunal competent to try the prisoner. The terms of the jurymen's oath seem to show this. And as is to be inferred as we have even from what Lord Campbell says that all that takes place anterior to the completion and swearing of the jury is preliminary to the trial.\nHow can the prisoner be tried until there is a court competent to try him? And how can there be a court until there is a judge on the bench and a jury in the box duly sworn? Until there is a court thus constituted there can be no trial because there is no tribunal competent to try him. But when there is a court duly constituted the prisoner being present and given in charge to the jury his trial in my opinion commences, and not before. The trial mentioned in the statute is clearly a trial of the prisoner by the jury, as we have seen it held in Regina v. Faderman (1). No prisoner can be tried except by a jury duly selected and sworn to try him but there may be questions preliminary to the obtaining a competent jury to which the right to reserve a case cannot, in my opinion, apply. Thus if after a full jury appears and the array is challenged this is tried by the court. In Bacon's Abridgement ([9]) it is said :\u2014\nEvery question of law raised upon a challenge to the array of the jury is to be tried by the court upon an examination of witnesses; for J unless every such question, although it depend upon a matter of fact, be so tried, there would be a delay of justice.\nIt is said that in Regina v. Manning ([10]), where the prisoner's wife applied for a jury de m\u00e9dit\u00e2tes lingue which was rejected on the ground that she was naturalized, the array was challenged, but in that case the array does not appear to have been challenged for the court held the trial must proceed. Mr. Ballantine moved that his application might be entered on the record, the attorney general said that if that were done he would plead that the female prisoner had married said Edward Manning a natural born subject of the realm. After some consultation it was agreed that Mr. Ballantyne should have the option of raising the question on the record or of having the point reserved for the consideration of the Court of Appeal in criminal cases.\nSo in a case of a challenge to the polls, Mr. Archbold in his pleading and evidence m criminal cases saps ([11]) '.\nIn the case of a principal challenge to thepolis,if the partiality be made apparent to the satisfaction of the court, the challenge is at once allowed, and the juror set aside. But in the case of a challenge to the favor it is left to the discretion of two triers who are sworn and charged to try whether the juror challenged stands indifferent between the parties. The form of oath to a trier, to try whether a juror stands indifferent or not is as follows '.\n\u201cYou shall well and truly try whether A.B., one of the jurors, stands indifferently to try the prisoner at the bar, and a true verdict give according to the evidence. So help you God.\"\nIt may be observed, that no challenge of triers is admissible. The form of oath to be administered to a witness sworn to give evidence before the triers is as follows :\n\"The evidence which you shall give to the court and triers upon this inquest shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth So help you God.\"\nIf the challenge is to the first juror called, the court may select any two indifferent persons as triers; if they find against the challenge, the juror will be sworn, and be joined with the triers in determining the next challenge; but as soon as two jurors have been found indifferent, and have been sworn, every subsequent challenge will be referred to their decision 2 Hale 275; Co Litt 158 a; Bac. Abr., Juries (E) 12. The trial thus directed proceeds by witnesses called to support or defeat the challenge.\nAfter the decision I have quoted nobody would, I should think, pretend to say that either of these trials was the trial contemplated by the statute as to which any case could be reserved, showing very clearly, I think, that the trial contemplated was, as I have said a trial by a jury after it was completed, and if no case can be reserved upon such trials of challenges does it not follow that a case cannot be reserved when the judge rules that the crown was not obliged to challenge for cause, assuming the law requires the crown to do so ? Why should a case be reserved to compel the crown to make a good challenge by assigning cause when if the crown has assigned cause and its sufficiency was referred to tiers a question arising on such a trial could not be reserved?\nIn The Queen v. Lamb ([12]) after the prisoner had been given in charge and before any witness was sworn it appeared that the prosecutrix, a child of four years of age did not sufficiently understand the nature of an oath, and it was admitted on the part of the crown that there was no other evidence to sustain the case On the part of the prisoner it was insisted that having been given in charge to the jury he was entitled to his acquittal. The judge discharged the jury obliging the prisoner to enter into a recognizance with sufficient sureties for his appearance at the next court. A case was submitted to the twelve judges to ascertain whether in their opinion, the prisoner was entitled \u00b0 to his acquittal or whether the court was justified, under the circumstances, in discharging the jury, and authorized to bind over the prisoner to appear and take his trial at the next court. The judges unanimously gave their opinion that the prisoner ought to have been acquitted and that he should be recommended for a pardon.\nAnd the case of REGINA V. WADE ([13]) is to the same effect.\nWhy was this ? Because, having been given in charge to the jury, no legal cause having been alleged or question shown for discharging the jury, the prisoner then being on his trial he must be either convicted or acquitted. As no evidence was offered he was on that trial therefore entitled to his acquittal, as he would have been if the evidence offered had been insufficient; but it is very different when a full jury to try the prisoner cannot be obtained, though some jurors have been sworn, but not sufficient to make a full jury and the jury has to be discharged for default of jurors * but where all were sworn and a good cause shown for discharging them, as the illness of a juryman, etc., a new jury may be impanelled, and the prisoner will be entitled to challenge as in the first instance showing very clearly the difference where the prisoner has been given in charge and no cause shown for the discharge of the jury. In the first case the prisoner was in jeopardy, in the second he never was and in the third case he ceased to be when the jury were legally discharged. But is it not equally clear that if the alleged trial was not a legal trial but a mistrial, and therefore a nullity, if reversed he can again be tried because he never was in jeopardy ? It is a fundamental principle of law that a man shall not he twice in jeopardy for the same offence, that is, no prisoners shall be prosecuted twice for the same offence., I think the fair test of when the trial begins is : When was the prisoner put in jeopardy ? It is to my mind very clear that no jeopardy can attach until a full jury is impannelled, sworn on a plea of not guilty and the prisoner given in charge to such jury because there can be no trial until there is a jury competent to try. Mr. Bishop, in his work on Criminal Law states the law as recognised in the United States very clearly, and which in my opinion is equally applicable to this Dominion. He says ([14]):\u2014\nWhen jeopardy begins. Then on the completing and swearing of the panel the jeopardy of the accused begins and it begins only when the panel is full. Until full the jeopardy is not perfect. In order words, . without a jury set apart and sworn for the particular case the individual defendant has not been conducted to his period of jeopardy. But when, according to the better opinion, the jury being full is sworn, and added to the other branch of the court and all the preliminary things of record are ready for the trial the prisoner has reached the jeopardy from the repetition of which our constitutional rule protects him.citing in support of this very many American authorities.\nIf, then, this question arose while the preliminary proceedings were in progress and before the trial commenced it could not therefore be reserved. Then the next question that arises is : Was it a proper case for a wr it of error ? I think it most clearly was. The sections of ch. 174 applicable to this I have read. Assuming that this is not a legal trial and no question could be reserved for the reasons stated and the prisoner is deprived of his writ of error, how can he possibly avail himself of his right to show the validity of his objection ? I am aware that doubts have been expressed by learned judges in England as to a writ of error being proper in such a case as this, but I understand their doubts have been suggested because in England the question of the right of a party to insist that there should be only a challenge for cause after the panel has been gone through has been considered rather a matter of practice than of law but in this Dominion it is matter of law and in this case appears on the face of the record; it is a right secured to the prisoner under the statute I have referred to. The practice in England has been by statute recognised to be the law of this Dominion and as to any error of law appearing on the face of the record the remedy by writ of error if applicable. In Short and Mellor's Practice of the Crown Office ([15]) as to error it is said :\u2014\nIt is a characteristic feature in English criminal procedure that it admits of no appeal properly so called either upon matters of fact or upon matters of law. though there are a certain number of proceedings which to some extent appear to be, and to some extent are, exceptions to this rule\nThe first of these exceptions is a writ of error. It is a remedy applicable to those cases only in which some irregularity apparent upon the record of the proceedings takes place in the procedure.\nIn Regina v. Frost ([16]), Sir J.Campbell A. G. says :\nIt may le allowed that, in considering this and all other statutes, the intention of the legislature was to be looked for; when that was discovered, courts were bound by it. Whatever form the legislature had clearly prescribed, must be observed; and it may be allowed that it is not for the judges, if that form has been clearly and distinctly prescribed to consider whether it was or not advantageous to the prisoner. The doctrine of equivalents and equipollents must be discharged. Whatever the prisoner was entitled to by acts of parliament, that specific thing he had a right to demand; and it would be vain to say that something, even more for his advantage, had been conferred. But in ascertaining the meaning of the legislature, it might be most material to see what was the object and how that obiect could best be accomplished.\nI think we should be most careful not to deprive a prisoner of his writ of error unless we are satisfied. beyond all reasonable doubt that the statute has taken it away from him.\nThis brings us to the last and really the substantial matter of this case. The practice which I have said our Parliament by statute has recognised to be acted upon is that after giving the crown in all criminal trials four peremptory challenges it declares that this shall not be construed to affect the right of the crown to cause any juror to stand aside until the panel has been gone through or to challenge any number of jurors for cause. If we look at the practice in England, as to the effect of desiring jurors to stand aside, or that in the provinces previous to the passing of this statute, so far as my experience extends and as I can discover, the practice has been entirely consistent, namely, that the panel shall be gone through, or perused as it is termed, once on which calling or perusal it was the privilege of the crown to require jurors to stand aside until the list shall be gone through. Having been gone through and a jury not secured the clerk proceeds to go over the panel a second time when the right of the crown to require jurors to stand aside ceased, and the crown was bound, if its officers sought to perfect its challenge, to do so by showing some good and sufficient cause or to challenge peremptorily if the peremptory challenges were not exhausted. This practice, in my opinion, as I have said, is recognised and consecrated by the statute I have referred to. I cannot discover on the part of Parliament any intention to alter the law and practice and establish a different mode of procedure. It is abundantly clear that in this case the panel had been gone through and was exhausted and a full jury could not be obtained without those who had been asked to stand aside by the crown being again called. Then the period had arrived at which the crown was bound to assign cause and instead of being compelled to do so the crown was on the second perusal of the panel again allowed to cause jurors to \" stand aside without showing cause. In Regina v. cropper ([17]), the course of proceeding is very clearly pointed out, as follows :\nThe jury panel contained the names of forty-eight persons. On its being called over, seven were challenged by the prisoner and five by the crown. Only eight others of the forty-eight juryman were in attendance, besides those challenged, and those eight went into the box.\nThe panel had been entirely called through. The counsel for the prisoner then proposed that the panel should be again called, which was done, and on the first challenge on the part of the crown, the counsel for the prisoner called upon the counsel for the crown to assign cause of challenge. Cause was assigned, which appeared to the learned baron to be insufficient, and that juryman was sworn. The next juryman challenged on the part of the crown was sworn on the voir dire, and examined for cause, which cause was not allowed by the learned baron; he was then sworn. The challenges of the next two jurymen were given up by the counsel for the crown, and the jury were thus completed and sworn.\nThe jury were then charged with the prisoner on the before-mentioned indictment, and the case having been closed and summed up, the jury retired to consider their verdict.\nThe case of Mansell v. The Queen ([18]) has been much pressed upon us, but, so far from sustaining the action of the judge in this case, it is, in my opinion, quite the contrary. The question there was, not the necessity for the crown to show cause on the second perusal of the panel, but whether the panel had been gone through without calling the jurors who were out on another trial, and who came in after the names of the jurors in court had been called, and the court held that they were properly called because the panel had not been exhausted although once called over. Cockburn, C.J. says in this case, page 104:\nIt appears that before 4 stat. 33 Ed. 1, the crown, either by prerogativc or by usurpation exercised the power of peremptory challenge without restriction as to number; and if that power was exercised so that twelve jurors did not remain, the inquest went off for that cause. To meet this evil the act was passed. On the enactment a practice was grafted by which, on the counsel for the crown intimating his intention to challenge one of the jurors, he was not put to assign cause at once, but the juror was set aside until the panel was gone through to ascertain if enough of persons not objected to might not be found to make a jury, If the panel was large this, in effect, was equivalent to a peremptory challenge. In one of the early state trials, Firzharris's case ([19]) the Chief Justice uses language as if in practice at that time this privilege was not confined to the crown, but that either side might set aside the juror and afterwards take their exceptions. But, be that as it may, it must he admitted by everyone that it is now settled by overwhelming authority that where it is proposed to object to a juror, the counsel for the crown have the right to have the man set aside until it is seen if without him there will be jurors enough to try the prisoner, and that it is not until the panel is gone through that cause need be shown. That being so, the question is reduced to this : When is the panel gone through ? Is it as soon as the names have been called over ? Or is it not until every proper attempt has been made to secure the presence of those on the panel whose duty it is to attend ? In the present case the panel had been called over, properly omitting the names of twelve who were known to be justifiably absent, the calling of whose names would have been an idle ceremony, and enough persons did not remain to form a jury. Iremonger's name is again called; and before anything more is done the twelve absent jurymen come in. It is not disputed that they were duly qualified jurymen and on the list; but it is contended that the list having been once gone through, it must be gone through again in the same order as before But it being conceded that the crown is not put to show cause for its challenge till the panel is gone through, it seems to me very clear that the panel was not gone through till those twelve names of available jurymen were called.\nThe learned Chief Justice then discusses the case of lremo\u00e6ger which is not applicable to this case.\nThe meaning of standing aside being a challenge by the crown, the consideration of the challenge should not proceed until it could be seen whether a full jury Can be got without there being others on the panel. in this Dominion it is not now matter of practice or indulgence or concession, but as I have said a right re cognised by statute, a right of which no court, in my opinion, can deprive a prisoner. In this case I think there was a distinct abridgement of the rights of the prisoner. If the crown can order a juror to stand aside on a second perusal of the panel, why may they not do it a third or a fourth time, it fact indefinitely until a jury was selected to suit the prosecuting officer, a case similar to what was pointed out by Lord Campbell in the Mansell case as follows ([20]) :\u2014\nOur judgment chiefly depends upon the right construction of the ancient statute 4 stat. 33 Ed. 1 entitled \" An ordinance for Inquests, \" which was re-enacted by 6 G. 4 c. 50 s. 29. An abuse had arisen in the administration of justice by the crown assuming an unlimited right of challenging jurors without assigning cause, whereby inquests remained \" untaken.\" In this way the crown could in an arbitrary manner, on every criminal trial, challenge so many of the jurors returned on the panel by the sheriff that twelve did not remain to make a jury; and the trial might be indefinitely postponed pro defectu juratorum, to the great oppression of the subject, and contravention of the words of Magna Charta ([21]). Nulli differemus rectum vel justitiam. The remedy was to give to the party accused a right to be tried by the jurors summoned upon his arraignment, if after the limited num ber of challenges to which he was entitled without cause assigned,there remained twelve iurors of those returned upon the panel to whose qualification and unindifferency no specific objection to be proved by legal evidence could be made. To prevent the trial going off for want of jurors by the peremptory challenges of the crown it is enacted that \"they that sue for the King,\" \"shall assign of their challenge a cause certain and the truth of the same challenge shall be inquired of a cord ing to the custom of the court.\" 33rd there was no intention of tak ing away all power of peremptory challenge from the crown, while that power to the number of thirty-five, was left to the prisoner. Indeed, unless this power were given under certain restrictions to both sides it is quite obvious that justice could not be satisfactorily admin- istered; for it must often happen that a juror is returned on the panel who does not stand indifferent, and who is not fit to serve upon the trial, although no legal evidence could be adduced to prove his unfitness. The object of the statute is fully attained if the crown be prevented from exercising its rower of peremptory challenge, so as to make the trial go off while there are twelve of those returned upon the panel who cannot be proved to be liable to a valid objection. Accord ingly the course has invariably been, from the passing of the statute to the present time, to permit the crown to challenge without cause till the panel had been called over and exhausted and then to call over the names of the jurors peremptorily challenged by the crown and to put the crown to assign cause, so that, if twelve of those upon the panel remain as to whom no just cause of objection can be assigned, the trial may proceed. In our books of authority, the rule is laid down that the King need not show any cause of his challenge till the whole panel be gone through, and it appear that there will not be a full jury without the person so challenged.\nWilles J. in Exchequer Court ([22]), citing 4 Blackstone Com. 353,\nThe king need not assign his cause of challenge until all the panel is gone through, and unless there cannot be a full jury without the person so challenged, and then, and not sooner, the king's counsel must show the cause or otherwise the juror shall be sworn.\nI think, therefore, in this case there was an assumption on the part of the officer of an unlimited right of challenging jurors without assigning cause. The object of the law certainly is to secure the prisoners a fair trial How can this be accomplished if he is deprived of the privilege the law gives him in the selection of the jury by whom he is to be tried ?\nI take the liberty to adopt the language of Lord Campbell C. J. in Reg. v. Bird ([23]) where he says : \u2014\nI should feel deep regret if a great offender were to escape punishment, but the due administration of criminal justice requires that the forms of judicial procedure should be observed, these forms are devised for the detection of the guilty and for the protection of the innocent\nIn the present instance the objection taken is not raised on a mere technicality but is that the jury to whom the prisoner shall be given in charge shall be legally selected, chosen and sworn, and that neither the crown nor the prisoner shall have any advantage or privilege other than those conferred by law; but when privileges are conferred by law they shall be rigidly respected.\nBelieving then as I do, that the prisoner has not had a legal trial I cannot by my voice send him to the gal lows. Had I any doubt in the case I should in favorem vitce give the prisoner the benefit of such a doubt.\nSTRONG J. In the case of Brisebois v. The Queen ([24]) the meaning of section 259 of the Criminal Procedure Act ([25]), was under consideration, and I there had occasion to consider what constituted a question of law arising on the trial which could be reserved pursuant to the terms of that section. I was then of opinion that any matter or question of law which arose before the judge presiding at a criminal trial, though it might arise before the empanelling of the jury was complete, and therefore before the prisoner was given in charge, was a question of law susceptible of being reserved under the section in question, and the dissenting judgment which I then delivered was based on this view of the construction of the statute.\nThis opinion was founded upon the English authorities and also upon what I considered to be the mean ing properly to be attributed to the word \" trial l as used in this section 259. It appeared to me that this word was not to be restricted in its meaning to that portion of the proceedings which strictly and technically constitute the trial, namely, that part of the proceedings which does not begin until after the jury have been (to use a technical expression) \" selected tried and sworn, \" and which is initiated when the officer of the court (in the language of Sir James Stephen) ([26]) in cases of treason and felony gives the prisoner in charge to the Jury, stating the effect of the indictment or inquisition, and the prisoner's plea of not guilty and charging them to determine whether he is guilty or not. The opinion I formed in Brisebois' case was that a much larger and more liberal interpretation of the words \" which arises on the trial, should be adopted, and that what seemed to be the English practice should be followed, viz., that the word \" trial l was not to be confined to its strict technical signification but that as in England the statute should be interpreted as applying to all proceedings on or incidental to the trial, including the preliminaries of the trial as well as proceedings subsequent to the verdict. I confess, so far as my own individual opinion goes, I still remain of the same mind and if I was unfettered by authority, I should hold that the question of law involved in the challenges the allowance of which has been assigned as error in the present case, were questions which might have been reserved under section 259.\nI am not, however free to act on this opinion for the reason that a majority of the court in Brisebois' case according to my reading of the reported judgments then delivered, held otherwise. There the objection was that a juror whose name was oil the panel had been personated by a person whose name was not on the panel. This personation was not discovered until after a verdict of guilty had been found and recorded, when it was raised for the first time, whereupon the learned judge who presided at that trial reserved it and stated a case under the statute for the determination of the Court of Ardeal It was held that under these circumstances the question of law so reserved was not one arising on the trial and therefore was not properly a matter which could be reserved under sec. 259. I cannot regard this decision of the court otherwise than as overruling my own opinion expressed in Brisebois' case to the effect already stated. The judgment in the case referred to is therefore, I conceive, an authority binding me, irrespective of my own opinion to construe the word \" trial l strictly. It is true that there the objection was taken not as here before the trial commenced but after the verdict had been recorded and therefore after the trial had in strictness been concluded and it was therefore held to be too late to be reserved under the act But if we are to construe the word \" trial\" strictly as regards objections taken after its conclusion, we must also do the same as regards questions of law which arise before its commencement. Moreover the real objection in 'Brisebois' case, the real question of law which it was held could not have been there reserved, arose before the commencement of the trial though it was not discovered until afterwards.\nAs I am thus precluded by authority from following my own judgment as to what I consider to be the proper interpretation of sec. 259, I have no alternative but to abide by the only other construction possible, namely, that which has been stated by the Chief Justice in the judgment he has just delivered and which attributes to the word \"trial \" its strictly legal and technical meaning. I must therefore hold that the question raised by this writ of error was one which could not have been reserved at the trial It follows that the writ of error in the present case does not come within the prohibition contained in sec. 266.\nIt remains to be considered whether the decision of the learned judge at the trial in sustaining the objection of the counsel for the crown to eleven of the jurors who had on the first calling over of the panel been ordered by the crown to stand aside was erroneous in law. I am of opinion that this ruling, having regard to section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which limits the right of the crown to order jurors to stand aside only until the panel has been once gone through, was substantially an allow once of eleven peremptory challenges, and therefore the crown not having the right to challenge peremptorily that number of jurors, the objections to more than four of those jurors were unwarranted by law and consequently the court erred in allowing them. Upon the authorities and for the reasons already fully stated by the Chief Justice, and which I need not repeat, I am of opinion that the crown upon an indictment for felony is by the 164th sec. of the Procedure Act limited to the challenge of four jurors peremptorily and without cause, a number which was indisputably exceeded in the present case.\nThere being, therefore, upon the face of the record a judgment, not merely a ruling upon a point of practice within the discretion of the judge, but what is strictly a judgment which is manifestly erroneous as regards seven of the eleven jurors who were ordered to stand aside the second time, I hold that this is a proper subject for a writ of error. Upon this point again 1 am entirely of accord with the Chief Justice, and adopting the reasons he has given and relying on the authorities he has quoted my judgment must be for the prisoner. I may add that upon this last point 1 regard a passage in the judgment of Lord Tenterden, Chief Justice in the King v. Edmonds ([27]) as decisive. Lord Tenterden there says;\nIt must further be observed that the disallowing of a challenge is a ground not for a new trial, but for what is strictly and technically a venire de novo. The party complaining thereof applies to the court, not for the exercise of the sound and legal discretion of the judges, but for the benefit of an imperative rule of law, and the improper granting or the improper refusing of a challenge is alike the foundation of a writ of error.\nI am of Opinion, therefore, that there has been a mistrial and that the appeal must be allowed and a venire de novo awarded.\nFOURNIER J. Le jugement soumis \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision de cette cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc de la Reine, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, dans la cause de la Reine contre Herm\u00e9nigilde Morin, sur un bref d'erreur, pour faire d\u00e9clarer nul le verdict d\u00e9 meurtre, rendu contre le prisonnier dans le terme de mars de la Cour Criminelle, \u00e0 Montmagny.\nPlusieurs moyens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9s pour l'obtention de ce bref, mais il n'en a \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 qu'un seul devant cette cour. Il est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 comme suit \u00b0.\n\" Que lors de la formation du petit jury, les personnes suivantes, savoir : Louis S\u00e9n\u00e9chal, Joseph Pouliot, Fran\u00e7ois V\u00e9zina, Augustin V\u00e9zina, Fran\u00e7ois Pouliot, Eugene Hamond, Louis Colin, Salomon Brochu, Joseph Labrecque, Evariste Leclerc, Joseph Caron, Adoiphe Leclerc, Edmond Duquet et Alfred Fiset furent r\u00e9cus\u00e9s sans cause, par le couronne \"ordered to stand aside.\"\n\" Qu'apr\u00e8s que la liste des petits jur\u00e9s eut \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e une fois, vu qu'il manquait encore un jur\u00e9 pour former le petit jury, la couronne fit recommencer appel des \u00e6oms, et arriv\u00e9 aux noms des personnes susmentionn\u00e9s elle les r\u00e9cusa encore sans cause. L'accus\u00e9 alors objecta \u00e0 ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9, demandant que ha couronne fut tenue de montrer cause pour cette seconde r\u00e9cusation.\n\"Que l'Hon. Pr\u00e9sident du tribunal d\u00e9cida que la couronne n'\u00e9tait pas oblig\u00e9e de montrer cause, tel que cela appert par le record devant cette cour.\" Lorsque le second appel des jur\u00e9s a eu lieu l'avocat de l'accus\u00e9 a fait objection au droit r\u00e9clame par la couronne d'exercer une seconde fois la demande de \"stand aside \" et ii a Ct\u00e9 entr\u00e9 un jugement ainsi que le fait voir le dossier, rapport\u00e9 devant cette cour, d\u00e9clarant que le jur\u00e9 pouvait \u00eatre mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 une seconde fois sur la demande de la couronne. Ce proc\u00e9d\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 pour onze jur\u00e9s de suite qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 une seconde fois par la cour sur Ta demande de l'avocat de la couronne, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'on arriva au douzi\u00e8me. La m\u00e9me objection fut faite \u00e0 chaque jur\u00e9 et rejet\u00e9e a chaque fois par la cour.\nLa liste des jur\u00e9s avait \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e compl\u00e8tement une premi\u00e8re fois (gone through) lorsqu'elle le fut une sevconde fois et que la cour d\u00e9cida que la Couronne avait droit a un second stand aside. Cette d\u00e9cision est-elle l\u00e9gale ? C'est l'importante question que soul\u00e8ve le pr\u00e9sent appel.\nLa Cour du Banc de la Reine, appel\u00e9e \u00e0 se prononcer sur cette question, s'est abstenue de lajuger sur le principe qu'elle n'avait pas de juridiction et a renvoy\u00e9 le bref d'erreur en se basant sur la clause 266 du ch. 1T4 des statuts criminels. Cette clause se lit comme suit :\nNo writ of error shall be allowed in any criminal case unless it is founded on some questions of law which could not have been reserved or which the judge presiding at the trial refused to reserve for the consideration of the court having jurisdiction in such cases.\nMaintenant quel doit \u00eatre l'effet de cette disposition sur le bref d'erreur; est-elle une prohibition absolue de l'\u00e9mission de ce bref, \u00e0 moins qu'il y ait eu une question de droit que le juge pr\u00e9sidant au proc\u00e8s aurait refuse de r\u00e9server, ou encore, \u00e0 moins que comme il est dit dans la premi\u00e8re partie de la clause 266 que le bref ne soit fond\u00e9 sur quelque question qui n'aurait Pu \u00eatre r\u00e9serve. Cette premi\u00e8re partie de la section en question ne semble pas \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue offrir une significa- . tion bien facile \u00e0 saisir. On a dit qu'elle ne pourrait jam\u00e1is recevoir d'application par\u00e9e qu'il n'y a pas de question de droit soulev\u00e9e au proc\u00e8s que le juge pr\u00e9sidant ne puisse r\u00e9server. Cela est vrai dans un sens restreint, et pourvu que le juge en soit rendu au proc\u00e8s, ou trial\nC'est \u00e9videmment ce que comporte le texte de notre statut dans les deux seules sections o\u00f9 ii soit fait mention des questions r\u00e9serves. Par la section 266, pour qu'il y ait lieu au bref d'erreur, ii faut que le refus du juge de r\u00e9server une question de droit alt eu lieu at the trial La section 259 du m\u00eame acte dit que la cour ou le juge pr\u00e9sidant au proc\u00e8s peut r\u00e9server des questions de droit et s'exprime ainsi i\nMay in its or his discretion, reserve any question of law which arises on the trial for the consideration of the justices of the court for Crown cases reserved.\nLa section 266 me para\u00eet reconna\u00eetre deux cat\u00e9gories de cas o\u00f9 le bref d'erreur peut \u00eatre \u00e9mis; les premi\u00e8res, ceux o\u00f9 la question de droit n'a Pu \u00eatre r\u00e9serv\u00e9e; la seconde lorsque le juge pr\u00e9sidant au proc\u00e8s a refus\u00e9 de r\u00e9server la question. D'apr\u00e8s le texte ce n'est donc que lorsque le juge est an proc\u00e8s trial que son refus de r\u00e9server une question de droit peut donner lieu au bref d'erreur autrement ii n'en a pas le pouvoir.\nCette loi \u00e9tant d\u00e9nature \u00e0 restreindre les droits du sujet quant au bref d'erreur doit comme toutes les lois restrictives, \u00eatre strictement interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e. Le mot trial, dont se sert le statut doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme employ\u00e9 dans son sens l\u00e9gal et technique, et signifie cette partie du proc\u00e8s de l'accus\u00e9 qui commence apr\u00e8s l'assermentation du jury auquel ii a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 en charge, alors que commence l'examen des mati\u00e8res de faits in issue en contestation. Cette partie de l'instruction forme le proc\u00e8s trial par opposition aux proc\u00e9dures comme l'arraignment, l'appel des jur\u00e9s, les r\u00e9cusa- tions des jur\u00e9s et leur proc\u00e8s par des tiers, qui ne sont que des proc\u00e9dures pr\u00e9liminaires. Ces proc\u00e9dures ayant lieu avant que le \" trial\" ne soit commenc\u00e9, on, ne peut pas dire que les questions de droit qui pourraient s'\u00e9lever pendant ces proc\u00e9dures pr\u00e9liminaires puissent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme soul\u00e8ves au proc\u00e8s-trial.\nCe n'est que lorsque le juge en est rendu an trial que son refus de r\u00e9server une question doit \u00eatre constat\u00e9 et qu'il donne alors lieu \u00e0 la demande d'un bref d'erreur Cette section 266 consacre une division de la cause criminelle, qui d'ailleurs est reconnue par les auteurs, en deux parties bien distinctes. La premi\u00e8re qui consiste en des proc\u00e9dures pr\u00e9liminaires commence \u00e0 l'arraignment et finit \u00e0 l'assermentation du jury; la deuxi\u00e8me, le \" trial,\" qui commence \u00e0 l'assermentation du jury et finit \u00e0 la sentence. C'est pendant cette derni\u00e8re partie seulement que le refus du juge der\u00e9server une question de droit peut donner lieu \u00e0, l'\u00e9mission du bref d'erreur. Comme ii n'est nullement question dans la premi\u00e8re partie de la section 266, de l'intervention du juge, les questions de droit qui peuvent s'\u00e9l\u00e9ver alors au sujet des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s ne sont nullement affect\u00e9es par la disposition restrictive de cette section Celles qui peuvent s'\u00e9lever dans cette partie de la proc\u00e9dure restent soumises aux dispositions du droit an glais quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9mission du bref d'erreur, et il peut \u00eatre \u00e9mis ici de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re qu'il le serait en Angleterre, sur des questions de droit dans lesquelles il y aurait eu erreur suffisante. Le jugement qui fait la mati\u00e8re du bref d'erreur, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu lorsqu'on en n'\u00e9tait encore qu'\u00e0 l'appel des jur\u00e9s, ne pouvait pas \u00eatre r\u00e9serv\u00e9 parce qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu avant quo le proc\u00e8s trial ne f\u00fbt commenc\u00e9.\nPour \u00e9tablir la distinction que je fais entre le trial et les proc\u00e9dures pr\u00e9liminaires, je me base sur la haute autorit\u00e9 de Chitty's Criminal Law. Il d\u00e9crit ainsi le commencement du proc\u00e8s :\nThe .challenges being then completed and a full jury of unexception able jurors by some of the means we have examined, being ready, the clerk of the arraigns on the circuit proceeds to administer to each of them the following oath : \" You shall well and truly try, and true deliverance make between our Sovereign Lady the Queen, and . the prisoners at the bar, whom you shall have in charge, and a true verdict give according to the evidence-So help you God.\" And the clerk of the arraigns directs the crier to make proclamation which is made accordingly in the following form (see form, p. 553.)\nCette proclamation a pour but d'informer tous ceux qui peuvent avoir quelque information \u00e0 donner sur l'enqu\u00eate entre Sa Majest\u00e9 et le prisonnier sur aucune trahison f\u00e9lonie on autre crime, d'avoir \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter et qu'il seront \u00e9ntendus, ainsi que tous ceux qui sont obliges par reconnaissance ou obligation de rendre t\u00e9moignage contre le prisonnier, de se pr\u00e9senter pour donner leur t\u00e9moignage, sous peine de forfaire leur cautionnement.\nChitty ajoute ce qui suit \u00e0 propros de cette proclamation :\nBut it is not necessary that this proclamation, which is only for the benefit of the King, should appear on the record, at least the defendant cannot take advantage of the omission. When this proclamation has been read, the trial commences in the manner we shall presently consider.\nWhen the jury have been thus assembled in the jury-box and sworn, the clerk in case of felony calls to the prisoner at the bar, and bids him hold up his hand by saying CD. and then addresses the jury in these words : \"Look upon the prisoner you that are sworn, and hearken to his cause.\" A. B. stands convicted, indicted by the name of A. B., etc., (reading the indictment). Upon this indictment he has been arraigned, upon this arraignment he pleaded not guilty, and for his trial has put himself upon God and the country which country you are. So that your charge is to enquire whether he be guilty of the high treason Tor felony), whereof he stands indicted, or not guilty.''\nWhen the indictment has thus been read and the jury addressed, if it is a cause of any importance, the indictment is usually opened and the evidence arranged and examined and enforced by the counsel for the prosecution, etc., etc. On volt que Chitty fixe clairement le moment o\u00f9 commence le proc\u00e8s : C'est apr\u00e8s la lecture de la proclamation appelant toutes personnes ayant des informations \u00e0 donner et tous t\u00e9moins ou autres ayant des t\u00e9moignages \u00e0 rendre contre le prisonnier, \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter pour \u00eatre entendues, Sous peine de forfaire leurs cautionnements. When, dit-il, this proclamation has been read, the trial commences in the manner we shall presently consider. Cette mani\u00e8re est indiqu\u00e9e dans les citations queje viens de lire. En faisant application de cette division de la proc\u00e9dure d'un proc\u00e8s criminel en deux parties, la premi\u00e8re consistant dans les proc\u00e9dures pr\u00e9liminaires et la seconde dans le trial proprement dit la sec. 266 devient tout \u00e0 fait intelligible et l'on comprend que il y a une partie de la proc\u00e9dure o\u00f9 il ne peut y avoir de r\u20acifus de r\u00e9server une question de droit, c'est dans la partie pr\u00e9liminaire. La premi\u00e8re partie de la section 266, s'applique \u00e9videmment \u00e0 la question actuelle qui n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e au sujet du stand aside, que dans la partie pr\u00e9liminaire de la proc\u00e9dure et avant que le proc\u00e8s ne f\u00fbt commenc\u00e9. Interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de cette mani\u00e8re les deux parties de cette clause peuvent recevoir leur application. La premi\u00e8re n'affecte nullement le droit du prisonnier d'obtenir un bref d'erreur parceque la question n'a pu \u00eatre r\u00e9serv\u00e9e; la seconde peut aussi recevoir son effet s'il y a eu refus de r\u00e9server au proc\u00e8s on trial. Les deux parties ont alors un sens complet et doivent recevoir leur effet\nDans la cause de Brisebois v. La Reine la majorit\u00e9 de cette cour a adopt\u00e9 la distinction des questions r\u00e9serv\u00e9s au proc\u00e8s trial d'avec celles qui n'ont pu l'\u00eatre. Le juge en chef de cette cour, Sir Wiliiam Ritchie, C.J. s'est exprim\u00e9 comme suit \u00e0 ce sujet ([28]) :\nI am of opinion this was not a question arising at the trial, but it was an objection raised subsequent to the trial, and which could only be determined on a writ of error and could not be reserved and disposed of in a summary manner by affidavits. I am therefore of opinion that as this was not a question on the trial which could be reserved, the Court of Queen's Bench in Montreal had no jurisdiction to adjudicate on the case and, consequently, we have none, the prisoner's remedy, if ' any, being by writ of error.\nCette doctrine ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 proclam\u00e9e par la majorit\u00e9 de la cour forme un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent auquel nous devons nous conformer tant qu'il sera en force. En cons\u00e9quence je crois que c'est avec raison que le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a donn\u00e9 son fiat pour l'\u00e9manation du bref d'erreur sur le principe que la question du stand aside n'avait Pu \u00eatre r\u00e9serv\u00e9.\nPour qu'un bref d'erreur puisse \u00eatre \u00e9man\u00e9, il y a d'abord une formalit\u00e9 essentielle \u00e0 remplir, c'est d'obtenir le fiat du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qu'il peut accorder ou refuser \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion. lans l'exercice de ce pouvoir ii n'est en aucune mani\u00e8re sujet au contr\u00f4le de la cour.\nThe court cannot control the exercise of the discretion left to the attorney general on this subject ([29]). The court will not interfere with the discretion of the Attorney General when he has granted the writ ([30])\nLa restriction impos\u00e9e par la section 266 ne devrait elle pas \u00eatre plut\u00f4t consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme adress\u00e9e au procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et non \u00e0 la cour N'a-t-elle pas plut\u00f4t pour seul objet de servir de direction au procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans la consid\u00e9ration de la question de savoir s'il accordera ou refusera son fiat. Mais ayant jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de permettre l'\u00e9mission du bref sans y avoir impose aucune condition ou restriction, ne doit-on pas conclure qu'apr\u00e8s un mur examen des faits de la cause, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a trouv\u00e9 dans les refus r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s du juge d'obliger la couronne \u00e0 montrer cause pour les r\u00e9cusations r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es, un refus certainement \u00e9quivalent an refus de r\u00e9server la question. 11 a sans doute satisfait sa conscience que ce refus d'ordonner de montrer cause \u00e9tait un refus suffisant de r\u00e9server la question, surtout lorsque ce refus a \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e2t de fois r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9.\nIt cannot issue (the writ of error) now without a fiat from the Attorney General, who always determines whether it be sought merely for delay, or upon a probable error ([31]).\nMaintenant que le bref est \u00e9mis et qu'il est devant la cour sur une contestation r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement li\u00e9e et mettant directement en issue les d\u00e9fauts qu'il v a en dans l'appel des jur\u00e9s et dans les r\u00e9cusations, et sans qu'il y ait eu de r\u00e9ponse en droit aux griefs d'erreur, ni aucune objection particuli\u00e8re relativement au d\u00e9faut de question r\u00e9serv\u00e9e par le juge, la cour peut-elle \u00e9viter de d\u00e9cider la question soul\u00e8ve, lors de La formation du jury sur la pr\u00e9tention de la couronne \u00e0 un second stand aside ? Elle ne le peut pas, d'apr\u00e8s toutes les autorit\u00e9s du droit anglais. Lorsqu'elle a le dossier devant elle, elle doit non-seulement d\u00e9cider les questions d'erreur particuli\u00e8rement invoqu\u00e9es, mais elle doit aussi prendre connaissance de toute question apparaissant par le dossier qui serait suf\u00edsante pour faire mettre de cot\u00e9 le verdict, lors m\u00eame qu'il n'en aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pris avantage par les griefs d'erreur. La cour n'est pas d\u00e9charg\u00e9e de ce devoir par la section 266, qui n'a pas eu l'effet d'annuler ces dispositions concernant le bref d'erreur.\nLa cour du Banc de la Reine a plusieurs fois agi d'apr\u00e8s ce principe eu maintenant des brefs d'erreur pour des moyens non-assign\u00e9s par le demandeur, et qui u'avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 ni r\u00e9serv\u00e9s ni refuses en premi\u00e8re instance.\nDans La cause de Regina v. Ling ([32]), le bref d'erreur a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenu pour une erreur qui n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 as sign\u00e9e et au sujet de laquelle partant nulle question n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9serve. Il s'agissait :\nD'un indictement pour parjure all\u00e9gu\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 commis dans une certaine cause o\u00f9 un nomm\u00e9 Adrien Girardin, du township de Kingsey, dans le district d'Arthabaska, commer\u00e7ant, et un nomm\u00e9 Thomas Ling, du m\u00eame lieu farmer, \u00e9tait d\u00e9fendeur, l'omission des mots \u00e9tait demandeur \u00e0 la suite de la description de Girardin, fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9e fatale et La conviction annul\u00e9e. Cette omission n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e dans lee griefs d'erreur; elle ne fut signal\u00e9e que par la cour elle-m\u00eame.\nLa cour fonda son opinion sur l'autorit\u00e9 suivante :\nThe court is not limited to the errors assigned, the whole record is before the court, and the prisoner has the right to the benefit of all substantial defects in it and the conviction will be quashed if such defect exists. Regina v. Fox ([33]).\nPuisque la cour nonobstant la section.266, est obligee de prendre connaissance de toute erreur apparaissant \u00e0 la face du dossier, suffisante pour faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le verdict, la question Se r\u00e9duirait donc \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si l'erreur commise lors de l'appel du jury \u00e9tait de nature \u00e0 affecter les droits du prisonnier.\nLa seconde r\u00e9cusation ou stand aside, accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la couronne \u00e9tait-elle l\u00e9gale ? Peut-elle \u00e0 son gr\u00e9 faire r\u00e9p\u00e9ter l'appel des jur\u00e9s et les faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 non seulement une fois mais deux et m\u00eame ind\u00e9finiment, de mani\u00e8re enfin vu le nombre limit\u00e9 que le prisonnier peut r\u00e9cuser \u00e0 le forcer d'accepter son proc\u00e8s devant un jury qui n'aurait pas le caract\u00e8re d'impartialit\u00e9 voulu par la loi.\nLa loi a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la couronne des garanties suffisantes pour assurer la bonne administration de la justice, en lui permettant d'abord de demander le stand aside des jures jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la liste ait \u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement appel\u00e9e, gone through; elle a en outre droit \u00e0 quatre r\u00e9cusations p\u00e9remptoires qu'elle peut exercer sans en donner de motif en outre de celles pour lesquelles elle peut montrer des causes suffisantes. Il serait donc injuste et ill\u00e9gal de lui accorder un privil\u00e8ge comme celui du stand aside r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 qui aurait l'effet d'an\u00e9antir le droit de r\u00e9cusation du prisonnier, et, de laisser pratiquement \u00e0 la couronne le pouvoir de former le jury \u00e0 sa guise, ou suivant l'expression anglaise to pack the jury.\nCette question s'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9sente devant nos cours. La seule cause o\u00f9 l'affirmative du stand aside r\u00e9D\u00e9t\u00e9 ait \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue est celle de la Reine v. Lacombe ([34]). La cour \u00e9tait compos\u00e9e de quatre juges, un seul, l'hon. juge Drummond a diff\u00e9r\u00e9 d'opinion. En r\u00e9f\u00e9rant au rapport on voit que cette d\u00e9cision est fond\u00e9e sur le proc\u00e8dent anglais dans l'affaire de Mansell ([35]), qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme ayant d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la couronne avait droit \u00e0 un second stand aside. Ce n'est certainement pas La port\u00e9e de la d\u00e9cision, et elle n'est nullement applicable au cas actuel.\nDans la cause de Mansell le r\u00f4le des jur\u00e9s n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 Cpuis\u00e9, gone through. Onze jur\u00e9s avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 assermentes et ii en manquait un douzi\u00e8me. Alors on recommen\u00e7a l'appel de la liste, et \u00e0 l'appel du nom de Ironmonger l'avocat de la couronne demanda encore une fois le stand aside, pour ce jur\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 mis de c\u00f4t\u00e9 une fois. Dans le m\u00eame moment douze jur\u00e9s qui d\u00e9lib\u00e9raient sur un autre proc\u00e8s formant partie du m\u00eame panel, rentr\u00e8rent en cour pour donner leur verdict, et se trouv\u00e8rent disponibles. La question du droit \u00e0 un second stand aside \u00e9tait actuellement en discussion devant la cour. Le stand aside de Ironmonoger ne fut maintenu que temporairement parce qu'il fut alors repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 que La liste n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9puis\u00e9e, gone through. En effet les douze jur\u00e9s qui venaient d'arriver en cour et qui n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s le furent alors. Jusque l\u00e0 la liste n'avaient pas Ct\u00e9 \u00e9puis\u00e9e, mais elle le fut apr\u00e8s l'appel des noms de douze jur\u00e9s qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 absents\nDans le jugement de Lord Campbell C.J., apr\u00e8s avoir expos\u00e9 tous les faits, ii s'exprime ainsi;\nBut we are of opinion that the panel is not to be considered as gone through so as to require the crown to assign cause of challenge till it is exhausted, i.e., according to the usual practice of the court and what may reasonably he done the fact is ascertained that there are no .more of the jurors on the panel whose attendance may be procured, and that, without requiring the crown to assign cause of challenge the trial could not proceed. In the present case the panel had not been exhausted, although once called over, and the twelve jurors who had served on Chapman's jury came into court when only nine jurors had been elected and sworn for Mansell's jury and when the remaining three might be taken from three twelve as conveniently and as much for the advantage of the prisoner as if they had all been in court and had answered to their names when the panel was first called over.\nPlus loin, page 397, Lord Campbell ajoute :\nAccordingly the course has invariably been from the passing of the statute to the present time, to permit the crown to challenge without cause till the panel has been called over and exhausted, and then to call over the names of the jurors peremptorily challenged by the crown and to put the crown to assign cause so if twelve of those upon the panel remain as to whom no just cause of objection can be assigned the trial may proceed. In our books of authority the rule is laid down that \"The King need not show cause of his challenge till the whole panel be gone through and it appear that three will not be a full jury without the person so challenged.\"\nCockburn C.J., apr\u00e8s avoir fait allusion aux diff\u00e9rentes mani\u00e8res d'appeler la liste des jur\u00e9s, dit :\nHere they were called in the order on the panel; but the twelve absent jurymen were not called, because it was known where they were and that it would be useless to call then The panel then was not gone through so far as those twelve jurors were concerned, it was not exhausted as to them. Now it being conceded that the Crown was not bound to assign cause of challenge till the panel was gone through it seems to me that it cannot be said that the panel was gone through till those twelve jurymen had been called and the Crown and the prisoner respectively had said whether they challenge them or not.\nWilles J., dit an sujet de la seconde demande destand aside ([36]) :\nThe application by the crown that Iremonger should stand by the second trial was a continuance of a previous objection, a demand for further time to show cause rather than a fresh challenge * and in my opinion the panel had not then been gone through, so as to make it incumbent on the crown to show cause of challenge. Chamell B., dit : ([37]).\nThe main question is whether the panel was perused when Ire-monger was called the second time; I think it was not, and that the time to put the crown to show cause of challenge had not then arrived\nChitty, Crim. Law, ([38]).\nBut it is agreed that under this statute, the crown is not compelled to show any cause of challenge until the panel is gone through, so that it may appear that three will not he sufficient to try the prisoner, if the peremptory objection is admitted to prevail.\nLors de l'arriv\u00e9 des douze jur\u00e9s qui n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s le stand aside do Ironmonger n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9, et au lieu de d\u00e9cider cette question, le juge qui pr\u00e9sidait permit d'appeler les douzc jur\u00e9s qui venaient d'entrer et le jury put \u00eatre compl\u00e9t\u00e9. C'est done dans ces circonstances que s'\u00e9leva-la question de savoir si le challenge de Ironmonger n'aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e et la couronne oblig\u00e9e de montrer cause. Mais le juge d\u00e9cida que la liste n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 Puis\u00e9e, gone through vu l'arriv\u00e9e de douze nouveaux jur\u00e9s. Cette d\u00e9cision fut confirm\u00e9e par les juges de la cour du Banc de La Reine dont l'opini\u00f3n est cit\u00e9e ci-dessus Il ne fut nullement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la couronne avait droit \u00e0 un second stand aside. On voit au contraire que l'opinion des juges est contre cette proposition; ils ont admis le principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par le premier juge que la liste des jur\u00e9s devait \u00eatre Puis\u00e9e., gone through, avant de forcer la couronne \u00e0 montrer cause pour ses r\u00e9cusations. Ce pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent qui a servi de base \u00e0 lad\u00e9cision de la Reine v. Lacombe, n'a done nullement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la couronne avait doit \u00e0 plus d'un stand aside, tout au contraire, l'opinion des juges a \u00e9t\u00e9 qu'une fois la liste \u00e9puis\u00e9e, gone through, au deuxi\u00e8me appel des jur\u00e9s, la couronne doit donner ses causes de r\u00e9cusation. C'est done \u00e0 tort que la cour du Banc de la Reine s'est appuy\u00e9e sur ce proc\u00e8dent pour maintenir dans La cause de Lacombe que la couronne avait droit \u00e0 un deuxi\u00e8me stand aside. Ce proc\u00e8dent \u00eatant encore en force lors de la d\u00e9cision de l'hon, juge dans cette cause, ii n'est pas surprenant qu'il s'y soit conforme, car c'\u00e9tait une d\u00e9cision de sa propre cour. Mais ce proc\u00e8dent est isol\u00e9; ii n'en existe pas un seul de cc genre en Angleterre. Cockburn C. J. dit \u00e0 ce sujet :\nThere is no case in the books by which it appears that a juror who lias been once set aside at the instance of the crown has been again set aside at the instance of the crown without cause of challenge being shown.\nDans La cause de Regina v. Dougall ([39]), La moiti\u00e9 ne peut seulement de la liste avait \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e et la d\u00e9cision s'appliquer au cas actuel o\u00f9 toute la liste avait \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e.\nIl n'existe pas non plus dans Ontario de cas o\u00f9 ii ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la liste pouvait \u00eatre appel\u00e9e deux fois avant que la Couronne put \u00eatre oblig\u00e9e \u00e0 donner ses causes de r\u00e9cusation. Dans Regina v. Benjamin ([40]), on attribue \u00e0 M. Richards qui repr\u00e9sentait la Couronne le langage suivant \u00e0 ce sujet :\nThen in going over the panel a second time the crown must assign a cause certain, which is then inquired of by the court.\nIl semble avoir exprim\u00e9 l'opinion dominante sur cette question, dans la province d'Ontario, car on ne trouve nulle part la contradiction de cette doctrine.\n\u201cBishop on Criminal Procedure\u201d ([41]), r\u00e9sume bien la doctrine comme suit :\nThe course of things is, therefore, in England and in those States of the Union in which the English practice prevails, for the court, when the list of jurors is being called over and the prisoner is being required to accept or challenge each juror, to direct such jurors to stand aside as are objected to on behalf of the prosecution. The panel is thus gone through with. But if a full jury is not thus obtained, then the panel is called over a second time, omitting those whose cases have been finally disposed of, yet including both those who did not answer and those who were set aside at the instance of the prosecution, and on this second call the Government can challenge only for cause.\nIci sont cit\u00e9s plusieurs pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents anglais, et entr'autres Regina v. Mansell.\nToutes les autorit\u00e9s font clairement voir que la Couronne doit au deuxi\u00e8me appel des jur\u00e9s, apr\u00e8s avoir exerc\u00e9 le stand aside une fois, montrer cause pour ses r\u00e9cusations. C'est ce que le juge a positivement refuse de faire en cette cause onze fois de suite. La liste des jur\u00e9s avait alors toute \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e une premi\u00e8re fois tel que le constate le record. L'absence de ceux qui n'avaient pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 l'appel fut r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement not\u00e9e et il n'y a aucune preuve qu'aucun de ces jur\u00e9s fut pr\u00e9sent en cour lors du second appel. Il n'y avait donc absolument aucune raison de faire le second appel Si ce n'est pour donner \u00e0 La Couronne le privil\u00e8ge du second stand aside auquel elle n'avait aucun droit\nCette erreur commise dans la constitution du jury peut avoir eu les plus graves cons\u00e9quences pour le prisonnier. Elle est en violation de La loi qui exige la plus stricte impartialit\u00e9 dans la formation du jury, et est une cause suffisante d'erreur pour faire annuler le proc\u00e8s S'il en \u00e9tait autrement, je dirais avec Cockburn C. J., dans la cause de Mansell:\nIt would be monstrous to common sense to affirm that where it is admitted that three has been an improper selection of the jury the prisoner shall have no remedy; and if it is not a ground of error three is no remedy, as a bill of exception will not lie in a case of felony.\nEn cons\u00e9quence je suis d'avis que le bref d'erreur doit \u00eatre maintenu.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed on the ground taken by the Court of Queen's Bench, that the question raised by the prisoner on the order given by the learned judge, at the trial, to eleven jurors to stand aside a second time at the instance of the crown could have been reserved, and that con sequently, under section 266 of the Procedure Act as the judge did not refuse to reserve it the writ of error does not lie. The proposition that the question is one that could have been reserved has been so elaborately treated by my brother Patterson that I might content myself with concurring in his remarks. In fact, were it not for the opinions expressed here to-day I would have thought the point free from any doubt. And, I venture to say if the learned judge at the trial in this case had reserved the question it would never have been thought of, either at the bar or on the bench, to question his right to do so. The eminent counsel himself who argued the case before us for the plaintiff in error did not feel justified in taking the ground that the question was one which could not have been reserved. And Mr.. Justice Tessier, in the Court of Queen's Bench, who dissented from the judgment of the court on other points far from holding that the question could not have been reserved, on the contrary, assumes that it could have been.\nTo the cases which will be cited by my brother Patterson on this proposition, I add the following : Levinger v. The Queen, in the Privy Council ([42]); Reg. v. Manning ([43]); Beg. v. Burgess ([44]); also, Reg. v. Tew ([45]) where the question reserved was whether the witnesses before their examination before the grand jury had been properly sworn, a question which, Lord Campbell said, as presented in the case, was unfounded, frivolous and discreditable, but upon which, however, the court assumed jurisdiction.\nNow here was a case reserved on a proceeding before even a bill had been found by the grand jury. It is an extreme and perhaps a questionable one. I cite it however to show how far the courts in England. have gone in the construction of the court of crown cases reserved act. See also Reg. v. Key ([46]); and Reg. v. Shutlleworth ([47]) * in which questions were reserved on the mode of arraignment where a previous conviction is charged.\nIn New Brunswick the case of The Queen v. Morr\u00edson ([48]); and in Quebec, amongst others, the cases R. v. Lacombe ([49]) R. v. Fraser ([50]) and R. v. Chamailard ([51]), may also be referred to.\nThen, in this court itself, there are two cases in point. In Abrahams v. The Queen ([52]) the prisoner had moved to quash the indictment on the ground that it had been submitted to the grand jury without proper authority, it being one falling under the vexatious indictments clause now sec. 140 of the Procedure Act. It appeared that the indictment purported to have been authorised by the attorney-general, but that this had been done, not by the attorney-general himself but by the counsel who represented him at that term of the court. After conviction the presiding judge reserved the question so raised on the motion to quash. The Court of Queen's Bench, in Montreal, held that the objection was not well founded. But on appeal to this court that judgment was reversed, and the indictment was quashed.\nNow that was clearly an objection not only arising but also taken before a jury was made up, nay, even before the prisoner pleaded to the indictment as it must necessarily have been under section 143 of the Procedure Act. Yet it was never questioned either at the bar or on the bench either in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, or in this court, but that the case was on which was properly reserved. Are we here to-day to hold that we had no right to quash the conviction i that case as we did? A question precisely similar in England, I may add, in R. v. Fuidge ([53]) was reserved and the indictment also quashed by the full court; and there also it was nowhere doubted that the question was one which was properly reserved.\nThe other case in this court I have alluded to i Theal v. The Queen ([54]). One of the points reserved by the judge who had presided at the trial in that case was upon a motion to quash the indictment which had been moved by the prisoner, upon arraign ment before pleading. The case went through the full Court of New Brunswick and then was appealed here and not a doubt either in New Brunswick o; here was expressed as to the jurisdiction of the cour of crown cases reserved upon the point raised by the motion to quash.\nIt has been suggested that by the giving to the word \" trial\" in section 259 of the Procedure Act the wide interpretation that it has to the pre present day unquestionably received in England and in Canada, prisoners in criminal cases by section 266 o; this same Act will be deprived in many cases of the beneficial right to a writ of error. That is so, undoubtedly, but in my opinion such is the clear intention of the statute. It was thought expediet not to allow the two remedies to a prisoner the writ of error and the reservation for the court of crown cases Neither one nor the other it must be observed is grantable as a matter of right. The attorney general, it is true would not refuse his fiat for a writ of error where a serious ground of error is assigned, though he should be careful not to grant it where it is expressly taken away by the statute. But it is equally true that the judge presiding at the trial not only would not refuse to reserve but even of himself and ex propriomotu would reserve, any question of law upon which he might have serious doubts. And a reference to the cases in the court of crown cases reserved both in England and in Canada, since its establishment fully shows that the judges presiding at trials of criminal cases have as the full court itself, given the widest interpretation to the statute, and liberally exercised in favor of accused parties the powers it conferred upon them whenever serious doubts arose on any question of law. And then, in the case now before us how could it be said that a question whether the prisoner has had his trial according to law or by a jury lawfully constituted, is not a question arising at the trial?\nIn a late case, 1889, Reg. v. Brown ([55]), Lord Coleridge reserved a case not only after the trial, but even after the term of the court had ended and after he had left the assize town and this where the prisoner had pleaded guilty, and the full court held that they had jurisdiction. Referring to a previous case, Reg. v. Clark ([56]) where it had been held that no case can be reserved when a prisoner pleads guilty, the Chief Justice, for the court, said :\u2014\nIf that judgment intends that because a man pleads guilty\u2014the judge who tried the case cannot state a case asking for the opinion of this court as to the validity of the conviction, we must respectfully differ from it In this case the indictment was read to the prisoner and if, upon it being read, he had taken the objection, it would clearly have been a point arising at the trial; and the mere fact that he did not take it but that it arose in the mind of the judge afterwards does not tender it any less a point which arose at the trial Whether it was taken by the prisoner or not, it existed, and the point was there. We think, therefore, that we have jurisdiction to consider this case. Now we have in that case the latest instance, and I may say perhaps one of the most illustrative, of the liberality with which in England the statute applying to the court of crown cases reserved has been inter preted. And when we are asked here today, by the construction sought to be given to curtail the jurisdiction of that court, and to put upon this highly remedial statute a narrower construction than it has received for over forty years, I think we should pause before coming to that conclusion. We should be loath to abridge rights and remedies which have proved so effectual in the administration of the criminal law and so well calculated to ensure to accused parties the protection the law of the land entitles them to on their trial\nA reference has been made to Brisebois v. The Queen ([57]) as a decision by this court from which it could be inferred that we had refused to adopt the large construction given to the word \"trial\" in sec. 259 of the Pro cedure Act in prior cases. Now I am sure that neither his lordship nor my brother Gwynne, who with myself composed the majority of the court in that case on the question, whether the question there submitted had legally been reserved or not, intended to question Abra hams v. The Queen ([58]) and Theal v. The Queen ([59]) which I have referred to or in any manner throw the least doubt upon the jurisdiction of this court in those cases.\nThat case of Brisebois has no application whatever to the present one. There the learned judge presiding at the trial after the verdict on a motion in arrest of judgment had illegally, as we thought, tried, upon affidavits a question of fact, which not only did not appear on the record but which was in direct contradiction of the record. The error assigned there, if any there was or could he legally proved, was error in fact. Now, we held that this was irregular, that no motion in arrest of judgment lies upon a fact not appearing on the record, and that the learned judge had no power after verdict to receive affidavits and try an issue of fact to contradict the record as he had done ([60]) and that consequently he could not, assuming these facts as proved, reserve a question of law upon them. Bowsse v. Cannington ([61]). I need only refer to the remarks of my brother Gwynne who gave the judgment of the court upon this point, at page 454 of the report, to show that this was all that was determined in that case.\nI have also great doubts if an order to a juror to stand aside, which merely means that the juror being challenged by the crown the consideration of the challenge shall be postponed till it be ascertained whether or not a full jury can be made without him ([62]) raises a question of law upon which the writ of error lies. I refer on this point to Gregory v. Reg. ([63]), Mansell v. Reg. in the Court of Exchequer Chamber ([64]) Whe Ian v. Reg. ([65]) and the cases there cited also to Chief Justice Harrison's judgment in R. v. Smith ([66]). Section 124 of the Criminal Law Procedure Act it has been suggested, would have the effect now to make in Canada such a question one of law. But, as it would seem to me the only new enactment in that section is the allowance of four peremptory challenges to the crown; the subsequent words, \" but this shall not be construed to affect the right of the crown to cause any juror to stand aside until the panel has been gone through,\" import no changes in the law or practice as to the order to \" stand aside.\" I read the clause as if it said : The crown shall have four peremptory challenges but this shall not interfere with the right of the crown to cause any juror to stand aside which right shall continue to exist as it has existed heretofore. I am confirmed in this view by section 170 of the same act which enacts that :\nNothing in this act shall alter, abridge or affect any power or authority which any court or judge has, when this act takes effect, or any practice or form in regard to trials by jury, jury process, juries or jurors, except in cases where such power or authority is expressly altered, or is inconsistent with the provisions of this act.\nThe order given by the judge at the trial which the plaintiff in error impugns, it must be remembered, is not an allowance of a peremptory challenge at the instance of the crown to which a demurrer raising a question had been pleaded by the prisoner but merely an order on a challenge for cause by the crown, which postponed the consideration of the challenge till it was ascertained whether a full jury could not be had without the juror so challenged, and to which the prisoner had objected in the only way he could do, by asking that the crown be ordered to show cause forthwith, and I find it difficult to say that this raised a question of law that could be the ground of a writ of error.\nHowever, it is unnecessary for me to determine this point, as upon the ground I first mentioned I am of opinion that the judgment appealed from, which quashed this writ, was right, and that the appeal by the plaintiff in error should be dismissed.\nHaving come to this determination it seems to me that I should not enter into the consideration of the merit of the ground of error assigned by the plaintiff in error. As we are equally divided in this court the result is that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench which held that the writ of error does not lie, stands. It follows, it seems to me, that anything 1 would say here on the merits would be obiter and extra judicial. If the Writ of error does not lie, as results from the judgment of this court, I do not see how I would be justified in giving a judgment on the errors assigned, and assume jurisdiction after our judgment determines that we have no jurisdiction. The course pursued in the court below where the learned judges refrained from going into the merits is the proper one, in my opinion ([67]). However, as a majority of my brother judges have expressed their opinions that the error assigned as to the order to certain jurors to stand aside a second time at the instance of the crown is a good ground of error, I deem it right to make an observation as to the course pursued by the learned counsel who acted for the attorney general, and by the learned judge who presided at the trial in this case. In 1869 in a case of Reg. v. Lacombe ([68]) the full Court of Queen's Bench, in Montreal, upon a case reserved, held that on the second calling over of a jury list under circumstances precisely similar to the present one the crown had the right to have a juror stand aside a second time without showing cause. Now, it is obvious that with this ruling of the highest court of the province before him the learned counsel for the crown in this case was perfectly justified to take the course he did at the trial and that the learned judge who presided could not have been expected, acting there as he was in the capacity of a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench, to assume the responsibility of reversing a jurisprudence settled by that court over twenly years before, and which had remained unchallenged ever since. I can.see nothing on this record to create the least doubt but that this prisoner got a fair trial. The right of challenging is given to reject, not to select and as seven of his peremptory challenges were not taken he must be assumed to have been tried. by a jury composed of twelve men indifferent, properly qualified, and to none of whom he had any objection.\nGWYNEE J.\u2014The objection taken in this case, if it should prevail, must do so upon the ground that there was such a substantial defect in the formation of the jury as constituted a mistrial, such a defect, therefore as would have entitled the crown to have avoided the verdict if it had been one of acquittal. This consideration makes it a matter of the gravest importance in the interest of the accused parties that whenever a question of mistrial is raised care should be taken that mere irregularities not working any prejudice to the accused upon his trial shall not be magnified into nullities avoiding a trial. It is not every irregularity upon the trial of a person upon a criminal charge that will constitute a mistrial. It would be most disastrous as well to the due administration of the law as to the interest of the accused parties themselves if it should do so. The language of several of the learned judges in Mellor's Jase ([69]) is very applicable to the present case. Crompton J, referring to the point in that case, says :\nIt would be very mischievous if every irregularity of this nature would necessarily vacate a verdict; if it would necessarily have that effect the same principle would apply in the case of an acquittal even though the irregularity were caused by the prosecution. The extreme mischief should make us cautious in seeing that the strict rules of law are not extended in such a manner that at every assizes and sessions we should be in danger of hearing of verdicts being set aside by accidental or contrived irregularities like those in question.\nCrowder J. says :\nVerdicts found at the assizes and quarter sessions after the most patient and careful investigation where the trials have been with the utmost impartiality, and the results have been most satisfactory to the ends of justice, might be set aside and the prisoners, if convicted, might have another chance of escape, or if acquitted might have their lives and liberties again imperiled by another trial, for if such a mistake is fatal to the trial it is equally so whether the verdict pass for or against the prisoner, and whatever the nature of the crime may be with which he is charged.\nWilles J. says :\nIf this was a mistake, the Prisoner being convicted, it would equally have been a mistrial in case of acquittal; but to order a venire de novo in the latter case would be scandalous and oppressive.\nAnd Byles J. says :\nA mere possibility of prejudiece cannot vitiate the trial. A mistake of this nature is no mistrial. If a mistake of this nature vitiates a verdict against a prisoner, it equally vitiates a verdict for him. The crown may at any time and at any distance of time take similar objections, and the validity of all acquittals is put in jeopardy.\nNow, what is objected to in the present case is simply this : Upon the panel of 40 jurors being once called three did not answer to their names when called and twelve having been peremptorily challenged by the prisoner, and fourteen required to stand aside by the crown when eleven jurors only were obtained and sworn the clerk then, instead of calling again the three who had not answered to their names, proceeded to go through the panel again in the same order as before only omitting those who had been peremptorily challenged, when the crown, upon the persons they had required to stand aside being again called in their order as before, again prayed that the period for assign ing cause might be further postponed until the panel should be once again thus gone through, and the learned judge decided in favor of the crown, against the contention of the prisoner's counsel that the crown should be compelled to assign cause of challenge upon each of those who had been required to stand aside being called again; in this manner, accordingly, the panel, excluding those who had been peremptorily challenged by the prisoner, was once again gone through, until at length, when it appeared that the three jurors who had been absent when first called were still absent when called a second time in the order in which they were upon the panel the twelfth juror was obtained by the crown no longer requiring him to stand aside. To this juror so obtained the prisoner, although he still had several challenges or rights of challenge remaining, offered no objection and it is not alleged that in point of fact he had any objection to him, and thus a complete jury was obtained. Now, if in such a case the crown upon a verdict of acquittal being rendered should demand a venire de novo, upon the grounds of there having been such a defect in the formation of the jury as constituted a mistrial, the language of Willes J. in Mellow's case ([70]) may not inaptly be applied : \"To order a venire de novo in such a case would be scandalous and oppressive;\" and if the crown could not obtain a venire de novo in the present case if a verdict of acquittal had been rendered the prisoner cannot upon a verdict of guilty. So likewise I may adopt the language of Crowder J. in the same case as eminently appropriate to the present, where he says :\nBefore I can arrive at the conclusion that a verdict found by such a jury so empanelled is a nullity, I must be satisfied that there exists some stringent and inflexible rule of law which goes the length of avoiding every criminal trial when such a mistake however unattended with the slightest mischief, has occurred, but I can find no such rule of law.\nIf a procedure such as that which is objected to in the present case constituted a mistrial, the apprehensions entertained by By les J., as expressed by him in the same case may be said to be fulfilled and henceforth, in this portion at least of the British Empire\u2014\nNew trials in criminal cases will come in like a flood A mere pos sibility of prejudice cannot vititiate the trial. If a procedure of the nature in question here vitiates a verdict against a prisoner it equally vitiates a verdict for him. The crown may at any time and at any distance of time take a similar objection, and the validity of all acquittals is put in jeopardy.\nIt is in the interest of those accused of crime there-fore, that we should hold that the procedure which is objected to in the present case did not constitute a mistrial\nThe language of Bram well B. in Mansell's case ([71]), and which was not dissented from by any of the learned judges in that case, has also an important bearing upon the objection taken in the present case.\nHe there says :\nAccording to my judgment the matter relied on to found the objection ought not to have appeared upon the record, and if it is ex aminable it is not error.\nWilles J. was of the same opinion, although he abstained from pronouncing judgment upon it, because, as he said:\nAssuming that a court of error ought to pronounce an opinion, and that it is a matter properly upon the record, I am of opinion that the judgment below ought to be affirmed.\nAgain, Bram well B. says:\nIt is now an application to the discretion of the judge whether or not the showing of cause of challenge on the part of the prisoner should be adjourned, and that is so reasonable that, I think, it ought to be admitted. But the delay in showing cause on the part of the crown, which was wholly discretionary at first has in accordance with the practice become a right, and the judge would do wrong if he did not admit it as matter of right to the crown. In my view, consistently with that, although the panel had been gone through once, the judge might the second time, on reasonable ground, grant the application of the crown to adjourn the showing cause of challenge, or rather continue, at the request of the crown, to postpone the obligation of the crown to show cause of its challenge. Still, I think that the application that a juryman should be ordered to stand by is an application to the discretion of the judge at the trial. Therefore, I am compelled to say that the story of it ought not to appear on the record, nor can the discretion of the judge be reversed in a court of error.\nAnd again he says :\nSo long as there are men in court on the panel who were called before and had not answered, the necessity for the crown showing cause has not arisen The rule must at least be this that until each man who could answer has answered and there are still not twelve men in the box the crown need not show cause.\nThat the crown was entitled to have called a second. time the three men who had not answered when the panel was first called cannot, I think, admit of any doubt; the objection, therefore, is reduced to this, that the judge permitted the panel to be gone through again in the same manner as he had been before, omitting those peremptorily challenged, in order to have the three who had not answered called again in this manner before putting the crown to show its cause of challenge. This mode of proceeding, if at all objectionable, can only be objected to as a mere irregularity in procedure which did not deprive the prisoner of any legal right, or do him any prejudice. It did not result in putting upon the jury an unqualified person or one against whom the prisoner had, or is suggested to have had, any objection whatever, and did not, in my opinion, constitute a mistrial in whatever form the objection should be raised. It is however sufficient for the determination of the present case to say that the point raised involved a question of law, which, upon the English authorities and practice, I entertain no doubt whatever could have been reserved as a point of law arising on the trial for the consideration of the court for crown cases reserved under sections 259, 260 and 261 of ch. 174 of the Revised Statutes of Canada. With great deference to my brother Strong, the case of Brisbois v. The Queen ([72]) has, in my opinion, no applica tion whatever in the present case. The points in judgment there were that matter which arose after verdict and was brought to the notice of the judge by affidavits and in such a manner that he could have rendered no judgment upon it, was not matter raising a question of law arising on the trial; and, moreover, that the objection taken was one which the statute expressly declared could not be taken in any shape. In the Queen v. Burgess ([73]), before plea pleaded, and therefore before ever a juror was sworn or called to try the case, the prisoner's counsel moved to quash the indictment upon the contention that though it professed to charge the prisoner with the offence of compounding a felony it did not disclose any offence. The Recorder of London in whose court the case was, overruled the objection, whereupon the prisoner pleaded, was tried and had a verdict of guilty rendered against him and thereupon the learned recorder reserved for the consideration of the court of crown cases reserved the question :\nWhether the indictment was bad on the face of it as not disclosing any offence at law and ought to have been quashed?\nThe court of crown cases reserved entertained the case, and adjudicated upon it. The question was deliberately argued upon the merits and it never occurred either to counsel or to the court that the question was not one which within the meaning of the act which gave the court jurisdiction, arose on the trial, and that the court therefore had no jurisdiction to entertain the case. In Regina v. Brown ([74]), Lord Coleridge C. J., reserved a case for the consideration of the court for crown cases reserved under the following circumstances: The prisoner had pleaded guilty at assizes to an indictment charging him with having attempted to com- mit unnatural offences with domestic fowls and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. After the judge left .the assize town his attention was called to an unreported case which was said to have decided that a duck was not an animal within the meaning of 24 & 25 Vic ch. 100 s. 51, and he thereupon stated a case requesting the opinion of the court for crown cases reserved whether or not the conviction was good ? When pronouncing the judgment of the court, referring to Reg. v. Clark ([75]), Lord Coleridge said:\nIf it is intended by that judgment that because a man pleads guilty any difficulty with respect to the statement of the case against him is immaterial,\u2014that he is absolutely concluded for ever after from taking any point upon it, and that the judge who tries him cannot state a case for the opinion of this court, we respectfully differ from that view, and inasmuch as the prisoner in the present case was indicted and the indictment was read to him and he might then have taken the objection we think the objection was in effect taken. The point was there existing; it might have been taken, and it was a point which in our view did arise on the trial.\nThe court accordingly entertained the case and adjudicated upon it. Without over-ruling these cases it is impossible in my opinion, to hold that no question can be reserved for the consideration of the court for crown cases reserved as one arising on the trial within the meaning of the statute in that behalf unless it be in respect of some matter arising after the jury is selected and sworn. Such a construction would be little short of making null the statute. In the present case no case was reserved, and as the judgment of the court appealed from proceeded upon the ground that, and substantially is an adjudication that,in point of fact, as was also admitted in the argument, the judge who tried the case never was asked or did refuse to reserve a case upon the point for the consideration of the court for crown cases reserved section 266 of ch. 174 enacts that no writ of error shall be allowed in such a case and so in effect that the objection cannot be now raised in error.\nThe appeal therefore should, in my opinion, be dismissed and the \"judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, at Montreal, affirmed.\nPATTERSON J. The writ of error has been quashed by the judgment of the court below on the ground that it is founded on a question of law arising at the trial which could have been reserved for the consideration of the justices of the court for crown cases reserved under the 259th section of the Criminal Procedure Act ([76]), but which the judge presiding at the trial did not reserve, and not having been asked to reserve it, cannot be said to have refused to reserve. The decision proceeds upon the 266th section which unlike the 259th is not taken from the English law, and which declares that in those circumstances no writ of error shall be allowed.\nThe alleged error is in the selection of the jury. When the panel which contained the names of forty jurors had been once perused twelve men had been challenged by the prisoner, fourteen had been ordered on the part of the crown to stand by eleven had been sworn on the \"jury, and three were absent. One jury man was still wanted and he had to be obtained from among the fourteen men who were standing aside, unless all of the fourteen should happen to be challenged either by the crown for cause, or, to the number of four, peremptorily, as permitted by section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Act, or by the prisoner who was still entitled to eight peremptory challenges. On again going through the panel, one of the men was challenged by the prisoner, and the crown was permit- ted, against the objection of the prisoner, to cause eleven of them to stand by a second time. We obtain these facts from the return to the writ of error, where it is further stated that one man of the fourteen was sworn on the jury, completing the twelve jurymen, and one, Augustin V\u00e9zina, does not appear to have been called the second time.\nI see no reason to doubt that the permission to cause the jurors to stand by the second lime was unauthorized. The right of the crown to postpone the assignment of cause for challenging jurors until the panel had been gone through, which has been discussed and explained in several cases the explanations given by judges of eminence not always entirely agreeing, is recognised by section 164 of our Criminal Procedure Act and is preserved notwithstanding the new right of four peremptory challenges which is created by the statute represented in that section, and is of course beyond question. But when the panel has been gone through and the power to cause a juror to stand aside in place of showing cause for challenging him is asserted a second time what is done is not easily distinguishable in its effect from a peremptory challenge, and is not warranted by the authority of any English decision or (beyond the number of four) by section 164. The first four of the eleven might, perhaps, be held in this view to have been properly excluded from the jury as being peremptorily challenged, but the other seven should not have been set aside except for cause.\nThe only English authority cited to the contrary is a dictum of Bramwell B.in the important case of Mansell v. The Queen ([77]) where he expresses the opinion that the judge might, after the panel had been perused, i in his discretioVn for sufficient cause further postpone the time of assigning cause, either for the crown or the prisoner, but not as a matter of right on a mere request without sufficient cause.\" Mansell's case did not require a decision of the point. The contest there arose on the facts which are set out in the return to the writ of error ([78]) that a juror who had been called a second time after the panel had been gone through, with the exception of twelve jurymen who were out of court considering another case, was again required on the part of the crown to stand by, and the twelve men just then returning into court, what was asked and allowed was that the crown should not be put to assign cause for the challenge until after those twelve men had been called. Bramwell B. further explains his opinion, saying:\nI think therefore that even if the twelve whose names had not been called over had not come into court when they did, it might have been right to set aside Iremonger for a longer time, as long as there was reasonable ground for thinking that any one might be brought into court who was liable to serve and had not yet been objected to. The true rule is to postpone the time for assigning cause till all reasonable endeavors to nuke all answer who ought to answer have been exhausted. Then if twelve jurors have not been obtained the crown must show cause but not till then.\nThere is no suggestion that in this case the attend anee of the three defaulting jurymen could by any reasonable effort have been obtained and under the rule laid down by Bramwell B. applied to the facts that we have before us the crown could not in my judgment, object again to any one of the fourteen men who were set aside on the first perusal of the panel except by way of challenge for cause, though there was of course the limited peremptory challenge allowed by section 164. The prisoner was deprived of a legal right in respect of the constitution of the tribunal by which he was to be tried, and I agree with the opinions that have been expressed that the matter is proper to appear on the record. It would therefore be examinable in error unless that proceeding is excluded by the 266th section of the act\nAt the same time I have no idea that under the cir constancies the prisoner suffered any actual prejudice or that his trial was not fair and impartial, having regard to the fact that he could have challenged peremptorily every one of the seven jurors who were, in my opinion, improperly ordered to stand by.\nI think the court below was correct in holding that the case came within the 266th section and in, therefore, quashing the writ of error.'\nOne essential to the allowance of the writ is that the question of law could not have been reserved under section 259 which authorises the reservation of any question of law which arises on the trial. It is contended that the objection to the right of challenge having been taken before the prisoner was given in charge to the jury the question arose before the trial and not on the trial. This construction which confines the term \"i trial l to the trial of the issues by the jury, in which sense the word may be, no doubt, and often is properly used, seems too narrow to give full effect to the intention of the section. In my opinion \"the trial,\" within the meaning of the section, embraces all the proceedings before the judge who is called in section 266 the judge presiding at the trial, whether those proceedings are as in the present case, preliminary to the investigation by the jury; or, as in the instance of a prisoner pleading guilty, result in a conviction without the intervention of a jury* or relate to the evidence or the directions or ruling of the judge; or to the reception or recording of the verdict; or arise after the conviction, as for example, with regard to the appropriateness of the sentence or to the punishment assigned by law to the offence; and whether any such\nquestions are actually mooted while the trial is in progress or have not suggested themselves until the trial is over, the prisoner convicted, and sentence passed, upon him.\nThese views are, as I gather from reported cases, those generally acted upon in England under the statute 11 & 12 Vic ch. 78 sec. 1 which is followed by our section 259.\nI am not aware of any direct English decision upon the immediate point as to when the trial commences. within the meaning of the act but that is because it was never really in dispute.\nMy brother Taschereau has cited a number of cases bearing on the point which I do not think it necessary to refer to again.\nIn Reg. v. Faderman ([79]) the point was raised in argument shortly after the passing of the English act ([80]).\nParke B. said: \" Properly there is no trial till issue is joined;\" and Cresswell J. asked a question which received an affirmative answer in later cases :\" Is a prisoner tried who pleads guilty ?'' The decision did not touch the question, being that the Court of Crown Cases Reserved had not jurisdiction to review the decision which was on demurrer because there had been no conviction. It may be noticed, however, that whatever opinion nay have been implied by the observation of Parke B., and whether or not the impression he had at the moment of the signification of the word \" trial l would have given the proper force to the expression as used in the statute, his dictum does not reach the present case because the joinder of issue takes place before the jury is called In the 8th edition of Trials per Pais, which bears the date of 1176 there is this passage at p. 595, which deals with the joining of issue : When the defendant bath pleaded to the indictment \" not guilty,\" the clerk on behalf of the king or attorney general, by way of replication says \u201cculprit\u201d i.e. culprist, which is an averment of his guilt, and a taking of issue thereupon, as much as paratus est ue rificare quod culpabilis est; the like as in civil actions et hoc paratus verificare, prist in French signifying the same with paratus in Latin; then the prisoner being demanded how he will be tried, answers: \"By God and the country,\" which is the same with a rejoinder and joining issue in a civil action concluding et de hoc ponit se super patriam. So that upon all arraignments there is a formality of pleading observed, in effect the same as in civil actions.\nA year earlier than Faderman's case Rolfe B. had in Reg. v. Martin ([81]) laid down a principle which has prevailed in most, if not in all, subsequent cases. He said :\u2014\u2014\nI think that the word \"trial\" in the 2nd section of 11 & 12 Vic. c. 78 ought to have a very liberal construction, and I think it applies to any proceeding in the court below.\nThe question whether the matter of law for the time in debate arose at the trial has been discussed in several cases, but the objection has usually been that the question was not raised until the trial was over. That was so in Reg. v. Mellor ([82]), in 1858, where the complaint related to the constitution of the jury, but the fact that one juryman had been sworn in place of another was not discovered till after the trial. The jurisdiction of the court for Crown Cases Reserved was discussed on other grounds with considerable divergence of opinion among the fourteen judges who composed the court. On the point as to the question having arisen at the trial there was not much difference. No one suggested that the empanelling of the jury was before the trial. Wiliiams J. thought that the point as it came before the court, must be regarded as a point occurring after verdict and therefore not a question of law which had arisen at the trial within the meaning of the first section of the statute. That opinion, which is discredited by later cases and notably by one decided as late as last year which I shall notice presently, does not appear to have been entertained by any other of the judges, while decided opinions to the contrary were expressed. Lord Campbell C. J. thus dealt with the question:\u2014\nAlthough the question was not discussed, the facts upon which it arises had occurred during the trial, and the judge while still acting under the commission, respited the execution of the sentence and reserved the question for the opinion of this court. It therefore seems to me to be a question of law which arose on the trial. The salutary operation of the statute would be greatly impaired if it were confined to questions of law which had been openly discussed during the trial. Since the statute passed, judges have usefully reserved under it questions as to the admissibility of evidence which had not been discussed during the trial; and if the question might have been discussed before the sentence was pronounced, I think the judge, acting under the commission, has authority to reserve it, and to respite the execution of the sentence.\nColeridge J. said :\nWe are bound to give this Act of Parliament a liberal construction; and I think that when the subject matter of dispute or question is connected with, or took place at the trial, whether it is considered at that time or at a later period, it must be said in point of law to have\nWightman J., by whom the case had been reserved, and who was speaking rather of the merits of the objection than of the question of jurisdiction, remarked:\nIt may be that if the mistake had been discovered before the verdict I might have discharged the juror with respect to whom the objection had arisen, and called another juror, and then have heard the witnesses over again, or I might have given the prisoner the liberty of challenging the juror, with the consent of the counsel for the prosecution. The mistake however was not discovered until after the verdict. It appears to me, therefore, that this was a case of mistrial, and that if the privilege of challenge be of any value at all it might be utterly defeated if this objection is not allowed to prevail.\nAnd Martin B. said : I have always understood that this Act of Parliament was passed for the purpose of amending one of the greatest scandals of the law, that whilst, in civil cases, the most trivial objection entitled the parties as of right to a new trial, a prisoner whose life, as in this case, depends . on the result, was prevented from getting his case reviewed, as to any error of fact, without he adopted a most circuitous and expensive course. I agree that we ought to give the most liberal construction. to this Act of Parliament, for the purpose of giving to a prisoner an opportunity of asserting every right which he legally possesses.\nIn Reg. v. Martin ([83]) decided in 1872, we have a decision upon a case stated on the application of counsel for the prisoner after verdict and sentence.\nIn Reg. v. Brown ([84]), in 1889, before Lord Coleridge C.J., the prisoner pleaded guilty and was sentenced. After the Lord Chief Justice had left the assize town he was informed of a decision which created in his mind a doubt as to the offence coming within the statute under which the prisoner was charged, and he therefore stated the case which was considered by the court. The case of Reg. v. Clark ([85]) was referred to with disapproval as a decision that a case cannot be reserved after a plea of guilty. That had been so held in Reg. v. Clark, on the ground that the question did not arise at the trial, not, however, from any suggestion that the arraignment and the plea did not take place at the trial but because the court considered that the prisoner having pleaded guilty without taking any objection to the legal sufficiency of the charge, it could not be said that the question whether the act charged was an offence within a certain statute, on which question the judge asked the opinion of the court, was a question arising on the trial. I shall read the concluding remarks of Cockburn C. J from the Jurist where the language is given more fully than in the regular report: But inasmuch as the power to state case only applies where a question arises on the trial we have no jurisdiction. The prisoner having pleaded guilty, no question arose on the trial. A man who pleads guilty must be taken to know the law.\nThus the decision in Reg. Clark, whether sound or unsound, is foreign to the present discussion.\nThe question reserved and disposed of in Beg. v. Yeadon ([86]) was respecting the verdict.\nAmong the cases in which the question reserved related to the sentence it will be sufficient to note Reg.v. Summers ([87]), in which case the sentence was held to be correct * Reg. v. Willis ([88]) in 1872 where the sentence was amended by reducing the term of imprisonment from seven years to five; Beg. v. Denne([89]), in 1877, in which the sentence was left undisturbed * and Reg. v. Horn ([90]) in 1883 where the court amended the sentence.\nIn Ontario the courts have acted on the principle which I have quoted from the language of Lord Cran worth when Baron Rolfe.\nIn Beg. v. Patteson ([91]) the question reserved was respecting the right of the crown to cause jurors to stand aside at the trial of an indictment for libel and the conviction was annulled on the ground that the right accorded to the crown at the trial was not well founded.\nIn Beg. v. Smith ([92]) there was an objection to the constitution of the jury. The judge reserved the question at the request of the prisoner after the close of the assize. It was held to be properly reserved.\nIn Beg. v. Kerr ([93]) a question was reserved and decided, touching the right to have a special jury. I am not sufficiently familiar with the jurisprudence of the other provinces to venture to say what its course has been in this matter, but if the jurisprudence of Quebec is correctly stated by Mr. Justice Ramsay in Reg. v. Feote ([94]) as I assume it to be, it is to give the fullest possible scope to the provisions of section 259.\nNo question was reserved in this case, and it must, I think be held as was held in the court below, that the mere fact that the judge did not reserve a case, is not tantamount to his refusing to reserve one. The refusal must be in answer to a request. The legislature would doubtless have used language of more direct force, or have employed some such term as \"fail,\" or \"omit,\" or \" neglect,\" if it was intended that a writ of error should always be allowable whenever no case was reserved.\nThese are the grounds on which I am of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed. I believe my views are substantially the same as those expressed by my brother Strong on one branch of the case of Brisbois v. The Queen ([95]) which was argued shortly before I became a member of the court, and held also in that case by my brother Fournier.\nThose views were not concurred in by the other members of the court who considered that the circum stance that the objection to the constitution of the jury which was the subject of the case reserved, was not suggested until after the conviction took it out of the statute as a question of law arising on the trial. That opinion does not directly meet the present case, in which the point taken is that the objection arose before the trial and not on the trial. But the decision in Brisbois' case did not rest on the one ground that the question had not arisen on the trial. It proceeded also upon another ground, which was, by itself, quite sufficient to sustain the judgment of the court, namely, that the jurisdiction was excluded by section 246 of the act. The point was thus concisely put by my brother Taschereau :\nThis section, in express terms, enacts that judgment shall not be stayed or reversed because any person has served upon the jury who was not returned as a juror by the sheriff. Now here, the only irregularity complained of is that Moise Lamoureux has served upon the jury, though not returned as a juror by the sheriff.\nIt is plain, to my mind,that my opinion in this case is not in conflict with the judgment of the court in Brisbois' case. Other grounds which distinguish that case from the present have now been noticed by my brothers Taschereau and Gwynne.\nReverting to Mellor's case, it may be worth noting that of the fourteen judges seven held that the statute authorised the reservation of the case and that there had been a mistrial. The other seven were not un animous on the question whether upon the facts of that case, which differed materially from those now before us, there had been a mistrial but they all agreed that the court had not jurisdiction to entertain the case. I have already referred to the position taken by Williams J, The other six based their opinion on a different line of argument, the strong point of which was that the statute while it authorised the court to reverse confirm or amend the judgment. gave no power to order a new trial or a venire de novo. The argument is elaborated in the judgments of Pollock C. B. Erle J. and Channel B.; Crompton J. expressed his concurrence and Crowder and Willis JJ., who had doubts on the subject, inclined to the same view. The answer given to this argument by Coleridge J. seems to have been that the court could declare the trial a nullity and that without any formal award of a new trial the prisoner must necessarily be tried again. Other judges considered that the power given by the statute to \" make such other order as justice may require authorised the order for a new trial. Our legislation leaves no room for the question. The act of 1869 ([96]), provided in section 80, while repealing some provincial enactments which had authorised new trials, and declaring that no writ of error should be allowed in any criminal case unless founded on some question of law which could not have been reserved or which the judge presiding at the trial refused to reserve for the consideration of the court having jurisdiction in such cases, that nothing in that section should be construed to pre vent the subsequent trial of the offender for the same offence in any case where the conviction should be declared bad for any cause which made the former trial a nullity so that there was no lawful trial in the case. This provision took a somewhat more distinct form in section 268 of the Criminal Procedure Act ([97]), which declared that :\nA new trial shall not be granted in any criminal case unless the conviction is declared bad for a cause which makes the former trial a nullity so that there was no lawful trial in the case.\nThis enactment retains the same form in the act of 50511 Vic. ch. 50 which amends section 268.\nIt may be safely assumed that if there had been legislation of this character in England in 1858, the opinions of the Chief Baron and the judges who took his view of the venire de novo question would have coincided with that of the seven judges who held that the statute covered the case. Indeed that opinion was very soon recognised as the undisputed rule of construction to be applied to the statute as we find from Reg. v. Yeadon ([98]) in which case a venire de novo was ordered in 1861, by a court composed of five judges, all of whom had taken part in Mellor's case Pollock C.B. delivering the judgment of the court, and the other judges, including Channel B. and Williams J. concurring.\nThe language of our section 259 being the same which, as found in the English Act, had received this definite construction, it would be proper to hold if necessary to resort to that principle, that our parliament had adopted the language in view of the construction it had received.\nI am of opinion that we should dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nAttorney for prisoner: F.

Fournier and Taschereau JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, Manitoba, affirming the judgment of Dubuc J. at the hearing in favor of the plaintiff.\nThe original proceedings in this case were taken by the plaintiff against the defendant Drummond on a mortgage made by the latter for a sale of the mortgaged premises and a personal order against said defendant for payment of the amount secured. The defendant by his answer to the bill of complaint averred that at the time of the negotiation of the loan, it was distinctly understood and agreed between him and the plaintiff, that he was not to become personally responsible for the payment of the mortgage money, and he prayed for a reformation of the mortgage so as to make same conform with the intention of the parties. He also set up that he was simply trustee for the members of a syndicate who were owners of the land mortgaged, and submitted that they were necessary parties to the suit. The plaintiff thereupon amended his bill with the evident intention of making the members of the syndicate or those representing them parties. By this amendment the appellants became defendants in the suit.\nIt appeared that after the syndicate purchased the land and appointed Drummond their trustee a mortgage was given to secure the payment of the purchase money, and a bond of indemnity was given by a number of the members of the syndicate to Drummond, and the amended bill charges that the members of the syndicate agreed with the trustee to share with him the responsibility of and incident to the purchase of the lands in question, and the execution of mortgages for $11,700 given or assumed for the balance of purchase money thereon, and that such last mentioned mortgages having become overdue, the trustee borrowed from the plaintiff $12,500 to pay same off, and gave as security the mortgage upon which the bill herein is filed. The bill prays that the members of the syndicate may be ordered to contribute to the payment of the said mortgage moneys for which the said trustee is liable, \u201cas the said Charles S. Drummond may be entitled to require and to this honourable court shall seem proper.\u201d\nThe amended bill further charges that for the better securing of the payment of the mortgage money thirteen members of the syndicate executed a bond in favor of the plaintiff, whereby each of them bound himself to pay the plaintiff $390 for each and every undivided share to which they were entitled in said lands, and prays that the said members so signing may be ordered to forthwith pay to the plaintiff the moneys so covenanted to be paid by them.\nThis bond is not taken into account in the following judgments as its execution by the appellants was not proved.\nThe cause was heard before Mr. Justice Dubuc, who found that the defendant, Drummond, was not entitled to a reformation of the mortgage, and that the plaintiff could properly claim the personal security of the other defendants in payment of this mortgage. On a re-hearing before Chief Justice Taylor and Mr. Justice Dubuc, the other two judges having been concerned in the cause while at the bar, the Chief Justice dissented from the decision at the hearing but Mr. Justice Dubuc adhering to his opinion his decision was affirmed. An appeal was then taken to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nS. H. Blake Q. C. and Wilson for the appellants referred to Nichols v. Watson ([1]); Clarkson v. Scott ([2]); Real Estate Loan Company v. Molesworth ([3]); Gandy v. Gandy ([4]). McCarthy Q. C. and Howell Q. C. for the respondents cited Wenloch v. River Dee Co. ([5]); Blackburn Benefit Building Society v. Cunliffe ([6]).\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014If the plaintiff cannot get at his right without trying and deciding a case between co-defendants the court will try and decide that case, and the co-defendants will be bound, but if the relief given to the plaintiff does not require or involve a decision of any case between co-defendants the co-defendants will not be bound as between each other, by any proceeding which may be necessary only to the decree the plaintiff obtains. Cottingham v. Earl of Shrewsbury ([7]).\nThere is no ground whatever shewn for reforming the mortgage. The plaintiff in this case lent his money on the security of the land, the. personal security of the mortgagor, and the bond of the mortgagor and Ross, and not on the security of the parties for whose benefit the mortgagor held the property and therefore has no claim he can enforce against these latter parties, notwithstanding any claim the mortgagor may have against them should the property prove insufficient to meet the amount of the mortgage and interest. \u201cThe liability arises from the instrument only, and the extent of the obligation must be measured by the terms of the instrument only.\u201d Per Baggallay J. A. in Berresford v. Browning ([8]).\nSTRONG J.\u2014In the early part of the year 1882 there were great speculations in real estate in the City of Winnipeg. Persons from, all parts of Canada went there for the purpose of engaging in the purchase and sale of lands, among others the three appellants, Williams, who lived in Welland, Ontario; Vanwart, who lived in Fredericton, New Brunswick; and Slaven, who lived in Napanee, Ontario. These three and a number of others met together in February 1882, and formed themselves into a syndicate to purchase a large block of land fronting on the Assiniboine River in the residence portion of Winnipeg, with a view of laying the same out into 60 building lots, and offering them for sale at once. They purchased the block for $30,000 and paid $18,300 in cash, the balance $11,700 was to remain on mortgage bearing interest at 8 per cent per annum and payable one half in six months and the remainder in twelve months. Prior to the completion of the formation of the syndicate Williams and Slay en returned to their respective homes and shortly after such completion Van wart left for Fredericton.\nThe respondent C. S. Drummond was appointed trustee for the syndicate and a conveyance of the land was made to him and he assumed a mortgage then existing upon the land in favor of one Wilson for $5,500 and executed a mortgage for $4,000 to A. W. Ross, the vendor of one portion of the property, and another to his brother H. M. Drummond, the vendor of the remainder, for $3,500, making in all $13,000.\nThe day before he executed the two mortgages last referred to the trustee had obtained from a number of the members of this syndicate a bond of indemnity which recited that he had executed a mortgage on behalf of the syndicate upon the lands purchased for the sum of $11,700 to secure the balance of purchase money thereon.\nThis bond was ostensibly executed by Vanwart by attorney, but the learned judge at the hearing, Mr. Justice Dubuc, found that it was not proved to have been executed by Slaven and Williams.\nThe intention of the members of the syndicate was that the property should be sold at once, and the proceeds applied first in payment of the expenses connected with the sale, and the trustee\u2019s commission, and then in discharge of the mortgage for $11,700, and the balance was to be distributed among the members of the syndicate. This appears from the declaration of trust given by the trustee to Vanwart. It appears, however, by the evidence of Mr. Vass, the trustee\u2019s book-keeper who had charge of the matter, that the first proceeding to his knowledge taken to obtain a sale of the property was about the 18th November, 1882.\nThe first instalment of the mortgage given to Ross and H. M. Drummond fell due without the trustee having realized anything to meet the same. An arrangement was then come to with an agent of the plaintiff to make the loan to secure which the mortgage which is the subject of the present suit was given.\nConsiderable delay took place in completing the loan owing to the trustee declining to alter the mortgage as executed so as to make himself personally liable, both mortgagor and mortgagee being under the impression that as executed the trustee incurred no personal liability thereunder, but certain bonds having been obtained to make up for this the matter was finally concluded and the money advanced by the plaintiff.\nThe bill as originally framed was for a sale of the mortgaged premises, and for a personal order against the trustee for payment. The trustee answered that at the time of the negotiation of the loan it was distinctly understood and agreed between him and the plaintiff that he was not to become personally responsible for the payment of the mortgage money, and he prayed for a reformation of the mortgage so as to make the same conform to the intention of the parties. He also set up that he was simply trustee for the members of the syndicate, and submitted that they were necessary parties to the suit. The plaintiff thereupon amended his bill and made the members of the syndicate or those representing them parties to the suit.\nThe amended bill further charged that the members of the syndicate agreed with the trustee to share with him the responsibility of and incidental to the purchase of the lands in question, and of the execution of the mortgages for $11,700 given or assumed for the balance of purchase money thereon, and that such last mentioned mortgages having become overdue, the trustee, in November, 1882, borrowed from the plaintiff $12,500 to pay the same off and gave as security the mortgage upon which the bill in this suit is filed. The bill as to the members of the syndicate prays that they may be ordered to contribute to the payment of the mortgage moneys for which the trustee is liable.\nThe amended bill further charged that for the better securing of the payment of the mortgage money thirteen members of the syndicate executed a bond in favor of the plaintiff, whereby each of them bound himself to pay the plaintiff $390 for each and every undivided share to which they were entitled in the lands, and prayed that the members so signing might be ordered forthwith to pay to the plaintiff the moneys so covenanted to be paid by them.\nAs neither of the appellants Williams or Slaven signed this bond its existence does not affect them. As to the appellant Vanwart, he not only did not sign the bond but never heard of it until after the commencement of this suit. One Deacon purported to sign the bond for him but, for the reasons set forth in the judgment of Taylor C. J., he had no authority so to do, and same was not binding upon Vanwart. So far, therefore, as the appellants are concerned this bond may be left out of consideration.\nThe cause came on for hearing before Mr. Justice Dubuc. The decree made by him directs a sale of the mortgaged premises, and that in case the proceeds, after deducting the plaintiff\u2019s costs, be insufficient to pay the amount due upon the plaintiffs mortgage all the defendants except Moles worth and Cruthers should severally contribute towards payment to the plaintiff of such deficiency in proportion to their respective shares according to the syndicate agreement of the schedule thereto annexed.\nThe bill was dismissed with costs as against Molesworth, who was a party to both of the agreements.\nThe three appellants caused the decree to be reheard before the court in banc, consisting of Chief Justice Taylor and Mr. Justice Dubuc, the latter learned judge being obliged to sit owing to the two remaining judges of the court having been engaged in the case while at the bar. The Chief Justice pronounced a judgment in favor of the present appellant, but as Mr. Justice Dubuc adhered to his original judgment the court was equally divided and the rehearing was dismissed with costs. From this last judgment the appellants now appeal.\nThe learned Chief Justice of Manitoba has written a very full judgment in this case, and I so entirely agree with him that I do not feel called upon to do more than deal very briefly with the principal points which have been the subject of debate both, here and in the court below.\nThere is no direct privity of contract between the respondent Balfour and the appellants. The appellants, Williams and Slaven did not execute the indemnity agreement and, of course, were not liable upon it in any way; and, as the Chief Justice of Manitoba, has shewn, Vanwart is in exactly the same position, Deacon who assumed to execute it in his name having no authority whatever to do so. This being the state of facts I know of no principle which entitles the mortgagee to a personal decree against them. No case directly in point has been cited and the cases referred to are contradictory, and such of them as the plaintiff relies upon are of very doubtful authority, so much so that before I acted upon them I should require much stronger reasons for the practice they sanction than any I have heard advanced in argument or found stated in any reported decision. The weight of authority in Ontario is altogether against such an order; the case of Campbell v. Robinson ([9]), as Chief Justice Taylor has pointed out, is clearly distinguishable, the personal order there made being for the benefit of the mortgagor who had become a mere surety for the purchasers of the equity of redemption, and was, therefore, considered on that distinct ground entitled to indemnity from them. I should not, however, be inclined to follow even that case, as I do not see how the question could, on the pleadings, have been properly raised between the co-defendants. The liability of a party defendant to a foreclosure suit to have a personal order made against him by the Court of Equity is to be ascertained by an inquiry as to what his liability would have been in a common law action before, by statute or by general orders made under statutory authority, jurisdiction to entertain the legal personal remedy was conferred on the equity court, the object of such statutes and orders having been merely to avoid circuity and multiplicity of suits, and not in any way to enlarge the liabilities of the mortgagor or owner of the equity of redemption.\nSuch cases as Campbell v. Robinson do not, however, apply at all. What the plaintiff seeks is to be placed in the position of Drummond, the trustee, as regards his right to indemnity from his cestuis que trust No authority is produced warranting such relief. But be that as it may, it appears that Drummond having deliberately taken an express formal indemnity from the other members of the syndicate in the shape of the covenant to which the appellants were not parties, he has thereby shown his intention to rely on that express indemnity, and is therefore restricted to it; see Mathew v. Blackmore ([10]). Therefore, even if we were to put the plaintiff in Drummond\u2019s shoes, that would not entitle him to a personal order against the appellants. Moreover, as Chief Justice Taylor has demonstrated, such an order as is sought here, giving a third party the benefit of equities and rights, arising either under express contract or upon equitable principles, entitling a trustee to indemnity from his cestui que trust, would be not only unsupported by authority but in direct opposition to numerous authorities, both at law and in equity, establishing that a third person is not entitled to enforce such rights and equities even in the very plain case of a covenant entered into between two to pay money into the hands of such third person, or to do some other act for his benefit. Colyear v. Lady Mulgrave (1). In the United States it may, as regards some of the States, be different for the doctrine that a stranger to the covenant, or to the consideration, cannot sue does not prevail there except in a few States, and the courts of the State of New York especially hold a contrary doctrine.\nAs regards the right of Drummond to enforce any equitable claim for relief against his co-defendants the present appellants, independently of the ground for refusing such relief already adverted to, (namely that by taking the express covenant he impliedly relinquished all claims upon the other cestuis que trust) it is very clear that he could have no such relief in this suit, in which the appellants have had no apportunity to answer his demand, and in which no issue has been raised as between them and Drummond.\nFor these reasons, I am of opinion that we have no alternative but to allow this appeal with costs. The appellants are also entitled to the costs of the court below on the re-hearing as well as on the original hearing.\nThe case for reformation of the mortgage on the ground of mistake set up by Drummond requires no observations; it entirely fails on the evidence, as the Chief Justice in his judgment in the court below has conclusively shown.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREATJ J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal and hold the appellants personally liable on the grounds taken by Mr. Justice Dubuc in the court below.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014Concurred in the judgments allowing the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellants: Aikens, Culver & Co.\nSolicitors for respondent Balfour: Vivian & Dodge.\nSolicitors for respondent Drummond: Hough & Campbell.\n[1] 23 Gr. 606.\n[2] 25 Gr. 373.\n[3] 3 Man.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Taschereau, Gwynne, and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nLandlord and tenant\u2014Creation of tenancy by mortgage\u2014Demise to Mortgagor\u2014Construction of\u2014Rent reserved\u2014Intention to create tenancy.\nA mortgage of real estate provided that the money secured thereby, $20,000, should be payable with interest at 7 per cent. per annum as follows: $500 on December 1st, 1883; $500 on the first days of June and December in each of the four following years; and $15,500 on June 1st, 1888; and it contained the following provision: \u201cAnd the mortgagees lease to the mortgagor the said lands from the date hereof until the date herein provided for the last payment of any of the moneys hereby secured, undisturbed by the mortgagees or their assigns, he, the mortgagor, paying therefor in every year during the said term, on each and every of the days in the above proviso for redemption appointed for payment of the moneys hereby secured, such rent or sum as equals in amount the amount payable on such days respectively according to the said proviso, without any deduction. And it is agreed that such payments when so made shall respectively be taken, and be in all respects in satisfaction of the moneys so then payable according to the said proviso.\u201d The mortgage did not contain the statutory distress clause, or clause providing for possession by the mortgagor until default and it was not executed by the mortgagees. The mortgagor was in possession of part of the premises and his tenants of the remainder and such possession continued after the mortgage was executed. The goods of the mortgagor having been seized under execution the mortgagee claimed payment of a year\u2019s rent under the Statute of Anne.\nHeld, per Strong, Gwynne and Patterson JJ. (Ritchie C.J. and Taschereau J. dissenting,) the mortgage deed failed to create between the mortgagor and mortgagees the relation of landlord and tenant, so as to give the mortgagees the right to distrain for arrears of rent, under the provisions of 8 Anne c. 14, as against an execution creditor of the mortgagor; because, even if the deed could operate as a lease although not signed by the mortgagees, the rent reserved was so unreasonable and excessive as to show conclusively that the parties could not have intended to create a tenancy and that the arrangement was unreal and fictitious.\nThe right to impugn the validity of a lease between a mortgagor and mortgagees on the ground that it is merely fictitious and colorable is not to be confined to any particular class such as assignees in bankruptcy, but may be exercised wherever the interests of third parties may be involved.\nPer Strong J. The excution of the deed by the mortgagor estopped him from disputing the tenancy, and the mortgagees were also estopped by their acceptance of the mortgagor as their tenant, evidenced by their accepting the deed, advancing their money upon the faith of it and permitting the mortgagor to remain in possession.\nThe mortgage deed, although executed by the mortgagor only, operated in any event to create a tenancy at will, at the same rental as that expressly reserved by the demise clause. Sec. 3 of 8 & 9 Vic. c. 106, (R.S.O. c. 100, sec. 8,) has not the effect of repealing the words of the statute of frauds which make the lease required by that statute to be in writing signed by the lessor so far effectual as to create a tenancy at will.\nPer Gwynne and Patterson JJ. The mortgage deed not having been signed by the mortgagees failed to create even a tenancy at will.\nPer Gwynne J. The form adopted for the demise clause is such that by the mortgagees executing the deed it would operate as a lease, and by their not executing it the clause would be simply inoperative.\nPer Ritchie C.J. and Taschereau J. The execution of the mortgage by the mortgagor and continuing in possession under it amonnted to an attornment and the relation of landlord and tenant was created. The deed was intended to operate as an immediate lease with intent to give the mortgagees an additional remedy by distress and was a bon\u00e2 fide contract for securing the payment of principal and interest, and in the absence of any bankruptcy or insolvency laws there was nothing to prevent the parties from making such a contract.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division[2] in favor of the defendants.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently set out in the head-note and in the following judgments of the court. At the trial judgment was given for the plaintiffs, then learned judge holding that while the rent would be unreasonably excessive if the tenancy was treated as for the whole term of five years, yet that the term was divisible and there was a good lease for four and a\u2011half years at $1,000 a year. The Divisional Court reversed this decision and held that no real tenancy was created. The Court of Appeal, in turn, reversed the decision of the Divisional Court and held in favor of the tenancy. The defendants appealed to this court.\nGibbons for the appellants cited Trust and Loan Co. v. Lawrason[3]; Ex parte Voisey[4]; Ex parte Jackson[5].\nMoss Q.C. for respondents referred to Ex parte Punnett[6]; Alton v. Harrison[7].\nSIR W.J. RITCHIE, C.J.\u2014I think there is nothing in this case to lead one to doubt the bon\u00e2 fides of this transaction, or to lead to the conclusion that as a matter of fact the partners did not intend to create the relationship of landlord and tenant; the mortgagor was, at the time of the execution of this mortgage, in perfectly solvent circumstances, and the mortgagee advanced his money by way of loan on the security of this mortgage and the provisions contained therein. The mortgagor was the owner of this land in fee and he conveyed it by way of mortgage to the mortgagee. I cannot understand why the redemise clause cannot be treated as a lease, or as creating a tenancy. The mortgagee was at law the owner of the land in fee, what then prevented him from making a lease for the term mentioned in the mortgage?\nI think the payments made must be taken to have been made as rent payable in accordance with the terms of the mortgage. Why should this clause be eliminated from the mortgage, what right have we to say that the mortgagee would have advanced his money without the security of this clause, and does not this very litigation show that such a relationship was for the better securing the payment of the mortgage money?\nWhat right have we to say, contrary to the express language of the redemise clause, that that was a provision merely that the mortgagor shall remain in possession until default? Why, if that was the intention, was it not so treated and plainly expressed? Why should we be called on to say that the parties intended that the contract should be different from that expressed in the deed by which his right to remain in possession rests on the express demise creating the relation of landlord and tenant?\nI think that after the execution of the mortgage and continuing in possession under the mortgage amounted to an attornment and the relation of landlord and tenant was created.\nI think the deed was intended to operate as an immediate lease with intent to give the mortgagee an additional remedy by distress.\nThere was no bankruptcy law in existence when this deed was excuted. In the absence of any bankrupt or insolvent laws, what was to prevent the parties making this contract? What right have we to say it does not express the true bargain and that a tenancy was not created which the parties expressly say shall be created? The mortgagor agrees that a tenancy shall exist on the terms mentioned in the mortgage and this deed is delivered to the mortgagees who accept and assent to it, and the mortgagor pays rent under it. What more perfect attornment could there be? What stronger language could be used to show that a tenancy was created and the mortgagor assumed the position of tenant at the rent specified.\nI think there is no ground for saying that this was a mere device for evading the bankruptcy or insolvent laws, in fact it could not be, for there were no bankrupt or insolvent laws to evade nor to defraud or interfere with any others, and therefore the rent reserved, even if out of proportion to the annual value, is no objection to the demise.\nI think the contract in this case was a bon\u00e2 fide contract a reality and no sham by which the relation of landlord and tenant was established for securing the payment of principal and interest on the mortgage security. I will only cite one authority which I consider conclusive; other cases bearing on this question have been so fully discussed in the court below that I do not deem it necessary to refer to them, all of which, in my opinion, fully justify the decision at which the Court of Appeal have arrived. It is the case of Ex parte Voisey[8].\nJessel, M.R. says:\nBut some other points have been taken. It was said that there was no tenancy at all, because you cannot make a tenancy except by agreement, and that, as the mortgage deed was not executed by the mortgagees, there is no agreement. The fallacy of that argument appears to me to be in confounding agreement with evidence of agreement. Certainly there must be an agreement, or else you cannot have a tenancy, but an attornment may be evidence that the landlord has entered into an agreement for a tenancy. In this case we have an attornment to the legal owner by deed executed by the tenant in possession and delivered to the legal owner\u2014very good evidence of a tenancy\u2014evidence, therefore, of an agreement for a tenancy, and as was said in Ex parte Punnett[9] that is an estoppel in pais which would prevent the tenant from denying the tenancy. Therefore, there is in this case a well created tenancy.\nPage 457. Brett J. says:\nNow the stipulation which is called an attornment, if it be a bon\u00e2 fide and honest transaction, is a contract in writing between the two parties to it. It is signed by only one of them, if you please, but it is delivered by that person to the other, and kept by him, and the intention of it is that it shall form a contract and, if that be so, it is a contract. If it is a contract, it is a contract in writing, and if it be a bon\u00e2 fide contract, and is in writing, the effect of it depends entirely upon the construction of the writing.\nAnd at page 459:\nThat raises the question whether the contract was a bon\u00e2 fide one. Now, in what sense can it be said that it is not bon\u00e2 fide? Whatever may be its terms, and however excessive the rent, it is not a fraud as between the parties, because nothing was concealed by the one from the other, and both agreed to the terms. Therefore it could not be a fraud as between the parties. It was not intended to defraud any known individual. It cannot, therefore, in the ordinary sense of the term, be a fraud at all. The only way in which it can cease to be a bon\u00e2 fide contract is if it was not intended to be acted upon between the parties at all, and was only a device to evade the bankruptcy laws. That would not be what is ordinarily called a fraud, but it would be what is called a fraud upon the bankruptcy laws, that is, an attempt to evade the bankruptcy laws in case of a bankruptcy. Now that attempted evasion, that want of bon\u00e2 fides with regard to the bankruptcy law, must exist, if at all, at the moment when the contract is made. Therefore what we have to consider is this (and this is the real meaning of Ex parte Williams[10] at the time when the contract was made it was made for the purpose of its being acted upon between the parties, whether there should be a bankruptcy or not, or, although in terms it appears to be made between the parties with the intention that it should be acted upon whether there is a bankruptcy or not, were their minds really then fixed upon this, that it was to be acted upon only if there should be a bankruptcy? In other words, they must have had bankruptcy in their contemplation at the time of making the contract, they must have contemplated evading or attempting to evade the fair distribution of the mortgagor\u2019s property in case of his bankruptcy. That seems to me to be the true proposition and the true principle of the law which is laid down Ex parte Williams10.\nAnd at page 461 he says:\nI take it that the question is whether there was a real honest stipulation between the parties, intended to be acted upon whether there should be a bankruptcy or not, or whether it was a stipulation which they intended to be acted upon only for the purpose of defeating the bankruptcy law.\nCotton J. at page 464 says:\nOf course the question is, was the transaction a sham or a reality? and I think we ought in the present case to take it to be a reality and not a sham. And, if we come to this conclusion, there being nothing to prevent a mortgagee and a mortgagor from agreeing together that the relation of landlord and tenant shall exist between them, we cannot deprive the mortgagee of the consequences resulting from the legal relation which has been honestly and really constituted by the contract between the parties.\nJessel, M.R. at page 465, says:\nI wish to add that I entirely agree in the observations of Lord Justice Brett, as to the principles of law which are te extracted from Ex parte Williams[11] and the two subsequent cases.\nI think, therefore, that the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This was an interpleader issue. The appellants who were the defendants in the issue were execution creditors of David Darvill and under their executions certain goods and chattels, the property of the execution debtor, were seized by the sheriff of Middlesex. These goods were, at the time of the seizure, upon certain lands and premises of the execution debtor which had previously been mortgaged by him to the respondents. The respondents insisted that under the terms of this mortgage the relation of landlord and tenant had been created between themselves and the mortgagor, and that a rent equal to the instalments of principal and interest of the mortgage debt, which the mortgagor had covenanted to pay, had been duly created, and they claimed that the sheriff should not remove the goods seized by him from the mortgaged premises until certain arrears of the rent mentioned should be paid to them, pursuant to statute 8 Anne ch. 14.\nThe mortgage was to secure the repayment of a loan of $20,000 and interest, and was, by indenture dated the 31st May, 1883, the parties to the deed being David Darvill the mortgagor, and the present respondents the mortgagees. It contained the following proviso for defeasance, viz.:\nProvided, this mortgage to be void on payment of twenty thousand dollars of gold coin of legal tender in Canada, or at the option of the mortgagees or their assigns, the then equivalent thereof of lawful money of Canada, with interest of seven per cent. per annum as follows:\u2014Five hundred dollars of the said principal sum to be paid on the first of December next (1883); five hundred dollars on the first day of each of the months of June and December in each of the four following years: 1884, 1885, 1886 and 1887, and fifteen thousand five hundred dollars, being the balance of the said principal sum, on the first day of June, in the year eighteen hundred and eighty-eight. And the interest at the rate aforesaid, likewise of gold coin or its equivalent as aforesaid, on the unpaid principal from the first day of the month of June, 1883, to be paid semi-annually on the first day of each of the months of June and December, in each year, until the said principal sum and interest shall be fully paid and satisfied. The first of said semi-annually payments of interest to become payable on the first day of December, in the year eighteen hundred and eighty-three.\nThere was also a power to take possession and sell in case of default in payment conferred by the following words:\nProvided, that the said mortgagees, on default of payment for one month may, on one month\u2019s notice, enter on and lease or sell the said lands. Provided also that any such sale may be for cash or on terms of credit, and that in case of default of payment as in foregoing proviso mentioned, for three months, the foregoing powers of entry, leasing and sale, or any of them may be exercised without any notice having been given as therein provided.\nAnd there was also in the deed the following clause purporting to be a demise of the mortgaged property by the mortgagees to the mortgagor:\nAnd the mortgagees lease to the mortgagor the said lands from the date hereof until the date herein provided for the last payment of any of the moneys hereby secured, undisturbed by the mortgagees or their assigns, he, the mortgagor, paying therefor in every year during the said term, on each and every of the days in the above proviso for redemption appointed for payment of the moneys hereby secured, such rent or sum as equals in amount, the amount payable on such days respectively, according to the said proviso without any deduction. And it is agreed that such payments when so made shall respectively be taken and be in all respects in satisfaction of the moneys so then payable according to the said proviso. Provided always, and it is agreed that in case any of the covenants or agreements herein of the mortgagor, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, be untrue, or be unobserved or broken at any time, the mortgagees, their successors or assigns, may without any previous demand or notice enter on the said lands or any part thereof, in the name of the whole, and take and retain possession thereof, and determine the said lease. And no reconveyance, release or discharge from these presents, of any part or parts of the said lands by the mortgagees or their assigns shall cause an apportionment of the said rent, but the whole thereof shall be payable out of the remainder of the said lands.\nThe mortgage deed was duly executed by the mortgagor but not by the mortgagees. The sheriff having seized the goods of the mortgagor found upon the mortgaged premises under the execution of the appellants, the respondents on the 8th June, 1887, served him with a notice that there was due to them for rent reserved in respect of the tenancy alleged to have been created by the mortgage, the aggregate amount of $3,180, being composed of the three payments which had fallen due in June and December, 1886, and in June, 1887, and they required the sheriff not to remove the goods until they were paid. The appellants disputed this claim. Thereupon the sheriff obtained the interpleader order, whereby it was directed that an issue should be tried to ascertain the rights of the respective parties. An issue was accordingly framed in which the present respondents were plaintiffs and the appellants defendants; whereby the question to be determined was stated to be whether the respondents were entitled as landlords of David Darvill or otherwise under the mortgage from said David Darvill to the plaintiffs dated the thirty-first day of May, A.D. 1883, to be paid out of the moneys realized on the sale of the goods and chattels of said David Darvill, seized on the first day of June, A.D. 1887, in execution by the sheriff of the county of Middlesex, the sum of $1,077.50 and $1,060.00 due to the plaintiffs for arrears of rent or otherwise under said mortgage, and payable on the first day of June, 1886, and the first day of December, 1886, respectively, in respect of the lands upon which the said goods and chattels were at the time of the seizure and sale thereof, or some part thereof, as against the execution creditors.\nThis issue came on to be tried at the Middlesex assizes before Mr. Justice Rose and a jury, when the learned judge having discharged the jury reserved the case for further consideration and subsequently found the issue in favour of the present respondents and entered judgment for them accordingly. Upon motion to the Divisional Court of Queen\u2019s Bench this judgment was set aside and judgment was ordered to be entered in favour of the appellants. The respondents then appealed to the Court of Appeal by which court the order of the Divisional Court was reversed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Rose restored. The judgments in the Divisional Court and in the Court of Appeal were respectively concurred in by all the learned judges who took part in those decisions.\nIt is well settled by authority that it is competent for the parties to a mortgage of real property to agree that in addition to their principal relation as mortgagor and mortgagee they shall also as regards the mortgaged lands stand towards each other in the relation of landlord and tenant, the mortgagor thus remaining in possession as the tenant of the mortgagee. It is, however, essential to the validity of such an arrangement that it should be so carried out as to comply with the requirements of the law prescribed for the creation of leases, and further that it should appear that it was really the intention of the parties to create a tenancy at the rental (if any) which may be reserved and not merely under colour and pretence of a lease to give the mortgagee additional security not incidental to his character of mortgagee. If these conditions are complied with the relation of lessor and lessee is considered to be established not merely as between the parties themselves but in respect of third persons also. In such a case it has been held that the mortgagee may distrain for rent in arrear upon the goods of a stranger found upon the mortgaged or demised lands, and it also follows that in a case like the present, he is entitled to insist as against the sheriff and the execution creditors of the mortgagor upon the rights conferred on landlords by the statute 8 Anne ch. 14 and claimed by the respondents in the present instance. It is somewhat remarkable that the right of the mortgagee to distrain the goods of a stranger does not appear to have been finally determined by judicial authority in England until a date so recent as 1883, when in the case of Kearsley v. Philips[12], it was so decided by the Court of Appeal. Previously, however, to the date of this decision in Kearsley v. Philips the courts of Ontario had in many cases recognized this right of distress and it may now be regarded as well established, subject however, to the conditions already mentioned.\nThe questions we have to deal with in the present case are two, namely,1st, was the mortgage deed, having regard to the fact that it was executed by the mortgagor only and not by the mortgagees, sufficient to create any tenancy at all between the parties at the rent assumed to be reserved by its terms, three gales of which are claimed by the mortgagees by the notice served on the sheriff; and 2ndly if the instrument was itself sufficient does it appear to have been the real intention of the parties, in good faith, to constitute between themselves the relation of landlord and tenant and that at a real rental or was the arrangement not real but merely a fiction or sham entered into for no other purpose than to obtain for the mortgagees an additional security similar to that which a landlord would have by means of the common law right of distress upon such goods as might be found upon the premises. Upon the first question I am of opinion that the mortgage executed as it was was sufficient to create a tenancy. In support of their position under this head the respondents have relied principally upon two cases, Morton v. Woods[13] and the same case in the Exchequer Chamber[14] and West v. Fritche[15]. It appears to me, however, that neither of these cases exactly covers the question arising here, though the judgments delivered in Morton v. Woods do I think contain the enunciation of principles which greatly assist in deciding the point now under consideration. In Morton v. Woods the clause of the mortgage which was relied on as creating the tenancy was in its terms different from that in the instrument before us; it was in form an attornment clause, by which the mortgagor declared that he attorned to and became tenant to the mortgagees; in the present case the clause (before stated) is in terms a demise by the mortgagee to the mortgagor. It seems, however, that this is an immaterial difference; in this case as in the case of the attornment clause there is an admission under seal by the mortgagor of the terms of the demise and by force of the words \u201cyielding and paying therefor\u201d a covenant to pay the rent. This coupled with the facts that the mortgagees advanced their money on the faith of all the provisions contained in the deed and that the mortgagor was allowed to remain in possession after the execution of the mortgage and as it must be assumed under the provision in question would it seems to me amount to an estoppel binding the mortgagor as well as the mortgagee, and which would therefore be sufficient to constitute a tenancy unaffected by the provisions contained in the statute of frauds and in the eighth section of the revised statutes of Ontario, 1887 ch. 100 (a re-enactment of the Imperial Act 8 & 9 Vic. ch. 106 sec. 3). These enactments require that when a lease for more than three years depends on the conventional acts of the parties it must be evidenced by a deed; but this in no way interferes with the doctrine of estoppel which proceeds upon the principle not that there is sufficient legal evidence of a demise but that the parties are by their acts debarred from disputing that fact. Therefore I should, if there were no other grounds for so determining, be prepared to hold that the mortgagor\u2019s execution of the deed estopped him from disputing the tenancy and that the mortgagee was also estopped by his acceptance of the mortgagor as his tenant evidenced by his accepting the deed, advancing his money upon the faith of it and permitting the mortgagor to remain in possession. This conclusion would, I think, be fully supported by the case of West v. Fritche15.\nIn Morton v. Woods it was not necessary to have recourse to the doctrine of estoppel for the purpose of establishing that there was a demise, though it was resorted to in order to get over another difficulty there arising, that from the circumstance of there having been a prior outstanding mortgage there was no legal reversion in the mortgagor.\nThe objection founded upon the requirements of the statute making a deed essential to the creation of a tenancy for more than three years was got over in a different way. It was there held that inasmuch as it appeared that upon the true construction of the attornment clause the parties did not intend to create a tenancy for a term but a mere tenancy at will, the statutes did not apply; and that all that was requisite for the creation of such tenancy at will was some evidence even by parol to that effect. Further, that there had been an actual present demise by the mortgagee to hold at the will of the latter and that this was to be implied from the execution by the mortgagor of the mortgage deed containing the attornment clause, and from the assent to its terms by the mortgagee to be inferred from his acts in advancing the money on the faith of the deed allowing the mortgagor to continue in possession and otherwise acting on the mortgage. The statutes therefore had no application whatever, and by the agreement of the parties without in any way resorting to the doctrine of estoppel a good parol demise or lease at will was made out. The difficulty occasioned in the present case by the non-execution of the mortgage by the mortgagee might be got over in precisely the same way if it were possible to say that upon the true construction of the mortgage deed the parties intended to create only a tenancy at will. This, however, I am unable to do, for, differing with great respect from Mr. Justice Burton, I have failed to discover from the terms of the deed that any other tenancy was designed to be created than one which was to continue until the expiration of the time limited for the last payment under the mortgage on the 1st of June, 1888.\nThere is, however, another alternative by which as it seems to me this technical objection might be surmounted. In the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber, in Morton v. Woods,[16] delivered by Chief Baron Kelly, the following passage occurs:\u2014\nBut even if there were any doubt upon the construction of this instrument as to the intention to create a tenancy at will only, and if as was contended on behalf of the plaintiffs, it be taken to have been the intention to create a term of ten years the operation of the statute puts an end to the question. For if it had been clearly intended to grant a lease of ten years, the lease being by parol only by reason of the non-execution of the deed by the mortgagees, by the express words of the statute of frauds the lease is not absolutely void but has the effect of a lease at will. From the execution of the deed therefore, or on the attornment by the mortgagor he became tenant at will to the defendants and there being a rent of the specified amount of $800, appearing on the face of the deed a distress by them for that specific rent would be lawful.\nAlthough this was a dictum merely and was not required for the purposes of the decision in Morton v. Woods, it indicates a safe ground upon which to rest the determination of the point now under consideration in the present case. Assuming that I am wrong as to the estoppel, and aside from that principle altogether, there was here an assent by both parties to the demise clause purporting to create a present lease for a term of five years\u2014that is to say, an assent by the mortgagor in signing and sealing the deed and in remaining in possession under it, and an assent by the mortgagees by their adoption of its terms, by acting upon it in the way they did advancing their money, and allowing Darvill, the mortgagor, to continue in possession. There was, therefore, in fact, an actual present lease which would have been a good parol lease at common law for the whole term, though it was not actually valid as such for the reason that it did not comply with statutory requirements. By the express provision of the Statute of Frauds, however, as the Chief Baron pointed out in Morion v. Woods, a parol lease for a term exceeding three years is void as to the term, but is, nevertheless, to operate so far as to create a tenancy at will; and there is nothing in the subsequent statute enacting that when the statute of frauds required a writing signed by the lessor a deed should be requisite, and that the lease should be void if not made by deed, which repeals the words of the statute of frauds making the lease in such a case so far effectual as to create a tenancy at will. The later statute is to be read and construed merely as substituting a deed for the signed writing required by the earlier enactment, and the avoidance of the lease has reference only to its nullity as a lease of a term; the tenancy at will arising in such a case is not created by, nor is it dependent on the lease, but is a creation of the statute, a statutory consequence of the attempt to create a lease by parol for more than three years, and of the nullity of such a proceeding declared by the statute. There is, therefore, no more inconsistency between this implied or resulting tenancy at will raised by the statute and the provision that the lease shall be a nullity if not by deed, than there was between the original enactment that the lease should be wholly void unless in writing and signed by the lessor, and the proviso which followed saying that in such a case there should be a tenancy at will. This proviso is still preserved, although the lease for term must now be made by deed. In other words, it is apparent that the tenancy at will in such a case did not arise from the agreement of the parties, but was the effect of the statute which has never been repealed.\nThen to apply this principle to the present case it must be held that the parties having attempted to create a term of five years by a parol lease, which, as I have said, must be the result of the mortgagor having signed and sealed the deed, and of the mortgagees having assented to its terms by acting upon it in the way before mentioned, the consequence follows that this parol demise being void under the statute as a lease for five years operates as a tenancy at will under the provision of the statute of frauds. And if there was a tenancy at will it must have been a tenancy at the same rental as that expressly reserved by the demise clause in respect of the void lease. For these reasons the objection to the judgment of the Court of Appeal based on the non-execution of the mortgage deed by the mortgagees wholly fails.\nThe language of the Master of the Rolls (Jessel) in the case of Ex parte Voisey[17], is applicable to both points on which, as it appears to me, the objection founded on the non\u2011execution of the deed by the mortgagee fails, on estoppel and agreement. As I have already shown, agreeing in this respect with Mr. Justice Osler, there can be no material difference between the demise clause in the deed before us and what is called the attornment clause generally found in the mortgages which have come in question in the English cases, and the execution by the mortgagor alone of the demise clause in the present mortgage, its acceptance by the mortgagee was just as effectual as an acknowledgment of tenancy, as would have been the execution by the mortgagor alone of an attornment clause. This being so the following language of the Master of the Rolls in re Voisey seems conclusive. Sir George Jessel there says:\u2014\nBut some other points have been taken; it was said that there was no tenancy at all, because you cannot make a tenancy except by agreement, and as the mortgage deed was not executed by the mort- gagees there is no agreement. The fallacy of that argument appears to me to be in confounding agreement with evidence of agreement. Certainly there must be an evidence or else you cannot have a tenancy, but an attornment may be evidence that the landlord has entered into an agreement for a tenancy. In this case we have an attornment to the legal owner by deed executed by the tenant in possession and delivered to the legal owner, very good evidence of a tenancy, evidence therefore of an agreement for a tenancy, and as was said in ex parte Punnett[18] that is an estoppel in pais which would prevent the tenant from denying the tenancy. Therefore there is in this case a well created tenancy.\nFurther, I think it would not be difficult to demonstrate that for equitable reasons based on the doctrine of part performance this first objection is not sustainable. I think it unnecessary, however, to enter upon a consideration of them, as I consider what has already been said sufficient for the purpose.\nIt remains to consider the objection to the clause of tenancy, contained in this mortgage, which is based on the more substantial ground that it was not intended by the parties in reality to constitute by it the relation of lessor and lessee, but merely to give by means of it to the mortgagees a right corresponding to that which in case of a bon\u00e2 fide lease the lessor has to exercise the common law power of distress, and thus to extend the mortgagees\u2019 security to the chattel property which might be found on the mortgaged premises; in other words, it is insisted that upon the evidence as to the annual value of the property it must be taken as established that the tenancy which the parties assumed to create was not a bon\u00e2 fide lease but was, to use the expression applied in some of the English cases, a sham, a mere colourable contrivance, to obtain the benefit of the power of distress, which in the case of a real lease the law gives to the landlord as an incident of his reversion and by this means to acquire a priority over the creditors of the mortgagor having executions against his chattels, and also to seize and sell the goods of third persons which might be found upon the premises. I confess it is not easy to see for what object these clauses of tenancy, inserted in mortgages, were designed, except for the purpose of conferring on the mortgagor the power of making all distrainable chattel property found on the premises available towards the satisfaction of the principal and interest of the mortgage debt, and as the right of distress must necessarily in every case where it comes in conflict with the rights of assignees in bankruptcy of execution creditors or of a third person owning goods found upon the land, have the effect of prejudicing their rights in a most unjust manner I should have thought that in all cases in which a conflict occurs the right of honest creditors and innocent third parties ought to prevail over an arrangement which could only be attributed to the object mentioned or at least that this should be so in all cases where the security of the land being ample, the mortgagor, if this device of creating a tenancy had not been open to him, would never have thought of taking possession. The authorities, however, have, beyond doubt or question, established the validity of such agreements in all cases where it appears that the intention of the parties was to create a real tenacy at a real rent. The advantage accruing to the mortgagee from such a tenancy must, for some reason, be considered of considerable value, for by it there is conferred upon him a very onerous obligation, viz., the liability to account to subsequent mortgagees not only for rents actually received, but for such as might without wilful default have been received, and the mortgagee is thus compelled for his own protection to be active in enforcing his right as a lessor though his security otherwise may be ample; he is thus as it were converted into a bailiff for subsequent incumbrancers, a position which I should have thought not desirable for a mortgagee with a sufficient security, however it might be with one whose security was not ample. However, the practice of conveyancers, both in England and in this country, to insert such clauses seems to have become universal, and the decisions of the courts have now too firmly settled the validity of such provisions in mortgages to admit a doubt of their legal validity in proper cases. It is, however, laid down in several cases lately decided by the English Court of Appeal, that, however binding these claims may be between the actual parties, it is open to third persons affected by their enforcement to impeach them in cases in which it may appear from the evidence that they were not intended to create a real tenancy, but were designed merely as a cloak for an additional security to the mortgagee. The principal authorities in which this has been held or in which the doctrine has been recognized are the following, viz.: Ex parte Williams[19]; ex parte Stockton Iron Co.[20]; ex parte Jackson[21]; ex parte Punnett[22]; ex parte Threlfall[23]; and ex parte Voisey[24]. Perhaps I ought to have omitted from this list the first case mentioned, that of ex parte Williams, as the ratio decidendi in that case was that well known principle applied under bankruptcy and insolvency statutes, that any provision by a debtor that in the event of his becoming bankrupt or insolvent there shall be a different distribution of his effects from that which the law provides is void [see Watson v. Mason[25]]; the deed in that case did provide for an advantage to arise to the mortgagee from the tenancy clause in the case of bankruptcy. It is obvious that this doctrine has no application to the present case. Here we have nothing to do with bankruptcy, or insolvency statutes, and I only point this out to avoid confusion. The dicta in this case of Ex parte Williams are broad enough to cover the law as laid down in the subsequent decisions. The other cases, however, do establish the law as I have stated it, and are distinct authorities for the proposition that if it appears that the tenancy for which the mortgage deed provides is not intended by the parties to be a real lease, at a real bon\u00e2 fide rent, but is a mere sham and pretence intended merely to give the mortgagee the extraordinary remedies of a landlord, such a clause is void at least as against the assignees in bankruptcy of the mortgagor; and it has also been held that in case it should appear from evidence that the rent was greatly in excess of the annual value of the mortgaged premises, and such a rent as no bon\u00e2 fide tenant would think of paying, the fact that such an excessive and unreasonable rent had been reserved was conclusive to show that the parties could not have intended to create a tenancy, and that the arrangement must therefore be considered unreal and fictitious.\nIn Ex parte Jackson (ubi supra) Baggallay L.J. says:\nNow as was pointed out by the Master of the Rolls, in re Stockton Iron Furnace Company, there was nothing unreasonable in the original introduction into mortgage deeds of attornment clauses in cases in which the mortgagor was in possession of the mortgaged premises. If the mortgaged premises had been occupied by a stranger the mortgagee could at any time have demanded from him payment of his rent in arrear and he could have applied any rent paid to him under such a demand in discharge in whole or part of the interest in arrear on his mortgage and if the rent received by him was more than sufficient to discharge the interest it could be applied in discharge or satisfaction pro tanto of the mortgage debt. Now so far as any inference can be drawn from the practice of inserting attornment clauses it appears to me that the benefit to be derived by the attornment clause was in- tended to be an equivalent for that which the mortgagee would have derived from the rent if the tenant had been a stranger. What would that equivalent be? Would it not be the right to the payment of a fair and reasonable rent such as an ordinary tenant would be willing to give for the property under ordinary circumstances. That as it seems to me, is the rent for which a properly prepared attornment clause should make provision; not necessarily the exact amount which a tenant would pay for the property, bat such an amount as a willing tenant would probably pay as a bon\u00e2 fide rent. If the rent so reserved is clearly in excess of what would be a fair and reasonable rent it appears to me though that you may call it rent, it is no longer a real rent but a fictitious payment under the name of rent.\nIn this same case of Ex parte Jackson, we find the following passage in the judgment of Cotton L.J.\nUndoubtedly a mortgagor and a mortgagee have a right to insert in their mortgage deed a clause making the mortgagor attorn as tenant to the mortgagee and thus by contract constituting the relation of landlord and tenant between them. Under such circumstances when it is a real and not a fictitious and sham arrangement the ordinary consequences of a tenancy follow and there can be a distress for the rent agreed upon which will be valid and effectual in the case of bankruptcy. As has been pointed out by Lord Justice Baggalley, this is quite reasonable for the mortgagee has a right to take possession and to turn out the mortgagor whether he be in possession by himself or his tenant. If the mortgagor is in possession by a tenant then the rent which that tenant pays comes into the hands of the mortgagee. If the property is in the possession of the mortgagor himself the mortgagee may turn him out and let the property either to a stranger or to the mortgagor; and, therefore, there is nothing unreasonable or that can be called a fraud in the law of bankruptcy in allowing the parties to make a contract in the mortgage deed which they might validly and effectually make afterwards. If the mortgagee lets to a third party no question can arise as to the amount of the rent; and if the attornment clause is one which really constitutes the relation of landlord and tenant between the mortgagor and mortgagee the court will not be nice in considering whether the rent is too great for the mortgaged property. But it is a very different question which we have now to consider, viz., whether there is a real or only a fictitious or ostensible contract to constitute the relation of landlord and tenant. On that question the amount of the rent created may be most material; it may be so excessive as to afford even of itself, a probability that that which is in form a contract constituting the relation of landlord and tenant and reserving a return for the use of the property was not so in substance and fact but was a mere colour in order to cover something else. Nor is it material how the rent, if rent is to be applied. No doubt, the rent may be sufficient to cover the interest, but if it is more than sufficient to cover the interest and is received by the mortgagee he must apply it in reduction of the capital, subject to the question whether the interest was in arrear at the time he took possession for as against a mortgagor in possession when the interest is not in arrear an account would be taken with annual rents. Therefore, the stipulation that a rent fairly reserved, a real rent, is to be applied in paying the principal and interest of the mortgage debt, cannot avoid a contract which in other respects is a real contract and not a mere device to cover something else.\nFurther on the learned Judge says:\u2014\nUnder these circumstances the conclusion to which I have come is this, that there was no real rent, though a sum was stipulated for under the name of rent. But it was not a rent in respect of which the legal incident of distress arises, and, therefore, on the ground that there was no legal right to distrain the bank under their distress, have not got any title to these goods which, unless there has been an effectual distress, remained the property of the bankrupt. And I go further than that. No doubt, any distress which is exercised does give to a mortgagee, if he is a landlord, something which he would not have got if he had not exercised it. But, yet, it must be a distress for a real rent, to which the law has annexed as an incident the power of distress.\nLord Justice Cotton also says:\u2014\nHere there was no real rent and no real relationship of landlord and tenant, and, therefore, there was no power of distress.\nIn the same case Lord Justice Thesiger holds the following language:\u2014\nTherefore although it is clear that persons may bargain with each other as to the amount of rent and the courts will not rightly interfere with bargains so made it is obvious looking at the nature of these uses and the object with which they can be legitimately inserted in mortgage deeds that the amount of the rent may, under certain circumstances, become a matter very important to consider in order to determine whether they are real attornment clauses, whether the rent fixed is a real rent and whether a real tenancy has been created. * * * Granted that these attornment clauses are valid and operative under ordinary circumstances, yet if from the terms of the particular deed or from the amount of the rent fixed by the attornment clause it can be concluded by the court that the rent is not a real rent buta mere sham, and that the attornment clause is a mere device to give the mortgagee a hold in the event of bankruptcy over the goods and chattels of the mortgagor which could otherwise have been distributed among his general creditors then the attornment clause is invalid and inoperative because it is a fraud upon the bankruptcy law. * * *\nThe learned judge also says:\nThe question is whether for any purpose there was a real rent or real tenancy.\nAnd he adds:\nBut here the right of distress can only be supported upon the ordinary principles of law which attach that right to a legitimate tenancy with a legitimate rent. If once you arrive at the conclusion that there is no tenancy and no rent, but that the attornment clause creates only a sham tenancy and a sham rent for purposes such as I have described, then it follows that no distress, can by the ordinary principles of law be attached to such a tenancy in respect of such a rent and for that reason it seems to me, that no legitimate distinction can be drawn between a distress levied before and a distress levied after bankruptcy.\nIn the last reported case, that of ex parte Voisey (ubi supra) the judges are equally distinct in their enunciation of the same principles of law. Thus Brett L.J. says:\nThat raises the question whether the contract was a bon\u00e2 fide one. Now in what sense can it be said that it was not bon\u00e2 fide? Whatever may be its terms, and however excessive the rent, it is not a fraud as between the parties because nothing was concealed by the one from the other, and both agreed to the terms. Therefore it could not be a fraud as between the parties. It was not intended to defraud any known individual.\nAnd the Lord Justice then proceeds to point out that it was a fraud on the bankruptcy law. In the same case L.J. Cotton affirms distinctly and emphatically the law as he had laid it down in the previous case and thus expresses himself:\nIt is undoubted that a mortgagor may enter into a contract with his mortgagee, that the mortgagor shall be a tenant to the mortgagee and it is equally undoubted that the law gives certain rights and priorities to a landlord but the question is whether the contract between the parties was one under which (whatever were the words they used) they really intended to create the relation of landlord and tenant, or whether, under the mask of certain words, they intended, without any real tenancy, to endeavour to give to the mortgagee all those rights which he could have only if he was landlord and the mortgagor was his tenant. This may be put in other words. It may be said that the question is, whether there was between the parties any real relation of landlord and tenant or whether whatever were the words used it was all a sham. In considering that question we must look at both the amount of the rent or what is called the rent and the other circumstances, and if we find that the so-called rent is so excessive that it never could have been meant to be paid by the occupier to the owner of the land for its use and occupation, that is very strong evidence indeed that there was no real intention to create a tenancy.\nAnd subsequently the learned judge adds, referring to Ex parte Jackson:\u2014\nIn that case there could be no doubt that there was a mere nominal creation of the relation of landlord and tenant, or that in reality the intention was to try and get the benefit which a landlord only can have over any other creditor by using the words landlord and tenant without any intention of creating any such relation.\nIt is to be observed of all these cases that they are instances in which the validity of the leasing clause was impugned by assignees in bankruptcy, and therefore the language is in some respects confined to the rights of such persons. I am of opinion, however, and the passages I have extracted from the judgments delivered in the Court of Appeal entirely bear me out, that it was not intended to restrict the principles laid down to cases in which the question was raised after a bankruptcy, but that these principles must be generally applied wherever the interests of third persons require their application. Some of the learned judges in the judgments I have quoted from, lay it down generally that when it appears on the face of the deed, or otherwise, that an actual demise at a bon\u00e2 fide rent was not really intended by the parties, but that the pretended demise was a mere contrivance to enlarge the mortgagee\u2019s remedies, the common law incident of a right of distress would not attach at all. The mort- gagor himself would be considered as having incapacitated himself from asserting the invalidity of what he had deliberately affirmed to be the true relation between himself and the mortgagee in an instrument under seal, but as regards third parties interested in so doing I know of no reason why it should be confined to any particular class such as assignees in bankruptcy. The avoidance of the fictitious lease at the fictitious rent is not dependent on any principle peculiar to the bankrupt laws, but proceeds on this\u2014that when there is no real tenancy, and therefore no real rent, an extraordinary and very stringent remedy which the common law has made an incident of the reversion for the purpose of recovering a rent service cannot exist. And if it does not \u201clie in the mouth\u201d of the mortgagor to assert this, it ought nevertheless to be open to all third parties really interested to do so. Therefore I regard the cases in which it has been considered open to assignees in bankruptcy in the interest of the general creditors to set up the colorable character of an attornment clause, as only instances of the application of a general rule which upon every ground of reason and law must also apply to other third parties whose rights ought only to be intercepted by a bon\u00e2 fide landlord and especially to execution creditors of the mortgagor as well as to persons whose goods are sought to be taken by one who has no real but only a pretended and colourable right to the privilege which he assumes to exercise.\nIt only remains to enquire whether this mortgage deed does upon its face show that the parties did not really intend to constitute the relation of landlord and tenant. The passages which I have extracted from the judgments delivered in the English Court of Appeal show that upon this enquiry the gross excess of the rent over the actual rental value of the property is conclusive. That being so there is no alternative but to pronounce against the validity of the alleged tenancy in the present instance at least so far as it would affect the appellants and make them liable to the claim asserted by the mortgagees. The evidence is conclusive to show that $750 per annum is the highest annual value which can be placed on the mortgaged property. The rent reserved is in the aggregate $20,000 for the five years of the pretended tenancy. This would make a rental of $4,000.00 a year more than four times the actual value. This is sufficient to establish that the parties never intended to create a tenancy at such a rental otherwise than for the indirect purposes to which I have before referred, and it must therefore be adjudged that the respondents have failed to make out their right to the arrears they claim. Mr. Justice Rose thought the difficulty could be got over by excluding the rent for the last year and treating the rental reserved for the first four years as a bon\u00e2 fide rent, but I do not feel at liberty so to model the contract of the parties; we must take it in its integrity and so taken it shows that for a term of five years a gross rental of $20,000 was reserved and this is so greatly in excess of the real value that we must assume that it never was the intention of the parties to make a true lease at such a rent; and the circumstance that the payments to be made for the first four years were moderate and fair in amount cannot do away with the inevitable inference to be drawn from the payment of $15,500 stipulated to be made for the last year of the term.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs to the appellants in all the courts and judgment must be entered in the interpleader issue accordingly.\nFOURNIER, J. concurred with STRONG J. TASCHEREAU J. was of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by the Chief Justice.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Upon the 31st of May, 1883, one David Darvill executed an indenture of mortgage in pursuance of the Ontario Act respecting short forms of mortgages of certain lands therein mentioned, in favor of the Ontario Loan and Debenture Company, for the purpose of securing re-payments to them of the sum of twenty thousand dollars then lent by them to Darvill, together with interest thereon; the clause or proviso for redemption contained in the mortgage was that the mortgage should be void on payment of twenty thousand dollars of gold coin of legal tender in Canada, or at the option of the mortgagees or their assigns the then equivalent thereof of lawful money of Canada with interest at seven per centum per annum, as follows:\u2014\nFive hundred dollars of paid principal sum to be paid on the first day of December next (1883), five hundred dollars on the first day of each of the months of June and December in each of the four following years, 1884, 1885, 1886 and 1887, and fifteen thousand five hundred dollars, being the balance of the said principal sum, on the first day of June, in the year eighteen hundred and eighty-eight; and the interest at the rate aforesaid, likewise of gold coin, on the unpaid principal from the first day of the month of June next (1883), to be paid semi-annually on the first day of each of the months of June and December until the said principal sum and interest shall be fully paid and satisfied; the first of the said semi-annual payments of interest to become payable on the first day of December, in the year eighteen hundred and eighty-three, and taxes and performance of statute labor; the mortgagor, his heirs or assigns, having the privilege of paying one hundred dollars, or any multiple thereof not exceeding one thousand dollars on account of the said principal moneys in advance on the days of any of the above mentioned half-yearly payments.\nThere was a proviso that on default of payment for one month the mortgagees might on one month\u2019s notice enter upon and lease or sell the said lands, and further, that in default of payment of any instalment of principal or interest thereby secured the whole of the principal thereby secured should become payable.\nThe fifteenth clause of the form of mortgage given in the schedule to the act, that is to say, the clause providing that the mortgagee might destrain for arrears of interest, which, as extended in the statutory form, (is expressed to be for the purpose of enabling the mortgagee in case the mortgagor should make default in payment of any part of the interest secured by the mortgage at any of the days and times limited for the payment thereof to destrain therefor on the mortgaged premises, and by distress to recover by way of rent reserved, as in the case of a demise, such arrears of interest, was altogether omitted from the mortgage, and a clause not in the statutory form given in the schedule to the act was inserted, in the terms following:\u2014\nAnd the mortgagees lease to the mortgagor the said lands from the date hereof until the date herein provided for the last payment of any of the moneys hereby secured, undisturbed by the mortgagees or their assigns, he, the said mortgagor, paying therefor in every year during the said term, on each and every of the days in the above proviso for redemption appointed for payment of the moneys hereby secured, such rent or sum as equals in amount the amount payable on such days respectively, according to the said proviso, without any deduction, and it is agreed that such payments, when so made, shall respectively be taken and be in all respects in satisfaction of the moneys so then payable according to the said proviso. Provided always, and it is agreed that in case any of the covenants or agreements herein of the mortgagor, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, be untrue, or be unobserved or broken at any time, the mortgagees, their successors or assigns, may, without any previous demand or notice, enter on the said lands or any part thereof in the name of the whole and take and retain possession thereof and determine the said lease, and no reconveyance, release or discharge from these presents, or of any part or parts of the said lands by the mortgagees or their assigns shall cause an apportionment of the said rent, but the whole thereof shall be payable out of the remainder of the said lands.\nUpon the first day of June, 1887, the sheriff of the county in which the lands were situate seized certain chattel property of the mortgagor upon the mortgaged premises to the amount of about three thousand dollars to satisfy an execution placed in his hands to be executed, which had issued upon a judgment recovered by the above appellants against the mortgagor. Upon the 8th day of the said month of June, a notice, upon behalf of the mortgagees, was served upon the sheriff in the words following:\u2014\nTo the sheriff of the County of Middlesex, &c., &c. Take notice that the sum of three thousand one hundred and eighty dollars is now due and owing to the Ontario Loan and Debenture Company from David Darvill, of the City of London, manufacturer, for the following payments of rent of the premises in his occupation at said City of London and township of Westminster: $1,077.50 due on the 1st day of June, 1886, $1,060.00 due on the 1st day of December, 1886, and $1,042.50 due on the 1st day of June, 1887, under and by virtue of an indenture dated 31st May, 1883, made by said David Darvill to said company, upon which premises you claim to have seized and taken in execution certain goods and chattels. And you are hereby required not to remove any of said the goods and chattels from off the said premises until the said arrears of rent are paid pursuant to the statute in such case made and provided. Dated this 8th day of June, 1887.\nAn interpleader issue was sent down to be tried in pursuance of an order in that behalf, dated the 5th day of September, 1887, wherein the said Ontario Loan and Debenture Company were plaintiffs and the said appellants and others execution creditors of the said David Darvill were defendants, and wherein\nthe said plaintiffs affirmed and the said defendants denied that the said plaintiffs are entitled as landlords of David Darvill, or otherwise under the mortgage from the said David Darvill to the plaintiffs, dated the 31st day of May, A.D. 1883, to be paid out of the moneys realized on the sale of the goods and chattels of the said David Darvill seized on the 1st day of June, 1887, in execution by the sheriff of the County of Middlesex, the sum of $1,077.50 and $1,060.00 due to the plaintiffs for arrears of rent or otherwise under said mortgage, and payable on the 1st June, 1886, and the 1st December, 1886, respectively in respect of the lands upon which the said goods and chattels were, at the time of the seizure and sale thereof, or some part thereof, as against the execution creditors.\nMr. Justice Rose before whom the interpleader issue was tried without a jury, found, as matters of fact, that at the date of the mortgage a large portion of the mortgaged property was under lease to persons who were tenants of the mortgagor, and as I understand his judgment that the annual rents of the property so under lease was at the time of the execution of the mortgage about $2,250, and the annual value of the part in the actual occupation of the mortgagor, $1,216; or a total annual value of nearly $3,500. The learned judge was of opinion that in estimating the bon\u00e2 fides of the creation of the relation of landlord and tenant he might separate the annual payments to be made in the first four years from the residue, thus, the amounts to be paid under the proviso contained in the mortgage appears to have been for the first year, terminating on the 1st June, 1884, $2,382,50; for the second year, terminating 1st June, 1885, $2,312.50; for the third year, terminating 1st June, 1886, $2,242.50; for the fourth year, terminating 1st June, 1887, $2,172.50. These amounts the learned judge was of opinion would not be an excessive rent if he was at liberty to compare such annual payments alone with the annual value of the whole of the mortgaged property, including that already under lease to the mortgagor\u2019s tenants, but if such four annual payments, as above, should be regarded as issuing only out of the land in the actual occupation of the mortgagor, then he was of opinion that even these amounts would be so excessive, having regard to the actual annual value of the land in such actual occupation of the mortgagor, as to prevent the transaction being held to be one in which a bon\u00e2 fide lease at a rent reserved was in reality intended, and that, therefore, the relation of landlord and tenant had not been created, and he came to the conclusion that he might determine the bon\u00e2 fides of the transaction by such comparison of the first four annual payments with the annual value of the whole property instead of with the value only of that part which was in the actual occupation of the mortgagor, but he was further of opinion that if he was bound to take into consideration the $15,500 of principal, together with the interest on the unpaid principal made payable at the expiration of the term, amounting together to the sum of $16,042.60, he must hold that to be so excessive as to exclude all idea that a real rent was intended to be reserved; he came, however, to the conclusion, upon the authority of Kitching v. Hicks[26], that he could exclude from consideration such last mentioned reservation and that, therefore, he could hold the lease to be good as to the rent reserved payable up to 1888, and so he held the plaintiff to be entitled to recover on the issue upon the authority of Morton v. Woods[27], Ex parte Jackson[28], and In re Stockton Iron Furnace Company[29], which cases, he considered, governed the present. The Queen\u2019s Bench Division upon appeal reversed this judgment, and held the clause as to the lease of the premises by the mortgagees to the mortgagor to be void, as it was for a term exceeding three years and was not by deed, the mortgagees never having executed the deed\u2014and that the relation of landlord and tenant was never in reality intended to be created\u2014that there was no tenancy at a rent reserved on a lease for years at will or otherwise, so as to entitle the mortgagees to claim as landlords under statute 8 Anne ch. 14 the amounts claimed by them as due for rent for any lands leased by them to the mortgagor.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario, upon appeal to them from the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, were of opinion that the case was governed by West v. Fritche[30], Morton v. Woods[31], In re Threlfall[32], Ex parte Voisey[33], Walsh v. Lonsdale[34], Allhusen v. Brooking[35], and other cases, and they reversed the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division and restored the judgment of Rose J.\nIn this conflict of opinion, I find myself compelled to concur substantially with the judgment of the Queen\u2019s Bench Division, that this is not a case of a rent reserved on a lease for a term of years, at will or otherwise, within the provisions of the statute 8 Anne c. 14, and for the following reasons: In West v. Fritche[36], the mortgage deed, although executed by the mortgagor only, contained the ordinary attornment clause, whereby,\nfor the better and more effectual recovery of the interest of the said sum of \u00a3800 by and out of the rents, issues and profits of the said messuage, hereditaments and effects, the mortgagor did attorn and become tenant to the said G. Fritche, his executors, &c., of the same premises, at the yearly rent of \u00a340, to be paid half-yearly on the 9th day of June and the 9th day of December in every year, during so long time as the said sum of \u00a3800 or any part thereof shall remain secured upon said premises.\nNow, it is to be observed that in this case no question under the statute of frauds, or 8 & 9 Vic. ch. 106, arose. The mortgagor did not attorn as tenant for any term of years at all\u2014the tenancy might not have lasted for three years, and the statute of frauds, as decided in Ex parte Voisey[37], applies only where the tenancy, if good, must, of the necessity of the contract, last more than three years, or that the case was one simply of a tenancy for a term not required to be in writing by the statute of frauds; and the decision merely was that in such a case continuance in occupation by the mortgagor under the covenant involved in his express attornment to the mortgagees as their tenant, did create the relation of landlord and tenant, and did entitle the mortgagees to destrain. Parke B. giving the judgment of the court said:\nWe all think that the subsequent occupation coupled with the covenant constituted the relation of landlord and tenant.\nMorton v. Woods[38], raised a question merely of intention on the construction of the deed. There a mortgagor in possession executed a second mortgage of the mortgaged premises to the defendants to secure repayment with interest of certain advances. The mortgage was by indenture between the mortgagor and the defendants, but was not executed by the latter. The mortgagor conveyed to the defendants all the premises comprised in the first mortgage, which was recited, upon trust that the defendants should either immediately, or at any time, sell the premises, and should apply the purchase money to arise from such sale in the manner therein mentioned:\u2014\nAnd as further security for the principal and interest moneys for the time being due from the mortgagor under and by virtue of the indenture, he did thereby attorn and become tenant to the defendants, their heirs and assigns, as and from the date thereof of such of the said hereditaments and premises thereby granted or otherwise conveyed as was or were in his occupation for and during the term of ten years, if that security should so long continue, at and under the yearly rent of \u00a3800 to be paid yearly on every first day of October, in every year, the first yearly rent to be paid and payable on the first day of October then next, provided that notwithstanding anything therein contained, and without any notice or demand of possession, it should be lawful for the defendants, their heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, before or after the execution of the trusts of sale therein contained, to enter into and upon the said mortgaged premises or any part thereof and to eject the said grantor and any tenant claiming under him therefrom, and to determine the said term of ten years, notwithstanding any lease or leases that might have been granted by the grantor.\nIt appears, then, that by the deed in that case the grantees were empowered to execute the trusts of sale either immediately or at any time at their will and pleasure, and they were empowered before or alter the execution of the trusts of the deed to evict the grantor and all persons claiming under him. This was a power also to be exercised at the sole will and pleasure of the grantees. It was held, therefore, that upon the true construction of the deed these provisions, notwithstanding the attornment clause being for a term of ten years, showed plainly the intention of the parties to be that the grantor, by his attornment, should become tenant at will of the grantees paying rent for ten years, if permitted by the grantees to remain so long in possession. That was not the case of a lease which, if good, was intended to last for ten years, and therefore neither the statute of frauds, nor 8 & 9 Vic. ch. 106, requiring leases for more than three years to be by deed, applied. Cockburn CJ. giving judgment, says:[39].\nWith reference to the intention to create a term, and the failure by reason of the non\u2011execution of the deed, any tenancy for a term not beyond three years may be created without any deed or writing, and in my opinion it is plain that all the tenancy the parties intended to create was a tenancy at will, no more and no less. The primary object of the parties was to secure to the mortgagees the amplest remedies to enforce the repayment of the mortgage money and interest, and though the term of ten years is mentioned it was intended, on the one hand that the lessors should be fully empowered to turn the mortgagor out at any moment, and so to realize their security by sale, while on the other hand the mortgagor should be empowered to get rid of his tenancy by paying off the mortgage money. That, I conceive, amounts to all intents and purposes to no more nor less than an intention to create a tenancy at will, which might be created without any deed.\nThen Blackburn J. said:[40]. When we look at the instrument to ascertain the intention of the parties, is it the true construction that they intended to create a term of ten years? I cannot think they intended that: the intention was that the mortgagor should become tenant at will to the mortgagees, with the understanding that he should be permitted to remain for ten years, should the will not be determined before.\nAnd it is upon this construction that the case of West v. Fritche was applied. Miller J. says:\nI cannot help thinking that upon the true construction of this deed it was the object of the parties that John Brown should become tenant at a fixed rent to the defendants so as to give them the power of distress, and that it could not have been the intention to create a term of ten years when he was liable to be evicted at any moment, but they intended to create a tenancy at will only.\nAnd Lush J., says:[41]\nThe first question is, what term did the parties intend the mortgagor should take from the mortgagees so long as the mortgage money remained unpaid? If a term of ten years, then the intended demise failed; if a term less than three years then the mere assent of the parties amounted to a demise. It is plain that there was no intention that the mortgagor should remain in possession any given length of time, but that he should remain on the premises at the will of the mortgagees, he binding himself to pay \u00a3800 for a term not exceeding ten years, if left in possession so long. That being the intention the intended demise did not require a deed for its validity, and the objection that the mortgagees did not execute the deed falls to the ground.\nThis construction put upon the deed by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench was affirmed in the Exchequer Chamber[42] and the result is that but for these provisions in the deed which showed that the true intention of the parties was to create a tenancy for an indeterminate period, which might have been less than three years and not a term for ten years certain, the attornment clause would have failed to create the relation of landlord and tenant between the mortgagor and mortgagees. In re Stockton Iron Furnace Company[43] the question was, whether the sum of \u00a35,000 reserved as an annual rent by an attornment clause in a mortgage was so unreasonable as to demonstrate that the attornment clause was inserted as a sham and not with the intention of creating a tenancy in reality. No question arose as to whether the tenancy was void as being for more than three years. In point of fact it was not for a term exceeding three years and so did not require a deed for its validity. The attornment clause was in the following terms:\u2014\nAnd this indenture further witnesseth that in pursuance of the said recited agreement, and for the consideration aforesaid, the said company do hereby attorn and become tenants from year to year to the the said parties hereto of the second part, their heirs and assigns, for and in respect of the said mortgaged premises at the yearly rent of \u00a35,000, clear of all deductions, to be paid by equal half-yearly payments on the 23rd day of August and the 23rd day of February in every year, the first half yearly payment to be made on the 23rd day of August next. Provided always, and it is hereby declared, that it shall be lawful for the said parties hereto of the second part, their heirs and assigns, at any time after the said 23rd day of August next, without giving previous notice of their intention so to do to enter upon and take possession of the hereditaments and premises whereof the said company have attorned and became tenants as aforesaid, and to determine the tenancy created by the aforesaid attornment and put out and expel the said company from the said hereditaments and premises without any ejectment or other legal process as effectually as a sheriff might do in case the landlords had obtained judgment in ejectment for the recovery of such possession and a writ of habere facias possessionem had issued on such judgment.\nThe tenancy created by this atttornment was one from year to year, determinable, however, at the will of the mortgagees at any time after the expiration of the first six months. In Ex parte Jackson[44], in the Court of Appeal, no question arose either as to the validity or invalidity of the tenancy purported to be created by the attornment clause in a mortgage, by reason of its having been for a period in excess of three years and not created by deed. The question was whether the amount reserved as rent was not so excessive as to demonstrate that no tenancy was, in reality, intended to be created. In it, however, the cases of Morton v. Woods and In re Stockton Furnace Company underwent much consideration, and the principle involved in them was explained. The attornment clause in the mortgage was as follows:\nThe mortgagor doth hereby attorn and become tenant to the said company and their assigns of the hereditaments hereinbefore expressed to be hereby granted and assigned, or such part thereof as is in the possession of the mortgagor, as tenant, from year to year, from the date hereof at the annual rent of \u00a3800,&c.\nLord Justice Baggallay giving judgment in that case says:[45].\nNow, so far as any inference can be drawn from the practice of inserting attornment clauses, it appears to me that the benefit to be derived from the attornment clause was intended to be an equivalent for that which the mortgagee would derive from the rent if the tenant had been a stranger. What would that equivalent be? Would it not be a right to the payment of a fair and reasonable rent such as an ordinary tenant would be willing to give for the property under ordinary circumstances. That, as it seems to me, is the rent for which a properly prepared attornment clause should make provision, not necessarily the exact amount which a tenant would pay for the property, but such an amount as a willing tenant would probably pay as a bon\u00e2 fide rent. If the rent so reserved is clearly in excess of what would be a fair and reasonable rent, it appears to me that although you may call it rent, it is no longer a real rent, but a fictitious payment under the name of rent.\nAnd referring to Morton v. Woods, he says:[46].\nNow, the case of Morton v. Woods has been referred to on behalf of the respondents, and the view presented by their counsel, as I understand it, is this: that it is quite immaterial what the amount of rent is which you place upon the premises by an attornment clause, you are at liberty to make it as much as you choose\u2014to cover the whole principal and interest if you think fit, and the court will not interfere with it\u2014but Morton v. Woods does not decide that. It decides, as a general rule, an attornment clause is not in itself unlawful, provided it is real. The rent need not be limited to the amount of interest from time to time becoming due upon the mortgage debt. It is not introduced for that purpose alone, although it is one way of securing the interest. The measure of the real rent is the leasable value of the property, not the amount of the mortgage debt. In Morton v. Woods there was no suggestion that the rent fixed by the attornment clause was other than the real and proper rent, and as I read the case all that the court decided was the general principle that effect will be given to attornment clauses when they are real and carry out the true intention of the parties to them, so far as that intention is limited to creating the relation of landlord and tenant in the proper sense.\nIn the same case Lord Justice Cotton, p. 739, says:\nUndoubtedly a mortgagor and a mortgagee have a right to insert in their mortgage deed a clause making the mortgagor attorn as tenant to the mortgagees, and thus by contract constituting the relation of landlord and tenant between the two. Under such circumstances where it is a real and not a fictitious or sham arrangement the ordinary consequences of a tenancy follow, and there can be no distress for the rent agreed upon, which will be valid and effectual in the case of bankruptcy. As has been pointed out by Lord Justice Baggalley this is quite reasonable for the mortgagor whether he is in possession by himself or by his tenant. If the mortgagor is in possession by a tenant then the rent which that tenant pays comes into the hands of the mortgagee. If the property is in the possession of the mortgagor himself the mortgagee may turn him out and let the property either to a stranger or to the mortgagor, and, therefore, there is nothing unreasonable or that can be called a fraud in the Law of Bankruptcy, in allowing the parties to make a contract in the mortgage deed which they might validly and effectually make afterwards.\nAnd again, p. 741, he says:\u2014\nUnder these circumstances the conclusion to which I come is this, at that there was no real rent although a sum was stipulated for under the name of rent But it was not a rent in respect of which the legal incident of distress arises.\nAnd again:\u2014\nNo doubt any distress which is exercised does give to a mortgagee, if he is a landlord, something that he could not have got if he had not exercised it. But, yet, it must be a distress for a real rent to which the law has annexed as an incident the power of distress. When there is no real rent but something called rent which in fact is not rent, then, in my opinion, the clause which attempts to give the power of distress incident to rent, in respite of that which is not rent, and thus to give to a mortgagee a right which he would only have as landlord and not as mortgagee, to give it to him as mortgagee and not as landlord is an attempt to alter and disturb the legal distribution of the mortgagor\u2019s property in bankruptcy.\nAnd he came to the conclusion, concurring with the rest of the court, that in the case under consideration it was a mere sham calling the sum reserved by the attornment clause rent; and Lord Justice Thesiger, in the same case, referring to these attornment clauses on mortgages, says on p. 743:\nI can even imagine a case in which the rent reserved may be sufficient to pay both principal and interest. But while that is so it must be admitted that the object of attornment clauses is, while giving any additional security to the mortgagee to place him as regards the mortgagor who is left in possession of the property and in the matter of rent in the same position in which he would have been if the mortgaged premises had been under lease to a third party. Therefore, although it is clear that persons may bargain with each other as to the amount of rent, and the courts will not lightly interfere with bargains so made, it is obvious, looking at the nature of these clauses, and the object with which they can be legitimately inserted in mortgage deeds, that the amount of the rent may, under certain circumstances, become a matter very important to consider, in order to determine whether they are real attornment clauses, whether the rent fixed is a real rent and whether a real tenancy has been created that, I understand to be the rule laid down by the authorities which have been cited. Granted that these attornment clauses are valid and operative under ordinary circumstances, yet, if from the terms of the particular deed, or from the amount of the rent fixed by the attornment clause, it can be concluded by the court that the rent is not a real rent, but a mere sham, that the tenancy is not a real tenancy, but a mere sham, and that the attornment clause is a mere device to give the mortgagee a hold in the event of bankruptcy over the goods and chattels of the mortgagor which would otherwise have been distributed among his general creditors, then the attornment clause is invalid and inoporative.\nIn re Threlfall[47], in the Court of Appeal, the attornment clause created a tenancy from year to year deter- minable at the will of the mortgagee at any time after the expiration of three months from the date of the mortgage. The contention there was that upon the authority of Morton v. Woods, the tenancy created by the attornment clause was at will for the purpose of contending that the tenancy was determined by a liquidation petition of the mortgagor, and that, therefore, the distress which was subsequent to the filing of the liquidation petition, and to its coming to the knowledge of the mortgagee was invalid. Lord Justice James delivering judgment there, says:\nWe are asked in this case not to construe a deed, but to contradict it for the purpose of entirely destroying the intention of the parties to it. The mortgagor was left in possession of the property, and was thereby enabled to give a power of distress to the mortgagee. The attornment clause was in the common form, and was intended to create the relation of landlord and tenant between the parties. The mortgagor, by the express terms of the deed, was to be tenant from year to year at the yearly rent specified. This tenancy was determinable at the will of the mortgagee, but this power the mortgagee would equally have had if the premises were in the possession of a third party, and it is the usual power given to a mortgagee to enable him to take possession. We are asked to say that in spite of the express terms of the deed this was not a yearly tenancy, but a tenancy at will, on account of some expressions of some of the judges in Morton v. Woods. But in that case there was no actual demise, but for the purpose of giving effect to the manifest intention of the parties it was held that a tenancy at will had been created.\nAnd Lord Justice Lush, who was himself one of the judges who had decided Morton v. Woods, says, p. 282:\nAlthough in Morton v. Woods the expression \u201ctenancy at will\u201d was used by some of the judges while professing to describe the relation between the parties, yet it must not be taken as intended to be an exact legal definition, particularly when we consider the facts and arguments before them. In all cases the words of a judgment must be considered with reference to the arguments adduced. I am rather glad to see that I did not myself describe the tenancy as a tenancy at will. But the argument in that case was that the attornment was for ten years, and if so void because not made by deed, and, therefore, the judges said that it was a tenancy at will, meaning a tenancy for an in- definite term not to exceed ten years, determinable at the will of the landlord.\nThis case is valuable as an affirmation by the Court of Appeal of what had been in effect held in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, that if that court had not found expressions in the mortgage which showed that the creation of a tenancy for ten years had not been and could not have been intended, and if they had been obliged to construe the deed as intended to create a tenancy for ten years, they must have held that the attornment had failed to create the relation of landlord and tenant between the mortgagee and mortgagor. In ex parte Punnett[48] counsel referring to a tenancy under an attornment clause in a mortgage argued that such a tenancy operated by estoppel, \u201cno doubt,\u201d they said, \u201cit is a fiction,\u201d and referring to Morton v. Woods they said:\nMorton v. Woods is a decision that the court will give effect to a fiction against the rights of creditors;\nTo which observation Lord Justice Lush replied:\nBy giving effect to the fiction the manifest intention of the parties was carried out.\nAgain showing that the judgment in Morton v. Woods vested on the fact that the clause in the mortgage relied upon by the court in that case showed that the manifest intention of the parties was not to create a term of ten years, but a term determinable at the will of the mortgagee landlord, and so not necessary to be created by deed. In ex parte Voisey[49], the attornment clause in the mortgage which was executed by the mortgagor only was in the following terms:\u2014\nAnd for better securing the payments, which by the rules of the society (building society) ought to be made by the mortgagor, it was agreed that if the mortgagees should, at any time, become entitled to enter into possession or receipt of the rents, and if the mortgagor should then or afterwards be in the occupation of the whole or part of the property, he should, during such occupation, be tenant thereof from month to month to the mortgagees at a monthly rent equal in amount to the moneys which ought to be paid monthly by the mortgagor from time to time for subscriptions, interest, fines, and other moneys under the rules, and that the tenancy should commence on the day up to which he should have paid all and every part of such subscriptions, fines and other moneys, and the rent for the period intervening between the commencement of the tenancy and the day on which the trustees should be entitled to enter into possession or receipt of rents should be payable and paid on the day, and the monthly rent due upon and subsequently to that day should become due monthly in advance, and be payable at the monthly meetings, the first payment of rent becoming due on that day on which the mortgagees should first becoming entitled to enter into possession.\nPower was also given to the mortgagees to determine the tenancy by fourteen day\u2019s notice.\nNow, it is obvious that under this attornment clause, the contemplated tenancy might never commence, and if it ever should commence it might not continue (even though not determined by the mortgagees under the power in that behalf vested in them), so long as three years\u2014the term when it should, if it ever should commence was to be a monthly tenancy. It was not a case, therefore, coming either within the Imperial Statute 8 and 9 Vic. ch. 106 sec. 3, from which the Ontario Statute ch. 100, sec. 8 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario is taken, or within the statute of frauds as necessary to be in writing. Jessel, Master of the Rolls there says, p. 456:\nAnother objection was taken that there was some provision in the statute of frauds which affects the case. I am not aware of any. It does not appear to me that this was within the statute of frauds at all, indeed it was not even a lease for years, because we do not know how long it may last, it may not last for three years or for one year, and it does not appear to be obnoxious to the statute of frauds.\nAgain:\nYou must construe a deed according to the words used in it, you can only gather the intention of the parties from the words they use, and here they have not made it a tenancy at will. It may be put an end to by the mortgagees, no doubt, if they think fit, but it is not a tenancy at will\u2014it is a tenancy from month to month\u2014a monthly tenancy.\nLord Justice Brett says:\nThis is not a tenancy within the statute of frauds at all. The first section of the statute of frauds applies only where the tenancy, if good, must of necessity last for more than three years. But if at the time of the arrangement, the tenancy may last for less than three years, although it may last for more, it is not within the section of the statute at all, and it is obvious that the tenancy in this case, although it may last for more than three years may last for less, it is in terms a tenancy from month to month.\nAnd Lord Justice Cotton says:\nHere the tenancy was to arise only in certain events which might happen (if at all) a very short time before the period of fourteen years (the period within which the principal with interest thereon was to be paid), when of necessity the mortgage must come to an end, I mean of necessity according to the contract between the parties.\nThe case, however, is chiefly valuable as further elucidating the principle of Ex parte Williams[50] and Ex parte Jackson[51], and as explaining the principle upon which the court proceeds when the question is whether a tenancy purported to be created by an attornment clause in a mortgage is intended to be a real tenancy at a rent reserved, or is, on the contrary, a mere sham for the purpose of giving the mortgagee in certain events, rights under the name of \u201crent\u201d which he could only exercise as a landlord, which, in reality, it was never intended he should be. Now, upon the above authorities it cannot, I think, be doubted, that in Morton v. Woods it would have been held that no tenancy whatever had been created between the parties, if it had not been for the passages above extracted and relied upon as showing the manifest intention of the parties to have been to create a tenancy at will, or at least for a period not requiring a deed. Notwithstanding that a term of ten years was mentioned in the manner in which it was, and that if the court had felt bound to construe the instruments as manifesting an express intention to create a tenancy for the term of ten years they would have held the instrument to be void as to the term under 8th and 9th Vic. ch. 106 sec. 8, and so that no tenancy had been created. By the statute of frauds it was expressly enacted that an instrument failing to take effect as a lease under that statute should operate as creating a tenancy at will, but there is no such provision in 8th and 9th Vic. ch. 106, or in the Ontario statute ch. 100 R.S.O. So that if an instrument fails of taking effect according to its expressed intent for non-conformity with the latter statutes, it cannot, contrary to such expressed intent, be construed as creating a tenancy of a wholly different character.\nApplying then the language of the Master of the Rolls in ex parte Voisey to the present case:\u2014\nWe must construe the deed before us according to the words used, we can only gather the intention of the parties from the words they use.\nWe must not construe it so as to contradict its express terms. Now the deed in which the clause under consideration appears is a mortgage in a printed form prepared by the Ontario Loan and Debenture Company for their own use in the case of all loans made by them. The language used in the clause is not that of the mortgagor as it is in case of an ordinary attornment clause whereby a mortgagor under his hand and seal attorns and becomes tenant to the mortgagees. The form adopted for the clause is such that by the mortgagees executing the deed it would operate as a lease and by their not executing it the clause would be simply inoperative, so that the mortgage without a letter added to the clause would in its printed form apply equally to a case in which there was an express agreement between the mortgagor and the mortgagees that the former should accept a lease from the latter for a term of years certain during which the principal should be expressed to be outstanding on the security of the mortgage paying as rent the instalments of principal and interest at the days and times on which they are made payable by the proviso; and to a case wherein there was no agreement or intention whatever that the relation of landlord and tenant should be created; all that was necessary to give effect to the intention of the parties in the former case was that the mortgagees should execute the mortgage deed, and in the latter that they should not. The clause states in express terms that\nThe mortgagees lease to the mortgagor the said lands from the date hereof until the date herein provided for the last payment of any of the moneys hereby secured, he the mortgagor paying therefor in every year during the said term on each and every of the days in the above proviso for redemption, appointed for payment of the moneys hereby secured, such rent or sum as equals in amount the amount payable on such days respectively according to the said proviso without any deduction.\nThis is the only language in the deed which intimates that either of the parties thereto had any intention that the relation of landlords and tenant, as well as that of mortgagees and mortgagor, should exist between the parties, and the language purports to be that of the mortgagees alone, and to manifest their express intention to be to create a term for the five years certain mentioned in the proviso for redemption in the mortgage. There is not a single expression in the deed which intimates any intention whatever that any term for any less period should be created, or which qualifies in the slightest degree the duration of the term, which is expressly alleged to be granted by the mortgagees. There is no provision for determining the term, either at the will of the mortgagees or of the mortgagor, or in any way whatever, save only the mode which is incident to, and usually inserted in, every demise, namely, forfeiture for non-payment of rent or non-fulfilment of covenants. The term so purported to be granted, if well granted, that is to say, if the mortgage had been executed under the seal of the company, must have continued for the full term of the five years, unless forfeited for non\u2011payment of rent. This is what the clause expresses, although, of course, a question as to its validity upon the ground of the objection taken in ex parte Williams would be still open. A question not unnaturally, perhaps, arises here. What object could the company have had in omitting from the printed form of mortgage, the 15th clause contemplated by the act respecting short forms of mortgages to be used in mortgages made in pursuance of the act, while declaring the mortgage to be executed in pursuance of the act, and inserting in its stead the clause under consideration? The answer seems to me to be clear, and to show that what the company intended was the creation of a demise for a term of years to be granted by them under their corporation seal whenever the relation of landlord and tenant should be agreed upon, namely, that it was because of the division in this court in the case of The Trust and Loan Company v. Lawrason[52]. In that case three of the judges of this court were of opinion that the 15th clause in the form of mortgage set out in the schedule to the act respecting short forms of mortgages did create the relation of landlord and tenant between the mortgagees and the mortgagor, while three on the contrary, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, were of opinion, that it did not\u2014that there was no rent reserved\u2014and that, therefore, the mortgagees had no claim under the statute of Ann, upon a seizure made of the mortgagor\u2019s chattels upon the mortgaged premises under execution at the suit of his creditors; and the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario to that effect stood. It was doubtless in consequence of the result of this case that The Ontario Loan and Debenture Company resolved to discard the 15th clause in the short form of mortgage adopted by the act, and to adopt in its stead the clause now under consideration in all their mortgages in such a form that when the mortgage should be executed by the company it should take effect, and when the mortgage should not be executed by the company the clause should be merely inoperative; and expressed in the ordinary terms of a lease evecuted by a landlord to a tenant for a fixed term at a rent reserved, so that when the relation of landlord and tenant was in reality agreed upon, and the mortgage should therefore be executed by the company, there should be no possibility of doubt as to their having granted a lease to the mortgagor for a fixed term at a rent reserved. That the relation of landlord and tenant was not agreed upon, or intended to be created, or deemed necessary in the present case, may well be inferred not only from the fact that the mortgagees did not execute the mortgage, but also from the fact that a large part of the mortgaged premises was, at the time of the execution of the mortgage, in possession of tenants of the mortgagor at an annual rent exceeding the several instalments except the last of the principal and interest made payable under the terms of the proviso for redemption in the mortgage, the benefit of which rents the mortgagees in case of default by the mortgagor could obtain without the creation of the relation of landlords and tenant between the mortgagees and mortgagor by entering into possession under the terms of the mortgage and giving notice to the tenants; and from this further fact that the mortgagees never assumed to exercise a landlord\u2019s right of distress for the instalment which fell due on the 1st of June, 1886, and remained in arrears for more than twelve months, nor for the instalment which fell due on the 1st December, 1886, and remained in arrear for more than six months, nor although the mortgagor\u2019s chattels on the mortgaged premises were seized in the month of March, 1887, under executions issued at the suit of some of his creditors do they appear to have asserted any claim at landlords until their present claim was made upon the 8th June, 1887, after the seizure made on or about the first of that month under the execution issued at the suit of the appellants. There is no foundation, in my opinion, for the contention that the mortgage operates as creating a tenancy at will between the mortgagees and the mortgagor indeed to hold the mortgagor in the present case to have been in possession of the mortgaged premises as tenant at will of the mortgagees, and so subject to eviction before default, would be to hold contrary to the plain intent of the parties as expressed in the instrument, would be to contradict the instrument and not to construe it. Applying, then, the judgment in Morton v. Woods to the very different state of facts existing here; in order that the relation of landlord and tenant should have been created at law between the mortgagees and the mortgagor by the mortgage in the frame in which it is, it should have been executed by the mortgagees. It is contended, however, that although the mortgage by reason of its not having been executed by the mortgagees may fail to take effect as creating a legal demise by the mortgagees to the mortgagor for the term of years expressed, it can nevertheless be construed to be a valid executory agreement for a lease for the term of the five years, capable of being enforced at the suit of the mortgagees by a bill in equity for specific performance, and that, therefore, since the Judicature Act the mortgagees are entitled to the same benefit as if the mortgage had been executed by them with their corporate seal.\nWalsh v. Lonsdale[53] and Allhusen v. Brooking[54], were cited in support of this contention, and other cases. In Walsh v. Lonsdale, a person had been let into premises as tenant under an executory agreement in writing, within the provisions of the statute of frauds, signed by both the landlord and tenant for a lease for the term of seven years. By the executory agreement it was provided that the rent to be reserved in the lease was to be made payable yearly in advance, and the question was whether the rent could be distrained for in advance before the lease was actually executed? The contention of the tenant was that until the lease should be executed granting the term for the seven years he was in possession only as tenant from year to year, and that the executory agreement, under which he was let into possession, although enforceable in equity, did not operate as a present demise, and that distress was a legal remedy, are daily applicable to a legale state. The court, however, held that a tenant holding under an agreement, for a lease of which specific performance would be decreed stands in the same position as to liability as if the lease had been executed, and that since the Judicature Act, every branch of the court must now give him the same rights.\nJessel, Master of the Rolls, giving judgment says:\nThere is an agreement for a lease under which possession has been given. Now, since the Judicature Act the possession is held under the agreement. There are not two estates as there were formerly. One estate at common law, by reason of the payment of rent, from year to year, and an estate in equity under the agreement. There is only one court and the equity rules prevail in it. The tenant holds under an agreement for a lease. He holds, therefore, under the same terms in equity as if a lease had been granted, it being a case in which both parties admit that relief is capable of being given by specific performance, That being so he cannot complain of the exercise by the landlord of the same rights as the landlord would have had if the lease had been granted.\nIn that case there was no question as to the fact of the person in possession of the premises being in such possession as tenant, under an agreement in writing, executed within the provisions of the statute of frauds, the right to have which specifically performed by a lease executed in the terms of the executory agreement was admitted by both parties, and all these points were relied upon by the Master of the Rolls as the basis of his judgment. It is sufficient to say that the difference between that case and the present is so obvious as not to admit of its application as governing a case like the present.\nIn Allhusen v. Brooking the point decided simply was that, upon the true construction of the instrument in that case under consideration, the word \u201cvested,\u201d as used therein, was not limited to an actual legal vesting under a lease in possession, but included an equitable vesting of the right in question under an agreement for a lease. Walsh v. Lonsdale was referred to, it is true, but as deciding merely that a person in possession as tenant, under an executory agreement for a lease, of which specific performance would be granted, holds, under the same terms, in equity as if a lease in accordance with the terms of the executory agreement had been granted.\nThen there is the case of Stratton v. Pettit, decided in 1855. There, by articles of agreement between A. and B., it was witnessed that A. agreed to let and B. agreed to take certain premises in possession for the term of five years on certain specified terms, and A. agreed to sell and B. agreed to purchase the demised premises at the end of the term. In an action by A. against B., for non-fulfilment by him of a part of the agreement to be performed on his part, the defence was that the agreement purported to be a lease of land for a term of five years and that it was void as not being under seal. Jarvis C.J., delivering the judgment of the court, says[55]:\nThe question in this case is whether the instrument set forth in the declaration is a lease or an agreement. If it is a lease it is void by the statute 8 and 9 Vic. ch. 106 sec. 3, and the defendant is entitled to judgment; if it is an agreement it is not within the statute and the plaintiff will succeed. It was admitted during the argument that the instrument would have been a lease if it had been made before the statute, but it was contended that it ought, since the passing of the act, to be held to be an agreement only, because if it is a lease it is void and it could not have been the intention of the parties to make a void instrument. The rule to be collected from all the cases is that the intention of the parties as declared by the words of the instrument must govern the construction. The question then is, what was the intention of the parties when the instrument was made? Doubtless they intended to make an instrument which should have some operation; bat did they intend to make a lease or an agreement? If the former, they have not done what they intended, because the lease is void by the statute. The intention of the parties must be collected from the instrument itself.\nThe rule is well explained, he says, in Morgan v. Bissell[56], as follows:\u2014\nWhen there is an instrument by which it appears that one party is to give possession and the other to take it, that is a lease unless it can be collected from the instrument itself that it is an agreement only for a lease to be afterwards made\nThen he proceeds:\u2014\nIt is admitted that before the statute this instrument would have been held to be a lease, and if the true rule would be that the intention of the parties as declared by the words of the instrument must govern the construction, it is clear that the parties intended this instrument to operate as a lease. It is void as a lease and therefore the defendant is intitled to our judgment.\nThen there is the case of Pain v. Coombe in 1857[57]. That was a case of a Bill in Equity filed by a tenant in possession of premises for specific performance of an agreement for a lease made under the following circumstances: The plaintiff and defendant in the presence of a third person (a land agent and surveyor) orally agreed upon all the terms of the proposed lease, and the defendant then directed the plaintiff and such third person to instruct a Mr. Hodding, a solicitor, to reduce the terms so agreed upon to writing. Mr. Hodding did so, and afterwards converted a rough draft first made by him into a fair draft agreement which he sent to the defendant, who afterwards let the plaintiff into possession, and afterwards directed Mr. Hodding to prepare a lease in conformity with such draft agreement. Mr. Hodding prepared the lease accordingly, but the defendant refused to execute it and gave the plaintiff notice to quit, who thereupon filed his bill for specific performance. The case was one founded not upon an agreement signed within the statute of frauds, but upon the equitable doctrine of performance; taking the case out of the operation of the statute of frauds. I make an extract from the judgment of the Lord Chancellor on the case in appeal from the report in 3 Jur. N.S. 847, as being more full than that in 1 DeG. and Jones. At p. 848 he says, and in this his judgment, the Lords Justices concurred:\nI confess that looking to this case merely upon the evidence before me I have not the smallest hesitation in coming as a juror to the conclusion that Mr. Coombs put Mr. Pain into possession on the 3rd of January, having in his hand the document B, and that he meant to say, therefore, \u201ctake possession upon the terms of the articles of that agreement.\u201d If I am asked why I came to that conclusion, It appears to me to follow irresistibly from a fair attention to what the witnesses say. I am not going through the evidence of Mr. Ewer, the surveyor, but speaking of the meeting which took place on the 24th October, between himself, the plaintiff and the defendant, he says, expressly: \u201cthe terms of letting were definitely settled and agreed upon between the plaintiff and the defendant at the interview, and it was also agreed upon (this appears to be important) between the plaintiff and defendant, that the plaintiff and himself should instruct Mr. Hodding to commit the terms to writing and prepare a formal agreement for a lease according to them, accordingly on the following day, he, (Mr. Ewer) with the plaintiff, went to Mr. Hodding, and by their instructions Mr. Hodding took down the memorandum marked A. Then what says Mr. Hodding: Mr. Hodding says he was to prepare a formal agreement for both parties. Mr. Hodding appears to be solicitor ordinarily for the plaintiff, but for this purpose Mr. Combs desired him to act for him also. He says, having received these statements which induced him to draw out these heads called exhibit A a day or two afterwards he caused a draft agreement for a lease of the said farm to be prepared, being the draft agreement mentioned in the 7th paragraph of the bill, exhibit B, which he sent to the defendant. Now, I infer from Mr. Ewer\u2019s evidence that it certainly was not the intention of Mr. Coombs to act in so hasty and unguarded a manner as to put Pain in possession until he had before him in writing the terms upon which the possession was to be taken, and those instructions having been conveyed to Mr. Hodding, he prepared first of all in a rough way the exhibit A, then in a more formal way exhibit B, and sends that agreement to the defendant. It is said there is no proof when he got it\u2014that appears to be so, but when he says he prepared it two or three days afterwards and sent it to him, the natural and almost irresistible inference is, that he means he sent it to him then and there immediately, or within a day or two afterwards, and when we find Mr. Coombs a couple of months afterwards put Mr. Pain into possession, and some months afterwards desires a lease to be prepared according to that agreement, the inference, to my mind, is irresistible, that he had the agreement before him.\nAnd again:\nThis (the agreement, exhibit B) is put into his (Mr. Coomb\u2019s) hands, and with that he puts Mr. Pain into possession. That appears to be the solution of this case, and, therefore, upon the terms of that paper Mr. Coombs is bound to grant a lease. Mr. Fry, in his work on specific performance, sec. 577, refers to this case simply as an illustration of the equitable doctrine that\nthe acknowledged possession of a stranger in the land of another is not explicable except on the supposition of an agreement, and has therefore, constantly been received as evidence of an antecedent contract.\nBetween that case and the present there is such an obvious difference as to divest Pain v. Coombs and the above doctrine which it illustrates from all application in the present case.\nIn Parker v. Taswell[58], an agreement for a lease which contained all the conditions of the proposed letting was signed by an agent of the person named as lessor and by the proposed tenant, under this agreement the tenant had been let into possession of the premises, and the proposed landlord proceeded with the performance of certain acts which, by the agreement, were to be performed on his part, but differences having arisen between him and the tenant, he brought an action of ejectment against the tenant, who filed his bill for specific performance.\nThe contention of the defendant was that the agreement was expressed in terms that before the statute 8 and 9 Vic. ch. 106 sec. 3, would have been sufficient to operate as a present demise, and that it must therefore, be regarded as a lease and void by the statute as not being under seal. In fact the contention was that it was not a lease because it was not under seal, but, that, as it was expressed in terms sufficient before the statute to operate as a present demise, it should be held to be a lease upon the authority of Stretton v. Pettit for the purpose of making it void under the statute. Stuart V.C. would not listen to this contention, but granted a decree for specific per- formance holding the agreement to be as it was in its terms a good agreement in equity for a lease.\nUpon appeal, Lord Chancellor Lord Chelmsford giving judgment[59], says:\u2014\nOn the part of the defendant it is insisted that this document was intended for a lease, and that, therefore, if it is void for that purpose it cannot be used as an agreement. The case of Stretton v. Pettit is cited in support of that argument. That case, however, is merely an authority to show that the intention of the parties to be collected from the language of the instrument was that it should take effect as a lease, and that it was void as such by the third section of the 8th and 9th Vic. c. 106, not being by deed. But the instrument now in question could not amount to a lease, because it was not signed by an agent lawfully authorised by writing, nor was it signed in the name of the principal so as to render it a lease binding upon the lessor.\nThen he adds:\u2014\nAssuming, however, that it had been signed in the name of the lessor, and would, therefore, have amounted to a lease as containing words of present demise. Yet there is nothing in the Act to prevent its being used as an agreement though void as lease because not under seal. The legislature appears to have been very cautious and guarded in language, for it uses the expression \u201cshall be void at law\u201d\u2014that is as a lease. If the Legislature had intended to deprive such a document of all efficiency it would have said that the instrument should be \u201cvoid to all intents and purposes.\u201d There are no such words in the Act. I think it would be too strong to say that because it is void at law as a lease it cannot be used as an agreement enforceable in equity, the intention of the parties having been that there should be a lease, and the aid of equity being only invoked to carry that intention into effect.\nThe learned chancellor thus appears to refer to the principle involved in Stretton v- Pettit to show that it was not a decision in support of the contention of the defendant on whose behalf it was cited. The above remarks of the learned chancellor amount simply to this, that assuming the instrument to have been signed by the lessor as required by the statute of frauds expressed in such terms as to have constituted a good lease within the Statute of Frauds, prior to the passing of 8th and 9th Vic. ch. 106 sec. 3, it would be plain that the intention of the parties was that there should be a lease, and to give effect to that intention as by reason of 8th and 9th Vic., the instrument could not operate as a lease, equity would treat the instrument to be an agreement for a lease of which character it was not deprived by 8th and 9th Vic. ch. 106, and, therefore, upon such an instrument so signed, the court could, in aid of the intention of the parties, decree a lease to be executed in accordance with the terms of the instrument. That, however, is far from being an authority that (although neither is this the case before us), a verbal agreement for a lease and possession given thereunder, and so not capable of being enforced under the provisions of the statute of frauds, but enforceable in the discretion of the court according to the circumstances appearing in each particular case, in despite of the statute, is, since the Judicature Act, any more than it was before an actual lease, within the provisions of the statute 8th Anne ch. 14, so as to enable the alleged lessor to invoke the provisions of the statute after the goods of the party in possession have been seized at suit of his judgment creditors. When such a case arises it will be time enough to determine whether Walsh v. Lonsdale applies to it. In the present case the possession of the party sought to be declared to have been a tenant of the Ontario Loan and Debenture Company, at a rent reserved, is attributable to his title as mortgagor and owner of the equity of redemption in fee of the mortgaged premises, upon which the mortgagees by the 7th and 14th clauses of the mortgage, as they are extended in the act respecting short forms of mortgages, were duly empowered to enter in the event of default being committed by the mortgagor in payment of any of the instalments of principal and interest at the times in that behalf mentioned in the proviso for redemption.\nThere is not a tittle of evidence that in point of fact it had ever been agreed upon by the mortgagor that the relation of landlord and tenant in addition to that of mortgagees and mortgagor should exist between the parties. If it had been so agreed upon, and if at a rent, equal to the instalments payable under the proviso for redemption as expressed in the printed form of mortgage in use by the company, they could, and no doubt would, have executed the mortgage which, as I have already shown, contained a printed clause so framed as to be able to take effect as a lease, if that had been agreed upon by the mortgagees executing the mortgage, and so as to remain inoperative by the mortgagees not executing it when the creation of the relation of landlord and tenant had not been agreed upon. In the present case they have not executed the mortgage, nor have they offered any explanation why they did not do so when, if the relation had been agreed upon, they would, by executing it, have so easily given effect to such agreement.\nBut if the mortgage had been executed by the mortgagees the case must, in my opinion be governed by ex parte Williams, ex parte Jackson, and the principle expounded in ex parte Voisey. The learned judge who tried the case was of opinion that he must have so held, if he was obliged to take into consideration the amount made payable as the rent for the last half year of the term, amounting to upwards of $16,000, and in that opinion I entirely concur for in such case the sum made payable during the term of five years and expressed to be for rent would be just $26,212.50. It needs no argument that such an amount would be so monstrously excessive that it never could have been intended to become payable as rent for the use and occupation of the land during the term even if the mortgagor had been in the actual occupation of the whole of the lands in the mortgage. That was an amount which no ordinary tenant\u2014\nWould be willing to pay for the use and occupation under ordinary circumstances.\nIt would not be a real rent, but a payment of the instalments secured by the mortgage under the fictitious name of rent.\nThe mere nominal creation of the relation of landlord and tenant for the purpose of the mortgagees trying to get the benefit which a real landlord alone could have over any other creditor of the mortgagor without any intention of creating the relation of landlord and tenant in reality.\nNow that the whole amount of the $16,042.50, purported to be made payable as rent for the last half year of the term, must be taken into consideration for the purpose of determining a question as to the actual intention which the parties had in introducing into the mortgage deed, a clause purporting to create the tenancy as well as the whole of the period named for the duration of the term expressed to be created must be taken into consideration, cannot in my opinion, admit of any doubt whatever; the questions being whether the term itself and the tenancy expressed to be created during its continuance was not a mere sham, and whether the amount expressed to be reserved as rent during the term was not so excessive as to demonstrate the tenancy to be a sham, and that no real tenancy was intended it is impossible to read the clause purporting to grant one single term of a fixed duration as creating several terms for distinct shorter periods than the one named, for the purpose of showing that the moneys payable during such shorter periods which are, in fact, but parts of the one term granted, would be fair and reasonable sums to be reserved as rent. That would be to make a wholly new contract for the parties which they themselves had never contemplated making, not to construe their intention as appearing on the contract which they did make. No doubt, there might be a bon\u00e2 fide rent of varying amount reserved, payable in each year during the term, but to arrive at the intention of the parties in naming in the mortgage deed the period for the duration of the term and the amount payable as rent in each year during the term, it is impossible to exclude from consideration any portion of the period named for the duration of the term or any portion of the sums expressed to be payable as rent during its continuance. The case of Kitching v. Hicks[60] upon which the learned judge proceeded has no application to the present case. There it was held that an instrument by way of chattel mortgage of certain goods and stock in trade and of certain book debts of a debtor contained two distinct contracts, and that the deed passed the book debts as to which it was held that registration was not necessary, although as to the goods and stock in trade the mortgage failed to take effect for want of registration. That is a different thing from cutting up a single term expressed by the contract of the parties to be created, but not so created as to be effectual and valid in law, into several minor terms at distinct rents, and which, by such process of dissection, should be made valid in the interest of one of the parties without any consent of the other. For all of the above reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and that judgment should be ordered to be entered in the court below for the defendents in the interpleader issue.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The reality of the tenancy between the mortgagor and the defendant company depends in the first place on the sufficiency of the lease as a matter of conveyancing, and in the next place on the bon\u00e2 fides of the transaction.\nThe latter point has usually been tested in England in the light of the bankruptcy law. Here we have no bankruptcy law at present, but it does not therefore follow that the intention with which the lease is made is to be disregarded. Creditors may be taken advantage of in other ways than those expressly forbidden by the bankruptcy laws, and the right to challenge one of these leases is not confined to creditors. Some of the ordinary incidents of the relation of landlord and tenant are fitted to produce injustice, and the person affected by them must have the right to question the reality of the relationship. A notable example is the right to distrain the goods of a stranger, which still exists in Ontario though modified by statute, R.S.O. 1887, ch. 102, s. 16, 17.\nKearsley v. Philips[61] is an instance of the exercise of that right under the attornment clause in a mortgage, and in the case Re Willis[62] one of the lords justices refers to that power as a reason why an attornment is more beneficial to a mortgagee than a mere power to enter and distrain.\nIt cannot be denied that a mortgagor competent to contract will be bound by whatever bargain he voluntarily makes with his mortgagee, and, in attorning tenant to him, may, if he please, agree to pay him rent at a higher rate than a stranger would be likely to give for the premises, but when the question is whether there is an honest intention to create the relationship of landlord and tenant, or whether a tenancy is ostensibly created in order to cover some other purpose, we can properly, and without interfering with the freedom of contract, consider the terms of the lease as a part of the evidence bearing on the fact of intention. On the question of conveyancing the deed differs from, I think, all of those on which the English cases which have been cited were decided, by not giving the mortgagees a right to immediate possession. There is not the old redemise clause which provided in direct terms for the mortgagor retaining possession until default, but there are equivalent stipulations. There is a proviso that the mortgagees, on default of payment for one month, may, on one month\u2019s notice, enter on and lease or sell the lands. That is the statutory short form, and a modification is added dispensing with notice if the default lasts three months. This is quite inconsistent with a right in the mortgagees to enter before default. A mortgage similar in this respect was before the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Ontario, in Superior Loan and Saving Society v. Lucas[63] in 1879. That was an action of ejectment in which the society, failing to establish a default on the part of the mortgagor, sought to recover possession of the land because of the absence of the formal re-demise. The court held that notwithstanding the omission of the re-demise clause, it sufficiently appeared from the provisions of the mortgage itself and the rules and regulations of the plaintiff company, that it was the intention of the parties that the defendant should retain possession until default. I think that decision was correct. It would be so a fortiori under the rules of equity which prevail since the passing of the Judicature Act.\nThere is in the clause which is relied on as a lease, and which has inaccurately been spoken of as an attornment clause, another proviso:\nProvided always, and it is agreed, that in case any of the covenants or agreements herein of the mortgagor, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, be untrue, or be unobserved or broken at any time, the mortgagees, their successors or assigns, may, without any previous demand or notice, enter on the saids lands or any part thereof in the name of the whole, and take and retain possession thereof and determine the said lease.\nThe term is described in the clause as from the date of the deed until the date therein provided for the last payment of any of the moneys thereby secured, or in other words, for five years.\nIt cannot see any grounds for holding it to be at will.\nIt is not unusual in England, though very unusual in this country, to give a mortgagee the right to immediate possession. The right was not given I believe in some of the cases which have been discussed on the argument, e.g., Ex parte Williams and Ex parte Voisey[64], but it was given by the deed in question in Morton v. Woods[65], and the effect may be concisely expressed by borrowing the words of Cockburn C.J.:\nThe primary object of the parties was to secure to the mortgagees the amplest remedies to enforce the repayment of the mortgage money and interest, and though the term of ten years is mentioned, it was intended, on the one hand, that the mortgagees should be fully empowered to turn the mortgagor out at any moment, and so to realise their security by sale, while, on the other hand, the mortgagor should be empowered to get rid of his tenancy by paying off the mortgage money.\nHere, as I have shown, the mortgagors were not empowered to turn out the mortgagor at any time, and the utmost privilege accorded to the mortgagor, in the way of paying off, was the right to pay $100, or any multiple of $100 not exceeding $1,000, in advance, on the day of the date of any half-yearly payment.\nThe lease, then, being for upwards of three years, is required to be in writing by the statute of frauds, and is void at law for not being by deed under the Ontario statute[66].\nIt has been suggested that the position and rights of the parties to this deed may be explained, and the right of the mortgagee to distrain maintained, on the ground that the deed contains an agreement for a lease, and that on doctrines of equity, the mortgagor must be regarded as holding under the same terms as if a lease had been granted; and some cases have been referred to in which that doctrine has been recently applied to agreements for leases. Swain v. Ayers[67], per Lord Esher; In re Maughan[68], per Field J.; Walsh v. Lonsdale[69], per Jessel M.R., and other cases.\nIt may be that this deed contains an agreement for a lease. I am not sure that it does; but assuming that it does, I am not prepared to hold without more direct authority than is furnished by the cases cited, that the enactment of the Judicature Act[70], that in matters in which there is any conflict or variance between the rules of equity and the rules of the common law with reference to the same matter, the rales of equity shall prevail, has so completely done away with distinction between a lease and an agreement for a lease, as to render lands which are the subject of an agreement only \u201clands or tenements which are or shall be leased for life or lives, term of years, at will, or otherwise,\u201d which are the words of the statute. Nor do I see my way to hold that there has been any attornment by the mortgagor. The clause in the deed is not in form an attornment. In every one of the late precedents which have been brought to our attention the mortgagor \u201cdoth attorn tenant,\u201d except only ex parte Voisey[71], and in that case he covenants to become tenant upon a certain event. In every case he is the person who speaks. Here it is the mortgagee who purports to lease. It has been said that there is an attornment to be found in the words: \u201cHe, the mortgagor, paying, &c.,\u201d in this passage from the lease:\nAnd the mortgagees lease to the mortgagor the said lands from the date hereof until the date herein provided for the last payment of any moneys hereby secured, undisturbed by the mortgagees or their assigns, he, mortgagor, paying therefor in every year during the said term, on each and every of the days in the above proviso for redemption appointed for payment of moneys hereby secured, such rent or sum as equals in amount the amount payable on such days respectively according to the said proviso, without any deduction.\nI understand the argument to be that this is a covenant by the mortgagor to pay the rent, just as, in an ordinary lease, a covenant by the lessee is involved in the reddendum, \u201cyielding and paying, &c.,\u201d and that the agreement to pay rent is an attornment. A case is cited, Cannock v. Jones[72], where the doctrine that no technical words are necessary to constitute a covenant was illustrated in an action by a tenant against his lessor, the words held to be a covenant being \u201cthe farm-house and buildings being previously put in repair and kept in repair by the said Elizabeth Jones.\u201d\nI am afraid the reasoning is more subtle than sound. \u201cHe, the mortgagor, paying therefor in every year during the said term, &c.,\u201d is the reddendum \u201cyielding and paying, etc.\u201d Debt for rent, or covenant, lay from early times on this word \u201cyielding.\u201d See note 2 under Thursby v. Plant[73]. But you cannot detach the words \u201cyielding, &c.,\u201d from the habendum, and tenendum. It is only in connection with the grant by the lessor that it has the force of a covenant. The rule is shortly laid down in Bush v. Coles[74]:\nThat upon a reservation an action of covenant will lie, as where rent is reserved covenant will lie upon the words of reservation without any expressed words of covenant.\nThat is a different thing from implying a covenant where, as in this case, there is no reservation and no demise.\nThe divisional court decided this case on the one ground, that what was done was not sufficient to create the relationship of landlord and tenant. My opinion is that that decision is correct. I do not feel pressed by any of the English decisions, because I think they turn on facts that differ radically from those presented in this case. I have given the general views in which my opinion inclines to the conclusion reached by the divisional court rather than that of the Court of Appeal. I believe I am in substantial accord with my brother Gwynne, whose exhaustive and elaborate judgment I have seen; and I should have to give effect to my opinion by holding that the appeal should be allowed. Still I should not do so without some feeling of want of certainty on more than one point. But, if the conveyancing difficulty were surmounted, I should hold without hesitation that there was no reality in the alleged tenancy.\nThe question is one of fact.\nThe learned judge who tried the action did not, and properly felt that he could not, sustain the lease as a whole; but he satisfied himself that he was at liberty to separate the last instalment of rent from the others, and then finding that each instalment of those due before the sheriff seized was reasonable in relation to the value of the land, he held that the landlord was entitled to recover in respect of the two of the reasonable instalments which were all that were claimed for. This mode of disposing of the matter must have been taken in misapprehension of what was the question to be tried, a misapprehension that may easily have been induced by the form of the issue, which if an interpleader at the instance of the sheriff, as I suppose it to be, is a mistaken proceeding. The right of a landlord under the statute of Anne is to have the goods remain on the premises until the execution creditor pays the rent which is due, not exceeding a year\u2019s rent. He is not entitled to have the rent paid out of the money realized by the sheriff from the sale under the execution, although in practice there may usually be a tacit understanding that it will be paid by the sheriff out of that money. Under the statute there is no question between the sheriff and the landlord in respect to that money, and the issue on the record ought to be found against the plaintiffs without any regard to the question of tenancy which is the whole subject of the contest.\nIt is not possible, and if it were possible it would not be advisable to attempt, to formulate all the considerations by which the reality and honesty of one of these leases may be tested. It is a question of fact in each case, and you cannot satisfactorily try facts by formulas. The enquiry in the present case turns, as must be the case in the bulk of these mortgage cases, to a great extent on the amount of rent reserved. We may in conducting that inquiry usefully keep in view some general observations made by Lord Justice Baggallay in Ex parte Jackson[75] which commend themselves to me as accurate in principle. \u201cSo far,\u201d the Lord Justice remarked, \u201cas any inference can be drawn from the practice of inserting attornment clauses, it appears to me that the benefit to be derived by the attornment clause was intended to be an equivalent for that which the mortgagee would derive from the rent if the tenant had been a stranger. What would that equivalent be? Would it not be a right to the payment of a fair and reasonable rent, such as an ordinary tenant would be willing to give for the property under ordinary circumstances? That, as it seems to me, is the rent for which a properly prepared attornment clause should make provision; not necessarily the exact amount which a tenant would pay for the property, but such an amount as a willing tenant would probably pay as a bon\u00e2 fide rent. If the rent so reserved is clearly in excess of what would be a fair and reasonable rent, it appears to me that, though you may call it a rent, it is no longer a real rent, but a fictitious payment under the name of rent.\u201d\nI adopt that criterion, and it may be applied without in the least trenching on the right of the parties to make what contracts they please. The question is have they made a real contract by which the one intends to become tenant to the other, or is the object to give the mortgagee in addition to the security upon the land (which, as a rule, is all the security stipulated for in the application and agreement for these loans, read apart from the printed form of mortgage), the power to distrain, not for a reasonable rent, for that would be consistent with good faith, but for an amount which may give the mortgagee an undue advantage, in respect of the personal property on the land, over execution creditors of the mortgagor, and even enable him to obtain payment out of the goods of a stranger.\nIn this case the principal money secured by the mortgage is $20,000 and it bears seven per cent. interest. The payments are half-yearly for five years from the first day of December, 1883, to the first day of June, 1888. Each six months down to the first of December, 1887, five hundred dollars of principal and interest on the unpaid principal are payable, making the half\u2011yearly payments something over $2,000, the amounts diminishing each half year by the amount of half a year\u2019s interest on five hundred dollars\nThese are payments within the fair annual value of the property, and if the whole had been of the same amount no inference unfavourable to the reality of the transaction could have been drawn from the amount of rent reserved, but the remaining payment of $15,500 of principal with half a year\u2019s interest on that sum, making upwards of $16,000, is considerably over four times the most extravagant estimate. It is impossible to hold that a lease on those terms was arranged with the honest purpose of creating a real tenancy. It is simply incredible. To divide the payments, as was done in the court of first instance, and say that some may stand while it is out of the question to sustain others, is to lose sight of the object of the inquiry. We are not concerned with the reasonableness of this instalment or that as a demand by the mortgagee against the mortgagor, or in relation to the lettable value of the property. The question is the design with which the alleged lease was made, and we look at its terms as part of the evidence upon that question of fact. The right of parties to a mortgage to constitute between themselves the relation of landlord and tenant, with a view to the greater security of the mortgagee or the more convenient realization of the mortgage moneys, is now undoubted, and every reasonable presumption should be made in favour of the bon\u00e2 fides of what they profess to do. But while we may go, as seems to have been done in at least one of the reported English cases, as far as credulity can reach, we must not put these transactions on a plane entirely above the practical business of real life. If we find that the lease which is set up by a mortgagee as taken from him by his mortgagor is one which, after every allowance and consideration in its favor, obviously would never have been entered into by any person as a business transaction of letting and hiring, there need be no hesitation in concluding that the object was not the creation of a real tenancy. I repeat that that is the question. A mortgagor is at perfect liberty to agree that the mortgagee may distrain for all the mortgage moneys, principal as well as interest, without any regard to the value of the land, and whether the goods are on the mortgaged premises or elsewhere. I believe that in Ontario this power is not fettered even by such safeguards for creditors as are provided in England by the Bills of Sale Act, 1878. See In re Willis[76]. It may also be said that, as far as liberty of contract is concerned, any one may contract to pay double its value for the house or farm he rents. But to have a legal right to do so is one thing, and intentionally to do so is a very different thing, and the difference is by no means unimportant to bear in mind when the motive of the ostensible transaction has to be inquired into.\nThere was some discussion in one of the courts below\u2014I am not sure that it was renewed before us\u2014upon the effect of the existence of leases of portions of the property at the time the mortgage was made. Nothing can turn on that subject if my views on the principal questions are correct. I have therefore thought it unnecessary to consider the subject. I think, however, that the doctrine of estoppel as applied in Ex parte Punnett[77] would preclude any question between the mortgagor and mortgagee.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the divisional court restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: George C.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong, Fournier, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nLandlord and tenant\u2014Verbal lease\u2014Expiration of\u2014Notice to quit\u2014Sub-tenancy\u2014Possession by sub-tenant after expiry of original lease.\nM. by verbal agreement leased certain premises to McC. who sublet a portion thereof. After the original tenancy expired, on November 15th, 1887, the sub-tenant remained in possession and in March, 1888, received a notice to quit from M. In June, 1888, M. issued a distress warrant to recover rent due for said premises from McC. and the sub-tenant paid the amount claimed as rent due from McC., but not from herself to McC. More than six months after the notice to quit was given proceedings were taken by M. to recover possession of the premises from the sub-tenant.\nHeld, that the notice to quit given to the sub-tenant, and the distress during the latter\u2019s possession on sufferance, did not work estoppel against the landlord as the tenancy had always been repudiated. (Fournier J. dissenting.)\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Divisional Court[2] by which the verdict for the defendants at the hearing was set aside.\nAn action was brought to recover possession of a cellar on the corner of Queen and Canal streets in the city of Ottawa, by Charles Magee, the owner of the property and the respondent in this case who, in September, 1882, verbally leased to one William McCaffrey, the premises in question, for a term to expire on November 15th, 1887, at $150 per annum. Subsequently McCaffrey to the knowledge of the respondent, in May, 1885, sublet the front part of the cellar known as \u201cbeer vaults\u201d to one John Gilmour, who afterwards with the consent of McCaffrey transferred his interest in the premises to Ada L. Gilmour, one of the appellants, and McCaffrey accepted her as his tenant on the same terms as those under which John Gilmour held the place.\nThe last payment of rent was made to McCaffrey on the 1st September, 1887. On the 1st December, 1887, A.L. Gilmour sent a cheque for rent to McCaffrey who declined to receive it and returned the cheque, his tenancy having expired on 15th November 1887.\nIn the latter part of November the plaintiff attempted without success to recover possession under the Overholding Tenants Act. Subsequently, on the 6th March, 1888, he gave the defendants notice \u201cto quit and deliver up the possession of the premises (describing them) which you now hold of me as tenants thereof on the 15th September next or at the expiration of the year of your tenancy which shall expire next after the end of one half year from the service of this notice.\u201d Both the defendants, however, disclaimed the plaintiff as their landlord, the defendant Ada Gilmour, whose agent the other defendant was, expressly saying when served with the notice that she did not know the plaintiff in the matter, that it was McCaffrey she dealt with.\nOn the 21st June plaintiff issued a distress warrant to distrain \u201cthe goods liable to be distrained for rent\u201d upon the premises in question which were described as \u201cnow or latterly in the tenure or occupation of William McCaffrey for the sum of $93.25 being rent due to me for the same on the 15th June, 1888, and for the purpose aforesaid distrain all such goods of the said William McCaffrey wheresoever they shall be found as have been carried off said premises but are liable by law to be distrained,\u201d etc. Upon this distress warrant a seizure was made and the defendants paid the rent demanded to the bailiff.\nIn November, 1888, the present action was brought and the defendants in answer thereto claimed that the lease being for more than three years and not in writing McCaffrey was a tenant from year to year of the plaintiff and having received no notice to quit his tenancy had not expired in November, 1888, when the action was brought. Further, that the issue of the distress warrant was an admission by the plaintiff of McCaffrey\u2019s tenancy.\nThe cause was heard before Mr. Justice Ferguson who held that plaintiff had no cause of action. This decision was reversed by the Divisional Court and the reversal affirmed by the Court of Appeal. In the proceedings in the latter courts another ground of defence was argued, namely, that defendants were themselves yearly tenants of the plaintiff, who was estopped from denying such tenancy by his notice to quit and distress warrant.\nBarry for the appellants cited the following cases: Pleasant v. Benson[3]; Graham v. Allsopp[4]; Doe d. Clark v. Smaridge[5].\nMcDonald Q.C. for the respondents referred to Pain v. Coombs[6]; Parker v. Taswell[7]; Walsh v. Lonsdale[8], Doe d. Tilt v. Stralton[9].\nSir W.J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014I think McCaffrey\u2019s tenancy expired at the end of 5 years and 2 months, viz., on the 15th of September, 1887, without any notice to quit or demand of possession, and that the tenancy of his sub-tenant, who only held for the residue of his term, expired at the same time. McCaffrey was allowed by Magee to continue in possession until 15th November, 1887, when he abandoned the premises. His continuance in possession after the termination of his lease was merely on sufferance. The defendants\u2019 rights ended with the termination of McCaffrey\u2019s tenancy on the 15th September, 1887, unless they can show that they subsequently acquired a right to continue in possession under Magee, for it is clear the defendants never became tenants of McCaffrey after the termination of his and their tenancy. They, no doubt, wished to do so, but he never in any way entered into any new arrangement with them. He refused to and did not accept any rent from them even for the broken period between the 1st of September and the 15th of November.\nI am inclined to think that the distress and payment of rent and notice to quit was a recognition of a tenancy from year to year after the expiration of the five years and two months, or on the 15th November, had defendants elected so to treat it and so to claim that their possession was lawful under Magee; if such had been the case they might, and I think would, have been entitled to a notice to quit, but instead of relying on any such tenancy they expressly disclaimed being Magee\u2019s tenants and repudiated him as their landlord, and, therefore, could not set up a want of notice to quit. Notwithstanding this disclaimer and repudiation, which would have rendered notice wholly unnecessary, they actually received due notice to quit from Magee on the 6th March, 1888, as he expresses it describing the property \u201cwhich you hold of me as tenant thereof on the 15th day of September next, or at the expiration of the year of your tenancy which shall expire next after the end of one-half year from the service of this notice.\u201d This action was not brought till the 30th November, 1888, so that whether the term commenced the 15th September or 15th November they received clear notice to quit.\nI think, taking the most favorable view of the appellants\u2019 case, this was all to which they were entitled and they have now no right to withhold from the owner the possession of this property.\nSTRONG J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed. It is clear that the appellants\u2019 sub-tenancy must have come to an end when the tenancy of their immediate landlord, McCaffrey, terminated, on the 15th of November, 1887. Therefore, the appellants in order to succeed must be able to show that something was done by the respondent to create a new tenancy subsequent to the expiration of McCaffrey\u2019s term. Two acts of the respondent are relied upon as creating a new tenancy by estoppel. First, it is said that on the 6th of March, 1888, the respondent gave the appellants a notice to quit in which he recognized them as being his tenants. It is clear that this was nothing more than an admission, which it is quite open to the respondent now to show that he made under the influence of error and mistake in the absence of any proof that the appellants adopted and acted upon it. So far from acting upon it the appellants repudiated it, Mrs. Gilmour expressly declaring, when served with the notice, that she had nothing to do with the appellant but held under McCaffrey.\nThen on the 21st June, 1888, the respondent issued a distress warrant against McCaffrey. This, as is pointed out by Mr. Osler in his judgment, may have been a wrongful act as regards McCaffrey, and I will add would possibly have been tortious as regards appellants also if their goods had been seized and sold under it. It is, however, out of the question to say that it raised an estoppel as between the respondent and the appellants, So far from adopting the act of the respondents as indicating a tenancy to the benefit of which they were entitled, they repudiated it and have all along insisted it was wrongful.\nOn the whole, for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Osler in the court below, the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be affirmed and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014Was of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This appeal must be, in my opinion, dismissed with costs. I cannot see why the proceedings which were instituted after the expiration of McCaffrey\u2019s lease in November, 1887, under the Overholding Tenant Act should not have prevailed, for as McCaffrey\u2019s term and right to possession terminated on the 15th November, 1887, it was his duty to surrender possession of the demised premises to his landlord freed from all let or hindrance of any person claiming under him, and if a sub-tenant of his refused to give up possession such conduct of the sub-tenant was surely an overholding by McCaffrey entitling the landlord to judgment in his proceedings under the Overholding Tenant Act. The defendants\u2019 right of possession, whatever may have been the terms of the sub-tenancy existing between them and McCaffrey, terminated on the 15th November, 1887, when McCaffrey\u2019s lease expired. This, too, was well known to the defendants, for McCaffrey upon the 1st December, 1887, refused to receive any rent from them because his lease had expired, and he no longer claimed any right of possession. The defendants\u2019 occupation then after the expiry of McCaffrey\u2019s lease was of their own wrong and as trespassers upon the plaintiff\u2019s property, and has so continued to be ever since. The plaintiff by issuing the distress warrant against McCaffrey in June, 1888, to obtain payment of rent as accrued subsequently to November, 1887, no doubt, if McCaffrey was the person in possession of the premises claiming title thereto, would have had the effect of giving to him by estoppel a new interest in the premises at least unto the end of the then current year, but McCaffrey claims no such interest; in point of fact he never has been in possession nor has he claimed to have had any right to the possession since the 15th November, 1887, and the defendants cannot, in the present action, claim any benefit from the estoppel which McCaffrey might have claimed had he been in possession. The defendants\u2019 possession at the time of the execution of the distress warrant in June, 1888, against McCaffrey was in no privity whatever with McCaffrey the privity which had existed between them and McCaffrey ceased, as they well knew or ought to have known, on the 15th November, 1887, when McCaffrey\u2019s lease terminated, and this subsequent possession was without a shadow of right, a trespass on the plaintiff\u2019s property. It was not a possession then under McCaffrey at all or in privity with him. Such a wrongful possession could give to the defendants no right to set up as annexed thereto the title by estoppel which McCaffrey might have relied upon if he had been claiming title to the possession in virtue of the execution of the distress warrant in June, 1888.\nThe conduct of the defendants, in my opinion, can not only not be justified by any principle of law, but has been vexatious in the extreme. The plaintiff seems to have been willing to regard them as his tenants subsequently to the expiration of McCaffrey\u2019s lease, and so regarding them in March, 1888, he gave them notice to quit at the expiration of the then cur- rent year. This notice they repudiated, insisting that they were not tenants of the plaintiff at all; they utterly deny having ever recognized him as their landlord. Well then they have placed themselves in this dilemma. They were either tenants of the plaintiff or they were not. If they were, their tenancy was duly determined by sufficient notice before the commencement of the present action. If they were not the plaintiff\u2019s tenants they continued to be what they were ever since the expiration of McCaffrey\u2019s lease on the 15th November, 1887, mere trespassers on the plaintiff\u2019s property without shadow of right, and so in June, 1888, when the distress warrant against McCaffrey was executed, not in a position to claim any privity with McCaffrey, whose interest had terminated in November, 1887, and who has not since claimed to have any interest in the premises. They cannot, therefore, insist by any defence to the present action that a new tenancy by estoppel had been created between McCaffrey and the plaintiff by the execution of the distress warrant against McCaffrey in June, 1888, and that such new tenancy had not been determined by any notice to quit given to McCaffrey.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014Concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellants: W.H.

Ritchie C.J. and Strong Founder, Gwynne and Patterson JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA, (APPEAL SIDE).\nElection law\u201438 Vic., (Q) s. 266; R.S.Q. art. 425\u2014Promissory note.\nS. (appellant's husband) through an action against St. L. Bros. on a promissory note for $4 000 a renewal of a note for same amount made by S. endorsed by him and handed to St. L. Bros., alleging that the original note had been made and discounted for the accommodation of St L Bro. The evidence showed that the proceeds of the note were paid over to one D., as agent for S., to be used as a portion of a provincial election fund controlled by S.\nHeld : affirming the judgment of the court below, that the plaintiff could not recover, even assuming a promise to pay on the part of St. L. Bros., the transaction being illegal under 38 Vic. c. 7 sec. 266 (P.Q.), now R. S. Q. art. 425, which makes void any contract, promise or undertaking, in any way relating to an election under the said act.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side) ([1]) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe facts and pleadings are fully stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Cross of the Queen's Bench as follows '.__\nBy this action instituted, 29th of May 1883, L. A. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal claims to recover from St. Louis Brothers $4,000, the amount of a promissory note dated the 26th July 1882, made and signed by L. A. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal himself, payable to his own order, and endorsed by him alleging in his declaration that it was (without his receiving any consideration or value) loaned by him as an accommodation to St Louis Brothers who endorsed and discounted it for their own profit, appropriating to themselves the proceeds thereof, and undertaking to pay it at maturity, having recognized their liability to do so, more especially to one J. M. Dufresne, and giving their check for the amount thereof on the 27th of July 1882, signed by Emmanuel St. Louis, one of them.\nTo this action, the Brothers St. Louis pleaded, denying generally the plaintiff's allegations, and answering that it was untrue that the note in question had been loaned to them, or given for their accommodation, or without consideration for it; that on the day it was transferred to them for their endorsement, it was L. A. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal\u2019s own debt; that they, St. Louis Brothers, got no value for it but only endorsed it for the benefit and advantage of him, L A. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal, who got the proceeds thereof when discounted; that the cheque was the personal affair of Emmanuel St. Louis one of the partners and was no acknowledgment of indebtedness by them who owed L. A. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal nothing and got no consideration for the cheque. Emmanuel St. Louis was wholly unauthorized to bind the partnership, which never acknowledged any liability or in any way authorized Emmanuel St. Louis to bind the firm.\nThat L. A. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal produced as exhibits, as well the promissory note in question, as a cheque for $4,000, on the bank of H\u00f4chelaga, dated the 27th July, 1882, payable to the order of J. M. Dufresne, signed E. St. Louis, with a protest at the instance of L. A. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal, dated the 13th September, 1883. L. A. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal claimed that had rendered services for the amount of the note to St. Louis Brothers, in procuring for them payment of their claim against the Provincial Government; 2nd. That is as settled for them a dispute they had with H. J. Beemer, contractor, getting the latter to retire from a partnership which had existed between them and J. H. Beemer, and paying for them $4,000, as a consideration for J. H. Beemer retiring from the partnership; 3rd. That the note was given to pay a subscription by the St. Louis Brothers to an election fund of which L. A. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal had the administration.\nThe first two grounds were unsupported by the evidence; as to the second, it was proved that the $4,000 given to H. J. Beemer, as a bonus, in consideration for his retiring from a contract, was provided for by St. Louis Brothers themselves.\nWith regard to the third ground, the two brothers, partners of the firm of St. Louis & Fr\u00e8re, were both examined; neither of them admitted that the original note or renewals, were either of them, given for their accommodation; on the contrary, they persist in saying that what they had to do with the transaction was for the accommodation of L. A. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal, Jean-Baptiste St. Louis explains that he had little to do with the transaction, somewhat when the original note was delivered to him by Dufresne he took it over to the Hochelaga Bank, returned with the proceeds which he handed to J. M. Dufresne for L. A. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal or rather laid the money on the table, so that he might get it. Emmanuel St. Louis, who seems to have been the negotiator, corroborated his brother's story about the discount, and stated that he handed the money to J. M. Dufresne for L. A. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal. He admitted that he signed the cheque for $4,000, but denied that he had anything to do with the transaction involved in this suit. He explained that the $4000 was to be given to L A. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal as a bonus in consideration of his procuring to St. Louis Brothers the payment, by the Government, of a claim for $25,575, which they were then making for damages and extras, under their contract with the Government for the construction of the workshops of the North Shore Railway, L. A. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal being at the time Government superintendent of the said railway and acting as referee to whom the Government had submitted the claim of the St. Louis Brothers, for his report. The cheque, he says, was his personal affair, and in no way bound the firm, from whom he had no authority in the matter, and allowed to the extent of $19000 he did not consider himself bound to pay the cheque, his promise being conditional that the claim should be allowed and paid in full. In this respect he is to some extent corroborated by J. M. Dufresne.\nJ. M. Dufresne who acted as intermediary and agent of L. A. S\u00e9necal, explained that the note sued on was a second renewal of a note of L. A. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal for a like amount of date 30th November 1881, which was made and discounted to raise funds to be employed in the general elections of 1881 then about to be held to choose members of the Provincial Parliament in which election L. A. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal was acting and deeply interested for the Government, and probably in regard to the sale of the North Shore Railway then being agitated. J. M. Dufresne says that at his solicitation, the St. Louis Brothers agreed to subscribe to the electoral fund, to the extent of $4,000, to be paid when they should receive their money from the Government and should be indemnified for their damages and losses; they said that is Emmanuel St Louis said at the time, that they could not make that subscription unless the Government adopted their account for damages and extras. L. A S\u00e9n\u00e9cal was at the time superintendent and controlled everything. These negotiations were with Emmanuel St. Louis.\nOther witnesses were examined to show that Emmanuel St. Louis acknowledged a liability and would have been willing to pay his half of the amount if his brother had been willing to contribute his half share.\nF. X. Archambault Q. C. for appellant.\nGeoffrion Q. C. and Ouimet Q. C. for respondent.\nSir W. J RITCHIE C. J. After reading the above statement of the facts of the case proceeded as follows :\nI think this appeal should be dismissed. The plaintiff has shown no legal claim against the defendants; the original transaction was in my opinion unquestionably void under 38 Vic. c. 7, sec. 266, now reproduced in article 425 R. S. Q. Province of Quebec, the note having been discounted for election purposes and the proceeds handed over to Dufresne for S\u00e9n\u00e9cal to be used as a portion of an election fund controlled by him.\nAs to the check the defendants got no consideration for it and the parties to it do not appear to have in any way authorised its being given by Emanuel St. Louis, or to have acknowledged any liability on it, and under any circumstances whether the note or check was given to Dufresne for S\u00e9n\u00e9cal to induce him as representing the Government to secure the settlement of their claim for damages against the Government or as a contribution to an election fund it was equally void in law.\nI think this appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J. It is clear upon the evidence that the original note, of which that of the 7th of March, 1882, which is the basis of the action was a second renewal was made and endorsed by L. A. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal and handed to the respondents in order that they might get it discounted and pay over the proceeds to S\u00e9n\u00e9cal That they did get the note discounted and did hand over the proceeds to Dufresne for the benefit of and as agent for S\u00e9n\u00e9cal for the purpose of being used for illegal purposes at a Provincial Election is also established. It also appears that if the respondents did make any promise to S\u00e9n\u00e9cal to indemnify him against the note it was so made by way of subscription to the election fund before mentioned and was therefore illegal and void. The respondents are therefore not liable on the note for the reason that they are not parties to it, and any promise of indemnity must fail by reason of its illegal tendency.\nThe question is wholly one of evidence and there is no ground whatever for in any way interfering with the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench. The appeal must he dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J. I am in favor of dismissing this appeal. It is a clear case. Two parties join together to raise money for an illegal purpose, and now one of them, the maker of the note tries to collect it from the endorser. There is an express provision of the law against such dealings.\nGWYNNE, J.-It is abundantly clear that the plaintiff utterly failed to prove the allegation in the declaration essentially necessary to be proved to entitle the plaintiff to recover ; that the note to recover the amount of which as having been a loan by the late Mr. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal to the defendants the action was brought, and which was made by Mr. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal payable to his own order or the original note, of which the one sued upon was a renewal and the proceeds of which original note were received by Mr. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal himself was made to raise money for the accommodation of the defendants and lent to them as alleged in the declaration. Having utterly failed to establish this material allegation in the declaration the plaintiff cannot recover.\nThe only connection of the defendants with the note in question appears to have been a promise made by the defendants to take up for Mr. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal the note sued upon, which promise was based upon a corrupt, illegal and fraudulent consideration promised by Mr. S\u00e9n\u00e9cal to be given to the defendants which, however, does not appear to have been in fact given by him. The particulars of this corrupt and illegal consideration are so well explained in the judgment of Mr. Justice Cross in the Court of Queen's Bench at Montreal in appeal that it is not necessary to repeat them. The appeal must, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J. was also of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant : F. X. Archambault.\nSolicitors for respondent : Ouimet, Cornellier & Eymard.\n[1] M.L.R. 5 Q.B. 332.\n"

The aforesaid party of the second part hereby agrees, and binds himself, that upon the certificates of his Engineer that the work contemplated to be done under this contract has been fully completed by the party of the first part, he will pay said party of the first part, for the performance of the same in full, for materials and workmanship. It is further agreed, by the party of the second part, that estimates shall be made during the progress of the work on or about the first of each month, and that payments shall be made by second party upon the estimate and certificate of his engineer, to the party of the first part, on or before the 20th day of each month for the amount and value of work done and materials furnished during the previous month, ten per cent. being deducted and retained by the party of the second part until the final completion of the work embraced in this contract, when all sums due the party of the first part shall be fully paid, and this contract considered cancelled.'' Upon completion of the contract the engineer made a final estimate fixing the value of the work done by the sub-contractor at $79,142.65, and after deducting the money paid to and received by the sub-contractor, and a clerical error appearing on the face of the certificate, a sum of $41187.32 remained due to the sub-contractor. Upon an action brought by the subcontractor to recover the sum of $36,312.12, the Superior Court, whose judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench, granted the plaintiff the amount of $4,187.32 with interest and costs.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the court below, that the estimate as given by the engineer was substantially such a certificate as the contract contemplated, but if not the plaintiff must fail as a final certificate of the engineer was a condition precedent to his right to recover.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (Appeal Side) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThis was an action brought by the appellant to recover the sum of $36,312.22. alleged to be due to him under a sub -contract entered into at Quebec and executed before Glackemeyer, notary public, on the 11th September, 1877, between the appellant and George Leprohon of the one part, and the respondent on the other for the construction of certain portions of the North Shore Railroad, the respondent having a contract with the Government of the Province of Quebec to build said road. The engineer valued the work done by the appellant at $79,142.55 and gave him a final estimate for that amount. The provisions of the contract and other facts material to the consideration of the case will be found in the headnote and judgments.\nThe Superior Court, holding that the said certificate bound the parties adopted the sum therein mentioned as being the only one due, and crediting the defendant with the $74500 paid by him condemned him to pay the balance $4642.65 with interest from the date of the summons and costs, and the parties proceeded to trial on these issues.\nThis judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench.\nCasgrain Q.C. for appellant, cited Redfield on Railways ([1]) and contended that the certificate relied on by the respondent was not the certificate required by the contract.\nPentland Q.

O.\nThis is either a final estimate or it is not.\nI think it is substantially such as the contract contemplates and therefore the appellant is bound by it, but if it is not then by the terms of the contract the appellant is only bound to pay upon the certificate of his Engineer that the work contemplated to be done under the contract has been fully completed and wanting this the plaintiff must fail as such certificate is a condition precedent to his right to recover.\nI therefore think the plaintiff must fail in this appeal.\nSTRONG J.-It would be impossible to give the appellant the relief be asks by this appeal without overruling many previous decisions of this court and disregarding innumerable other authorities. The respondent was a contractor for the construction of a part of the North Shore Railway and the appellant and one Leprohon entered into a sub-contract to perform a portion of the work included in the respondent's contract.\nThis sub-contract was in writing and it expressly provided that the respondent should upon the certificate of his Engineer \" that the work contemplated to be done under this contract has been fully completed by the party of the first part \"(the appellant and Leprohon) pay said party of the first part for the performance of the same in full at certain specified rates contained in a schedule immediately following.\nAnd it was further provided by the second clause of the contract that as regards extra work the Engineer should either before the work should be performed fix such prices as he should consider just and equitable and the parties should abide by such prices provided the party of the first part should enter upon and commence the work with a full knowledge of the prices so fixed by the Engineer, orif the extra work should be done before such prices should have been fixed for such work then the Engineer should estimate the same at such prices as he should deem just and reasonable and his decision should be final.\nThe work was completed and on the 30th April 1879, Mr. Odell, the contractor's engineer made his final estimate by which he found the price and value of the work done by the appellant and his partner Leprohon amounted to $79 142.65. Previously to this Leprohon who was associated with the respondent in the performance of the work as a partner and co-contractor had ceded and transferred all his interest in the contract and in the monies arising therefrom to the respondent. Of this amount fixed as the price of the work $74,500 had been paid to the appellant, which after allowing to the respondent a deduction of $455.53, the amount of a clerical error appearing on the face of the certificate, a sum of $4,187.32 remained due for which amount with interest the Court of Queen's Bench have given judgment.\nAccording to the terms of the contract both parties are bound by the engineer's certificate just as firmly as they would have been if they had entered into a formal and authentic deed fixing the amount due to the appellant for the work done at the amount ascertained by the final estimate. Then there being no dispute whatever between the parties as regards the payment and the error in the 'certificate it must follow that the judgment appealed against is unimpeachable.\nBoth this appeal and the cross-appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER GWYNNE and PATTERSON JJ. concurred that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : Casgrain, Angers & Lavery.\nSolicitors for respondent : caron, Pentland & Stuart.\n[1] P. 306.\n[2] 4 Can.

S. N. S. 4th ser. providing for the appointment of boards of health by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. Ritchie C.J. doubting the authority of the Lieutenant-Governor to appoint in incorporated counties.\nA board of health appointed by the executive council by resolution employed M., a physician, to attend upon small-pox patients in the district \"for the season\" at a fixed rate of remuneration per day. Complaint having been made of the manner in which M.'s duties were performed he was notified that another medical man had been employed as a consulting physician, but refusing to consult with the new appointee he was dismissed from his employment. He brought an action against the municipality setting forth in his statement of claim the facts of his engagement and dismissal and claiming payment for his services up to the date at which the last small-pox patient was cured and special damages for loss of reputation by the dismissal. The act (R.S.N.S. 4th ser. c. 29 s. 12, allows the board of health to incur reasonable expenses, which are defined (by 37 V. (N.S.). c. 6 s. 1) to be services performed and bestowed and medicine supplied by physicians, in carrying out its provisions, and makes such expenses a district, city or county rate to be assessed by the justices and levied as ordinary county rates.\nHeld, Per Fournier, Gwynne and Taschereau JJ. affirming the judgment of the court below, that the contract with M. was to pay him $6.50 per day so long as small-pox should prevail in the district during the season; that his dismissal was wrongful and the fulfilment of the contract could be enforced against the municipality by action.\nPer Ritchie C.J and Strong J. That there was sufficient ground for the dismissal of M. Assuming, however, his dismissal to have been unjustifiable, M's. only remedy would have been by mandamus to compel the municipality to make an assessment to cover the expense incurred. But the claim being really one for damages for wrongful dismissal it did not come within the \"reasonable expenses,\" which may incurred by a board of health and made a charge on the county, and the municipality was, therefore, not liable.\nPer Patterson J. That the proper remedy for the recovery of the expenses mentioned in said sec. 12 is by action and not by mandamus to compel an assessment, but a claim for damages for wrongful dismissal does not come within the section and is not made a county charge.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] affirming the judgment for the plaintiff at the trial.\nThe plaintiff in his statement of claim alleges that he is a duly qualified medical practitioner for Nova Scotia; that he was employed by the defendants through \"the board of health for District No. 4 North Sidney,\" to attend certain person there ill of the small-pox and who might thereafter during the \"then season\" become ill of that disease in District No. 4; that the board agreed to pay plaintiff for his services at the rate of $6.50 per day for said period; that the plaintiff relinquished his other practice in order to attend to his duties under this agreement with the board of health; that the board of health nevertheless discharged plaintiff and employed other practitioners; that the plaintiff has suffered special damage by reason of such a wrongful dismissal; that persons would not employ him for fear of contagion and by reason of his dismissal the public were led to believe he had neglected his duty. And plaintiff claimed damages to the amount of $700, viz. $350 for salary from 12 March to 8 May 1880, at $6 50 per diem, and $550 for special damages for wrongful dismissal.\nThe defence states: That defendants did not employ plaintiff'; that the board of health was not legally appointed; that the board of health did not employ plaintiff; that plaintiff did not give up his other practise; that defendants did not through board or otherwise agree to pay plaintiff for his services; that defendants never discharged plaintiff, or employed other practitioners; that provisions of chap. 29 of revised statutes were not complied with, and board had no authority to employ plaintiff; that board having appointed another physician to act with plaintiff as consulting physician and surgeon, plaintiff refused to act or consult with such physician and for that reason board dismissed him.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Macdonald without a jury, who found a verdict and entered judgment for the plaintiff for $300.\nFrom the evidence given on the trial of this case the following facts appeared: In the month of February, 1880, small pox broke out at North Sydney, Cape Breton. About the 9th or 10th of February meetings of the inhabitants were held to consider the best means to be used to prevent the spread of the disease, and a board of health was chosen, the persons comprising which were subsequently by a commission under the great seal of the province, bearing date the 16th February, 1880, duly constituted by the Lieutenant Governor a board of health, pursuant to the provisions of the Revised Statutes, N.S., 4th series, ch. 29, sec. 2, for the police district of North Sydney. At a meeting of this board, held on the 17th February, a resolution was passed \"that a doctor be secured and retained by the board to attend upon all the small pox patients who are and may, the present season be attacked with the disease of small pox in district No. 4, under board's jurisdiction at the rate of $6.50 per day.\" At a subsequent meeting of the board held on the same day, there is a minute as follows: \"Dr. McKay being present agreed to take charge of the small pox patients at the rate of $6.50 per day under the conditions of the resolution passed by the board this morning; all medicines and drugs to be provided by the board, and his services to the board thereunder to commence from the 18th February instant; thereupon a resolution was passed that Dr. McKay be engaged for such purposes and under such conditions.\" The plaintiff in his disposition says: \"The matter was discussed and the board decided they would not retain us by the month, as they did not know how long the disease would last, and that they thought they should pay us so much a day, viz., $6.50, with the understanding that whichever doctor was engaged his services were to be retained as long as there should be a small pox patient under the jurisdiction of the board that season.\" Subsequently he says: \"I was present at the afternoon meeting. They asked me if I would attend the smallpox patients on the terms stated in the resolution passed at the morning meeting. I said I would. Then a resolution was passed that I should be engaged and services accepted under those considerations.\"\nPlaintiff entered upon his duties immediately after the passing of the resolution of 17th February and continued his services up to the 12th of March. On the last mentioned day the plaintiff received a communication from the secretary of the board informing him that the board had passed the following resolution, viz.: \"Resolved that the board courteously dispense with the services of Dr. E. N. McKay from this date, as they consider the service of two doctors unnecessary for the present, and that the services of Dr. McPherson be retained until further notified and the secretary's letter concludes as follows: \"You will therefore consider yourself relieved from further attendance on behalf of this board and upon such patients from this date.\" The circumstances which led to this dismissal appear to have been the following: Sometime before the 5th of March the board passed the following resolution: \"Resolved that a doctor be engaged by this board to visit the hospital daily as a consulting physician and to report his opinions of the treatment and condition of the patients therein to this board daily.\" And in the letter of the secretary of the 5th of March communicating this resolution to the plaintiff, the secretary added, \"I am instructed by the board to request that you consult with Dr. McPherson and then inform the board through the secretary by 10.30 o'clock, a.m. to-morrow whether you will consent to act together in pursuance with such resolution. Please reply punctually.\"\nThe plaintiff did not answer this letter until the 8th of March, when he wrote to the secretary as follows: \"I will not act in pursuance with the inclosed resolution, but I will continue my services to the board as I have heretofore done and consult Dr. McPherson upon such occasion as I would like to ascertain his opinion respecting the condition and treatment of such patient or patients as may happen to come under my care from time to time. I mean ascertaining his opinion in serious cases only. If the board send Dr. McPherson to the hospital daily to report my treatment and condition of patients I will throw no obstacle in the way, but I will consult him only in cases of emergency. You know, Mr. Hearn, that I consented only to one clause embodied in that resolution, neither will I. Bear in mind that while I do not throw any obstacle in the way of the board with regard to sending Dr. McPherson to the hospital daily to make a report he does not prescribe to any patient under my treatment without my consent.\" Upon this resolution of dismissal was passed and the plaintiff discontinued his services from the 12th of March up to which date he was paid for his services from the 18th of February at the rate of $6.50 per diem. The plaintiff having brought an action against individual members of the board in which he failed (1) instituted this action action against the company in 1886.\nThe learned judge who tried the cause having given judgment for the plaintiff as before mentioned the defendants appealed to the Supreme Court in Banc by which court the appeal was, after argument, dismissed. The judgment of the court was delivered by Mr. Justice Townshend who held that under sec. 12 of ch. 29 R. S. N. S. (4th series) the municipality was rendered liable to the plaintiff on the contract entered into by the board of health. Mr. Justice Ritchie also delivered a short judgment holding that on the authority of McKay v. Moore[2] the statutory provision already mentioned was to be held as imposing liability on the defendants, but also stated his opinion to be that in \"most cases\" the proper remedy to enforce the obligation imposed on the municipality by sec. 12 of ch. 29 (4th series), will be found to be a writ of mandamus to compel an assessment.\nThe Municipality appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nW. B. Ritchie for the respondent. The executive council could not appoint this board. The act of 1879 vested the power of appointment in the municipality and that repeals the former act so far as the two are repugnant. Maxwell on Statutes[3]; New London Railroad Company v. Boston and Albany Railroad Company[4].\nThe board could not bind the municipality by such an agreement as this. See Smith v. Corporation of Collingwood[5]; Re Derby and Local Board of Health[6].\nIn any event the municipality is only liable, under the statutes, for services actually performed.\nThe evidence shows justification for the dismissal.\nHenry Q. C. for the respondent. The action is on a contract for services covered by the statutes and not an action for a tort.\nThe statutes make the municipality liable for expense incurred by the board of health which is explained to mean services such as those in this case.\nSir W. J. RITCHIE C. J.\u2014It is very clear from the evidence that there was no contract whatever between the municipalities of the county of Cape Breton and the plaintiff, and that the defendants never directly nor through the board of health for district No. 4 North Sydney actually employed the plaintiff as alleged in paragraph 2 of the claim, and never directly nor through said board agreed to pay plaintiff for his services as alleged in paragraph 3; nor does it appear that the defendants ignored such an agreement as there referred to, or ever discharged the plaintiff from the performance of that or any agreement or employed other medical practitioners as alleged in paragraph 4. Issues on all these most material allegations were raised by the defendants' defence paragraphs 2, 5 and 7, and being unsustained by any evidence should have been found for the defendants. The plaintiff, the evidence shows, was employed by a board of health constituted by a commission issued by the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia on the 16th February, 1880. But it does not appear from the evidence that any sanatory orders were ever made or orders given prescribing the duties of such boards as required by the act R.S.N.S., 4th ser. ch. 29, and an issue has been raised as to the due constitution and appointment of this board in that no such sanatory orders have been made nor the duties of said board prescribed, and paragraph 9 of the defence also alleges that persons acting or purporting to act as the board of health for the district of North Sydney appointed the plaintiff as physician and surgeon to have the care and attention of small-pox patients, and that complaints having been made of want of skill and attention the board appointed another physician with whom the plaintiff refused to act and consult, and he ceased to attend persons ill and afflicted with smallpox, and the said board was compelled to employ other physicians and they discharged the plaintiff from the position aforesaid.\nIn the same volume of the revised statutes p. 288 title 13 is ch. 57 \"of municipalities in incorporated counties,\" which the County of Cape Breton appears to have been. By section 56 municipal corporations shall have the appointment of health officers, health wardens and health inspectors, and a board of health with the authority and powers given to justices in general or special sessions by the 29th and 30th chapters. These statutes do not give the sessions any power to appoint a board of health, but to appoint health officers with power to enter houses, etc., and report their condition to the board of health, and if the sessions do not appoint such health wardens the board of health shall appoint them. Sessions of not less than seven justices on requisition from the board of health may order a general vaccination, and it is also enacted, page 805 of the Revised Statutes that \"nothing in this chapter contained shall be construed to repeal or affect the provisions of any law or enactment now in force except so far only as such law or enactment shall be inconsistent with or repugnant to the provisions of this chapter or the attainment of the objects and purposes thereof.\"\nWithout expressing any positive opinion I incline to think that this enactment authorising municipal corporations to appoint boards of health is inconsistent with the authority of the Governor to appoint a board of health in an incorporated county. The conflict of jurisdiction of two boards of health in the same county, one appointed by the Governor and the other by the municipal council, so likely to arise and productive of so great inconvenience, is such that I scarcely think that the legislature could have contemplated the existence of two such bodies in the same county but that in unincorporated counties, if any, the power continued in the governor in which case the reasonable expenses would be assessed by the justices in session and levied and collected as provided by the 12th section of chapter 29, while in incorporated counties the appointment would be confined to the municipal councils. But be this as it may, in the view I take of this case it is unnecessary to decide this or the other questions I have referred to, because I think this action cannot be maintained against the municipality under any circumstances, though I may say if the only question in the case was the dismissal of the plaintiff as at present advised I should say there was ample ground for it. All that is made a charge on the county by ch. 29 are the reasonable expenses already incurred or hereafter to be incurred by any board of health, and the act of 1874, cap. 6, expressly declares that the words reasonable expenses in the said 12th section shall be construed to include all medical attendance and services bestowed and performed and medicine supplied by physicians when required to be bestowed, performed and supplied under the provisions of such chapter. How can it be said that this claim for a wrongful discharge by the board of health, whereby as he alleges the defendants (though in point of fact they had nothing to do with the matter) discharged plaintiff and employed other medical practioners, are services bestowed and performed and medicine supplied when required to be bestowed or performed, when his complaint is that he never bestowed or performed any services or supplied medicines because he was discharged from doing so? How can he possibly bring the special damage he alleges he suffered by reason of his patients not employing him from dread of infection and contagion, or that by such discharge and employment of other medical practitioners it was indicated and so believed and understood by many persons who would likely employ him that he improperly cared for and attended such patients and was not a competent medical practitioner, within the terms of the statute as services bestowed and performed and medicine supplied? If they do not come within the definition of the statute of reasonable expenses they are not a charge on the county. If the plaintiff has a legal claim which has become a county or district charge in my opinion his remedy for its recovery is not by action against the municipality. The law fixing the charge has given the remedy which is clearly not by action. I think it is clearly established that where a pecuniary obligation is created by statute, and a remedy is expressly given for enforcing it, that remedy must be adopted. The case of the Vestry of St. Paneras v. Battersby[7], clearly established this. In the present case the language is:\u2014\nThe reasonable expenses incurred, &c., by any board of health shall be a county or district or city charge and shall be assessed by the justices in session (now by the municipal council) in incorporated counties and levied and collected in the same manner and at the same time as the ordinary county rates.\nCress well J. in the case cited states the principle, which is entirely applicable to this case, very tersely when he says:\u2014\nI also am of opinion that a pecuniary obligation and the mode of enforcing it are indissolubly united by the statute and cannot be severed.\nIt would be a very strange thing if the municipalities could be sued the moment the expense was incurred by all or any of the parties who may have given medical attendance or bestowed and performed services or supplied medicine and other necessaries for combating the disease or in carrying out the powers of the act and the municipality be thus harrassed by actions and put to great cost when they have no funds to meet these expenses, and possibly before the time has arrived when the amount could be assessed, levied and collected. It would be most unreasonable that these parties should be allowed to obtain judgments and be in a position to sell the municipal property for their satisfaction to the possibly great inconvenience and loss of the municipality. I think this cannot be so. The only fund those who supply medical attendance or other services or materials and necessaries can look to is that provided by the statute, namely, the county charge to be assessed as provided. The legislature having provided municipalities with no other funds to meet these expenses if parties are not satisfied to rely on this they should not render the services or supply the necessaries, and if inconvenience should arise from any such cause the legislature must interfere and provide other means for their payment, and in the event of the municipality failing to assess in a proper case the only means of compelling it is to do so, so far as I am aware, is by the prerogative writ of mandamus. Should an application be made for a mandamus in this case it would be open to the municipality to raise all or any of the questions discussed before us or to which I have referred or any other they may be advised would afford an answer to such an application. In the meantime this appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed with costs in all the courts.\nSTRONG J.\u2014In my opinion this appeal must succeed. As regards the objection that the power of the Lieutenant Governor to appoint boards of health conferred by sec. 2 of cap. 29 (R.S.N.S. 4 series) is superseded, and that section repealed by implication, by sec. 56 of ch. 57 (R. S. 4 series), it appears to me that there is no foundation for such a contention. The board of health contemplated by sec. 56 of cap. 57 seems to have been a general board for the whole municipality, the words of the statute being \"a board of health.\" The board provided for by sec. 2 of cap. 29 is on the other hand a local board restricted to such place or district as the Lieutenant Governor may prescribe. It is therefore impossible to say that these two provisions are so inconsistent that they cannot stand together but must be regarded as repugnant to each other to such an extent that the prior enactment is to be taken to be by implication repealed by the latter.\nI do not think the appointment was void because the Lieutenant Governor did not make sanatory regulations under sec. 1 of ch. 29. The board enforcing such sanatory regulations as the Lieutenant Governor might prescribe was no doubt to perform certain duties to which the making of sanatory regulations was an indispensable preliminary, but there were other duties incidental to such a body which were incumbent upon the board irrespective of any regulations by the Lieutenant Governor defining the nature of these latter duties, these being such as usually and without any specific provisions by the executive power are well understood as appertaining to such bodies as local boards of health. In the execution of these latter functions I have no doubt that it was within the power of the board to employ a medical man to take charge of a hospital for smallpox patients and to attend to such patients generally, and that his remuneration would be a \"reasonable expense\" under sec. 12. I am, however, of opinion that sec. 12 would not authorize such an action as the present against the municipality. The county are in no way a party to the contract between the respondent and the board of health. The latter body are not appointed by the county, and are not in any sense its officers or agents. Any liability of the county for the contracts of the board must rest entirely upon the statute and be limited by its terms. The present action is substantially one for a wrongful dismissal by the board in breach of the contract with the respondent, the respondent having been paid the full compensation for his actual services up to the date of the dismissal. Then, what is there in the statute to warrant such an action in respect of the conduct of the board against the municipality? The words of sec. 12 (in which clause of the statute, if anywhere, we must find the liability sought to be enforced), are not that the county shall be bound by the contracts of the board but merely that the \"reasonable expenses\" of the board shall be a \"county, district or city charge\" to be assessed, levied and collected in the same way as ordinary rates. Then what is the proper construction of these words? Can they be so interpreted as to include a liability such as the respondent insists upon in this action? I may here turn aside for a moment to notice a point which was raised in the court below founded upon the word \"district.\" I have no hesitation in adopting in its entirety the construction of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia attributing to this word the meaning of a municipal district, such as those which in some cases in Nova Scotia have been formed out of part of a county. The whole context and the preceding and following words \"county\" and \"city\" indicate this to be the true meaning.\nBut, to return to the question of municipal liability, how can it be said that imposing a duty upon the county to raise by the imposition of a rate the amount required to defray the expenses of a board of health creates any privity of contract between the creditors of the board and the company? I can see nothing to justify such an extension of the language actually used which would be requisite in order to give such an operation to the statute. No doubt there is a duty resting on the company to raise the amount of the expenses, but the existence of that duty is not sufficient to support such an action as the present for a breach of contract by the board. The appropriate remedy for the enforcement of that duty is the writ of mandamus. Therefore, it appears to me that no action is maintainable against the county for any breach of contract by the board.\nFurther, I doubt if there was anything more than a contract for services from day to day. The word \"season\" in the connection in which it is used in the resolution is too indefinite to have any precise signification. The respondent himself in his deposition says he accepted the employment on the terms embodied in the resolution, and by these terms he must therefore abide, and he cannot go outside of them and annex an additional term which he says vaguely was spoken of, viz., that the employment was to last as long as there remained any small-pox patients which would have continued it to the 5th of May. I do not, however, rest my judgment on this point.\nNext, assuming the action to be maintainable, was there not good ground for dismissal? Surely there was nothing unreasonable in the proposition of the board that Dr. McPherson should act in conjunction with the respondent as a consulting physician. In his letter of the 8th of March, addressed to the secretary of the board, the respondent positively refused to comply with the ordinances of the board in this respect. Having taken this course of refusing to obey the reasonable and lawful directions of his employers he must, it seems to me, abide by the consequences and submit to the resolution discharging him from employment, which the board having clearly the right so to do saw fit to pass.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs.\nFOURNIER J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I also agree with my brother Gwynne that this appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This case turns, in my opinion, upon the construction to be put upon section 12 of ch. 29 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 4th series, as that section is amended by ch. 6 of the acts of 1874. I entertain, no doubt, that the board of health for polling district No. 4, in the county of Cape Breton, was well constituted by the commission issued by the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia bearing date the 16th of February, 1880. The contention of the learned counsel of the appellants, that chapter 29 of the 4th series of the Revised Statutes which gives power to the Lieutenant Governor to appoint boards of health was repealed by implication by sec. 67 of ch. 1 of the acts of 1879, cannot be entertained.\nThe 4th series of the Revised Statutes constituted an act consisting of several chapters all equally in force. By chapter 29 of that act the Lieutenant Governor was authorized to constitute boards of health, and to appoint the members thereof. By chapter 57 of the same act, sec. 56, it was enacted that the county municipal corporations constituted under the act\nshall have the appointment of health officers, health wardens, and health inspectors, and a board of health with the authority and powers given to justices in general or special sessions by chapters 29 and 30.\nIt is obvious that the powers thus conferred upon county municipal corporations did not repeal the powers given to the Lieutenant Governor to constitute boards of health by chapter 29 of the same act. It may be that the legislature thought it prudent thus to provide against the injurious consequences which might result in the case of neglect or delay upon the part of the municipal authorities, but whatever may have been the motive for retaining both provisions it is clear that sec. 56 of ch. 57 of the 4th series did not repeal sec. 1 of ch. 29 of the same series.\nHere ch. 1 of the acts of 1879 is but a reconsolidation into one act of the laws relating to county municipal corporations, and while by its 88th section it repealed ch. 57 of the 4th series it re-enacted in its 67th section in identical terms the provisions contained in the 56th sec. of ch. 57 of the 4th series and thus expressly referred to chs. 29 and 30 of the 4th series as still in full force and effect. It is clear, therefore, that ch. 1 of the acts of 1879 did not repeal the 1st sec. of ch. 29 of the 4th series any more than did sec. 56 of the above chapter 57. That this is so is further apparent by reference to the act which constitutes the 5th series of the Revised Statutes, for there in chapter 26 the 1st section of ch. 29 of the 4th series, which is the section which authorizes the Lieutenant Governor to appoint boards of health, is re-enacted verbatim, and in sec. 80 of ch. 56 of the same act is re-enacted the power vested in the municipal councils of county corporations to appoint boards of health as follows:\u2014\nThe municipal council shall have the appointment of health officers, health wardens and health inspectors and a board of health who shall have the powers conferred by chapters 26 and 27 of the Revised Statutes.\nThese statutes, 26 and 27 of the 5th series, being identical with chs. 29 and 30 of the 4th series, save only that the words \"municipal councils\" &c., are substituted for the words \"courts of general or special sessions,\" it is not disputed that upon the 19th February, 1880, the board of health which was appointed by the Lieutenant Governor by the commission bearing date the 16th of said month of February did in point of fact pass a resolution for engaging the services of a medical man to attend to small pox patients, which resolution was in the following terms:\u2014\nThat, a doctor be secured and retained by the board to attend upon all the small pox patients who are, and may the present season, be attacked with the disease of small pox in District No. 4 under the board's jurisdiction at the rate of $6.50 a day.\nIt is admitted also that at a meeting of the board the plaintiff,\nDr. McKay, being present agreed to take charge of the small pox patients at the rate of $6.50 under the resolution passed by the board this morning, all medicines and drugs to be provided by the board, and his services to the board thereunder to commence from the 18th February instant,\nand that thereupon a resolution was passed by the board\nthat Dr. McKay be engaged for such purpose and under such conditions.\nThe plaintiff, in his statement of claim, states that he was a duly qualified medical practitioner within the Province of Nova Scotia, and that as such he was employed by the defendants, through the board of health for district number four North Sydney, in the County of Cape Breton, to attend certain persons then ill of smallpox, and who might thereafter, during the then season, become ill of that disease in the said district No. 4, and that the defendants, through the said board, agreed to pay plaintiff for his services $6.50 per day for the period, and that plaintiff gave up his other practice as a medical practitioner, and endeavored to heal and cure such sick persons, and gave them his care and attention, and was willing to continue his services, yet defendants ignored said agreement, and whilst persons were sick of the said disease during the said season in said district the defendants discharged the plaintiff and employed other medical practitioners\u2014whereby plaintiff suffered damage, &c.\nThe defendants, in their statement of defence, admit that plaintiff is a duly qualified medical practitioner as alleged, but deny that they employed the plaintiff through the alleged board of health or otherwise. They then deny that the board of health was duly constituted. They deny that the plaintiff was at all employed by the said alleged board of health\u2014and they deny that the defendants, through the said board of health or otherwise, agreed to pay the plaintiff for his services, and they say that they never discharged the plaintiff, nor did they employ other medical practitioners, and finally they pleaded certain allegations by way of justification of the dismissal and discharge of the plaintiff by the board of health that employed him.\nThe learned judge who tried the case, in his judgment, declared that no evidence was produced at the trial of any justification for dismissal of the plaintiff, and he found all the issues in favor of the plaintiff and rendered a judgment in his favor for $350.00 and costs.\nThis judgment, upon appeal, was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, from the judgment of which court in affirmance of the judgment of the trial judge this appeal is taken.\nThe argument before us consisted for the most part of merely technical objections.\n1. That the board of health that employed the plaintiff was not legally constituted.\n2. Assuming it to have been that the contract made with the plaintiff by the board was the contract of the defendants;\n3. That the action was substantially for a wrongful dismissal and that for such wrong the defendants were not liable, their liability being limited to what is prescribed by sec. 12 of c. 29 of the revised statutes of Nova Scotia 4th series as amended by c. 6 of the acts of 1874.\nAs to the first of these objections I have already expressed my opinion to be that the board of health that employed the plaintiff was duly constituted.\nAs to the 2nd and 3rd of the objections as above stated they are purely of a technical character for, under the statutory provisions as to amendments required to be made as well by the court below as by this court, in order that the true question in issue between the parties shall be determined, the pleadings can, and should even now, be amended if necessary so as to raise such true questions, but they do, I think, sufficiently raise such questions, which are not whether the contract entered into by the board of health with the plaintiff is strictly speaking the contract of the defendants, or the dismissal of the plaintiff by the board if wrongful, the wrongful act of the defendants but\n1. Whether the plaintiff fulfilled the contract upon his part in all things which according to a reasonable construction of the contract were to be fulfilled by him.\n2. Whether the board of health fulfilled the contract in all things, which according to a reasonable construction of it were to be performed by them.\n3. Whether, assuming the first question to be answered in the affirmative and the second in the nagative, the defendants are by sec. 12 of c. 29, 4th series, as amended by c. 6 of the acts of 1874, liable to the plaintiff to pay him the amount agreed by the board to be paid to him for his services, namely, $6.50 per day, as long as the small pox should prevail in that season, which it is not disputed was until the 5th of May, 1880. These are the real points in issue between the parties which they went down to try, and which in point of fact were tried, and which are now before us for our decision.\nNow, the first point to be determined is: What is the true construction of the contract?\nThe resolution of the board under which the plaintiff agreed to render his services at $6.50 per day was that\na doctor be secured and retained to attend upon all small pox patients which were then and during that season might be attacked with small pox in the District No. 4 under the jurisdiction of the board.\nIt was in accordance with this resolution and for the purposes thereof that the plaintiff was engaged, secured and retained, and, for the remuneration of $6.50 per day during such time in the then season that there should be small pox patients in the district under the jurisdiction of the board, he agreed to render his professional services. To fulfil this contract upon his part it was natural that he should have given up, and he says that he did give up, his general practice in order to keep himself always in readiness to attend to small pox patents and to fulfil his contract. The reasonable construction then of this contract appears to me to be that thereby the plaintiff was secured, retained and engaged to attend to all small pox patients there should be during the season in the District No. 4 under the jurisdiction of the board. And if he kept himself in readiness to attend to all such small pox patients so long as there should be any requiring medical attendance, and did attend to all such as he was permitted by the board to attend, he must, I think, be held to have fulfilled his contract according to its reasonable construction in all things upon his part to be performed. That he did so fulfil his contract the learned judge who tried the case has found as matter of fact, and that point must be held to be determined in the plaintiff's favor.\nThen as to the board of health the true construction of their contract is, I think, that they engaged and retained the plaintiff to attend to all small pox patients within the jurisdiction of the board who during the season should require medical attendance, and that he should be paid $6.50 a day during such period or so long as the plaintiff should fulfil his part of the contract. If, therefore, they prevented him attending to small pox patients within the district under the jurisdiction of the board who during the season required medical attendance they committed a breach of their contract which can only be justified and excused by there being pleaded and proved sufficient cause in excuse of such breach; and it appears that in point of fact although the board permitted the plaintiff to attend small pox patients from the 18th February to the 12th of March, 1880, they did, from thence until the 5th May, when there ceased to be any small pox patients requiring attendance in the district under the jurisdiction of the board, prevent the plaintiff from attending any such patients although he was ready and willing to attend them, and the board procured the attendance of another medical man without any justification of such their breach of their contract with the plaintiff, as the learned judge who tried the case has found. Under these circumstances the plaintiff's contract entitled him to be paid the $6.50 per day until the said 5th of May, and the only remaining question is whether the sections of the statutes referred to impose upon the defendants a liability to pay the plaintiff what must be admitted to be due to him under the terms and conditions of his contract.\nThe 12th sec. of c. 29 of the 4th series as amended by sec. 1st of c. 6 of the acts of 1874 reads as follows:\u2014\nThe reasonable expenses already incurred or hereafter to be incurred by any board of health in carrying out the provisions of this chapter, including all medical attendances and services bestowed and the medicines supplied by physicians when required by any board of health to be bestowed, performed and supplied under the provisions of this charter, shall be a county district or city charge and shall be assessed and levied and collected in the same manner and at the same time as the ordinary county rates.\nUpon the true construction of this clause there can, I think, be no doubt that it was competent for the board of health of the district No. 4, in the county of Cape Breton, to engage and retain the services of a medical man to be always in readiness to attend all small pox patients within the district under the jurisdiction of the board of health for as long as the disease should prevail in the district.\nHaving regard to the infectious nature of the disease and to the interference which constant attendance upon patients suffering from it would necessarily have with the medical man's general practice, it was legally reasonable, and indeed perhaps absolutely necessary, that the contract with the medical man engaged and retained should be for the whole period that the disease should prevail in the district as was done by the contract between the board of health and the plaintiff; and as the plaintiff has fulfilled that contract in all things to be performed upon his part the amount for which he contracted to render his professional services and which the board of health agreed should be paid to him at $6.50 a day so long as there should be small pox patients in the district is by the statute made a charge and liability upon the county corporation which they are bound to pay.\nIt has been suggested here, though not apparently in the court below, and no such defence is put upon the record, that the plaintiff's remedy is not by action but by mandamus. Apart from the point that no such defence has been raised upon the record I am of opinion that there is no weight in the objection now suggested for two reasons.\n1st. Because I think that the true construction of the statute is to make the amount as agreed upon between the board of health and the medical man whose services have been engaged and retained by them to be a charge upon the county corporation and a liability or debt due by them to the medical man, and in such a case the medical man so engaged and retained is vested with his common law right to enforce by action the liability and charge which is imposed upon the corporation by the statute. The statute in express terms imposes the amount which the plaintiff is entitled by his contract to demand and receive a charge and liability upon the corporation and it enables the corporation to reimburse themselves by levying an assessment in the same manner and at the same time as the \"ordinary county rates,\" levied to pay all other liabilities of the corporation.\nSecondly, because the power of making, even at this stage of the cause, all necessary amendments to prevent the miscarriage of justice is so extensive that the court can if necessary direct a prayer for a mandamus to be added to the statement of claim, and the judgment of the court under order 53 of ch. 104 of the Revised Statutes 5th series may order a mandamus to issue to compel the defendants to levy a rate, but, as I have already said, the statute under the circumstances appearing in the case imposes the amount which is due to the plaintiff as a charge and liability upon the corporation which can be enforced by action against the corporation and they can reimburse themselves. The appeal therefore, in my opinion, should be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014There is only one point in this case on which I entertain any serious doubt.\nI have no doubt that the law contained in chapter 29 of the 4th series Revised Statutes, was in force in 1880, when the transactions in question took place, and is, in fact, still in force. My brother Gwynne has dealt fully with that subject, and I have nothing to add to what he has said. I am also of opinion that the proper remedy for the recovery of the expenses mentioned in the 12th section of the act, whether those expenses have been paid by members of the board out of their own pockets, or are due to persons who have rendered services or furnished supplies under the orders of the board, is by an action like the present one, and not by mandamus to compel the making of an assessment. The latter proceeding would be very inconvenient, if not impracticable. It cannot have been the intention of the legislature that boards of health should incur a debt, payable only by means of an assessment made for the purpose, for every service rendered. If such were the idea it would of course apply to all services important or trifling, to the wages of a charwoman as well as to the fees of a physician. The statute, it is true, gives no direction for providing funds by the county in advance of the assessment which can only be collected once a year. The enactment of section 12 is, that the reasonable expenses incurred by the board shall be a county or district charge, and shall be assessed by the justices in session and levied and collected in the same manner and at the same time as the ordinary county rates. This might perhaps have been more happily expressed, but it means, as I think is sufficiently plain, that the operations of the board of health are to be conducted at the expense of the county or district\u2014\"district\" evidently denoting a district with a municipal organization, such as those mentioned in chapter 57 of the Revised Statutes 4th series\u2014and the provision referring to the assessment, which may have been inserted ex majore cautela, and may not have been strictly necessary, does not demand any other construction than that the expenses which the county is made liable for may be included in the ordinary estimates of money required for public purposes.\nThe making of these estimates was a duty of the grand jury of the county, and the assessments were made under orders of the sessions by the 21 ch. of the Revised Statutes 4th series, until those functions were transferred, 42 V. c. 1, s. 49, to the municipalities in 1879.\nThis understanding of the effect of sec. 12 is borne out by reference to cognate provisions of provincial acts, as well as to the other sections of chapter 29. Thus we have in section 11 an allusion to direct payments by the board of health. The section requires that a yellow flag shall be displayed on houses where there is small pox, and enacts that the expense shall be borne by the board; and section 9 which is strictly in pari materia with section 12, enacts that amounts for vaccinating poor people,\nwhen examined and allowed shall be assessed for and paid as other county and city charges.\nSometimes express provision has been made for procuring, in advance of the collection of the rate, the funds necessary to pay debts which are made a county charge. Thus, sec. 5 of ch 21 (4th series), authorized the grand jury to present sums required for certain local purposes, and empowered the sessions, who were to assess the localities for the amounts, to appoint commissioners to expend the money and to authorise the commissioners to borrow the amount, adding these words:\nAnd any money borrowed under this chapter shall be a county or district charge and bear interest till paid.\nThis money was evidently to be borrowed on the credit of the county or district, and not of the special local assessment.\nThere is part of an act printed in appendix A to the Revised Statutes, 4th series, which authorized the Provincial Government to advance money to pay compensation for buildings removed or destroyed for railway purposes, which money was to remain a county charge, to be raised by assessment and returned to the provincial treasury. In the present instance members of the board raised money by giving their own notes, as we are told by one of them. I see no reason why they should not have been supplied by the county with money to pay their way. Even a temporary loan effected by the council, such as under one of the statutes commissioners were authorized to procure, and under another might be made by the government, must be a matter of frequent occurrence when there are not funds on hand. No difficulty of the kind involved in the point in discussion was made with regard to the money paid to the plaintiff for his services up to the date of his dismissal, and the objection is not put upon the record. I infer from these circumstances that the construction I apply to the statute has been already recognized as the appropriate and practical one.\nThe doubt I have is whether the plaintiff's claim is one of the \"reasonable expenses\" incurred by the board of health which are, by section 12, made a county charge. The term \"reasonable expenses\" is a very comprehensive one, but its elasticity is limited by the effect of the act of 1874, chap. 6, which declares that it \"shall be construed to include all medical attendance and services bestowed and performed, and medicines supplied by physicians when required by any board of health to be bestowed, performed and supplied under the provisions of chapter 29.\"\nI do not see my way to give to the term \"reasonable expenses\" in section 12 a more extensive signification, as applied to professional claims of a physician, than that which this explanatory statute gives to it. The question, therefore, is whether the present claim can properly be treated as being for \"medical attendance and services bestowed and performed.\"\nNow, if the claim is regarded as one for wrongful dismissal I must answer the question in the negative. The board of health had no power to bind the county by an executory contract, or to make the county liable for a breach by the board of its own contract. Services refused and forbidden, and therefore left unperformed, cannot properly be called services bestowed and performed. I, for some time, was inclined to think that, the agreement being to pay the plaintiff $6.50 a day for his attendance on smallpox patients during the season, that scale of remuneration having been adopted in preference to $200 a month which had been proposed, the gross amount of $6.50 multiplied by the number of days during which there were any smallpox patients that season might be treated as the sum agreed to be paid for whatever services the plaintiff performed during the season he, of course, performing, as has been found in his favor, all that the board required of him.\nThe judgment practically proceeds upon that computation.\nOn reflection, however, I am satisfied that that mode of bringing the plaintiff's claim within the letter of section 12, as explained by the act of 1874, puts too great a strain upon the terms of the contract, under which the plaintiff would clearly be paid in full if paid $6.50 at the close of each day while he was bestowing attendance or performing services. It would, besides, by doubling the rate at which the professional services were valued, make the remuneration unreasonable, while the charge on the county is for reasonable expenses only.\nWe thus come back to the form in which the plaintiff has presented his claim, viz.: for damages for wrongful dismissal, and in that shape it is not, in my opinion, made a county charge.\nOn this ground I think the appeal should be allowed with costs and the action dismissed with costs.\nThe court being equally divided the appeal was dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Borden, Ritchie.

Merchants Bank if Halifax v. Gillespie, (10 Can. S. C R. 312.) distinguished.\nAppeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]), affirming a judgment of the Superior Court, by which the respondents were appointed liquidators of the Scottish Canadian Asbestos Company (limited) under the provisions of the Dominion Winding-up Act, ch. 129 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, and the appellant's motion to have the order set aside and to dissolve a meeting of creditors called under the statute, was rejected.\nThe Scottish Canadian Asbestos Company (limited), a Joint Stock Company, incorporated under the acts of Imperial Parliament of 1862 and 1886, having its head office in the City of Glasgow, Scotland, its principal business having been carried on at Arthabaska, in Canada, where its chief property and interests are situated, became insolvent, and proceedings were taken in Scotland for the winding-up of its affairs, and a liquidator was appointed.\nUpon a petition made by the firm of Lucke & Mitchell, creditors of the company, in which the Scottish liquidator joined, the Superior Court in and for the district of Arthabaska, Mr. Justice Billy presiding, made a winding-up order under the Canadian Statute, R.S.C. ch. 129, and the respondents were appointed liquidators. A motion was then made by the present appellant, a large shareholder, to set aside the said Winding-up order and also to dissolve a meeting of creditors called under the statute. The motion was in the following terms, viz. :\u2014\n\" That inasmuch as the said company was incorporated under the provisions of the Joint Stock Companies' Act of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and is subject to the provisions of the said Imperial Act as regards its status, powers, and franchises, and the rights and obligations of shareholders and contributories, and as regards all matters respecting its corporate capacity; and inasmuch as the said company is subject to the laws of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, as regards its liquidation; and inasmuch as the Winding-up Act of the Dominion of Canada does not apply to the said company; and inasmuch as the said Winding-up Act and all legislation of the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada, in so far as it relates or applies to the liquidation of the said company, is ultra vires of the said Parliament of the Dominion of Canada; that the present meeting of creditors be dissolved, and that the winding-up order and all proceedings had herein be set aside and declared irregular and of no effect, saving to the said company and its shareholders and creditors all rights to which they may be by law entitled.\"\nThis motion was rejected. The appellant thereupon applied for and obtained leave to appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, and that court by a majority affirmed the judgments appealed from. Thereupon the appellant obtained from the Registrar of the Supreme Court sitting as judge in chambers leave to appeal as required by sec. 76 of the Winding-up Act, and also the necessary order approving the security for costs under sec. 46 of the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act.\nThe question raised on this appeal is : Whether a winding-up order under the Canadian Act can be made against a company incorporated under the Imperial acts having assets in Canada, and whether the legislation of the Canadian Parliament providing therefor is within the powers of the said Parliament?\nMR. SMITH for appellant.\nTRENHOLME Q.C. for respondents.\nThe cases cited by counsel are reviewed in the judgments hereinafter given and in the report of the case in the court below ([2]).\nSIR W. J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014[After stating the facts of the case his Lordship proceeded as follows :\u2014]\nThe following cases bear on the question raised in this case : In re Matheson Brothers, limited ([3]) The head note is :\nThe court has jurisdiction under section 199 of the Companies Act, 1862, to wind up an unregistered joint stock company, formed and having its principal place of business in New Zealand, but having a branch office, agents, assets and liabilities in England.\nThe pendency of a foreign liquidation does not affect the julisdiction of the court to make a winding-up order in respect of the company under such liquidation although the court will, as a matter of international comity, have regard to the order of the foreign court.\nIt being alleged that proceedings to wind up the company were pending in New Zealand the- court in order to secure the English assets until proceedings should be taken by the New Zealand liquidators to make them available for the English creditors pari passu with those in New Zealand, sanctioned the acceptance of an undertaking by the solicitor for the English agent of the company that the English assets should remain in statu quo until the further order of the court.\nIn re Commercial Bank of India [L. R. 6 Eq. 517.] approved.\nKay J.\u2014I think that the court has jurisdiction to make a winding-up order upon a petition of this kind, otherwise there might be no means by which the English creditors could obtain payment of their debts ([4])\nAnd at page 230 :\nHad it not been then for the fact of a winding-up order existing in New Zealand this court would in my opinion have had jurisdiction to wind up this New Zealand company having an office and carrying on part of its business here as an unregistered company within the terms of the 199th section.\nThis being the case, what is the effect of the winding-up order which it is said has been made in New Zealand? This court, upon principles of international comity, would no doubt have great regard to that winding-up order and would be influenced thereby, but the question of jurisdiction is a different question and the mere existence of a winding-up order made by a foreign court does not take away the right of the courts of this country to make a winding-up order here, though it would, no doubt, exercise an influence upon this court in making the order. Having, therefore, jurisdiction to make a winding-up order I feel myself at liberty to sanction the acceptance of the undertaking offered by Mr. Hart. I have said thus much as to my own opinion upon the effect of the act. But there is the authority of In re Commercial Bank of India [L. R. 6 Eq. 517], in which counsel of eminence were engaged on both sides, Mr. Southgate, Q.C., Mr. Bristowe, and Mr. (now Lord Justice) Lindley being for the petitioners, and Mr. (now Lord Justice) Baggallay and Mr. Kekewich for the official liquidator of the new company. There a joint stock company formed in India, registered under Indian law, and having its principal place of business in India, with an agent and a branch office in England, was ordered to be wound up under the Act of 1862, and Lord Romilly said ([5]) \"I think I have jurisdiction to make the order; if the company is not wound up here these persons will not be able to get their money.\"\nNow that case was decided in 1889 and no authority against it has been cited.\nIn re Commercial Bank of South Australia ([6]) a bank incorporated in Australia, carrying on business there, and having a branch office in London with English companies and assets in England, it was held the English court had jurisdiction to make a winding-up order which would be ancillary to a winding-up in Australia. In this case the learned judge said, \" if I have control of the proceedings here, I will take care there shall be no conflict between the two courts.\"\nI think there is jurisdiction to make this winding-up order, which would be ancillary to the winding-up in Scotland for the purpose of getting in the Canadian assets and settling a list of the Canadian creditors, as in re Corsellis ([7]), the winding-up in England was ancillary to winding-up in Australia for the same purpose, and there need not be. and should not be any conflict between the two courts.\nIn the case of the Merchants Bank v. Gillespie ([8]), in the view I took of this case I considered it quite unnecessary to discuss or decide the question as to the extent of the power of the Dominion Parliament to pass laws for winding-up or otherwise dealing with foreign insolvent trading companies doing business in the Dominion, because I thought the then winding-up Act 45 Vic. ch. 23, was not intended to apply to a company incorporated under the Imperial Joint Stock Company's Acts, 1862-1867, and I was confirmed in that opinion by the action of the Dominion Parliament in passing the 1st section of the 47 Vic. ch. 39, which repealed the 1st section of 45 Vic. ch. 23 and substituted the 1st section of 47 Vic. m lieu thereof, the only alteration being the addition to the enumeration of the companies to which the 45 Vic. ch. 23 is to apply of the words \" which are doing business in Canada no matter where incorporated, \" and \" which are insolvent,\" covering it appeared to me a clear intimation that the 45 Vie. ch. 23, did not so apply. The question now raised in the present case is '. \"Was such addition within the legislative power of the Dominion Parliament, or in other words was such enactment ultra vires?\nIf parliament has legislate. respecting strictly foreign corporations, and is not to be considered to be legislating respecting colonial corporations unless they are expressly named, (see in re Oriental Inland steam Company([9]), surely it must be said that the Dominion Parliament can in its right to legislate in reference to bankruptcy and insolvency, legislate respecting insolvent companies doing business in Canada, and with reference to property of such companies within its jurisdiction.\nInasmuch then as-the Dominion statute declares that the winding-up act now applies to all companies which are doing business in Canada and no matter where incorporated, there can be no doubt of the intention of Parliament to apply the winding-up act to foreign as well as domestic incorporated companies, and as I think such an enactment is within the legislative power of the Dominion Parliament, and it being admitted that this company was carrying on its business, and held valuable lands in Canada, and was insolvent, and as the provisions of the English Companies Act, 1862, are held to apply to foreign companies carrying on business in England and are worked out as nearly as may be, or left not worked out as the exigencies of the case dealt with require; and inasmuch as the greater part of the assets of this company would seem to be in Canada, there is the more reason why the property within the territorial limits of the jurisdiction of the courts of Canada should be dealt with under the provisions of the Canadian act; in fact it is difficult to see how such property could be dealt with by the English liquidators; and inasmuch as in this case it appears the liquidators under the English Act are acting in concert with the liquidators under the Canadian act I can see no reason for supposing that any conflict can possibly arise whereby this stockholder can he in any way damnified; on the contrary, it appears to me that this is the most satisfactory way by which the company can be wound up and its assets realized for the benefit of the company and all the parties interested\nAll the winding-up act, as I understand it seeks to do in the case of foreign corporations is to protect and regulate the property in Canada and protect the rights of creditors of such corporation upon their property in Canada. It by no means follows that because all the provisions of the act may not be applicable to foreign cases that those portions which are should not be acted on.\nThe fact that liquidation proceedings have already been taken in Scotland under the Imperial Act, and that the Scotch liquidator acquiesces in the present proceed- confirmation de son opinion que l'acte 45 Vic. ch. 23, n'\u00e9tait pas applicable aux proc\u00e9d\u00e9s soumis \u00e0 la cour.\nMaintenant, si la question pouvait faire difficult\u00e9 avant l'amendement cet amendement a-t-il l'effet de la trancher en d\u00e9clarant que cet acte s'appliquerait aux compagnies faisant des affaires en Canada quelque soit le lien de leur incorporation? Pour moi, qui ai soutenu dans la cause de Merchants Bank of Halifax v. Gillespie, que la 45e Vic. ch 23 devait s'appliquer aux compagnies insolvables faisant affaires dans le pays et y poss\u00e9dant des biens, il me semble que cet amendement a eu l'effet de faire dispara\u00eetre toute difficult\u00e9 au sujet de l'application de la loi, et que l'on ne doit pas h\u00e9siter \u00e0 la d\u00e9clarer applicable aux compagnies \u00e9trang\u00e8res. Dans ce cas, il ne resterait \u00e0 d\u00e9cider que l'unique question soulev\u00e9e par l'appelant au sujet de la constitutionalit\u00e9 de la loi.\nLa compagnie dont ii s'agit a d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en liquidation en Ecosse, et la demande faite pour la soumettre au Winding up Act du pays a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite avec le consentement du liquidateur nomm\u00e9 par la cour en Ecosse, et les liquidateurs nomm\u00e9s ici l'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sur la demande des cr\u00e9anciers Canadiens et du liquidateur autoris\u00e9 en Ecosse.\nL'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s adopt\u00e9s dans cette instance sont soutenus par les autorit\u00e9s et il invoque la cause de la Commercial Bank of South Australia, ([10]). Cit\u00e9 comme autorit\u00e9 par Lindley on Company Law, 1889 ([11]) comme suit :\nBank incorporated and carried on business in Australia, not registered here but had a branch office in London. Winding up proceedings were pending in Australia,\u2014North J., made an order but expressed an opinion that the proceedings here should be ancillary to those in Australia, and that the liquidator should only deal with assets in this country. Compare Matheson Brothers, Limited, 27 Ch. D. 225. where no order was made. Lindley est encore cit\u00e9([12]) pour \u00e9tablir que les cours en Angleterre peuvent mettre en liquidation en vertu de l'acte imp\u00e9rial des compagnies coloniales ou \u00e9trang\u00e8res et quelles peuvent agir comme auxiliaires des cours coloniales pour les biens situ\u00e9s en Angleterre; pour quelle raison les cours canadiennes ne pourraient-elles pas en faire autant pour les cours anglaises en ce qui concerne les biens situ\u00e9s en Canada, et surtout comme dans le cas actuel, lorsqu'elles en seraient requises par la cour charg\u00e9e de la liquidation? Quoique les tribunaux soient independents les uns des autres, ils n'en sont cependant pas moins tenus de pr\u00eater le secours de leur autorit\u00e9 pour faire ex\u00e9cuter des lois qui ont pour but de r\u00e9gler des int\u00e9r\u00eats communs aux citoyens des deux pays.\nMais ind\u00e9pendamment de ce concours pour arriver \u00e0 la liquidation, je crois que l'action de nos tribunaux seule peut suffir pour arriver \u00e0 ce but. J'ai d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 cette opinion dans la cause du Merchants Bank of Halifax v. Gillespie ([13]), et je ne crois pas devoir revenir ici sur ce point.\nQuant \u00e0 la question de savoir si le parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral avait. le droit de passer les Winding up Acts, cela me semble ne faire aucune difficult\u00e9. La liquidation des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s et compagnies insolvables, tout comme les lois de faillites sont clairement du ressort du parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Notre parlement \u00e0 un pouvoir complet et absolu de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur ce sujet et n'est nullement dans la d\u00e9pendance du parlement imperial. Dans les limites de sa jurisdiction son pouvoir est \u00e9gal \u00e0 celui du parlement imp\u00e9rial. Cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 si souvent d\u00e9cid\u00e9e qu'il est inutile d'y revenir. C'est un point r\u00e9gl\u00e9.\nL'argument que l'acte du parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral est contraire \u00e0 l'acte imp\u00e9rial et partant nul est tout-a-fait sans fondement. Ii n'y a aucun acte du parlement imp\u00e9rial d\u00e9fendant \u00e0 notre parlement de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur cette mati\u00e8re; au contraire, il en existe un, l'acte de l'Am\u00e9rique Britannique du Nord, qui lui en donne tout sp\u00e9cialement ce pouvoir, cet la sec. 91, s. s. 21 de cet acte.\nPour annuler un acte du parlement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral il ne suffirait pas qu'il fut contraire \u00e0 la loi anglaise,\u2014mais il faudrait qu'il fut contraire \u00e0 une loi positive rendue obligatoire pour le Canada par disposition expresse, ou par une cons\u00e9quence n\u00e9cessaire de cette loi et encore cette nullit\u00e9 n aurait lieu que .pour les parties seulement de cette loi qui serait en contradiction directe \u00e0 celui du parlement imp\u00e9rial. Le juge Willes dans la cause de Philips v. Eyre ([14]) s'exprime ainsi sur cette question :\nIt was further argued that the Act in question was contrary to the principles of English Law, and therefore void. This is a vague expression and must mean either contrary to some positive law of England, or to some principle of natural justice, the violation of which would induce the Court to decline giving effect even to the law of a foreign Sovereign state. In the former point of view, it is clear that the lepugnancy to English law which avoids a colonial act means lepugnancy to an Imperial statute or order made by authority of such statute applicable to the Colony by express words or necessary intendment; and that, so far as such repugnancy extends, and no further, the Colonial act is void. The 28 & 29 Vict. C. 63 S. 2, enacts that, any Colonial law which is, or shall be, in any respect repugnant to the provisions of any Act of Parliament extending to the Colony to which such law may relate, or repugnant to any order or regulation made under authority of such Act of Parliament, or having in the Colony the force and effect of such Act shall be read subject to such Act, order or regulation, and shall, to the extent of such repugnancy, but not otherwise, be and remain absolutely void and inoperative.\nPour faire dispara\u00eetre tout doute la section 3 du m\u00eame acte d\u00e9clare que:\u2014\nNo Colonial law shall be or be deemed to have been, void or inoperative on the ground of repugnancy to the law of England, unless the same shall be repugnant to the provisions of some such Act of Parliament, order or regulation as aforesaid. Les actes imp\u00e9riaux concernant la liquidation des compagnies ne s'appliquent pas an Canada et ii est de principe que le parlement imp\u00e9rial ne l\u00e9gif\u00e8re pas sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 situ\u00e9e en dehors du Royaume-Uni. Ainsi cette l\u00e9gislation ne peut affecter la n\u00f4tre qui est parfaitement constitutionnelle et doit avoir son application autant qu'il est possible pour atteindre la liquidation demand\u00e9e.\nAppel renvoy\u00e9.\nGWYNEE J.\u2014I can add nothing to the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench, Sir A. A. Dorion. I entertain no doubt as to the correctness of that judgment, and am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2011The Scottish Canadian Asbestos Co. (limited), was incorporated on the 31st day of July, 1886, under the Imperial Companies' Acts, 1862 to 1886. Its registered office is in Glasgow, but its chief place of business is in the Province of Quebec where it owns real and personal property and has carried on the business of quarrying and working for asbestos.\nThe company being insolvent an order was made in November, 1888, by the Court of Session in Scotland, that the company be wound up under the provisions of the Companies' Act, and appointing a liquidator. The liquidator. by authority of the Court of Session, appointed the respondents, Hanson Brothers, for the purpose, amongst other things,\nfor and on behalf of me as liquidator aforesaid, to appear before and to apply to such Courts of Law in Canada aforesaid as my said attorneys and attorney shall deem necessary to have effect given to the order to wind up said company pronounced by the said Lords of Council and Session aforesaid, as also, if need be, to apply for an order to wind up said company in Canada, either as auxiliary to the Scotch liquidation or otherwise, or to consent to any such winding up.\nThe application to the court for leave to appoint the attorneys set out, and the power of attorney recited, that the company had its principal assets in Canada, and that considerable sums of money were due by the company to creditors resident in Canada. Thereupon a petition, in which the Scotch liquidator joined, was .presented to the Superior Court in the District of Arthabaska in Quebec, Mr. Justice Billy presiding. A winding-up order was made under the Canadian Statute (R. S. C. ch. 129) and Messrs. Hanson Brothers were appointed liquidators.\nThe appellant, who is a large shareholder in the company, moved against that order, and also to dissolve a meeting of creditors called under the statute. That motion was dismissed by Mr. Justice Billy, and his judgment was affirmed on appeal by the Court of Queen's Bench. The present appeal is from that decision.\nThe grounds of appeal are that the Canadian Winding-up act does not apply to this company, and that in so far as it professes to apply to the company it is ullru vires of the Parliament of Canada.\nThe first point is answered by the express language of the statute which declares, in section 3, that the act applies to incorporated trading companies doing business in Canada, wheresoever incorporated; and (a) which are insolvent; or (b) which are in liquidation or in process of being wound up, and on petition by any of their shareholders or creditors, assignees or liquidators ask to be brought under the provisions of this act.\nThis declaration, which was introduced into the Winding-up act after the proceedings in The Merchanta Bank of Halifax v. Gillespie ([15]) had been commenced, though before the judgment of the court was pronounced, alters the law from that which was held by a majority of the court to result from a correct interpretation of the act as it formerly stood, so that we can hold that foreign corporations are within the operation of the act without conflicting with the judgment which declared that they were not within its operation at the earlier date.\nThe question of ultra vires is, however, still undecided in this court, because, although it was advanced in The Merchants' Bank of Halifax v. Gillespie, ([16]) and opinions upon it were expressed by two of the learned judges who denied the jurisdiction and by one who affirmed it, it was not pronounced upon by the court.\nTwo points are made against the existence of the legislative jurisdiction. It is argued that it is conclusively negatived by the Imperial statute, 29 & 30 Vic. ch. 63, which declares, in section 2, that any colonial law which is or shall be in any respect repugnant to the provisions of any act of Parliament extending to the colony to which such law may relate, or repugnant to any order or regulation made under the authority of such Act of Parliament, or having in the colony the force and effect of such act, shall be read subject to such act, order or regulation, and shall to the extent of such repugnancy, but not otherwise, be and remain absolutely void and inoperative,.\nTo sustain this objection two things are essential. The Imperial Act of Parliament must extend to the Dominion, and the Dominion Winding-up Act must be repugnant to the Imperial Companies' Act.\nI do not think the appellant has succeeded in maintaining either of these propositions. The first section of the statute of 29-30 Vic. ch. 63 which is the interpretation clause, declares that an act of parliament or any provision thereof shall, in construing that act, be said to extend to any colony when it is made applicable to such colony by the express words or necessary intendment of any act of parliament.\nThere are certainly no express words contained in the Companies' Act of 1862, or in any of the amending acts, extending their provisions to Canada, or to any of the provinces comprised in the Dominion, and it is equally difficult to trace in their provisions an intendment that they shall so apply. On the contrary we find the provisions relating to practice and procedure in winding-up proceedings framed with exclusive reference to the British Islands. A distinct instance of this is afforded by section 122 of the act of 1862, which provides for enforcing in any one of the three divisions of the United Kingdom orders made in the course of any other division, but makes no allusion to enforcing such orders in any colony.\nThe Companies' Acts, therefore, do not extend to Canada. Nor is there any repugnancy between their provisions and the power now questioned of making a winding-up order by a Canadian court in the matter of an English or Scotch company which does business in Canada, has a place of business here, owes debts here, and has assess here. To hold such an order repugnant to the English acts would be to question the cases, of which there is a consistent series in which the English courts have made orders to wind up colonial companies, or, as in one case, have asserted the power while refusing, as an exercise of discretion, to make the order. See In re Union Bank of Calcutta ([17]); in re Commercial Bank of India ([18]); in re Commercial Bank of South Australia ([19]);in re Matheson Brothers ([20]); Westlake's Private International Law ([21]); Thring on Joint Stock and other companies ([22]); Lindley on Company Law ([23]). See also judgement of my brother Fournier in Merchants' Bank of Halifax v. Gillespie ([24]), which is for the most part applicable to this case, and in which I entirely concur.\nIt is true that our course cannot exercise with regard to an English company the full extent of the powers conferred by our Winding-up Act. For example, they cannot, by the effect of a winding-up order, affect the P operations of the company m England, causing it to cease to carry on its business there as under section 15 the company must do in this country. But the same difficulty was presented when the English courts were asked to make orders to wind up colonial companies, and was held not to affect the jurisdiction. See particularly the observations of Mr Justice Kay in re Matheson Brothers ([25]), and of Mr. Justice North in re Commercial Bank of South Australia ([26]).\nThe fallacy in this particular may perhaps have been contributed to by an idea that an order called a Windingup order, made in pursuance of an act called a Winding-up Act, must be inoperative if, in its potential effect, it must stop short of winding up or dissolving the company.\nThe expression usually employed in our statute is \" winding up the business of the company,\" though the phrase t the winding up of the company,\" is sometimes used as e g. in section 42 ([27]). The terms are convertible and the former readily adapts itself to the operation of the order now in question, which is to wind up the business carried on by the company in Canada though our course may be as powerless as the English courts find themselves in dealing with colonial companies, to dissolve the corporation or to administer the assets that are beyond the territorial limits of their jurisdiction.\nSome extracts from the company's articles of association have been put in evidence, and an argument against the jurisdiction of the Canadian court has been based on section 125, which reads as follows :\nIf the directors shall pass a resolution recommending the company . to be dissolved, and a general meeting shall in pursuance of such recommendation resolve that the company be dissolved, and a second general meeting shall confirm that resolution, then the company shall henceforth subsist and carry on business for the purpose of winding-up its affairs, and its affairs shall be wound up and it shall be dissolved in accordance with and subject to the provisions of \"The Companies' Acts, 1862 to 1883,\" which are and may be applicable in the voluntary winding-up of a company under the same, or the occurrence of an event in which it is provided that a company under the same may be wound up voluntarily.\nOne has only to read this to see that it cannot affect the present contest. It is a contract among the remedies. of the company, and deals only with a voluntary winding-up which may be brought about in a specified manner. There is no pretence of dictating to the creditors of the company what remedies they may employ or what forum they must resort to to enforce their remedies.\nOn these grounds, and without thinking it necessary to discuss the recognition of the company by the issue of letters patent in the province of Quebec, or the effect of the Scotch liquidator being a party to the proceedings here, I am of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant : MacLaren, Leek, Smith & Smith.\nSolicitors for respondents : Taylor & Buchan.\n[1] 16 Q.L.R. 79; S.C. 13 Legal News, 129.\n[2] 16 Q.

C.\nHeld, affirming the judgments of the courts below, that when a testamentary executrix employs an agent as attorney, she is bound to supervise his management of the matters entrusted to him and to take all due precautions and cannot escape liability for the misappropriation of funds committed by such agent, although he was a notary public of excellent standing prior to the misappropriation\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) (1), confirming in part a judgment of the Superior Court (1), and ordering the reformation of certain accounts rendered by the defendant in her capacity as executrix of the will of the late Charles Adamson Low; and also condemning the defendant, personally, to pay to the plaintiff, in her quality of tutrix to the minor children of her deceased husband Geo. H. Low , the sum ch $17,914.11, being made up of certain amounts .misappropriated by one J. S. Hunter, who acted as notary and agent for the estate.\nThe action was brought by the respondent Dame A. J. Gemley in her quality of tutrix to the four minor children issue of her marriage with the late George Hamilton Low, against the appellant Dame A. S. Low as executrix of the will of the late Charles Adamson Low, to obtain the reformation of the accounts rendered to her by the executrix, and the pay nient of the children's share of the testator's estate as established by the accounts and by the corrections which the tutrix sought to introduce therein.\nThe items in the accounts rendered alleged to have been misappropriated, by Mr. J. S. Hunter, N. P. were as follows :--\nLoaned to Mrs.Emma Roussell\n$2916.81\n\" \" Mrs.John Clark\n1,000.00\n\" \" Joseph Bouchard\n3,000.00\n\" \" Est. C. Phillips\n10,997.30\n$17,914.11\nThe judgment of the Superior Court ordered the rectification of the accounts according to the plaintiff's pretensions and condemned the defendant in her quality of executrix to hand over to the tutrix the portion of the estate comprised in the accounts, and personally to pay the amounts which should have been placed to the credit of the minors in these accounts.\nAn appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench was, taken by the executrix, and during the pendency of this appeal one of the minors whom the tutrix represented, Miss Maud H. Low attained her majoritv and obtained leave to take up and continue the proceedings on her own behalf.\nThe executrix met the action brought by the tutrix by a two-fold defence. She contended that the accounts as rendered were correct and she further urged that in any event the tutrix could not claim the possession or control the capital of her wards' estate until the attainment of the age of majority of one of the children, in view of the provisions of the will which were alleged to place the estate under the control of trustees until the fulfilment of this condition. When Miss Maud Low came of age and obtained leave to continue the proceedings in her own behalf, this second defence became unavailing, and the executrix declared to the Court of Queen's Bench by her factum, that she had no objection to pay to Miss Maud Low such portion of the estate as might be found to be due to her as one of the legatees under the will.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench unanimously confirmed the judgment of the Superior Court as regards the correction ordered to be made in the accounts and the payment of the children's revenues to the tutrix, but adopted the appellant's interpretation of the will as to the right of the trustees to retain the control of the capital against the tutrix until the majority of the children. In view of the fact that Miss Maud Low attained her majority during the proceedings, and of the declaration made by the appellant, the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench ordered the executrix to pay to Miss Maud Low her share of the estate as established by the corrected accounts.\nThe respondents accepted this judgment in toto and the appellant has acquiesced in a portion of the judgment by filing a consent that it should be executed in so far as it orders the payment to Miss Maud Low of her share of the capital and revenue of the estate admitted by the executrix in her accounts as rendered.\nThe circumstances under which the moneys in question were misappropriated fully appear m the reports of the case in the courts below (1) and in the judgment hereinafter given.\nH. Abbott Q.C. for appellant, and Lafleur for respondents.\nThe points of argument and cases and authorities relied on by counsel are given at length in the report of the case of the Court of Queen's Bench (1). The judgment of the court was delivered by\u2014\u2014\nSir W. J. Ritchie C.J.\u2014As to the merits we have to deal with the important question of the responsibility of executors for the funds in their hands under the circumstances of such a case as this.\nThe first thing will be to see what it was precisely that the defendant did. The evidence shows first that on 1st November, 1875, Mrs. Lawford handed over to Hunter $2,916.81 to invest on mortgage from Emma Roussel. No mortgage was ever executed, and the money was appropriated by Hunter, who seems to have paid the interest on the supposed mortgage to Mrs. Lawford out of his own pocket.\nOn 1st December, 1880, a sum of $8,000 which had been loaned to Mrs. Joseph Bouchard and secured by a mortgage on real estate became due. Mrs. Lawford signed a receipt and acquitance bearing that date, which is filed with the record.\nNo proof is offered to explain the disappearance of this money, but defendant can only suggest that when she signed the receipt she imagined that she was signing an extension of the mortgage.\nOn 6th July, 1877, Mrs. Lawford handed Hunter $1,000 to invest on mortgage from Mrs. John Clarke. No such mortgage was ever executed or registered, and the money was appropriated by Hunter, who paid interest on the supposed investment out of his own pocket.\nOn 20th February, 1882, Mrs. Lawford handed Hunter $20,576.60, to be used in payment of assessments due by the estate Philips, and held partly by Robert Hamilton and partly by the city, from whom subrogation was to be obtained. On 28th February, 1882, Mrs. Lawford signed a subrogation for $9,579.30. Hunter appropriated the balance of 10,997.30, and defendant can only suggest that when she signed the deed she imagined it was for the whole amount.\nThe question will be whether, all this money having been lost by the misconduct of Hunter, the defendant has any lawful excued for not paying it to the plaintiff \u00e9s qual.\nIt is abundantly clear that trust money ought not necessarily to be left with strangers.\nIn this case it is beyond question that the executrix placed herself completely in the hands of Hunter dele-gating to him the confidence reposed in herself, placing the most implicit confidence in him, acquiescing without question or investigation in all the pro-posed, accepting his statements without any inquiry as to their correctness, and generally without exercising any surveillance or control over the money to be in-vested, or without any inquiry as to whether the investments had been made or the security properly executed and registered before the money to be in-vested in the securities was paid over, but gave him the absolute control of such moneys by drawing checks payable to him personally when no necessity existed for such a course being adopted and when if such checks had been drawn in favor of the borrowers or their order it could not have been in his power to have perpetrated the gross frauds of which he appears to have been guilty in this case. it was, however, stated in the evidence that the plaintiff was a woman who professed to possess a certain knowledge of business; if she does it is quite clear that she failed to put any such knowledge in practice, but on the contrary, without any direction, supervision, inquiry or superintendence, in a blind confidence, she placed the moneys of this estate in the hands of this man who fraudulently appropriated the same to his own use. Now who should be the sufferers by this rascality? Should it be the executrix who by an entire abandonment of her control over these funds, and of her duties as executrix, and substituting in her stead the author ' of those wrongs and needlessly placing m his hands the moneys of the estate thereby enabling him to perpetrate them, and whose only answer practically is: \"I had such confidence in him that I did not believe he could do wrong \";or the infant children of the testator\u00bb guilty of no improper conduct or wrong ?\nI think this executrix cannot be considered m any other light than as guilty of culpable negligence. I cannot conceive any system of law recognising the duties of executors that would throw such a loss as this case develops on the devisees and relieve the negligent executor from all liability. No doubt when Hunter was perpetrating these frauds and until his flight his reputation was unquestioned and he enjoyed public confidence and esteem. No doubt he was an ancient friend of the Low family and appears to have been particularly so of the plaintiff, but this case is not to be decided on sentiment. What we have todo with are the business relations of the plaintiff as executrix with the notary Hunter, and in those relations did she exercise that due care and control over the interests of the estate and that surveillance over the transactions in question, that her duty as executrix and her duty to the estate demanded ?\nI can discover no substantial difference between the French and English law on the question at issue in this case. I have not thought necessary to go into the authorities French or English, because I think the principle involved in the case is too clearly established to require that I should do so.\nThe law applicable to this case is clearly stated in Clough v. Bond (1). It was held by Lord Cottenham, affirming the decree of Sir L. Shadwell V.C., (reported 8 Sim. 594 nom. Clough v. Dixon), that the estate of John Bond was answerable for the loss\nIt will be found, \"said his lordship,\" to be the result of all the best authorities upon the subject., that, although a personal representative, acting strictly within the line of his duty, and exercising reasonable care and diligence, will not be responsible for the failure or depreciation of the fund in which any part of the estate may be invested, or for the insolvency or misconduct of any person who may have possessed it; yet, if that line of duty be not strictly pursued, and any part of the property be invested by such personal representative in funds or upon securities not authorized, or be put within the control of persons who ought not to be entrusted with it, and a loss be thereby eventually sustained, such personal representative will be liable to make it good, however unexpected the result, however little likely to arise from the course adopted, and however free such conduct may have been from any improper motive.\nSo when the loss arises from the dishonesty or failure of any one to whom the possession of part of the estate has been intrusted Necessity, which includes the regular course of business in administering the property, will in equity exonerate the personal representative. But if, without such necessity, he be instrumental in giving, to the person failing, possession of any part of the property, he will be liable, al-though the person possessing it be a co-executor or co-administrator : Langford v. Gasooyne (1) Lord Shipbrook v. Lord Hinchinbrook (1) Underwood v. SteVens (1).\nThis case does not come at all within the case of Speight v. Gaunt (1), which, in my opinion, is entirely distinguishable from it\nPersons who accept the office of executors or trustees must be supposed to accept it with the responsibility at all events for the possession of ordinary care and prudence. Learoyd v. Whiteley (2), per Lord Halsbury.\nAppeal dismissed with costs\nSolicitors for appellants: Abbotss, Campbell & Meredith.\nSolicitors for respondent : Lafleur & Rielle.\n"

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of MacMahon J. at the trial in favor of the defendants.\nThe defendants were co-executors and trustees under a will of what was known as the Jantz estate. The defendant Wismer was the active trustee and he received certain monies of the estate which he applied to his own purposes. He had been a farmer but bought the interest of a partner in a milling business and gave a statement of his means to the plaintiff bank in order that his firm might obtain a line of credit to carry on the business. In a little more than a year the firm became insolvent and Wismer gave to his cotrustee a second mortgage on certain property to secure the estate money which he had appropriated. No assignment for the general benefit of creditors was made by the firm or by Wismer and the bank having obtained a judgment against Wismer took proceedings to have the said mortgage set aside as being a fraudulent preference under the statute R.S.O. (1877) ch. 124 sec. 2. The trial judge refused to set it aside and gave judgment for the defendants which the Court of Appeal affirmed. The decision of the latter court was based on the ground that the parties did not stand in the relation of the debtor and creditor and there could, therefore, be no preference and that an intent to defeat or delay creditors must still be shown to avoid a preference under the statute which was not done. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nBowlby Q.C. for the appellants. R.S.O ch. 124, sec. 2, makes void every transfer of property which has the effect of defeating or delaying creditors.\nThe relation of debtor and creditor undoubtedly existed between the Jantz estate and Wismer. Ex parte Taylor. In re Goldsmid[2], followed in Ex parte Ball. In re Hutchinson[3]; In re Mills. Ex parte The Official Receiver[4].\nThe mortgage is clearly void under the statute. McDonald v. McCall[5]; Davis v. Wickson[6]; Warnock v. Kloepfer[7] affirmed by the Supreme Court on appeal; Rider v. Kidder[8].\nAytoun-Finlay and Duvernet for the respondents. The judgment of the plaintiffs is against Wismer personally, and cannot be enforced against him as executor. Allen v. McTavish[9]; Lucas v. Crookshank[10].\nThe statute only applies to voluntary assignments, McLean v. Garland[11]; Long v. Hancock[12]; and there was clearly pressure on Wismer to give this mortgage.\nSTRONG J.\u2014The question presented for decision by this appeal is whether a mortgage of lands made by one of several executors to his co-executors as security for money belonging to his testator\u2019s estate, wrongfully appropriated by him, is void by reason of the mortgagor\u2019s insolvency when he executed the mortgage.\nThe solution of this question depends, in the first place, upon the construction to be placed upon section 2 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1887, ch. 124, which is as follows:\u2014\nEvery * * * conveyance * * * of * * * any * * * property, real or personal, made by a person at a time when he is in insolvent circumstances, or is unable to pay his debts in full, or knows that he is on the eve of insolvency, with intent to defeat, delay or prejudice his creditors, or to give to any one or more of them a preference over his other creditors or over any one or more of them, or which has such effect, shall as against them be utterly null and void. The appellants have contended before this court, as they also contended before the Court of Appeal, that in construing this enactment the words \u201cor which has such effect,\u201d are not to be confined to the immediately antecedent case, that avoiding preferences, but are also to be applied to the first case comprised in the section, that of conveyances made to defeat, delay or prejudice creditors, and that, consequently, as the effect of the mortgage here has been, in fact, to defeat and prejudice the appellants as judgment creditors of Wismer, the mortgagor, it is, irrespective altogether of the intent with which it was given, void as against the appellants. The Court of Appeal, by a majority of three to one, Mr. Justice Osler being the dissentient judge, decided against this contention. The Chief Justice of Ontario and Mr. Justice Burton both held, in the learned judgments delivered by them, that the words \u201cor which has such effect,\u201d are to be confined to the case of preferences, and Mr. Justice MacLennan concurred in the judgment of the Chief Justice; Mr. Justice Osler, on the other hand, based his dissenting judgment on the construction which attributes the words in question to both the cases dealt with by the section and therefore held that, without regard to the intent with which it was made, the mortgage by Wismer to his co-executors to secure the moneys of the testator\u2019s estate which he had appropriated to his own use was void. If intent to defeat creditors is required to be proved to bring a case within the first part of the section it is manifest that the appellants must fail so far as regards the contention now under consideration.\nIn the first place I entirely agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal in attributing the words \u201cor which has such effect\u201d to the case of preferences exclusively. Many unimpeachable authorities have established that in interpreting statutes the rule of grammatical construction is to govern unless the context, indicating that a different intent actuated the legislature, requires a departure from that rule, or unless some absurdity, injustice or great inconvenience would be the result of adherence to it. So well established is this rule that it has been called by very great judges the \u201cgolden rule,\u201d and we find it approved and applied to numerous cases, some of them decided in the House of Lords. One of the instances of the application of this principle is that which occurs in the construction of relative words and a subordinate rule, formulated in a well known legal maxim, has been adopted as a canon of construction in such cases. This maxim, ad proximum antecedent fiat relatio nisi impediatur sententia, is, therefore, that which is primarily to be applied in the present case, and we are not entitled to disregard it or to depart from it unless its effect will be to bring the clause of the statute we are dealing with within some of the exceptions to the general principle of literal, grammatical construction. Then can it be said that the interpretation of this section adopted by the Court of Appeal in accordance with the maxim just referred to, by confining the words \u201cor has such effect,\u201d or rather the relative word \u201csuch\u201d in that sentence, to that part of the section concerning preferences which immediately precedes, introduces any of those consequences which are said to indicate that the rule is inapplicable? I am of opinion that it cannot be so said. It is impossible to say that such a meaning is at variance with any context, or that it involves either absurdity or injustice, or that it is repugnant to anything to be found either in this specific clause or in other parts of the statute. I have heard and can conceive nothing which would lead to these results and, therefore, I am of opinion that we must refer the words \u201csuch effect\u201d to the next antecedent, \u201ca preference over his other creditors,\u201d a construction which is in accord, not only with the literal and grammatical meaning, but which is also consistent with reason, good sense and legal convenience, and which does not conflict with any contrary intent of the legislature disclosed by the context. If, on the other hand, we were to apply these referential words to the first part of the section, and hold that a conveyance tending to prejudice creditors, though made with the most honest and praiseworthy intentions, was void, and that, too, even as regards bon\u00e2 fide purchasers, such as a creditor innocently taking a conveyance in satisfaction of his debt, or parties claiming under an ante-nuptial settlement made and accepted in good faith and without notice of any fraudulent intent, we should, I think, be attributing to the statute an operation which would not merely be novel and startling but which would be positively unjust.\nTherefore, I am of opinion that the validity of the impeached mortgage must depend exclusively on the answer to be made to the inquiry whether or not the mortgage is proved to have been made with intent to give a preference to particular creditors over the appellants or over the general body of creditors, or whether it has had such effect, which is the case secondly provided for by the enactment in question. No question of statutory construction arises here; the section construed in the manner already indicated is, in my opinion, perfectly plain and unambiguous. The question we have to determine is, in the abstract, whether a conveyance or mortgage by a defaulting trustee to his co-trustees, made when the defaulter is in a state of insolvency with the object and intent of making good to the trust estate monies which he has abstracted from the trust fund and appropriated to his own use, is to be considered a preference of one creditor to another or as having the effect of such a preference within this second section. Again concurring with the learned judges who formed the majority in the Court of Appeal I am of opinion that the answer to this must be in the negative for the reason that the persons for whose benefit the security was given were not creditors within the meaning of this section of the statute but have rights higher than those of creditors. The English cases are conclusive on the point. Ex parte Stubbins re Wilkinson[13] and ex parte Taylor re Goldsmid[14], and ex parte Kelly[15], all decide that the doctrine of fraudulent preference has no application to such a state of facts as we find disclosed by the evidence in the present case. As the Master of the Rolls observed in the case of ex parte Taylor[16], the relationship between the defaulting party and those who get the benefit of the conveyance or mortgage in such cases is not that of debtor and creditor at all but that of trustee and cestui qui trust, and consequently the enactments in the bankruptcy statutes against preferences do not include the case in question. The reasoning of these cases is so satisfactory, and the disastrous consequences of a contrary construction so obvious, that I need not say more on this head. The English authorities already quoted are precisely in point, and no reason has been, or can be, suggested why they should not be acted upon here.\nThere is, however, still another reason why, even in the absence of these English cases, I should, on a different ground, have come to the same conclusion. As Lord Cairns, in the case of Butcher v. Stead[17], has laid it down the word \u201cpreference\u201d imports a voluntary preference, that is to say, a spontaneous act of the debtor. There was nothing new in this explanation of the term; it was a very old principle of the law of bankruptcy, though it was stated by Lord Cairns more clearly and decisively, and in a more absolute form, than it had ever before been formulated in. Then could it be said that the giving a security by Wismer for this money which he had abstracted from the assets of his testator and fraudulently applied to his own use was a mere voluntary act on his part? Surely not in view of the state of our criminal law, which renders such a defaulting trustee liable to prosecution, and on conviction to personal punishment. It is held that a mere demand is sufficient pressure by a creditor to take away from a conveyance, transfer or mortgage the character of an unjust preference, and if the pressure of the creditor is thus sufficient to show that such a transaction is not a voluntary preference, how much more effectual for that purpose should be the pressure caused by the consciousness of the trustee, that if he fails to make good his abstractions from the fund he will subject himself to penal consequences. In such a case it could never be said that the act of restoration, if impeached as a preference, was voluntary or spontaneous, or made otherwise than under the weight of the heaviest pressure to which the defaulter could be subjected. As I have said, pressure by the creditor in the case of a common debt divests a transfer of any fraudulent color, and in the case of the trustee, such as we have here, the law itself, by recognizing the restitution of a trust fund as a higher duty enforced by a higher statutory sanction than the payment of an ordinary debt, exerts the pressure which takes away from the transaction the character of a voluntary preference.\nUpon this last ground alone I should be prepared to hold that the mortgage impugned by this section was neither an illegal preference nor a security having the effect of such a preference.\nAlthough in the view which I take it is not material that I should be able to assign any particular meaning to the words \u201cor has such effect,\u201d I may add that I should find no difficulty in doing so. It appears to me that they have a perfectly plain and obvious meaning. They are, in my opinion, redundant words inserted by the draftsman, ex abundanti cautel\u00e2, to show that not merely direct preferences, such as would result where an impeached mortgage or conveyance was made directly by the debtor to the creditors, they being the only and immediate parties to the transaction, were intended to be prohibited, but that preferences which might be the consequences of indirect and circuitous forms which might be given to transfers of property made through persons interposed between the debtor and creditor were also intended to be included.\nSo used they were probably unnecessary and superfluous, but their use for such a purpose was quite in conformity with the style generally adopted in drafting legislative acts.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nFOURNIER J. was of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred with STRONG J.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The determination of this case turns upon the true construction to be put upon sec. 2 of the Ontario Statute, 48 Vic. ch. 26\u2014which is now consolidated with other acts in ch. 124 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario. The frequent revision of the statutes and the mode adopted for effecting these revisions are, in my opinion, calculated to conceal, and to distract the attention from the consideration of the object which the legislature had in view in originally enacting the provision of the law for the time being under consideration. This 2nd section of 48 Vic. ch. 26 was passed by way of substitution for the 2nd section of ch. 118 R.S.O., 1877, and the effect was to make this section, so substituted, to be thenceforth read as the 2nd section of said ch. 118, the title of which act is: \u201cAn act respecting the fraudulent preference of creditors by persons in insolvent circumstances.\u201d We have thus, as it appears to me, a clear enunciation by the legislature of their intention in enacting this 2nd section of 48 Vic. ch. 26 to be to provide against persons in insolvent circumstances transferring any property for the purpose of defrauding their creditors, or giving to any of their creditors a fraudulent preference over any other creditor. The section enacts that\u2014\nEvery gift, conveyance, assignment, or transfer, delivery over, or payment of any goods, chattels or effects, or of any shares, dividends, premiums or bonus in any bank company or corporation, or of any other property, real or personal, made by any person at a time when he is in insolvent circumstances, or is unable to pay his debts in full, or knows that he is on the eve of insolvency, with intent to defeat, delay or prejudice his creditors, or to give to any one or more of them a preference over his other creditors or over any one or more of them, or which has such effect, shall as against them be utterly void.\nWhat the draftsman of this section intended by the words at its close, \u201cor which has such effect,\u201d I do not think was very clear to his own mind. To my mind, I must say that they do not appear to have the effect of changing the nature of the inquiry which would have been necessary, or of extending the operation of the section beyond what it would have effected if these words had been omitted. Prior to the passing of 48 Vic. ch. 26, if a deed had been assailed under ch. 118 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario upon the ground of its being fraudulent as against the creditors of the grantor as having been executed by him with intent to defeat, delay or prejudice them in obtaining satisfaction of their debts out of the property conveyed by the deed to the extent of the value of such property, the inquiry into that subject necessarily opened the question of the consideration upon and for which the deed had been executed; and if it appeared that the deed was purely voluntary upon the part of the grantor, without any good and valuable consideration having been given by or on behalf of the grantee or other person on whose behalf and for whose benefit the deed was executed, the natural and necessary effect of such a deed was to defeat, delay and prejudice the creditors of the grantor, and so the fraud charged was established, namely, that the deed was executed by the grantor with the intent that it should have that effect which was the natural and necessary effect of its being executed; but if it should, on the contrary, appear that the deed was executed for a good, valuable, legal consideration, proceeding from the grantee or person in whose favor or for whose benefit the deed was executed, such good consideration operating to support the deed and to pass the title in the property conveyed to such person, the necessary result was that no fraud against the grantor\u2019s creditors had been committed, and the deed could not be held to have had the effect of depriving the creditors of any property which they had any right to reach to obtain thereout satisfaction of their debts in whole or in part. Thus we see that the question as to the intent with which the deed was executed was subsidiary to, and involved in, the question as to what was the consideration upon and for which the deed was executed. If the consideration given was good and valuable, and given bon\u00e2 fide, the deed could not be said to have the effect of defeating or delaying the grantor\u2019s creditors nor could the grantor be said to have executed the deed with the intent that it should have an effect which, in point of law, it could not, under the circumstances, be said to have; in short the question as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the deed to pass the title thereby purported to be conveyed, and the question as to what was the effect of the deed, and what the intent with which it had been executed, were all involved in the one question, namely: Was the consideration upon and for which the deed was executed a good valid and bon\u00e2 fide consideration for the purpose of vesting the title of the property according to the terms of the deed, or, on the contrary, was the deed a purely voluntary deed executed without any consideration bon\u00e2 fide given and proceeding from the person in whose behalf or for whose benefit it was executed? Now, if a deed should be assailed since the passing of 48 Vic. ch. 26 as fraudulent against the creditors of the grantor upon the allegation that it defeated or delayed or prejudiced them in the recovery of their debts, the evidence, I apprehend, must be of precisely the same nature as had been necessary before the passing of the act, and the consideration upon and for which the deed was executed is still, equally as before, the crucial test to determine whether the deed was sufficient to pass the title bon\u00e2 fide to the grantee of the deed, or whether, on the contrary, it was a purely voluntary deed, and so having the effect as charged of defeating, delaying and prejudicing the grantor\u2019s creditors in the recovery of their debts. Assuming, then, the words, \u201cor which has such effect\u201d to be coupled with the words, \u201cwith intent to defeat, delay or prejudice his creditors\u201d as well as with the words with which they are immediately connected, namely, \u201cor to give to any one or more of them a preference over his other creditors, or over any one or more of them,\u201d it does not appear to me that thereby any material difference is made in the law, either as to the nature of the deed, which is open to the imputation of being one which, operating so as to defeat, delay, or prejudice the grantor\u2019s creditors, is fraudulent as against them, or as to the nature of the evidence as to the consideration which is sufficient to sustain the deed, and to relieve it from such imputation of fraud. The whole question is still as before involved in an inquiry into the precise character and sufficiency of the consideration upon and for which the deed was in truth executed. The suggestion that the effect of the words, \u201cor which has such effect,\u201d coupled with the words, \u201cwith intent to defeat, delay, or prejudice his creditors,\u201d is to make them operate in two distinct events, namely: First, to avoid a deed executed with intent to defeat, delay or prejudice the grantor\u2019s creditors, whether the deed should or should not have, or in other words, although it should not have, such effect; and second, to avoid the deed which had the effect of defeating, delaying or prejudicing the grantor\u2019s creditors, although he executed the deed bon\u00e2 fide for good and valuable consideration without any such intent, cannot, in my opinion, be entertained for a moment. It is impossible to attribute to the legislature so motiveless and senseless an intention as that a deed should be avoided as prejudicial and fraudulent as against creditors, as defeating or delaying or prejudicing them in the recovery of their debts, which had not any such effect, upon the ground that the grantor is assumed to have vainly intended that the deed should have an effect which ex premissis it had not. Every deed executed by an insolvent purely voluntarily and without consideration is regarded in law as well as in fact as having the effect of defeating, delaying and prejudicing the creditors of the insolvent grantor; the only deed, therefore, executed by an insolvent not having such effect must be a deed executed bon\u00e2 fide for good and valuable consideration; and neither justice nor common sense, in my opinion, justifies the contention that the legislature, by the language used, contemplated declaring void as fraudulent, as against the grantor\u2019s creditors, a deed executed by him, bon\u00e2 fide, for good and valuable consideration proceeding from the person to whom, or in whose favor, and for whose benefit the deed was executed. Such a great change in the law which such a construction of the language used, so pregnant itself with fraud, would effect cannot, in my opinion, be attributed to the language used by the legislature.\nWhile I am of opinion that the words under consideration have no such effect I concur with the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, in the opinion that the words \u201cor which has such effect,\u201d are to be construed only in connection with the sentence immediately preceding\u2014thus: \u201cor to give to any one or more of them a preference over his other creditors, or over any one or more of them, or which has such effect.\u201d If the intention had been to apply these words in connection also with the words, \u201cwith intent to defeat, delay or prejudice his creditors,\u201d the natural expression would have been, \u201cor which has any of such effects,\u201d for there had been several effects involved in the two sentences, namely, the effect of defeating, the effect of delaying, the effect of prejudicing the grantor\u2019s creditors generally, and the very different effect, namely, the effect of preferring one or more of his creditors over others; but construing the words in connection with the immediately preceding words\u2014\u201cor to give to any one or more of his creditors a preference over his other creditors, or over one or more of them,\u201d there is not the slightest indication that the legislature intended, in 48 Vic. ch. 26, to use the terms, \u201cpreference,\u201d and \u201cto give a preference,\u201d in any other sense than the well understood legal sense of those terms as the same had been in use before the passing of the act. Indeed, on the contrary, the enacting of the 2nd sec. of 48 Vic. ch. 26, in substitution for the 2nd sec. of ch. 118 R.S.O., 1877, the title of which act is as above stated, indicates very plainly, I think, that the legislature used the terms in their well understood legal sense, namely, the fraudulent preference given by an insolvent to one or more of his creditors over others. It is, therefore, as material since the passing of 48 Vic. ch. 26 as it was before to inquire what species of conveyance was assailable as giving a preference to one of the creditors of an insolvent over others. A preference of one creditor over others consisted, and, in my opinion, still consists, in the voluntary disposition by an insolvent of some portion of his property so as to confer greater benefit upon one or more of his creditors than upon others, when unable to pay all in full. To constitute a preference it must have been given by the insolvent of his own mere motion, and as a favor or bounty proceeding voluntarily from himself.\nIf, for example, a person in insolvent circumstances should execute a deed conveying a portion of his property to one of his creditors in order to get the remainder of his property released from the operation of an execution in the sheriff\u2019s hands as against his property generally, or if in a suit in chancery by one of his creditors to compel specific performance of a contract relating to a portion of his property the insolvent should be decreed specifically to perform such contract by conveying to such creditor the particular property in question, in neither of those cases could a creditor of the insolvent assail successfully the convey- ance as constituting a preference of one creditor over his other creditors, either before or since the passing of 48 Vic. ch. 26, for the reason that such deeds must be regarded as having been executed by compulsion of law and for good consideration, and not for the purpose of effecting a voluntary disposition of any part of the grantor\u2019s property as a benefit conferred upon one of his creditors over the others.\nSo likewise, as it appears to me, if an insolvent should transfer property to one of his creditors for the purpose of specifically performing a contract which the creditor could enforce by process of law, although no suit had been instituted for that purpose, such transfer would not constitute a giving a preference by the insolvent to such creditor within the meaning of the statute; an act, specific performance of which could have been enforced by law, could not, I apprehend, have been considered to be, before the passing of 48 Vic. ch. 26, what the law regarded as a preference given to one of an insolvent\u2019s creditors over the others; and as the 48 Vic. ch. 26, makes no difference as to the character of the act which constitutes a preference, but uses that term in its well known legal sense, a disposition of property by an insolvent which did not, before the act, constitute a preference of one creditor over others cannot be adjudged to be a preference within the meaning of 48 Vic. ch. 26.\nUpon the whole, therefore, I can see no reason why the English decisions upon a similar question to that arising here are not as applicable to the determination of the present case as to like cases arising in England; and upon the authority of Ex parte Kelly. In re Smith[18], Ex parte Stubbins. In re Wilkinson[19], and Ex parte Taylor. In re Goldsmid[20], and upon principle, I am of opinion that a conveyance, such as the one in question, executed by one of two trustees to his co-trustee to reinstate a fund of their cestui que trust which had been misappropriated by the former trustee in breach of his trust is not a conveyance which can be avoided under the Ontario statutes relating to assignments and preferences by insolvent persons, either upon the contention that it operates as fraudulent to the insolvent\u2019s trustees creditors generally, or as a preference to one of his creditors.\nTo such a transaction the Ontario statute has, in my opinion, no application, and the appeal, therefore, should be dismissed with costs.\nPATTERSON J.\u2014The essential facts in this appeal are few and are not now in dispute.\nHalter and Wismer were executors of Jantz. Wismer received moneys belonging to the estate and applied them to his own use; then, becoming insolvent, he executed a mortgage to Halter and himself, as executors of Jantz, to secure the amount of the misappropriated moneys.\nThis action is brought to set aside that mortgage as void against the creditors of Wismer.\nThe mortgage is not void under the statute 13 Eliz. ch. 5. Holbird v. Anderson[21]; Alton v. Harrison[22]; Boldero v. London and Westminster Discount Co.[23] I lately discussed these and other cases in Whitman v. Union Bank of Halifax[24].\nIs it void under the Ontario Act, R.S.O. (1887) ch. 124, which is entitled \u201cAn Act respecting Assignments and Preferences by Insolvent Persons\u201d?\nI shall refer again farther on to the title of the act.\nThe second section declares that the assignment of any property, real or personal, made by a person at a time when he is in insolvent circumstances, or is unable to pay his debts in full, or knows that he is on the eve of insolvency, with intent to defeat, delay or prejudice his creditors, or to give to any one or more of them a preference over his other creditors, or over any one or more of them, or which has such effect, shall, as against them, be utterly void.\nThis differs in two or three respects from the statute of 13 Eliz. Its scope is more limited because it applies only to insolvent persons, and its effect with regard to those persons is more extensive because it includes preferences of particular creditors among its prohibitions, and makes its operation depend not on intention alone but also on the effect of the transaction.\nI do not read the enactment as requiring the concurrence of the two things, the intent and the effect. A transfer made by an insolvent person with intent to defeat or delay creditors, or to give a preference to one or more creditors over the others, is made void as against creditors although no creditor shall be actually defeated or delayed, and no preference actually obtained, by means of it.\nIn that case the intent must be established in the same way as under the statute of Elizabeth, and the apparent object of the transaction may be explained by proof of pressure or some motive which rebuts the forbidden intent. But if the result is the defeating or delaying or giving a preference, if the transaction has such effect, then the statute dispenses with inquiry as to the intent. It might not be incorrect to say that the effect being produced the intent is conclusively presumed if, as under the statute of Elizabeth, the intent were essential to the avoidance of the transfer. With our minds trained under that statute it may be hard to dissociate the two ideas, but the language of the Ontario act, \u201cor which has such effect,\u201d is very plain, and to my mind makes the effect of the transaction decisive without respect to the intent. The motive of the legislature was avowed in the preamble of the statute by which the clause was cast in its present form, 48 Vic. ch. 26. Questions were constantly arising respecting the intent of transactions impeached under the law as it stood in R.S.O. (1877) ch. 118. An attempt had been made by 47 Vic. ch. 10, sec. 3 to couple with the intent to give a preference among creditors the effect or the tendency of a transfer to create a preference, but the amendment was not happily expressed and failed in its purpose. Then the legislature, in the following session, enacted the clause as we now find it, reciting that \u201cwhereas great difficulty is experienced in determining cases arising under the present law relating to transfers of property by persons in insolvent circumstances, or on the eve of insolvency, and it is desirable to remedy the same.\u201d\nAlong with this recital may be noticed the fact that the term \u201cfraudulent\u201d which had been used in the title of ch. 118 of the R.S.O. (1877) and in the previous statute which was there represented and which is replaced by section 2 of the act of 48 Vic., which term, applied as it was in that title to preferences led, in my apprehension, to much of the difficulty referred to in this recital, is dropped in the act of 48 Vic. and in R.S.O. (1887) ch. 124.\nThe effort to remove the recited difficulty will turn out to be unsuccessful if we refuse to give their plain and direct force to the terms in which the legislative will is expressed. There is no reason or warrant for our so refusing.\nThese views I understand to be the same as those of Mr. Justice Osler who dissented in the court below, and I do not understand any of the learned judges of that court to find fault with them as a matter of prin- ciple. But when we come to the practical interpretation of the clause three of the learned judges, one of whom further holds that the intent as well as the effect must appear, read the words \u201cor which has such effect\u201d as applying only to preferential transfers, and not to those that may defeat, delay or prejudice creditors without giving a preference to one creditor over another.\nThis reading of the clause is, to my apprehension, far away from the plain grammatical reading of the language as well as widely apart from what I take to be the expressed object of the legislature in framing it. The language is \u201cwith intent to defeat, delay or prejudice his creditors or to give to any one or more of them a preference over his other creditors or over any one or more of them.\u201d That is the description of the intent, an intent to do any one of the things enumerated; a transfer made with that intent, that is to say an intent to do any one of those things, \u201cor which has such effect,\u201d that is the effect of doing any one of those things, shall be void against creditors.\nIf these qualifying words \u201cor which has such effect\u201d are not to apply equally to all the objects of the intent on equal footing it must be by reason of some overruling policy or principle that will justify a distinct violence to language which is not itself ambiguous or indefinite.\nThe preamble of the statute does not suggest any idea of discrimination. To defeat or delay creditors or to give a preference stood on precisely the same footing in the law under which difficulties were experienced which it was desired to remedy. A new term was introduced in the act 48 Vic. ch. 26, viz., to prejudice creditors, and the four things, defeat, delay, prejudice, prefer, now stand each in precisely the same grammatical relation to the enacting words as the others. The legislature has adopted the policy of resting the validity of a transfer by an insolvent person on the effect without inquiry into the intent. It is argued that that is only when a preference is accorded. Why should that be so? Assuming the policy to be sound policy, and it is not our province to question it, why should a transfer which merely disturbs the equality among the creditors be dealt with more strictly than one that defeats all the creditors? If the fact of giving a preference is to be fatal to one, the other ought not to be treated with greater tenderness.\nIt was held by all the learned judges of appeal that the mortgage had not the effect of giving a preference to one or more creditors over the others within the meaning of the statute because the mortgagees were not creditors of Wismer, or, in the guarded language of Mr. Justice Osler, were not creditors in the strict sense of the word. I shall show why I differ from that conclusion, but if it was not a transfer to creditors it was one that had the effect of defeating, delaying or prejudicing the creditors and is, therefore, as against the creditors, utterly null and void. I agree in that particular with Mr. Justice Osler.\nThat ground would be sufficient for the allowance of this appeal, but the other question is an important one on the construction of the statute and must be considered.\nIt is not and cannot be denied that when Wismer applied the trust money to his own use he became liable in a civil action at the suit of somebody. The form of action is of no consequence. It might be what in former times was an action at law, as money had and received, if the money was appropriated to an individual cestui que trust, or it might have been by suit in equity if nothing had been done to alter the relation of trustee and cestui que trust. See many cases collect- ed in Bullen and Leake\u2019s treatise on pleading[25]. He became a debtor to some one. It would be so even if the money had been feloniously stolen. See Chowne v. Baylis[26], where one question put and answered in the affirmative by Sir J. Romilly, M.R., was this: If one man takes the property of another does such taking constitute in the eye of the law a debt from the thief to the person robbed? The liability is not less a debt by reason of its being incurred by a breach of trust, whether an express or an implied trust. See Emma Silver Mining Co. v. Grant[27], where a specific sum was found due from the defendant, who was financial agent and promoter of the company, to the company for the secret profit made on a transaction. One head-note is\nHeld, also, that the debt so due from G. was incurred by \u201cfraud\u201d and also \u201cbreach of trust\u201d within section 49 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1869, and that accordingly G. was not released from such debt by his discharge; and he was thereupon ordered personally to pay such debt to the company, or so much thereof as should not be received by the company under the liquidation.\nSee also to the same effect Cooper v. Pritchard[28] where a bankrupt was refused his discharge from a debt incurred by the fraud of his partner who misappropriated money intrusted to the firm for investment. Brett, M.R., there referred to the well known rule, which I venture to think has been somewhat overlooked in the present case, that in construing an act of parliament one has no right to introduce words into the enactment unless it is obvious that it cannot be made sensible without them. See also Evans v. Bear[29] where an order having been made against two executors jointly to pay into court money misappropriated by one of them an attachment was issued against the innocent executor as well as the other, the point decided being that he came within the third exception to the fourth section of the act for abolition of imprisonment for debt, the Debtors\u2019 Act, 1869, which excludes from the operation of the section \u201cdefault by a trustee or a person acting in a fiduciary capacity and ordered to pay by a court of equity any sum in his possession or under his control.\u201d Cobham v. Dalton[30] was a case where a trustee, who had been ordered to pay into court trust money which he had mixed with his own, was adjudicated a bankrupt It was held that although the debt was one from which an order of discharge would not release him still, as it was a debt provable under the bankruptcy, he was, pending the bankruptcy proceedings, protected from attachment for disobedience to the order by section 12 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1869, which enacted that\nWhere a debtor shall be adjudicated a bankrupt no creditor to whom the bankrupt is indebted shall have any remedy against the person or property of the bankrupt in respect of such debt, except in manner directed by this act.\nIn Ex parte Kelly & Co. In re Smith, Fleming & Co.,[31] Kelly & Co., at Glasgow, remitted money to Smiths, Fleming & Co., at London, to pay in retiring certain bills. They intended to appropriate the money to that purpose and never applied it to their own use, though a part was paid by mistake into their own bank in place of the Bank of England, and about the time of their bankruptcy endeavored to correct the mistake. That was held not to be a payment made voluntarily and by way of preferring a particular creditor. James, L.J., thus states the law:\nNo doubt if a trustee commits a breach of trust by stealing or otherwise misappropriating the trust moneys he becomes a debtor to his cestui que trust in respect of the money which he has thus improperly taken, and if he becomes a debtor in that way he remains only a debtor, and the cestui que trust only a creditor, unless he can ear-mark the money which the trustee has misappropriated,\nand so on.\nIt is indisputable that Wismer was a debtor and that the person or persons to whom he owed the money, whether the executors or beneficiaries, whether known and ascertained individually or called by the comprehensive name of the estate, were his creditors. They could clearly have proved for the debt as creditors under an assignment for the general benefit of creditors under the Ontario act. If the money was appropriated to them, as Wismer proposed to do when he told Halter that he was ruined and would like to save the money of the estate that he had used if he could, and as he tried to do by executing the mortgage, it undoubtedly gave a preference to those creditors over the others, and so the transfer came literally within the terms of the statute.\nBut it has been held that it is not within the statute because the transfer was not made to a creditor. I am not prepared to concede that the executors were not creditors of Wismer. It was the duty of Halter to protect the interest of the cestuis que trustent by active measures against his co-executor, and he would be the proper person to prove the debt under the statute.\nA trustee is called upon, if a breach of trust be threatened, to prevent it by obtaining an injunction, and if a breach of trust has been already committed, to bring an action for the restoration of the trust fund to its proper condition, or at least to take such other active measures as, with a due regard to all the circumstances of the case, may be considered most prudential.\nLewin on Trusts[32], citing Brice v. Stokes[33], In re Chertsey Market[34], Franco v. Franco[35], Walker v. Symonds[36] and other cases, and see Styles v. Guy[37], per Lord Cottenham; Williams v. Nixon[38], per Lord Langdale; Booth v. Booth[39], Lincoln v. Wright[40], which related to executors.\nBut there is not a word in the statute on which to found the doctrine that the transfer must be to a creditor. What is forbidden is a transfer which gives a preference to one creditor over the others, no matter who the transferee may be. It is the effect of the transaction, not the shape it is put in, that is dealt with.\nI respectfully submit that the decision is an instance of introducing words into a statute which, without them, is perfectly plain. The words are imported from the English Bankruptcy Acts, either section 92 of the act of 1869, or section 48 of the act of 1883, which are similar in their words and read thus:\nEvery conveyance or transfer of property made by any person unable to pay his debts as they become due from his own money in favor of any creditor, or any person in trust for any creditor, with a view of giving such creditor a preference over the other creditors, shall, if the person making the same is adjudged bankrupt within three months after the date of the same, be deemed fraudulent and void as against the trustee in bankruptcy.\nHere we have forbidden a transfer made in favor of any creditor or person in trust for any creditor, with a view to give such creditor a preference. That is to say, it must be made to the creditor himself who is preferred, or to some one in trust for him. We have no such provision. The section of the Bankruptcy Acts has been construed very literally, and perhaps with unnecessary strictness, in the courts as appears from dicta in cases relied on in the court below. The cases really were decisions that the transactions in question were not with a view to prefer creditors because the motive was to restore trust funds or to escape prosecu-\n[Page 113\ntion for misappropriating them, but the other point was alluded to.\nThus in Ex parte Stubbins. In re Wilkinson[41] it was held that if a debtor on the eve of bankruptcy voluntarily makes good trust moneys which he has misapplied the payment cannot be set aside under the Bankruptcy Act as a fraudulent preference. James L.J. concluded his judgment by stating the doctrine that if a debtor on the eve of insolvency, and just before he becomes bankrupt, sells goods in order that he may restore money which he has taken from his master, or from anybody else, and does restore the money, it seems impossible to hold that such a payment can be treated as a voluntary preference of a creditor. The defaulting trustee had induced his co-trustee to buy part of his goods in order that he might replace trust moneys which he had misappropriated. That was held not to be a fraudulent transfer to the purchaser. He paid the money to the credit of the two trustees in the banking account of the trust estate, and as to that the Lord Justice said\nI am of opinion that it is impossible to bring such a transaction within the doctrine of voluntary preference of a creditor. In order to do that there must be a payment or a transfer of goods to a creditor or to somebody in trust for a creditor. Here the creditor was the trust estate, if it could be called a creditor.\nThen followed the general statement of law already quoted. This dictum is relied on as some authority for the construction of the Ontario Act. It is obviously an example of the strict reading of the words which have no equivalent in the Ontario Act, while the decision of the case is on the question of intent which the latter statute excludes.\nAnother case relied on is Ex parte Taylor. In re Goldsmid[42]. It follows Ex parte Stubbins41 on both points, as will sufficiently appear from a short passage from the judgment of Lord Esher, M.R.\nWith regard to the other ground, the execution of the deed of the 23rd of March, the bankrupt had been guilty of a gross, and perhaps a fraudulent, breach of trust, and an application was made to him by Taylor, his co-trustee, to replace the trust money which had been lost. I do not say that threats were made use of, but great pressure was put on him. The relation of debtor and creditor did not exist between the parties. The relation was only that of trustee, honest trustee and defaulting trustee. No action of debt could have been maintained for the sum which was paid, and such a case is not within s. 48 at all. But even if Taylor could be regarded as a creditor of the bankrupt I think the other view comes in; the bankrupt had committed a gross breach of trust, and it could not be said that he executed the deed with a view of preferring Taylor to whom it could bring no personal benefit. The deed must have been executed with the view of making good the breach of trust. Consequently, there was no fraudulent preference and no act of bankruptcy.\nTwo other cases were referred to in the court below, Re Mills. Ex parte the Official Receiver[43], and Ex parte Ball. Re Hutchinson[44], which is found only in the weekly notes. They add nothing to the others.\nEx parte Kelly[45], which I have noticed, was not mentioned in the judgments. It was there held, two years before the case of Stubbins, that the provisions of section 92 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1869, apply only to transactions between a debtor and persons who are, in the strict sense of the words, his creditors.\nI may add all these cases to the list I have given as examples of the recognition of a debt created by a breach of trust as being a debt as fully as when created in any other way.\nWe have to interpret our own statute which differs in the important particulars which I have pointed out from the clause in the English acts, and which, in its present form passed in 1885, long after the Bank- ruptcy Act, 1869, and after nearly all the decisions cited under that act and the act of 1883, continues to avoid the form of words on which those decisions turn. It aims at the equal distribution of the assets of insolvent persons among their creditors without preference or priority except in defined cases of privilege which do not come in question under the second section.\nI am clearly of opinion that Wismer was a debtor in respect of the money in question; that the ground on which this appeal should be decided is not that the effect of the mortgage of Halter was to defeat or delay or prejudice creditors, as it would be if not given in respect of a debt, but that it had the effect of providing for this debt in preference to his other debts.\nIf it were essential to the operation of the statute, as it is held to be under the strict reading of the English Bankruptcy Acts, that the transfer should be to a creditor I am prepared to hold that Halter was a creditor, having as executor a legal right\u2014joint if not several\u2014to the money, being entitled by a civil action to compel its restitution to him or to him and his co-executor, and if necessary to prove as creditor for the debt in any proceedings for the administration of the estate of Wismer, whether under the statute in question or otherwise.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for Appellants: Bowlby & Clement.\nSolicitors for Respondent: W.

J. RITCHIE C.J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court confirming the report of the official referee in favor of the Water commissioners. The Intercolonial Railway had made certain alterations in the railway works at St. John, which necessitated repairs to the water service at the railway station. The case depends upon the arrangement made between Gilbert Murdock, the superintendent of the water supply, and Mr. Archibald, the chief engineer of the Intercolonial Railway, of which the two parties give very different accounts. Mr. Murdock says that he was not aware that the railway contemplated making the changes that they did, and he further says:\u2014\nI never received any notice; it was first reported to me by one of my own men, who told me what was being done to the track; then I reported the matter to our commissioners.\nQ.\u2014Would the lowering of the grade result in exposing your pipe? A.\u2014Yes. As soon as I heard of what was being done I reported to our commissioners, telling them that our pipes were being exposed. Then a meeting of the commissioners was held and my report was submitted to that meeting, when the commissioners proposed the placing of an injunction upon the work that was done for the reason that they had not been notified.\nQ.\u2014In consequence of what the commissioners did, were you not instructed to go and see Mr. Archibald? A.\u2014Yes. I was then instructed to proceed to Moncton, for the purpose of interviewing Mr. Archibald as to what was being done at the station, and to ascertain from him what were the nature of the changes.\nMr. Murdock then proceeded to state that he went to Moncton and saw Mr. Archibald, and in discussing the price of the work he told Mr. Archibald that he thought it would cost $3,000 or $4,000, at which Mr. Archibald seemed surprised and he then gives this account of what took place:\nMr. Archibald then very fairly said he did not wish to do anything to injure our works and that he would see that nothing was done to injure them. He then asked me if I would look after the matter on his account and do whatever was necessary to be done, and do it fairly as between the Railway Department and our commissioners. I said that as a matter of friendship I would do so.\nMr. Murdock then states that the work was proceeded with until completed, and on cross-examination he says:\nI never saw any engineer. I was left entirely to my own judgment and I acted all through on the strength of the conversation I had with Mr. Archibald. In consequence of this I endeavored to do the work as honestly and fairly between the two bodies as possible, without receiving any remuneration beyond my regular salary.\nAn again he says:\nI proceeded on the directions I received from Mr. Archibald.\nQ.\u2014What were the directions? A.\u2014That I was to do the work to the best of my judgment.\nQ.\u2014What did you do? A.\u2014Acting on these directions, I did the best I could.\nM. Archibald gave a different account of this; but the statement of the engineer and superintendent of the commissioners, Gilbert Murdock, is corroborated by the fact that he reduced the conversation with Archibald to writing and made a memo. of it in his diary, and by the further fact that he sent from Moncton to Mr. Smith, Chief Commissioner in St. John, particulars of the arrangement with Archibald. As to the necessity for the work being done, the following appears in Mr. Murdock's evidence:\u2014\nQ.\u2014When this change was made by the commissioners, in Dorchester street, was it not thought that an overhead crossing would be put up? A.\u2014While this work was going on, in consequence of their being no engineer to attend to it and in consequence of Mr. Archibald's absence, no one knew whether Dorchester street was to be closed as Southwark street had been, whether it was to be a level crossing as Mill street had been, or whether it was to be bridged. All these points were up for discussion, and as there was no one to give the necessary, information we were left entirely in the dark, so had to come to our own conclusions as to what was to be done to the street after the railway was completed and the pipes were laid.\nAnd further on the following appears:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Was it your opinion at the time that these repairs or changes were being made in the railway, that in consequence of the work there a number of stop-cocks should be placed there in order to shut off the water in the way you have mentioned? A.\u2014I considered them really essential. I did not put them in for ornament or to increase the cost. I would have done the same had I been doing the work on our own account.\"\nAnd he afterwards gave the following evidence:\u2014\nQ.\u2014You were speaking before adjournment of your experience, and you said, that the alterations which were made at the station rendered it necessary for the water supply of and in consequence of the increased traffic over the road at that point to make the changes which you made? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014And under these circumstances you considered these stop-cocks necessary to be put in? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014And in consequence of the alterations which were made at the station you considered the placing of the stop-cocks a necessity? A. Under the changed conditions, I considered it necessary to place stopcocks there.\nQ.\u2014Why did you consider them necessary? A.\u2014On account of the extra risk and the greater responsibility we had to run in regard to both port and the city. There was also an extra amount of traffic passing over the road at this point, and this required us to take extra precautions to prevent any accident taking place.\nQ.\u2014As a matter of prudence and professional skill, was it in your opinion necessary to do what was done by you? In my judgment it was absolutely necessary\u2014that is, for the protection of the place and for the safety of everybody.\nArchibald then allowed the work to go on without plans or rendering any assistance to Murdock, leaving the work entirely to the discretion and judgment of Murdock.\nHere we have, then, a professional man, an engineer who had been thirty-eight years in the employment of the water commissioners of St. John, giving this account for the necessity of the work and the agreement entered into with Mr. Archibald; it is shown that he was left without assistance and the whole burden was put upon his shoulders, and upon his alone. Certainly it must be admitted, and I state it without fear of contradiction, that no person could be more competent to do the work than a man who had been in charge of the water service of St. John since the year 1849. He swears that he acted honestly and faithfully, and there is not a word to indicate that he did not act in good faith. All the work charged for was no doubt actually done and the prices for the materials supplied were paid for at reasonable rates. I think the observations of the referee as to the evidence of the civil engineers who were brought there to make estimates and to cut down the expenditure were very just. After epitomizing the evidence and pointing out the work that was done and the reasons assigned for the changes that were made, he says:\u2014\nThe engineer was called on behalf of respondent to say that the change would have been made differently and at much less cost. In my opinion Mr. Murdock was the best judge of the necessities of the case.\nAnd he proceeds to state the contention of the claimants and the inconvenience of having the work done in a different way from what it was doue. In another place the referee says:\u2014\nThe respondent, taking the view that it was only necessary to lower the pipes on Dorchester street within a certain distance on either side of the railway track, brings forward four civil engineers to testify as to what, in their opinion, is required to place the pipes in as good apposition as they were before being stripped;\nthen, after stating the work necessary to be done in this respect\u2014the expensive character of the required changes\u2014he proceeds as follows:\u2014\nWho was the person most competent to judge of what was prudent and necessary to be done in view of the altered circumstances? Certainly; it was Mr. Gilbert Murdock, who has an experience of the requirements and thorough knowledge of the water system of St. John and Portland for a period extending over forty years, and who has all the responsible duties of chief engineer resting upon him, and not persons who naturally must possess but a slight and superficial knowledge of the system and having no responsibilities regarding it. Even Mr. Keating, witness for the respondent, admits this in his evidence, for he says, that Mr. Murdock, with all his knowledge of the water works system, was in a better positioned had a better means of knowing what was prudent and advisable to be done. I entirely adopt that language as being in entire accordance with my own view of the case; a skilled man has done the work and swears that he did it honestly and faithfully, and made no expenditure not necessary for the purposes of the work to be done. Even Mr. Keating, an intelligent man and a civil engineer, admits this, and it cannot be disputed. Then there was an objection made as to the time taken for the work, delay in getting castings, &c., which was satisfactorily explained by Mr. Murdock.\nThen the referee goes on to say:\nThe work had been thrown upon them suddenly and Mr. Murdock was left alone in the matter, and had to exercise his own judgment altogether, there being none of the engineering staff of the railway on the ground during the whole time of the work. I cannot conceive that Mr. Murdock would have made the changes he did unless he acted under the firm conviction that he had the concurrence of the railway authorities in what he was doing, and the fact that no objection was made at any time during the process of the work would naturally lead him to believe that the respondent was acting in good faith, that he was fully carrying out what he considered the arrangements with Mr. Archibald and acting in his interest, and doing only what he considered was requisite under the changed condition of things. Mr. Murdock had no special interest in the matter beyond doing what he considered his duty honestly towards both parties, and he swears that no benefit accrued to him pecuniarily or otherwise;\nand the conclusion the referee came to was to recommend to the court that the claimants be paid the amount of their claim.\nNow, assuming that there was an error of judgment who should bear the loss of it? Should it be the commissioners of St. John or the railway authorities who left everything in the hands of Murdock and offered him no assistance? If he exercised good faith then the railway authorities had no right to complain, and I am satisfied that Mr. Murdock, experienced as he was in matters of this kind and, as I believe him to be, a perfectly honest and intelligent man, should not have the imputation cast on him now that he went out of his way to benefit the water commissioners which would be a stigma which I think he ought not to bear. The judgment of the referee was affirmed by the Exchequer Court and should not, I think, be disturbed. In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.\nSTRONG J.\u2014This is a claim made by the respondents for damage caused to their works in consequence of alterations made in the line and permanent way of the Intercolonial Railway in lowering the pipes and making changes in the water works by the Intercolonial Railway authorities.\nThe case (originally commenced by Petition of Right in the Exchequer Court) was referred to one of the official referees, who reported in favor of allowing compensation to the respondents amounting to $2,655.62. From this report there was an appeal to the Exchequer Court where the referee's report was confirmed. The learned judge of the Exchequer Court, in the judgment which he pronounced in the appeal from the referee, after referring to the report for a statement of the facts, proceeds as follows:\u2014\nThere is no question but that the claimants' property was injuriously affected by the alteration and improvements made in 1884 by the Minister of Railways and Canals in the yard and tracks of the Intercolonial Railway at and near the St. John Station, and that the claimants were entitled to take such steps and to execute such works as were necessary to make their property as good, safe and serviceable as it was before the interference therewith and to recover from the defendant the expense thereby incurred. They were not entitled, however, to improve the water system and service of the City of Portland at the crown's expense. They were entitled to be fully indemnified for any injury done, but to nothing more.\nThe learned judge then proceeds to point out that the respondents in the works which they executed exceeded the limits indicated and that a very considerable proportion of the claim made is for works and materials which have added to the permanent value and utility of the claimants' property, but which cannot be fairly said to have been rendered necessary by anything done by the Minister of Railways or the officers of the Department.\nI entirely agree in this portion of the judgment of Judge Burbidge, both as regards the statement made of the result of the evidence showing that more work had been done and allowed for by the referee than was requisite to put the respondents in statu quo, and also in the learned judge's view of the law, that beyond mere compensation and indemnity for actual injury the respondents were not prim\u00e2 facie entitled to recover. I cannot, however, bring myself to agree with the learned judge when he goes beyond this and confirms the referee in awarding an amount considerably beyond what would have been requisite to have given the respondents full indemnity and compensation. The excess beyond this amount was awarded because it was considered to have been proved that the Government engineers had acquiesced in the work done by the respondents in excess of what was required to restore their works to their original condition. Although it appears to me that the evidence of such acquiescence is far from conclusive I do not proceed upon the mere insufficiency of the proof, but upon the entire want of any authority in the engineers to bind the crown, assuming that they acquiesced in the fullest manner.\nThe title to compensation is of course statutory, but as such it is limited to an indemnity, and beyond this compensation to the extent of an indemnity I know of no authority short of Parliament by which the crown can be bound to pay damages in excess of compensation. Even granting that such may have been done by the Governor General in Council or by the direction and sanction of the Minister of Railways, no such order in council, direction or sanction is proved, and in the absence of any of these authorities I am unable to see to what source the legal liability of the crown to make good the excess beyond an indemnity can be referred.\nThe amount in question is not, it is true, large, but we must bear in mind that this decision will make a precedent, and I conceive we should thus make a very dangerous precedent were we to determine that the crown might be bound beyond its statutory liability by the agreements and acquiescence of its subordinate officers.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be allowed and the case referred back to the Exchequer Court to ascertain the proper amount due for compensation, estimated on proof of the expenditure which would have been required to restore the respondents' works to the state they were in before being interfered with for the purposes of the railway.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The learned judge of the Exchequer Court has found as matter of fact, and in this I entirely concur with him, \"that a very considerable portion of the claims of the respondents is for work and materials which added to the permanent value and utility of their property, but which cannot be fairly said to have been rendered necessary by anything done by the Minister of Railways, or the officers of his Department.\" He lays down very accurately, in my opinion, the principle of law applicable to the case in his judgment, as follows:\u2014\nThere is no question but that the claimants' property was injuriously affected by the alterations and improvements made in 1884, by the Minister of Railways and Canals, in the yards and tracks of the Intercolonial Railway at and near the St. John station, and that the claimants were entitled to take such steps, and to execute such works, as were necessary to make their property as safe, good and serviceable as it was before the interference therewith, and to recover from the defendant the expense thereby incurred.\nThey were not entitled, however, to improve the water system and service of the City of Portland at the crown's expense. They were entitled to be fully indemnified for any injury done, and for nothing more. Now it appears clear to me that the claimants, in the extent and character of the works which they executed and the expense which they incurred, exceeded the limit which I have indicated.\nThe learned judge then proceeds in the language first above extracted from his judgment, but concludes however, with hesitation it is true, as he says, in affirming the claim of the water commissioners for a reason in which I cannot concur, namely, that under the circumstances which occurred and the conversations which took place between the commissioners and their engineers on the one part, and the engineer of the railway on the other, the engineer of the commissioners is to be regarded as having been employed by the Department of Railways to execute the work in such manner as he thought fit at the expense of the Department. The suppliants' petition of right is not framed as in assertion of a claim that the work done by the suppliants and charged for was necessary for the mere purpose of reinstating their works in as good a condition after the completion of the improvements which were being made on the Intercolonial Railway as they were in before such improvements were undertaken. The suppliants, on the contrary, base their claim on the 6th, 7th, 10th and 11th paragraphs of their petition of right upon a contract alleged to have been entered into between them and the Dominion Government by Her Majesty, substantially to the effect that, if the suppliants would make such changes in their works and water mains and in the situation and level thereof as might be reasonable and necessary to render and keep the same in a serviceable and efficient state after the alterations on the railway should be completed, Her Majesty would pay to and reimburse the suppliants the costs and value of such changes. And they aver that after they had made the changes in their works they were ratified and adopted by Her Majesty, who afterwards promised the suppliants to pay to them the costs and value thereof.\nThat considerable changes and improvements in the water works were made for the express purpose of improving the water supply and of giving to the citizens abetter supply and greater security than they had before, and which were not necessary for the mere purpose of reinstating the works in as good a condition as they were in before, was not, in my opinion, disputed on the evidence, but it was contended that all that was done and charged to the Minister of Railways was necessary to the changes and improvements made in the water works, which changes and improvements were, as was contended, agreed upon before they were undertaken by and between the Minister, through the medium of Mr. Archibald the engineer of the Intercolonial Railway, and the commissioners of the Water Works and their engineer, Mr. Murdock.\nBetween Mr. Archibald and Mr. Murdock there is an unfortunate conflict as to what did take place between them; but the case does not, in my opinion, turn upon a question as to which of their memories is most likely to be in error, for I think that neither the commissioners or their engineer had any right to suppose that the engineer of the railway had a right to bind the Government, if he did affect to do so, by whatever it was which passed between Mr. Archibald and the commissioners or their engineer. They had no right to suppose that Mr. Archibald could bind the Government by anything he should say to any greater extent than should be necessary to reinstate the water works in as good a condition as they were in before, and to this extent the claim of the respondents has not been disputed, but as the water works were improved to a much greater extent the Dominion Government cannot, in my opinion, be made answerable for any works done in excess of what was necessary to reinstate the works in as good condition as they were in before\u2014and therefore this appeal should be allowed. As a majority of the court, however, are of a contrary opinion I have not gone into the question as to how much the claim of the respondents was in excess of what in my opinion they had a right to charge for.\nPATTERSON J. concurred with the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: E.
